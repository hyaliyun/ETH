While primarily designed for anti-tank use, it provides standoff strike capability against a variety of point targets such as APCs, ships, bunkers, personnel concentrations and guerrillas. Nimrod has a semi-active laser guidance system, capable of day and night operation. Its flight trajectory can be set below obscuring cloud layers, while a forward scouting team uses a laser designator to direct it from up to 26 km behind. Nimrod may be installed on a variety of towed launchers, light combat vehicle launchers, helicopters, and fixed-wing aircraft. The primary helicopter launch platform for the Nimrod in the Israel Defense Forces is a modified CH-53 helicopter; this is not only due to the relatively large size and weight of the Nimrod missile, but because the CH-53 is a common delivery vehicle for Israeli special operations teams. The launching vehicle or aircraft may fire up to 4 Nimrods at once from a single pack. Development/Description Israel Aircraft Industries MBT Weapon Systems Division has developed the solid propellant fuelled day/ night-capable Nimrod long-range ground-launched semi-active laser-guided anti-tank guided weapon (ATGW) in response to an export requirement. The Israeli Defence Force has also expressed interest. Nimrod can also be used as an anti-ship weapon. Nimrod is transonic in operation and is powered all the way to the target. The gunner preselects the flight trajectory mode. This can be direct trajectory, high cruising trajectory or low cruising trajectory, the cruising altitude being constant and between 300 and 1,500 m. Mid-course guidance is provided by an integral inertial platform, and terminal guidance by a semi-active laser homing seeker for the last 15 to 30 seconds of missile flight. The target can be illuminated either by a ground-based or airborne laser designator. The gimballed and stabilised seeker head acquires, tracks and homes in on its target using localised proportional navigation. It is said to have a look angle of more than 30¬∞. The seeker has a search area of 5 km in width and 5 km in depth. In the terminal flight phase the weapon adopts a dive angle of approximately 45¬∞ to strike the armoured target on its vulnerable upper surfaces. The missile is stored in a sealed canister which also acts as the launcher. Total weight of the missile and canister is 150 kg. It has five main sections: seeker, guidance and control, warhead, solid propellant rocket motor and servo. It is roll-stabilised in flight. Time to come into action at a launch site is less than 3 minutes without the site having to be surveyed for alignment or levelling, or with a direct line of sight to the target. The weapon can be fired in single-round, ripple or salvo modes. In addition to the AMX-13 light tank tracked chassis application mentioned below there is also a truck (4 x 4) model with a pod of four missiles in the ready to launch position at the rear, firing over the cab. Modified AMX-13 light tank chassis (two eight-round container-launcher installations - unknown export customer). Production of Nimrod is complete. It is in service with an unidentified export customer.  Versions  Currently two versions of Nimrod exist: * Long Range, Dual Mode Missile ‚Äì NIMROD 2 A dual mode Laser/GPS Homing missile, the Nimrod 2 has a range of 36 km and features a mobile launcher. The warhead is 14 kg, and the missile can support various warheads for a variety of targets. * Long Range, Dual Mode Missile ‚Äì NIMROD 3 A dual mode Laser/GPS Homing missile, the Nimrod 3 has a range of 10-50 km and can support various warheads for a wide range of targets.

Some 2000 dwellings were built from 1945 to 1960. The houses built in the time period immediately following World War II were meant for returning veterans and are therefore known as \\"war homes\\" or \\"veteran homes\\". Many of the street names in the neighbourhood also reflect this military heritage (e.g. Viscount Ave, Admiral Ave, General Ave, Marshall Ave, Veteran Ave, Crerar Ave.). From 1961 to 1970, 1440 homes and apartments were built and from 1971 to 1980, another 1380. After 1981, the construction of new dwellings sharply dropped to less than 400 for the remainder of the 20th century. Today there are new homes being built as some of the veterans homes are demolished. A notable geographic feature in the neighbourhood is Carlington Hill, a large hill with long gradual slopes. Part of it was formerly a ski hill with tow lift (known as Anne Heggtveit Hill), but now used as a City of Ottawa approved sledding hill. The western part of the hill was quarried for limestone, which was crushed and used as lime for the production of cement. The former quarry is now used as a city snow dump. Also on top of the hill is the Carlington Heights Reservoir and Pump Station which supplies approximately one third of the City's water. The neighbourhood is home to Westgate Shopping Centre and the Royal Ottawa Hospital. Merivale Road is Carlington's traditional main street and goes through the centre of residential Carlington. There are five places of worship; St. Elizabeth's of the Visitation Roman Catholic Church, √âglise Catholique Romain de Saint-Bonaventure, Church of God of Prophecy, Kehillat Beth Israel synagogue and St Tekle Haimanot Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the only Ethiopian Orthodox church in Ottawa. The Carlington Business Area is west of Kirkwood, north of Carlington Hill, south of the Queensway (417), and east of Maitland. The main streets are Laperierre and Woodward.

The action in the episode directly follows that of the previous two-parter \\"Mary Loves Scoochie\\", which ended with Dick transforming Dr. Liam Neesam, a malevolent alien played by John Cleese, into a chimpanzee. Therefore, the full finale involves a four-episode story arc. Plot Part one In the previous episode, Mary sees how Dick defeats Liam, and becomes distrusting of Dick. After being convinced by Nina and Judith, Mary breaks off her relationship with Dick. In response, Dick reveals his true identity to her. At first she doesn't believe him but is eventually convinced after Dick tells her to reflect on his unorthodox behavior over the years. At the scene of a robbery, Sally discovers Don hiding in a freezer. In an attempt to give him more courage, Sally inadvertently pushes him to quit the force and start a muffin shop. Harry meets a woman named Sam working at the store that was robbed, and makes a date with her later that evening. Harry later sees Sam working at fancy restaurant, but she instructs him to call her Samantha due to the setting. This confuses Harry, leading him to believe he's dating twins. When she arrives at the apartment later, he scrambles around trying to keep the two women apart before it all blows up in his face. Liam complains about Dick's transgression to the Big Giant Head, who orders Dick and the family back to their home planet for taking unauthorized hostile action against a fellow alien. Part two The family resigns themselves to the fact that they'll be leaving Earth, but Dick decides he's going to ask Mary to come with them. Sally reveals to Don that she's a security specialist, and puts him through a crash personality alteration course in an effort to improve his effectiveness as a police officer, and guide him back to the force, making their parting one of respect and camaraderie rather than one of lost love. Harry and Tommy throw a space themed party for the family by running up their credit cards. This party sees many of the series regular side characters gathering at the apartment. Tommy, feigns ambivalence about the mission's end but when left alone in the kitchen he loses his normally cool demeanor and breaks down into uncontrollable sobbing over the team's pending departure. The party culminates with a performance of \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" by an Elvis Costello. In the ending moments of the series, the family sits in the Rambler and the same spot where they first appeared, and discuss all the things they're going to miss on Earth, which prompts Mary to panic and decide that she can't go with them. Dick escorts her out of the Rambler and agrees to perform a memory-wiping technique on her, one that erases her memories of him but leaves the feelings associated with their love still in her mind. Harry leaves his coat behind for Mary to lay on until she regains consciousness. The family sits in the Rambler, and Sally begins to cry. Tommy and Harry begin to sing their mission song. Sally and Dick join in, and as the song reaches its crescendo, the four of them beam away. Alternate ending A cliffhanger was filmed to leave open the possibility for the series to return.

It is one of the founding papers in thermodynamics, along with German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz's 1882 paper \\"Thermodynamik chemischer Vorg√§nge.\\" Together they form the foundation of chemical thermodynamics as well as a large part of physical chemistry. Gibbs's Equilibrium marked the beginning of chemical thermodynamics by integrating chemical, physical, electrical, and electromagnetic phenomena into a coherent system. It introduced concepts such as chemical potential, phase rule, and others, which form the basis for modern physical chemistry. American writer Bill Bryson describes Gibbs's Equilibrium paper as \\"the Principia of thermodynamics\\". On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, was originally published in a relatively obscure American journal, the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, in several parts, during the years 1875 to 1878 (although most cite \\"1876\\" as the key year). It remained largely unknown until translated into German by Wilhelm Ostwald and into French by Henry Louis Le Ch√¢telier. Overview Gibbs first contributed to mathematical physics with two papers published in 1873 in the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences on \\"Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids,\\" and \\"Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by means of Surfaces.\\" His subsequent and most important publication was \\"On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances\\" (in two parts, 1876 and 1878). In this monumental, densely woven, 300-page treatise, the first law of thermodynamics, the second law of thermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, are applied to the predication and quantification of thermodynamic reaction tendencies in any thermodynamic system in a visual, three-dimensional graphical language of Lagrangian calculus and phase transitions, among others. As stated by Henri Louis Le Chatelier, it \\"founded a new department of chemical science that is becoming comparable in importance to that created by Lavoisier.\\" This work was translated into German by W. Ostwald (who styled its author the \\"founder of chemical energetics\\") in 1891 and into French by H. le Chatelier in 1899. Gibbs's \\"Equilibrium\\" paper is considered one of the greatest achievements in physical science in the 19th century and one of the foundations of the science of physical chemistry. In these papers Gibbs applied thermodynamics to the interpretation of physicochemical phenomena and showed the explanation and interrelationship of what had been known only as isolated, inexplicable facts. Gibbs' papers on heterogeneous equilibria included: * Some chemical potential concepts * Some free energy concepts * A Gibbsian ensemble ideal (basis of the statistical mechanics field) * A phase rule Opening section (The energy of the world is constant). (The entropy of the world tends to a maximum) :::::::::::::::::::::::Clausius The comprehension of the laws which govern any material system is greatly facilitated by considering the energy and entropy of the system in the various states of which it is capable. As the difference of the values of the energy for any two states represents the combined amount of work and heat received or yielded by the system when it is brought from one state to the other, and the difference of entropy is the limit of all possible values of the integral: :\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} in which dQ denotes the element of heat received from external sources, and T is the temperature of the part of the system receiving it, the varying values of energy and entropy characterize in all that is essential the effect producible by the system in passing from one state to another. For by mechanical and thermodynamic contrivances, supposedly theoretically perfect, any supply of work and heat may be transformed into any other which does not differ from it either in the amount of work and heat taken together or in the value of the integral: :\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\delta Q}{T} But it is not only in respect to the external relations of a system that its energy and entropy are of predominant importance. As in the case of simple mechanical systems, such as are discussed in theoretical mechanics, which are capable of only one kind of action upon external systems, namely the performance of mechanical work, the function which expresses the capability of the system of this kind of action also plays the leading part in the theory of equilibrium, the condition of equilibrium being that the variation of this function shall vanish, so in a thermodynamic system, such as all material systems are, which is capable of two different kinds of action upon external systems, the two functions which express the twofold capabilities of the system afford an almost equally simple criterion for equilibrium.

It is native to Japan, but is occasionally utilised in western gardens and several cultivars exist for these purposes. Japanese plum yew has been in cultivation in Europe since 1829, and many modern horticulturists are familiar with this Japanese species, named in honor of Charles Stanhope, 4th Earl of Harrington, one of the first to grow the plant in a European garden, at Elvaston.www.derbyshire.gov.uk :Elvaston Gardens Description New shoots of C. harringtonii remain green for three years after forming and have ribs at the leaf bases. The buds are green in colour, globular in shape and very small at only 1 mm in length. There is one rank of leaves present on either side of the shoot, and these rise up above it and curve slightly inwards, forming a narrow V-shape somewhat akin to a dove's wings. The ranks are often vertical, but can be more flattened in shaded parts. The leaves are broadly linear in shape and measure about 5 cm long by 0.3 cm wide. They are abruptly pointed at the apex, leathery in texture and a bright matte yellowish-green on the upper-surface. The abaxial surface, or underside of the leaves, shows two broad, pale to silvery stomatal bands. Coloured plate from the book Flora Japonica, by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini The species is dioecious and the male plants are typically densely covered with pairs of flowers that are pale cream in colour, though they become brown with time, and globular in shape. They are borne on 2 to 4 mm stalks beneath each pair of leaves. Pollen is released from March until May. The female individuals have two pairs of knob-like globose flowers that appear on curved stalks at the bases of the shoots. The fruit is obovoid in shape and measures 2.5 cm long by 1.5 cm wide. They are a smooth and pale green √≠n colour with dark green stipes, though when ripe they turn brown. Taxonomy The Japanese plum yew was first considered to be a yew when it was partially described by Thomas Andrew Knight in 1839 and as such was named Taxus harringtonii. It was reclassified by Philipp Franz von Siebold and Joseph Gerhard Zuccarini in 1846 with a new specific name, Cephalotaxus drupacea. Some botanists consider C. koreana and C. sinensis to be synonymous with C. harringtonii. Although normally found under the name Cephalotaxus harringtonia, that name violates the grammar rules of Botanical Latin and in 2012 was corrected to Cephalotaxus harringtonii. However, this opinion is still not universally accepted by taxonomists and therefore it is acceptable to use Cephalotaxus harringtonia until a definitive position has been agreed. Range and habitat Cephalotaxus harringtonii is present in Japan. Within Japan, the tree ranges from Ky≈´sh≈´ in the south to Hokkaid≈ç in the north. More specifically, it is found in Hondo in the Chiba Prefecture on Mount Kiyosumi, which is located in the Awa District within the Awa Province. It is also found in the Nagasaki Prefecture and the Hiroshima Prefecture. The variety nana is found in eastern Honsh≈´ as well as Hokkaid≈ç, most notably on seaside cliffs and in mountainous areas. They thrive in partial shade on deep, rich soils. Cultivation Cephalotaxus harringtonii has been in cultivation in the United Kingdom since 1829 and is infrequently encountered as a garden specimen. Of the several species that exist in the genus, the Japanese plum yew is the one most often encountered in western gardens. Several cultivars exist: *'Fastigiata' was first selected in 1861 in Japan. It grows to 6 metres in height and it characterised by its broad cluster of erect stems and very dark green leaves that spread all around the stem and are strongly decurved. The shoots are unbranched in the upper parts of the plant, while the lower parts have somewhat chaotic projecting side-shoots that hang down and contain leaves in flat ranks. The flowers are also inconspicuous.

In the 13th century, the Knights Templar built the Saint-Michel de Gignac castle. After the Middle Age, agriculture developed (wheat, olive, vineries,‚Ä¶). The church of Gignac was built in 1780. At that time, Gignac was part of the Marignane seigneurie. The commune was created during the French Revolution. At first, it included Le Rove, which separated in 1835. In 1919, the commune changed its name from Gignac to Gignac-la-Nerthe to differentiate from other towns with the same name. In the 19th century, many migrants from Spain and Italy came to live in the area, but the town only started to grow in the 1960s with the arrival of Pieds-Noirs from Algeria.

Acetone‚Äìbutanol‚Äìethanol (ABE) fermentation is a process that uses bacterial fermentation to produce acetone, n-Butanol, and ethanol from carbohydrates such as starch and glucose. It was developed by chemist Chaim Weizmann and was the primary process used to produce acetone, which was needed to make cordite, a substance essential for the British war industry during World War I. The process The process may be likened to how yeast ferments sugars to produce ethanol for wine, beer, or fuel, but the organisms that carry out the ABE fermentation are strictly anaerobic (obligate anaerobes). The ABE fermentation produces solvents in a ratio of 3 parts acetone, 6 parts butanol to 1 part ethanol. It usually uses a strain of bacteria from the Class Clostridia (Family Clostridiaceae). Clostridium acetobutylicum is the most well-studied and widely used. Although less effective, Clostridium beijerinckii and Clostridium saccharobutylicum bacterial strains have shown good results as well. For gas stripping, the most common gases used are the off-gases from the fermentation itself, a mixture of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas. History The production of butanol by biological means was first performed by Louis Pasteur in 1861. In 1905, Austrian biochemist Franz Schardinger found that acetone could similarly be produced. In 1910 Auguste Fernbach (1860-1939) developed a bacterial fermentation process using potato starch as a feedstock in the production of butanol. Industrial exploitation of ABE fermentation started in 1916, during World War I, with Chaim Weizmann's isolation of Clostridium acetobutylicum, as described in U.S. patent 1315585. The Weizmann process was operated by Commercial Solvents Corporation from about 1920 to 1964 with plants in the US (Terre Haute, IN, and Peoria, IL), and Liverpool, England. The Peoria plant was the largest of the three. It used molasses as feedstock and had 96 fermenters with a volume of 96,000 gallons each. After World War II, ABE fermentation became generally non-profitable, compared to the production of the same three solvents (acetone, butanol, ethanol) from petroleum. During the 1950s and 1960s, ABE fermentation was replaced by petroleum chemical plants. Due to different raw material costs, ABE fermentation was viable in South Africa until the early 1980s, with the last plant closing in 1983. The last operational plant was operated by Green Biologics Ltd. in Minnesota until it shut down in June 2019.http://www.greenbiologics.com/ Improvement attempts In order to be competitive with the petrochemical industry and to replace part of it as soon as possible, the bio-processes need to be able soon to cover a substantial part of the market demand and to be flexible with respect to the market needs and the raw material properties. The most critical aspect in biomass fermentation processes is related to its productivity. The ABE fermentation via Clostridium beijerinckii or Clostridium acetobutylicum for instance is characterized by product inhibition. This means that there is a product concentration threshold that cannot be overcome, resulting in a product stream highly diluted in water. Phase equilibrium diagram for 1-butanol - ethanol - water ternary mixture For this reason, in order to have a comparable productivity and profitability with respect to the petrochemical processes, cost and energy effective solutions for the product purification sections are required to provide a significant product recovery at the desired purity. The main solutions adopted during the last decades have been as follows: * The employment of less expensive raw materials, and in particular lignocellulosic waste or algae; * The microorganisms modifications or the research of new strains less sensitive to the butanol concentration poisoning to increase productivity and selectivity towards the butanol species; * The fermentation reactor optimization aimed at increasing the productivity; * The reduction of the energy costs of the separation and purification downstream processing and, in particular, to carry out the separation in-situ in the reactor; * The use of side products such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, solid wastes and discharged microorganisms and carry out less expensive process wastewater treatments. In the second half of the 20th century, these technologies allowed an increasement in the final product concentration in the broth from 15 to 30 g/L, an increasement in the final productivity from 0.46 to 4.6 g/(L*h) and an increasement in the yield from 15 to 42%. From a compound purification perspective, the main criticalities in the ABE/W product recovery are due to the water-alcohol mixture's non-ideal interactions leading to homogeneous and heterogeneous azeotropic species, as shown by the ternary equilibrium diagram. This causes the separation by standard distillation to be particularly impractical but, on the other hand, allows the exploitation of the liquid- liquid demixing region both for analogous and alternative separation processes. Therefore, in order to enhance the ABE fermentation yield, mainly in situ-product recovery systems have been developed. These include gas stripping, pervaporation, liquid-liquid extraction, distillation via Dividing Wall Column, membrane distillation, membrane separation, adsorption, and reverse osmosis. Green Biologics Ltd. has implemented this at an industrial scale. Moreover, differently from crude oil feedstocks, biomasses nature fluctuates over the year's seasons and according to the geographical location. For this reasons, biorefinery operations need not only to be effective but also to be flexible and to be able to switch between two operating conditions rather quickly.[citation needed] Current perspectives Global n-butanol demand ABE fermentation is attracting renewed interest with an eye on butanol as a renewable biofuel. Sustainability is by far the topic of major concern over the last years. The energy challenge is the key point of the environmental friendly policies adopted by all the most developed and industrialized countries worldwide. For this purpose Horizon 2020, the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme, was funded by the European Union over the 2014-2020 period. The International Energy Agency defines renewables as the centre of the transition to a less carbon-intensive and more sustainable energy system. Biofuels are believed to represent around 30% of energy consumption in transport by 2060. Their role is particularly important in sectors which are difficult to decarbonise, such as aviation, shipping and other long-haul transport. That is why several bioprocesses have seen a renewed interest in recent years, both from a research and an industrial perspective. For this reason, the ABE fermentation process has been reconsidered from a different perspective. Although it was originally conceived to produce acetone, it is considered as a suitable production pathway for biobutanol that has become the product of major interest. Biogenic butanol is a possible substitute of bioethanol or even better and it is already employed both as fuel additive and as pure fuel instead of standard gasoline because, differently from ethanol, it can be directly and efficiently used in gasoline engines. Moreover, it has the advantage that it can be shipped and distributed through existing pipelines and filling stations. Finally biobutanol is widely used as a direct solvent for paints, coatings, varnishes, resins, dyes, camphor, vegetable oils, fats, waxes, shellac, rubbers and alkaloids due to its higher energy density, lower volatility, and lower hygroscopicity. It can be produced from different kinds of cellulosic biomass and can be used for further processing of advanced biofuels such as butyl levulinate as well. The application of n-butanol in the production of butyl acrylate has a wide scope for its expansion, which in turn would help in increasing the consumption of n-butanol globally. Butyl acrylate was the biggest n-butanol application in 2014 and is projected to be worth USD 3.9 billion by 2020.

In 1848 the government of the Canton of Thurgau dissolved the monastery and took over its property. The former abbey church of Saint Ulrich and Saint Afra, decorated in the Baroque style, is noteworthy. History Before the foundation Saint Conrad, Bishop of Constance from 935 to 976, brought back from Jerusalem a fragment of the True Cross, which he presented to the hospital he had founded in the suburb of Stadelhofen and from which it took the name of \\"Crucelin\\"in Latin, \\"Crucis Lignum\\" means \\"wood of the cross\\", although \\"crucelin\\" could also be a MHG diminutive - \\"little cross\\" which later became Crucelingen / Kreuzlingen. In 1093 this hospital was burnt down during hostilities between the Bishop of Constance and the Abbot of St. Gall. Foundation Ulrich I, bishop of Constance from 1111 to 1127, restored the derelict hospital of Kreuzlingen in about 1125 by founding, on the eastern edge of the suburb of Stadelhofen, a house of Augustinian Canons (indeed, one of the earliest) dedicated to Saints Ulrich and Afra.Bishop Ulrich, from the family of the Counts of Dillingen, was a descendant of Saint Ulrich, Bishop of Augsburg.  The first and second buildings  Kloster Kreuzlingen 1633 In 1144 Pope Lucius II, and in 1145 Emperor Frederick Barbarossa took the monastery under their protection. Kreuzlingen became an Imperial abbey. The abbots, now Imperial prelates, were territorial lords of the small lordship of Hirschlatt north of Friedrichshafen, and this was also their place of refuge in times of war. The first monastery, as the result of the construction of the town wall intended to protect Stadelhofen from Appenzell, stood outside the suburb. At the time of the Council of Constance (1414-1418) the abbot of Kreuzlingen gave shelter from 27 to 28 October 1414 to the later deposed Pope John XXIII, who in return granted the abbot the right to use the pontificalia. After the Swabian War, in the Peace of Basle of 15 October 1499 the Duke of Milan ceded the sovereignty of Thurgau to the Swiss. This so angered the inhabitants of Constance that they burned down the abbey of Kreuzlingen. The city was compelled to rebuild the abbey, and on 17 April 1509 Abbot Peter I von Babenberg (1498-1545) was able to rededicate the new church. During the Thirty Years' War, despite the neutrality of the Swiss, an army entered Thurgau via Stein am Rhein, advanced on Kreuzlingen and besieged Constance unsuccessfully, losing several thousand men. When on 2 October the troops left Kreuzlingen, the people of Constance destroyed the abbey a second time. It was now decided that the monastery should not be rebuilt right up against the walls of Constance, but should be removed from it by not less than the distance of a cannon shot.  The third building 1760-1848  On 4 July 1650 the foundation stone of the new premises was laid and on 25 October 1653 the church of Saints Ulrich and Afra was dedicated. It was constructed according to plans by Michael Beer of Vorarlberg, the founder of the Auer Zunft between 1650 and 1653, by the master builder of Constance, Stephan Gunertsreiner, and the mason Melchior Gruber. The Chapel of the Mount of Olives was constructed in 1760, and four years later the church and parts of the monastery were remodelled in the Rococo style. Dissolution The monastery was severely restricted from 1798 by the cantonal government, and despite considerable resourcefulness in developing new educational functions in order to remain in existence, was eventually dissolved in 1848 by the Canton of Thurgau. Some of the buildings, including the library wing and the Lady Chapel with the crypt, were demolished. The remaining buildings were designated for use by the canton's teacher training college. The church was preserved for the use of the town and is now a basilica minor. Church Aftermath of the fire in 1963 In the early 1960s, the church was totally renovated. Shortly afterwards, on the night of 19-20 July 1963, as a result of welding work in the roof of the seminary, the entire building burnt down. The fire did not claim the external walls, the choir screen, the choir ceiling and the choir stalls, or the greater part of the wooden figures in the Chapel of the Mount of Olives. Thanks however to the enormous contributions of the conservator Albert Knoepfli and the deacon Alfons Gm√ºr the church was rebuilt under the direction of Hans Burkard by 1967. The ceiling paintings by Franz Ludwig Herrmann show scenes from the monastic life of Saint Augustine of Hippo. The magnificent choir screen was made in 1737 by Johann Jakob Hoffner. The statues, larger than life-size, of Saints Ulrich and Afra were carved by Hans Christoph Schenk. Of particular interest is the Chapel of the Mount of Olives with a crucifix and a Calvary. The ceiling painting shows Moses with the brazen serpent and is also by Franz Ludwig Herrmann (1761). The representation of the Mount of Olives, made out of beechwood by Innozenz Beck, contains about 250 original statuettes, about 30 centimetres high, carved of Swiss stone pine wood (\\"Arvenholz\\") in about 1720-1730 somewhere in the south-eastern Alpine region.

Overview Hordeum murinum is quite widespread and common. It flowers during May through July in mainly coastal areas. In the British Isles it is absent throughout most of Ireland and Scotland but is common in England and Wales. It can grow to 30 cm in height, and its unbranched spikes can reach 10 cm long. It produces small, dry nutlets and its leaves can be 8 mm wide with short, blunt ligules. It is an annual winter species whose seeds germinate and develop in the spring. It is also referred to as wall barley and are tetraploids. It is distinct from other species of the genus because of its morphology and molecular genetics. It is also distinct because of the barriers it has with the Hordeum taxa when it comes to its ability to cross with other species. Among its subspecies is included H. m. ssp. leporinum, known as hare barley. Growth requirements Hordeum murinum complex is the most widespread of all the other Hordeum species. The center of distribution of H. murinum is in the Mediterranean area, Central Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. A greater quantity of dry material is produced with medium precipitation and better distribution. Precipitation is the most important factor in the production of seeds for this species. In the years that are more dry with early or late rainfalls, there is no chance of re-seeding for this species. The species uses a greater part of its reproductive resources for seed production, allowing it to adapt to different water conditions. Controlling the seeding rate favors high-quality strand of barley. The sowing rate for wall barley increases when seed production and forage increases. This helps to obtain ideal and sustainable forage and seed yield in rangelands of Jordan. The height of the plant and protein content does not respond to seeding rates, but the height of the plant and protein content does vary with years. Anatomical characteristics of leaf blades differ between the taxa. This weedy species along with hare barley and smooth barley can be hard to control. Subspecies One subspecies is Hordeum murinum ssp. leporinum, known as hare barley, mouse barley, and barley grass. In Chinese it's known as m√†iqƒ´ng () and is a common ingredient in the spring snack qƒ´ngtu√°n (). This subspecies grows in tufts from in height, and its flowers are attached to branches rather than to the main axis. It is native to the Mediterranean region near continental, oceanic, and colder climates, as well as northern Africa and temperate Asia, and it is widely naturalised elsewhere. It was first published as the full species H. leporinum by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1834. In 1882 it was redescribed as a subspecies of H. murinum by Giovanni Arcangeli, though today some authorities maintain it at the species level. Another subspecies is H. m. ssp. glaucum. It appears in warmer climates of the Mediterranean region. The above subspecies differ primarily because of their chromosome numbers, spikelet morphology, and geographical distribution. H. leporinum is more dominant in areas where the rainfall is greater than . H. glaucum is more dominant in semiarid regions where rainfall is less than . Within Hordeum, there are 2 subgenera and 4 sections with 4 different genotypes. The clade that is the sister taxon to H. murinum is H. bulbosum and H. vulgare. Uses Weedy barley species is an important component of annual pastures. This is useful for feeding grazing animals. It is also the main source of forage for cattle production in areas with water deficits. Cultural significance In England in the late 20th century among children the plant was referred to colloquially as the 'Flea Dart', from the aerodynamic shape of its seedhead, and the aphids that are often present within it in its immature state.'Wall Barely' entry in the 'Plant-Lore' website (2019). https://www.plant-lore.com/wall-barley/  References  murinum Category:Bunchgrasses of Europe Category:Flora of France Category:Flora of Italy Category:Flora of the United Kingdom Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Hordeum murinum"},{"id":"11695614","text":"HMS Caledonia was a 120-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 25 June 1808 at Plymouth. She was Admiral Pellew's flagship in the Mediterranean. Construction The Admiralty orders for Caledonias construction were issued in November 1794, for a 100-gun vessel measuring approximately 2,600 tons burthen. There were considerable delays in obtaining dockyard facilities and in assembling a workforce, and actual building did not commence until 1805 when the keel was laid down at Plymouth Dockyard. By this time the designs had also been amended to stipulate construction of a 120-gun vessel of 2,616 tons. When completed to this new design in 1808, Caledonia entered Royal Navy service as the largest and most heavily armed vessel of the time.Winfield 2010, p.77 Active service Caledonia proved to be a very successful ship, and it was said that 'This fine three-decker rides easy at her anchors, carries her lee ports well, rolls and pitches quite easy, generally carries her helm half a turn a-weather, steers, works and stays remarkably well, is a weatherly ship, and lies-to very close.' She was 'allowed by all hands to be faultless'. In later years she was to become the standard design for British three-deckers.Lavery, Nelson's Navy, p. 44. On 12 February 1814 she took part with HMS Boyne in action against the French ship of the line Romulus off Toulon; the French vessel managed to escape to Toulon by sailing close to the coast to avoid being surrounded. In 1831 she was part of the Experimental Squadron of the Channel Fleet under Sir Edward Codrington. On 12 September that year she took part in an experiment whereby she was towed by the frigate HMS Galatea by means of hand-worked paddles alone.Major-General Edward Elers Napier, The Life and Correspondence of Admiral Sir Charles Napier K.C.B. (London: Hurst & Blackett, 1862), Volume I, p. 152. In 1856 she was converted to a hospital ship, renamed Dreadnought and became the second floating Dreadnought Seamen's Hospital at Greenwich, where she remained until 1870. In 1871 she was briefly returned to service to accommodate patients recovering from the smallpox epidemic of that year. Towed to the breakers in 1872. http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/images/greenwich/central- greenwich/dreadnought-01221-640.jpg She was broken up in 1875.

The song is a parody of teenage tragedy songs of that period, and has since become a cult classic as a result of frequent airplay on the Dr. Demento show. The singer narrates a traffic crash initially similar to the one described in J.

The singer is the sole survivor, the motorcycle gang and its leader are dead, and his girlfriend is fatally dismembered by the impact (\\"Over there was my baby . . . and over there was my baby . . . and way over there was my baby\\"). After months of unabated grief, the distraught singer, in an apparent fit of insanity, decides that he is going to have his girl back \\"one way or another.\\" With realistic sound effects, he unearths her grave (\\"Oh, baby, I dig you so much!\\"), crawls into her coffin, and closes the lid for a muffled final chorus of \\"I Got My Baby Back.\\" In 1977 British BBC radio DJ Kenny Everett named \\"I Want My Baby Back\\" #1 in the \\"Bottom 30\\" after a public vote, and it won the title of \\"The World's Worst Record\\".Everett, Kenny. \\"The Bottom 30\\", Capital Radio, May 14, 1977.

Family and education Born in York as Albert Childers Thompson, he was the son of Sir Harry Meysey-Thompson, 1st Baronet (1809‚Äì1874) and Elizabeth Anne Croft. Albert's brother Charles played for Wanderers in the 1873 FA Cup Final and the Old Etonians in the first match of the replayed 1876 FA Cup Final. Thompson was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1871. He began studying law at Lincoln's Inn in 1869, before migrating to the Inner Temple in 1872. Sports career Thompson had played football at Eton, and continued while in university for Cambridge University and the Eton Cambridge Football Club. He played at half-back or full-back. C.W. Alcock variously described him as \\"...the king of backs. The ease with which he kicks the ball in the most difficult positions suggests the belief that at one time in his life he must have gone into training with a view to an acrobatic career.\\" He was also praised as \\"the best half-back out, an unerring kick and the most reliable back against any team\\", while in 1876 it was said: \\"Still holds his own as a half-back; one of the most brilliant kickers of the day\\". At the first F.A. Cup Final of 1872, the combination of himself and full-back Edgar Lubbock at play with faultless kicking was said to be a great feature of the match as they repulsed all attempts by the Royal Engineers team to score against the Wanderers, who won 1‚Äì0.Warsop. p. 40.

He was in their team in the 1‚Äì1 drawn first match between them and the Royal Engineers on 13 March 1875 at Kennington Oval, but was unavailable for the replay three days later when the Engineers defeated them in his absence. History repeated itself the following year, when they played against the Wanderers, when again they drew 1‚Äì1. In the same match his brother Charles was a teammate on the left but neither brother appeared in the replay, when Wanderers beat them 3‚Äì0.Warsop. pp. 43-46.

He was also a cricketer and a member of the M.C.C.. Legal career and later life Thompson was called to the bar on 6 June 1872 and practised as a barrister on the North-Eastern Circuit, becoming a Q.C.. He died, aged forty-five, at his home in Marylebone, London, on 20 March 1894, three days after returning home from the West Coast of the United States where he wintered because of failing health over his last three years.

He founded St. Paul's Choir School in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1963, and served as the second president of the Church Music Association of America. Life and career Marier once said he \\"got hooked on chant\\" as a college student in the 1930s when he heard a 78 rpm recording of the choir of the Abbey of Solesmes, France. \\"It was the most beautiful music I had ever heard\\", he said. He later studied at Solesmes under Dom Joseph Gajard. A graduate of Boston College, he was director of band music there from 1934 to 1942. In 1940 he received a master's degree from Harvard, and over the course of the years he was also a choir director or lecturer at Emmanuel College, Newton College of the Sacred Heart, and Boston University. In 1934, Marier began fifty-two years of musical service at The Church of St. Paul (Harvard Square) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, first as organist and from 1947 as choir director. In 1963, with Monsignor Augustine F. Hickey, he founded a choir school associated with the parish, St. Paul's Choir School, and directed it until his retirement in 1986. The school later became known as the Boston Archdiocesan Choir School, and the choir, the Boston Boy Choir, though as of April 2014, the school's original name has been reestablished. In the 1950s, Marier was a faculty member of the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College. In that capacity, he contributed to editing The Pius X Hymnal (1953). In 1966 he was elected president of the Church Music Association of America, succeeding Rembert Weakland. After his 1986 retirement from St. Paul's, Marier became Justine Bayard Ward Professor and faculty adviser of the doctoral program in liturgical music and Director of the Center for Ward Studies at The Catholic University of America. He was also a member of the board of directors of the Institut f√ºr Hymnologische und Musikethnologische Studien, Maria Laach, Germany; and a fellow of the American Guild of Organists. Marier also studied at Cambridge University, England, and made recordings with the Boston Symphony under Seiji Ozawa. He edited two hymnals: Cantus Populi (1954) and Hymns, Psalms, and Spiritual Canticles (two editions, 1975 and 1983). Honors Marier received honorary doctorates in music from The Catholic University of America, the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music, Rome, and Saint Anselm College. In 1984, in recognition of his fifty years of service to Saint Paul's and the Catholic Church at large, Pope John Paul II named Marier a Knight Commander of Saint Gregory. He was invested by then-Archbishop Bernard Law at Saint Paul's. In December 1996, he received the Saint Ignatius Award from his alma mater, Boston College High School. Personal Theodore Marier was a good friend of French composer Jean Langlais. He was also a friend of the Benedictine Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut and assigned the copyright to his last book, A Gregorian Chant Master Class, to the Abbey. Legacy Cardinal Bernard Francis Law celebrated Marier's funeral Mass at The Church of St. Paul (Harvard Square) in Cambridge. In the 1950s Cardinal Law, while an undergraduate at Harvard, had sung under Marier's direction. \\"Professor Marier effectively transmitted his inspiration about Gregorian chant to generations of Catholic musicians\\", wrote Helen Hull Hitchcock, editor of the Adoremus Bulletin.

It was released on CD in February 2007 as part of his attempts to have a \\"Minor\\" hit single, preferably at #27 in the charts. The exploits of O'Doherty trying to have this \\"hit\\" was featured in an episode of his TV series, The Modest Adventures of David O'Doherty. The song was written and recorded by David O'Doherty, and was recorded onto standard CD-R discs using his own laptop to do so. His phone number was written on the back of the single's (also homemade) artwork so that if the people who bought it couldn't get it to play, they could contact him and he would play them the song over the phone. Song promotion Fewer than 312 singles were produced, as it usually only takes this number of single sales to enter the Irish Single Chart top 30. As such, the physical single is now a rare collector's item for fans of his. The song received limited airplay on the radio due to profanity in the lyrics towards the end of the song. However, O'Doherty showed up to various radio stations, such as Rick O'Shea's 2FM show, to perform a version of the single live in order to promote it. The single was launched at the branch of Oxfam on Parliament Street in Dublin. However, at the launch, people couldn't buy the single as it wouldn't register in the Singles chart. The CD was only available in two stores: Tower Records and Road Records, both in Dublin. Song content The song itself features a catchy, bouncy beat combined with a calmly sung verse and a drumming chorus. It tells the story about a man that works in a photocopy shop who makes his own badges. He has never had any luck with women and was too shy to ask any of them out on a date. At the same time, there is a woman who got fired from the Pizza parlour where she worked, as she was a militant Vegetarian and tried to make all the pizzas vegetarian too. She never got asked out either. She was a fan of Garfield and took a poster into the photocopy shop where the man was working. They struck up a conversation and arranged to go out to a pub on a date. However she turned up to the date wearing a lot of badly applied fake tan. Hence, she is \\"Orange\\" in colour. The man was seriously put off by this and wanted to end the date, but instead she leaves him when he orders a packet of Bacon Snacks because this goes against her beliefs as a vegetarian. The song ends with the man and woman realising that they weren't meant for each other after all. The song's lyrics reference many random orange items such as Garfield, Fanta, Tonka Trucks and the Oompa Loompas from the film, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Music video The music video features the story of the song being acted out, interspersed with scenes of O'Doherty singing in a white suit on a beach. On his TV show, he noted how the biggest selling Irish artists like Westlife, Boyzone or Johnny Logan, usually wore white suits in their music videos. In this way, he hoped to emulate their success. The part of the man is played by fellow Irish comedian Bernard O'Shea. The video can be seen on YouTube. The song famously ended with the man leaving and saying the line \\"that shit, that shit is fucking insane\\" (referring to her bad fake tan use). Chart performance The song reached #30 in the Irish singles charts. O'Doherty had been hoping it would reach #27, but this position was held by Jibbs's song \\"Chain Hang Low\\". He was still happy with his \\"success\\", as it meant he had a minor chart hit. The song is now considered a cult hit by O'Doherty's many fans.

The Khwae Yai River (, , ), also known as the Si Sawat ( ), is a river in western Thailand. It has its source in the Tenasserim Hills and flows for about through Sangkhla Buri, Si Sawat, and Mueang Districts of Kanchanaburi Province, where it merges with the Khwae Noi to form the Mae Klong River at Pak Phraek. In 1980, the Srinagarind Dam (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ô‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡πå; rtgs: Khuean Sinakharin) on the Khwae Yai was completed in Si Sawat District of Kanchanaburi Province. It is an embankment dam for river regulation and hydroelectric power generation. Bridge The famous bridge of the Burma Railway crosses the river at Tha Makham Subdistrict of the Mueang District. However, this is not the same bridge as depicted in The Bridge on the River Kwai by Pierre Boulle and in its film adaptation. A bridge was built of wood approximately upriver from the current bridge, during the construction of the iron and concrete bridge (which runs in a NNE-SSW direction) and also rebuilt in 1945 when the iron bridge was bombed. No remnants of the wooden bridge remain. That wooden bridge was also not the bridge depicted in the film as the river was not called the Kwai Yai at that time. A wooden trestle bridge was built over the Kwai Noi many miles upstream in the jungle and it would more closely resemble the bridge in the film. However, the film is really a fictional depiction of the events with many inaccuracies and neither bridge can really be said to be that depicted in the film. Up until the 1960s, the river was considered part of the Mae Klong itself, but this part of the Mae Klong was then renamed Khwae Yai to bring geographical fact more in line with the fictional association with the name River Kwai. The main cemetery of prisoners who died during the railway's construction is nearby and is called the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery.

Filmed in Brooksville, Florida, it was inspired by the W. W. Jacobs short story \\"The Monkey's Paw\\". Plot In Vietnam, American soldier Andy Brooks is shot by a sniper and falls to the ground. As he dies, he hears his mother's voice calling out, \\"Andy, you'll come back. You've got to. You promised.\\" The voice becomes sinister and muffled as Andy's eyes close. Sometime later, his family receives notice of his death in combat. Back home, Andy's father, Charles, and sister, Cathy, begin to grieve, but his mother, Christine, becomes irate and refuses to believe that Andy has died. Hours later, in the middle of the night, Andy arrives at the front door in full uniform and apparently unharmed; the family accepts the notice of his death as a clerical error and welcomes him back with joy. Over the next few days, Andy displays strange, withdrawn behavior, speaking only rarely, dressing in an unusually concealing manner, and spending his days sitting around the house listless and anemic. Meanwhile, local police investigate the murder of a local trucker, who was found with his throat slashed and his body drained of blood after telling diner patrons that he'd picked up a hitchhiking soldier. Charles attempts to confront Christine about Andy's erratic behavior, which causes tension between the couple. Christine insists that Charles was too withdrawn and authoritarian toward Andy; Charles counters that Christine made Andy too sensitive by smothering him. Andy continues to display unusual behavior: he attacks a neighbor boy who attempts to demonstrate his karate skills, then kills the family dog when it tries to protect the child. At night, Andy becomes inexplicably lively and animated, wandering the town and spending time in the local cemetery. Charles brings home a doctor and family friend, who offers Andy a checkup. He later tells Charles about the truck driver and says he needs to inform the police about the suspicious coincidence of Andy's return. Andy visits him in the middle of the night demanding a checkup, but the doctor can't detect a pulse or heartbeat. Andy tells him, \\"I died for you, Doc. Why shouldn't you return the favor?\\" He attacks and kills the doctor, then uses a syringe to inject the doctor's blood into his arm. It's clear that Andy is some kind of vampire or zombie who needs the blood of others to reinvigorate his decaying body. The next day, Charles becomes convinced his son is responsible for the deaths. When Christine tells him that Andy is on a double date with his high school sweetheart, Joanne, his sister and his best friend, Charles gets his gun and goes looking for them. At a drive-in cinema, Andy visibly decays due to lack of blood. He attacks and kills Joanne and his friend. The other patrons witness the attack. Andy flees before he can inject his victims' blood, running over and killing one of the patrons. Andy returns home, where his mother protects him from his father. Charles commits suicide when he sees what his son has become. As Christine is driving Andy away, he is shot at by police. They pursue him, and the chase ends at the graveyard where he had been spending his free time. They discover Andy's decayed corpse writhing in a shallow grave beneath a tombstone on which Andy himself had scrawled his own name and the dates of his birth and death. Christine sobs as she tries to cover the corpse with dirt. Cast Production Filming took place in Brooksville, Florida, in the fall of 1972, under the working title The Night Walker. Release Deathdream opened in Tampa, Florida on August 30, 1974. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Deathdream holds an approval rating of 83%, based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 6.72/10. Chuck Middlestat of the Albuquerque Journal deemed the film a \\"light-weight spooker that starts off pretty slowly but builds into a good nail-biter in the last half-hour,\\" but noted the dialogue as weak, adding that \\"the actors... do as well as they could with sophomoric lines.\\" Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk wrote, \\"The reason Deathdream works is its superior dramatic staging. The actors are excellent, especially John Marley and Lynn Carlin, both honored for their roles in John Cassavetes' Faces. Clark stages the domestic scenes with a fine simplicity and what we remember the most is the looks of bewilderment on nicely-framed faces.\\" Paul Corupe of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"Deathdream, the second collaboration by director Bob Clark and screenwriter Alan Ormsby, is a marked artistic and technical leap forward from the pair's overrated debut feature, Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things. A modern spin on the classic \\"be careful what you wish for\\" theme, Ormsby's screenplay balances a pointed Vietnam War allegory with pulpier aspects‚Äîa \\"shock\\" ending, distinct moments of morbid comic relief and beyond-the-grave retribution ripped from the pages of a 1950s horror comic.\\" In The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle wrote, \\"Though not very lively and ultimately anti-climactic, the movie sustains a calculated mood of off- centered awkwardness from start to finish, and is buttressed by strong acting and plausible dialogue.\\" Glenn Kay wrote in Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide that Deathdream is \\"one of [Clark's] creepiest and most thought-provoking works\\". Home media Blue Underground DVD released a special edition of Deathdream in 2004. Special features include an audio commentary by Bob Clark, an audio commentary by Alan Ormsby, the featurette Tom Savini: The Early Years, the featurette Deathdreaming: Interview with Star Richard Backus, alternate opening titles, extended ending sequence, trailers, and a poster and still gallery.

It is run under the joint trusteeship of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth and a religious order of teachers, the De La Salle Brothers. Former headteacher David Todd joined the school in 2013 and converted the school into an academy. The current headteacher is Mr Doyle. St Peter's has achieved both drama and sports specialist school status. The nearest Catholic church is Our Lady Queen of Peace and Blessed Margaret Pole. The Lower Primary School (Years reception‚Äì6) is on Holdenhurst Avenue, Iford; the Upper School (Years 7‚Äì13) is on St. Catherine's Road, Southbourne. The Upper School site includes the De La Salle Theatre, which seats 470 people.  History  Jesuits St Peter's was opened as a boys' boarding school on 29 September 1936 with 34 boys. Father Bellanti was the first headmaster and the school was run by Jesuit priests. The bedrooms were later removed, and the swimming pool was demolished due to building problems, now serving as the school's Sixth Form Centre after a refurbishment. De La Salle Brothers In the summer of 1947, the school was handed over to the De La Salle brothers. The last Jesuit community consisted of nine fathers and two brothers. One of the Jesuit priests who was a housemaster at St Peter's was Father Gerard Hughes S.J., the author of God of Surprise in which he observed St Peter's boys were \\"affable and undemanding\\". At the time of transition there were 145 boys in the school. Independent grammar school From the time of the first De La Salle headmaster, Brother Bernard Brady in 1947, until 1980, under Brother Bernard Hayward, St. Peters was a fee-paying independent grammar school that, together with Boscombe Convent School, served the Bournemouth area, particularly the Catholic community. During this time, the De La Salle brothers improved, enlarged and ran the school; thirty years later numbers had increased to nearly 800 pupils across the school from 8‚Äì18 years of age. In 1973 it sent nearly 14% of its graduating Sixth Form students to Oxford and Cambridge. Under the headmastership of Brother Alan Maurice, the school became a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) association of public schools. Boaters were allowed to be worn by Sixth Form students, and boarders wore grey suits instead of the normal weekday blue on Sundays when going to Mass and Benediction. From 1970 girls wishing to follow a mainly science-based course of study were admitted to A Level, beginning the trend towards co-educational teaching in the school. After the reorganisation of local education and the changes made by the Labour government in 1974, the St Peter's, St Thomas More and Boscombe Convent schools were combined and integrated, with a notice of intent published on 13 October 1978, followed in 1980 by the merging of Boscombe Convent and St Thomas More, and all schools combined in one site with the name of St Peter's by 1986. Comprehensive In 1992, the Brothers withdrew from the day-to-day running of the school, though remaining trustees, and the first headmaster who was not a member of a religious order, Anthony McCaffrey, was appointed. He retired at the end of the 2011 academic year after 19 years of leadership of St Peter's. Arts and Sports College status St. Peter's School gained Arts College status in September 2000, and in September 2004 gained dual specialist status in Arts and Sport. As an Arts College St Peter's was shortlisted, but not selected, for the 2008 Sky1 TV programme Hairspray: The School Musical, with students being interviewed and auditioned. Academy status The school was granted Academy status at the beginning of September 2011. Martyn Egan led the school throughout its first year as an academy. David Todd became headteacher in September 2012 and resigned in August 2019, replaced in an acting capacity by Ben Doyle From 1 September 2014 St Peter's became an \\"all-through\\" school, with the establishment of two Reception classes at the Iford site. In September 2016, Years 7 and 8 joined the main site at Southbourne, leaving the Iford site for the sole use of the primary school.

The school was built adjacent to Hengistbury Airfield where Rolls had a fatal accident in July 1910. A large air show was taking place as part of Bournemouth's centenary celebrations; Rolls' aeroplane crashed, the first air accident death in England. In 2010, St Peter's marked the centenary of the death of Charles Rolls by having a fair on the Headmaster's Lawn at the Southbourne site. The memorial was also refurbished. The Central Band of the RAF performed in the school hall and there was an exhibition of Rolls-Royce aviation memorabilia, including an aero-engine.

World War II Transfer to the Pacific Theatre  With shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, the new large infantry landing craft departed Key West, Florida, on 12 November for the Pacific, transited the Panama Canal on the 19th, and arrived San Diego, California, on 1 December. There she joined LCI Group 57, sailed for Hawaii on 29 January 1945, and arrived Pearl Harbor on 7 February. LCI(L)-869 got underway for the war zone on the 15th, refueled at Johnston Island five days later, and reached the Palaus, via Majuro, Kwajalein, Eniwetok, and Guam, on 7 April. There she joined a picket line which had been formed to seal off by-passed Japanese-held islands in the area from reinforcements and to protect American bases from invasion. While on picket station, LCI(L)-869 repulsed a suicide swimming attack, sank several floating mines which threatened American ships, and heard countless mortar shells whined overhead. On the afternoon of 2 September, the Japanese forces in the Palaus surrendered.  Mission complete  With her mission accomplished, LCI(L)-869 returned to the United States, decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, in March 1947, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. The landing craft was renamed USS Goldcrest and redesignated AMc(U)-24 on 7 March 1952. USS Goldcrest was converted to a minehunter at the Charleston Navy Yard, assigned to the 6th Naval District, and operated out of Key West, Florida.

Her career includes acting, writing, translating, directing and adaptations into English from Norwegian texts.  Early career  Anna Gutto started her dedication to acting and story-telling through the theater already as a child. Not letting herself be sidelined by the largest roles being for men, she spent her childhood years playing several male characters. Committed to a professional life in the theater, she went from school and community theater to the performing arts high school Hartvig Nissen in Oslo. She made her professional debut in 1997 when director Stein Winge, artistic director Svein Sturla Hungnes and set designer John-Kristian Alsaker chose her to play Solveig in Peer Gynt at the Riksteatret (The Norwegian State Theater) after fierce competition. She later received a two- year contract at \\"Teatret V√•rt\\" in Molde, where she played roles such as Lady Anne in Richard III, Bianca in The Taming of the Shrew, Nerissa in The Merchant of Venice, and Maja in Prinsen og pryleguten. There, together with Carl Morten Amundsen, she also created the one-woman performance Fidel's Island for the 2000 Molde International Jazz Festival. She has worked with award-winning Scandinavian theater artists such as Bj√∏rn Sundquist, Hilda Hellwiig, Yngve Sundvor, Sven Nordin, Jan Gr√∏nli, and Sossen Krogh, among others. During her time in Molde she was also artistic director for the independent production of The Lover by Harold Pinter.  Worked with Jon Fosse  Anna's work has particularly pinpointed the development of translation and adaptation as an important part of cultural enhancement. Ms Gutto was instrumental in bringing Norway‚Äôs most prominent contemporary playwright, Jon Fosse, to the United States. Fosse's plays have been staged all over the world, but it was not until 2004 with Anna's theater company Oslo Elsewhere's production of Night Sings Its Songs that the American audience experienced how this internationally renowned playwright has influenced modern theater. In 2006 Anna Gutto was also instrumental in bringing a contemporary adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm to New York, allowing New Yorkers to take part in the 2006 international centennial celebrations of one of the world‚Äôs most- produced playwrights.  New York  Her first theatrical creation in New York was Pissing in the Wind, which she co-wrote and directed for the 2002 New York International Fringe Festival. She did seven productions in the following years and in 2005 portrayed Simone in the production of The Workroom at Manhattan Theatre Source. The production was later invited by the French Embassy to be part of the Act French Festival in New York City 2005. She was last seen as Rebecca West in Rosmersholm at 59E59 Theaters in New York. Other acting credits include The Young Woman in the US-premiere of Jon Fosse's Night Sings Its Songs, Boys' Life, After the Fall, Under Milk Wood, Game of Patience, and The Physics Project.  Film and Television  She co-directed the Netflix Original series \\"Home for Christmas\\" in the spring of 2019. She directed her first short film \\"The Kangaroo\\" (winner, best mixed media short, Los Angeles International Family Film Festival) in 2010. Her following films are \\"Leila M.\\" (short, 2012), \\"Miss Them When I'm on the Road\\" (short, 2012), Don't Tell Anyone (short, 2015) and \\"Mommy Heist\\" (short, 2016). She is slated to direct the feature film adaptation of the New York Times bestseller \\"Radical Remission\\" (Kelly Turner, 2014). She has performed in a variety of films. In Gone With the Woman (Tatt av kvinnen), she acts alongside Peter Stormare. The film is directed by Petter N√¶ss (nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film for Elling in 2002). Her other film credits include Millennium Crisis, Poise, Anniversary, Exercises in Separation, Family Reunion, Rebecca. Liliana and \\"InContact\\".  Essays/written works  Miss Gutto‚Äôs essays on theatrical work, across borders and the art of translation and adaptation from one country to another, have been published in industry publications such as Stikkordet, the magazine of the Norwegian Actors' Equity Association, as well as Kunnskapsforlaget's book Ibsens kvinner (Ibsen's Women), for which Norway's former Minister of Culture Ellen Horn was editor. Her essays focus on the art of translation and adaptation beyond the linguistic challenges. Her essay from Ibsen's Women describes her intentions, process, and development of the adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm for a contemporary American audience. Miss Gutto has also worked as translator/adaptor on plays such as Water by Sheila Callaghan, The Lover by Harold Pinter and Rosmersholm by Henrik Ibsen. For the latter she worked in collaboration with American playwright Bridgette Wimberly and Norwegian dramaturge Oda Radoor.  Plays  Miss Gutto's plays include: Tid, Fidel's Island (co-created with Carl Morten Amundsen) and Pissing in the Wind. She is currently developing the new play IN SECURITY, where one can follow an accomplished doctor as she comes face-to-face with a choice that will affect the rest of her life. IN SECURITY is a comedic ripping view of a successful woman and her fear of commitment. It presents the insecurity at the core of human nature: the fear of losing oneself.  Oslo Elsewhere  Anna Gutto was co-artistic director of Oslo Elsewhere, a theater company she founded with Norwegian-American director Sarah Cameron Sunde in 2004, which is dedicated to the development of idiomatic translations and bridging the gap between contemporary Norwegian and American theater. After the run of the company's production of Night Sings Its Songs in 2004, Anna and Sarah were commissioned to create a performance for T.M. King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway for their New York visit in February 2005 entitled Variations on a Theme. This performance event was created to celebrate the 100th anniversary since the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden. The performance was a celebration of this peaceful separation, mixed with the stories of Norwegian immigrants to the US and performances of Norwegian artists living in New York. Ms Gutto's next project with Oslo Elsewhere was IBSEN+FOSSE2006, a double bill presentation of Henrik Ibsen's Rosmersholm alongside Jon Fosse's deathvariations at 59E59 Theaters in New York City the summer of 2006.

The qualification is recognized by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is often used to grant acceptance in any Italian university or higher education institution in Italy. Origins The origins of the modern CILS qualification are said to date back to 1588 when the Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinand I created a school for learning of the then Tuscan Italian language for German students. Subsequent movements for the dissemination of the Italian language and Italian culture have also been established and promoted throughout history. The Foreigners University of Siena embodies the role nowadays for the official creation, distribution, and awarding of the CILS qualification. Structure The qualification is officially issued on successful completion of a particular level, conforming with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages of the European Council. Therefore six levels of increasing difficulty are represented by the examinations involved to obtain the certificate. The beginner level examination starts at level A1 whilst the most advanced level is C2. As such the qualification resembles the DELF/DALF used for recognizing French language ability. This said, however, the qualification is often seen as comprising four levels (from CILS Uno to CILS Quattro, B1 to C2 according to the European Framework) as the Italian required becomes more advanced. All examinations cover what are viewed as the most important elements in language acquisition: speaking, reading, written composition, analysis of structures of communication, and listening. Levels CILS Uno The first (B1) of the more advanced levels requires the passing of a three-hour-long examination, testing an applicant's knowledge of basic Italian. CILS Due The second level (B2) features a four-hour-long examination with an advancement of difficulty. This level is considered as recognizing an applicant's sustained ability to adequately converse in Italian and is the level from which one may apply for entrance to an Italian university without sitting the normally obligatory language assessment. CILS Tre The third level (C1) is again another advancement in difficulty and represents a high competence in speaking Italian. An applicant must pass a five-hour-long examination to receive this level of qualification. CILS Quattro The fourth level (C2) is the highest level of the CILS qualifications. Upon successful completion of the five-and- a-half-hour-long examination of this level an applicant is regarded as having reached a point of language mastery, almost akin to that of a native. Eligibility CILS qualification is open to all Italian residents abroad and non-Italian speakers wishing to validate their skills in Italian. Applicants of any age are eligible to apply. Preparation for the examination is highly encouraged. Procedure To sit the examination, applicants must pay for registration (prices varying between countries) and then sit it at any certified examination centre. When an exam has been completed, the University for Foreigners of Siena evaluates the result, following the guidelines of the European Union, awarding the appropriate level of qualification when an applicant scores the required minimum pass mark or above. The examinations traditionally take place in June and December of every year. Many centres around the world, including the University for Foreigners of Siena, organize preparatory lessons and guides to best prepare students for the rigours of the exams.

First she married to a nobleman despite her desire to become a nun though she and her husband both desired the religious life; the couple bore nine children but she and her children fled after Napoleon invaded the nation to which her husband remained to fight as a volunteer and later died leaving her widowed but free to pursue her religious inclinations. Her canonization as a saint was celebrated on 12 April 1959. Life Joaquima Vedruna Vidal de Mas was born on 16 April 1783 in Barcelona to the nobles Lorenzo de Vedruna - who worked for the government - and Teresa Vidal; her baptism was celebrated on the date of her birth in the parish church of Santa Maria del Pi. In 1795 she expressed a desire to become a Carmelite nun but her parents believed she was not mature enough to make such a decision. Her childhood was a pious one and she fostered a special devotion to the Infant Jesus while being known for her obsessive cleanliness and she made her First Communion in 1792. On 24 March 1799 she married the barrister and landowner Teodoro de Mas (the firstborn of his own household) with whom she had nine children; both husband and wife later became members of the Third Order of Saint Francis and she became known as \\"Joaquina of Saint Francis of Assisi\\". Her husband was a friend of her father and was undecided about which of Lorenzo's three daughters to wed: he gave the three a box of almonds and the two older girls rejected it as a childish gift but she accepted and said: \\"I love almonds\\" and thus he settled on her. But Napoleon's invasion saw her flee with her children but her husband insisted that he remain to fight as a volunteer and he died on 6 March 1816; she moved with her children after a few months from Barcelona to their estate of \\"Manso Escorial\\" in Vic and she began to wear the habit of the third order on a frequent basis. Here she began her charitable activities with the sick and with women. Her spiritual director - the Capuchin Esteban de Olot - suggested she establish an apostolic congregation devoted to education and to charitable works. Four daughters entered convents and two sons married while three others died as children. The Bishop of Vic Pablo Jes√∫s Corcuera told her the institute should be of a Carmelite inspiration; she made her vows to the bishop on 6 January 1826. The same bishop wrote the rule for the order on 6 February 1826 and on the morning of 26 February she and another eight women professed their vows while she founded the order at that moment. That morning the group attended Mass at a Capuchin church and then went to her estate to begin their new order. But she also collaborated with Anthony Mary Claret for the writing up of the rule. During the First Carlist War she had to flee from Spain because she had founded a hospital in the Carlist town of Berga that was threatened due to all of the fighting and so she went to Roussillon in France and was there from 1836 until 1842. Her congregation received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius IX on 5 August 1857 while the order was aggregated to the mainstream Carmelites on 14 September 1860; official papal approval came on 20 July 1880 from Pope Leo XIII. In spite of serious challenges that the civil war and secular opposition posed the institute she founded soon spread into Catalonia. Thereafter communities were established throughout Spain and Hispanic America. In due course she was forced to resign as the Superior of her order due to sickness; she died during a cholera epidemic in Barcelona on 28 August 1854 but she fell victim to paralysis since 1850. Her first attack of apoplexy came in September 1849 with more following. Her remains are in the order's motherhouse in Vic. Her order now operates in nations such as Japan and Eritrea while in 2008 there were 2012 religious in 280 houses. Sainthood incorrupt. The sainthood cause commenced under Pope Benedict XV on 14 January 1920 in a move that titled her as a Servant of God while the confirmation of her model life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Pius XI to title her as Venerable on 16 June 1935. The confirmation of two miracles attributed to her intercession saw Pope Pius XII preside over her beatification on 19 May 1940 and the confirmation of another two allowed for Pope John XXIII to canonize her on 12 April 1959 in Saint Peter's Basilica.

Retrieved 10 April 2020. is a British novelist, essayist and travel writer. Biography Welsh by family, with Scandinavian ancestry, Kavenna was born in Leicester and spent her childhood in Suffolk and the Midlands as well as various other parts of Britain. She has also lived in the United States, France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Baltic States.Author's official website These travels led to her first book, The Ice Museum, which was published in 2005. It was nominated for the Guardian First Book Award in that year, and the Ondaatje Prize, and the Dolman Best Travel Book Award in 2006. Described by The New York Review of Books as \\"illuminating and consequential,\\"Brad Leithauser in the New York Review of Books it combines history, travel, literary criticism and first-person narrative, as the author journeys through Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Baltic and Greenland. Along the way, Kavenna investigates various myths and travellers' yarns about the northerly regions, focusing particularly on the ancient Greek story of Thule, the last land in the North. Before The Ice Museum she had written several novels that remain unpublished. Kavenna studied at Linacre College, Oxford, and has held writing fellowships at St Antony's College, Oxford and St John's College, Cambridge. She was the writer-in-residence at St Peter's College, Oxford for a time. Themes of the country versus the city, the relationship between self and place, and the plight of the individual in hyper-capitalist society recur through both Kavenna's novels and in some of her journalism. She has written for The New Yorker, The Huffington Post, The London Review of Books, The Guardian, The Observer, The International Herald Tribune and The New York Times, among other publications. She is now based in the Duddon Valley, Cumbria and has a partner and two young children.Interview in the Guardian. In 2013 she was included in the Granta list of 20 best young writers. Novels Her first published novel, Inglorious, which appeared in 2007, alludes to classics of urban dislocation such as Knut Hamsun's Hunger, Robert Musil's The Man Without Qualities and Saul Bellow's Herzog.Books guardian.co.uk It was shortlisted for the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize in 2007 and won the Orange Broadband Award for New Writers.Joanna Kavenna's Inglorious wins Orange new writers award 2008 |Books |guardian.co.uk Her second novel, The Birth of Love (2010) turns to ideas of power and childbirth and the nature of reality, portraying three characters in three periods of history, whose lives are wholly altered by their experiences of childbirth. Questions about the relationship between technology and nature run through the novel; also the permeable boundaries between reality and fantasy. The first, historical strand is based on the real-life Hungarian-born Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, a doctor working in 19th-century Vienna, who realised that the spread of child-bed or puerperal fever could be prevented if doctors would wash their hands between patients. His theories were generally ignored, and he died in an asylum.Puerperal fever Kavenna turns a real-life history into an extract from a (fictional) Gothic novel, in which Semmelweis is visited by an invented character, Robert von Lucius, who begins as a sceptic like the other doctors, but comes to believe Semmelweis. In the second strand, in a recognisable present-day London, a woman called Brigid goes into labour with her second child. Meanwhile, in the third strand, also set in London today, a writer publishes his Gothic novel about Ignaz Semmelweis. In the fourth strand, set in a dystopian future, a prisoner and her captor argue about eugenics and the control of women's bodies. It gradually becomes clear that this society has taken to forcibly sterilising women after an environmental apocalypse, to control population numbers and demands on depleted resources. A group of dissidents has been uncovered, who hid a pregnant woman so that she could give birth naturally. This section clearly pastiches a tradition of dystopian dialogue, from William Morris through H G Wells, to Marge Piercy, as well as the classic sci-fi interrogation scene. The Birth of Love is structured as a quartet. Kavenna draws all her strands together in a climactic final section, in which birth is shown to be a moment in which past, present and future merge. Kavenna has suggested that she wanted to write an \\"epic\\" about childbirth, emphasising its central role in the lives of both men and women.Kavenna talks about her new novel |Books |guardian.co.uk It was long- listed for the Orange Prize 2011.Orange Prize for Fiction. Writing about this novel in The Observer, Rachel Cusk said that the novel is not always \\"tasteful\\" but is ultimately \\"uninhibitedly truthful...daring...and brilliant\\".Rachel Cusk in the Observer Kavenna's third novel, Come to the Edge (2012) is a satire, set in a fictionalised version of the Duddon Valley, Cumbria. Kavenna has explained that: \\"It's about what happens when you push people too far, when you keep whacking them with one injustice after another ‚Äì when society gets too plainly iniquitous, and how finally they crack.\\" Female First The novel tells of the surreal events that transpire when the narrator, at a loss in life, answers an advert to be a lodger and farm worker on a remote farm in the Lake District. She goes to the Lakes expecting some usual variation on the reviving and consoling country retreat, but she arrives and discovers the widowed farmer she will be living with, Cassandra White, is a paranoid survivalist and renegade philosopher with all sorts of theories about society, along with strong views on the evils of grain and the vices of \\"perverts\\" ‚Äì Cassandra's term for the rich. The valley is a place of notable contrasts: between the poor who can barely afford to stay in their homes in the Valley, and the rich who buy up second homes and hardly use them. Goaded by a sense of riotous injustice and convinced that wider society cares little about the rural poor, Cassandra and the narrator develop a \\"resettlement scheme\\" ‚Äì to resettle the poor in the empty houses of the rich. The novel is a dark comedy, yet it also makes a serious point throughout, about the iniquities of hyper-consumerist society and the free market notion of ceaseless growth as an inevitable good.Female First Kavenna wrote the book five years ago while living in the Duddon Valley and has said that it took a while to find the right editor for it.Books |guardian.co.uk Kavenna has also suggested that the novel riffs on the old relationship of the prophet/sage and an interpreter, or the fabulous freak and a less charismatic companion: a venerable tradition from Plato and Socrates through the Romantics, which also forms the basis of such novels as Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisitedand Jack Kerouac's On the Road.Interview on Woman's Hour Kavenna's fourth novel, A Field Guide to Reality (2016) imagines a parallel version of Oxford, where a professor has created a \\"manual for fixing existential angst;\\"Interview in the Observer a vast compendium of philosophical thought through the ages. This is the Field Guide to Reality of the title. However, the manual has gone missing and all the characters are trying to find it, for various reasons. Throughout the book, Kavenna considers recurring philosophical questions about the nature of reality and truth.BBC Free Thinking Stuart Kelly in The Scotsman described it as a novel that \\"deals with the nature of light and enlightenment, quantum physics and strange attractors, grieving and gifting.... There is a very English kind of surrealism at play.\\"Review in the Scotsman In The Spectator, Sam Byers argued for it as a \\"work of cunning misdirection and trickery ‚Äì a mystery in thrall to mystery's beauty.\\"Review in the Spectator The Guardian, referring to \\"Joanna Kavenna's varied and prodigious output\\", argued that this \\"unusual novel... delighted and confounded the critics.\\"Guardian Books Roundup It is illustrated by the English songwriter, artist and filmmaker Oly Ralfe, of the Ralfe Band, who also worked with the Mighty Boosh. Kavenna has suggested that the novel was partly inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges story \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\", and by contemporary debates about theories of everything.BBC Start the Week References Bibliography * 2005: The Ice Museum: In Search of the Lost Land of Thule, London, Penguin. * 2007: Inglorious, London, Faber. * 2010: The Birth of Love, London, Faber. * 2012: Come to the Edge, London, Quercus. * 2014: Essays on the Self, London, Notting Hill Editions. * 2016: Alchemy, London, Notting Hill Editions. * 2016: A Field Guide to Reality, London, Quercus. *2019: Zed, London, Faber.

The Shams and Nobovar Chanorov are known as Beatles of Tajiks. Created in 1995, Shams is today one of the best groups of Rock and Roll in Tajikistan. This group of 7 musicians between 25 and 40 years, originating in Pamir, is the most known group since their first concert in Almaty. A month before the peace agreement of civil war was signed in Tajikistan, the group has returned to Dushanbe. The musicians of the group change regularly and Shams of today is known especially thanks to its singer Nobovar Chanorov and his guitarist Iqbol Zavqibekov. Up to now the group has produced 4 albums. Shams is also known in Afghanistan, in Uzbekistan, in Russia and in Europe. Life and Education Nobovar was born in Komsomolobod in the Rasht valley of Tajikistan. His parents are originally from Dehrushan village of Rushan District of Gorno- Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast, in the Pamirs. Himself being a Rushani speaker (one of the many Pamiri languages), he sings mostly in Tajiki and Rushani. However, he sings individual songs in Spanish, English and Russian. Nobovar has spent his childhood and schooling years in the home village of his parents - Dehrushan. He started his singing from early years. As part of his family tradition, he started playing rubab (the traditional local musical instrument) and accordion and singing maddoh (traditional motives for prays of god) and pop-songs. His father, seeing his talent, gave him to the local musical school which he attended after his formal school at certain days of the week. As most of his youth days were spent playing different musical instruments and singing different types of traditional and pop-songs, this took him to the doors of the Institute of Arts in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. However, he graduated as an actor of drama rather than singer or musician. Nevertheless, he has maintained his commitment to and love of singing. The band \\"Shams\\" of which Nobovar is the lead singer has celebrated their 10th anniversary in Kokhi Borbad in Dushanbe in early 2010. \\"Shams\\" is known through Nobovar though there are talented musicians in the band some of whom went for professional development trips abroad. Today, Nobovar is one of the elite musicians of Tajikistan and arguably the best singer of the Pamirs in his own right and style.

Background Owned by Colonel Edward R. Bradley and foaled at his renowned Idle Hour Stock Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, Burgoo King was named for a local grocer famous for his burgoo stew. Out of the mare Minawand, he was sired by Bradley's 1926 Kentucky Derby winner, Bubbling Over. Burgoo King was trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee \\"Derby Dick\\" Thompson. Racing career 1931: two-year-old season Although he won four of his twelve starts in 1931, Burgoo King's best result in several major races for American two-year-olds was a third- place finish in the Pimlico Futurity. 1932: three-year-old season At age three, Burgoo King was unplaced in the Withers Stakes and for the Kentucky Derby was not considered a significant contender. He was sent off at betting odds of close to 6:1 behind the favored Hopeful Stakes winner Tick On. The colt was ridden by 19-year-old Eugene James, an up-and-coming jockey from Louisville, Kentucky, whom TIME magazine said had \\"made a sensation\\" in his 1931 racing season. Nonetheless, at the time, Col. Bradley's top jockey was Laverne Fator, who had first choice of any of Idle Hour's horses. Fator chose to ride the colt Brother Joe, leaving the lightly regarded Burgoo King for young James. The 1932 Kentucky Derby had a field of twenty starters, but Burgoo King got away cleanly. Shortly into the race stablemate Brother Joe pulled up lame. Although Burgoo King raced two wide with another horse behind the frontrunner, he made a strong move on the backstretch to take the lead and in the homestretch pulled away to win easily by three lengths. For Col. Bradley, it marked a record third Kentucky Derby win. Derby favorite Tick On finished sixth but in the ensuing Preakness Stakes he provided fierce competition with Burgoo King and jockey Eugene James beating Tick On by a head. Tragically, a year after his two Classic wins, James would die in a drowning accident in Lake Michigan. Winning the 1932 Belmont Stakes would have made Burgoo King the third U.S. Triple Crown champion in history. Two years earlier, the term \\"Triple Crown\\" had been coined by a sportswriter amid the hoopla surrounding Gallant Fox. The 1932 Belmont was run on June 4 but it has been reported that the colt was not eligible due to a failure on the part of his handlers to file all of the required paperwork. However, according to other sources, he twisted an ankle before the race and could not run. Another source claims that on June 11, while training for the American Derby in Chicago, Burgoo King bowed a tendon and would not race again for almost two years. That Burgoo King did not race from around mid-1932 until mid-1934 is a fact, but the National Sporting Library's Thoroughbred Heritage website says that he was referred to as being \\"far from robust\\" by turf writers. As such, he may have had a minor ankle injury that kept him out of the Belmont but would have healed enough in time for the American Derby a week later. Or, his handlers may simply have chosen not to risk injuring the suddenly valuable colt over the Belmont's 1¬Ω mile distance, the longest and most grueling of the Triple Crown races. Instead, they may have opted to go to the then-very prestigious American Derby, which was run at the Kentucky Derby distance of 1¬º miles. Two years later the handlers for 1934 Kentucky Derby winner Cavalcade, who lost the Preakness by a nose, chose to skip the Belmont and compete in the American Derby instead. Later racing career Burgoo King's injury was a serious one and he did not return to racing until May 1934. At a time when more than one organization selected annual thoroughbred champions, despite his shortened campaign, Burgoo King still shared U.S. Three-Year-Old Co-Champion honors with Faireno. As a five-year-old horse in 1934, he returned to have a successful campaign in minor races, winning two of his five starts, along with one second-place finish and a third in each of his other two races. Stud record Retired to Idle Hour Stock Farm, Burgoo King met with modest success at stud. Although none of his progeny achieved his race or earnings success, he did produce six stakes race winners. Burgoo King was eventually sent to Darby Dan Farm in Columbus, Ohio, where he died in 1946. He is buried there in the farm's equine cemetery.

She is portrayed by Amy Brenneman.Private Practice at The Futon Critic  Story-lines   Season One  Violet is a psychiatrist at the Oceanside Wellness Centre. Though she tells her patients that \\"happiness can be attained with focus\\", she fails to find any happiness in her own life and she even questions the usefulness of her chosen profession. Six months previously, her boyfriend Allan had ended their romantic relationship, devastating her. The situation was made worse when she ran into Allan in a supermarket, only to discover that he married a younger woman only a few months after their break-up. This has shaken Violet badly and she continues to telephone Allan as she tries to deal with their dissolved relationship. Violet is highly offended by women who lie about being raped. In a conversation with Dell Parker, she confirms that she was raped during her junior year of college and her best friend in college helped her get through it. In Episode 4.08 (\\"What Happens Next\\"), Violet also reveals this experience to Charlotte (after Charlotte's own rape). Violet is best friends with her co-worker, Cooper Freedman, often getting him out of humiliating situations with women. Violet also attended the University of Oregon, pursuing medicine at Harvard Medical School. She is a member of the American Psychiatric Association and the American College of Psychiatrists.  Season Two  More recently, Violet has had relationships with both her co-worker Peter Wilder and Sheldon, a psychiatrist working for \\"the enemy\\", the fourth floor. After choosing to stay with Sheldon, she discovers that she is pregnant but is unsure who the father is. At first, she keeps this information to herself, as she fears her abilities as a potential mother. In a moment of confidence, she tells one of her patients this and afterwards confides in Cooper. Cooper willingly moves in with her to help her get through it and encourages her to see Addison about the baby. During a conversation with Dell, she experiences some cramping and admits to him that she is pregnant. He performs an ultrasound to make sure there are no problems and after seeing the baby's heartbeat for the first time, Violet has a panic attack. Dell then convinces her to tell both Sheldon and Pete about the situation. Gathering them both in her office, she tells them they are not responsible for this and she says she knows that neither of them want children. Sheldon and Pete, both shocked, are instantly angry that she didn't tell them sooner and that she assumes they wouldn't want to be a part of the child's life, depending on who the father is. Pete then bluntly asks if this conversation means she's keeping the baby. Pausing, Violet admits that yes she will be raising the child, which up until that point was undecided. Later on, Sheldon proposes to Violet. In the Season 2 finale, Pete confronts Violet and says that he loves her and wants them to try as a family. She turns him down, but later kisses Pete and tells him she loves him too. Also in the Season 2 finale cliffhanger, Violet is drugged and trapped in her home by Katie, a mentally ill former patient who is convinced that Violet has her baby. Earlier in the episode, Violet thinks that Katie is off her psychiatric medications as Katie, who recently experienced a miscarriage, is almost euphoric about Violet's pregnancy. In the end, Katie blames Violet for her own unsuccessful pregnancy and is determined to hold Violet hostage until she gives her the baby. However, Katie begins to follow instructions for a caesarian section from a textbook, claiming she cannot wait for a normal delivery since she knows she will be arrested. Violet begins to instruct Katie on the C-section to save the baby's life, since she fears she cannot save her own. The season ends with Katie preparing to cut into Violet's belly.  Season Three  At the beginning of Season 3, Pete and Naomi find Violet barely alive in a pool of blood, with her baby gone. She's rushed to the hospital where Naomi and Addison work frantically to save her life. While waiting, Pete and Sheldon argue over the fact that Violet knew something was wrong with Katie and they didn't believe her. Meanwhile, Katie shows up at the hospital with Violet's baby and Pete and Cooper convince her to let them make sure the baby is all right. She relents and they take the baby and she is arrested. Addison works to save the baby while Naomi works to save Violet. In the end both surgeries are a success and Violet later awakens, asking for her baby. A month after being rescued, Violet is still trying to recover from her trauma. Pete lives with her and takes care of her and baby Lucas. Violet won't leave her house and has panic attacks every time the doorbell rings. After getting advice from Sheldon, Pete decides to move out, to help Violet recover and push her to go outside. Violet realizes that after dramatic events in her life she can't bond with her baby and gives Lucas to Pete, asking him to take care of the baby. Sheldon then files a paternity suit but the results reveal that Pete is the baby's father. Later during Katie Kent's trial, Violet lets Katie off by saying she was delusional during the attack which further agitates Pete. When Violet sleeps with Addison's father, Pete gives up on her. Violet refuses to have anything to do with Lucas at all and eventually runs off on vacation with Cooper. When Cooper returns, Violet is not with him. It isn't until much later Violet returns, obviously more calm and sane. While gone she spent time in New York working through her issues with a therapist and has come home to try to be a mother to Lucas. When Violet returns, she finds Pete in a relationship with Addison, something that causes her much pain. She tells Pete she wants shared custody, which he staunchly refuses. They get into a court battle in which everyone, including Cooper, says that she is unfit to share parenting duties completely. She confesses that she's still in love with Pete. Even though the judge rules in favor of Pete, he agrees to slowly start introducing Violet to co-parenting Lucas. In the season 3 finale, Addison tells Pete he should be with Violet and they once again resume a relationship.  Season Four  In the Season 4 premiere Pete pops the question after a morning of passion. Later the same day Violet announces to their friends that she and Pete are getting married...that following weekend. She asks Cooper to be her maid of honor, but his objective side meddles to such a degree that seeds of doubt are planted in Violet's head and she proceeds to bolt from the ceremony. Pete follows her and without saying a word, he convinces her to take a leap of faith and the two finally get married. Violet later discovers that she is being sued by former patient Katie Kent and in the season four finale she gets her license suspended. Against Pete's wishes, she decides to leave town on a book tour.  Season Five  After Pete has a heart attack, Violet is nowhere to be found because she's at the airport and inadvertently counsels a woman in an abusive relationship. She returns to the hospital after learning about Pete's heart attack. During his recovery, he verbally abuses and berates Violet constantly, as she tries to get back into the practice and have her license reinstated. She soon tells Pete she will not be his punching bag. She also knows he's struggling as it's a sign and pattern. Violet begins to feel as though Pete hates her. When she begins work on a probationary period, Sheldon lets the past interfere but Pete forces him to rethink his issues and Sheldon apologizes. Violet realizes Pete is trying. Trying doesn't work and both begin to feel that the marriage isn't working. Violet turns to Addison and the two become friends and companions much to the annoyance of Pete and Sam. While talking with Sam and Addison about their relationship, she has an epiphany about her marriage with Pete and after some discussion, the two decide to separate.  Season Six  In the season premi√©re Violet is left wondering where Pete is as his court date has arrived and he's not there. Throughout the episode Violet and the rest of the practice debate whether he has fallen into some trouble or he decided to make a run for it. The only clue available is a text message from Pete to Violet stating, \\"No matter what happens, know that I love you. I'm out on a run\\". Speculation flies as Violet considers whether Pete meant a jog or a flight out of the country. In the last minutes of the episode it is revealed by Violet in a conversation with Cooper that police have informed her Pete had fallen off a hill while on a run and suffered a fatal heart attack. Because he was out of immediate sight, help couldn't arrive in time and he died. Violet is in shock, stating she could hardly believe it was Pete and she didn't know how to break the news to their three-year-old son. As per Pete's will, Violet throws a party rather than a funeral, having a difficult time dealing with people talking about how Pete helped them and getting high on pot in the bathroom. She tries to sing, but ends up breaking down, screaming over how he could leave them. In the final episode, after Addison's wedding, she publishes her second book called \\"Private Practice\\" which is about life and joy. Reception Robert Bianco for USA Today has praised Brenneman's talent in the role of Violet, but has opined that she is \\"incredibly badly used\\". Variety's Cynthia Littleton has noted that Brenneman as Violet is the most intriguing of the show's supporting ensemble, both as an actor and a character.

It took its name from the location of its offices at the Royal Exchange, London. Origins The Royal Exchange Assurance emerged from a joint stock insurance enterprise known as Onslow's insurance or Onslow's Bubble. This had been begun as the Mercer's Hall Marine Company, or Undertaking kept at the Royal Exchange for insuring ships and merchandise at sea. A similar enterprise sought incorporation in 1718, but the Attorney- General reported against this. Lord Onslow then sought a means of avoiding the difficulty by his company acquiring the charters of Society of Mines Royal and Company of Mineral and Battery Works, which declared itself open for assuring ships and merchandise in March 1719. Their opponents petitioned against this and the Attorney-General reported in May 1719 that the use made of the charters was \\"unwarrantable\\". The directors admitted this mistake but requested their own charter in January 1720. They and another insurance enterprise each offered ¬£300,000 towards the king's Civil List debts. The king then encouraged the House of Commons to permit their incorporation. This was done in the Bubble Act. The new chartered company then accepted subscriptions paid on shares in the old company in payment for those on its own shares.W. R. Scott, The Constitution and Finance of ... Joint-Stock Companies to 1720 (Cambridge University Press, 1911) III, 396-409. Chartered company The company received its royal charter under the Royal Exchange and London Assurance Corporation Act 1719, popularly known as the Bubble Act. Under the terms of this legislation, the Royal Exchange and the London Assurance Company were the only incorporated bodies chartered to write marine insurance. Although this eliminated competition from other corporations, private underwriters, such as those at Lloyd's of London would remain in business. This arrangement continued until the repeal of the act, in 1824.

It was first described by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in 1804, and it contains hundreds of species. Most occur in the tropics and subtropics, and many can run over water. They are commonly called stretch spiders in reference to their elongated body form and their ability to hide on blades of grass or similar elongated substrates by stretching their front legs forward and the others behind them. The name Tetragnatha is derived from Greek, tetra- a numerical prefix referring to four and gnatha meaning \\"jaw\\".

Life Conrad was a member of the powerful Welf family, son of Count Heinrich of Altdorf. After an education at the cathedral school in Constance, he became provost of Constance Cathedral and in 934 was made Bishop of Constance. It is counted as one of his achievements that he avoided becoming enmeshed in the politics of the day and reserved his energies for his episcopal duties. He was nevertheless close to Emperor Otto I, whom he accompanied to Italy in 962. Conrad made three pilgrimages to Jerusalem as well as a number to Rome. He founded a number of churches on the episcopal estates and the hospital at Kreuzlingen, named after a portion of the True Cross which Conrad brought back from Jerusalem and presented to it. Veneration His remembrance as a role model for courage was entirely due to the efforts of Bishop Ulrich I of Dillingen, Bishop of Constance (1111‚Äì1127). The Vita of Conrad was written in about 1120 by Udalschalk, a monk of St. Ulrich's and St. Afra's Abbey, Augsburg, of which he later became abbot (1124 or 1127 to c. 1150 or 1151). Its late date doubtless accounts for its lack of content, notwithstanding which, Conrad was canonised at the First Lateran Council in 1123. Iconography Saint Conrad is sometimes represented as a bishop holding a chalice with a spider in it or over it. This refers to a story that once when he was celebrating mass a spider fell into the chalice. Spiders were believed at that time to be deadly poisonous, but Conrad nevertheless drank the Blood of Christ, which had been transubstantiated from wine, with the spider in it, as a token of faith.

Filmed in Lyons, France, it depicts a number of individuals engaged in a snowball fight on a city street. Plot The camera is centred on a pathway made through a snow- covered city street. On both side of the pathway, several men and women are engaged in a snowball fight. A cyclist rides into the path of the fight, and is hit by snowballs, causing him to lose control of his bicycle and fall to the ground. His cap is flung onto the pathway. One male participant in the engagement grabs a hold of the cyclist's bicycle and lifts it off the ground, and the fallen cyclist scrambles to his feet and yanks his bicycle away from the participant. After retrieving possession of his bicycle, the cyclist climbs back atop it and rides away. Production Bataille de boules de neige was shot in Lyon, France, with a cin√©matographe, an all-in-one camera, which also serves as a film projector and developer. As with all early Lumi√®re movies, this film was made in a 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. Current status Given its age, the copyright on this short film has now expired.

Background  On 3 September 1879 Sir Pierre Cavagnari, the British Resident in Kabul, and his escort were massacred by mutinous Afghan troops, initiating the second phase of the Second Anglo- Afghan War. A force was assembled and named the Kabul Field Force, under the command of Major-General Frederick Roberts. After defeating Afghan forces at Chariasab on 6 October, Roberts marched into Kabul on 13 October. At the end of November, an army under the command of Mohammed Jan Khan Wardak, who had denounced Mohammad Yaqub Khan as a British puppet and instead declared Musa Jan the new amir, gathered in the area north of Kabul. On 11 December a small detachment (c.170 men) of the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers and the 14th Bengal Lancers encountered a 10,000+ Afghan army advancing on Kabul.A Short History of the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers 1715‚Äì1949 As it was of the utmost importance that Mohammed Jan's advance was delayed the woefully outnumbered Lancers charged the Afghans. Heavy casualties were suffered and the Afghans continued their advance. Anglican chaplain James Adams was awarded the Victoria Cross for rescuing the wounded.  The siege  On 15 December, the Afghan army began to besiege the British forces entrenched in the Sherpur Cantonment. As news of a relief column under the command of Brigadier General Charles Gough reached Mohammed Jan, he ordered his troops to storm the cantonment on 23 December. By midday, the assault had been repulsed, and the Afghan army dispersed. No quarter was given to Afghans found in the area with weapons. The Sherpur Cantonment is maintained up to the present as a British military cemetery.

H. Foulkes and Tom Main in the Northfield experiment. Northfield became the centre of a series of experiments led by these eminent physicians, which studied how to deal with trauma caused by war. After the Second World War, Mar√© became a Consultant Psychotherapist at St George's Hospital. In 1952 he set up the Group Analytic Society with Foulkes, and later he participated in setting up the Institute of Group Analysis and the Group Analytic Practice. He also worked with Benaim and Lionel Kreeger at Halliwick Hospital, the short- lived therapeutic community. Mar√© devoted his skills to the practice of group psychotherapy, starting in the traditional small group psychotherapeutic setting, but progressing towards the experience and application of large groups, and later still developing his main interest of the median group. In 1960, Wilfred Foulkes and Patrick de Mar√© established a private clinic, the Group-Analytic Practice. From this work sprung the Group Analytic Society and then, in 1971, the Institute of Group Analysis. He had moved from Fitzrovia to Redington Road, Hampstead, in the 1960s and away from his work he became known for his love of good food, music and hosting parties. In 1972 he published Perspectives in Group Psychotherapy and in 1974 Lionel Kreeger and he published Introduction to Group Treatment in Psychiatry, which was dedicated to the patients and staff at Halliwick Hospital. In 1975 he started a large group under the auspices of the Institute of Group Analysis; in 1976 he was joined by Robin Piper. That 'large' group settled down to a steady membership of about twenty members and became a 'median' group. In 1984 he launched a weekly seminar on large groups that, in 1986, became part of a recognised large group section of the Group Analytic Society. He worked for many years at the Group Analytic Practice in London. David Bohm underwent psychotherapy with Mar√© and was heavily influenced by his work.David Bohm, F. David Peat Science Order and Creativity Routledge 2000 F. David Peat Pathways of Chance Pari Publishing 2007 Patrick de Mar√© was an accomplished player of the accordion, banjo and ukulele. He would play his accordion at bars and caf√©s in Hampstead. He also had a love of opera, and would play music at his practice in Baker Street. After a long and debilitating illness resulting from a street accident he eventually died from pneumonia at the age of 92, survived by his wife, two daughters, and numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

He was a member of the former Nottingham Cricket Club which evolved into Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club during his career and he was mainly associated with these two clubs. He also played for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and he represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. He bowled at an extremely fast pace, using a roundarm action.

He scored 1269 runs at 10.57 with a highest score of 58, that being his sole half-century. He took 34 catches. His bowling statistics are incomplete because for much of his career, bowlers were not credited with wickets falling to catches. Even so, he averaged nearly three wickets per match, with 210 known wickets at 14.77 with a best performance of seven in an innings. He took ten wickets in a match four times. In 1843, Barker was badly injured in an accident involving a horse-drawn cab in London. As a result, he had to stop playing in 1845 and was engaged by the MCC as an umpire. He stood in 70 first- class matches until 1865. During the winter months, he worked in Nottingham as a stockinger. He died in Nottingham, aged 78.

The company moved from Chicago to Racine, Wisconsin in 1926, to Detroit in the 1930s, and from the Detroit area to Bradenton, Florida in 1986. The company would put ads in magazines devoted to children and young adults such as Boys' Life, Popular Mechanics and Science Digest. Their ads appeared on the back cover of many historically significant comic books, including Action Comics #1, June 1938 (first appearance of the character Superman) and Detective Comics #27, May 1939 (first appearance of character Batman).

The dark green rectangles show zones. Zone coverage (also referred to as a zone defense) is a defense scheme in gridiron football used to protect against the pass. Zone coverage schemes require the linebackers and defensive backs to work together to cover certain areas of the field, making it difficult for the opposing quarterback to complete passes. Zone defenses will generally require linebackers to cover the short and midrange area in the middle of the field, in front of the safeties. In the case where one or two linebackers blitz, the remaining linebacker(s) expands his zone to cover the zone responsibilities of the vacating linebacker(s). Often, blitzing will leave larger holes in the pass defense, but it is a gamble the defensive coordinator wants to make to pressure the quarterback into a poor decision and hopefully an interception or at least an incompletion. Coverage shells In the following, \\"cover\\" refers to the \\"shell\\" that the defense rolls into after the snap of the ball, more specifically the number of defenders guarding the deep portion of the field. In passing situations, the defense will assign players to guard portions of the field, forming a defensive \\"shell\\" that the defense hopes will either prevent the offense from completing a pass or ensure a defensive player is able to tackle the receiver after a completed pass. The general terminology used to describe this alignment is \\"Cover #,\\" with \\"#\\" being the number of defensive players forming the coverage shell. Cover 1 Cover One is a man-to-man coverage for all the defensive backs except for one player (usually a safety) who is not assigned a man to cover but rather plays deep and reacts to the development of the play.Bowen, Matt, Why Pressure Sells for Patriots on 3rd Down . January 16, 2013. National Football Post. retrieved June 25, 2013. Often the safety will remain in a pass coverage position and play a zone defense by guarding the middle of the secondary, reacting to runs or completed passes and double-teaming a receiver if needed. In a traditional Cover 1, the free safety plays deep and all of the other defenders lock in man coverage to an assigned player for the duration of the play. Essentially, during the pre- snap read, each defender identifies the coverage responsibilities and does not change the assignment. Some teams play a variant of the Cover 1 called Cover 7. In Cover 7, the free safety still plays deep, but the underneath coverage is much more flexible and the defenders switch assignments as the play develops in an attempt to improve defensive positions to make a play on the ball. Examples of these switches include double covering a certain receiver and using defensive help to undercut a route to block a throwing lane. Advantages Cover 1 schemes are usually very aggressive, preferring to proactively disrupt the offense by giving the quarterback little time to make a decision while collapsing the pocket quickly. This is the main advantage of Cover 1 schemes‚Äîthe ability to blitz from various pre-snap formations while engaging in complex man-to-man coverage schemes post-snap. For example, a safety may blitz while a cornerback is locked in man coverage with a receiver. Or the cornerback may blitz with the safety rotating into man coverage on the receiver post-snap. Disadvantages The main weakness of the Cover 1 scheme is that there is only one deep defender that must cover a large amount of field and provide help on any deep threats. Offenses can attack Cover 1 schemes by sending two receivers on deep routes, provided that the quarterback has enough time for his receivers to get open. The deep defender must decide which receiver to help out on, leaving the other in man coverage which may be a mismatch. A secondary weakness is inherent in its design: the use of man coverage opens up yards after catch lanes. Man coverage is attacked by offenses in various ways that try to isolate their best athletes on defenders by passing them the ball quickly before the defender can react or designing plays that clear defenders from certain areas thus opening yards after catch lanes. Cover 2 Diagram of the Cover 2 defense In traditional Cover 2 schemes the free safety (FS) and strong safety (SS) have deep responsibilities, each guarding half of the field.Vanderlinden, pp. 98‚Äì100.Bowen, Matt, Inside the Playbook: Brady vs. the Bear's Cover 2. March 11, 2011. National Football Post. retrieved June 25, 2013. The NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Indianapolis Colts, Chicago Bears, and New York Giants run a variant of this defense called the Tampa 2. The primary difference between traditional cover 2 and Tampa-2 is the responsibility of the middle linebacker. In traditional cover 2, the middle linebacker covers the underneath zone, with the two safeties taking responsibility for half of the field in the deep zone. Tampa 2 is a hybrid of cover 2 and cover 3 (see below) where the deep safeties have responsibility only for the deep zone \\"outside the hashes\\", while the middle linebacker drops into the middle quarter of the field, covering deep passes between the hash marks. Cover 2 can be run from any seven-man defensive fronts such as the 3-4 and the 4-3. (It is difficult to implement Cover 2 from an eight-in-the-box front, because the strong safety or someone replacing him is usually the eighth man). Various \\"underneath\\" coverage played by cornerbacks and linebackers may also be implemented. For example, Cover 2 Man means 2 safeties have deep responsibility while the cornerbacks and linebackers follow their offensive assignment in one-on-one coverage. The NFL's Los Angeles Rams inherited a base Cover 2 Man 3-4 from Wade Phillips. Cover 2 can also be paired with underneath zone schemes: Cover 2 Zone refers to 2 safeties with deep responsibility but now the CBs and LBs drop back into specific coverage zones where they defend passes only in their assigned area. Teams that play Cover 2 shells usually subscribe to the \\"bend- but-don't-break\\" philosophy, preferring to keep offensive players in front of them for short gains while limiting long passes. This is in stark contrast to a more aggressive Cover 1 type scheme which leaves the offensive team's wide receivers in single man-to-man coverage with only one deep helper. By splitting the deep field between two defenders, the defense can drastically reduce the number of long gains. In Cover 2 the cornerbacks are considered to be \\"hard\\" corners, meaning that they have increased run stopping responsibilities and generally defend against shorter passes, although if two receivers run a deep route on a certain side of the field, that side's corner has deep coverage responsibility as well. The \\"hard\\" corners also generally bear the responsibility of \\"pressing\\" or \\"jamming\\" the offensive receivers- disrupting the receivers intended path downfield. It also relies heavily on the \\"Mike\\" (Middle) linebacker's ability to quickly drop deep downfield into pass coverage when he reads a pass. A variant of cover two is the Inverted Cover 2, in which either right before or after the snap the corners \\"bail\\" out while the safeties come up‚Äîin effect switching responsibilities. This strategy may be employed to trick a quarterback who has not correctly interpreted the shift. The main drawback here is that the middle of the field is left open. Advantages The advantage of cover 2 is that it provides great versatility to the defense as the corners can play run, short pass, and deep pass with the confidence that they have support from two deep safeties. Disadvantages The main weakness of the Cover 2 shell occurs in the middle of the field between the safeties. At the snap of the ball, many times the safeties will move toward the sidelines in order to cover any long passes to quick wide receivers. This movement creates a natural hole between the safeties that can be attacked. By sending a receiver (usually a tight end) into the hole (in the middle of the field), the offense forces the safety to make a decision: play the vulnerable hole or help out on the wide receiver. The quarterback reads the safety's decision and decides on the best matchup (i.e., which mismatch is better: tight end vs. safety or wide receiver vs. cornerback). This disadvantage is ameliorated somewhat in the Tampa 2 variation, however in moving the middle linebacker into deep coverage, it opens up the \\"underneath\\" center zone in the 5-10 yard range. Another disadvantage of Cover 2 is that it leaves only seven men in the \\"box\\" (the area near the ball at the snap) to defend against the run. In contrast Cover 1 and Cover 3 usually have eight men in the box. A potential problem with the Cover 2 is that defensive pressure on the Quarterback must be provided nearly exclusively by the front linemen as all other defenders are involved in pass coverage. If the defensive linemen do not provide adequate pressure on the Quarterback, the offense is afforded plenty of time to create and exploit passing opportunities. Blitzing in the Cover 2 often creates greater areas of weakness in the defense than other coverages. Thus, unsuccessful blitzes can prove to be more productive for the offense than in other schemes. Cover 3 Diagram of the Cover 3 defense In Cover 3, the two corners and free safety each have responsibility for a deep third of the field, while the strong safety plays like a linebacker.Vanderlinden, pp. 89‚Äì93.Bowen, Matt, Inside the Playbook: Cover 3. May 18, 2010 .National Football Post. retrieved June 25, 2013.Bernstein, pp. 205‚Äì208. This coverage is generally considered to be a run stopping defense as it focuses on preventing big pass plays and stopping the run while giving up short passes. On the snap, the CBs work for depth, backpedaling into their assigned zone. One safety moves toward the center of the field. The other safety is free to rotate into the flat area (about 2‚Äì4 yards beyond the line of scrimmage), provide pass coverage help, or blitz. Advantages One of the biggest benefits of the Cover 3 coverage scheme is the ability to walk the strong safety up into the box with minimal to no changes in the coverage due to the pre-snap center field position of the free safety. This enables the defense to play strong against the run, but still prevent explosion plays such as a long pass or break away run. This advantage is most pronounced versus two tight end sets which naturally creates 8 holes for running backs, whereas in cover 2 schemes there are only 7 defenders in the box leaving 1 hole uncovered, or requiring a defender to cover 2 holes. Disadvantages Cover 3 schemes are susceptible to short, timed passes to the outside due to the hard drop of both cornerbacks. This puts pressure on the outside linebackers to react to pass plays and get into their drop quickly if they need to cover a receiver. Another disadvantage of Cover 3 schemes is they are relatively easy to diagnose by opposing quarterbacks. Because of this, teams will often employ slight wrinkles in their coverage to confuse offenses. An example of this includes employing man coverage on one side and zone on another or swapping coverage zones between defenders. Also leaves the seams open and makes the safety choose on four verticals which leaves one open. Cover 4 Cover 4 refers to 4 deep defenders each guarding one-fourth of the deep zone. Cover 4 schemes are almost always used to defend against deep passes.Vanderlinden, pp. 93‚Äì98. (see also Prevent defense). The most basic Cover 4 scheme involves 3 CBs and 2 safeties. Upon snap, the CBs work for depth, backpedaling into their assigned zone. Both safeties backpedal towards their assigned zone. As with other coverage shells, Cover 4 is paired with underneath man or zone coverage in its most basic form. Advantages The main advantage of a Cover 4 defense is that it is extremely difficult for even the best quarterbacks to complete long passes against it. Therefore, this coverage is generally used as a prevent defense to be used near the end of a game or half, meaning that the defense sacrifices the run and short pass to avoid giving up the big play with the confidence that the clock will soon expire. Cover 4 also has the advantage of using safeties in run support as opposed to cornerbacks as would be the case in a Cover 2 scheme. This gives the defense nine in the box and the ability to stop the run with an extra defender on either side. The play-side safety would come up in support on a running play while the back-side safety would be responsible for the middle third of the field and the cornerbacks would have the deep outside thirds. Disadvantages The main weakness of Cover 4 shells is the large amount of space left open by the retreating defensive backs. Since the defensive backs are working for depth, short pass routes underneath can enable the quarterback to make short- and medium- length passes, as well as isolate a defensive back on a wide receiver near the sideline with little help. Cover 6 Diagram of the Cover 6 defense Cover 6 call defensive strength to the Field instead of to the offensive formation or front, and organize personnel by Field-side player and Boundary-side player. The position of the ball on the field therefore dictates strength of the offense. In Cover 6 the field safety and field corner cover fourths of the field, and depend on a field outside linebacker to support underneath them. The free safety covers the boundary-side deep half and the boundary corner plays the flat. Thus the field side of the coverage is quarters, and the boundary side is cover 2.Vanderlinden, pp. 34‚Äì36. The Cover 6 gets its name from the fact that it combines elements of the Cover 2 (the strong safety covering half the field) and the Cover 4 on the opposite side. The Pittsburgh Steelers are a Cover 6 team. The quarters play of the strong side safety, like the Steelers' Troy Polamalu, allows him to support on runs quickly. The Tennessee Titans have also been known to use it. Schemes: On the strong side, the corner and safety play \\"Cover 4 rules\\", which as above the corner and safety each have a quarter of the field working for depth in their zones. The \\"Sam\\" linebacker will be dropping outside to cover the flats. If in 3-4 the Middle Backer will cover that sides hook to curl if not blitzing. On the weak side, the corner and safety play \\"Cover 2 rules\\", which as above the corner stays home in the flats, and the safety covers the deep half. The \\"Will\\" backer will play hook to curl or blitz depending on the call. If in 3-4 usually the \\"Will\\" or the Middle Backer will blitz from that side. The Cover 6 is also good for calling a corner blitz from the weak side, and having the backer cover flats instead. Advantages Cover 6 blends the best of Cover 2 and Cover 4. On the boundary, Cover 6 uses a Cover 2 corner. The boundary corner sits at 5‚Äì7 yards and is in excellent position to attack flat passes and wide runs, as well as blitz from a short field position. The boundary safety plays at 12‚Äì15 yards and supports the boundary corner, providing good pass defense over the top, as well as being able to assist on any vertical release by a 3rd receiver from the field side. The field safety plays a hard read technique from 7‚Äì8 yards, reading first for run. He will fit hard and fast on run plays. He defends the pass by squatting or dropping over the #2 wide receiver. He will then play vertical patterns and in patterns by #2 then #1, passing off inside patterns. The Field corner plays a quarters deep coverage from 7‚Äì8 yards, reading the #1 wide receiver and playing all vertical and outside patterns. Disadvantages Cover 6 has the disadvantages of both Cover 2 and Cover 4. The field side is generally soft on flat coverage. The field side corner can be left in single coverage deep as well. On runs, the field side may be spread by a tight end and 2 receiver formation, offering an advantage on the edge. The Boundary side is hard behind the corner to the sideline, as well as in the seam between corner and linebacker. Cover 0 Cover 0 refers to pure man coverage with no deep defender. Similar to Cover 1, Cover 0 has the same strengths and weaknesses but employs an extra rusher at the expense of deep coverage help leaving each pass defender man-to-man.Vanderlinden, pp. 50‚Äì52. Cover 0 is an aggressive scheme that allows for numerous blitz packages, as it's easier for players to drop off their coverage and rush the quarterback. However, there is no \\"help over the top\\"‚Äîif a wide receiver \\"beats\\" (achieves separation from) his defender, there is no one left in the secondary who can make up the coverage on the receiver, which could result in an easy pass completion and possible touchdown.Bowen, Matt How Did Flacco beat Giants' Cover 0 Pressure. December 27, 2012. National Football Post. retrieved June 25, 2013. Tampa 2 Tampa 2 refers to a style of defense played by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and implemented by its coaches, Tony Dungy, Lovie Smith, and Monte Kiffin, in recent years. Because of its success it has become popular with many professional and college teams. It blends the Cover 2 and Cover 3 defenses by having two defensive backs, usually the safeties, in deep coverage on either side of the field, and a middle linebacker covering the medium to deep middle. Its benefit over the Cover 2 is that the sidelines and middle of the field are better protected against deep threats, with the drawback being a larger open area in the short middle of the field underneath the middle linebacker. Its benefit over the Cover 3 is that it only dedicates two defensive backs to deep coverage rather than three, allowing for better protection against short outside routes. The Tampa 2 generally requires a quick middle linebacker who is capable of staying with tight ends and wide receivers in pass coverage.

The week is organized by LGBT organization Indy Pride, Inc., and has been held under this name and organization for over a decade. In recent years, more than 95,000 gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and heterosexual people have attended Circle City IN Pride Festival. Indy Pride's Parade and Festival is held the 2nd Saturday in June, with a week of events leading up to it, in honor of the Stonewall Riots and in accordance with other United States pride festivals. Indy Pride Festival is the largest LGBT pride event in Indiana. \\"The festival and events are to celebrate gay pride and bring the community together. We're trying to bring visibility to the greater Indianapolis community of how many gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people there are here.\\" - former Indy Pride President, Gary Brackett. History *Indy Pride began in 1996 as a week-long celebration of events. Jeffrey Cleary and Bill McKinley served as Co-Chairs for the city's first ever pride week. The celebration held 10 events in seven days, culminating with a pride fair on the downtown Indy Canal. *The first Indy Pride Parade stepped off in 2002. The first parade was small with only eight participants and lasted 15 minutes. It has since grown into a 2-hour-plus-long event. *In 2011, the festival broke records by attracting a record estimate 70,000 attendees. *In 2012, the week of events opened with the new \\"Rainbow 5k Run/Walk\\". The festival saw the addition of a 2nd stage, as well as an expansion in family-friendly entertainment. Festival Main Stage, 2009, Singer Kat DeLuna. The festival consists of several attractions for the LGBTQ community and allies, to browse and watch. There are several booths sponsored by local LGBT groups catering to the community as a whole, as well as special interest groups. Other booths throughout the park are sponsored by local businesses that support the LGBT community. Surrounding the park, food vendors and other businesses also have displays set up to show support and market to the community. The centerpiece of the event is the main stage that is erected to overlook the event. Here local and national talents perform, providing entertainment for the crowd. Performances include the Pride of Indy Band, singers, national recording artists, drag performances, DJs and speeches. Performances can range from pure entertainment, such as RuPaul who performed at the close of the festival in 2006 and Kat DeLuna who performed in 2009, to informational speeches, such as that from Candace Gingrich, who in 2007, gave a speech for the Human Rights Campaign on same-sex marriage issues. In 2012, the festival added a 2nd stage dedicated to DJs and dance music, as well as an area designated for family friendly entertainment. 2013 marked the 25th year of Indy's public LGBT Pride celebration.

Each year, Circle City IN Pride draws a small number of protestors who voice their opposition to the event. Their opposition is expressed both verbally and on hand-made signs, and is often based on their religious beliefs. Although this group can often be very good at making themselves known, their presence seldom affects the mood of the event.

Career  Wagner was a lawyer who had joined the Nazi Party on 1 July 1931. In 1938 he was appointed acting head of the Central Legal Department in the Berlin Gau (Administrative Region). This position was formerly confirmed in January 1944 by Reichsminister Joseph Goebbels, acting in his capacity as Gauleiter of Berlin.Letter dated 24 March 1944 from the Treasurer of Gau Berlin to the Reichs Treasurer's Personnel Office in Munich Wagner also represented Dr. Goebbels and the Berlin Gau in connection with the re-settlement of Berlin residents in Reichsgau Wartheland, a large area of Poland which had been annexed by the invading Nazi forces in 1939. Wagner carried out duties in that area from January 1943 to February 1944Entry for February 1944 in Arthur Greiser's Guest Book and was based in Posen, the capital, where he not only met the local Governor, Arthur Greiser, but his future wife, Cordula Kroepels, an NSV (National Socialist People's Welfare) social worker who was also involved in the re-settlement programme. Following their marriage on 10 March 1944 they moved to an apartment in Berlin-Buch where they lived together until October 1944. Wagner also held a position with the local Pankow council as administrator of their refuse collection services. In October 1944 Cordula, who was heavily pregnant, left Berlin to live with her mother at Wyk auf Fohr (the second largest of the North Frisian Islands) where their son Michael was born on 1 November.Deposition of Cordula Jessen (formerly Wagner) to Mannheim local court 5 November 1963 In October 1944 Wagner joined the \\"Gauleitung\\" Battalion of the Berlin component of the Volkssturm (Home Guard). He continued living in his Berlin-Buch apartment together with his sister Gustl who last saw him in April 1945 when he was taken to the F√ºhrerbunker.Deposition of Gustl Wagner at Wyk auf Fohr for the Hamburg local court 4 December 1963.  Wagner marries Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun  In late April Hitler decided to marry Eva Braun and subsequently directed Goebbels to find a registrar who could carry out the ceremony. On 28 April Goebbels ordered the Waffen SS to locate Wagner (whom he knew possessed the required qualifications) and bring him to the F√ºhrerbunker. The Waffen SS despatched a unit in an armoured personnel carrier to Wagner's home, only to find that he was fighting in the Friedrichstrasse area. Once located he was taken to the F√ºhrerbunker where he realised that the correct paperwork was not available. The armoured unit was then obliged to take him back to Pankow where he found the correct documents. They then returned to the F√ºhrerbunker. Wagner performed the ceremony just after midnight.The Guardian 10 October 2004 \\"Revealed ‚Äì the man who wed Hitler and Eva Braun\\" The event was witnessed by Goebbels and Martin Bormann. Almost immediately afterwards Wagner left the F√ºhrerbunker and rejoined his unit.  Wagner's death  Wagner's unit was now charged with the defence of the Potsdamer Platz. The fighting was desperate and chaotic. Wagner's friend, colleague and company commander, Erich Illing, was severely wounded by Russian tank fire. Wagner, the Number 1 Section Commander immediately assumed command of the company. As he continued the fight in the Anhalter Bahnhof area he was shot in the head and killed.Hitler and Women ‚Äì The Love Life of Adolf Hitler, Ian Sayer & Douglas Botting, Constable & Robinson London, 2004 p. 207 It was less than 24 hours since he had married Hitler and Eva Braun. His body was never found.  Post World War Two  In 1951 Wagner's widow, Cordula, who had moved to Hamburg with the son he had never seen, wished to re-marry. She petitioned the Hamburg Court to issue a death certificateHitler and Women ‚Äì The Love Life of Adolf Hitler. Constable & Robinson London, 2004 p. 279 and, after submitting a number of affidavits from individuals who had been present at the time of Wagner's death, it was finally granted. In 1963 Stern magazine reported to the Hamburg Court that there were rumours circulating in Frankfurt that Wagner was living there.Letter dated 13 April 1951 from lawyer Helmut Rufer to Hamburg local court The court reopened the case. Gustl was questioned by a judge in Wyk and Cordula was interviewed in Mannheim. The case was subsequently closed.  The Last Card  Walter Wagner was an enigma. Plucked from obscurity at a critical moment in world history he enjoyed a few brief hours of fame before plunging back into obscurity and dying almost immediately afterwards in the Apocalypse that was Berlin in April 1945. Both his Christian and surnames were common throughout Germany. However, as the notary who had married Hitler and Eva Braun his name appeared in every major work on the Battle of Berlin and Hitler's last days. However, although he was portrayed in many post war films, the real Walter Wagner remained a faceless individual until 2004 when the first photograph of him was published in Hitler and Women ‚Äì The Love Life of Adolf Hitler, Ian Sayer & Douglas Botting Constable & Robinson London, 2004 . In 1980 investigative writer Ian Sayer purchased a postcard, handwritten by Walter Wagner on 30 March 1945. It was addressed to his wife on the Frisian island of Fohr where she was living with his, as yet, unseen son. The stamp was a typical Nazi stamp bearing Hitler's effigy. Someone had written at the top in another hand \\"The Last Card\\". Wagner's handwriting was so indecipherable that it took Sayer 22 years to obtain a full translation. During the intervening period Sayer had attempted to locate any surviving members of Wagner's family. In 2002 he located Wagner's son, which prompted the publication of Hitler and Women which contained the first photograph of Wagner to be published. During his investigation Sayer had learned that Wagner's wife had been interrogated by British Intelligence at the end of the war to establish if she had heard from Wagner who had disappeared in Berlin. He was wanted for questioning in connection with the marriage of Hitler and Eva Braun. The British Intelligence officer had retained the card and sold it at auction 35 years later.  Portrayal in the media  The scene of Hitler's wedding is depicted in the films Hitler: The Last Ten Days, The Bunker and Der Untergang (Downfall), all of which correctly portray Wagner, in accordance with Nazi law, asking Hitler and Braun to confirm that they were of pure \\"Aryan\\" descent before the marriage can proceed. Walter Wagner has been portrayed by the following actors in film and television productions: * Georg-Michael Wagner in the 1971 Eastern Bloc co- production Liberation: The Last Assault * Andrew Sachs in the 1973 British film Hitler: The Last Ten Days * John Ringham in the 1973 British television production The Death of Adolf Hitler * Robert Austin in the 1981 United States television production The Bunker * Norbert Heckner in the 2004 German film Downfall (Der Untergang) References Category:1907 births Category:1945 deaths Category:German people of World War II Category:Notaries Category:Lawyers in the Nazi Party Category:Jurists from Berlin ","title":"Walter Wagner (notary)"},{"id":"11697272","text":"Augustus Martin is the name of: *Augustus Marie Martin (1803‚Äì1875), Bishop of Natchitoches *Augustus N.

The film premiered on May 21, 2007 at the Cannes Film Market. It was later adapted in Bollywood as Accident on Hill Road starring Celina Jaitley in Mena Suvari's role. It was the final film Gordon directed before his death. Plot The film takes place in Providence, Rhode Island where Thomas \\"Tom\\" Bardo (Stephen Rea) is having a particularly bad day; not only has his unemployment run out, but he has also been evicted from his apartment. Retirement-home caregiver Brandi Boski (Mena Suvari) is potentially up for a promotion at work, and celebrates with a night of drinking and MDMA before driving home. On the way home, Brandi hits Tom with her car and he becomes trapped in her car's windshield. Afraid of being arrested, Brandi continues to drive home with the promise that she will get Tom help. But as she begins to debate the issue, Brandi feels the accident will destroy her life and opts to take a taxi to work, leaving him to die slowly in her garage. When Tom realizes that, he painfully tries to escape. Brandi enlists the help of her boyfriend, Rashid (Russell Hornsby), in an attempt to kill and dispose of Tom. Meanwhile, Tom is able to pull himself free from the windshield, but before he is able to escape the garage, Rashid and Brandi restrain him. They go back into Brandi's house and decide to kill Tom, and hide the evidence by burning both Tom's corpse and the car. Rashid returns to the garage, and prepares to shoot the apparently unconscious Tom with a revolver. But Tom, secretly awake, manages to attack Rashid before stabbing him through the eye with a concealed pen, killing him. During the brawl, a shot is discharged from the gun, prompting Brandi to investigate. Tom tries to start the car, but Brandi enters the garage before he is able to do so. Tom knocks Brandi over and limps out of the garage towards the street, taking Rashid's gun with him. Brandi pursues Tom, wielding a hammer from the garage. Tom pleads with Brandi to stay back, not wanting to fire on her, but she subdues him with the hammer. She drags Tom back to the garage and begins dousing the room with gasoline, panicking. She hopes that the police will conclude that Tom broke in, attacked Rashid and accidentally became engulfed in flames while trying to burn the garage down. However, Tom is able to sneak back into the car, start it and drive forwards, pinning Brandi against the back of the garage. Brandi begs for help, while Tom steps out of the car and lights a match. He asks why she didn't help him, and Brandi says she doesn't know, and continues to plead for her life. Tom decides to spare Brandi and extinguishes the match. Brandi suddenly produces Rashid's revolver and fires on Tom, who ducks beside the car and a stray bullet ignites the gasoline, setting Brandi alight. As she screams in pain, burning to death, Tom struggles to the front of the garage and is able to open the door. Tom stumbles out onto the driveway and collapses as neighbours surround him, alerted by the fire. Tom is helped away and turns to look back at the burning garage, where Brandi's screaming has subsided.

Stuck opened in limited release in the United States on May 30, 2008. Reception Stuck received generally favorable reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 72% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 82 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 61 out of 100, based on 25 reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called the film a \\"grim, expert little thriller.\\" Holden compared the character Tom Bardo and the setting of the film to director Stuart Gordon's 2005 film Edmond (in which Suvari also appeared). Holden wrote \\"Stuck, while not strictly a horror film, is steeped in gore and carries a seam of mocking gallows humor as relentless as that of Sweeney Todd.\\" Holden said the film \\"is exceptional because its characters feel like real people plunged into a disorienting situation in which they behave like monsters.\\" Ken Fox of TV Guide gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and called the film \\"a drum-tight, extremely grisly thriller. And odd as it may sound given the subject matter, it's also surprisingly funny.\\" Fox praised the script by John Strysik, calling it \\"blackly funny\\" and said \\"Rea does quite a bit with a role that keeps him face down and bleeding like a stuck pig for most of the movie, but this is definitely Suvari's show.\\" Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice said \\"Stuck is both darkly comic and disgusting; the name alone reduces the crime to a sick joke.\\" Joe Leydon of Variety said \\"Stuck is ingeniously nasty and often shockingly funny as it incrementally worsens a very bad situation, then provides a potent payoff...\\" Leydon called it a \\"darkly comical farce\\" and said it could generate a cult following through a \\"carefully calibrated theatrical rollout, especially if it generates want-to-see buzz in key regions of the blogosphere.\\" Leydon called the script \\"crafty\\" and the director Stuart Gordon \\"establishes a heightened-reality tone of bleak hilarity early on.\\" Leydon said the film \\"overall has the look and feel of a tawdry B-movie. Whether that's due to budgetary limitations or artistic inspiration, it serves the material well.\\" J.R. Jones of the Chicago Reader said \\"As the title of this splatter comedy by writer-director Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator) indicates, [Tom]'s like a bug stuck to her windshield, and that's about the level of humanity and insight one can expect here.\\" The film appeared on some critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club named it the 7th best film of 2008, and Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club named it the 10th best film of 2008. In the book The New American Crime Film, scholar Matthew Sorrento describes the film as using \\"widespread media fodder to create a tale of isolated torment that is, like Edmond, minimalistic and absurdist[.... It] moves beneath moral judgment to depict the humanity of those caught in tough spots.\\" Box office The film opened in limited release in the United States on May 30, 2008 and grossed $8,844 in 2 theaters. It was shown in as many as 16 theaters as of June 6, 2008. The film grossed $146,154 worldwide -- $67,505 in the United States and $78,649 in other territories. Awards and nominations Director Stuart Gordon won the Silver Raven award at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film and also the Staff Prize for Narrative Feature at the San Francisco Indiefest for the film. Inspiration Stuck was based on the true story of Chante Jawan Mallard, a Texas woman who received 50 years in prison for the murder of a homeless man, Gregory Biggs. She hit Biggs, allegedly while driving impaired, and he became lodged in her windshield after the collision. She drove home, parked her car in the garage with Biggs still lodged, alive and conscious, in the windshield. While she did go out to apologize to Biggs, she failed to call for any assistance and allowed him to die. Mallard and two accomplices then took the body to a local park, where it was discovered. She was arrested four months later after bragging about the incident at a party. The Fort Worth Medical Examiner and other experts all testified at the trial that basic first responder care would have saved Biggs' life. The film attracted some criticism for whitewashing. White actor Mena Suvari, in cornrows, plays a character based on Chante Jawan Mallard, who is of African American descent.

During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, it was the most successful recording studio in Western Canada and was the home for many years to producers Bruce Fairbairn and Bob Rock. Little Mountain recorded albums by Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Metallica, Bryan Adams, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, David Lee Roth, Loverboy, and the Cult among many others. In the mid 1990s Little Mountain would become part of Vancouver Studios; the facility would eventually evolve into Greenhouse Studios and would record albums by Nickelback, k.d. lang, Default, and Queensr√øche. History Little Mountain Sound Studios was started in 1972 as a 50/50 partnership between Western Broadcasting (CKNW radio) and Griffiths, Gibson Productions (GGP). Bob Brooks was hired to manage Little Mountain. Brooks was an independent producer working out of an office at CKWX after having left Homer Street Studios. In 1977, Western Broadcasting bought out GGP to become sole owner. In 1982, Western Broadcasting sold the studio to Bob Brooks. Brooks owned Little Mountain until 1992. Bruce Fairbairn started recording at Little Mountain Sound Studios with Prism, a band in which he played trumpet. Fairbairn would go on to do the bulk of his work there as an independent producer. Bob Rock was a house engineer at Little Mountain, and engineered many albums for Fairbairn before becoming a producer himself. Brooks turned over the running of the studio to a manager in the late 1980s. Brooks then replaced the manager with Bruce Levens. Levens purchased Little Mountain after managing for six months. Little Mountain relocated to Burnaby after closing in Vancouver at the end of 1993. For the next decade, Little Mountain was an equipment and services company to various producers, engineers, studios, and bands. Bruce Leven and his wife continued to provide sound recording services through Greenhouse Studios. Little Mountain moved back to Vancouver in 2008.

Vartiovuori observatory from the south. Vartiovuori observatory is the former observatory of the Royal Academy of Turku. The building was completed 1819, and was designed by the German architect Carl Ludvig Engel. The neoclassical observatory is a typical Engel work, with obvious similarities to the Helsinki University Observatory and Pulkovo Observatory (in St. Petersburg, Russia), which he also designed. The observatory is located atop of the Vartiovuori hill in Turku, close to the cathedral and Aura river and it's visible from many places in the city center. The Great Fire Of Turku The observatory and several wooden houses (current Luostarinm√§ki Handicrafts Museum) on the hill were saved from the Great Fire of Turku 1827. Observatory is famous for a note made by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander who was working at 4 September 1827: :Hic observationes terribili illo interceptae sunt incendio, quod totam fere urbem ad cineres reduxit, observatorium vero, gratiae habeantur Deo O.M., salvum intactumque reliquit. or \\"Here the observations were stopped by a horrible fire which burn the whole city into ashes but, thanks to God, left the observatory intact\\". The Academy moved to Helsinki after the Fire and got a new observatory there few years later. Instruments were moved to Helsinki and finally Vartiovuori Observatory became defunct 1834. In 1836 √Öbo Navigationsskola (Swedish Maritime School) moved into empty observatory building and stayed there until 1967. Between 1986 and 1998 building was a maritime museum and during the repair of the Turku Art Museum 1999-2005, the changing exhibitions were placed in observatory.

The 17th as part of Birney's Division was pushed forward to occupy the stone wall at the western edge of the Wheat Field abutting the woods there. Only the intervention of the V Corps saved the II Corps from annihilation. 17th Maine saw hot and heavy action being attacked from two sides.

Armament 1853 Enfield rifle-musket Springfield Model 1861 The 17th Maine was an 1862, Army of the Potomac, three-year regiment, that greatly increased the number of men under arms in the federal army. As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough Model 1861 Springfield Rifles to go around so they were instead issued imported British Pattern 1853 rifles. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the Crimean War. The Enfield was a .577 calibre Mini√©-type muzzle-loading rifled musket. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces. At Gettysburg, on the evening of July 3, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the Springfield Model 1861 Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch Minie Ball. and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service. Casualties and total strength The 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence. It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease. 31 men died in Confederate prisons. Total fatalities for the regiment were 370.

He's just a little, almost elfin creature who's not really out to hurt anybody or has any ill will or malice toward anybody. He's just absolutely out of his mind unhinged.\\"Paul Dini. A Pest in the House - DVD audio commentary - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5. It was only one of three non-Bugs Bunny cartoons from 1947 not to be reissued. The others were Mexican Joyride and Catch as Cats Can (which is the only one of the three that Daffy doesn't appear in). The cartoon was followed up in 1948 by Daffy Duck Slept Here, wherein Daffy (this time as a fellow guest) again doesn't let a hotel patron sleep - in this case Porky Pig. Plot The cartoon starts with a brief narration describing a labor shortage that \\"became so bad\\" that compels employers to hire \\"anybody or-- anything\\". At the \\"Gland Hotel\\", Daffy is a hotel bellboy and Elmer Fudd is the manager. Elmer tells Daffy to take a customer to room 666. The customer (voiced by Arthur Q. Bryan, in his natural voice) asks for peace and quiet, and suddenly threatens to punch Elmer right in the nose if he's disturbed at any time. Daffy, in a Jerry Colonna-like sarcastic aside to the audience, remarks: \\"Likable chap, isn't he?\\", intending to take advantage of this condition to cause pain to his employer. Daffy does many stunts that keep the man awake, complete with escorting him to room 666. Every time he is awakened again, the increasingly irritated man trudges to the lobby, to the tune of \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", and at the second where the song says \\"pop\\", he punches Elmer in the face (Elmer at one point gets hit through the phone and later dons a knight's helmet in a futile attempt to prevent getting hit). After several shenanigans (including barging in to tell him the legendary \\"traveling salesman story\\", only to forget the punch line), Daffy finally concludes it is too cold in the man's room and decides to fix the radiator. Elmer, knowing he'll get beat up again, chases after Daffy. Daffy makes the heat vibrate to the room. Elmer hears whistling and covers it with several pillows. Daffy, thinking that Elmer is blowing whistles, proceeds to rant loudly to him: \\"So, a fine kettle of fish! Here I work myself down to the skin and bones trying to keep this guy to sleep, and what do you do? Blow whistles! Just when I got things so quiet you could hear a pin drop, you bust in here and bust out with a whistle, and you snafu the whole works! How in the name of all that's reasonable do you expect a guy to get his slumber when a goof like you goes around making noises like a one-man Fourth of July celebration? He needs peace and quiet! It's positively outrageous!\\". His screaming obviously wakes the now infuriated man, so Elmer hurries downstairs and he and Daffy switch places through a promotion in an effort to fool the man: \\"Fow vewy mewitowious sewvice, you are hewewith pwomoted to the position of managew. Take ovew.\\" However, Elmer gets punched one last time, and Daffy concludes the cartoon with another Jerry Colonna-like aside: \\"Noisy little character, isn't he?\\".

Nowadays there are no more deer on this island, but the island does have a luxury golf course.The only method of access is by ferry from Trou d'Eau Douce or by specific speed boats or catamarans. The part of the ocean surrounding the islet is rather shallow, so you can walk for more than 100 meters in the ocean and the water won't cover you. A great number of tourists visit the island every day, especially on weekends. Near the beach there are many merchants selling all kinds of Mauritian souvenirs, clothing and handmade accessories. Round Island Round Island is an uninhabited islet 22.5 kilometers north of Mauritius. It has an area of 2.08 square kilometers and a maximum elevation of 280 meters. The island is a nature reserve under the jurisdiction of the Mauritian Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Rare reptiles that are endemic to Round Island include the Round Island skink, Round Island day gecko, and Round Island boa. Geographic coordinates: √éle de la Passe √éle de la Passe is a rocky islet in the bay of Grand Port on the island of Mauritius. Between 20‚Äì25 August 1810, during the British campaign to capture the island (then called √éle de France) from the French, it was the scene of a long and very hard-fought action between roughly equal forces of French and British frigates and, on balance, a defeat for the British, who lost four frigates, though one of these was subsequently recaptured and the French squadron did not survive the British invasion of Mauritius. Coin de Mire Coin de Mire, also called Gunner's Quoin, measures just 65 hectares and lies 8 km north of Mauritius. There are remnants of a sugar plantation set up by Dutch settlers. Gunner's Quoin is near Ile Plate, also called \\"Flat Island\\". √éle D'Ambre √éle D'Ambre, or Amber Island, is an islet off the eastern coast of Mauritius. It is relatively large compared to some of the other islets, and it has a number smaller islets of its own, including √éle Mounick, Matapan Island and √élot Canarde. The Forestry Services of the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Natural Resources is in charge of the islet. It is known for having the last definite sighting of a dodo in 1662. Pointe Bernache Located not too far from √éle D'Ambre, Pointe Bernache is a small islet which is popular with tourists as it has a stunning beach on its south coast. The island is surrounded by a lagoon, which is often fished in. Flat Island Flat island, known as √éle Plate in French, is located near Round Island, √éle aux Serpents and Coin de Mire at the extreme north of Mauritius. It includes Flat Island, which is at risk of submerging, the unvegetated √élot Gabriel and the tiny Pigeon Rock. There is a graveyard on the island dating back to the 19th century; people suffering from malaria and other diseases were sent to the island by the British to stop the germs from spreading. It also houses one of the two working lighthouses in Mauritius. Flat island area harbors an internationally famous dive site called The Shark Pit where divers can witness sharks swirling within the pit for the rich oxygen available due to the crushing waves against the cliffs of Pigeon Rock \\" Shark Pit Diving spot \\" entry on Bloosee. Grand Port Islets The Grand Port islets once made up a small volcanic island which has submerged with the rising tide. The islets around Grand Port include √éle aux Flamants, √éle Vacoas, √éle Fouquet, √éle aux Fous, √éle aux Oiseaux, Rocher des Oiseaux, √éle de la Passe (above), √éle Marianne, √élot Chats and √éle aux Signes amongst many others. Clashes between the French and English sometimes took place around the islands in the Battle of Grand Port, to determine control of Mauritius. Reservoir Islets The reservoirs of La Ferme and La Mare du Vacoas both have at least one small, land-tied islet within them. In the case of La Ferme (an unnamed islet, but often called √éle de la Ferme), there is a small weather station on the islet. √éle aux Serpents Known as Serpent Islet or Serpent Island in English, there are, despite the name, no snakes on the island; the last indigenous snake species once survived here but became extinct shortly after European arrival. The islet is mountainous. A subspecies of Serpent Island gecko, Nactus serpensinsula serpensinsula, is endemic to this islet. Centipede Scolopendra abnormis is only found on this islet (where it is abundant) and the nearby √éle Ronde, Mauritius. Mouchoir Rouge Mouchoir Rouge, located in the bay of Grand Port, in Mahebourg, has a small guest house which is permanently inhabited. There was once another small islet not far away, but this has sunk in recent years and at low tide emerges as a rock. √éle aux Benitiers √éle aux Benitiers includes a large island, with coconut plantations and is permanently inhabited and the smaller √élot Benitier. The main island is 2 km long and 500m wide lying off of La Gaulette. The islet of √élot Benitier has been on private lease since 1927 and also supports a small plantation, but is only accessibly for a few months a year. On the northern tip of the main island there are small colonies of migratory birds. √éle aux Benitiers is currently under Nubheebucus Family Control. √élot du Mort Known as Dead Man Island by the British, the island is known to be the site of many shipwrecks. It is located off the coast of Rivi√®re du Rempart District. Barkley Island Barkley island is a small, rocky islet located in the Port Louis Harbour. The Caudan Waterfront incorporates the islet as an anchorage for the many ships that visit the harbour. √éle Albatross √éle Albatross is located near Savanne, southern Mauritius. There are thousands of migratory birds on the island and it has been declared a nature reserve. √éle Fournaise A small, once-volcanic islet off the coast of √éle D'ambre, this islet was named after the famous volcano on nearby R√©union. It is thought to have broken away from √éle D'ambre.  √éle des deux Cocos  Also known as √éle aux deux Cocos, the island, located off the southern coast of Grand Port, is named after the two abandoned coconut plantations it houses. The plantations were set up by the French, but were abandoned after crops were damaged during a lengthy storm in the 18th century.  √éle de L'Est and √éle aux Chats  Both of these relatively large islands, lying to the east of Mauritius and considered part of Flacq, become temporarily merged at low tide. The islets are an increasingly popular camping site and there are plans to rebuild a disused lodge on √éle de L'Est. √éle aux Lubines This islet is located not too far off from √éle aux Chats; it is a nature reserve that can be visited with permission. √éle Vacoas Not to be confused with the Grand Port islet, the √éle Vacoas of Flacq was named after the Vacoas (sugarcane in Creole) which was planted by the European arrivals. √élot Seychelles √élot Seychelles is a small islet within the Port Louis harbour. The name comes from the Seychelles islands to the north. Le Souffleur The small Le Souffleur was named so due to the whistling sound it makes when the waves crash against the rocks. It is located on the southern side of the Savanne district, not far from Souillac. http://www.info-mauritius.com/forum/gallery/souffleur-a92/ √éle Fregate Named after the uncommon Fregate colony on the island, √éle Fregate has been declared a nature reserve by the Mauritian government. √éle aux Tonneliers and √éle Albatross Originally a single peninsula joined to mainland Port Louis, this has since split to form two separate islets. √éle aux Tonneliers is the larger of the two, which serves as an anchorage site for ships. The island is covered in shrub. √éle Albatross is smaller and unvegetated. √éle Sancho The islet of √éle Sancho is relatively new, having as recently as the 1950s been a small sandbank. It is now covered with vegetation and is a stopping point for vessels travelling through the Indian Ocean. It is located off the coast of Savanne and is surrounded by an extended reef. √éle Roches √éle Roches is located in between Grand Port and Flacq. There is little vegetation and has been of little use since an unsuccessful attempt by the British to plant coconut trees there. √éle Crabe √éle Crabe is a small islet off the eastern coast of Rodrigues. It is named after the large colony of Land Crabs on the island. √éle aux Sables and √éle aux Cocos √éle aux Sables and √éle aux Cocos are two islets off the eastern coast of Rodrigues. Both are nature reserves and home to meteorological stations. They are well known for their abundant birdlife. Cat Island Cat Island () is a small island lying south of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is surrounded by a coral reef and is known for its diving and snorkelling sites. Hermitage Island Hermitage Island () is a small island lying south west of Port Sud-Est in Rodrigues. It is reputed to be the location of buried treasure and is a popular destination for tourists. √éle aux Fous Crazy Island (French: √éle aux Fous) is a small island lying off the coast of Rodrigues, √éle aux Fous is named after the leper colony on the island during the Dutch conquest of Mauritius.

Contributing to Peel programmes over several years, Stanshall played many new and old songs. He piloted and previewed many different musical and spoken-word comedy sketches and songs. Peel would later broadcast recordings made especially by Stanshall as parts of a sporadic \\"Rawlinson End\\" saga, such as, \\"Aunt Florrie Remembers (from Giant Whelks at Rawlinson End, Part 21),\\" recorded on 16 October and broadcast on 27 October 1975.Vivian Stanshall, Rawlinson End, Sansun, UK Ultimately, Stanshall re-recorded several of these turns for release, all of which related to Sir Henry Rawlinson and his country seat, Rawlinson End. The album Sir Henry at Rawlinson End (1978) was released on the Charisma Records label (CAS 1139), featuring Stanshall as multiple characters, talking and singing, in a portrayal of the fictional history of Sir Henry Rawlinson. It is filled with puns, double-entendres, pop-cultural references and clever wordplay. Stanshall initially takes the role of an unnamed narrator, then shifts between character and narrator. The recording features many musical interludes, performed on a variety of odd musical instruments. Guest performers include Steve Winwood and two of Stanshall's children: his son Rupert Stanshall and his stepdaughter, Sydney Longfellow (the child of his second wife Ki Longfellow-Stanshall). Characters The tracks are named after musical pieces, and most feature at least one vocal number, intermingled with spoken-word performances. Stanshall's characters include Sir Henry Rawlinson, his wife Lady Florrie Rawlinson (n√©e Maynard), their children Ralph ('Raif') and Candice Rawlinson, and Henry's brothers Hubert (the younger brother) and Humbert (late older brother, deceased, and now a ghost). Additional characters include the staff of Rawlinson End: Mr. Cumberpatch (former gardener), Old Scrotum the Wrinkled Retainer (butler) and Mrs. E (housekeeper); various relatives: Florrie's brother Lord Tarquin Portly of Staines and his wife Lady Phillipa of Staines.

The Sacred Cenote (, , \\"sacred well\\"; alternatively known as the \\"Well of Sacrifice\\") is a water-filled sinkhole at the pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site of Chichen Itza, in the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula. It is located to the north of Chichen Itza's civic precinct, to which it is connected by a sacbe, or raised and paved pathway.Adams (1991), p. 290 According to post-Conquest sources (Maya and Spanish), pre-Columbian Maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the Maya rain god Chaac. Edward Herbert Thompson dredged the Cenote Sagrado from 1904 to 1910, and recovered artifacts of gold, jade, pottery, and incense, as well as human remains.Coggins (1992) A study of human remains taken from the Cenote Sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice.Anda Alan√≠s (2007) Description and History The northwestern Yucat√°n Peninsula is a limestone plain, with no rivers or streams, lakes or ponds. The region is pockmarked with natural sinkholes, called cenotes, which expose the water table to the surface. One of the most impressive of these is the Sacred Cenote, which is in diameterCano 2002, p.85. and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some below. According to ethnohistoric sources, the Sacred Cenote was a place of pilgrimage for ancient Maya people who would conduct sacrifices into it. As Friar Diego de Landa observed in 1566 after visiting Chichen Itza: :\\"Into this well they have had, and then had, the custom of throwing men alive as a sacrifice to the gods, in times of draught, and they believed that they did not die though they never saw them again. They also threw into it a great many other things, like precious stones and things which they prized. And so, if this country had possessed gold, it would be this well that would have the great part of it.\\"Landa 1941, pp.179-182. Archaeological explorations of the cenote Edward Herbert Thompson Orange-peel dredge used by Thompson 1904-1910 to excavate the Sacred Cenote. Most of the major findings in the cenote were made under the supervision of Edward Herbert Thompson, who began dredging in 1904. Much of what is known about the dredging process is derived from Thompson‚Äôs personal notes. Thompson received money from Stephen Salisbury III to help him buy the Chich√©n Itz√° excavation site and explore the cenote. Much of Thompson‚Äôs findings and research can be found at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University.Sabloff (1994), pp. 34-47 A bucket attached to a pulley system was used to dredge the cenote. Much of the beginning work consisted of clearing debris and fallen trees on the top of the water. Leon Cole, a colleague of Thompson, once recorded in his journal, ‚Äúthey made ten hauls in the morning and six or eight in the afternoon.‚Äù People would search through the buckets of water looking for artifacts and categorizing them accordingly. Unfortunately, there were several reports of stolen artifacts that could never be found. Thompson decided to take a break from dredging after Salisbury died. A host of problems, including the Mexican Revolution, and financial issues began to hinder the work effort and damage the morale of the workers. Thompson‚Äôs house in Mexico was also burned down, and one of the chests in which he kept his notes and data was destroyed in the fire. By 1923, Thompson was officially done working on the cenote. Diving in the cenote In 1909, Thompson decided to dive in the cenote to explore the floors, assisted by two Greek divers from the Bahamas. He reported limited visibility due to the murky water, and many shifting rocks and trees made the dive hazardous. Thompson found a layer about thick of blue pigment that had settled on the ground of the cenote. He described the bottom as, ‚Äúfull of long narrow cracks, radiating from centers as if the glass bottom of a dish had been broken by a pointed instrument. We found down in the cracks and holes a grayish mud in which were imbedded the heavier gold objects, jades, and copper bells in numbers.‚Äù He later proudly proclaimed, ‚ÄúI have at last personally trod the bottom of the Cenote.‚Äù Dredging under the Mexican authorities In 1961, William Folan, a field director for the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (INAH), helped launch another expedition into the cenote. Some of their notable discoveries included an inscribed, gold-sheathed bone, a large chert knife with a gold-sheathed wooden handle, and wooden ear flares with jade and turquoise mosaic. In 1967-1968, Norman Scott and Rom√°n Pi√±a Ch√°n led another expedition. They tried two new methods that many people had suggested for a long time: emptying the water out of the cenote and clarifying the water. Both of these methods were only partially successful. Only about of water could be removed, and the water was clarified for only a short amount of time. Objects found in the Sacred Cenote Archaeological investigations have removed thousands of objects from the bottom of the cenote, including artifacts made from gold, jadeite, copal, pottery, flint, obsidian, shell, wood, rubber, and cloth, as well as human skeletons.Coggins 1984, pp. 26-7 Many perishable objects were preserved by the cenote. Wooden objects which normally would have rotted were preserved in the water. A great variety of wooden objects have been found including weapons, scepters, idols, tools, and jewelry. Jade was the largest category of objects found, followed by textiles. The presence of jade, gold and copper in the cenote offers proof of the importance of Chich√©n Itz√° as a cultural city center. None of these raw materials are native to the Yucat√°n, which indicates that they were valuable objects brought to Chich√©n Itz√° from other places in Central America and then sacrificed as an act of worship. Pottery, stone, bone and shells were also found in the cenote. Archaeologists have found that many objects show evidence of being intentionally damaged before being thrown into the cenote, and have speculated that this intentional damage is meant to be analogous to ‚Äúkilling‚Äù the object as a sacrifice.Shane (1984), pp. 13-29 Human sacrifice Certain cenotes contain a large number of human remains, including both males and females, and young children/infants. According to archaeologist Guillermo de Anda of the University of Yucat√°n, evidence from Mayan mythology suggests that many young victims (most aged 6 to 12) were male. While the classical images of a female Mayan sacrifice being flung alive to drown in a cenote are pervasive, Guillermo de Anda's writings on the subject suggest that most sacrificial victims ‚Äî juveniles who were either purchased or captured while their parents were working in the fields, warriors captured in battle, or elites captured during conflicts with neighboring clans ‚Äî were usually (though not always) killed prior to being thrown into the cenote, and in many cases, dozens of miles from the cenotes in which their bodies were eventually deposited. He also notes that only a certain set of cenotes was used in this way, while others were reserved for domestic purposes (de Anda 2007). This suggests that Mayan religious officiants believed that only certain cenotes led to the underworld, and sacrifices placed in others would serve no purpose. It also suggests that the status of the victim as alive or dead was unimportant. The occasional appearance of human remains in non-sacrificial cenotes can be attributed to rare errors in judgement on the part of the shaman. The actual pattern by which a particular victim's remains became interred in which cenotes remains a subject of conjecture. The Franciscan leader Diego de Landa reported that he witnessed live sacrifices being thrown into the cenote at Chich√©n Itz√°. However, his account does not indicate the regularity of this behavior.

In cooperation with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt he started two foundations for the rehabilitation of polio patients and the research on polio prevention and treatment. From 1944 to 1949 he was chairman and president of the American Red Cross and from 1945 to 1950 he was chairman of the League of Red Cross Societies. Biography Early life Daniel Basil O'Connor was born January 8, 1892, in Taunton, Massachusetts. His father was a tinsmith. O'Connor grew up poor but scrappy ‚Äî an \\"Irishman one generation removed from servitude\\", as he described himself. He became a newsboy at age 10, and organized a monopoly of the city's newspaper routes. He earned money for college by playing the fiddle in a dance orchestra. When he arrived in New York he dropped his first name after seeing the long list of D. O'Connors in the phone book. Lawyer and businessman Basil O'Connor did his undergraduate work at Dartmouth College and graduated from Harvard Law School, then was admitted to the bar to practice law in 1915. For one year he worked in New York for the law firm of Cravath & Henderson, and for the next three years for Streeter & Holmes in Boston. In 1919 he founded his own law firm in New York. In 1920 O'Connor met Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was running for Vice President on the Democratic ticket. O'Connor became his legal advisor. In 1924 the two men associated in their own law firm which existed until Roosevelt's first Presidential inauguration in 1933. Beginning in 1934 O'Connor was senior partner in the law firm of O'Connor & Farber. He was also executive manager of a number of companies, among them the New England Fuel Oil Corporation in the 1920s, and the American Reserve Insurance Corporation and the West Indies Sugar Corporation in the 1940s. Fight against polio In August 1921, while vacationing with his family at their summer home on Campobello Island, Franklin D. Roosevelt fell ill and was diagnosed with polio. FDR later sought therapy at a resort in Warm Springs, Georgia. After visiting Roosevelt there O'Connor characterized the place as \\"a miserable mess\\", and he decided to promote public support for the rehabilitation of those with polio. In 1927, he and Roosevelt and a group of friends created the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation, in which O'Connor served first as treasurer and later as president. More than $1 million was raised for the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation by the first nationwide President's Birthday Ball on January 30, 1934. The foundation was reconstituted as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, founded by Roosevelt on January 3, 1938. The nationwide President's Birthday Ball of 1938 was dubbed \\"the March of Dimes\\" by radio star Eddie Cantor, and in time it became the foundation's official name.Barrett, William P. \\"March of Dimes' Second Act\\". Forbes, November 19, 2008. The notable fundraising campaign appealed to Americans to \\"send your dime to President Roosevelt at the White House\\" for the fight against polio. The 1938 campaign was a smashing success and revolutionized fundraising in America, with over $1,800,000 raised. \\"His genius was in generating large numbers of relatively small contributions for a cause,\\" The New York Times wrote of O'Connor. \\"Over the years he collected and spent more than seven billion dimes ‚Äî many of them from schoolchildren ‚Äî with a half-billion dollars of it going to the war on polio.\\" Publisher Gerard Piel credited O'Connor with a \\"unique social invention: a permanently self-sustaining source of funds for the support of research ‚Äî the voluntary health organization.\\" With a centralized administration, state and local chapters and a large corps of volunteers, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis became the prototype for dozens of similar foundations. The organization initially focused on the rehabilitation of victims of paralytic polio, and supported the work of Jonas Salk and others that led to the development of polio vaccines. On April 12, 1955 ‚Äì ten years after Roosevelt's death ‚Äì the National Foundation published the successful results of Salk's research on the development of a polio vaccine. After Roosevelt's death, the foundation gradually began taking care of patients with handicaps of all kinds. In 1974, the Georgia Warm Springs Foundation sold the property in Warm Springs to the State of Georgia for $1. The name was later changed to the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation. Brain trust O'Connor was a member of the so-called Brain trust that advised Roosevelt on political strategy during his 1932 Presidential campaign. O'Connor declined to join the Roosevelt administration on a formal basis, preferring the life of a lawyer. Red Cross chair Roosevelt appointed O'Connor to the American Red Cross, of which he served as chairman (1944‚Äì47) and president (1947‚Äì49). In this capacity he also chaired the League of Red Cross Societies from 1945 to 1950. O'Connor declined payment for his leadership of the Red Cross. \\"For 20 years I have gladly given over a large part of my time to charitable work, particularly to the fight against infantile paralysis sponsored by President Roosevelt,\\" O'Connor said. \\"I have never accepted or received any compansation for that work. It therefore goes without saying that I shall accept no salary as chairman of the American National Red Cross.\\" Awards Thomas M. Rivers, Charles Armstrong, John R. Paul, Thomas Francis Jr., Albert Sabin, Joseph L. Melnick, Isabel Morgan, Howard A. Howe, David Bodian, Jonas Salk, Eleanor Roosevelt and Basil O'Connor. After his activities for the Red Cross O'Connor devoted much of his time to the work in the two foundations which he presided over until his death. His efforts in fundraising were much more successful than those of other foundations. For example, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis succeeded in collecting $66.9 million in 1954 for 100,000 new patients, while in the case of about 10 million patients with heart diseases only $11.3 million were donated. In 1958 O'Connor received the Mary Woodard Lasker Award for Public Service of the Lasker Foundation in recognition of his efforts in the fight against polio. On January 2, 1958 the National Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary at Warm Springs, Georgia and Basil O'Connor was honored by having his bust inducted into the Polio Hall of Fame next to FDR and fifteen polio scientists from two centuries. The following undated quotation is attributed to Basil O'Connor: : \\"The world cannot continue to wage war like physical giants and to seek peace like intellectual pygmies.\\" Further reading * David M.

The Inspectorate is directly funded by the Scottish Government. As of July 2018, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland is Wendy Sinclair-Gieben. Origins Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland was created following a Committee of Inquiry into the prison system in the United Kingdom, whose report was published in 1979. One of the recommendations of its report was the creation of a new type of Prisons' Inspectorate, independent of the Prison Service. Previously inspections had been carried out by a Prison Governor. With the Scottish Prison Service being separate from its counterpart in England and Wales two inspectorates were created with prisons in England and Wales inspected by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons. Remit and jurisdiction Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland was placed on a statutory basis by an Act of Parliament, the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989; its functions and responsibilities are laid down accordingly. The Chief Inspector submits an annual report to the Scottish Parliament. Reports on individual prison visits are made to the Scottish Government and are subsequently published. The Scottish Ministers may also refer specific prison- related matters to the Chief Inspector for him to report on. The Inspectorate carries out a regular inspection of Scotland's prisons (including the privately run prisons). Each of Scotland's 16 prisons is normally subject to a full inspection every three years. Annual shorter, follow-up visits - which may be unannounced - are also made. Issues examinined include actual physical conditions, the quality of prisoner regimes, morale of staff and prisoners, facilities and amenities available to staff and prisoners, safety issues, and decency and contribution to reducing re-offending. The Inspectorate also inspects Legalised Police Cells (mainly used in rural parts of northern Scotland) and the conditions of prisoner escort arrangements. The Inspectorate can only make recommendations; it has no executive power to enforce these recommendations. The inspection system is identical for both the state-run and privately managed prisons. Personnel The post of HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland is full-time. It has always been a lay appointment (an individual with no previous connection with the prison service). The Chief Inspector is appointed by the Crown under section 7 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989. The Inspectorate's office is located in Edinburgh. Although the Chief Inspector is entirely independent of the Scottish Prison Service, he is assisted by two senior managers seconded from the Service. They offer professional advice and guidance in during the conduct of inspections. The Inspectorate team also includes a Scottish Government civil servant and a Personal Secretary. The Inspectorate works with other statutory Inspectorates responsible for issues such as health, education and additions.

It was organized and trained by a Spanish police mission sent to Peru at that time. It was not a detective force, investigations being carried out by the Investigative Police of Peru founded in the same year, while the old Republican Guard still had certain police missions. The Civil Guard was later renamed the General Police, which merged into the new National Police of Peru in 1988. Mission The Guardia Civil Benem√©rita Peru (now the National Police of Peru) was the corps of police that had as its mission: maintaining public order, while not requiring the use of armed force and the prevention of crimes and misdemeanors, the protection of people and their property, maintaining the free movement on public roads, vehicular traffic control, among others. Depended from the Ministry of Interior. Creation of the Civil Guard The origins of the PCG dates back to 1873, when President Don Manuel Pardo approved and signed two Supreme Decrees on December 31 of 1873 (published in the Diario Oficial \\"El Peruano\\" on January 28 of 1874) and March 23 of 1874, respectively, providing for its creation. By virtue of Supreme Decree signed on December 31 of 1873, with legislative approval made on April 3 of 1874 he formnally reorganized the police in the following manner: * ‚ÄúOrganization of the Vicinity\\", composed by the residents against criminals, by the Mayors. * ‚ÄúPolice Special Services\\", composed of the Security Police in markets and public places. * ‚ÄúPolice for Establishments\\". * ‚ÄúCountry Police\\". * ‚ÄúPrison Guards\\". * ‚ÄúPorts Police\\", regulated by the Peruvian Navy. * ‚ÄúOrganization of the permanent Public Force\\", for the preservation of public order, preventing crimes in the cities and other places nationwide. It also refers to \\"urban and rural stations and of the Regular Police Force divided into Gendarmerie and the Civil Guards, respectively\\", thus the decrees formally marked the birth of the service. That same year, Congress reported that Civil Guards units would commence their duties in every part of the nation. On November 9 of 1874, President Don Manuel Pardo Lavalle opened the Civil Guard Instruction School which was formed by a company of 50 men in the basis of the Battalion of Infantry Gendarms of Lima, its first cadets. During the War of the Pacific, the Civil Guard had a notable performance fighting alongside the Peruvian Army and it was in the victorious Battle of Tarapac√° where one of its officers took part whose work was critical to the Army which obtained the victory in such actions. Guards Subinpsector Mariano Santos Mateos, the brave Guardsman of Tarapac√°, was then assigned to the 25th (Civil Guard) Infantry Battalion \\"Guards of Arequipa\\", composed of 6 Civil Guard companies, and managed to capture, in the battle, the regimental Colonela (flag) of the \\"2nd Line\\" Infantry Regiment of the Chilean Army in the name of the nation, was after the victory in that batlle being congratulated for his heroic action and was promoted to the next higher rank of Guards Inspector. All through the course of the war, the Civil Guard, then a part of the Ministry of War, fought in all the battles of the conflict.  Ranks of the Peruvian Civil Guard until 1919  * Corneta (Cornet) * Guardia de segunda clase (Guardsman 2nd Class) * Guardia de primera clase (Guardsman 1st Class) * Subinspector de Guardias (Guards Subinspector) * Inspector de Guardias (Guards Inspector) * Mayor de Guardias (Guards Major) * Comandante de Guardias (Guards Commander) * Comisario Jefe (Chief Commissioner) Reorganization The formation of the former police lasted until 1919, the year in the second government of Don Augusto Bernardino Legu√≠a Salcedo decided to reorganize through a Legislative Decree No. 1163 issued on August 7 of 1919 the existing police forces of the Republic of Peru. Among other things that said decree provided for the establishment of \\"a school for aspiring police officers and individuals in the institution.\\" As the purpose of President Legu√≠a, inspired by the example of the Merited Spanish Civil Guard, was to reinvent the public security forces towards the changing security situation in the country, the government of His Catholic Majesty the King of Spain Don Alfonso XIII was formally requested for full assistance in the modernization and reorganization of the police forces, sending to the capital of Peru on a Spanish police mission to organize and instruct for Peru a modern and capable police service from veterans of the old Civil Guard and the remainder of what was then the National Gendarmerie. Legu√≠a through Supreme Resolution of April 4 of 1921 formally assigned for this mission selected policemen from the Spanish Civil Guard which was formally raised, and later signed up in Madrid on October 1 of 1921, the diplomatic settlement for the reformation of the police forces, which materialized into a Merited Mission of the Civil Guard, which on November 22 of 1921 arrived in Lima and was chaired by then Lieutenant Colonel Pedro Pueyo, SCG. Completing the mission were Captain Bernardo Sanchez Visaires, SCG and Lieutenant Adolfo Parre√±o Carretero, SCG, who due to illness had to return to Spain, and was replaced by the same class of Lieutenant Fernando Gomez Ayau and SFC Mr Jos√© G√≥mez Hern√°ndez, SCG (First Guard instructor). After arriving and having been received by the President, the mission went to work planning and formulation of projects for the reform of the police forces, delivering within a month of their arrival, the documentation on January 21 of 1922, having presented to the President Legu√≠a and the Minister for Police 14 bills that comprise the complete plan of reorganization of the state security forces were by then a topic of discussion in the National Congress. This study was approved no less than the President himself, who considered the plan proposed in the 14 projects mentioned, in order for the development of the national economy and to improve the security situation. As a result: * The Civil Guard Charter for Peru was framed, similar to that used by the Spanish Civil Guard, with its 1st article stating Honor is the principal emblem of the Civil Guard, a distinction that must never be hurt, for when it is done it will never be repaired, and formalizing the proposals of the Spanish military mission to make it a uniformed, independent service away from the Armed Forces and the War Ministry and as part of the Police Ministry, but will keep its military form and traditions * The wartime role would be to reinforce the Armed Forces in the defense of the nation, also as stated in the Charter * The peacetime role of the CG would be for public security in rural communities, customs and port security, highway patrol, and border security and defense among others, also as stated in the Charter * The GC abbreviation, the same one used in Spain, will be formally adopted by the new service Creation of the School of Police of the Republic As a result of work carried out by the Spanish Police Mission, the government issued on July 3, 1922, a Supreme Decree stipulating in its operative part the creation of the \\"School of the Civil Guard and Police of the Republic. The purpose of the decree was as follows: *to organize a Civil Guard Corps similar to the Meritorious Civil Guard of Spain on the basis of the remaining personnel of the National Gendarmerie *Also to form another Corps called the Security and Public Order Corps on the basis of the old Town and Country Civil Guards (the new Civil Guards formed from the Gendarmerie would carry on their tradition) * and as well as to establish another Corps called as the Investigation and Surveillance Unit, with the profitable elements of the Investigations Section of the Police Administration and first sergeants, graduates of the Army, or of the same who served as commissioned officers in the existing Gendarmerie who served in these duties of criminal investigation. Formerly the national security services served as an auxiliary of the Peruvian Armed Forces, especially during wartime, and all officers had to be graduates of the Chorillos Military School to become officers of the services. The School of Police of the Republic initially consisted of three sections namely: * 1st Senior Officers * 2nd, Junior Officers and Officer Cadets * 3rd, Special Section for Aspiring personnel of Investigation and Surveillance and its fingerprinting annex. After the creation of the School of Police and Civil Guard due to the Supreme Decree of July 3, 1922, there were first and a very careful recruitment of qualified personnel for the installation of the campus, getting the nomination very honorable and excellent military history for the kind of Captains, Lieutenants and Ensigns to be commissioned. Class sections for security and investigation were met with great care to conduct background and education and to that extent that every cadet's qualifications were met. The location chosen for the State Police Academy was the former Hospice of Mercy Hospital, 796 Sebastian Lorente Ib√°√±ez Avenue (Avenue of the Incas before) in the traditional district of Cercado, which was renovated days after the decree took effect. The academy officially opened its doors on November 1 the very same year. The opening was presided over by President Legu√≠a, together with government officials, the diplomatic corps, and military officials and attaches attending. The Spanish community of Lima also graced the event and the Spanish mission chief, LTCOL Pedro Pueyo y Espa√±a, SCG, entrusted the State War Color to the academy as its director after it was blessed officially by military chaplains and handed over to the President. It was followed by the oath-taking of the first cadets of the academy. A plaque was unveiled by the presiding officers to commemorate the occasion of its formal opening, and the first Corps of Cadets performed its first march past. As part of the opening a giant sign was made in the school entrance with the words of the Civil Guard motto, El honor es su divisa como la madre patria (Honor is its emblem with the mother country), made by no less than President Legu√≠a himself who adapted to Peru the Spanish Civil Guard motto. Classes commenced on November 4, 1922 and its first graduation and passing out parade was held on Sept. 3, 1923, for the first of what became 59 graduating classes of officers. The strength of the first class of graduates from the Police Academy, addressed to the Commissioners for Lima, constituted the State Security Corps and the first Corps of Cadets were made up of * 30 Peruvian Army Officer Cadets * 104 Officer and NCO Cadets * 19 Technical Cadets of the course of Investigation  Growth and progress of the Civil Guard  Thanks to the Spanish mission to Peru of the Spanish Civil Guard the nation had professional civil security forces for the first time. The brand new uniforms of the Civil Guard and the Security Corps reflected the effects of that mission: While the new Civil Guard kept the kepis with their dress beige uniforms Security Corps personnel wore peaked caps with their dress and duty blue uniforms. Civil Guards were also distinguished by the very same items Peruvian Army cavalry officers used then in their uniforms while the Security Corps uniforms were modeled on those worn by European police services of the period. Police organization in the rural and urban areas then were different from each other. Rural organization of the Civil Guard was on posts, lines, sectors, commands and regions while Security Corps' urban organization mirrored military organization save that, instead of companies, commissaries were the basic unit. The new SSC's first commisariat, the Monserrate Commissariat, was formally created. The cavalry was formed under the name of the Cavalry Squadron of Provincial Security, which was organized on the basis of the Gendarmerie's Cavalry Squadron \\"Lima Guard\\" at the \\"Quinta de Presa\\" Barracks, one of the new mounted police units to be raised as part of the now reorganized Civil Guard. Two more were later raised, but all were disbanded in 1923 and converted to instruction squadrons in the Police Academy. The 1st Gendarme Cavalry Squadron, at the same time, became the mounted component of the 1st Combined Arms (Cavalry and Infantry) Security Regiment, and the Gendarmerie Provincial Cavalry Squadron became the Provincial Security Cavalry Squadron. On February 22, 1924, President Augusto B. Legu√≠a, via a Supreme Resolution from the Cabinet, formally raised a Machine Gun Battalion to reinforce the ranks of the Security Corps to fulfill its mandate of public order, with Major Teodosio Alejandro Sol√≠s as its first battalion commander. The baptism of fire for the new Security Corps came with the death of two personnel from the service on May 26, 1924, while on a routine mission in Villa de Olaya. The two who died were Guardsman Nazario Tapia and Corporal Miguel Gutarra Herrera, a member of the 1st ever graduating class of 1923. The August 18, 1924 decree established the 1st Joint Command of the Civil Guard, with an Infantry Battalion, composed of two companies, and a Cavalry Squadron (formed on the basis of the former mounted police). Its duties began the same month, with its first personnel enlisted in 1925, detached from the two Civil Guards infantry companies' headquarters to the San Lazaro Barracks located at Matamoros Street, in the Rimac and the Cavalry Squadron's headquarters would be at Conchucos in the Barrios Altos, Lima, headquarters that the coming years would become the headquarters of the Cavalry Squadron of the Police and Civil Guard Guardsman's School until the end of 1965 when they moved to the Civil Guard Instruction Center (now the National Police Officer's School) Mariano Santos in the district of La Campi√±a, Chorrillos. The 1st Command would move to new quarters on 1644 28 July Avenue on January 16, 1937. The Civil Guard Second Command, the customs police arm of the Civil Guard, would be raised on August 1, 1925, by virtue of a Supreme Decree. Its baptism of fire came in 1927 while fighting the forces of local rebel Eleodoro Benel Zuloeta in Cutervo Province and later while fighting warlords in Cajamarca. Due to this and other actions the Civil Guard size was increased and 3 independent companies had to be raised as a result. A presidential decree of March 28, 1928 established August 30 every year as Police Day. Its first observance was marked by a grand parade in Lima's outskirts by all the participating units. Law No.6183 enacted on April 23, 1928 formally declared the status of the police forces, the Civil Guard included, as paramilitary units under the control and supervision of the Ministry of Government and Police with military traditions but with functions more akin to civil police services. On January 14, 1929 the Traffic Battalion was created, a merit of Act No. 6468, to control traffic in the Capital of Peru, with Major Edilberto Salazar Castillo as its first chief. The service was started in November of that year. Legu√≠a reorganized the Corps of Security Forces of the Republic by virtue of Supreme Decree of March 17, 1930, with the autonomy of the role of cavalry in the Police Cavalry Squadron recognized and the Provincial Security and Lima Security Squadrons, thus by merger, became the First Cavalry Security Regt., moving the entire cavalry unit from the \\"Quinta de Presa\\" base to the Barracks \\"El Potao\\", approving Col. Rufino Manuel Martinez Martinez, CG's appointment as Head of the First Infantry Regiment of Security and appointing Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Pella C√°ceda, CG, as First commander of the First Cavalry Regiment based at the Security Headquarters \\"El Potao.\\" Subsequently, the First Security Infantry Regiment, consisting of battalions, was raised, which in turn merged with the Commissioners for Lima. Then, these units were spread throughout Peru, with the names of the Security Battalions of the North, Central and South, with offices in Trujillo, Arequipa and La Oroya respectively. That same year, in 1930, the Machine Gun Battalion, mechanized that very same year, was forced to stand down. 1931 saw the Civil Guard involved in a rebellion by the 4th Army Division of the Peruvian Army led by LTCOL Agust√≠n Cabrera in Cusco on the 26th of June. After forcing the surrender of the 4th Artillery Regiment the rebel division marched towards the CG station and the rebel leader asked the Civil Guard commander in the area, Major Humberto Flores Hidalgo to defect, but he refused, forcing the rebels to withdraw from the police station. Major Hidalgo alongside Captain Carlos Briolo forced Civil Guards units in the area to counterattack the rebel movement and worked with opponents of the movement to stop it in its tracks. The result was that most of the rebels defected and forced the capture of the rebel commander on July 6‚Äì7. The American Popular Revolutionary Alliance rebellion of July 7, 1932 in Trujillo, Peru surprised the services. As part of the forces responding to the revolution in that city, both the Civil Guard and the Security Corps excelled well and contributed to the victory at the cost of 36 dead and 15 wounded at the part of both services. This was the first time both services fought alongside the Peruvian Armed Forces in a joint service operation. In their honor and of all others who died while in service, a memorial cenotaph was opened in the Police and Civil Guard Academy courtyard in the following month. With the reform of the January 5th of 1944 the Civil Guards Corps and Security Corps were merged into one body called the Peruvian Civil Guard. Under a government mandate that the service responsible for providing services in the towns and cities of the nation, the corps was divided accordingly into the Urban Civil Guard for urban municipality and city security, and the Rural Civil Guard for rural security services. Since then, the Guardia Civil of Peru was evolving face since 1980 the serious problem of subversion, increasing its strength, taking on new tasks and creating different specialties. Unification of the Police Forces President Alan Garc√≠a P√©rez, in his first term as chief executive (1985‚Äì1990), began on September 14 of 1985, under the law 24,294 of the Republic, as approved by Congress, the beginning of the reorganization of the police services of the Republic of Peru. On February 4, 1986, continuing with the project undertaken, legislative decrees 370, 371, 372, and 373 relating to the Organic Law of the Ministry of the Interior, the Police Forces Code of 1969 and the Organic Laws of the Civil Guard, Investigations Police and the Republican Guard were issued to the three forces. Among these, Legislative Decree No. 371, the \\"1986 Police Forces Act\\", formally laid the foundations for the definitive establishment of the National Police of Peru. The Act established a single command (i.e. the Directorate General of Police) and also the formation of a single study center for the preparation of police officers (in the basis of Civil Guard Instruction Center \\"Mariano Santos\\" in La Campina - Chorrillos, and to be called the National Police Officer's School) and a national school for the guards and agents (referred to National Police headquarters at the former Republican Guard Superior Institute in Puente Piedra, today the National Police Technical College), directly under the Ministry of the Interior. Law 24,949 was finally enacted on December 6 of 1988 amending the relevant articles of the Political Constitution of Peru of 1979 with the aim of the formal foundation of the National Police of Peru, and took effect the next day. The objectives sought were, among others, to integrate the three police forces to make better use of economic resources, eliminate the conflict that existed between them caused by \\"double role\\" problems and, above all, provide better services to society. With the unification of the police forces the CG became known as \\"General Police\\" (Policia General) until 1991, when all 3 commands of the National Police were abolished and a single command created in its place. Ranks and titles The police grades in the Civil Guard are the following: 1\\\\. General Officers: * Lieutenant General. * General. 2\\\\. Superior Officers: * Colonel. * Lieutenant Colonel * Major. 3\\\\. Subaltern Officers: * Captain * Lieutenant * Ensign 4\\\\.

With a population of over 10,000, it is one of 44 communes in the Aix-en-Provence arrondissement or district. It is often described as a medieval town because of its development during the Middle Ages of European history and retention of medieval architecture. Geography Trets is situated in the Upper Valley of the Arc river, between painter Paul C√©zanne's beloved Montagne Sainte-Victoire 11 km to the north and the Aur√©lien hills (Monts Aur√©liens) to the east, at the foot of Mount Olympus to the south. Population and history Archeological evidence suggests that the first inhabitants of the area, of Chass√©en culture, lived on the summit of Mount Olympus around 4000 BC, during the Neolithic period. The founding site of Trets has been described variously as a Greek colony or an ‚Äúancient Roman settlement.‚Äù By some accounts Trets was originally named Trittia or Tritea by the Phocean settlers of Massalia, in homage to the daughter of the Greek god Triton. In the later years of the Roman conquest of Provence, Gaius Marius defeated the Teutons and Ambrones ‚Äúat a spot between Saint-Maximin and Trets.‚Äù The first historical account identifying the populace now known as Trets appears in 950 AD, when the king of Burgundy and Provence Conrad the Peaceful transferred hereditary rule over the lands of the Upper Valley of the Arc as a fisc to the first Seigneur (or Lord) of Trets. A succession of lords ruled until the French Revolution of 1789. Architecture Altar of the Church of Our Lady of Nazareth. Romanesque, and gothic buildings and vaulted passageways of the medieval period line the narrow, winding streets of the town. The center of Trets was surrounded the ramparts and its 8 towers (4 left), for defense against successive invasions over the centuries. A 2200 sqm garden along the town walls (Jardins des Remparts) was opened in 2011. Several gates (porte) were opened in the city walls. The rectangular Gate of Pourri√®res and its preserved machicolations were built in the 14th century. It served as the main gateway access into town. On the East side of city, the Gate Saint-Jean also known as the Gate of Amont (14th) provides uptown access and was used to store munitions. On the North end stood the Gate of Clastre (14th), the Porte Neuve and the Gate of Puyloubier, all destroyed by the mid-19th century. Now the grounds of the Edmond Brun elementary school, a hospital named H√¥pital Saint Jacques was established circa 1300 near the church of the same patronage and later transferred, in 1794, to the Observantins convent. The low, vaulted passageway called Le Trou de Madame Lion gave access to the wall-walk. It is thought to have been either a way of confining any epidemic outbreak to the grounds of the hospital or a way of defending against mounted attacks. To the southeast is the feudal castle (Ch√¢teau des Remparts) with its staircase in dimension stone with a ramp from the 17th century, French-style painted ceilings and a baroque chimney. Its construction started in the late 12th or the early 13th century. In June 2013 a number of renovations were completed, with a modern performance space in the courtyard. The classified 14th-century Church of Our Lady of Nazareth was built upon a 4th-century priory of the Roman-Proven√ßal style with an open vaulted arch, gothic chapels, and a massive unfinished tower. Its massive altarpiece (1693) was executed by the native Christophe Veyrier in stucco and marble. La Chapelle Saint-Jean-du-Puy, a former 5th-century hermitage, features a Romanesque apse, garden sanctuary and 18th-century watch tower that is an observatory overlooking the town and the Valley of the Arc. It was rebuilt with the addition of two Gallo-Roman columns. The 14th-century papal Studium of Trets put forth what may have been the only record of its kind in the Vatican archives of that time, a register of the local economy detailing the material life of schoolchildren and their teachers. The H√¥tel de la Vall√©e de l‚ÄôArc, at the center of town, was an 18th- century relay post. Henri Raybaud executed the War memorial on the townhall square depicting an \\"angel of victory\\" . Cultural encounters and traditions The influence of both Greek and Roman cultures is said to have led to the cultivation of wine and wheat. After the Romans came the Goths, the Merovingians, the Carlovingians and the Saracens; then, after a period of viscounts of Marseille, Trets came under local papal governance through the diocese of Aix, according to the papal bull of Urban II in 1088. Holidays and festivals reflect historical encounters and traditions, including: * (May/June) La F√™te de Saint Jean has been observed since 1793. * (July) La F√™te de la Saint Eloi, patron saint of goldsmiths and blacksmiths since 659 AD, celebrates Proven√ßal culture, language and arts. * (August) Les M√©di√©vales de Trets celebrate the occasion of The Good King Ren√© welcoming his nephew Louis XI of France, with period events and dress. While the Jews were expelled from France in 1182, local governance permitted construction of a synagogue in a manor on the present-day street called Rue Paul Bert. A surrounding Jewish quarter was established by local edict in the early 14th century. In 2000, sister city exchanges were established with Aghavnadzor, Armenia.  Notable people  * Raimbaud de Reillanne, archbishop of Arles. * Raymond de Gaufredi, son of the lord Burgondion de Trets and Mabile d'Agoult, minister general of the Order of Friars Minor from 1289 to 1295. * Bertrand Bezaudun, archbishop of Genova from 1349 to 1358. * Christophe Veyrier, born in Trets on 26 January 1637, died in Toulon on 10 June 1689 (sculptor), nephew and follower of Pierre Puget. * Jean-Jacques Cl√©rion, born in Trets on 16 April 1637, died in Paris on 28 August 1714 (sculptor for Louis XIV of France). * Urbain Dubois, born in Trets on 26 May 1818, died in Nice on 14 March 1901, chef to the King of Prussia from 1860 to 1870. He published several recipe books and is credited with the invention of the Veal Orloff.

Tensions are already high among the nurses as a visiting colonel has arrived to perform a snap inspection on Major Houlihan, her nurses and their routines. During a nightshift in post-op, Hawkeye sees the error of his ways as he observes Kellye comforting a dying soldier. Hawkeye shows up at Kellye's tent dressed in a tuxedo, only to find her already on a date with the visiting colonel's aide.

Origins The Grenada Boys‚Äô Secondary School, initially known as the St. George's Grammar School officially, opened on 2 February 1885, at Mrs. Grey's premises in Hospital Street (the present location of First Caribbean International Bank on Church Street) in St. George's, with 10 male students. In 1910‚Äì11 the school was restructured and renamed Grenada Boys‚Äô Secondary School and was relocated to Melville Street at the present site of the Police Barracks. The new premises was officially opened on September 18, 1911 with an enrolment of 23 students. In May 1946 the school was relocated to Tanteen to wooden barracks, which previously housed the Windward Island battalion for World War II. The wooden barracks were destroyed by hurricane Ivan in 2004. The school experienced severe destruction from two fires in April and June 2005. The school's auditorium was refurbished, through the sponsorship of Digicel in 2005. The first phase of the new school was constructed from 2006 to 2008 by the government of Grenada funded by the World Bank. The GBSS has been mainly a boys‚Äô school but girls have also attended especially for the sixth form (A-level) years. Girls were admitted into Form I from 1982 during the reign of the Peoples‚Äô Revolutionary Government to 1987, but were phased out by 1991. The school roll is 835 male students. The faculty consists of Principal, 50 Teachers and two Counselors. The school can be found on Facebook.Grenada Boys' Secondary School on Facebook.

The camera represented one of Nikon's first endeavours into consumer-based autofocus, as a follow-up to their first autofocus SLR in 1986, the Nikon F-501 (known as the N2020 in North America). The camera lacked many of the advanced features that more seasoned amateurs and professionals required, but it was a harbinger of the future as it included a pronounced, built-in grip as well as an integrated TTL Flash that is now commonplace on all but the most high-end SLR cameras. The F-401 introduced the now common- place feature of using a thumbwheel instead of lens aperture ring to adjust the aperture. Furthermore, the camera's lack of support for AI lenses meant that while all previous Nikon lenses could be mounted to the camera, none supported automatic exposure TTL metering. By the 1990s, the F-401 was part of a lineup of autofocus consumer SLRs that included the more expensive Nikon F-601 and Nikon F-801.

It is characterized by code-words conventionally defined basing on characteristics of the thing or on onomatopoeias; other words have an unknown origin. It has been noted by Carlo Mazza, vicar of Asso, in his book Memorie storiche della Vallassina of 1796. He informs us that several slangs have been created in the time, because in the time the words were introduced in the current language, reducing the differences between \\"official\\" language and \\"secret\\" language. After a list of terms, the vicar proposes, as example, the translation of Pater Noster in this language, evidencing that it's totally incomprehensible also by the Insubric speakers. There are various similar or identical slangs in many localities of Insubria, like Valtellina and Milan. Some Spasell words have been adsorbed by the common language, for example l√≤fi (see Spasell loffi=bad), used in northern Brianza to indicate a \\"so and so\\" person, or scabbi, used also by Carlo Porta in the poem Brindes de Meneghin a l'Ostaria to refer to wine, in alternation with vin.

They collected eggs, fed the pigs, and premiered their first show to a bunkhouse full of cowboys and Hutterites. A year later, they moved to Calgary, having exhausted the joys of living in a coal-heated shack. The Trouts now travel the world, performing at festivals that celebrate the art of the extraordinary. The Old Trout Puppet Workshop is dedicated to making professional puppet theatre, for both children and adults, that blurs that distinction. The Trouts explore the outer edges of the puppet medium, and create original, unique, and exuberant art. An Old Trout show strives for delightful allegory, joyful tragedy, and purity of spirit. The company has written, designed, built and performed the following plays: Ignorance, The Erotic Anguish of Don Juan, Famous Puppet Death Scenes, The Unlikely Birth of Istvan, Beowulf, The Tooth Fairy, The Last Supper of Antonin Careme, Pinocchio, The Ice King and their most recent show Jabberwocky.

Geography Located from Aix-en-Provence, the commune of Meyreuil is sheltered in the northeast by the mountain Montagne Sainte-Victoire, and the district of Canet is separated from the chief town by the river Arc. Meyreuil is composed of three principal districts: Meyreuil village includes the town hall, the church and the cemetery. Nestled on the hillside, the old village is very peaceful. The Plan of Meyreuil, where the majority of the trade, the post office or the media library are located, is the economic center of the commune. Canet, situated on RN7 (the road between Paris and Nice) has always been a transportation hub. Formerly the location of two stagecoach stops, Canet today includes many hotels and restaurants, as well as a technology park . History The name of Meyreuil comes from that of the Roman General Marius, who fought a battle against the Ambrones and the Teutons near Aix in 102 B.C. The village was successively called MIROIL (1098), MAIROL or MAIROIL in 1154, MEROLIO in 1259, MAREUIL to the 13th, 14th, 15th centuries, MAROLIUM and MEROLIUM in 1529, MERUEIL in 1634, MEIRUEILH in 1663, MEYRUEIL in 1766. The current name of MEYREUIL is at most 200 years old. In the 15th century, it belonged to Guillaume de Littera (1371-1452).Aix-en- Provence Historical Society: Guillaume de Littera Contemporary history Laurent Chazal, the mayor of the commune for 34 years, died on May 29, 2005. Robert Lagier succeeded Chazal as a result of the elections of July 3 and July 10, 2005. La Belle du Canet A memorable figure in the history of Canet, la Belle du Canet was Lucr√®ce de Forbin-Solli√®s, widow of Henri de Rascas, lord of Canet and first Consul of Aix. She became the mistress of the Duke Louis de Vend√¥me, himself a widower. His deceased wife was Laure Mancini, niece of the Jules Cardinal Mazarin. Louis XIV, under pretext that they were both widowed (and, undoubtedly, for other more political reasons), opposed their marriage and had the Duke named as a Cardinal. This did not prevent the two lovers from being together. The Duke of Vend√¥me who lived in Aix-en- Provence at Cours Mirabeau, had a country house built, the Pavillon Vend√¥me, to meet his beloved who took care to disguise herself. The peasants of the suburb where the house was built called these disguised people the \\"machouettos\\". It is there that the Duke died Tuesday August 6, 1669, at only 57 years of age.

It is used as a cheaper and more versatile alternative to the SR-3 \\"Vikhr\\". The 9A-91 is a gas operated, rotating bolt weapon, which utilizes a long stroke gas piston, located above the barrel, and a rotating bolt with 4 lugs. The receiver is made from steel stampings; the forend and pistol grip are made from polymer. The steel buttstock folds up and above the receiver when not in use. The charging handle is welded to the right side of bolt carrier on earlier production guns with current production guns having a charging hand that folds up, making the gun more low profile by decreasing the chances of the charging handle snagging onto articles of clothing and equipment. Earlier production models of the 9A-91 featured the safety / fire selector lever at the left side of the receiver, above the trigger guard. Current production models feature the safety / fire selector lever at the right side and a sight mounting rail on the left side of the receiver. This allows the user to attach various scopes and red-dots onto the rail to aid in aiming the weapon. The fire selector allows for semi- and full-automatic fire. The flip-up rear sight has settings for 100 and 200 meters range, but the relatively short sight base and steep trajectory of the subsonic bullet effectively restricts the 9A91 to ranges of about 100 meters.

Established by General Elijah Clarke in May 1794, it was an attempt to head off the new Federal government's ceding of lands claimed by Georgia back to the Creek. In September 1794, state and federal troops forced Clarke and his followers to surrender and leave the settlements. The armed forces destroyed the houses and forts. Background In February 1794, General Elijah Clarke, a popular veteran of the American Revolutionary War, resigned his current commission in the Georgia state militia in order to lead an expedition against the East Florida colony. Clarke had become involved in a French-supported scheme to invade East Florida, which was then controlled by the Kingdom of Spain. When the invasion failed to develop, General Clarke and several hundred of his followers moved instead to establish an independent state west of the Oconee River --on hunting grounds reserved by the federal Treaty of New York (1790) exclusively for the Creek Indians. Georgia had not been consulted on the original treaty --which included giving titled lands back to the Creek. Many European American settlers in Georgia resented the treaty because they saw it as limiting the possibilities for the future expansion of their state.George R. Lamplugh, Politics on the Periphery: Factions and Parties in Georgia, 1783-1806, Newark, University of Delaware Press, 1986, pp. 64-68, accessed 19 Nov 2010 Clarke's frontiersmen made settlements on lands in present-day Greene, Morgan, Putnam, and Baldwin counties of Georgia. The settlers built several towns and forts over the next few months. They also wrote and ratified their own constitution, indicating the permanent intention of their endeavor. With little overt opposition from the Creek, they were taking control of the lands before the state or federal governments could react.Christopher J. Floyd, \\"Trans-Oconee Republic\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia, 2004-2010, accessed 19 Nov 2010 Conflict with the Federal government The United States government viewed Clarke's actions as a violation of the Treaty of New York, which provided recognition of Creek lands in an effort to maintain peace and guarantee their neutrality. President George Washington pressured the Georgia Governor, George Mathews, to remove the illegal settlers from the Creek lands. Mathews initially ignored the \\"unauthorized military expedition,\\" because he shared the state's resentment of the treaty and was well aware of Clarke's popularity as a hero of the Revolution. He took only token measures to stop Clarke and his party, such as issuing a proclamation in July 1794 that went unenforced. It is unlikely that Mathews had enough public support to move against Clarke at that juncture, but the tide of public opinion eventually changed. In late August, Judge George Walton issued a charge to an Augusta grand jury in which he condemned the actions of Clarke and his followers, and explained that they constituted a threat to the state and federal powers. He said Clarke and his followers were attempting to steal the western lands, \\"the richest jewel the state of Georgia possesses,\\" before other Georgians had a fair chance to acquire title to them by legal state action. (Clarke had welcomed settlers to join the enterprise, intending to take control of the land from the Creek before the state and federal government could react. He had forbidden issuing large tracts of the land in the new republic to speculators or other investors who would not settle there.) In any case, Walton's charges changed public opinion to a degree that allowed the Governor to muster a sufficient force of militia to march against Clarke. In September, 1,200 Georgia militiamen, led by General Jared Irwin acting in conjunction with federal troops stationed on the Oconee, surrounded and isolated General Clarke's fortifications. After some negotiation, Clarke agreed to surrender, provided that he and his men would not face prosecution for their actions. Clarke and his followers departed, and the militia burned down the new settlements and fortifications. Legacy Clarke's establishing of the illegal settlements coincided with increasing interest in the state in the disposition of Georgia's western land claims, which at that time stretched as far as the Mississippi River. From 1785 on, speculators from other states had lobbied hard to encourage the sale of lands and extinguish Creek and other Indian land claims, despite their guarantee by federal treaty. In late 1794, the Georgia General Assembly passed a bill allowing a portion of the lands west of the Oconee River, the same land which Clarke's followers had recently occupied, to be distributed among veterans of the Revolution and various Indian conflicts. A supplementary act (the Yazoo Act) attached to the bill provided for the sale of of western land to four private land speculation firms: the Georgia Company, the Georgia- Mississippi Company, the Upper Mississippi Company, and the new Tennessee Company, persuaded the Georgia state assembly to sell more than . As many of the firms' members included many political insiders, the whole enterprise was scandalous and came to be known as the Yazoo Land Fraud.

The current Grand Master of the Order is Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, the Head of the House of Braganza.  History  The order was created by King John VI of Portugal in Rio de Janeiro on 6 February 1818, the date of his acclamation, in recognition for the efficient protection of the Kingdom's Spiritual Sovereign (Portugal is known as the Land of Santa Maria since its foundation). The Blessed Virgin Mother under the invocation of the Immmaculate Conception (venerated in the Ducal Chapel of the Palace of Vila Vi√ßosa) had earlier been acclaimed \\"Queen\\" and Patroness of the kingdom by King John IV on March 25, 1646 following a referendum of the Empire that lasted 6 years and asked subjects: 1. If they believed the Blessed Virgin Mary to have been conceived without sin, and 2. If they believed that the Blessed Virgin Mary was the physical reigning Queen of Portugal and not just symbolically the Patroness. The people answered affirmatively and since the Coronation that took place at Vila Vi√ßosa, the Kings of Portugal never again wore a crown. This order distinguished those who proved their loyalty to the Portuguese Royal House in the war against the Bonapartist occupying forces. Later, in 1818, a royal decree stated that the Order would be given as a military award in four (4) classes of Grand Cross, Commander, Knight, and Servant. Knighthood was given to those who were servants to the king and devoted Catholics to the pope and the Holy Mother. The Order was originally limited to twelve Grand Crosses, forty Commanders and one hundred Knights, with the provision for the award of supernumerary Grand Crosses. Grand Crosses were usually given to higher nobles who had positions in the Royal Household. Lower grades (Commander and below) were granted to lesser nobles who had provided personal service to the King. Unlike the earlier Religious-Military Orders, the Order of Christ, the Order of St. Benedict of Aviz, and the Order of St. James of the Sword, Vila Vi√ßosa was more aligned to the Order of the Tower and Sword which had been re- established by King John VI. Late into the 19th century, the constitutional sovereigns were inclined to treat the Order of Vila Vi√ßosa as the paramount award given by the sovereign for services rendered to the Royal House. In 1910, a revolution installed a Republican government that took over all State Orders except the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa; as a result, King Manuel II of Portugal in exile and, after his death, the Dukes of Braganza continued to use the order's insignia and to bestow it as they considered the Order to belong to their dynasty rather than the state. Just after the Second World War, it was bestowed on Prime Minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar by Queen Amelia when she visited Portugal for the last time. In December 1983, Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, re-activated the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa, and maintains it as an honorific order of the Portuguese Royal Family. He has since then distinguished many Portuguese personalities (including giving the Order's Medal of Merit to among them football star Cristiano Ronaldo). Organisation Ducal Palace of Vila Vi√ßosa The order is primarily bestowed upon Portuguese nobles, and only occasionally out of protocol on Heads of State and Royal Houses, but has also been bestowed (before 2005) on foreign and Portuguese recipients who received it solely as an honorary award for services rendered to the expansion of the Cult of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Message of Our Lady of F√°tima, or the Roman Catholic Church, but who are not listed as active members of the Portuguese order and therefore not invited to attend functions or events organised by the order. The order is unofficially acknowledged by the Portuguese government. It may be worn by Portuguese citizens, but not on Portuguese military uniforms. Honorary members are not expected to contribute with yearly dues or contributions, although they may wear the decorations at public events if they solicit and obtain permission beforehand to do so from the Secretariat of the Royal House. Grades The Order is divided in four grades: * Grand-Cross (GCNSC) * Commander (ComNSC) * Knight/ Dame (CvNSC / DmNSC) * Servent (SNSC)  Insignia  Breast Star of the Grand Cross and sash insignia of the Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Vi√ßosa The order's insignia was designed by the French painter Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768‚Äì1848), who was in charge of creating in Rio de Janeiro an arts and crafts lyceum (Escola Real de Artes e Of√≠cios) under the auspices of King Jo√£o VI and the Marquis of Marialva. The order's sash is light blue and white. The medallion is starshaped and crowned, and in it center has a monogram with the letters \\"AM\\".

Instone & Company Limited, a shipping company set up by Sir Samuel Instone, had operated a private air service from Cardiff via London's Hounslow Heath Aerodrome to Le Bourget aerodrome, near Paris, since 1919. From April 1920 it ran the service between London and Paris as a public service using the name Instone Air Line. In 1920 it was the first airline to transport a racehorse and on 1 January 1922 the company introduced uniforms to its pilots and staff; possibly the first airline to do so. It started a London to Cologne (Butzweilerhof) service in May 1922. It stopped operating the London-Paris route in October 1922 due to competition. In 1923, a Government committee recommended that the main British airlines should merge, to establish one, financially strong, airline, and to enable it to undertake the necessary expansions.

Geography The municipality counts 13 villages (Ortsteil): Blandikow, Blesendorf, Blumenthal, Grabow bei Blumenthal, Herzsprung, Jabel, K√∂nigsberg, Liebenthal, Maulbeerwalde, Papenbruch, Rosenwinkel, Wernikow and Zaatzke. Architecture Herb garden, Convent building and Blood Chapel Abbey Heiligengrabe Abbey (literally in ; formerly also known as Techow) was founded here as a Cistercian nunnery in 1289 by Heinrich, Bishop of Havelberg and the Margrave Otto of Brandenburg, initially for 12 nuns. It held an important relic in the form of a Bleeding Host which, so it was said, had been violated in a host desecration by a Jew. The nunnery acquired considerable wealth and estates in the area, partly through the revenue from pilgrims to the Bleeding Host, and partly through donations from the noble families round about, especially when one of their daughters entered the convent. Among the nuns of local great houses were members of the families Gans zu Putlitz, von Quitzow, von Rohr, von Winterfeld and von Blumenthal. Some of the abbesses were great characters. The Abbess Henriette von Winterfeldt had a quarrel with the Duke of Mecklenburg, who refused to pay a debt to the abbey. So she borrowed a large artillery piece and declared war on Mecklenburg, bombarding it across the nearby frontier. At the time of the Lutheran Reformation, Abbess Anna von Quitzow would have nothing to do with the new denomination, and refused to pay tax. After the Reformation the prior function of the nunnery, to provide sustenance for unmarried women mostly from local noble families, wasn't to be given up with its secularisation. So the formerly Roman Catholic nunnery turned into a Lutheran women's convent (, more particular: Damenstift , literally in ), with its conventuals now called secular canonesses (Stiftsdamen). The canonesses of nobility were obliged to show sixteen quarterings in their arms before being permitted to enter.

It is lined with shops, businesses, and restaurants. It joins with Ben Yehuda Street and King George Street to form the Downtown Triangle central business district. Major landmarks along Jaffa Road are Tzahal Square (IDF square), Safra Square (city hall), Zion Square, Davidka Square, the triple intersection (Hameshulash) at King George V Street and Straus Street, the Ben Yehuda Street pedestrian mall, the Mahane Yehuda market, and the Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Jaffa Road has been redeveloped as a car-free pedestrian mall served by the Jerusalem Light Rail.  History  Originally paved in 1861 as part of the highway to Jaffa, the road quickly became a focal point for the 19th century expansion out of Jerusalem's Old City walls, and early neighbourhoods like the Russian Compound, Nahalat Shiva, and Mahane Yehuda blossomed around it, as well as Shaare Zedek hospital. Proximity to the artery quickly became a measure of real-estate value in the booming city. Traffic originally consisted of camels and mules, and the route was eventually improved enough to allow for horse- drawn carriages. The German Templers, who established the German Colony, first began a regular carriage service along the road to Jaffa. Jaffa Road after 1907 During the period of the British Mandate, the street was further developed with the establishment of many central institutions including the city hall, the city's central post office, the Anglo-Palestine Bank, and the Generali office building. The buildings on its easternmost end constructed along the Old City walls were destroyed in July 1944 so as not to obscure the city's historic view. During this period the street took on its modern shape, and it became the heart of the city's developing central business district as most commerce left the Old City. During the city's 19-year division between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which separated the Old City from much of modern Jerusalem, Jaffa Road's primacy as the city-centre was unchallenged. The Jerusalem Municipality, Jerusalem's main post office, the Mahane Yehuda Market are located on Jaffa Road. As a bustling thoroughfare, it has been targeted by terrorist groups and some of the most devastating terrorist attacks from the late 1960s onward have been carried out on this street, among them the Zion Square refrigerator bombing and the Sbarro pizza bombing. For much of its hundred-year existence, Jaffa Road has served as Jerusalem's central artery. The municipality responded to problems in the struggling city-centre through focused efforts to redevelop the street; Jaffa Road was limited to public transit (buses and taxis) in an attempt to divert traffic congestion from the area, and became the centrepiece of a new development plan for revitalising the downtown. A tunnel was excavated under the street at Tzahal Square in 2004 to allow the city's central north-south route to bypass it. In order to accommodate the new system, new utility lines were laid under one side of the road, which was also widened. 180 properties were evacuated to allow for the road's improvement. The Jerusalem Light Rail began operating in 2011. At the western end of Jaffa Road, opposite the Central Bus Station, it passes over Jaffa Road via Santiago Calatrava's Chords Bridge, which serves as an architectural beacon for the area.

Don't let your guard down, though, because there are some cruelly well executed set-pieces that are enrobed in a constant sense of dread.\\" AllMovie gave the film a generally negative review, writing, \\"this feels like an Argento retread ‚Äì the murder mystery recalls his 1971 Cat o' Nine Tails a little too much, and the overly familiar horrific elements (pace, editing, music, screaming) have little impact.\\"  Release  The film was first released in cinemas in its native country of Italy on 5 January 2001. Later that year, Sleepless was released in the United States in limited theaters on 24 August 2001 from Artisan Entertainment before shortly being released on home video formats in the winter.  Alternate versions  The original US video release from Artisan Entertainment was heavily edited for content. Every murder sequence in the film was trimmed down for less graphic violence, including the decapitation murder of the ballet dancer which omits the image of the head hitting the floor. In all over a minute worth of footage was cut. A US DVD was also put out by Arisan of an unrated and fully uncut version with all the gore intact. European DVD releases of the film are completely uncut. The German 2013 Blu-ray edition is heavily censored, nearly three minutes shorter than the director's cut.

It is one of the Fair Youth sequence, and the first of the mini-sequence known as the Rival Poet sonnets, thought to be composed some time from 1598 to 1600. Exegesis Invoking the youth as his muse, the speaker finds, has helped his poetry by providing direct inspiration, and this perhaps also refers to the help provided through patronage. The speaker notes that other poets have appropriated his way of invoking the young man, and this has helped them distribute their poetry, perhaps by being published, or by otherwise finding readers. The poet's strategy in this sonnet is to portray himself as ignorant and lacking in talent, but the second quatrain in lines 5 and 6 introduces sarcastic mock humility, by the ridiculousness of the image of croaking (\\"taught the dumb on high to sing\\"), paired with the image of heavy objects flying about (\\"heavy ignorance aloft to fly\\"). This is followed by the hyperbole of young men adding double majesty to grace. The poet encourages the youth to appreciate his work more, because the youth has wholly inspired the poet's works, and this primacy of his invocation has elevated him to the level of the most learned.Shakespeare, William. Duncan-Jones, Katherine. Shakespeare‚Äôs Sonnets. Bloomsbury Arden 2010. p. 262 .Hammond, Gerald. The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets. Barnes & Noble. 1981. p. 98-99. Structure Sonnet 78 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the rhyme scheme, abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter, a metre based on five feet in each line, and two syllables in each foot, accented weak/strong. Most of the lines are regular iambic pentameter, including the 5th line: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing (78.5) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. Analysis According to Helen Vendler, \\"Shakespeare excels in a form of verbal emphasis pointing up the conceptual oppositions of his verse.\\" In this first poem of the Rival Poet sequence, \\"a firm antithesis is drawn between the putatively rude speaker and the other poets clustered round the young man.\\" They are all \\"learned\\" and practicing both art and style, while \\"the poor speaker's ignorance is twice insisted on, as is his muteness (he was dumb) before he saw the young man.\\"Vendler, Helen Hennessy. \\"78.\\" The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge, MA: Belknap of Harvard UP, 1998. 351. Print. The poem gives us directions as to how we should read it and which words we should emphasize: \\"The words of the couplet tie ‚Äî art, high, learning [learn√®d], ignorance ‚Äî repeat in little the topics that are under dispute.\\" Michael Schoenfeldt notes, \\"the more whimsical complimentary sonnets, such as 78‚Ä¶ such sonnets may be fanciful, but they are not frivolous‚Ä¶ Read from the right angle, so to speak, they can be very beautiful, or at least delightful; and in them, as elsewhere Shakespeare is inventing some game or other and playing it out to its conclusion in deft and surprising ways.\\"Strategies of Unfolding.\\" Compassion to Shakespeare Sonnets. Ed. Michael Schoenfeldt. Malden: Blackwell Pub, 2007. 38. Print. The words \\"pen\\", \\"feather\\", and \\"style\\" ‚Äî used in stanza 1, 2, and 3 respectively ‚Äî seem to be related. The word \\"pen\\" derives from the Latin word penna meaning feather, and in the Renaissance referred to a quill pen, and also was occasionally used to indicate a \\"feather\\". The word \\"style\\" in line 11 means a writer's literary style, though it also could be used as a synonym for \\"pen\\"; it derives from the Latin stilus meaning a writing instrument.Booth, Stephen. \\"Sonnet 78.\\" Shakespeare's Sonnets: Edited with Anaylitic Commentary. Westford: Murray, 1977. Print \\"Dumb\\", \\"ignorance\\", \\"learned‚Äòs\\", and \\"grace\\" are nouns that occur in the second stanza. The words \\"dumb\\" and \\"ignorance\\" could indicate the poet. \\"Learned\\" and \\"grace\\" could indicate a particular rival. In line 7, the poet uses a \\"metaphor from falconry and refers to the practice of imping, engrafting extra feathers in the wing of a bird\\" in order to improve the health and flight of the bird. There are Italian allusions in Sonnet 78. For example, the phrase \\"penna d'ingegno\\" in Petrarch's sonnet 307, which means ‚Äúpen of genius‚Äù, is analogous to Shakespeare's phrase ‚Äúlearned's wing‚Äù. The reference to falconry is often noted, but not the reference to Petrarch's sonnet.Eriksen, Roy T. \\"Extant And In Choice Italian: Possible Italian Echoes In Julius Caesar And Sonnet 78.\\" English Studies 69.3 (1988): 224. Academic Search Complete. Web. 6 Feb. 2012.Eriksen, Roy T. \\"Extant And In Choice Italian: Possible Italian Echoes In Julius Caesar And Sonnet 78.\\" English Studies 69.3 (1988): 224. Academic Search Complete. Web. 6 Feb. 2012. In line 12's \\"graces\\" and \\"graced\\", Shakespeare uses a stylistic figure known as polyptoton ‚Äì the use of words that share the same root. The figure here occurs as a demonstration of what is stated in line 8. In line 13's phrase \\"thou art all my art\\" Shakespeare uses a rhetorical device known as antanaclasis, in which a word is used twice in different senses. The effect of the antanaclasis works as a metaphor for the basic meaning of the clause: \\"the beloved's being and the speaker's art are one and the same thing\\". Joel Fineman suggests an alternative interpretation: \\"Instead of 'thou art all my art', writing itself stands ‚Äî not subtly, but explictiy ‚Äîbetween the poet's first and second persons. Writing itself (the same writing written by \\"I\\" the poet and by the \\"thou\\" of the young man) gives the poet an ontological and poetic art of interference whose transference both is and is not what it is supposed to be\\"Fineman, Joel. Shakespeare's Perjured Eye: The Invention of Poetic Subjectivity in the Sonnets. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986 Context Sonnet 78 we find out about a rival who's male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86.Pequigney, Joseph. \\"Jealous Thoughts.\\" Such Is My Love: A Study of Shakespeare Sonnets. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1985. 103+. Print. The rivalry between the poets may appear to be literary, but, according to the critic Joseph Pequigney, it is in reality a sexual rivalry. This is disturbing because the subject in the sonnet is one that the persona has found erotically profitable, in part because the other poet may be superior in learning and style. Shakespeare is not concerned with poetic triumph he is vying only for the prize of a fair friend. The combat between the two rivals is indirect and the speaker never addresses his literary adversary and only mentions his beloved. It is the body language of Sonnet 78 (the first in the series) 79, 80 and 84 that serves to convert the topic of letters into that of eroticism. Shakespeare is known for his usage of puns and double meaning on words. So it isn't surprising that he uses wordplay in the first quatrain on \\"pen\\" for the male appendage, or, as a Stein-cum-Joyce might say, \\"a pen is a penis a pen,\\" is fully utilized. The poet remarks at 78.4, \\"every alien pen hath got my use,\\" where \\"alien\\" = 'of a stranger' and \\"use,\\" besides 'literary practice,' can = 'carnal enjoyment.' These sexual allusions are made in passing; they are overtones, restricted to a line or two. Debate in Sonnet 78 In Sonnet 78, Shakespeare has a mock debate between the young man and himself: \\"The mock-debate of the sonnet is: should the young man be prouder of Shakespeare's poem compiled out of rude ignorance, or of those of his more learned admirers?\\" This question is followed by a mock answer: \\"The mock answer is that the young man should be prouder of having taught a hitherto dumb admirer to sing, and of having advanced ignorance as high as learning, because these achievements on his part testify more impressively to his originally power than his (slighter) accomplishments with respect to his learned poets ‚Äî he but mends their style and graces their arts.\\" The debate that Shakespeare presents is \\"in a Petrarchan logical structure, with a clearly demarcated octave and sestet.\\" Shakespeare exhibits his present art as at least equal to that of his rivals. He accomplishes this \\"by first resorting to a country-bumpkin, fairy-tale idiot-son role, presenting himself as a Cinderella, so to speak, raised from the cinders to the skies.\\" According to Helen Vendler, > The most interesting grammatical move in the poem is the use in Q2 of > aspectual description: not \\"thou hast\\" as we would expect ‚Äî to parallel the > later \\"thou dost\\" and \\"thou art\\" ‚Äî but thine eyes...have. The eyes govern > the only four-line syntactic span (the rest of the poem is written in two- > line units). We are made to pause for a two-line relative clause between > thine eyes and its verb, have; in between subject and predicate we find ... > the poet twice arising, once to sing, once to fly: :Thine eyes, that taught > the dumb on high to sing, :And heavy ignorance aloft to fly, :Have added... Vendler compares the speaker's praise of the young man (sonnet 78) to his praise of the mistress's eyes (sonnet 132): \\"The speaker's yearning aspectual praise of the young man's eyes is comparable to his praise of the mistress' eyes in 132 (Thine eyes i love) the difference between direct second-person pronominal address to the beloved and third-person aspectual description of one of the beloved's attributes is exploited here and in 132.\\" Towards the end of the second quatrain, Vendler begins to question some of the metaphors and figurative language that Shakespeare has used: \\"Does the learned's wing need added feathers? Coming after the first soaring of the speak, the heavy added feathers and given grace seem phonetically leaden, while later the line arts with thy sweet graces graced by suggest that the learned verse has become surfeited with elaboration.\\" Another author, R.J.C. Wait, has a contrasting view of the learned wings. \\"The learneds wings represents another poet to whom Southampton has given inspiration.\\"Wait, J. C. The Background to Shakespeare's Sonnets. New York: Schocken, 1972. 78-80. Print. The last two lines of the sonnet, the couplet, begins \\"but thou art my art.\\" According to Vendler, \\"the phonetically and grammatically tautological pun ‚Äî 'Thou art all my art ' ‚Äî which conflates the copula and its predicate noun, enacts that plain mutual render, only me for thee (125) aspired to by the Sonnets and enacts as well the poet's simplicity contrasted with the affectations of the learned.\\" Rival Poet \\"Shakespeare's sonnets 78-86 concern the Speaker's rivalry with other poets and especially with one 'better spirit' who is 'learned' and 'polished'\\".Jackson, Mac.D P. \\"Francis Meres and the Cultural Contexts of Shakespeare's Rival Poet Sonnets.\\" Review of English Studies 56.224 (APR 2005): 224-46. Print. In Sonnet 78 we find out about a rival who is male and a poet and whose entry initiates an episode of jealousy that comes to a close in only Sonnet 86 These sonnets are considered to be the Rival Poet sonnets. The rival poet sonnets include three primary figures; the fair youth, the rival poet, and the lady who is desired by both men. It is not known for certain whether he rival poet of sonnets 78 to 86 is fictional or is based on an actual person. Some suggest he may be George Chapman, Christopher Marlowe, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Barnabe Barnes, Gervase Markham, or Richard Barnfield.Halliday, F. E. A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964.

According to Polish historians Czes≈Çaw Grzelak and Henryk Sta≈Ñczyk, it consisted of two mountain brigades, Lw√≥w Brigade of National Defence and a Battalion Wƒôgry (Hungary). Altogether, Karpaty Army was made of 26 battalions, 160 cannons and 16 planes. Tasks Forces as of 31 August and German plan of attack. Forces as of 14 September with troop movements up to this date. Forces after 14 September with troop movements after this date The main task of the army was to secure mountain passes in the Carpathians from Czorsztyn to Polish-Romanian border (total length 350 kilometers), and to protect the Centralny Okrƒôg Przemys≈Çowy industrial region. Furthermore, it was tasked with protection of southern wing of Krak√≥w Army, and the oil-rich area of Borys≈Çaw and Drohobycz. In late August 1939, concentration of Karpaty Army was not yet completed, as it was to be fully operational only after the complete of mobilization of the Polish Army. Karpaty Army was the weakest of all Polish armies in 1939, lacking heavy equipment, and manned by older officers. Since first hours of the war, Karpaty Army faced well-prepared Gebirgsj√§ger German divisions, whose superiority was obvious. Operational history Initially the army consisted of two improvised mountain brigades and a number of smaller units, but later in the course of war (on September 6) it was joined by forces of the withdrawing Armia Krak√≥w, and renamed Armia Ma≈Çopolska. From 11 September 1939, it was commanded by General Kazimierz Sosnkowski (after General Fabrycy was reassigned to command the Polish Southern Front). On September 1 in the morning, Karpaty Army was attacked in the area of Czorsztyn by the 4th Light Division of the Wehrmacht, supported by the 2nd Mountain Division. Backed by the Slovakian units (see Slovak invasion of Poland), the German divisions managed to break through Polish positions near Tymbark and Limanowa, causing a gap between Karpaty Army and the retreating Krak√≥w Army. As a result, Polish headquarters agreed for a withdrawal. In the first days of the invasion, Karpaty Army lacked reserve units, as its main forces, the 24th and 11th Infantry Divisions, were either still mobilized, or were on their way towards the area of Tarn√≥w. The Army took heavy casualties retreating through the San river and was destroyed during the Battle of Lw√≥w on September 20. Organization Karpaty Army was commanded by General Kazimierz Fabrycy.

History In October 1836, Jamrud was lost by the Afghan Durrani Empire and conquered by the Sikh Empire. Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa (1791-1837), the well-known Sikh general, proposed to build a big fort at Jamrud. The proposal was opposed; nevertheless the foundation of the fort that has survived was laid by General Hari Singh Nalwa on 6 Poh 1893 Sambat (18 December 1836) and the construction was completed in 54 days. \\"Jamrud...noted for its fort built with 10 feet (3 m) thick walls c.1836 by the Sikh Hari Singh Nalwa, one of Ranjit Singh's generals, was originally named Fatehgarh to commemorate the Sikh victory over the disunited tribes.\\" Early in 1837, the Sandhawalia Jat ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh's (1790-1839) grandson, Prince Nau Nihal Singh, was to be married. Hari Singh Nalwa sent his forces to Lahore for this historic celebration. At this time, Mr Fast, an Englishman, previously in the service of the British India Government, passed through Jamrud on his way to Kabul. En route he encountered Mohammad Akbar Khan, son of Dost Mohammad Khan. When Akbar Khan learnt that the fort at Jamrud was unprotected, he decided to attack. The battle between the Afghans and the Sikhs was fought on 30 April 1837. The loss suffered in this battle by the Sikhs was indeed heavy. Hari Singh Nalwa had sent out an appeal for help to the Maharaja to dispatch reinforcements from Lahore post haste, however his letter was not forwarded to the Maharaja by the Dogra chiefs. Reinforcements could not reach in time and Nalwa laid down his life in the battlefield.

He was tried by the \\"People's Court\\" and executed at Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison. Life M√ºller was born in Salm√ºnster, Hesse, the youngest of seven children of the local cantor and teacher Damien M√ºller and his wife Augusta. After obtaining his Abitur degree, he served as a volunteer in World War I, interrupted by a serious injury. After the war he resolved to become a preacher; two of his brothers also were ordained Catholic priests. He went on to study theology at the University of M√ºnster and proceeded with his brother Oskar to the Diocese of Hildesheim. Both attended the Hildesheim seminary from 1921 and received the holy orders from Bishop Joseph Ernst in the following year. Joseph M√ºller began his ecclesiastical career as a chaplain in Duderstadt. In 1924 he joined the Franciscan convent at Fulda, but later continued to work as chaplain in Gehrden, Hannoversch M√ºnden, Celle, and Wolfenb√ºttel. In 1931 he was installed as a priest in Bad Lauterberg. From 1934 he served as a priest in S√ºpplingen, from October 1937 in Heiningen. Due to his deteriorated health, he served in the small Catholic parish of Gro√ü D√ºngen from 1 August 1943 onwards. Though of frail physical condition, M√ºller was known as an inspiring orator, speaking frankly to his congregation. He was devoted to spiritual guidance, especially of young workers according to the teachings of Adolph Kolping. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, his youth work had to cope with increasing repressions by the government authorities and his activities were monitored by the Gestapo. According to the 2007 documentary Laughing with Hitler, M√ºller was arrested after repeating a political joke about a wounded soldier on his deathbed, who asked to see the people for whom he was laying down his life. The nurse laid a portrait of Hitler on his one side, and a portrait of G√∂ring on the other. Then, he gasped: \\"Now I can die like Jesus Christ.\\" M√ºller was interrogated and temporarily taken into custody on 6 September 1943 under charges of comparing Hitler and G√∂ring with the two criminals crucified alongside Jesus Christ. Although M√ºller was temporarily released, local Nazi officials re- arrested him on 15 May 1944 and he was deported to the Moabit remand prison in Berlin. Though he was interrogated by any methods at disposal, he did not reveal who told him the joke. He was brought to the \\"People's Court\\" and sentenced to death for Wehrkraftzersetzung by judge Roland Freisler in a show trial on 28 July 1944. Joseph M√ºller was executed by guillotine in Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison on September 11. After his death, Freisler would send M√ºller's family a bill for his execution.https://www.warhistoryonline.com/world-war-ii/roland-freisler- hitlers-screaming-nazi-judge.html Legacy Since the end of World War II, each year on the anniversary of M√ºller's death, a bell is tolled at his former parish church in the village of Gro√ü D√ºngen. His ashes were transferred to the local cemetery in November 1945. On May 2016, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hildesheim opened his cause of martyrdom, earning him the title Servant of God.

History  Watson grew up on a farm near Somerset East, in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. His father was a lay preacher who taught his sons Daniel, Valence, Ronald, and Gavin that all people are equal. Watson attended Graeme College boarding school in Grahamstown, where he began playing rugby union. He later captained the Graeme College side. After completing compulsory National Service, Watson returned to Port Elizabeth, where he played for the Crusaders Rugby Club. As a 21-year-old, Watson played for the Eastern Province team which lost by 28 points to 13 to the visiting All Blacks in 1976. Mona Badela, black journalist and president of the KwaZakhele Rugby Union (Kwaru), invited him to practise his Christian convictions by coaching a black side in the townships. When Watson took the black rugby team to practise at the Saint George's sports ground in Port Elizabeth, they met with strong opposition. Watson was selected as a wing for the Junior Springboks in 1976. However he declined an invitation to participate in the trails for the 1976 senior Springbok team. He joined the Spring Rose Rugby Football Club in the black township of New Brighton, Port Elizabeth, which was affiliated with Kwaru. His wing partner was Zola Yeye, later manager of the 2007 Springbok squad On 10 October 1976, Watson and Valence played with 13 black players for Kwaru against the South Eastern Districts Rugby Union (Sedru) in the Dan Qeqe stadium in KwaZakhele township. Local authorities and the Crusaders Rugby Club tried to dissuade him from participating Inter-racial sports meetings were at that time prohibited in terms of the apartheid-era Group Areas Act and the Separate Amenities Act. Armored vehicles circled the stadium, and Watson and brother Valence had to lie flat on the floor of a taxi that transported black Africans. The black rugby team regularly stayed in the Watson's home. By 1978 the Watson family had been drawn into the anti-apartheid struggle, with dual membership in the then-banned African National Congress and South African Communist Party. Brother Ronnie reportedly gathered intelligence for such organisations The Watsons were subsequently threatened, ostracised, and shot at. Their home was burned down in 1986,. Friends stopped visiting, either because they were being threatened by authorities, or because they disagreed with the Watsons' political stance. Eastern Province Rugby Union Watson is a business consultant and was the president of the Eastern Province Rugby Union based in Port Elizabeth, which operates the Eastern Province Elephants Currie Cup team and is also the co-owner of the Southern Kings team which was launched in June 2009 and will play Super Rugby from 2013 onwards. In February 2017 Watson stepped down from his role as president of the EPRU. The EPRU‚Äôs affairs had been placed into the administrative control of SA Rugby - at the union‚Äôs invitation - in April 2016 to help regularise the union‚Äôs financial affairs. Under Watson as president, the EPRU plunged into a financial crisis in 2015, with the union unable to pay players‚Äô salaries; players were forced to accept food vouchers following the non-payment of salaries. SA Rugby was eventually forced to step in and take control of the union which was eventually liquidated. Arrest on charges of fraud On 31 March 2017 Watson and three others were arrested for fraud and appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court where they were released on bail. Their arrests come after an investigation by the Hawks into money laundering and corruption related to the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Public Transport System.  Involvement in the career of his son, Luke Watson  Daniel Watson's son Luke Watson is also a rugby union footballer. Although he had many supporters in 2006, he was overlooked for selection by the 2007 World Cup winning Bok coach Jake White. Watson attributed his son's non-selection to be due to his political activities a generation earlier. Luke Watson was imposed on the 2007 Springbok squad as a result of a direct order from SARU against the wishes of the Springbok selectors. In 2007 Watson stated he would not be supporting the Springboks at the World Cup in Paris because he did not believe the team was representative of the country. He also refused to comment on whether he supported John Smit as the captain. Watson has since told South African newspapers that son Luke never wanted to play for the Springboks under White. Watson Snr also boycotted his son's capping ceremony, in protest against Coach White‚Äôs attitude towards his son. On Monday 23 April 2012 the South African Presidency announced that Daniel Watson would be awarded the National Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for \\"his exceptional contribution to the field of sport, in particular rugby‚Äù. The South African government said Watson would be recognised for his excellent contribution towards the creation of non-racial rugby and his stand in the struggle for the creation of a non- racial, non- sexist and democratic society.

She has been portrayed by Orlagh Cassidy from February 23, 1999 to September 18, 2009. Doris is perceived as a no-nonsense politician who will do just about anything to get ahead in life, often referred to as a \\"woman people love to hate.\\" Character information Doris Wolfe pulled herself up from relative poverty with little more than her own burning ambition. Raising her daughter, Ashlee, alone in a trailer park, she fought her way up the ladder to become one of Springfield's most successful lawyers. When she landed work in the District Attorney's office, she first came to prominence for her harsh and unrelenting prosecution style. She threatened Vanessa while she aided Dinah after Hart's shooting and went after Annie Dutton with a strong case that was defused when prime witness Reva Shayne refused to cooperate at the last minute. She later went after Reva herself for disconnecting Richard Winslow's life support and got her sentenced to two years (it was later dropped). Her years of work fell by the wayside however when the mayor appointed the virtually unknown Jeffrey O'Neill to the office of district attorney. Unforgiving, Doris began a vendetta against Reva and her family. She went after Jonathan and Tammy for arson, but relented on putting Tammy away when Jeffrey offered her his job to let her off. The case against Jonathan fell apart when Sandy Foster confessed to setting the fire. Undeterred, she took the next opportunity, and Ashlee's drunken adventures with Jonathan, to go after him again. Jonathan continued to taunt her by spending time with Ashlee, but Alan dissuaded her from pursuing this. He began flirting with her and used her to try to get Lizzie's baby away from her even before it was born. Finding what she had long wanted in Alan, she used the evidence she had of his involvement in Tammy's death as a brokering tool to get him to marry her. Although Beth tried to fight to keep her husband, Doris threatened both Alan and Lizzie and Beth was forced out. Soon, Doris and Alan were wed in January 2007 but he was mysteriously shot in the elevator during the ceremony. With her new husband in a coma, Doris sought to evict his former wife and her family from the mansion while moving in with Ashlee but the marriage was eventually annulled. Doris became heavily featured in the notable Otalia storyline after Emma Spaulding presented a school project, \\"My Two Mommies.\\" Doris blasted Emma's mother Olivia Spencer and her friend Natalia Rivera Aitoro about how bad of an influence they were on Emma and the community. After Olivia was struggling with her newfound romantic feelings for Natalia, on March 11, 2009, Doris ran into her at ladies night at a local bar. Doris revealed that she is a lesbian but that no one knows because no one would have elected a gay mayor. She also reveals that Ashlee doesn't know. In September 2009, Doris was forced to tell Ashlee about her sexuality. Ashlee was upset that her mother kept this lifelong secret.

Thus, the algorithm is output-sensitive: its running time depends on both the input size and the output size. Another output-sensitive algorithm, the gift wrapping algorithm, was known much earlier, but the Kirkpatrick‚ÄìSeidel algorithm has an asymptotic running time that is significantly smaller and that always improves on the \\\\mathcal{O}(n \\\\log n) bounds of non-output- sensitive algorithms. The Kirkpatrick‚ÄìSeidel algorithm is named after its inventors, David G. Kirkpatrick and Raimund Seidel. Although the algorithm is asymptotically optimal, it is not very practical for moderate-sized problems. Algorithm The basic idea of the algorithm is a kind of reversal of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for convex hulls of Preparata and Hong, dubbed \\"marriage-before-conquest\\" by the authors. The traditional divide-and-conquer algorithm splits the input points into two equal parts, e.g., by a vertical line, recursively finds convex hulls for the left and right subsets of the input, and then merges the two hulls into one by finding the \\"bridge edges\\", bitangents that connect the two hulls from above and below. The Kirkpatrick‚ÄìSeidel algorithm splits the input as before, by finding the median of the x-coordinates of the input points. However, the algorithm reverses the order of the subsequent steps: its next step is to find the edges of the convex hull that intersect the vertical line defined by this median x-coordinate, which turns out to require linear time Original paper by Kirkpatrick / Seidel (1986), p. 10, theorem 3.1. The points on the left and right sides of the splitting line that cannot contribute to the eventual hull are discarded, and the algorithm proceeds recursively on the remaining points. In more detail, the algorithm performs a separate recursion for the upper and lower parts of the convex hull; in the recursion for the upper hull, the noncontributing points to be discarded are those below the bridge edge vertically, while in the recursion for the lower hull the points above the bridge edge vertically are discarded. At the ith level of the recursion, the algorithm solves at most 2^i subproblems, each of size at most \\\\frac{n}{2^i}. The total number of subproblems considered is at most h, since each subproblem finds a new convex hull edge. The worst case occurs when no points can be discarded and the subproblems are as large as possible; that is, when there are exactly 2^i subproblems in each level of recursion up to level \\\\log_2 h . For this worst case, there are \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log h) levels of recursion and \\\\mathcal{O}(n) points considered within each level, so the total running time is \\\\mathcal{O}(n \\\\log h) as stated.

It was considered a part of the American Cosa Nostra, also known as the Mafia. History The Rochester family's first well known official boss was Constenze \\"Stanley\\" Valenti. In 1957, after the Apalachin Conference, Stan and his brother Frank were both jailed for civil contempt, because they refused to answer questions about the meeting. In 1958, Stan was sentenced to 16 months in prison, and Jake Russo became the next boss.Mario Machi, Allan May, Charlie Molino Rochester, New York Rick Porrello's AmericanMafia.com Splitting from Buffalo In 1964, Frank Valenti returned to Rochester with his brother Stan, and Pittsburgh associate Angelo Vaccaro. Frank became an associate in the Pittsburgh crime family in John LaRocca's family. Stan Valenti was married to Antonio Ripepi's daughter, who was a capo in the Pittsburgh family. This time, Frank Valenti was taking over the Rochester family. By the end of the year, Russo went missing and his body has never been found. In 1970, Valenti wiped out the last Russo soldier Billy Lupo. Also Frank Valenti told Buffalo crime family boss Stefano \\"The Undertaker\\" Magaddino that Rochester would become an independent family. Prior to this, Rochester was just a crew which answered to the Maggadino's Buffalo crime family. The Valenti regime Valenti created a well-organized crime family by promoting Samuel Russotti to underboss, Rene Picarreto to consigliere and Salvatore Gingello, Dominic Celestino, Thomas Didio, Angelo Vaccaro and Dominic Chirico as his capos. His most trusted ally was capo Chirio, who he gave special tasks to carry out. He divided up the family's illegal activities of gambling, extortion, loan sharking, insurance fraud, arson, narcotics and weapon trafficking among his capos to ensure peace. Valenti created a master plan in 1970 called \\"The Columbus Day Bombings\\". He set up a special crew to bomb various churches and public buildings to draw the heat away from the family. In 1972, Valenti was approached by his underboss Samuel \\"Red\\" Russotti, his consigliere Rene Piccarreto, and highly powerful capo Salvatore \\"Sammy G\\" Gingello. The three accused Valenti of skimming profits and asked him to step down as boss; he refused. Valenti felt that the Pittsburgh family would back him and the Chirico crew up with muscle. Unknown to him was that his consigliere, Picarreto, had made a secret alliance with members of the Bonanno crime family. Valenti's most trusted capo and bodyguard, Domenic Chirico, was shot and killed on Augustine Street. Instead of fighting he was allowed to move to Phoenix, Arizona and retire. After retiring Valenti was arrested and convicted of extortion, he later died on September 20, 2008. The Russotti era After Valenti fled the city, Samuel Russotti became boss, Piccarreto remained as consigliere, and Gingello became the underboss. The family was strong until January 1977 when the police fabricated evidence to indict all the upper echelon. The convictions put Russotti, Piccaretto, Gingello, Thomas Marotta and Eugene DeFrancesco away for murdering Vincent Massaro with a 25 years to life sentenced. When this happened, Thomas Didio became the acting boss. Russotti thought he would be able to manipulate Didio, but he really just created a monster. Didio began demoting all the Russotti loyalist while receiving advice from imprisoned former boss Valenti. When the truth came out about the fabricated evidence, all the top guys got out of prison. This created an \\"A team and B Team\\" war. Part of the \\"A team\\" was Russotti, Piccarreto, Gingello, Richard Marino, Thomas Marotta and others. Part of the \\"B Team\\" was Thomas Didio, Rosario Chirico (Domenic's brother), Stan Valenti, Angelo Vaccaro and others. On April 23, 1978, Salvatore \\"Sammy G\\" Gingello was killed when a bomb was detonated when he entered his car, which was parked across from the Stillson St. restaurant, Ben's Cafe Society. On July 6, 1978 Thomas Didio was murdered by a gunman who was using a machine gun. After these two murders the FBI decided it was time to crack down on the situation, with RICO coming into play they took down most of the remaining key players. In 1988, Angelo Amico and Loren Piccarreto were both indicted under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Angelo Amico was the acting boss, and Loren Piccarreto (son of Rene Piccarreto) was the underboss.

Oliveri participated in the July 1978 murder of Thomas Didio, who was murdered by Anthony Columbo with a machine gun, inside of a motel in Victor, New York. He was allegedly inducted into the Rochester mob in December 1978. He became an informer since at least in 1980. He testified in December 1984 against several members of the Rochester crime family.

The film stars Stefania Rocca and Liam Cunningham and is Argento's second giallo feature of the decade (following Sleepless). The film features a brief role by Fiore Argento, the director's eldest daughter. She had previously appeared in her father's films Phenomena and Demons.  Plot  The film centers around a serial killer known as \\"The Card Player\\", who is kidnapping young women in Rome. Using a webcam set-up, the killer challenges the police by forcing them to play hands of Internet poker. If the police lose, the kidnapped victim is tortured and murdered on-screen. When a British tourist is among the girls murdered, policeman John Brennan (Cunningham) is assigned the case and quickly teams up with Italian detective Anna Mari (Rocca). The duo have their work cut out for them when the Police Chief's daughter (Argento) becomes the killer's latest kidnapping victim.

Chief * Verra Gemma as Third Victim  Production  Originally conceived as a sequel to the director's own The Stendhal Syndrome to be titled In the Dark, the film was rewritten when that film's star, Asia Argento, declined to be involved. The setting was changed from Venice to Rome to bring costs down and recapture the feel of Argento's early giallo, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. The director said: \\"My fans love it when I shoot in Rome. The city is the most wonderful film set ever, like a dusty museum with its cocktail of rundown buildings and beautiful open spaces.\\"  Release  The film was released in Italy in January 2004. In the United States, following a small number of cinema screenings, it was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment later that year. The film premiered on DVD in the UK in October 2004, after receiving a 15 certificate from the BBFC.  Critical reception  The Card Player received a negative response from critics. The film has an approval rating of 20% on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on ten reviews. The New York Times wrote, \\"The Card Player [...] doesn't break the unhappy streak of his [Argento's] later films. Though it's based on a promisingly outrageous premise [...] the film unfolds as a tired, thoroughly conventional police procedural that might as well be titled CSI: Roma.\\" AllMovie's review was unfavorable, writing, \\"The Card Player offers a fair amount of suspense and at least one memorable set piece, but for those even remotely familiar with Argento's canon, there's the feeling that it's all been done before ‚Äì and handled with much more style and confidence.\\" Maitland McDonagh also gave the film a negative review, criticizing the screenplay for being \\"perfunctory\\" and for going \\"to so little trouble to hide the killer's identity that even inattentive viewers will know who's to blame long before the police figure it out.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2004 films Category:Italian-language films Category:English- language films Category:Italian films Category:2004 horror films Category:Giallo films Category:Films scored by Claudio Simonetti Category:Police detective films Category:Films directed by Dario Argento Category:Italian serial killer films Category:2000s mystery films Category:2000s crime thriller films Category:Films with screenplays by Dario Argento Category:Snuff films in fiction Category:Gambling films ","title":"The Card Player"},{"id":"11699168","text":"Vielitzsee is a municipality in the Ostprignitz-Ruppin district, in Brandenburg, Germany.

Biography James Tully was one of the four general editors of the Cambridge University Press Ideas in Context Series. He first gained his reputation for his scholarship on the political philosophy of John Locke, and has written on constitutionalism, diversity, indigenous politics, recognition theory, multiculturalism, and imperialism. He was special advisor to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1991‚Äì1995). Over his career, Tully has held positions at Cambridge University, Oxford University, McGill University, University of Toronto, and the University of Victoria. University of Victoria After completing his PhD at Cambridge University and his undergraduate degree at the University of British Columbia, he taught in the departments of Philosophy and Political Science at McGill University 1977‚Äì1996. He was Professor and Chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria 1996‚Äì2001. In 2001‚Äì2003 he was the inaugural Henry N.R. Jackman Distinguished Professor in Philosophical Studies at the University of Toronto in the departments of Philosophy and Political Science, and in the Faculty of Law. Tully claims to have enjoyed his time at the University of Toronto, but preferred the open atmosphere and climate in British Columbia. He eventually returned to the University of Victoria in 2003, where he is now the Distinguished Professor of Political Science, Law, Indigenous Governance and Philosophy. Tully was influential in shaping the University of Victoria's Political Science department, which is renowned for its strong political theory program. Political philosophy Renewing and transforming public philosophy Tully's approach to the study and teaching of politics is a form of historical and critical reflection on problems of political practice in the present. It is an attempt to renew and transform the tradition of public philosophy so it can effectively address the pressing political problems of our age in a genuinely democratic way. It does this by means of a dual dialogue of reciprocal and mutual learning among equals: between academics in different disciplines addressing the same problems (multidisciplinary); and between academics and citizens addressing the problems and struggles on the ground by their own ways of knowing and doing (democratic). The aim is to throw critical light on contemporary political problems by means of studies that free us to some extent from hegemonic ways of thinking and acting politically, enabling us to test their limits and to see and consider the concrete possibilities of thinking and acting differently.James Tully, \\"Public Philosophy and civic freedom: a guide to the two volumes,\\" Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom, and Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom (Cambridge University Press, 2008), pp. 1‚Äì11 (both volumes). For more detail, see Public Philosophy I: Part I: Approaching Practice, pp. 13‚Äì132. The politics of cultural recognition Spirit of Haida Gwaii by Bill ReidTully's 1995, Strange Multiplicity: Constitutionalism in an Age of Diversity engages with the famous indigenous sculpture Spirit of Haida Gwaii by Bill Reid as a metaphor for the kind of democratic constitutionalism that can help reconcile the competing claims of multicultural and multinational societies.\\"The spirit of Haida Gwaii, I would now like you to imagine, can be seen as just such a constitutional dialogue, or multilogue, of mutual recognition,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity: Constitutionalism in an Age of Diversity (Cambridge University Press, 2004 [1995]), p. 24. The 'strange multiplicity' of cultural diversity is embodied in the varied and assorted canoe passengers \\"squabbling and vying for recognition and position.\\"\\"The passengers are squabbling and vying for recognition and position each in their culturally distinct way. They are exchanging their diverse stories and claims as the chief appears to listen attentively to each, hoping to guide them to reach an agreement, without imposing a metalanguage or allowing any speaker to set the terms of the discussion. The chief‚Äôs subjection to the rule of mutual recognition is symbolised by the crests of the crew's nations and families carved in the speaker's staff,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 24. There is no universal constitutional order imposed from above nor a single category of citizenship, because identities and relations change over time.\\"Since recognition is never definitive, the particular constitutional arrangement of the members of the canoe is presumably not meant to be fixed once and for all. Constitutional recognition and association change over time, as the canoe progresses and the members change in various ways. A constitution is more like an endless series of contracts and agreements, reached by periodical intercultural dialogues, rather than an original contract in the distant past, an ideal speech- situation today, or a mythic unity of the community in liberal and nationalist constitutionalism,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 26. This view rejects the \\"mythic unity of the community\\" imagined \\"in liberal and nationalist constitutionalism.\\"Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 26. The critique of modern, presumptively 'universal' conceptions of citizenship are developed in Tully, Public Philosophy I & II. Tully argues that the concept of 'culture' is more flexible and constructive for thinking about the rival claims of political groups than the more rigid and exclusive concept 'nation.'\\"The consequence of national and liberal constitutions, which have been the dominant forms over the last three hundred years, is precisely the contemporary resistance and demands for recognition of the members whose cultures have been excluded, assimilated or exterminated. A just form of constitution must begin with the full mutual recognition of the different cultures of its citizens,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity, pp. 7‚Äì8. Culture more readily suggests that group identities are plural, overlapping, and changing over time in their encounters with others. Unlike nationalism, the politics of cultural recognition does not assume that every group aspires to its own culturally homogenous 'nation- state.'\\"Although this has been the dominant form of constitutional recognition since the seventeenth century, it cannot be simply extended to the demands for cultural recognition today,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 8. Rather, cultures must find ways to share spaces and co-exist. While they may always strive to determine their own identities and relations, pursuant to \\"self rule, the oldest political good in the world,\\"Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 5. the solution is not to crack down on diversity or to impose one cultural model over others. The solution is to broaden opportunities for participation and contestation, to further democratize institutions and relations of governance, including foundational constitutions. According to Tully, \\"a constitution should not be seen as a fixed set of rules but, rather, as an imperfect form of accommodation of the diverse members of a political association that is always open to negotiation by the members of the association.\\"‚ÄúResearch,‚Äù James Tully webpage on University of Victoria website, accessed 18 November 2014; see also: \\"a constitution can be both the foundation of democracy and, at the same time, subject to democratic discussion and change in practice,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 29.A major theme of Tully‚Äôs work is a careful reconceptualization or clarification of a series of contested terms, including the notions of constitution, freedom, citizenship, and the adjectives democratic, civic, and global. Tully \\"re- describes\\" each to emphasize not static categories or abstract, transcendental or universal qualities, but rather practice or praxis ‚Äì dialogical relations, action, and contestation. For more on Tully‚Äôs methodological approach, drawing heavily on the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Cambridge School of thought, and Michel Foucault, see Tully, Public Philosophy I, pp. 4‚Äì5, 10, 15‚Äì131, Public Philosophy II, pp. 254‚Äì256; see also David Owen, \\"Series Editor‚Äôs Foreword,\\" in James Tully, On Global Citizenship: James Tully in Dialogue (London: Bloomsbury, 2014), pp. ix‚Äìx, Robert Nichols and Jakeet Singh, \\"Editors' Introduction,\\" Freedom and Democracy in an Imperial Context: Dialogues with James Tully (London: Routledge, 2014), pp. 1‚Äì3. No aspect of relations should be off limits to deliberation if called into question by participants affected by those relations. This is what Tully means by \\"democratic constitutionalism\\" as opposed to more conventional \\"constitutional democracy.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy I, p. 4. From this perspective, Tully can claim that \\"[t]he constitution is thus one area of modern politics that has not been democratised over the last three hundred years.\\"Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 28. For Tully, The Spirit of Haida Gwaii prefigures a more democratic, pluralistic, and just society. It evokes a simpler, more elegant, and sustainable ethos of gift-reciprocity in all our relationships, human and non-human. Getting along may be messy and imperfect business, but the passengers continue to row cooperatively, and the canoe of society glides onward.\\"For all the celebration of diversity and the vying for recognition, the paddles are somehow in unison and they appear to be heading in some direction [...] This seems to imply that the kind of constitutional change required to meet the just demands for recognition can be carried out without capsizing a society,\\" Tully, Strange Multiplicity, p. 28. Practices of civic freedom and global citizenship In Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom, and Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom (2008), Tully expands his approach \\"to a broader range of contemporary struggles: over diverse forms of recognition, social justice, the environment and imperialism.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy I, p. 4. Tully‚Äôs work on Public Philosophy I & II \\"leads him to elaborate the implications of his revised view of freedom for multinational democracy and extend his analysis to encompass the history of Western imperialism,\\" Owen, \\"Series Editor‚Äôs Foreword,\\" in On Global Citizenship, pp. xi‚Äìxii. Also, \\"Tully‚Äôs aim, then, is to develop alternative notions of freedom and democracy that can be woven into a non- imperial, or in fact de-imperializing, way of life,\\" Nichols and Singh, \\"Editors' Introduction,\\" Freedom and Democracy, p. 2. The two volumes mark a shift toward a principal emphasis on freedom. \\"The primary question,\\" Tully writes, \\"is thus not recognition, identity or difference, but freedom; the freedom of the members of an open society to change the constitutional rules of mutual recognition and association from time to time as their identities change.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy I, p. 189. And \\"Freedom versus domination is thus the emerging focus of politics in multinational societies at the dawn of the new millennium,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy I, p. 190. This is \\"civic freedom,\\" referring to the capacity people have to participate in the constitution of their own governance relations.\\"This is the fundamental democratic or civic freedom of citizens ‚Äì having an effective say in a dialogue over the norms through which they are governed,\\" Public Philosophy I, p. 310. And \\"To be free democratically is not only to be able to participate in various ways in accordance with the principles, rules and procedures of the constitutional system, as important as this is, but also, and crucially, always to be able to take one step back, dissent and call into question the principles, rules or procedures by which one is governed and to enter into (rule-governed) deliberations over them,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 93‚Äì94. To the extent that governance relations restrict this basic freedom, \\"they constitute a structure of domination, the members are not self- determining, and the society is unfree.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy I, p. 190 Conditions of oppression, however, do not rule out or discount practices of civic freedom. Tully's public philosophy is not concerned with ideal conditions or hoped-for peaceful futures. Rather, civic freedom exists in conduct and in relations in the \\"here and now,\\"Tully, Public Philosophy I, pp. 20, 154, 288, Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 73, 90, 120‚Äì121, 189, 190, 229. not least under conditions of oppression and conflict. Against violence and tyranny, Tully argues, practices of civic freedom make the best \\"strategies of confrontation,\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 280‚Äì309. because they generate conditions for transformative change. The concluding chapter of Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II examines \\"the democratic means to challenge and transform imperial relationships [and] brings together the three themes of the two volumes: public philosophy, practices of civic freedom and the countless ways they work together to negotiate and transform oppressive relationships.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy I, p. 8; see especially Public Philosophy II, pp. 296‚Äì309, and Tully, On Global Citizenship, pp. 88‚Äì97, 305‚Äì308. Tully's civics-based approach offers a new way of thinking about a diverse array of contemporary and historical traditions of democratic struggle,Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 51‚Äì53; \\"Middle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism: A view of the field from the demos,\\" Middle East Law and Governance, 4 (2012), 225‚Äì263. including environmental movementsTully, \\"An Ecological Ethics for the Present,\\" in Public Philosophy II, pp. 73‚Äì88; also pp. 70‚Äì72. and indigenous struggle.Tully, \\"The Struggle of Indigenous Peoples for and of Freedom,\\" in Public Philosophy I, pp. 257‚Äì288 Tully summarizes the approach and its potential: > 'Practices of civic freedom' comprise the vast repertoire of ways of > citizens acting together on the field of governance relationships and > against the oppressive and unjust dimensions of them. These range from ways > of 'acting otherwise' within the space of governance relationships to > contesting, negotiating, confronting and seeking to transform them. The > general aim of these diverse civic activities is to bring oppressive and > unjust governance relationships under the on-going shared authority of the > citizenry subject to them; namely, to civicise and democratize them from > below. From this perspective, these kinds of powerful, civic movements are not deviations or anomalies to be corrected or appeased through discipline or cooptation, but exemplars of civic freedom.\\"They are classified [by the dominant discourses and institutions] as acts of civil disobedience or rebellion. If these illegal struggles are successful and the extensions institutionalised, then the extensions are redescribed retrospectively as stages in the development of modern citizenship and incorporated within its framework, as in the cases of working-class struggles giving rise to social and economic rights, women gaining recognition as citizens, civil rights movements and recognition of cultural minorities. Thus, what are seen as activities of citizenship by the civic tradition ‚Äì struggles for new forms of recognition and extensions of citizenship ‚Äì fall outside of modern [conventional] citizenship with its institutional/status orientation,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 256, also, pp. 298, 308‚Äì309.

However, this is no utopian vision, according to Tully, referring to the \\"thousands\\" and \\"millions of examples of civic\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 306, 308. practices everyday that make another world not only possible but \\"actual.\\"\\"Another world is actual,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 301. To clarify and reinforce this approach, Tully argues for an expanded conception of the term citizenship to encompass all forms of governance-related conduct, with an emphasis on \\"negotiated practices.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 248. Civic or global citizenship refers to the myriad of relations and practices (global and local) people find themselves embedded and participating in.\\"From the civic perspective, citizenship comes into being whenever and wherever people who are subject to or affected by practices of governance become active co-agents within them; exercising the powers of having a say (negotiating) and having a hand (powers of self-organization and self- government) in and over the relationships that govern their interaction,\\" Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 272. The term global draws attention to the diverse and overlapping character of governance ‚Äì and hence citizen ‚Äì relations.Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 243‚Äì249. Modes of civic and global citizenship \\"are the means by which cooperative practices of self-government can be brought into being and the means by which unjust practices of governance can be challenged, reformed and transformed by those who suffer under them.\\"Tully, On Global Citizenship, pp. 272‚Äì273. Tully carefully distinguishes his expanded notion of citizenship (diverse, cooperative, civic, global) from the narrower but more conventional notion of citizenship, which he calls \\"civil citizenship\\" (modern, institutional, and international).Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 246‚Äì309. Where civic denotes practice and pluralism, civil citizenship singularly refers to \\"a status given by the institutions of the modern constitutional state in international law.\\" This kind of (civil) citizenship is associated with the dominant tradition of liberalism, in which the state ensures a free market, a set of negative liberties (especially protections against state infringements into the private sphere), and a narrow range of participation through institutions of free speech and representative government.Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 250‚Äì256; see also \\"Two Traditions of Human Rights,\\" in Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals, pp. 139‚Äì148. Tully argues that this dominant module of civil citizenship is neither universal nor inevitable; rather, it is \\"one singular, historical form of citizenship among others.\\" More problematically, the civil tradition often plays handmaiden to empire, insofar as imperial powers operate under international banners of 'progress' and 'liberalism': > the dominant forms of representative democracy, self-determination and > democratisation promoted through international law are not alternatives to > imperialism, but, rather, the means through which informal imperialism > operates against the wishes of the majority of the population of the post- > colonial world.Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 158. By contextualizing and de-centering, or \\"provincializing,\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 249. modern categories of \\"allegedly universal\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 247. citizenship, Tully aims to broaden and democratize the field of citizenship and citizen practices. \\"This [civic and global] mode of citizenship,\\" he argues, \\"has the capacity to overcome the imperialism of the present age and bring a democratic world into being.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 243. More recently, Tully has emphasized the importance of \\"coordinating\\" the different ways that civil (deliberative) and civic (cooperative) citizens address the same political problems, such as social and ecological justice.Tully, \\"Two ways of realizing justice and democracy: Linking Amartya Sen and Elinor Ostrom,\\" CRISPP, 16.2 (March 2013), pp. 220‚Äì233; also, Tully, On Global Citizenship, pp. 84‚Äì100, especially under \\"Joining hands and working together,\\" pp. 97‚Äì100. To illustrate, \\"The life of Gandhi provides an example of how these two modes of citizenship can complement each other. As a representative democrat he supported the Congress Party and representative government, and he reasoned and negotiated endlessly in the official public spheres available to him.[omitted footnote] Yet, he also grounded himself in cooperative citizenship practices of non-violent agonistics and regime change, and in alternative practices of social, economic and ecological self-government,\\" Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 99. The transformative power of nonviolence In the closing pages of Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II, Tully explicitly links his work to the study and practice of nonviolence. He identifies four main components of Mahatma Gandhi's life practice of Satyagraha that offer a model for approaching civic freedom and global citizenship practices: 1) noncooperation with unjust institutions, 2) a commitment to nonviolent means of resistance, 3) a focus on local, community-based modes of self-reliance and self-governance, and 4), as a precursor to these three components, \\"personal practices of self-awareness and self-formation.\\"\\"The first is active non-cooperation vis-√†-vis any imperial (non-civic) relationship and its corresponding idea of one universal civilisation or cosmopolitanism for all. The second is the way of peace. For Gandhi this consists in civic organisation and uncompromising non-violent confrontation and negotiation with those responsible for imperial relationships with the aim of converting them to non-violent, democratic and peaceful relationships. Thirdly, for these two activities to be effective they have to be grounded in the local field and practices of the alternative world you want to bring about. For Gandhi this consists of 'constructive work' in local, self-reliant, civically organised Indian villages and respectful participation in their ways [‚Ä¶] Fourthly, the first three practices are integrated into a singular style of civic life by the more personal practices of self-awareness and self-formation,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 308‚Äì309. According to Tully, these cornerstones of nonviolent power \\"are daily practices of becoming an exemplary citizen.\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 309 Tully has since focused increasingly on the study and practice nonviolent ethics and nonviolent resistance.\\"Since publishing PPNK [Public Philosophy in a New Key] I have been presenting the best arguments of the antiwar and peace movements against the politics of an economy of violence and enmity and for a politics of nonviolence and compassion,\\" Tully, Democracy and Freedom, p. 239. See especially Tully, \\"Two Traditions of Human Rights,\\" in Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals, pp. 149‚Äì156; Tully, \\"Middle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism: A view of the field from the demos,\\" Middle East Law and Governance, 4 (2012), pp. 225‚Äì240, 250‚Äì263. \\"Global Disorder and Two Responses,\\" Journal of Intellectual History and Political Thought, 2.1 (November), pp. 49‚Äì62; Tully, On Global Citizenship, pp. 88‚Äì100, 276‚Äì319, 325‚Äì327, and Tully, Freedom and Democracy, 239‚Äì247, 264‚Äì266 (there is some overlap between these sources). For example, he writes, > the alternative of a politics of reasonable nonviolent cooperation and > agonistics (Satyagraha) was discovered in the twentieth century by William > James, Gandhi, Abdul Gaffar Khan, Einstein, Ashley Montagu, Bertrand > Russell, Martin Luther King Junior, Thomas Merton, Thich Nhat Hanh, Gene > Sharp, Petra Kelly, Johan Galtung and Barbara Deming. They argued that the > antagonistic premise of western theories of reasonable violence is false. > Nonviolent practices of cooperation, disputation and dispute resolution are > more basic and prevalent than violent antagonism. This is a central feature > of civic freedom.Tully, Democracy and Freedom, p. 247. A major overlap between Tully's civic freedom and the study of nonviolence is the shared emphasis on practice, on methods, on means rather than on ends. \\"For cooperative citizens,\\" Tully writes, \\"means and ends are internally related, like a seed to the full-grown plant, as Gandhi put it.\\"Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 96. This is because means \\"are pre-figurative or constitutive of ends. Consequently, democratic and peaceful relationships among humans are brought about by democratic and non-violent means.\\"Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 96 Tully repudiates the \\"depressing history\\"\\"Democratic citizens have learned from this depressing history that distrust and violence beget distrust and violence and from the history of nonviolence that there is another more powerful way that leads to peace,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 295. of \\"self-defeating violent means.\\"Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 99. He rejects the idea, prevalent across the spectrum of Western political thought, from revolutionaries to reactionaries (the \\"reigning dogma of the left and right\\"Tully, Freedom and Democracy, p. 240) that peaceful and democratic societies can be brought about by coercive and violent means. Rather, according to Tully, \\"the means of violence and command relationships do not bring about peace and democracy. They too are constitutive means. They bring about security dilemmas and the spiral of the command relations necessary for war preparation, arms races and more violence.\\" For these reasons, Tully extends his civics-based public philosophy to \\"practitioners and social scientists [who] are beginning to appreciate the transformative power of participatory non-violence and the futility of war in comparison.\\"Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 97. On the \\"transformative power of nonviolence,\\" see especially On Global Citizenship, pp. 306‚Äì308: confronting violence with nonviolence \\"is often considered the fundamental transformative power of non-violence since it transforms the opponents and the relationship between them from one mode of being to another. Along with constructive programmes it is at the core of Gandhi‚Äôs Satyagraha. It is called the jiu-jitsu logic of non-violence because it uses the movements and dis- equilibrium of the opponent to bring about the transformation. The non-violent actors are not only offering and suggesting a non-violent alternative in which they can combine their energy and work together rather than wasting it in futile conflict, they also manifest this alternative in their interaction and envelope the violent others in these non-violent and potentially transformative relationships. They are being peace and making peace at one and the same time. Most of the more complex and mediated techniques and strategies of non-violent agonistics are derived from and extend the bodily logic of interaction and transformation of this famous phenomenological prototype. [citing Richard Gregg's 1934 The Power of Nonviolence] The other technique that is equally important is non-cooperation. As we have seen, the civic tradition claims that unjust regimes rest not on violence or manufactured consensus but on cooperation in the sense of compliance. Therefore, the basic technique of dealing with an unjust regime from √âtienne de la Bo√©tie to the Egyptian Spring and non-violent Intifada is to withdraw cooperation in the everyday reproduction of the unjust system of cooperation,\\" Tully, On Global Citizenship, pp. 306‚Äì307. Sustainability and Gaia citizenship Tully's approach to nonviolent citizenship practices includes relations with the non- human world. Tully argues that Homo Sapiens should see themselves as interdependent civic citizens of the ecological relationships in which they live and breathe and have their being. As such, they have responsibilities to care for and sustain these relationships that, in reciprocity, sustain them and all the other life forms that are interdependent on them.\\"Civic citizens are thus 'caretakers' of the goods of the dwelling places in which they live. In so doing, they dissolve the modernist distinction between culture and nature that separates civics from the places in which it is enacted. Every locale and network of locales of civic activity is not only culturally diverse but also a place in the natural world with its web of relationships of biological and ecological diversity. They see the interactive and interdependent relationships between humans and nature as similar in kind to human relationships, and they attend to and care for them in similar ways. They listen and respond carefully to nature as a living being (Gaia) in their ecological sciences and daily practices of treading lightly. Civic citizens realise that this non-metaphorical field of possibilities in human/natural relationships and its limited Spielraum is the ground of all others. They are Gaia citizens,\\" Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 293. Tully's \\"Gaia citizenship\\"Tully, Public Philosophy II, p. 293; Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 93; Tully, \\"Trust, Mistrust and Distrust in Diverse Societies,\\" in Trust and Distrust in Diverse Societies, ed. by Dimitrios Karmis, forthcoming; Tully, \\"Reconciliation Here on Earth,\\" forthcoming (video of talk). draws on earth sciences and life sciences as well as indigenous traditions. For example, pointing to the work of ecological scientists from Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and Barry Commoner to the Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change, Tully links the unsustainability crisis of the Anthropocene to his own critique of \\"modern civil\\" modes of governmentality (as violent, exploitative, and destructive).Tully, On Global Citizenship, p. 93; Tully, \\"Trust in Diverse Societies,\\" forthcoming; Tully, \\"Reconciliation Here on Earth,\\" forthcoming. Likewise, he points to Indigenous knowledge that conceptualises human interconnectedness with the earth as gift-reciprocity relationships and as a model for social relationships.\\"Just as the living earth consists of gift- reciprocity relationships that sustain the living members, so humans should relate to the living earth and each other in their social relationships in the same general way,\\" Tully, \\"Reconciliation Here on Earth,\\" forthcoming; and \\"Moreover, Indigenous peoples insist that they did not invent this system. Rather, like life and earth scientists today, they observe the gift- reciprocity relationship in the symbiotic and symbiogenetic ecological relationships of interdependency that co-sustain and co-evolve non-human forms of life, and they learn from this how human associations should relate to each other,\\" Tully, \\"Trust in Diverse Societies,\\" forthcoming. The famous Indigenous artwork Spirit of Haida Gwaii remains exemplary of democratic and pluralistic ways of thinking and acting ‚Äì between humans and the natural environments on which they depend.\\"The canoe is everywhere humans and non- humans dwell together. Wherever we are, we are symbiotically interdependent in the way the passengers are in the canoe. This is why we have responsibilities to respect each other and our diverse ways of living, because, as a matter of fact, they all support each other, like an old growth forest. But, in order to see this, we need to listen patiently to each other and see how the diversity looks from different perspectives, as they are doing,\\" Tully, \\"Reconciliation Here on Earth,\\" forthcoming. Tully's argument is that his account of interdependent agents in relationships of governance and situated freedom can be extended with modifications to describe human situatedness in ecological relationships ‚Äì as either giving rise to 'virtuous' or 'vicious cycles', depending on how we act in and on them.\\"Whether the partners generate trustful and peaceful relationships through virtuous cycles of reciprocal interaction or distrustful and aggressive relationships through vicious cycles of antagonism depends in part on whether they become aware of this interweaving of their identities in the course of their interactions or whether they hold fast to atomism: the false belief that their individual and collective identities exist prior to and independent of encounter and interaction,\\" Tully, \\"Trust in Diverse Societies,\\" forthcoming. And \\"The aim is to work together to transform unsustainable relationships into conciliatory and sustainable ones: that is, to transform a vicious social system into a virtuous social system that sustains the ways of life of all affected,\\" Tully, \\"Reconciliation Here on Earth,\\" forthcoming.

Beverlee McKinsey was the first actress to play the role, which she did from February 10, 1984, to August 21, 1992. McKinsey made the character one of the most memorable women on daytime television and although she loved her family, \\"her voice dripped venom when she addressed her enemies.\\" Lydia Bruce (Maggie Powers, \\"The Doctors\\") played the role of Alexandra for a couple of days in the fall of 1984 after the death of McKinsey's husband, Berkeley Harris. After an extensive search for a permanent replacement, Marj Dusay, who had played the ruthless matriarch/businessman Myrna Clegg on Capitol, was hired and portrayed the character from September 23, 1993, to March 11, 1997, from November 20, 1998, to January 21, 1999, and finally from December 26, 2002, until the final episode on September 18, 2009. She received an Emmy Nomination for the role in 1995. Legendary film and television actress Joan Collins, best known for her role as Alexis Colby on the primetime soap Dynasty, guest starred in the role for three months from September 23, 2002, to December 23, 2002, having originally signed for six. Collins' portrayal brought a large amount of press and attention to the show as her incarnation of the character was known as \\"your typical rich bitch.\\" Collins was even reported to have re-written her lines to accommodate the large amount of dialogue she needed to learn and grueling work schedule. Background Brief Character History After a difficult childhood, throughout which she and her brother, Alan, alternated between feuding and supporting one another against their domineering father, Brandon, the young Alexandra ran away from her family wealth to gallivant across Europe in a series of relationships with poor musicians before marrying a baron, divorcing him and finally arriving in Springfield. She soon became a close ally of Phillip Spaulding and made it her life's duty to destroy her brother Alan Spaulding's plots. This included the 'Dreaming Death' conspiracy, for which she turned him in to the FBI. He vanished soon after and she used her influence to help bring her friends and lovers into the company. Over the years, she's searched out many of the relatives she believed she lost, including a sister, Victoria, with whom she offered to share the family fortune. More important was her reunion with wayward son Lujack, who she eventually won over despite his misgivings. She supported him in his endeavors, although sadly he would die in an explosion. Her life got more complicated when her supposedly dead brother reappeared looking for revenge of his own. She fled to San Rios where she was kidnapped by rebels before being rescued and returned to Springfield. Her complicated love/hate relationship with Alan would endure for the rest of his life, with them alternately defending and confiding in one another and battling one another for control of the family company. She began a romance with H.B. Lewis before a plane crash left her on a desert island, with Fletcher Reade and a mysterious man who turned out to be Roger Thorpe. Surprisingly, she married Roger soon after returning, but the marriage was doomed and she publicly humiliated him before subjecting him to blackmail. More surprisingly, she discovered Lujack's twin, Nick McHenry, and pulled him into the family, but alienated him with her continuing meddling in his life and in his marriage to Mindy Lewis, Roger's former mistress. Over time, they came to trust one another as she tried to help him with a career. She eventually came around to accept his relationship with Mindy and encouraged him to fight for her. But Mindy was tired of the intrigue and divorced him before leaving town. When Alan returned in 1994 after being released from prison, Alexandra fought with him over control, but they eventually came to an understanding. When she discovered that Roger had manipulated her into giving Alan back his assets, she pretended to seduce him so Holly would break up with him. Her plan backfired when Holly ended up in Fletcher's arms and ended up marrying him. Alexandra attended the wedding and was amused when Roger showed up and created a scene. When Nick fell in love with Susan Bates, who was HIV positive, Alexandra was supportive of the relationship. Alexandra's days in Springfield came to a brief end in early 1997 after it was revealed that she knew the secret that Alan's supposed daughter, Amanda Wexler, was really their sister, having been fathered by Brandon. Alexandra came back for Philip and Harley's wedding in 1998 but didn't stay for long. Tired of endless corporate intrigue, she left for Europe with Nick and his wife Susan after discovering that Alan was hiding the nefarious Annie Dutton in the Spaulding attic. She would return several years later, after Alan had a heart attack and the company was in turmoil. She pushed him out and tried to keep the bottle on Gus' parentage as long as possible. When it came out, desperate to hold onto the power she had left, she drugged Alan and tried to drive him mad. He went one better and managed to trick her into a confession of her crimes, not least of which was the stalking and covert harassment of Reva Shayne. He pushed her out of company leadership and into pharmaceuticals. There, she got involved with illegal trading and the sinister Antimonius drug ring. Alan, to her surprise, tried to save her from prosecution, but when Frank Cooper would not relent, she tried to frame him. This backfired, destroying her relationship with Frank's father Buzz Cooper and she ended up in jail only to be freed by her brother just as Phillip was 'murdered'. The siblings continued their fighting, if in a somewhat more low- key fashion, while she blackmailed him for his role in Phillip's death. Her testimony eventually freed Harley Cooper and almost jailed Alan. Subsequently, she played a more minor role, mostly as a help to Alan-Michael and a much needed balance to her brother. She had one final major storyline when Alexandra suddenly married her much younger chauffeur as an effort of keeping him in the country and committed several crimes in order to keep him out of the arms of the much younger Marina Cooper. During the last year of the show, Alexandra became a sounding board of advice to her back-from-the-dead nephew, Philip, his daughter Lizzie and various friends and family members who forgave her for her past schemes. In the Guiding Light finale, Alexandra mourned the sudden death of her brother Alan and left Springfield to travel around Europe with Fletcher Reade, promising to return for an upcoming family wedding.

The current version (4.0.3) was released in 2010. In February 2011, the author told the MusEdit Yahoo group that after \\"upgrading and supporting MusEdit for nearly 15 years\\" he \\"won't be able to continue supporting MusEdit\\" and plans he \\"to make MusEdit 'Open Source' by mid-March, 2011. This means the MusEdit source code will be free and open for anyone to use and modify as they wish under a standard 'open source' license.\\" However, by August 2012, the MusEdit website was no longer available, and its domain registration is running out by 24 November 2012. Later news and downloads are available on the MusEdit Yahoo groups site.  Features  MusEdit allows the user to produce professional-quality music scores for all kinds of solo instruments, ensembles and orchestras. The music files can be played back, printed, exported as graphics and used to generate MIDI files and text tab. Musedit can also import MIDI files and text tab. For example, Musedit can be used to create and play back: * Music scores with up to 20 parts. * Music and Tablature for Guitar, Bass, and other stringed instruments. *Piano music. *Drum parts. * Song Books, Hymn sheets etc. (with lyrics, vocal lines, chord symbols, accompaniment etc.). * Music lessons and other educational material.  General usage  Scores are created by combining various lines (music staffs, Tablature, text lines, chord diagrams etc.) into ‚ÄúLine groups‚Äù, which are in effect \\"score systems\\". MusEdit acts like a \\"word-processor for music\\", with a system of keyboard shortcuts and a ‚Äúsymbols toolbox‚Äù allowing music and text to be entered quickly and easily. Many functions (including note spacing) are under full manual control rather than being automated. Operations such as select, copy, cut and paste etc. are analogous to those of a standard word- processor. The position of many elements of the score can be finely adjusted by \\"nudging\\" (with the keyboard cursors) both horizontally and vertically - this includes text, accidentals, ties and notes of a 1/4 and above. In addition, the user can adjust the length and shape of individual slurs and ties. MusEdit supports linked Music Staff / TAB systems which means that notes entered onto the music staff appear also in the linked TAB line and vice versa. This is particularly useful for guitarists and other stringed instrument players. The full range of guitar symbols and notation is also supported. Instruments in any tuning with up to 8 strings can be notated.

ECAD history  ECAD was founded in August 1982 by Paul Huang and Glen M. Antle, who had worked at Texas Instruments, ITT, Teledyne, Data General, and (just before founding ECAD), the microelectronics products division of Systems Engineering Laboratories (SEL) in Sunnyvale, California. While developing a new computer design at SEL, the CAD group wrote a new (and very fast) algorithm for Design rule checking (DRC). These ideas eventually became the basis of ECAD's products. In 1982, SEL was acquired by Gould Inc., and part of the CAD group spun out as ECAD. ECAD's first product was Dracula, introduced in April 1983. It included a design-rule checker, an electrical rule checker, and a layout-versus-schematic consistency checker among other programs. This was followed by SYMBAD, an IC layout product suite.

A colliery labourer who went on to own several coal mines, he later bought a wire rope manufacturing company which manufactured the first Transatlantic telegraph cable. He was also a Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP). Early life George Elliot - often known in the Durham coalfield as Bonnie Geordie - was born in Gateshead, County Durham, on 18 March 1814, the eldest son of Ralph Elliot, a coal miner and Elizabeth, daughter of Henry Braithwaite, of Newcastle upon Tyne. Mining career At the age of 9, living in Shiney Row, he was a trapper boy at Whitefield Pit at Penshaw where underground he would open the doors when the miners came along with the tubs. He used a quarter of his wages here to fund evening classes.Houghton Hillside Cemetery. Accessed 18 June 2016. In 1831 he was a union leader in a strike over the length of the working day.George Elliot Grace‚Äôs guide to British industrial history. Accessed 18 June 2016 and in about 1832 he was apprenticed to Thomas Sopwith, a leading Tyneside mining engineer and land surveyor, and was involved in investigating coal resources in the Forest Of Dean and surveying the line of the Great North of England Railway between Darlington and York. In 1837 he returned to Whitefield as overman and in 1841 became under-manager at Monkwearmouth pit, and then manager in 1844 at the age of 30. In the mid-1840s he became a managing partner in Washington colliery and in 1845 opened the Usworth mine. In 1848 he was appointed viewer to Lord Londonderry with responsibilities for collieries, railways and harbours - notably the development of Seaham Harbour - and in 1850 bought the Whitfield mine from him. In the 1860s he acquired further mines in North Wales, Staffordshire, and in Nova Scotia and then in 1863 formed a partnership which bought for ¬£365,000 all the South Wales coal mines of the late Thomas Powell. He then established the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Co (PDSC) which grew to be the largest coal company in South Wales. He was acting manager of the company until 1877 and extended the business, buying coal mines near Aberdare including the rich coal mine and ironworks of Crawshay Bailey. In 1873, with William Hunter of Sandhoe, he opened Kimblesworth Colliery near Durham. Elliot was keen to try new mining technologies and was an advocate of improved safety lamps, shaft detaching hooks, and coal-cutting machinery. He held trials on new methods of ventilation and made a major contribution to methods of mining coal simultaneously in adjacent seams. He was closely involved with professional activities in mining, being a founder member of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, a member of its council for many years and President in 1868‚Äì9.

He appeared as an expert witness before several government inquiries, and served on the Royal Commission on the coal industry that reported in 1871 and the Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines that reported in 1886. Shortly before his death in 1893 he proposed the amalgamation of collieries into a massive semi-public enterprise monitored by the Board of Trade, which would control output, fix prices, pay fair wages, and establish a miners‚Äô welfare fund.Griffin, C.

Political career At the 1868 general election, Elliot was elected Member of Parliament for North Durham. In 1873, with William Hunter of Sandhoe, he opened Kimblesworth Colliery. He lost his seat at Durham at the 1874 general election but regained it later in the year. He was created a baronet on 15 May 1874 in recognition of his work for public services. He advised Benjamin Disraeli to invest in the Suez Canal, which provided a faster shipping route to India. He was a financial adviser to the Egyptian Khedive (the viceroy under the Ottomans), and also received an honour from the King of Portugal ‚Äì the grand cross of the military order of Our Lady of Villa Viciosa. As an MP made arrangements for the new tongue of Big Ben, in Westminster, London, to be forged at Hopper's Iron Foundry in Houghton-le-Spring. In 1880 Elliot lost his seat at North Durham but regained it in a by-election in 1881. In 1885 the North Durham constituency was reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 and at the 1886 general election Elliot was elected MP for Monmouth Boroughs. He held the seat until 1892. George Hudson When the Railway King George Hudson was arrested for his debts in 1865 and imprisoned in York Prison it was Elliot who paid off the debt to enable his release. Elliot and Hugh Taylor (MP) were both friends of Hudson so when by 1871 he was deeply in debt, in bad health and living in exile they started a subscription fund which they launched with a donation of 100 Guineas each. When this closed it was converted into a trust fund (legally protected from Hudson's creditors) and provided Hudson with an income. Personal life George Elliot married Margaret Green of Rainton, Durham, in 1836, and they had two sons and four daughters. Margaret died in 1880, and he never remarried, but he was involved in a well-publicized breach of promise case ten years later when he was sued by Emily Mary Hairs, a professional singer, for ¬£5000 damages, but her claim was rejected by a jury. In 1874/5 he was president of Durham University Society and in 1876 he was Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons in South Wales. Elliot was keen on having memorials to his family. In 1877 he donated the 130 foot tall tower and spire of St Mary's Church, West Rainton, in memory of his daughter, Elizabeth, and in 1878 erected a stone tomb in the churchyard of All Saints‚Äô Church, Penshaw to his father, mother and brothers and also to his son Ralph Elliot who had died in 1873 aged 35 at the Cape of Good Hope. In 1889 he donated a stained glass window of the Baptism, Resurrection and Ascension to the same church. In 1882 he purchased land in Aberaman in South Wales as a gift in memory of his wife and daughter Elizabeth. Work then commenced on the construction of St Margaret's Church and it was completed in 1883. Elliot owned substantial estates in Monmouthshire and at Whitby, where in the 1870s he further developed the West Cliff area and had a house called ‚ÄúThe Crescent‚Äù built. Elliot was visited at his residence at the Royal Crescent in Whitby by Bram Stoker.

Plot Tom (Steven Mackintosh), a middle class working employee, finds himself at rock bottom after he loses his job and his girlfriend in the same week. Believing that he has no choice but to end it all, Tom ventures into a derelict squat in East London, in an attempt to purchase a gun from homeless crack addict D (Ashley Walters). However, D attempts to extort more than the agreed price, in order to pay off his debt to local drug dealer Hoodwink (Andy Serkis), to whom he owes a significant amount of money. However, the gun is not his to sell - it actually belongs to Hoodwink, who will do anything in his power to get it back. Tom's attempts to reason with Hoodwink leave him with more trouble than he bargained for - and trying to buy him off only gets him seriously abused. Despite trying unsuccessfully to shift the blame onto not-so-macho drug dealer Ray (Adam Deacon), Tom and D gradually get to know what makes each other tick - and digress for reasonable life - as they try to find a way out of the situation. However, with Hoodwink still on the warpath, the day soon becomes a cat and mouse game of survival for the pair.Sugarhouse Synopsis Cast *Steven Mackintosh as Tom *Ashley Walters as D *Andy Serkis as Hoodwink *Adam Deacon as Ray *Tolga Safer as Sef *Ade as Paul *Sharon D.

It is a public university located in Krak√≥w, Poland. It was founded soon after the conclusion of World War II, on May 11, 1946 originally as the National Higher College of Teacher Training. Its aim is the training of highly qualified teaching staff for the Polish educational system. Pedagogical University of Cracow The Pedagogical University is the earliest Pedagogical University in postwar Poland. It functions according to the model of integrated education combining theoretical knowledge with practical skills. The mission of the University is reinforced in scientific research and development according to the highest European standards in several dozen fields of studies. It runs first-cycle (Bachelor's) and second-cycle (Master's) degree programmes, as well as in the third-cycle degree studies (Ph.D.), and post-graduate study courses. History At the beginning, the Pedagogical Academy trained elementary school teachers; with the curriculum spanning over a period of 3 years. As early as in 1949, it began training secondary school teachers and was split into a new organizational structure based on departments. The academic posts were appointed, including those of the Senate, the Department Councils, the Rector, Vice-Rectors and the Deans. In 1954 the college received the title of a Higher College. Curriculum increased to 4 years and students graduated with a Master's degree. The Polish October political transformations of 1956 resulted in the college gaining significant autonomy. For the first time the Rector was elected and not nominated. The first elected Rector was Prof. dr Wincenty Danek. Under his administration, the Higher College of Teacher Training rapidly developed and earned even more reputation. From the academic year 1958/1959 studies were extended to 5 years. In 1959 the University received the right to offer doctorate degree programs and in 1967 the right to confer the degree of habilitated doctor. In 1989 a period of political and social transformations resulted in the Academy receiving complete independence and self-government. On October 1, 1999, the college was renamed to the Pedagogical Academy of Cracow of the National Education Commission (Akademia Pedagogiczna im. Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie). On October 3, 2008, the college was renamed to the Pedagogical University of Cracow of the National Education Commission (Uniwersytet Pedagogiczny im. Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie).

After studying at T√ºbingen and Bonn, where he made special studies in the exegesis of the Old Testament and in Oriental languages, he was ordained priest when twenty-eight years old. Soon after this he became assistant lecturer at T√ºbingen, and in 1840 regular professor of Old Testament exegesis. Works He published at Freiburg, in 1840, Historisch-kritische Enleitung in die hl. Schriften des alten Testamentes. Much of the material for this work had been gathered by his predecessor, Johann Georg Herbst, who left a request that Welte should finish and edit his notes. Welte was not in fact in sympathy with the method of Herbst; and at times found it necessary to append his own views and arguments. The second part of the same work began to appear in 1842. Two years later, a third volume, completing the task, published as Specielle Einleitung in die deutero-canonischen Bucher des alten Testamentes came from the pen of Welte alone. Before this, in 1841, the translation of Gorium's Armenian biography of St. Mesrob appeared in the university annual publication. In the same year he wrote Nachmosaisches im Pentateuch, contending that there was no post-Mosaic matter in the Pentateuch. His explanation and translation of the Book of Job was published at Freiburg, 1849. Meanwhile, in company with the orientalist Heinrich Joseph Wetzer, he had begun his real life-work. Together they edited the 12 volumes of the Kirchenlexikon, an encyclopedia of Catholic theology and its allied sciences. To this work Welte himself contributed 200 articles, and his literary activity closed with the completion of the encyclopedia. This was due partly to the duties of a canon's office which he assumed, 22 May 1857, at the cathedral of Rottenburg am Neckar, and partly to an incurable disease of the eyes.

The village is located in the Zadrna valley of the Central Sudetes, within the historic Lower Silesia region. It lies approximately south of Kamienna G√≥ra, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. It has a population of 1,400. History The Benedictine abbey of Grissobor was established on 8 May 1242 by Anne of Bohemia, widow of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia. It was located on the rim of the Silesian Przesieka, probably at neighbouring Krzesz√≥wek. At first a filial of the Bohemian Opatovice monastery, the estates were acquired by the Silesian duke Bolko I the Strict of ≈öwidnica‚ÄìJawor in 1292, himself a grandson of late Duke Henry II, who brought Cistercian monks from nearby Henryk√≥w and endowed them with suitable assets at Krzesz√≥w. The 14th century was marked as a period of impressive development and vast influence of Krzesz√≥w Abbey. Its estates comprised about 40 villages and the towns of Lubawka and Che≈Çmsko. Meanwhile, upon the death of Duke Bolko II the Small in 1368, the time of the ≈öwidnica‚ÄìJawor Piast line's extinction started its decline. The duchy was inherited by the Bohemian Crown and during the Hussite invasions and again during the Thirty Years' War, the abbey was totally destroyed and plundered. However, after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, a new prosperous period for the abbey began. Gr√ºssau, 19th century depiction Upon the First Silesian War, Gr√ºssau with Silesia was annexed by Prussia in 1742. In 1810 the estates were secularised and from 1815 were part of the Silesia Province. In 1945 it was conquered by the Red Army in the course of the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, upon the Potsdam Agreement, the area fell to the Republic of Poland and the remaining German population was expelled. The abbey was resettled with Benedictine nuns, themselves expelled from Lviv in former Polish Kresy. The buildings include the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the mausoleum of the ≈öwidnica-Jawor Piasts, the Church of St. Joseph, the abbey buildings, a guest house called the 'House of the Abbott', numerous calvary chapels and household buildings.

With over of manufacturing floor, it is the largest organ parts supplier in North America.  History  World's Fair in Philadelphia for centennial in 1876 Organ Supply Industries has its origins in two organ builders whom Erie investors encouraged to move their operations to Erie in the late 19th century. They include the Burdett Reed Organ Company, of Chicago, a reed organ manufacturer whose operation was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871; and the A. B. Felgemaker Organ Company, originally of Buffalo, New York. The Tellers-Kent Organ Company, sprang from two Felgemaker employees in 1906. A. B. Felgemaker sent Anton Gottfried and his colleague Henry Kugel from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Erie, where they set up shop in the Felgemaker plant. The A. Gottfried Organ Company relocated to its own Erie facilities in 1905. Gottfried and Kugel had previously worked for the Haskell Company, a prominent organ manufacturer in Philadelphia. Fred Durst, of Hinners Organ Company of Pekin, Illinois, joined as superintendent of A. Gottfried Organ Company in 1917. Harry Auch and John Hallas, of the Haskell Company, came to Erie in 1920 to join Gottfried, Kugel, and Kugel's son Harry Kugel in the formation of a metal organ pipe manufacturer called National Organ Supply. Durst and Henry Kugel's sons Harry and Ruben Kugel formed Organ Supply Corporation in 1924. The pipe manufacturing company was purchased by Organ Supply Corporation in 1958. Fred Gluck purchased the Organ Supply Corporation in the early 1970s and merged it with Durst and Company to form Durst Organ Supply Company, Incorporated. The name was changed to Organ Supply Industries, Incorporated in 1978.

Origins and early life Captain Martin Maginnis Maginnis was born in 1841 on his family's farm near Pultneyville, Wayne County, New York, to Patrick and Winnifred Devine Maginnis. His parents came from Ireland, his father from County Clare and his mother from Galway, and they met and married in Liverpool, England. After mixed success in business, Patrick and Winifred Maginnis immigrated to the United States in 1838 and settled in Wayne County, New York. Patrick worked as a contractor on the New York Central Railway. In 1851, the Maginnis family moved west to LaSalle, Illinois where Patrick worked on the Illinois Central railroad. The family next moved to Goodhue Township near Red Wing, Minnesota in 1853. Young Maginnis pursued an education in the public schools and in Minnesota he attended Hamline University, but left early to take charge of a Democratic newspaper. Maginnis had come to know William Wallace Phelps, a lawyer and part owner of the Red Wing Sentinel newspaper, and William J. Colvill, the first editor of the Sentinel. Colvill took young Maginnis under his wing, liberally sharing his library with him and enjoying together the abundant hunting and fishing in the area. By early 1861 Maginnis owned the Red Wing Sentinel, while Phelps edited. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted as a private in the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1861. Maginnis was promoted to first lieutenant in 1862, to captain in 1863 and to major of the 11th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment in 1864. He was ordered to join the Army of the Cumberland where he served under the command of General George H. Thomas until being mustered out along with his regiment in 1865. Montana Territory After the War, he moved to Helena, Montana with his brothers in 1866 where he engaged in mining and later in publishing and editing the Helena Daily Gazette. Maginnis was elected a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in 1872, serving from 1873 to 1885 as the territory's non- voting representative. Afterwards, he was unsuccessful in being elected back to the House of Representatives in 1890, was Commissioner of Mineral Land of Montana from 1890 to 1893 and presented his credentials as a Senator-designate in 1900 to fill a vacancy, but was not seated. Maginnis moved to Los Angeles, California for health reasons in 1915 where he died of gangrene of the foot on March 27, 1919. He was interred in Resurrection Cemetery in Helena, Montana.

The plot is loosely based on the western Destry Rides Again. Plot Frank Dawson is killed in the town of Bottleneck by his double-crossing partner Jack Lambert, leaving a young girl without a father. For the next 15 years, she lives in orphanages and works for the Fontaines, originally from Paris, earning her the nickname \\"Frenchie.\\" Now grown, she makes a fortune running a casino in New Orleans, then returns to Bottleneck to finally try to find her father's killer. She buys the casino the Scarlet Angel but learns that sheriff Tom Banning has cleaned up the town, forcing gamblers to go to nearby Chuckaluck, where the man in charge is Lambert. Frenchie gets in touch with Lance Cole, a man who helped her in New Orleans, and asks him to come to Bottleneck to run the Scarlet Angel with her. Lambert's gambling interests are threatened, so he plans to ambush Cole's stage. Tom intervenes and prevents bloodshed. Cole is in love with Frenchie and suspicious that Tom might be taking an interest in her. Tom's former fiancee, Diane, is jealous, too. She ended up marrying a rich banker, Clyde Gorman, only for his money. She and her husband rally the Bottleneck townspeople to get rid of these new gamblers in town. Frenchie visits her father's grave, seen by Tom, who guesses correctly that she is Dawson's daughter. He rides to Chuckaluck to prevent trouble, but Lambert tries to shoot him. The men of Bottleneck who want Frenchie gone head for the hills when she lies to them about a gold discovery there. Diane declares her love to Tom, who rejects her. Diane goes to the Scarlet Angel to confront Frenchie and lets it slip that her husband is Lambert's silent partner. The women get into a fight, which Tom breaks up. Frenchie now knows the identities of the two men who murdered her dad. When she decides against vengeance, Cole figures she won't kill Gorman because that would make Diane a widow, free to be with Tom. An unknown figure shoots Gorman in the back. Tom is accused and locked up in his own jail. Frenchie organizes a jailbreak, but Tom is suspicious because he thinks Frenchie could be setting him up to be gunned down by a posse. Lambert draws and Tom kills him in self-defense. When things look bleak for him, Diane confesses that it was she who killed her husband. Tom assumes that Frenchie will leave town now, but Frenchie goes into a cell, closes the door and throws away the key, letting Tom know she's not going anywhere.

Early life A native of San Antonio's Westside, Romo graduated from Fox Tech High School and attended the University of Texas at Austin on a track scholarship, where he was a member of the Texas Cowboyshttp://www.humanitiestexas.org/news/articles/dr-ricardo-romo-receives- distinguished-alumni-award and Lambda Chi Alpha.http://www.e-yearbook.com/yearbooks/University_Texas_Cactus_Yearbook/1967/Page_278.html Romo was the first Texas Longhorns athlete (and the 19th American in history) to break 4 minutes in the mile, running a time of 3 minutes, 58.8 seconds in 1966. The time set a school record that lasted 42 years. He holds a master's degree in history from Loyola Marymount University and a Ph.D. in history from UCLA. Romo is an urban historian and the author of \\"East Los Angeles: History of a Barrio,\\" which is now in its ninth printing (one was in Spanish). Early academic career In 1980, President Romo returned to UT Austin to teach history before becoming a vice provost for undergraduate education. From 1987 to 1993, Romo directed the Texas office of the Tomas Rivera Center, housed at Trinity University, where he evaluated the impact of governmental policies on Latinos. In 2002, George W. Bush appointed him to the President's Board of Advisers on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. In 2004, former Secretary of State Colin Powell appointed Romo as a U.S. representative to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization and in 2005 Romo was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, San Antonio branch. UTSA presidency Under Romo's leadership, \\"The UTSA Plan: A Roadmap to Excellence\\" was presented. The plan is a strategic effort to enhance both access to education and excellence in scholarship and service at UTSA. As a result, UTSA plans to more than double the current number of tenured and tenure-track faculty by 2012 and develop additional doctoral programs and research institutes. To accommodate future growth, UTSA plans to add nearly $750 million in new facilities, which includes an $84 million science and engineering building completed in 2005. In November 2007, he was recognized with the Isabel la Catolica award, the highest award given to non-Spanish subjects, bestowed by King Juan Carlos of Spain. In October 2008, he received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Texas Exes Alumni Association. During President Romo's tenure, enrollment increased more than 50% and the university implemented a nearly $46 million renovation to the Recreation and Wellness Center, a 1,000-bed Olympic village-style housing complex and several new student support programs. The number of advisers has tripled, and UTSA is recognized as a leader in \\"Closing the Gaps,\\" a statewide initiative by the Legislature to enroll more Texans in higher education. On February 14, 2017, Romo was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation into his conduct regarding how he greeted women in his office. Romo had planned to retire in August 2017 after almost two decades with the university. He announced his resignation, effective immediately, on March 3, 2017. \\"I have been made aware that the manner in which I embraced women made them uncomfortable and was inappropriate,\\" he said. Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff claimed that the University of Texas System had mishandled the investigation into his friend's conduct. Wolff said that he often embraces men and women in the workplace: \\"It's a tradition in the Hispanic community that you do that... It's just a tradition, one that I participate in.\\"Lauren Caruba and Silvia Foster-Frau, \\"Romo steps down as UTSA president: Leader had been under investigation\\", San Antonio Express-News, March 4, 2017, pp. 1, A14.

In the 2014-2015 academic year, Romo received a total compensation from UTSA in the amount of $530,704. The San Antonio Express-News questions details about the president's resignation: \\"The public may never be privy to the circumstances that prompted ... Romo to be placed on paid leave. Personnel issues are not subject to open records and disclosure laws. Details of such investigations become public only if lawsuits are filed ...\\", and suits are not anticipated in this case.\\"Romo's exit leaves public in the dark,\\" San Antonio Express-News, March 10, 2017, p.

His greatest achievement was the part he took in the production of the first edition of the Kirchenlexikon for which he drew up the Nomenclator and which he edited with Benedict Welte. He studied theology and Oriental languages at the universities of Marburg (1820-3), T√ºbingen (1823), and Freiburg (1824), and graduated as doctor of theology and philosophy at Freiburg in 1824. He continued the study of Arabic, Persian and Syriac for eighteen months at the University of Paris, under the Orientalists De Sacy and Etienne Marc Quatrem√®re.  Career  At the royal library of Paris he discovered an Arabian manuscript containing the history of the Coptic Christians in Egypt from their origin to the fourteenth century, which he afterwards edited in Arabic and Latin: \\"Taki-eddini Makrizii historia Coptorum Christianorum in √Ügypto\\" (Sulzbach, 1828). In 1828, Wetzer became professor-extraordinary, and in 1830 professor-ordinary, of Oriental philology at the University of Freiburg. Wetzer's interest in preserving the Catholic character of Freiburg, which had been founded and endowed as a Catholic university, incurred for him the odium of the Protestant professors, who, in the majority from 1846, excluded him from all academic positions. In 1850, Wetzer was appointed chief librarian of the university library. Wetzer composed anonymously the little work \\"Die Universit√§t Freiburg nach ihrem Ursprunge...\\" (Freiburg, 1844). He had also begun a history of the controversy between Arianism and the Catholic Church in the fourth century, but only a small part of it was completed and published as \\"Restitutio verae chronologiae rerum ex controversiis Arianis, inde ab anno 325 usque ad annum 350 exortarum...\\" (Frankfort, 1827).

It is native to eastern North America, where it is found in open areas such as prairies and woodlands. Description Downy phlox is a perennial that grows high. The stems are upright and sometimes branched near the top. Leaves, stems, and sepals are covered with hairs and the plant is sticky to the touch. Leaves are long and narrow and have pointed tips; they can be up to long and wide. The flowers grow in rounded clusters up to at the top of stems. The stems have opposite leaves. Each flower has five lobes (petals) that are pale pink, lavender, or purple, and is across. File:Downy phlox and prairie dock.jpg|Downy phlox blooming in its natural habitat, in a Wisconsin prairie. (The large-leafed plant is Silphium terebinthinaceum.) Ecology The flowers produce pollen on anthers near the end of the corolla tube, and nectar at the bottom of the corolla. Only butterflies, moths, skippers, and very long-tongued bees (the largest bumblebees) have long enough tongues to reach the nectar. Shorter-tongued bees and flower flies visit to feed on or gather pollen. It is a larval host to the phlox moth (Schinia indiana). The flowers are self-incompatible. Unless they are cross-pollinated, they will not produce any seed. Butterflies, skippers, and moths are the most effective pollinators. As they insert their proboscis into the corolla tube, it touches the anthers and picks up pollen. When they roll up their proboscis and move to the next flower, some pollen remains and is transferred to the stigma as they insert their proboscis into the next flower.

Until the 1930s, virtually every car had a structural frame separate from its body. This construction design is known as body-on-frame. Over time, nearly all passenger cars have migrated to unibody construction, meaning their chassis and bodywork have been integrated into one another. Nearly all trucks, buses, and most pickups continue to use a separate frame as their chassis. Functions The main functions of a frame in motor vehicles are: # To support the vehicle's mechanical components and body # To deal with static and dynamic loads, without undue deflection or distortion. :These include: ::*Weight of the body, passengers, and cargo loads. ::*Vertical and torsional twisting transmitted by going over uneven surfaces. ::*Transverse lateral forces caused by road conditions, side wind, and steering the vehicle. ::*Torque from the engine and transmission. ::*Longitudinal tensile forces from starting and acceleration, as well as compression from braking. ::*Sudden impacts from collisions. Types of frame according to their construction: * Ladder-type frame * X-Type frame * Offset frame * Offset with cross member frame * Perimeter Frame Frame rails Pickup truck frame. Notice hat-shaped crossmember in the background, c-shape rails and cross member in center, and a slight arc over the axle. Typically the material used to construct vehicle chassis and frames is carbon steel; or aluminum alloys to achieve a more light-weight construction. In the case of a separate chassis, the frame is made up of structural elements called the rails or beams. These are ordinarily made of steel channel sections, made by folding, rolling, or pressing steel plate. There are three main designs for these. If the material is folded twice, an open-ended cross-section, either C-shaped or hat-shaped (U-shaped) results. \\"Boxed\\" frames contain chassis rails that are closed, either by somehow welding them up or by using premanufactured metal tubing. C-shape By far the most common, the C-channel rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle at one time or another. It is made by taking a flat piece of steel (usually ranging in thickness from 1/8\\" to 3/16\\", but up to 1/2\\" or more in some heavy-duty trucks) and rolling both sides over to form a C-shaped beam running the length of the vehicle. Hat Hat frames resemble a \\"U\\" and may be either right-side-up or inverted with the open area facing down. They are not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust. However, they can be found on 1936‚Äì1954 Chevrolet cars and some Studebakers. High-performance custom frame, using boxed rails and tube sections Abandoned for a while, the hat frame regained popularity when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars, effectively creating a boxed frame. Boxed Originally, boxed frames were made by welding two matching C-rails together to form a rectangular tube. Modern techniques, however, use a process similar to making C-rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet. In the 1960s, the boxed frames of conventional American cars were spot-welded in multiple places down the seam; when turned into NASCAR \\"stock car\\" racers, the box was continuously welded from end to end for extra strength. Design features Pickup truck chassis holding the vehicle's engine, drivetrain, suspension, and wheels While appearing at first glance as a simple form made of metal, frames encounter great amounts of stress and are built accordingly. The first issue addressed is \\"beam height\\", or the height of the vertical side of a frame. The taller the frame, the better it is able to resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame. This is the reason semi-trucks have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker. As looks, ride quality, and handling became more important to consumers, new shapes were incorporated into frames. The most visible of these are arches and kick-ups. Instead of running straight over both axles, arched frames sit lower‚Äîroughly level with their axles‚Äîand curve up over the axles and then back down on the other side for bumper placement. Kick-ups do the same thing without curving down on the other side and are more common on front ends. Another feature are tapered rails that narrow vertically or horizontally in front of a vehicle's cabin. This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much of a load as the back. Design developments include frames that use more than one shape in the same frame rail. For example, some pickup trucks have a boxed frame in front of the cab, shorter, narrower rails underneath the cab, and regular C-rails under the bed. On perimeter frames, the areas where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames, so that section is boxed in, creating what are known as \\"torque boxes\\". Types Ladder frame Ladder chassis with diagonal cross-bracing and lightening holes Named for its resemblance to a ladder, the ladder frame is one of the simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction. It is now seen mainly on trucks. This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. The vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it. Unibody The terms \\"unibody\\" and \\"unit-body\\" are short for \\"unitized body\\", or alternatively \\"unitary construction\\". It is defined as: Vehicle structure has shifted from the traditional body-on-frame architecture to the lighter unitized body structure that is now used for most cars. Integral frame and body construction requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame. In a fully integrated body structure, the entire car is a load-carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle ‚Äì forces from driving as well as cargo loads. Integral-type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together by forming or casting whole sections as one piece, or by a combination of these techniques. Although this is sometimes also referred to as a monocoque structure, because the car's outer skin and panels are made load-bearing, there are still ribs, bulkheads, and box sections to reinforce the body, making the description semi-monocoque more appropriate. The first attempt to develop such a design technique was on the 1922 Lancia Lambda to provide structural stiffness and a lower body height for its torpedo car body. The Lambda had an open layout with unstressed roof, which made it less of a monocoque shell and more like a bowl.1,000 were produced. A key role in developing the unitary body was played by the American firm the Budd Company, now ThyssenKrupp Budd. Budd supplied pressed-steel bodywork, fitted to separate frames, to automakers Dodge, Ford, Buick, and the French company, Citro√´n. In 1930, Joseph Ledwinka, an engineer with Budd, designed an automobile prototype with full unitary construction. Citro√´n purchased this fully unitary body design for the Citro√´n Traction Avant. This high volume, mass production car was introduced in 1934 and sold 760,000 units over the next 23 years of production. This application was the first iteration of the modern structural integration of body and chassis, using spot welded deep stamped steel sheets into a structural cage, including sills, pillars and roof beams. In addition to a unitary body with no separate frame, the Traction Avant also featured other innovations such as four-wheel independent suspension, and front-wheel drive. The result was a low-slung vehicle with an open, flat-floored interior. For the Chrysler Airflow (1934‚Äì1937) Budd supplied a variation ‚Äì three main sections from the Airflow's body were welded into what Chrysler called a bridge-truss construction. For the Chrysler Airflow, unfortunately, this method was not ideal ‚Äì panel fits were poor. To convince a skeptical public of the strength of unibody, both Citro√´n and Chrysler created advertising films showing cars surviving after being pushed off a cliff. Opel was the second European and the first German car manufacturer to produce a car with unibody structure ‚Äì production of the compact Olympia started in 1935. A larger Kapit√§n went into production in 1938, although its front longitudinal beams were stamped separately and then attached to the main body. The streamlined 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr with conventional front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout utilized a unibody structure. By 1941, unit construction was no longer a new idea for cars, \\"but it was unheard of in the [American] low-price field [and] Nash wanted a bigger share of that market.\\" The single unit body construction of the Nash 600 provided weight savings and Nash's Chairman and CEO, George W. Mason was convinced \\"that unibody was the wave of the future.\\" Since then more cars were redesigned to the unibody structure, which is now \\"considered standard in the industry\\". By 1960, the unitized body design was used by Detroit's Big Three on their compact cars (Ford Falcon, Plymouth Valiant, and Chevrolet Corvair). After Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form American Motors Corporation, its Rambler-badged automobiles continued exclusively building variations of the unibody. Although the 1934 Chrysler Airflow had a weaker than usual frame and body framework welded to the chassis to provide stiffness, in 1960, Chrysler moved from body-on-frame construction to a unit-body design for most of its cars. Most of the American-manufactured unibody automobiles used torque boxes in their vehicle design to reduce vibrations and chassis flex, with the exception of the Chevy II which had a bolt-on front apron (erroneously referred to as a subframe). American Motors (with its partner Renault) during the late 1970s incorporated unibody construction when designing the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) platform using the manufacturing principles (unisides, floorpan with integrated frame rails and crumple zones, and roof panel) used in its passenger cars, such as the Hornets and all-wheel-drive Eagles for a new type of frame called the \\"Uniframe [...] a robust stamped steel frame welded to a strong unit-body structure, giving the strength of a conventional heavy frame with the weight advantages of Unibody construction.\\" This design was also used with the XJC concept developed by American Motors prior to its absorption by Chrysler, which later became the Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ). The design is still in use in modern-day sport utility vehicles such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. The unibody is now the preferred construction for mass-market automobiles and crossovers. This design provides weight savings, improved space utilization, and ease of manufacture. Acceptance grew dramatically in the wake of the two energy crises of the 1970s, and that of the 2000s in which compact SUVs using a truck platform (primarily the USA market) were subjected to CAFE standards after 2005 (by the late 2000s truck-based compact SUVs were phased out and replaced with crossovers). An additional advantage of a strong-bodied car lies in the improved crash protection for its passengers. Backbone tube A backbone chassis is a type of automobile construction chassis that is similar to the body-on-frame design. Instead of a two-dimensional ladder-type structure, it consists of a strong tubular backbone (usually rectangular in cross-section) that connects the front and rear suspension attachment areas. A body is then placed on this structure. X-frame Rolling X-frame chassis This is the design used for the full-size American models of General Motors in the late 1950s and early 1960s in which the rails from alongside the engine seemed to cross in the passenger compartment, each continuing to the opposite end of the crossmember at the extreme rear of the vehicle. It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps, since each row had to cover frame rails as well. Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame, but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame. The X-frame was claimed to improve on previous designs, but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side- impact and collision protection. This design was replaced by perimeter frames. Perimeter frame Bertone FW11 prototype with perimeter frame Similar to a ladder frame, but the middle sections of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and rear rails just behind the rocker and sill panels. This was done to allow for a lower floor pan, especially at the passenger footwells, to lower the passengers' seating height and therefore reduce the overall vehicle height in passenger cars. This became the prevalent design for body-on-frame cars in the United States, but not in the rest of the world until the uni-body gained popularity. It allowed for annual model changes introduced in the 1950s to increase sales, but without costly structural changes. There are no perimeter frame passenger automobiles sold in the United States after the Ford Motor Company phased out the Panther platform in 2011, which ended the perimeter frame passenger car in the United States. The Chevrolet Corvette has used a variation of the perimeter frame since 1963, but its fourth-generation variant to its current generation as of 2016 has elements of the perimeter frame integrated with an internal skeleton which serves as a clamshell. In addition to a lowered roof, the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable, and offers better safety in the event of a side impact. However, the design lacks stiffness, because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance, and is used in combination with torque boxes and soft suspension settings. Platform frame This is a modification of the perimeter frame, or of the backbone frame, in which the passenger compartment floor, and sometimes also the luggage compartment floor, have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts, for strength and rigidity. The sheet metal used to assemble the components needs to be stamped with ridges and hollows to give it strength. Platform chassis were used on several successful European cars. The most well- known of this is the Volkswagen Beetle, on which it is called body-on-pan construction. Another German example are the Mercedes-Benz \\"Ponton\\" cars of the 1950s and 1960s, where it was called a \\"frame floor\\" in English-language advertisements. The French Renault 4, of which over eight million were made, also used a platform frame. The frame of the Citroen 2CV represents a more minimal interpretation of a platform chassis. Space frame Jaguar C-Type frame In a (tubular) spaceframe chassis, the suspension, engine, and body panels are attached to a three-dimensional skeletal frame of tubes, and the body panels have little or no structural function. To maximize rigidity and minimize weight, the design makes maximum use of triangles, and all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compressive, never bending, so they can be kept as thin as possible. The first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the 1930s by Buckminster Fuller and William Bushnell Stout (the Dymaxion and the Stout Scarab) who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design. The 1951 Jaguar C-Type racing sports car that won the Le Mans 24 hours twice, had a lightweight, multi-tubular, triangulated frame, over which an aerodynamic aluminum body was crafted. The Italian term Superleggera (meaning 'super-light') was trademarked by Carrozzeria Touring for lightweight sports-car body construction that only resembles a space-frame chassis. Using a three-dimensional frame that consists of a cage of narrow tubes that, besides being under the body, run up the fenders and over the radiator, cowl, and roof, and under the rear window, it resembles a geodesic structure. A skin is attached to the outside of the frame, often made of aluminum. This body construction is, however, not stress-bearing, and still requires the addition of a chassis. Subframe The Lamborghini Aventador has a carbon fibre central monocoque, with front and rear steel subframes, mounting the mechanicals A subframe is a distinct structural frame component, to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle's structure. Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque, the rigid subframe can handle high chassis forces and can transfer them evenly to a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a unitized body shell. Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars and are used to attach the suspension to the vehicle. A subframe may also contain the engine and transmission. It is normally of box steel construction, but may be tubular. Examples of passenger car use include the 1967‚Äì1981 GM F platform, the numerous years and models built on the GM X platform (1962), GM's M/L platform vans (Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari, which included an all-wheel drive variant), and the unibody AMC Pacer that incorporated a front subframe to isolate the passenger compartment from engine, suspension, and steering loads.

Design and development The Airedale was a four-seat, high- wing braced monoplane with a fixed, tricycle undercarriage, mainly of steel tube construction and fabric covered.Wenham 2015, pp. 53‚Äì54. It was originally designed as the Auster D.8 which was a modified tricycle version of the Auster D.6. Although similar in many respects, the Airedale was not based on the earlier Auster C.6 Atlantic design,Wenham 2015, p. 52. of which a single aircraft was built and flown in 1958 (registration G-APHT). The first three D.8 airframes were in construction when Beagle Aircraft bought the Rearsby- based Auster company in 1960. At this stage Beagle began introducing a series of major modifications to the D.8, which included moving the pilot's door aft and adding a second door on the right, widening the rear cabin, lengthening the rear fuselage and adding a swept fin, as well as many minor changesWenham 2015, p. 53. Following the first flight of the 1st prototype G-ARKE, seven further development and pre-production aircraft were flown.Wenham 2015, p. 55. As changes continued, these eight aircraft were repeatedly modified and rebuilt; these modifications continually added extra weight to the aircraft, and costs spiralled.Wenham 2015, pp. 57‚Äì59. Concerns about the weight, when it was suggested that \\"the increase in weight was resulting in a 2-seater aircraft\\", were ignored by the design team.Hitchman 2006, p. 32. The performance of the Airedale, although faster than the D.6 on the same engine, was decidedly lacklustre, largely due to its comparatively high structural weight, and it was unable to compete in the market with its US competitors. This was largely because of the out-dated steel tube/fabric construction,Wenham 2015, p. 62. compared to the more modern all-metal Piper Cherokee and Cessna 172 designs, but also the performance was worse and production quality was poor.Wenham 2015, p. 60. Beagle had retained the older construction method as development of monocoque techniques would have extended the design period; the Airedale itself took about four and a half months from starting on the design drawings to first flight. However, the benefit of this was entirely lost by the subsequent protracted development period. Additionally the Airedale proved expensive to manufacture with the production man-hours remaining higher than anticipated and consequently a higher price than the American imports.Wenham 2015, p. 59. It was also reported that dealers abroad only consented to buying a demonstrator Airedale as they wanted to be appointed as agents for the Beagle-Miles M.218 which they viewed as far more saleable.Wenham 2015, p. 97. A single Airedale, the first prototype (registration G-ARKE) was refitted (by Marshall's of Cambridge) with a Continental GO-300-E engine so that it could be part of the SBAC Display at the 1961 Farnborough Airshow, as the standard Airedale was not eligible on account of its US-built Lycoming O-360 engine. This model was designated A.111. Ostensibly this engine was made by Rolls-Royce under their new licence agreement but the engine came from the USA.Hitchman 2006, pp. 32‚Äì33. Whether this expenditure was justified by the publicity is debatable, and the performance was worse.Wenham 2015, p. 57. Production of the Airedale ceased in 1963 after production of only 43 aircraft, when it was calculated that the break-even figure could be as high as an unfeasible 675 aircraft. The Airedale took some 6,900 man-hours and ¬£2,037 in labour charges to build, against a selling price below ¬£5,000;Hitchman 2006, p64 at one stage in 1963, Beagle had 20 unsold Airedales. The Airedale and the Terrier were both built by Beagle as stop-gaps whilst more modern aircraft were designed, but both incurred significant losses, in the case of the Airedale almost ¬£500,000.Wenham 2015, p. 66. It appears that a decision in 1962 to continue production past the first 25 aircraft was only made due to the optimistic outlook and predictions of the Chairman, Peter Masefield.

History  King John VI of Portugal created the on 4 November 1801 in honour of Queen Saint Isabel, consort of Portuguese King Denis I, investing his wife Carlota Joaquina as Grand Mistress of the order. The order, limited to a total membership of twenty-six, is exclusively for Catholic noblewomen. In 5 October 1910, the monarchy was replaced by a republic. The order, which was considered dynastic, continued to be bestowed by King Manuel II of Portugal, who in exile also awarded it to his wife. After his death, the Queen and Queen Mother both continued to use the order's insignia of Grand Mistress. In 1986 Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza re-established the Order of Saint Isabel as an honorific dynastic order of the Portuguese Royal Family, and claimed its Sovereign Grand Mastership. The Duchess of Braganza is the current Grand Mistress and, besides honouring Portuguese noblewomen on the Saint's feast day, celebrated each year on 4 July at the Monastery of Santa Clara-a-Nova in Coimbra, the Royal House has, since 2000, bestowed it on various queens, princesses and women dedicated to the support of Portuguese charities.  Insignia  The order's sash is pale pink and has a white stripe in the middle. On the accompanying crowned medallion is a picture of the Queen Saint giving money to a poor man. This picture is surrounded by a frame with roses (an allusion to the Queen's miracle). The insignia's motto is Pauperum Solatio.

It lies approximately southwest of Nysa and southwest of the regional capital Opole. It was the ancestral village of Nicolaus Copernicus (born Niclas Koppernigk), whose great-grandfather had moved to then Polish capital Cracow (Polish Krak√≥w, German Krakau) in c. 1380.see e.g. Jan Adamczewski, The Towns of Copernicus (1972), p. 12. The question of the ancestral Silesian origin of Copernicus' family was established by Georg Bender (\\"Heimat und Volkstum der Familie Koppernigk (Coppernicus)\\", Darstellungen und Quellen zur schlesischen Geschichte 27 (1920). Bender established the family's origin from K√∂ppernig near Nysa over the competing suggestion of their possible origin from K√∂pprich (sometimes [erroneously?] written K√∂ppernick) near Neurode (modern Przyg√≥rze). The surname Kopernik is recorded in Krakau from as early as 1350; The earliest known ancestor of Nicolaus Copernicus is his great-grandfather, Johan Kopernik, who received Krakau citizenship in 1386. Jack Repcheck, Copernicus' Secret: How the Scientific Revolution Began (2007), p. 31. The etymology of the name has been debated especially in the context of the biography of Copernicus, since at least the 1870s, surrounding two competing proposals, one suggesting the name root origin from the German word for copper (Kupfer), the other from the Polish word for dill (koper). Magazin f√ºr die Literatur des Auslandes, 1875, 534f. The dispute became virulent in the 1960s, culminating in a controversy between E. Mosko (\\"copper\\") and S. Rospond (\\"dill\\") during 1963/4, summarized by Zygmunt Brocki, \\"Wsr√¥d publikacji o etymologii nazwiska Mikotaja Kopernika [Among the publications on the etymology of the name of Nicholas Copernicus]\\" Komunikaty mazur.-warm., 1970). The suffix -nik (or plural -niki) denotes a Slavic and Polish agent noun. It is first mentioned in 1272, as Coprnih.diecezja.opole.pl and in 1284 was listed as one of 65 major German settlements in the Duchy of Nysa. As part of the Duchy of Nysa, it passed from the rule of Silesian branch of the Polish Piast dynasty to the Crown of Bohemia in 1342, and with Bohemia to the House of Habsburg in 1542. In 1742, it fell to Prussia as part of the settlement following the First Silesian War. In 1945, it became part of Poland, as Koperniki. The German population was displaced, and the village was re-populated with Polish settlers from Wiktor√≥wka (Tarnopol Voivodeship) and Jele≈õnia.Vgl.

The first of Apple's applications to sport this look was the QuickTime Player released as part of QuickTime 4.0 in 1999. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines state that the brushed metal interface should be used for programs that mimic the operation of, or interface with, common devices. Older versions (before 5.0) of iTunes and the Panther and Tiger Calculator both use brushed metal because they mimic real-world devices, while iSync features the theme because it interfaces with PDAs. Besides the metal appearance, brushed metal has a few functional differences from other types of Aqua. Brushed metal windows can be moved by clicking any part of the window background which is not occupied by a control; Aqua windows can only be moved by clicking within the title bar. Continuing the growth of Apple-sponsored, non-Aqua themes, Apple also introduced a Pro theme that is used in its high-end video, music and image production and editing software. At the same time, with the release of Mac OS X v10.4 and new iLife applications, Brushed metal was being slowly replaced with a darker Aqua theme, often dubbed Polished Metal. Mac OS X v10.5 fully replaced brushed metal with the new darkened Aqua theme, finally restoring a consistent look and feel to Mac OS X. Brushed metal was criticised by user interface purists, who pointed out that Apple frequently violates its own rules for the use of the brushed metal look. The most notable of the supposed violations are Safari, Apple's web browser, and the Macintosh Finder itself. With the release of Mac OS X v10.3, Apple further expanded its list of acceptable uses for brushed metal to include windows that navigate lists of information. This expanded definition includes the Finder, but Safari's use of brushed metal remains a mystery. Opponents of the theory point out that even Apple's guidelines for the use of brushed metal are inconsistent, and that the motivation behind the alternative appearance's existence is unclear.

Drawing on his early childhood influences of American Folk artists such as Bob Dylan, John Denver, and Willie Nelson, Frank Hannon has showcased his lyrical, vocal, and \\"acoustic\\" storytelling song writing abilities on the self-produced album. Apart from recent Tesla concerts, Frank Hannon has been performing solo \\"acoustic\\" shows, one in particular was the KGGO \\"Summer Jam\\" in Des Moines Iowa where he performed throughout the day in between artist such as John Waite, 38 special, and BTO in front of 10,000 fans singing by himself with an acoustic guitar, and recently performing with Aaron Lewis who is also known for such solo acoustic performances. Frank has recently formed the independent label RedHawk Records. Biography The story is that Frank broke his leg one summer and learned to play guitar while he was in a cast.Jeff Keith's brother in law, Wayne christopher Hannon started playing guitar and writing songs when he was 10 (1976). He joined/started the band Tesla at age 19 but had also played with and produced many artists. He uses guitars such as Gibsons preferably his '96 Cherry SG, ES 335, Les Paul Goldtops, Doubleneck 12/6 strings and acoustics and he uses a Dove, J50. Hannon later learned to play piano from his mother at a young age. He also played the B3 organ, Bass Guitar and Drums. As the years rolled when Tesla started he and other bandmates met Jeff Keith on a local radio station. He has recorded and performed with many musicians over the last 20 years. He formed the Frank Hannon Band with Robbie Furiosi, Joel Krueger, and Billy Raney. Others that he has played with include Dickey Betts, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Moe, Def Leppard, Roger Fisher, Gary Hoey, Steve Morse, Jeff Watson, Night Ranger, Eric Martin, Y&T;, Jon Anthony, Jackyl, Skid Row, Scott West, Cortney DeAugustine, Rogue, Pat Travers, and Kevin Hampton. Hannon formed a band called Moon Dog Mane, who released one album in 1998. In 2005 Hannon released his first solo effort Guitarz from Marz, released exclusively through his website frankhannon.com Frank played at Halftime Bar & Grill (formerly Coaches) in Rocklin for the Wounded Warriors Project (a benefit fund raiser for wounded soldiers) on Dec 31, New Year's Eve of 2010‚Äì2011 and made another New Year's Eve appearance in 2012‚Äì2013 with his new Frank Hannon Band line up, Aaron Leigh (bass), Cortney DeAugustine (drums). The sessions included songs from his newly released album Six String Soldiers, a project written and produced with Dickey Betts, Pat Travers, Dave Meniketti, Rick Derringer, Mike Araiza (guitarist from Albuquerque, NM) and lead vocalist Jeffery Sandoval (Albuquerque, NM).

It got its name from the Nairobi sheep disease that affects the gastrointestinal tracts of sheep and goats. The vast majority, and perhaps all viruses in this genus are tick-borne viruses that can have human or other vertebrate hosts.Crabtree, Mary B., Rosemary Sang, and Barry R. Miller. \\"Kupe Virus, a New Virus in the Family Bunyaviridae, Genus Nairovirus, Kenya.\\" Emerging Infectious Diseases 15 (2009): 147‚Äì54.  Structure  The virions for viruses in this genus have a spherical shape.\\"Nairovirus.\\" Nairovirus. Viral Zone. . They range in size from about 80‚Äì120 nm in diameter, with 50% of their weight attributed to proteins and 20‚Äì30% of their weight attributed to lipids.B√ºchen-Osmond, Cornelia. \\"00.011.0.03. Nairovirus.\\" ICTVdb Virus Descriptions. 25 Apr. 2006. International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. 17 Apr. 2009 . The ribonucleocapsid is filamentous, having a length of about 200-300 nm and a width of about 2‚Äì2.5 nm. These nucleocapsids are surrounded by a single envelope that has projections made of glycoproteins protruding from its surface. These projections evenly cover the surface of the virion, and are about 5‚Äì10 nm long. They aid in attachment to the host receptor in replication.  Genome  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genome Nairovirus genomes are negative sense, single-stranded RNA. The complete genome is about 17,100‚Äì22,800 nucleotides long, and is divided into three segments: large, medium, and small. The large segment is about 11000‚Äì14400 nucleotides long (11‚Äì14.4 kb), and it encodes the viral polymerase. The medium segment is about 4,400‚Äì6,300 nucleotides long (4.4‚Äì6.3 kb), and it encodes for glycoproteins G¬¨n and Gc. The small segment is about 1,700‚Äì2,100 nucleotides long (1.7‚Äì2.1 kb), and it encodes the nucleocapsid protein. The genome has terminally redundant sequences, with the sequences being repeated at both ends. The terminal nucleotides are base-paired forming, non-covalently closed, circular RNA. Both the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô ends have conserved regions, 9 nucleotides in length. The sequences are, 5‚Äôend: UCUCAAAGA, and 3‚Äôend: AGAGUUUCU.  Replication  Nairovirus life cycle Nairoviruses attach to the host receptor by their Gn-Gc glycoprotein dimer. The virus is then endocytosed into the host cell via a vesicle. The ribonucleocapsid segments are released into the cytoplasm, commencing transcription. Transcription and replication occur within the cell, and the newly synthesized virions are released by budding.  Transmission and distribution  Members of this viral genus infect many different vertebrate hosts, and are transmitted via ticks. Members of the genus Nairovirus may be found the world over, wherever their arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts are found together.  Clinical importance  Only four viruses in this genus have, to date, been recognised as human pathogens: * Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus * Dugbe virus * Nairobi sheep disease virus * Kasokero virus. A fifth‚Äî Erve virus ‚Äîmay also be pathogenic for humans. Evolution Phylogenetic analysis has shown that these viruses fall into two major monophyletic groups, the hard (Ixodidae) and soft (Argasidae) tick-vectored groups.Honig JE, Osborne JC, Nichol ST (2004) The high genetic variation of viruses of the genus Nairovirus reflects the diversity of their predominant tick hosts. Virology 318(1):10-16 Fossil and phylogenetic data places the hard tick-soft tick divergence between and . This suggests that the Nairoviruses have been associated with these ticks for over 100 million years. Additionally, nairoviruses vectored by ticks of the genera Argas, Carios and Ornithodoros form three separate monophyletic lineages, again supporting the suggestion of host-virus cospeciation. The hard bodied tick serogroups are * Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever * Nairobi sheep disease * Sakhalin * Tamdy The soft bodied tick serogroups are * Hughes * Dera Ghazi Khan * Qalyub The tick vectors for the Kasokero and Thiafora serogroups are not currently known. Taxonomy Nairobi sheep disease orthonairovirus (NSD) is the prototype virus of the genus.Clerx, John PM, Jordi Casals, and David HL Bishop. \\"Structural Characteristics of Nairoviruses (Genus Nairovirus, Bunyaviridae).\\" Journal of General Virology 55 (1981): 165‚Äì78.

Slender lorises spend most of their life in trees, traveling along the top of branches with slow and precise movements. It is found in tropical rainforests, scrub forests, semi-deciduous forests, and swamps. The species have lifespans of 15 years and are nocturnal. Slender lorises generally feed on insects, reptiles, shoots of plants, and fruits.  Taxonomy  The gray slender loris, Loris lydekkerianus, is found in India and Sri Lanka. The type species was named Lemur tardigradus by Linnaeus in 1758. The name Loris is first reported Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1765, representing the Dutch loeris meaning \\"clown\\". According to Buffon, the name loeris had been in use for some time by Dutch naturalists for the \\"sloths of ceylon\\". Osman Hill, W.C.. Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy. Strepsirhini. Edinburgh, Scotland: Edinburgh University Press, 1952, 44f. The genus Loris was separated from lemurs by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1796), based on a suggestion of a Lorican genus by Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton (1792). Saint- Hilaire's Loris at first included Daubenton's type species, Loris de Buffon, which he however delegated to the new Nycticebus genus in 1812.Catalogue m√©thodique de collection des Mammif√®res, Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle (1851), p. 78. * Family Lorisidae ** Subfamily Perodicticinae: African lorisids *** Genus Arctocebus: angwantibos *** Genus Perodicticus: the potto *** Genus Pseudopotto: the false potto ** Subfamily Lorisinae: Asian lorisids *** Genus Loris **** Red slender loris, Loris tardigradus **** Gray slender loris, Loris lydekkerianus *** Genus Nycticebus: slow lorises The red slender loris, Loris tardigradus, is found in Sri Lanka. In India, slender lorises are known as they are known as devanga-pilli (\\"‡∞¶‡±á‡∞µ‡∞æ‡∞Ç‡∞ó ‡∞™‡∞ø‡∞≤‡±ç‡∞≤‡∞ø\\") or arawe-papa in Telugu, kaadu-paapa (\\"‡≤ï‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥Å ‡≤™‡≤æ‡≤™\\") in Kannada, and wanur-manushiya in Marathi. In Sri Lanka they are known as () in Sinhala, and in Tamil, spoken across southern India and Sri Lanka, they are known as kutti thevangu (\\"‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ\\" \\"‡¥ï‡µÅ‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ø‡¥§‡µá‡¥µ‡¥æ‡¥ô‡µç‡¥ï‡µç\\") ‡Æµ‡Ææ(‡Æµ‡Ææ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ) ‡Æµ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ(‡Æô‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ)), kattu-papa, Kadapapa, or theivangu (meaning \\"the slender-bodied one\\").  Physical characteristics  The red slender loris favors lowland rainforests (up to 700 m in altitude), tropical rainforests and inter-monsoon forests of the south western wet-zone of Sri Lanka. Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve harbors one of few remaining red slender loris populations, and is considered a biodiversity hotspot. The most common plant species eaten was Humboldtia laurifolia, occurring at 676 trees/ha, with overall density at 1077 trees/ha. H. laurifolia is vulnerable and has a mutualistic relationship with ants, providing abundant food for lorises.[5] Reports from the 1960s suggest that it once also occurred in the coastal zone, however it is now thought to be extinct there. The red slender loris differ from its close relative the gray slender loris in its frequent use of rapid arboreal locomotion. It forms small social groups, containing adults of both sexes as well as young animals. This species is among the most social of the nocturnal primates. During daylight hours the animals sleep in groups in branch tangles, or curled up on a branch with their heads between their legs. The groups also undertake mutual grooming and play at wrestling. The adults typically hunt separately during the night. They are primarily insectivorous but also eat bird eggs, berries, leaves, buds and occasionally invertebrates as well as geckos and lizards. To maximize protein and nutrient uptake they consume every part of their prey, including the scales and bones. They make nests out of leaves or find hollows of trees or a similar secure place to live in.  Threats  According to biologists, poaching activity has led to the steady decline of the species in Tamil Nadu. Native people have always believed that all parts of the slender loris have some medicinal or magical powers. This has contributed greatly to the decline of the slender loris. In addition, slender lorises are illegally smuggled to supply a growing exotic pet trade. Other threats include habitat loss, electrocution on live wires, and road accidents. Along the western region of Tamil Nadu, there is a vigorous clampdown on illegal poaching of slender lorises. Destruction of tropical rain forest habitat is also contributing to declines in population.

Design and development The prototype Bell Model 61 first flew on 3 March 1953; it had been designed to meet a United States Navy requirement for an anti-submarine warfare helicopter. In June 1950, the Model 61 was announced as the winner of the competition, and three XHSL-1 evaluation aircraft were ordered. The Model 61 had a rectangular-section fuselage structure and four-leg, six-wheel landing gear. It was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-2800 radial engine mounted in the aft fuselage. Crew included two pilots and two sonar operators. Because of the urgency of the requirement, low-rate production was ordered almost immediately after Bell received a contract for three XHSL-1s. The Navy eventually contracted for at least 160 production aircraft, including 18 intended for the British Royal Navy. Bureau Numbers were assigned for a total of 234. Because of development problems that resulted in poor schedule performance to the contract, only 50 were built. Although all were delivered, after service test and acceptance only a handful were used, for the development of airborne mine sweeping. The rest were delivered directly into storage and were subsequently struck off. Operational history The HSLs were not used operationally. Approximately seven were assigned to the U.S. Naval Air Mine Defense Unit at Panama City, Florida, for the development of airborne mine-sweeping, the first arriving in September 1956 and the last being struck off in early 1960.

It lies west from Halifax, roughly equidistant from Todmorden's town centre, which is to the southwest, and Hebden Bridge, which is 2 miles to the northeast, along the course of the River Calder. Eastwood falls within the Calder ward of Calderdale council. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, sources suggest that Eastwood's name was almost certainly taken from the Eastwoode family, who were local landowners active from the 13th to 17th centuries. Eastwood Old Hall is the former seat of this family, and remains as a landmark and manorhouse within the locality History Eastwood Old Hall is the ancient seat of the Eastwoode family The earliest reference for Eastwood is in 1286 when it was called Estwoode. The name was almost certainly taken from the Eastwoode family who owned local land from the 13th to 17th centuries, and lived in Eastwood Old Hall. In the 19th century, Eastwood was an important (and relatively wealthy) habitation with a considerable amount of industry, supported by its own railway station, which was used to support local mill workers and industrialists travel to towns as far as Rochdale and Manchester. Though today a small hamlet, Eastwood once contained its own school, chapel and cricket team. Eastwood family The family of Eastwood is thought to have given its name to the locality. Eastwood continues to be a common name in and around this part of northern England. Some members of this lineage included John Eastwood who fabricated Todmorden Mills in Toronto Canada. Governance From a very early time, Eastwood formed part of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Halifax. From 1894 until 1939, Eastwood, together with Heptonstall and parts of the south Pennines formed part of the Todmorden Rural District, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and from 1939 until 1974, lay within Hepton Rural District, also from the West Riding. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the West Riding of Yorkshire was abolished and Eastwood has since formed part of the metropolitan borough of Calderdale, in West Yorkshire. Eastwood forms part of the civil parish of Todmorden.

Life He attended the gymnasium in his native city, studied theology at the University of Bonn from 1846 to 1849, and was ordained priest at Cologne on 3 September 1850. For several years he was engaged on the mission in various stations of the Diocese of Cologne, until in 1859 he was appointed lecturer at the Konvikt or theological school at Bonn. In 1862 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of W√ºrzburg in virtue of a commentary on the Book of Jonas; in 1863 he obtained a chair of Old Testament exegesis at the University of Bonn; in 1880 and 1882 he was appointed extraordinary and ordinary professor of theology at the same university. In 1890 he was raised to the dignity of a domestic prelate by Pope Leo XIII; in 1900 he received the grand cross of the Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, and in 1903 he was made a member of the Biblical Commission. During the same year (1903) he was compelled to give up teaching owing to an apoplectic stroke. Works The study of the Bible was Kaulen's aim from the beginning. He kept it before his mind even when engaged in the ministry or in the conferences at the theological school of Bonn; and nearly all his works refer to it or kindred subjects. His principal works are: *\\"Lingu Mandschuric Institutiones\\", a grammar of the Manchu language (Ratisbon, 1875) * \\"Die Sprachverwirrung zu Babel\\", or the confusion of languages at Babel (Mainz, 1861) * \\"Librum Jonae exposuit Fr. Kaulen\\", or a commentary on the Book of Jonas (Mainz, 1862) * \\"Geschichte der Vulgata\\", or a history of the Vulgate (Mainz, 1861) *\\"Sprachliches Handbuch zur biblischen Vulgata\\", or a linguistic manual to the Latin Vulgate (Mainz, 1870) * \\"Einleitung in die Heilige Schrift Alten und Neuen Testamentes\\", or Introduction to the Sacred Scripture of the Old and New Testament (Freiburg, 1876‚Äì86) * \\"Assyrien und Babylonien\\" (1876) *\\"Der biblische Sch√∂pfungsbericht\\", or the Biblical account of the creation (Freiburg, 1902) *\\"Thomas von Villanova, ein B√ºchlein von der g√∂ttlichen Liebe\\", or a book on Divine love (Freiburg, 1872) *three books of devotion, \\"Alleluja\\", \\"Brot der Engel\\" or Bread of the Angels, and \\"Die ewige Anbetung\\" or the perpetual adoration. The grammar to the Vulgate, the \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Assyria and Babylon\\" passed through several editions. The work on Babel was attacked by August Friedrich Pott,J. Leopold, (1989), \\"The Last Battle over the Tower of Babel: The controversy between August Friedrich Pott and Franz Kaulen\\", in: J. Gessinger & W. von Rahden eds., Theorien vom Ursprung der Sprache, Berlin & New York: de Gruyter, vol. 11, 548-560. in an 1863 book Anti-Kaulen. A lasting monument of his theological learning is found in the second edition of the \\"Kirchenlexikon\\". The first edition of his work which comprised 11 volumes, a supplement, and a general index, was issued by the publishing firm of Benjamin Herder. A second edition soon appeared necessary: in 1877 the editorship was entrusted to Joseph Hergenr√∂ther, then professor in W√ºrzburg, but, at the elevation of the latter to the cardinalate in 1879, was finally given to Kaulen, who presided over the work until it was completed. The new or second edition comprises twelve volumes and a general index; the first volume appeared in 1886, the last in 1901, and the index, prepared by Hermann Joseph Kamp, with an introduction on the divisions of theology by Melchior Abfalter, in 1903. Kaulen was helped by Hermann Streber, by Albert Maria Weiss, O.P., who prepared the catalogue of subjects, and by a large number of learned contributors, the list of whom is given at the end of the last volume. The part taken by Kaulen consisted in editing the articles contributed, in revising several articles taken over from the first edition, and in contributing many articles of his own; the enumeration of his personal contributions fills almost five columns in the general list of contributors.

It has two tall chimneys. As of June 2010, the Ekibastuz GRES-1 power station was the largest power station in Kazakhstan, and generated 13% of the nation's electricity.  History  Most of the units were launched into service in the early 1980s. In January, 1996, due to mismanagement and disrepair, the capacity of the station dropped from 1,624 to 1,025 MWe, and further dropped to 655 MWe by June, 1996. Work at the station became hazardous: the equipment was not maintained, most of the control and emergency handling instrumentation was stolen from the power station. The units had to be frequently stopped because of break downs. From 1996 till 2008, the power station was owned by U.S.-based AES Corporation. By November, 1997, only three units were operational, producing 800 MWe on average. In the spring of 1998, all units except one were idle. The customers owed the power station about US$150 million of unpaid tariffs. In 1999, the average produced power was 215 MWe. In 2000, it was increased to 317 MWe after much needed repairs. As a result, the power station's generating capacity was increased from 1,050 to 1,200 MWe, but the problem of finding paying customers still resulted in low production levels. On 4 February 2008, AES agreed to sell the AES Ekibastuz power station to Kazakhmys. Under the terms of the management agreement AES continued to operate the station until December 2010. On 10 December 2009, Kazakhmys PLC announced that it would be selling a 50% stake in the power station to the National Welfare Fund Samruk- Kazyna for US$681 million. The transaction was completed on 26 February 2010. Kazakhmys and Samruk-Kazyna will create a joint supervisory board, and management positions will alternate between Kazakhmys and Samruk-Kazyna every five years. In the first five years following the transaction, Kazakhmys will appoint the management team whilst Samruk-Kazyna will appoint several key oversight positions. Over the next seven years the parties pledged to provide investment of around $1 billion at Ekibastuz, to upgrade the power station and restore it from its current capacity of 2,500 MW to its original nameplate capacity of 4,000 MW. In June 2010, a pair of contracts were announced with Emerson Electric Company to refurbish many of the control systems on units 3 through 8. This is estimated to take 5 years to complete and is expected to increase the efficiency of the affected units at the power station. Individual units Each of the eight units has a nameplate generating capacity of 500 MWe. : Unit 1 was launched into service in March, 1980. : Unit 2 was launched into service in October, 1980. : Unit 3 was launched into service in February, 1981. : Unit 4 was launched into service in November, 1981. : Unit 5 was launched into service in October, 1982. : Unit 6 was launched into service in May, 1983. : Unit 7 was launched into service in October, 1983. : Unit 8 Out of service until 2012 pending retrofit.

He died 10 November 1888. Ran Verlag Herder from 1856 until 1888. He was the brother of Karl Raphael Herder and the son of Bartholom√§us Herder Career Benjamin took charge of the publishing department until his brother's retirement in 1856, when he undertook the sole management. Equipped with a thorough, scholarly education, trained in the book business by his father and under Gauthier de Laguionie in Paris, Benjamin had had his views further broadened early in life by travels through Germany, Austria, France, England, and Italy. Of a character earnest and religious, he was strongly impressed by the Cologne troubles of 1837, and, as in the case of so many of his contemporaries, they gave a direction to his life, and in 1839, at the age of 21, he established a goal of helping to liberate and revive the Catholic Church in Germany. First of all he gradually abandoned fine-art publications in favour of book- publishing, being thus enabled to devote the full measure of his energies to the service of religious learning. Herein he displayed such activity in the encouragement of particular branches of erudition that the history of his theological publications, for instance, would comprise a considerable fragment of the history of modern theological literature, and the catechetical branch thereof would constitute one of the most important divisions of the history of catechetics. After theology Herder applied himself with the greatest zest to pedagogies, to the lives and learning of the saints as well as to other edifying biographies; also after a long and cautious delay to the publication of sermons. He next took up works dealing with the religious and political problems of the day, with questions of ecclesiastical policy and social controversies and issues. Finally, passing beyond the limits which previously Catholic literature had seldom ventured to transcend, he began the publication of works on the general sciences‚Äìhistory and philosophy, the natural sciences, geography, and ethnology, including the publication of atlases, school textbooks, music, art and its literature, the history of literature, and belles-lettres. His governing purpose throughout was to avoid wasting his energies on particular publications, but to build up the various branches gradually and systematically by the publication of more comprehensive \\"collections\\" and \\"libraries\\" and by the issue of scientific periodicals. The Kirchenlexikon (Church Lexicon) was the great centre of his fifty years' activity as a publisher. It was the first comprehensive attempt to treat everything that had any connexion with theology encyclopedically in one work, and also the first attempt to unite all the Catholic savants of Germany, in the production of one great work. Herder had nursed this project since 1840. When its appearance was made possible and its issue was begun in 1847 under the direction of Benedict Welte, exegete of T√ºbingen, and Heinrich Joseph Wetzer, Orientalist of Freiburg. After sixteen years of struggling and striving on the part of Herder, all obstacles were overcome, and the work was brought to completion in 1856, thanks chiefly to the support of Hefele. It had a decisive influence on the subsequent intellectual activity of Catholicism. While it was still in process of issue, Protestant scholars made use of Herder's scheme for the Real-Encyklop√§die f√ºr protestantische Theologie. It was sixteen years more before the preliminary work could be begun on the new edition, and ten years more before its publication could be started. While the historical element had been especially emphasized in the first edition, the dogmatic and exegetical side was expanded to equal dimensions in the second edition. The subjects to be treated were chosen by Adalbert Weiss, professor at the Freising lyceum, and the editorial chair was held by Joseph Hergenr√∂ther until his elevation to the cardinalate, and afterwards by Franz Philip Kaulen, the exegete of Bonn. The stupendous plan, which Benjamin had cherished since 1841, of building up a \\"Theologische Bibliothek\\" (Theological Library) according to an equally logical and symmetrical scheme, he was unable to realize until thirty years later. When the \\"Kirchenlexikon\\" was nearing completion, Herder sought, by the publication of the \\"Konversations-Lexikon\\" (Universal Encyclopedia, 1st ed., 1853-7), to make the Catholic public independent of the hostile literature which ruled unchallenged in the highly important domain of works of general information. Although, out of regard for the limited purchasing capacity of the Catholic public in Germany, he confined himself to the modest limits of five medium-sized volumes, still the undertaking was for his day a very courageous one. Of the very great number of other works published by him, we can draw attention only to the most notable, which spread the reputation of the house far beyond the limits of Germany. Among the earliest were the works of Alban Stolz, popular theologian and teacher, whose Kalender f√ºr Zeit und Ewigkeit achieved an extraordinary success. Alongside Stolz we find Ignaz Schuster, whose catechisms and Biblical histories, went round the world, like Stolz's works, in hundreds of thousands of copies, and up to twenty-five languages. Even before the completion of the \\"Kirchenlexikon\\" Hefele began his monumental \\"Conciliengeschichte\\". The strong religious revival that set in with the sixties was heralded by Franz Hettinger's pioneer work, the Apologie des Christentums, which set forth the religious teachings of Christianity to the cultured world in well-timed fashion, and which, reprinted again and again, and constantly improved, continues to exercise a potent influence in five foreign civilized languages even to this day. The \\"Apologien\\" of Weiss and Schanz were subsequently issued to support and supplement Hettinger's \\"Apologie\\". Of these works the one contrasts Christian life and its historical and cultural development with a purely worldly knowledge and the outlook of the age, while the other strives to harmonize the doctrines of the Church and the results of scientific research. The Encyclicals of December 1864, and the question of infallibility called forth in the pages of the \\"Stimmen aus Maria Laach\\" the comprehensive defence of the authority of the pope, as pastor and teacher, while the controversies concerning the Vatican Council occasioned Hergenr√∂ther's masterly \\"Anti-Janus\\", afterwards expanded and strengthened in the almost inexhaustible historico-theological essays, the \\"Katholische Kirche und christlicher Staat in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung und in Beziehung auf Fragen der Gegenwart\\". The \\"Stimmen\\", which at first appeared irregularly, inaugurated those relations between the house of Herder and the German Jesuits which have proved of so great importance to Catholic learning and Catholic life, and have kept the Jesuits in such close touch with their native country even while they were in exile during the persecution of the Kulturkampf. Of the abundant fruits of these relations we may mention the great \\"Collectio Lacensis\\" of the more recent councils, which displays a Benedictine industry in the collection of materials, and the \\"Philosophia Lacensis\\", nor can we forget the vigorous \\"Stimmen\\", which rapidly developed into the organ of the current intellectual movement, and its thoroughly stimulating and very instructive \\"Erg√§nzungshefte\\" (Supplementary Numbers), which already number more than one hundred. After the promulgation of the fundamental decrees of the Vatican Council, the Theologische Bibliothek was opened with Scheeben's Handbuch der Dogmatik. While the Kulturkampf was threatening to silence the expression of Catholic life, Janssen's Geschichte des deutschen Volkes began its triumphant course, and carried, for the first time, Catholic research into wide Protestant circles. The last ten years of Herder's existence crowned his life-work. Quite apart from the individual volumes of the various Collections and of the Apologies already mentioned, he produced, among other works, the \\"Real-Encyklop√§die der christlichen Alterth√ºmer\\" by F. X. Kraus, the new edition of the \\"Kirchenlexikon\\", Knecht's \\"Praktischer Kommentar zur biblischen Geschichte\\", the \\"Bibliothek f√ºr L√§nder- und V√∂lker-kunde\\", the \\"Jahrbuch der Naturwissenschaften\\", Pastor's \\"Geschichte der P√§pste\\", the \\"Staatslexikon der G√∂rres-Gesellschaft\\", the \\"Archiv f√ºr Literature und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters\\" by Denifle and Ehrle, and the \\"Bibliothek f√ºr katholische P√§dagogik\\". Thus Benjamin activity as a publisher mirrored the Catholic revival in Germany in the 19th century. He selected the themes for literary treatment. He personally discovered the majority. In no undertaking did he allow material gain to be the deciding factor; even in times of crisis‚Äìand of such he encountered more than one, beginning with the Baden uprising of 1848, right through the wars which raged between 1859 and 1871, down to the Kulturkampf which crippled the resources of both clergy and people‚Äìthe end in view alone determined his decision. Thoroughly alive to his grave responsibility as a publisher, he devoted extraordinary care to the training of capable and conscientious assistants. His partner, Franz Joseph Hutter (b. at Ravensburg, 25 November 1840) issued from the ranks of these \\"pupils\\". His essentially practical nature happily complemented Benjamin's idealism, which even repeated warnings had not been able to shake. New branches were established to open a wider market than the older establishments at Freiburg and Strasburg afforded. In 1873 were founded the St. Louis (U. S. A.) branch, under the management of Joseph Gummersbach, and the Munich branch under Herder's brother-in-law, Adolf Streber, and in 1886 that at Vienna, while enterprises of even greater promise were contemplated. In 1863 Herder married Emilie Streber, the accomplished daughter of Franz Seraph Streber, professor at the Munich University, and celebrated as a numismatist. His alliance with the Streber family introduced Herder to a circle of men who played an important part in the Catholic revival in Germany. It was also contemporaneous with a more active movement in the Church. He was handicapped throughout by great physical sufferings.

It is accepted as an official qualification notably by the Italian Ministry of Education and Research and the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is one of the qualifications used by foreigners to get entrance into any Italian university or higher education institution. The CELI qualification represents one of the many Italian Language Examinations and is often taken by applicants with immigration, work and study needs or for pure passion.  Origins  First introduced in 1987, the CELI qualification has been designed to offer high quality in Italian Language Examinations, coming from a university with a history from 1921 of offering Italian language and culture studies to foreign students. Thus, the Universit√† per Stranieri di Perugia is responsible for its creation, distribution, evaluation and awarding.  Qualification levels  * CELI UNO The first level examination tests basic Italian skills. A pass or fail are the results given once evaluation of the completed exam is finished. * CELI DUE The second level increases in difficulty from the first examination. Each component is weighted with 25 percent of the total marks and A, B and C (for pass) or D and E (for fail) grades are given upon evaluation. * CELI TRE The third level examination continues increasing in the difficulty of the Italian involved. Components take up unequal percentages of the total result with speaking carrying 30 percent, writing sharing 20 percent each with listening and reading accompanied by the 'structural competence' component. Grades from A to E are also awarded.  Qualification eligibility  The Qualification is open to all foreign applicants wishing to validate their abilities in Italian language once registered.  Procedure  An applicant wishing to obtain the CELI qualification must register and pay (prices varying) to sit the examination that seems suitable for them, at least two months before the official sitting of the exam. When an applicant has completed the exam (registering and sitting can be done through various streams leading to the university), the Universit√† per Stranieri di Perugia evaluates according to European Union guidelines and awards the official qualification, on average, three months after its sitting. Candidates who receive the qualification do so through successfully passing one of the examinations. The exams are held multiple times annually around the world. Many organisations throughout the world offer preparation courses and studies for the exams so candidates can be familiar with what is required.

The Transcoder/Rate Adaptation Unit (TRAU) is the data rate conversion unit. The PSTN/ISDN switch is a switch for 64 kbit/s voice. Current technology permits to decrease the bit-rate (in GSM radio interface it is 16 kbit/s for full rate and 8 kbit/s for half rate). Since MSC is basically a PSTN/ISDN switch its bit-rate is still 64 kbit/s. That is why a rate conversion is required in between the BSC and MSC... Transcoding is the compression of speech data from 64 kbit/s to 13/12.2/6.5 kbit/s in case FR/EFR/HR (respectively) speech coding. Rate adaptation without transcoding allows Tandem Free Operation (TFO), allowing the original encoded speech data to be carried in a 64 kbit/s channel. TFO offers benefits because transcoding can lead to a degradation of speech quality and requires computational resources. Brief Explanation For an MS-to-MS call, the transmission path covers the radio access network (RAN) as well as the core network (CN). Since the transmission modes and coding standards are different for RAN and CN, speech data is converted/transcoded at the transition points from RAN to CN. This conversion is performed in the TRAU network element which connects RAN and CN. 16 kbit/s for FR (Full Rate), Redundancy (Channel Coding)= 9.8 kbit/s => Gross data rate after adding redundancy = 22.8 kbit/s = 12.2 kbit/s for EFR (Enhanced Full Rate), Redundancy (Channel Coding)= 10.6 kbit/s => Gross data rate after adding redundancy = 22.8 kbit/s (same as FR) TRAU changes the bit rate of 16kbit/s of the BSS side to 64kbit/s of NSS side. = 5.6 kbit/s for HR (Half Rate), Redundancy (Channel Coding)= 5.8 kbit/s => Gross data rate after adding redundancy = 11.4 kbit/s See also * Full Rate * Half Rate * Enhanced Full Rate * Adaptive Multi-Rate TRAU was also the term used for the frame format used in transport of the compressed bits from these speech coders.

He is currently a member of the PMDB party and a Senator for Par√°. He is the father of H√©lder Barbalho, mayor of Ananindeua, Par√°, and the former husband of Federal Deputy Elcione Barbalho. Barbalho is a national figure, known throughout Brazil, albeit a controversial one. There have been raised numerous allegations of corruption and mismanagement of public funds against Barbalho, who owns newspaper Di√°rio do Par√° and is part owner of a local TV station (TV Tapaj√≥s) of the leading Globo Television network. Starting a political career in Bel√©m with humble possessions, Barbalho became a millionaire after decades in public office.O senador de 30 milh√µes He has held the offices of Federal Deputy over four terms, State Governor twice, Senator thrice and Minister twice. In 2000, Barbalho was the President of the PMDB party and Senator when a wave of corruption allegations against him took national headlines, involving embezzlement of public funds at the Superintend√™ncia de Desenvolvimento da Amaz√¥nia (SUDAM - Superintendence for Amazon's Development) development agency and the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA - National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform). Barbalho was forced to resign the office, later briefly arrested, and the SUDAM was closed. However, he was subsequently elected Federal Deputy in 2002 and 2006 and Senator in 2010. Biography Youth and education Jader (as he now spells his first name), was born in Bel√©m, capital of Par√°. Jader's parents are La√©rcio Wilson Barbalho (father) and Joanelle Fontenelle Barbalho (mother). Jader studied Law at the Federal University of Par√° (Universidade Federal do Par√°), graduating in 1971, and he became a student leader during Brazil's repressive military dictatorship that was installed after the military coup of 1964. Public offices held *Bel√©m city alderman (Vereador) from 1967 to 1971 *Par√° state deputy (Deputado Estadual) from 1971 to 1975 *Federal deputy of Par√° (Deputado Federal) from 1975 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010 *Par√° state governor (Governador do Par√°) from 1983 to 1987 and from 1991 to 1994 *Senator of Par√° (Senador) from 1995 to 2001 and actually from 2011 on He was also the federal minister of agrarian development and reform and of social welfare (1988‚Äì1990). Scandals In the 1990s, Jader was involved in several corruption scandals and risked impeachment. Facing the threat of impeachment in connection with fraud and corruption scandals, he resigned from the Senate in October 2001. Barbalho was implicated in a funding scandal at the regional development agency the Superintendency for Development of the Amazon (SUDAM) where over 2 billion dollars went missing. He is alleged to have used his power base in the Amazonian state of Para to influence which projects were approved by SUDAM. SUDAM was closed down in 2001 by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso because of the corruption allegations.BBC News, 17 February 2002, \\"Probe of Top Brazil Politician Continues\\" On February 22, 2002, Senator Ant√¥nio Carlos Magalh√£es gave an interview to state prosecutors in which he hinted at corruption involving Cardoso, Barbalho, the PMDB, the PFL, and the Supreme Court. The interview, which was leaked to the press, prompted Cardoso to begin sacking government appointments linked to Magalh√£es, most notably cabinet ministers Rodolpho Tourinho (mines and energy) and Waldeck Ornelas (social security) on February 23. In 2002, with public opinion favouring investigation into allegations of government corruption, the opposition sought the votes of 27 Senators and 171 Federal Deputies in Congress necessary to constitute a joint working committee (CPI) against Barbalho. On May 8, 2002, after the opposition had apparently secured these votes, Barbalho canceled a joint session of Congress and thereby prevented the opposition from bringing the issue to the floor. Afterward, political maneuverings persuaded enough legislators to change their minds, and the CPI threat was ended. On May 16 Saturnino Braga, the rapporteur of the Senate Ethics Committee, concluded that Magalh√£es and the government leader in the Senate, Jos√© Roberto Arruda of the Federal District, were guilty of having violated secrecy rules in the June 2000 vote that expelled Federal District Sen. Luis Estev√£o from Congress. After damaging testimony from the director of the Senate data-processing system, who stated that she broke into the voting system under orders from Magalh√£es and Arruda, the Senate Ethics Committee recommended the impeachment of Magalh√£es and Arruda for having broken Senate decorum. Rather than risk impeachment and a loss of political rights for eight years, Arruda resigned on May 24; Magalh√£es followed suit on May 30. With Arruda and Magalh√£es out of office, Congress, at risk of becoming ineffectual, continued to be mired in scandal as more allegations of past corruption involving Barbalho surfaced. A growing number of investigations into fraud in the state Bank of Par√°, SUDAM, and the National Land Reform Institute revealed the involvement of Barbalho when he was governor of Par√° and minister of land reform. Barbalho took a leave of absence from his post as senate president on July 20. In the face of mounting evidence and the likelihood of impeachment, he resigned from the Senate on October 4, following the same path of Magalh√£es and Arruda.

In Croatian sources, he is usually referred as ' 'senior' or ' 'dentist' to be distinguished from the more notable Croatian fascist leader and politician Ante Paveliƒá, who was twenty years younger and member of a different Party of Rights. Starting in 1906 he was a member of the Croatian parliament (Sabor) from the Party of Rights. The Party of Rights that Paveliƒá belonged to was known as Milinovci, after their leader Mile Starƒçeviƒá. On October 5, 1918, Paveliƒá presided over the initial session of the National Assembly of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On October 19, he became the vice president of the National Assembly. Paveliƒá authored the Croatian Parliament's declaration of October 29, 1918, that formally acknowledged the National Assembly as the superior authority over Croatia. Paveliƒá and others started negotiating with the Serbian envoy to the National Assembly Du≈°an T. Simoviƒá as soon as Hungary signed a truce with the Allies on October 13, 1918. Simoviƒá had said that their military victory and the treaty with Hungary gave them right to most of the territory of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, whereas Paveliƒá said that they want unification with Serbia, but that they needed a federal state as well as a delineation of Croatian and Serbian population that would assume a population transfer. Simoviƒá rejected the talk of federalization and Paveliƒá yielded, and there was no further discussion on either issue. As a delegate of the Assembly, he read the statement on uniting the SHS state with the Kingdom of Serbia into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes on December 1, 1918. Later, Paveliƒá joined the Democratic Party, and in 1932 he became the Speaker of the Senate of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

The Electrician billed itself in the early 1860s as \\"a weekly journal of Telegraphy, Electricity, and Applied Chemistry\\" and was published by Thomas Piper. the new Electrician that appeared in the late 1870s had a somewhat different focus and was published by James Gray on behalf of the proprietors, John Pender and James Anderson of the Eastern Telegraph Company, the biggest cable firm of the day. It described itself as \\"a weekly illustrated journal of electrical engineering, industry and science\\" and also featured more theoretical aspects of electrical engineering such as electromagnetism. In the late nineteenth century, The Electrician Printing and Publication Company Limited was established and began publishing shorter electrical engineering texts including well-known early electrical engineering titles such as Oliver Heaviside's Electromagnetic Theory (1893-1912), Oliver Lodge's The Work of Hertz and Some of His Successors (1894), and many others. Some of these publications were based on papers presented elsewhere and published in full in The Electrician. The new series of The Electrician quickly established itself in the field of electrical engineering and was regularly quoted and cited in Nature and elsewhere.

Steel, wood, wrought iron, and a few other metals are the most common types of materials used for pot racks. Pot racks also usually have some type of finish or stain to help them match pots and decor. In addition, pot racks can range in size from less than a foot to over fifteen feet long. These larger pot racks are capable of supporting dozens of pots and pans. Benefits Pot racks are often purchased for convenience, saving storage space, and for decorative value. Using a pot rack delivers convenience because a person is able to find the pots and pans quickly and easily when they are needed. Pot racks also save storage space by freeing up cabinet space and allowing pot racks to be stored on in previously unused space in the kitchen. Pot racks also provide decorative value and can enhance the overall scheme and visual appearance of the kitchen.Glenn Charles (2008) Pot Rack Introduction online at Potrackdesign.com (accessed on October 27, 2008) Types There are three basic categories of pot racks: hanging, wall mounted, and free standing. Hanging Hanging pot racks are the most common type of pot racks. Hanging pot racks need to be installed into ceiling joists. They usually come with chains or extension hooks, or hanging links and ceiling screws. Hanging pot racks are normally sold with hooks that can be positioned on the rim or on the grid. Pots and pans can be hung directly from the grid or from the rim using these hooks. Grids can be many shapes, but the most common are rectangular, round, or oval. Wall mounted Wall mounted pot racks are designed to hang on the wall to save space. Wall pot racks can appear like a horizontal bar or can look like a small hanging shelf. Bar pot racks are just a strip of metal that attaches to wall studs in two places. Pots are hung on the knob that protrude from the bar. Wall pot racks are safely attached to screws that are drilled into wall studs, not plaster or drywall. Free standing Free standing pot racks are not attached to anything else, but instead sit directly on the ground. There are many different looks and styles for free standing pot racks. Some look like tall book shelves and have pots resting on the wood at various levels. Others stand freely, but contain hooks to hang the pot on. Most freestanding pot racks have the same design elements as other decorative furniture pieces. Installation Hanging pot racks come in various heights. There are three measurements needed in order to install a hanging pot rack. First is the reaching height, or the height where it is comfortable for a person to reach. Most people want to hang a pot rack at a comfortable reaching height. This height is usually about one foot above the height of a person's head and this is where the pots should be located. The second measurement needed is the height of the ceiling. The third measurement is the height of the pot rack with the hooks. The height of the ceiling minus the reaching height is the required height of the pot rack and chains. Wall pot racks are safely attached to screws that are drilled into wall studs, not plaster or drywall. Otherwise, the weight of the pots and pans may dislodge the pot rack, damage your wall, or become a safety hazard.

The stadium is the larger of two stadiums owned and managed by the Atlanta Public Schools system. The other stadium is Grady Stadium. In October 2006, Lakewood received an Honorable Mention in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution as one of the top 10 high school stadiums in the state of Georgia. As chosen by the voters of Atlanta, Lakewood was picked as the 4th best stadium for high school football in the Atlanta metro area. As the largest stadium in the Atlanta Public Schools system, it essentially has been the home field for several future NFL players, including Jamal Lewis and Ahmad Carroll (Douglass), Lawrence Smith (Washington), Kelly Campbell (Mays), David Rocker, Tracy Rocker, and Corey Barlow (Fulton), Greg Favors (Southside), Kelvin Pritchett (Therrell) and Super Bowl XX MVP Richard Dent (Murphy). History Lakewood Stadium was the first high school stadium in the state of Georgia to have artificial turf. Lakewood Stadium was the site of the 1975 GHSA Class AAA Football Championship Game between Douglass High School and Central High School (Macon). Central (Macon) defeated home team Douglass 21 to 14. Lakewood Stadium has been used in commercial shoots and currently for the BET TV show The Game. This stadium is featured in the 2009 horror-comedy film Zombieland.

There are currently ~170 viruses recognised in this genus. These have been assembled into 88 species and 20 serogroups. The name Orthobunyavirus derives from Bunyamwera, Uganda, where the original type species Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus was first discovered, along with the prefix () meaning 'straight.' The type species is Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus. Epidemiology The genus is most diverse in Africa, Australia and Oceania, but occurs almost worldwide. Most orthobunyavirus species are transmitted by gnats and cause diseases of cattle. The California encephalitis virus, the La Crosse virus and the Jamestown Canyon virus are North American species that cause encephalitis in humans. Virology Bunyamwera virus of the genus Orthosbunyavirus *The type species is Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus. *The virus is spherical, diameter 80 nm to 120 nm, and comprises three negative-sense single stranded RNA molecules encapsulated in a ribonucleocapsid. *The three RNAs are described as S, M and L (for Small, Medium and Large) and are circa 1kb (kilobases), 4.5kb and 6.9kb in length *The S RNA encodes the Nucleocapsid protein (N protein) and a non structural protein (NS Protein).Genbank: Bunyamwera virus segment S, complete sequence *The M RNA encodes a polyprotein which is cleaved by host protease into Gn, NSm and Gc proteins. *The L RNA encodes the viral RNA dependent RNA Polymerase or L ProteinGenbank: Bunyamwera virus L segment, complete sequence Life cycle  Vectors  The primary vectors of Orthobunyaviruses are hematophagous insects of the Culicidae family, including members from a number of mosquito genera (including Aedes, Coquillettidia, Culex, Culiseta, and Anopheles) and biting midges (such as Culicoides paraensis). Although transmission by ticks and bed bugs may also occur. Viral vector preference is generally strict, with only a one or very small number of vectors transmitting a specific virus in the region, even where multiple viruses and vectors overlap. Organisms related to the preferential vector may be able to carry a virus but not competently transmit it. The vector arthropod acquires the virus while taking a blood meal from an infected host. In mosquitoes, replication of orthobunyaviruses is enhanced by immune modulation that occurs as a result of blood protein digestion producing GABA and the activation of GABAergic signalling. Infection is transmitted to a new host via viral particles in vector saliva. Orthobunyavirus infection in arthropod cells is not fully understood, but is generally non-cytopathological and deleterious effects are minimal. Infected mosquitoes may experience an increase in fitness. Transorvarial transmission has been observed among mosquitoes infected with orthobunyaviruses of the California serogroup Like mosquitoes, only female culicoid midges feed on blood; they prefer indoor feeding particularly during rain.  Sylvatic Cycle Hosts  In the slyvatic cycle, viruses are transmitted between mammalian hosts by the arthropod vector. A diverse range of mammals have been identified or implicated as hosts or reservoirs of orthobunyaviruses including: non-human primates, sloths, wild and domestic birds, marmosets, rodents, and large mammals such as deer, moose, and elk.  Infection  Infection begins with the bite of an infected competent vector organism. Viral entry proceeds by receptor-mediated (clathrin-dependent) endocytosis, but which receptors unknown. Although, Heparan sulfate and DC-SIGN (CD209 or Dendritic cell-specific intracellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) have been identified as viral entry components in some orthobunyaviruses. Gn/Gc heterodimers on the viral surface are responsible for target cell recognition, with Gc is considered the primary attachment protein, although Gn has been suggested as the attachment protein for LACV in arthropod cells. Acidification of the endosome triggers a conformational change in the Gc fusion peptide, uncoating the ribonuclearprotein (RNP) as it is released into the cytoplasm. Upon release into the cytoplasm, primary transcription begins with an endonuclease domain on L protein engaging in a process known as \\"cap-snatching.\\" During cap- snatching, 10-18 nucleotides of 5' 7-methylguanylate primers are cleaved from host mRNAs and attached to prime the 5' end of the viral RNAs. Like all negative-sense RNA viruses, orthobunyaviruses require ongoing, concurrent translation by the host cell to produce full-length viral mRNAs, consequently the 3' end of orthobunyavirus mRNAs lack polyadenylation. Notably they are also missing the signal for polyadenylation; instead the 3' ends are thought to form a stem-loop structure. Antigenomes (full length positive-sense RNAs) used as templates for replication of the viral genome are produced by L protein RdRp without the need for primers. Both negative-sense genomes and positive-sense antigenomes are associated with N proteins (forming RNPs) at all times during the replication cycle. Thus, N and L are the minimum proteins required for transcription and replication The M genome segment codes for the Gn-NSm-Gc polyprotein on a single open-reading frame (ORF) which is cotranslationally cleaved by internal signal peptides and host signal peptidase. The free glycoproteins Gc and Gn insert into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and form heterodimers. A Golgi retention signal on Gn, permits transport of the heterodimers to the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation occurs. The presence of the viral glycoproteins modifies the Golgi membrane to enable budding of RNPs into a Golgi derived tubular viral factory (viroplasm). As segmented viruses, orthobuynaviruses require precise packaging of one of each of the three genomic segments into the final virion to produce a mature, infectious particle. Packaging appears to be directed by signals contained entirely within UTR sequences. The packaged genomes acquire a lipid membrane as they bud into the viral factories, are then transported to the host cell plasma membrane and released via exocytosis. A final gylcoprotein modification upon release produces a mature, infectious particle.  Evolution  Orthobunyaviruses evolve partly by a key mechanism known as genomic reassortment, which also occurs in other segmented viruses. When viruses of the same group co-infect a host cell, mixtures and novel combinations of the S, M, and L segments can be produced, increasing diversity. The most common reassortment events are with the L and S segments. Serogroups The taxonomy remains somewhat fluid as relatively few viral genomes in this genus have been sequenced. Several of the viruses listed have been shown to be recombinants of other viruses and may be reclassified. 18 serogroups have been recognized on the basis of the results of cross- hemagglutination inhibition and antibody neutralization relationships. Another - Wyeomyia - has since been recognised. Several viruses have not yet been classified into one of the serogroups. The Simbu serogroup is the largest and contains at least 25 members. There are at least 13 members in the Group C serogroup. Medically important viruses belong to the Bwamba, Bunyamwera, California, Group C and Simbu serogroups.

This microorganism is the causative agent of the well known trench fever. This bacterium caused outbreaks of trench fever affecting 1 million soldiers in Europe during World War I. Genome B. quintana had an estimated genome size of 1,700 to 2,174 kb., but the first genome sequence (of strain RM-11) contains a single circular chromosome of 1,587,646 bp. Background and characteristics B. quintana is a fastidious, aerobic, Gram-negative(-), pole rod-shaped (bacillus) bacterium. The infection caused by this microorganism, trench fever, was first documented in soldiers during World War I, but has now been seen Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its primary vector is known to be Pediculus humanus variety corporis, also known as the human body louse. It was first known to be isolated in axenic culture by J.W. Vinson in 1960, from a patient in Mexico City. He then followed Koch's postulates, infecting volunteers with the bacterium, showing consistent symptoms and clinical manifestations of trench fever. The medium best for growing this bacterium is blood-enriched in an atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. Pathophysiology Although lice are animal vectors, humans (and some other primates) are the only known animal reservoir hosts for this bacterium in vivo. It infects endothelial cells and can infect erythrocytes by binding and entering with a large vacuole. Once inside, they begin to proliferate and cause nuclear atypia (intraerythrocytic B.quintana colonization). This leads to apoptosis being suppressed, proinflammatory cytokines are released, and vascular proliferation increases. All of these processes result in patients possessing systemic symptoms (chills, fever, diaphoresis), bacteremia, and lymphatic enlargement. A major role in B. quintana infection is its lipopolysaccharide covering which is an antagonist of the toll-like receptor 4. The reason this infection might persist is because this organism also results in monocytes overproducing interleukin-10 (IL-10), thus weakening the immune response. B. quintana also induces lesions seen in bacillary angiomatosis that protrude into vascular lumina, often occluding blood flow. The enhanced growth of these cells is believed to be due to the secretion of angiogenic factors, thus inducing neovascularization. Release of an icosahedral particle, 40 nm in length, has been detected in cultures of B. quintana's close relative, B. henselae. This particle contains a 14-kb linear DNA segment, but its function in Bartonella pathophysiology is still unknown. In trench fever or B. quintana-induced endocarditis patients, bacillary angiomatosis lesions are also seen. Notably, endocarditis is a new manifestation of the infection, not seen in World War I troops. Ecology and epidemiology B. quintana infection has subsequently been seen in every continent except Antarctica. Local infections have been associated with risk factors such as poverty, alcoholism, and homelessness. Serological evidence of B. quintana infection showed, of hospitalized homeless patients, 16% were infected, as opposed to 1.8% of nonhospitalized homeless persons, and 0% of blood donors at large. Lice have been demonstrated, as of recently, to be the key component in transmitting B. quintana. This has been attributed to living in unsanitary conditions and crowded areas, where the risk of coming into contact with other individuals carrying B. quintana and ectoparasites (body lice) is increased. Also noteworthy, the increasing migration worldwide may also play a role in spreading trench fever, from areas where it is endemic to susceptible populations in urban areas. Recent concern is the possibility of the emergence of new strains of B. quintana through horizontal gene transfer, which could result in the acquisition of other virulence factors. Clinical manifestations Mycobacterium avium complex coinfecting an AIDS patient The clinical manifestations of B. quintana infection are highly variable. The incubation period is now known to be 5‚Äì20 days; it was originally thought to be 3‚Äì38 days. The infection can start as an acute onset of a febrile episode, relapsing febrile episodes, or as a persistent typhoidal illness; commonly seen are maculopapular rashes, conjunctivitis, headache, and myalgias, with splenomegaly being less common. Most patients present with pain in the lower legs (shins), sore muscles of the legs and back, and hyperaesthesia of the shins. Rarely is B. quintana infection fatal, unless endocarditis develops and goes untreated. Weight loss, and thrombocytopenia are sometimes also seen. Recovery can take up to a month. Diagnosis and treatment To have a definite diagnosis of infection with B. quintana requires either serological cultures or nucleic acid amplification techniques. To differentiate between different species, immunofluorescence assays that use mouse antisera are used, as well as DNA hybridization and restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or citrate synthase gene sequencing. Treatment usually consists of a 4- to 6-week course of doxycycline, erythromycin, or azithromycin.

In computational geometry, numerous algorithms are proposed for computing the convex hull of a finite set of points, with various computational complexities. Computing the convex hull means that a non-ambiguous and efficient representation of the required convex shape is constructed. The complexity of the corresponding algorithms is usually estimated in terms of n, the number of input points, and sometimes also in terms of h, the number of points on the convex hull.  Planar case  Consider the general case when the input to the algorithm is a finite unordered set of points on a Cartesian plane. An important special case, in which the points are given in the order of traversal of a simple polygon's boundary, is described later in a separate subsection. If not all points are on the same line, then their convex hull is a convex polygon whose vertices are some of the points in the input set. Its most common representation is the list of its vertices ordered along its boundary clockwise or counterclockwise. In some applications it is convenient to represent a convex polygon as an intersection of a set of half-planes. Lower bound on computational complexity For a finite set of points in the plane the lower bound on the computational complexity of finding the convex hull represented as a convex polygon is easily shown to be the same as for sorting using the following reduction. For the set x_1,\\\\dots,x_n numbers to sort consider the set of points (x_1, x^2_1),\\\\dots,(x_n, x^2_n) of points in the plane. Since they lie on a parabola, which is a convex curve it is easy to see that the vertices of the convex hull, when traversed along the boundary, produce the sorted order of the numbers x_1,\\\\dots,x_n. Clearly, linear time is required for the described transformation of numbers into points and then extracting their sorted order. Therefore, in the general case the convex hull of n points cannot be computed more quickly than sorting. The standard Œ©(n log n) lower bound for sorting is proven in the decision tree model of computing, in which only numerical comparisons but not arithmetic operations can be performed; however, in this model, convex hulls cannot be computed at all. Sorting also requires Œ©(n log n) time in the algebraic decision tree model of computation, a model that is more suitable for convex hulls, and in this model convex hulls also require Œ©(n log n) time.Preparata, Shamos, Computational Geometry, Chapter \\"Convex Hulls: Basic Algorithms\\" However, in models of computer arithmetic that allow numbers to be sorted more quickly than O(n log n) time, for instance by using integer sorting algorithms, planar convex hulls can also be computed more quickly: the Graham scan algorithm for convex hulls consists of a single sorting step followed by a linear amount of additional work.  Optimal output-sensitive algorithms  As stated above, the complexity of finding a convex hull as a function of the input size n is lower bounded by Œ©(n log n). However, the complexity of some convex hull algorithms can be characterized in terms of both input size n and the output size h (the number of points in the hull). Such algorithms are called output-sensitive algorithms. They may be asymptotically more efficient than Œò(n log n) algorithms in cases when h = o(n). The lower bound on worst- case running time of output-sensitive convex hull algorithms was established to be Œ©(n log h) in the planar case. There are several algorithms which attain this optimal time complexity. The earliest one was introduced by Kirkpatrick and Seidel in 1986 (who called it \\"the ultimate convex hull algorithm\\"). A much simpler algorithm was developed by Chan in 1996, and is called Chan's algorithm.  Algorithms  Known convex hull algorithms are listed below, ordered by the date of first publication. Time complexity of each algorithm is stated in terms of the number of inputs points n and the number of points on the hull h. Note that in the worst case h may be as large as n. * Gift wrapping, a.k.a. Jarvis march ‚Äî O(nh) One of the simplest (although not the most time efficient in the worst case) planar algorithms. Created independently by Chand & Kapur in 1970 and R. A. Jarvis in 1973. It has O(nh) time complexity, where n is the number of points in the set, and h is the number of points in the hull. In the worst case the complexity is Œò(n2). * Graham scan ‚Äî O(n log n) A slightly more sophisticated, but much more efficient algorithm, published by Ronald Graham in 1972. If the points are already sorted by one of the coordinates or by the angle to a fixed vector, then the algorithm takes O(n) time. * Quickhull Created independently in 1977 by W. Eddy and in 1978 by A. Bykat. Just like the quicksort algorithm, it has the expected time complexity of O(n log n), but may degenerate to O(n2) in the worst case. * Divide and conquer ‚Äî O(n log n) Another O(n log n) algorithm, published in 1977 by Preparata and Hong. This algorithm is also applicable to the three dimensional case. * Monotone chain, a.k.a. Andrew's algorithm‚Äî O(n log n) Published in 1979 by A. M. Andrew. The algorithm can be seen as a variant of Graham scan which sorts the points lexicographically by their coordinates. When the input is already sorted, the algorithm takes O(n) time. * Incremental convex hull algorithm ‚Äî O(n log n) Published in 1984 by Michael Kallay. * Kirkpatrick‚ÄìSeidel algorithm ‚Äî O(n log h) The first optimal output-sensitive algorithm. It modifies the divide and conquer algorithm by using the technique of marriage-before-conquest and low- dimensional linear programming. Published by Kirkpatrick and Seidel in 1986. * Chan's algorithm ‚Äî O(n log h) A simpler optimal output-sensitive algorithm created by Chan in 1996. It combines gift wrapping with the execution of an O(n log n) algorithm (such as Graham scan) on small subsets of the input.  Akl‚ÄìToussaint heuristic  The following simple heuristic is often used as the first step in implementations of convex hull algorithms to improve their performance. It is based on the efficient convex hull algorithm by Selim Akl and G. T. Toussaint, 1978. The idea is to quickly exclude many points that would not be part of the convex hull anyway. This method is based on the following idea. Find the two points with the lowest and highest x-coordinates, and the two points with the lowest and highest y-coordinates. (Each of these operations takes O(n).) These four points form a convex quadrilateral, and all points that lie in this quadrilateral (except for the four initially chosen vertices) are not part of the convex hull. Finding all of these points that lie in this quadrilateral is also O(n), and thus, the entire operation is O(n). Optionally, the points with smallest and largest sums of x- and y-coordinates as well as those with smallest and largest differences of x- and y-coordinates can also be added to the quadrilateral, thus forming an irregular convex octagon, whose insides can be safely discarded. If the points are random variables, then for a narrow but commonly encountered class of probability density functions, this throw-away pre-processing step will make a convex hull algorithm run in linear expected time, even if the worst-case complexity of the convex hull algorithm is quadratic in n.Luc Devroye and Godfried Toussaint, \\"A note on linear expected time algorithms for finding convex hulls,\\" Computing, Vol. 26, 1981, pp. 361-366. On-line and dynamic convex hull problems The discussion above considers the case when all input points are known in advance. One may consider two other settings. * Online convex hull problem: Input points are obtained sequentially one by one. After each point arrives on input, the convex hull for the pointset obtained so far must be efficiently computed. * Dynamic convex hull maintenance: The input points may be sequentially inserted or deleted, and the convex hull must be updated after each insert/delete operation. Insertion of a point may increase the number of vertices of a convex hull at most by 1, while deletion may convert an n-vertex convex hull into an n-1-vertex one. The online version may be handled with O(log n) per point, which is asymptotically optimal. The dynamic version may be handled with O(log2 n) per operation.  Simple polygon  The convex hull of a simple polygon is divided by the polygon into pieces, one of which is the polygon itself and the rest are pockets bounded by a piece of the polygon boundary and a single hull edge. Although many algorithms have been published for the problem of constructing the convex hull of a simple polygon, nearly half of them are incorrect. McCallum and Avis provided the first correct algorithm. A later simplification by and uses only a single stack data structure. Their algorithm traverses the polygon clockwise, starting from its leftmost vertex. As it does, it stores a convex sequence of vertices on the stack, the ones that have not yet been identified as being within pockets. At each step, the algorithm follows a path along the polygon from the stack top to the next vertex that is not in one of the two pockets adjacent to the stack top. Then, while the top two vertices on the stack together with this new vertex are not in convex position, it pops the stack, before finally pushing the new vertex onto the stack. When the clockwise traversal reaches the starting point, the algorithm returns the sequence of stack vertices as the hull.  Higher dimensions  A number of algorithms are known for the three- dimensional case, as well as for arbitrary dimensions.See David Mount's Lecture Notes, including Lecture 4 for recent developments, including Chan's algorithm. Chan's algorithm is used for dimensions 2 and 3, and Quickhull is used for computation of the convex hull in higher dimensions. For a finite set of points, the convex hull is a convex polyhedron in three dimensions, or in general a convex polytope for any number of dimensions, whose vertices are some of the points in the input set. Its representation is not so simple as in the planar case, however. In higher dimensions, even if the vertices of a convex polytope are known, construction of its faces is a non-trivial task, as is the dual problem of constructing the vertices given the faces. The size of the output face information may be exponentially larger than the size of the input vertices, and even in cases where the input and output are both of comparable size the known algorithms for high-dimensional convex hulls are not output-sensitive due both to issues with degenerate inputs and with intermediate results of high complexity..

Advocate magazine noted that along with other openly gay YouTube celebrities, Sledd's rising fame also brought a lot of anti-gay commenters, which it ascribed to John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory. It regards the online disinhibition effect, in which Internet users exhibit unsociable tendencies while interacting with other Internet users. Krahulik and Holkins suggest that, given both anonymity and an audience, an otherwise regular person becomes aggressively antisocial. In 2013, Holkins gave the corollary that \\"Normal Person ‚Äì Consequences + Audience = Total Fuckwad\\".

In February 2008, the channels were among the most popular on YouTube when \\"What The Buck?!\\" was 6th, Crocker's channel 8th, Sledd 13th and \\"Gay God\\" in 25th.

He is most notable as Motherwell's first and longest-serving manager, who guided the team to their only Scottish league title in the 1931‚Äì32 season. Playing career Hunter was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, and at the age of 18 he signed for Abercorn, who had been relegated to Division Two the previous season. While Abercorn did not improve any during his time there ‚Äì in his final season they finished bottom of the Second Division and thus bottom of the League, Hunter was duly signed by Liverpool. He was part of the Liverpool side that won their first ever English league championship in 1900‚Äì01. A year later he moved back to Scotland, signing for Hearts for ¬£300 in a joint transfer with Tom Robertson. He was part of the Hearts side that lost the 1903 Scottish Cup Final to Rangers. In 1904 he joined Woolwich Arsenal in a ¬£165 transfer, playing 22 times for them in 1904‚Äì05 before joining Portsmouth of the Southern League. It was when he joined Dundee in 1907, that he became a prolific goalscorer and earned his only cap for Scotland in a 3‚Äì2 defeat by Wales at Wrexham. In the 1910 Scottish Cup Final Dundee were up against a strong Clyde team who had knocked out the champions Celtic 3‚Äì1 in the semi-final, and were 2‚Äì0 up in the final with six minutes to play, when Hunter scored a goal to give Dundee hope. Two minutes later Dundee equalised. The first replay ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw but Dundee won the second replay 2‚Äì1, with Hunter scoring the winning goal. He signed for Clyde in September 1910, but injury forced him to retire six months later. Managerial career Two months later, in April 1911, Hunter was appointed secretary-manager at Motherwell at the age of 32. Motherwell had finished second bottom of Division One in the previous season, just above relegated Queens Park. Hunter would improve their position slightly in the following season, and the reserve side had won their League title. Motherwell improved steadily, although the First World War interrupted this progress. In 1916‚Äì17 Hunter gave a debut to young centre-forward Hughie Ferguson, who scored and followed it up with a hat-trick a week later against Dundee. Ferguson was Motherwell's top scorer in every season he played at Fir Park, and to this day he remains Motherwell's all-time top scorer. For the next four seasons Motherwell never finished lower than fifth in the league, but over time financial restraints began to tell on the club; local unemployment was higher than it had ever been and crowds were down, and the club had to abandon their reserve team. Motherwell began to slip in the league and they finished the 1924‚Äì25 third from bottom, on the same points total as the two teams immediately below them: only Ferguson's goals that kept them up. The following season started off pretty well for Motherwell but in October Hughie Ferguson was sold to Cardiff City. Hunter had a replacement for Ferguson in Willie MacFadyen, who would more than justify the managers faith in him. Motherwell finished fifth that season and for the next eight seasons they would not finish lower than third, with a League title in 1931‚Äì32. Hunter would remain as manager at Fir Park until 1946 when George Stevenson, inside left and playmaker of the team which won the Championship would take over. Sailor found it hard to leave Fir Park and remained as club secretary until his retirement in 1959 at the age of 80. The club granted him a weekly pension upon his retirement. He died in January 1966.

Founded as the Profile Theatre in 1974 as a touring theater company, in 1976 the company made Portland a permanent home and in 1982 it moved to its current home of 25A Forest Ave Portland, ME. Anita Stewart has served as the Artistic Director since 1996 and in 2006 was made Executive Director as well. History Portland Stage Company was founded in 1974 as the Profile Theatre, a touring company of young theater professionals, with the mission to \\"entertain, educate, and engage its audiences by producing a wide range of artistic works and programs that explore basic human issues and concerns relevant to the communities served by the theater.\\" The first Artistic Director, Ted Davis (1974-1976) initially led the company through performances in a wide variety of venues, but by 1976, Portland had become the company's permanent home. Davis was followed as Artistic Director by Michael Rafkin (1976-1977) and Frank Goodman (1977-1978), and in 1978, the company changed its name to Portland Stage Company. In the years that followed, under Artistic Director Charles Towers (1978-1981), Portland Stage earned a national reputation as a professional theater company, becoming a member of LORT (the League of Resident Theatres) and TCG (Theatre Communications Group) and signing a letter of agreement with Actors' Equity Association. In 1982, under the leadership of Barbara Rosoff (1981-1987) Portland Stage moved to its current home, a former Oddfellows Hall at 25A Forest Avenue in Portland, which at the time had been newly renovated as the Portland Performing Arts Center. Since the 1980s, Portland Stage has been committed to offering student matinees of every show in its mainstage season. Today, over 4,000 students from Maine and New Hampshire attend these performances each year, many of them getting their first exposure to professional theater at Portland Stage. Under Artistic Director Richard Hamburger (1986-1992), the company launched the Little Festival of the Unexpected in 1990, a week-long annual festival that brings playwrights from around the country to develop new plays at Portland Stage. Recently celebrating its 23rd year, the Little Festival has helped writers such as Mac Wellman, Nicky Silver, Douglas Carter Beane, Nilo Cruz, Quiara Alegria Hudes, and John Cariani land productions both on Portland Stage's Mainstage and in regional theaters around the country. Hamburger was followed as Artistic Director by Greg Leaming (1992-1996), and then in 1996 by the team of Christopher Akerlind and Anita Stewart. Akerlind, a lighting designer, and Stewart, a set designer, were at the time the only designers to head a regional theater in the United States. Under their leadership, Portland Stage began a holiday tradition of producing Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol each December. Akerlind and Stewart also continued the theater's commitment to new work, launching the From Away festival in 1996, an annual collaboration with the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa that brings authors from around the world to Portland each fall for staged readings of their work in translation. In 1998, Christopher Akerlind left Portland Stage Company and Anita Stewart (1998‚Äìpresent) became the sole Artistic Director. In 2000, Portland Stage purchased the Portland Performing Arts Center where it is located, a huge step towards long-term stability and a far cry from the company's itinerant roots in the mid-‚Äò70s. Since taking ownership of the building, Portland Stage has dramatically expanded its audience base, formed an Affiliate Artists group of local theater professionals, and launched a second season of productions, the Studio Series, which debuted in 2007. At the end of their 2011‚Äì12 season Portland Stage Company had produced 332 plays and counting, including 45 world premieres. Theater for Kids and Education Theater for Kids opened its doors in January 2010 in one of Portland Stage's storefront spaces as the new arm of Portland Stage outreach. Geared at children ages 4‚Äì10 Theater for Kids' main offering is 'Play me a Story' where Affiliate Artists, a group of theater professionals connected with the theater, read and act out popular children's stories followed by acting workshops. Affiliate Artists help bring 'Play Me A Story' on tour to local schools in the area as well as work as instructors for summer and school vacation camps. Portland Stage also seeks to educate the next generation of theater artists by hiring 10-11 interns every year. The interns are hired into different fields from production to administration and have intensive hands-on experience in each of their departments during a 7-show season. Interns from Portland Stage have gone on to work at Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Houston Grand Opera, Manhattan Theater Club, Cleveland Playhouse and more. New Work and The Clauder Competition Portland Stage has shown a commitment to new work. Since 1990 the Little Festival of the Unexpected has performed readings of 3-5 new plays to the public every year. Plays workshopped here will sometimes be moved to Portland Stage's mainstage in coming seasons. Since 1996, in partnership with the International Writer's Program at the University of Iowa, Portland Stage has presented 'From Away' every year to showcase work of international playwrights in translation. Additionally, Portland Stage adjudicates the Clauder Competition for New England Playwrights. The competition was started in 1981 and has been adjudicated by Portland Stage since 1999 Portland Stage has adjudicated the competition on a 3-year cycle. Past winners have been: (2000) Laura Harrington \\"Hallowed Ground\\", (2003) Quiara Alegria Hudes \\"Yemaya's Belly\\", (2006) William Donnelly \\"Magnetic North\\", and (2009) Gregory Hischak \\"The Center of Gravity\\".

Design and development During 1946, Bell Helicopter began development of a new utility helicopter, the Model 42, much larger than the Model 47, which utilized a scaled-up version of the Model 47's rotor system. Three prototypes were built, but serious rotor problems and complexity of mechanical systems precluded production. The initial Model 42 variant was civilian, but the United States Air Force ordered the development of its military variant, the Model 48. Two prototypes were ordered as the XR-12, powered by a single Pratt & Whitney R-1340-AN-1 radial engine and featuring seating for five. Of very similar construction to the Model 42, the Model 48 had a shorter rotor mast. A production batch of 34 helicopters was ordered, under the designation R-12A, but cancelled in 1947. Another enlarged prototype (the XR-12B, Model 48A) with seats for eight plus two pilots and a more powerful Pratt & Whitney R-1340-55 engine was also ordered, followed by ten pre-series YR-12B helicopters, with a glazed nose, instead of the car-like nose of the Model 42 and XR-12. While under flight test the helicopter was redesignated the H-12, but the results were not satisfactory, as there were major problems with the main rotor due to blade weaving and poor rotor governor performance.

It was renumbered No. 203 when the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918. History First World War The squadron can be traced to The Eastchurch Squadron, which formed Eastchurch in February 1914. After mobilisation at the start of WWI it was renamed No.3 Wing RNAS, and then later as No.3 (Naval) Squadron. In March 1915, the squadron, under the command of Commander Charles Samson, moved to the island of Tenedos, and began operating 18 aircraft in support of the Gallipoli Campaign. In the first weeks of the campaign they took over 700 photographs of the peninsula, and conducted other ground support tasks including spotting for naval gunfire, and reporting the movements of Ottoman troops. On 21 June 1915, the squadron became No. 3 Wing RNAS and was moved to Imbros. On 19 November, during a raid against a railway junction near the Maritsa River in Bulgaria, Squadron Commander Richard Bell Davies won the Victoria Cross for landing to rescue a pilot who had been shot down, in the face of intense enemy fire. The squadron returned to the UK at the end of 1915, and was disbanded. A new No. 3 Squadron was formed at Saint Pol on 5 November 1916 from elements of No. 1 Wing RNAS. It then served as a fighter squadron on the Western Front. Among the numerous types of aircraft it was equipped with were the Nieuport 17, Nieuport 21, and Sopwith Pup, followed later by the Sopwith Camel. Among its notable Officers Commanding were Canada's first ace, Redford Mulock; Lloyd S.

Second World War Shortly before the start of the war the squadron was re-equipped with Short Singapore IIIs and in 1940 with Bristol Blenheims. The squadron flew patrols over the Red Sea from Basra. At the end of 1941 the squadron operated Bristol Blenheim IV, Mediterranean from various bases in Western Egypt, flying patrols from the Libyan coast out as far as Crete. In 1942 the squadron re-equipped with Martin Baltimore aircraft and was involved in operations in Syria. In 1943 the squadron was posted to RAF Santacruzhttp://www.rafweb.org/Stations/Stations-S.htm India and was re- equipped with Vickers Wellingtons to fly coastal patrols. The squadron converted to Consolidated Liberator aircraft in November 1944 and began anti- shipping patrols over the Bay of Bengal.

In July 1954, the squadron was flying Neptune MR.2s from RAF Topcliffe, along with No.s No. 36 and No. 210 Squadrons as part of No. 19 Group, RAF Coastal Command. The squadron remained a Maritime Reconnaissance squadron for the remainder of its existence operating Avro Shackletons and then Hawker Siddeley Nimrods from RAF Luqa between July 1971 and December 1977. The squadron disbanded on 31 December 1977 at RAF Luqa in Malta, by which time it was part of No. 18 Group within RAF Strike Command. Sea Kings The squadron was reformed in October 1996, when the Sea King Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall was redesignated 203(R) Squadron as a reserve unit. In 2008, 203(R) Squadron relocated to RAF Valley in Anglesey, maintaining its role as the Sea King OCU and operating the Sea King HAR.3 until it was disbanded on 14 September 2014 following the withdrawal of the Sea King from RAF service.http://rafweb.org/Squadrons/Sqn201-205.htm References Citations Bibliography   External links  203 03 Squadron No. 203 Category:Military units and formations in Aden in World War II Category:Military units and formations in Mandatory Palestine in World War II R Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Maritime patrol aircraft units and formations Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 2014 ","title":"No. 203 Squadron RAF"},{"id":"11700584","text":"National Commission on Status of Women (NCSW) is a Pakistani statutory body established by the President Pervez Musharraf, under the XXVI Ordinance dated 17 July 2000.Mumtaz RashidiThe original National Commission was established during the regime of late Gen Zia ul Haq. This 16-member Pakistan National Commission on the Status of Women was set up on 9th of July 1983 via Government of Pakistan Gazette Notification and was headed by Begum Zari Sarfaraz and published the famous 'Report on the Status of Women in Pakistan' in 1985, making strong recommendations against the Hadood Islamic laws earlier promulgated by Gen Zia's regime. The members of the original Commission were: Begum Zari Sarfaraz, Chair; Begum Mahmooda Salim Khan, NWFP; Mrs DJ Kaikobad, Baluchistan; Begum Saeeda Qazi Isa, Baluchistan; Mrs. Mumtaz Rashidi, Sindh; Khanum Gohar Aijaz, Sindh; Prof. Amina Khamsani, Sindh; Begum Anwar G.

Hashmi, male member. Several federal secretaries were also ex-officio members. The main objective of the Commission is the emancipation of women, equalization of opportunities and socio-economic conditions amongst women and men and elimination of all sorts of discrimination amongst women. The main functions of the Commission include the examination of the policy, programmes and other measures taken by the government for women development and the review of all policies, laws, rules and regulations affecting the status and rights of women and gender equality in accordance with the Constitution. Some focuses of the committee include violence against women and the needs of rural working women. At the present time, Khawar Mumtaz is the Chairperson of NCSW. Mission The National Commission on the Status of Women was formed with the intention of examining policies, programs, and laws that affect women's development and gender equality. The commission strives to build and maintain relationships with NGO's and other experts in order to effectively protect women's rights. History In 2000, the official National Commission on the Status of Women was formed through a presidential ordinance. From 2000-2012 four commissions served out their terms and cycled through four different chairpersons. In 2013, the National Commission gained administrative and financial autonomy and so the fifth commission was formed. The commission is currently on its sixth commission and will renew in November 2019.

There are approximately 1,524 such peaks on Earth. Some well-known peaks, such as the Matterhorn and Eiger, are not Ultras because they are connected to higher mountains by high cols and therefore do not achieve enough topographic prominence. The term \\"Ultra\\" originated with earth scientist Steve Fry, from his studies of the prominence of peaks in Washington in the 1980s. His original term was \\"ultra major mountain\\", referring to peaks with at least of prominence. Distribution Currently, 1,515 Ultras have been identified above sea level: 637 in Asia, 353 in North America, 209 in South America, 119 in Europe (including the Caucasus), 84 in Africa, 69 in Australasia and 39 in Antarctica. Many of the world's largest mountains are Ultras, including Mount Everest, K2, Kilimanjaro, Mont Blanc, and Mount Olympus. On the other hand, others such as the Eiger and the Matterhorn are not Ultras because they do not have sufficient prominence. Many Ultras lie in rarely visited and inhospitable parts of the world, including 39 in Greenland, the high points of the Arctic islands of Novaya Zemlya, Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen, and many of the peaks of the Greater ranges of Asia. In British Columbia, some of the mountains listed do not even have generally recognized names. Thirteen of the fourteen 8,000-metre summits are Ultras (the exception being Lhotse), and there are a further 64 Ultras over in height. There are 90 Ultras with a prominence of over , but only 22 with more than prominence. A number of Ultras have yet to be climbed, with Sauyr Zhotasy, (possibly) Mount Siple, and Gangkar Puensum being the most likely candidates for the most prominent unclimbed mountain in the world. (See footnotes 3 and 10.) All of the Seven Summits are Ultras by virtue of the fact that they are the high points of large landmasses. Each has its key col at or near sea level, resulting in a prominence value almost equal to its elevation.

It is situated about two miles (3 km) east of Uley, five miles (8 km) east of Dursley and four miles (6 km) west of Tetbury. The landscape is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The hamlet of Newington Bagpath lies to the west of the village; the parish lands extend near to the small village of Owlpen. History From the medieval period in the 12th century until 1956, the manor with about , was the property of the Kingscote family, originally tenants of the Berkeley family of Berkeley Castle, whose principal residence was Kingscote Park. The manor is mentioned in the Domesday Book as 'Chingescote'. This, on the site of the old manor house, was demolished in the 1960s. The house today known as Kingscote Park was formerly known as Kingscote Cottage, the dower house where John Wedgwood (1766‚Äì1844), founder of the Royal Horticultural Society, lived in the 1820s. The parish is transected by a Roman road and a Roman settlement was excavated centred on a field named The Chessalls. The site covers 30 hectares and was occupied from the late 1st century AD through to its heyday in the 4th century. It may have been a small town or villa estate, with evidence of a series of strip buildings replaced in the 4th century by a house within a walled compound. The house seems to have been of high status, with mosaic floors, including a Venus mosaic now displayed in the nearby Corinium Museum, hypocausts and wall-plaster paintings. The Rev. Alan Gardner Cornwall was rector of the adjoining ecclesiastical parish of Bagpath with Owlpen from 1827 to 1842. His memoirs were published shortly after his death and are available online in .pdf format. They are a lively account of his early life with the Clapham Sect in London, his friendship with the Kingscote family, whose daughter Caroline he married, and of his ministry at a time of social distress following the decline of the local woollen cloth industry in the 1830s.

It is written by creator Joss Whedon. It is dedicated to the late Janie Kleinman, a network executive whom Whedon worked with and admired. Plot \\"The Chain\\" focuses on one of the Slayers used by Buffy Summers as a decoy to fool her enemies. The comic is a standalone issue, and features no appearances from Buffy herself, although season seven characters Andrew Wells, Rupert Giles, Vi, and Rona play small roles. The story is told through parallel narratives, showing the Slayer's calling, assignment as a Buffy decoy, and death. The story itself is largely narrated by the Buffy decoy. An unnamed Potential Slayer, she is activated during the events of \\"Chosen\\". She is violently thrown on her back by the calling but then saves the lives of her schoolmates with her newfound powers. After seeing a commercial on local television starring Andrew and Vi, the girl finds the Slayer organization and \\"the chain\\" to which all Slayers are connected. While fighting vampires with a squad of Slayers, the narrator intervenes to save a fellow Slayer and is bitten by a vampire. Squad leader Rona identifies the Slayer as a candidate to serve as a Buffy decoy in an underground society of demons, monsters, and faeries. The girl is ultimately killed by the demon she was sent to deter, Yamanh, who is proud to have slain Buffy Summers. Following her demise, other Slayers drop in to dispose of Yamanh and his followers, who are engaged in battle with the underground clans of faeries, slugs, raven-like demons, and a \\"leafblower\\" type looking mystical creature that the decoy had united against Yamanh. The narrator's final thoughts suggest she is happy to have saved the world and been part of \\"the chain\\", even if her own name will never be known. Production Editor Scott Allie describes \\"The Chain\\" as an important story: \\"Joss put a lot into this one. If it were an episode of the show, he would have directed it.\\" Paul Lee penciled the issue, proceeding Georges Jeanty, who returns the following issue. In one panel, Lee depicted past Slayers such as the First Slayer, the Righteous Slayer, Naay√©√©'neizgh√°ni the Navajo Slayer, Nikki Wood, Elizabeth \\"Edward\\" Weston, Anni Sonnenblume, and the Chinese Slayer. In the same panel, season one villain The Master appears in the background along with a Turok-Han. Reception In a Harvard Independent review, \\"The Chain\\" received particular praise for \\"creating webs of complex and intellectually stimulating meaning\\" using the medium of comics.Buffy the TV Slayer, Harvard Independent. Doan, Truc. Canonical issues This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel\\" continuity.Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007). Timing *Intended to be set after Buffy's seventh season. The timing is uncertain. It is possibly set sometime after \\"The Long Way Home\\", part 1 as Buffy refers to her decoy as alive, although Rona intimates that her existence is somewhat secretive and therefore the fact that she is dead may not have ever reached Buffy.

The game has a soundtrack of instrumental songs composed by Seppo Hurme (who also goes by Fleshbrain).mirsoft.info: Seppo Hurme Most of the gameplay requires the player to solve a series of real-time puzzles in which he uses tools, such as a hammer or screwdriver, which the main character, Gubble (an alien), uses in a humorous way to remove the implements of these tools, such as nails and screws, from the playing area. The opening storyline to Gubble (only found in the instruction booklet) is very vague and is only used to make the game seem slightly more rational. The majority of the game is spent on the fictional planet Renigar, and many of the puzzles repeat themes of a certain world (the game is split into multiple worlds). Gubble was later rereleased for iOS. Gameplay Gubble is composed of 10 worlds; across these worlds are 104 sub-levels known as \\"Zymbots\\", which are usually maze-like in appearance. They are each filled with several enemies and tools. Other than being similar to a maze, their features are made to resemble certain features on other planets, such as lava, fields, deserts, snow fields, etc. In the PC version, each zymbot is named the same as that of the world plus an additional letter added to the end. For example, the very first zymbot, which is in a world named \\"Rennigar\\", is called Rennigara, while the seventh is called Rennigarp. Tools Tools are made to resemble those of a carpenter. A hammer, drill, screwdriver, a wrench, saw, mallet, and a sledgehammer are just a few of the tools used to deconstruct a level. Tools can be found within a zymbot and are used to remove the several nails, screws, bolts, etc. that hold a level together. Legacy Gubble 2 was released in 1998 for Windows 95 and 98. With similar gameplay to the first Gubble, Gubble 2 has 124 levels (or zymbots), and features new tools and enemies.Gubble.com: Press release 1999 One notable difference is that in Gubble 2, Gubble walks around the mazes, instead of hovering. From 2000 the game was also playable in full, online at PlayMachine.net, using pay-per-play tokensGubble.com: Gubble 2 page 2000 (PlayMachine.net was an attempt to bring game arcades online). The game came with ZymEdit, a piece of software to edit, or make new, levels for the game.Gubble.com: ZymEdit 2002 The game has another soundtrack of instrumental songs composed again by Seppo Hurme. Gubble Buggy Racer came out in 2000. In the game the player competes in buggy races across 8 different worlds (or tracks). The player can choose from Championship, Single Race or Time Trial modes as well as two player Head to Head or Deathmatch options. Unlike the non-violent gameplay of Gubble and Gubble 2, Gubble Buggy Racer contains a variety of super weapons to defeat the opponents.gamezone.com: Artworld UK Proudly Announce the Forthcoming Release of Gubble Buggy RacerLanzingerStudio.com: About page 2017 The game contains the same soundtrack as Gubble 2.

Eventually, the leader Ikki is betrayed by his mentor Takeuchi Sora and Sora then forms Genesis. Kogarasumaru is now determined to win the Gram Scale Tournament and dominate all other teams with their strength alone. The team currently has 3 riders that are Kings: Itsuki Minami (Sky/Storm King), Kazuma Mikura (Flame King), and Agito Wanijima (Fang King). Of these three, only Agito currently possesses his Regalia, Aeon Clock having stolen the Flame Regalia from Kazuma and Itsuki being the Storm King of the newly formed Hurricane Road is still having his Regalia built, though they now also possess the Rumble and Wind Regalia. Kogarasumaru was unqualified for the Gram Scale tournament because Ikki lost their registration data. However, they had a chance to qualify by going against the permanently seeded team Inorganic Net, led by the former Fang King, Falco. Inorganic Net is actually a computer program developed by Falco that has exact copies of the former Sleeping Forest members before they had disbanded, and each one possesses one of the original 8 regalia. During this battle, Kogarasumaru manages to outwit the former Sleeping Forest, and the victory is granted to Kogarasumaru by Emily's efforts. After this victory, Kogarasumaru wins their first Gram Scale bout against Highway Circus. While celebrating their victory, Benkei (of the AT syndicate Trident) arrives on a motorcycle, missing her right leg and carrying the Rumble Regalia. Kogarasumaru then battles against Sleipnir, a team made up of Wing Road riders. Itsuki Minami Ikki from the anime version. Voiced by: Kenta Kamakari (Japanese, TV), Nobuhiko Okamoto (Japanese, OVA); Chris Patton (English, Funimation dub), Scott Evans (English, Animax Asia dub) , known as , or frequently Crow, is a free spirited AT rider that has a natural affiliation for being in the sky. He is introduced to ATs by Noyamano family, whom he lives with due to his parents' disappearance. He eventually forms Kogarasumaru, and takes on the Trophaeum. Ikki is often characterized as a crow due to a small crow, K≈´u, using his hair as a nest. Ikki is able to see the Wing Road, and his peers often consider him to be the best candidate to become the next Sky King. He possesses two passive traits known as Hawk Eye and Trick Pass, which allow him to easily survey an area and utilize any part of it. Both are considered attributes necessary for a candidate to be Sky King. He trains under Sora to better utilize the wind, and he eventually obtains the incomplete Wind Regalia. He is able to use it to move quickly and fly, though he is unable to properly use its destructive power. The regalia is stolen by Sora and Nike, who are revealed to be antagonists harboring a grudge against Sleeping Forest. This leaves Ikki despondent and depressed, until Kazu reveals a message left behind by Spitfire after his death. Spitfire questions if Ikki has really \\"lost his wings,\\" which leads to Ikki to be proclaimed the \\"Storm King of the Hurricane Road\\" by his Principal in Chapter 169. His tuner, Kururu Sumeragi, promises that she will complete a new regalia for him. Recently, the Gram Scale Tournament has begun, but it was revealed that Ikki failed to submit the final registration. It is later revealed that Kazu has found a way to gain them entry into the Grand Scale Tournament by challenging Falco, the former Fang King and a member of the original Sleeping Forest. After defeating Falco's team, which was in fact a computerized version of the first Sleeping Forest, Kogarasumaru was awarded Falco's \\"eternal seed\\" in the tournament roster and entered the Gram Scale Tournament. He is best friends with Kazuma Mikura, the two are like brothers and care about each other more than anything else. Ikki is a very upbeat, zany person, who seemingly is as eccentric as just about everyone else in the universe of Air Gear. He delights in eating meat, a privilege he is often deprived of in the Noyamano household. He is rash, impulsive, and determined to do everything his way, whether for good or bad. In battle, he either comes off as his ordinary crazy and unpredictable personality, or his more serious, cold and steely side, which other characters have described as a rare occurrence, and as an intimidating scene. Ikki is totally hooked onto Air Trekking. He treats his ATs with care to such a standard that even his sisters feel jealous of, and his mind is constantly on Air Trekking; for example, during the Kyoto trip he fails to notice Ringo's affection initially, deadset on figuring out a 'Windmill Theory' that another Storm Rider has revealed to him as the secret behind the Rumble King. Ikki is a self-proclaimed genius and is very proud of himself, in particular his fighting abilities. In truth, he works very hard behind the others' backs, as is revealed when Kuu brings his friends to his secret training area, where the scars left over by his training could be seen in chapter 87. Though his attitude can be described as a lowlife, suitable for his gangster-like persona, and though he likes to go around doing insanely foolish things all the time, Ikki has a tendency to think beyond others' perceivable concept and at several intervals can spout deep philosophy that more often than not will impact others. One such incident was the Pomtemkin brothers' battle, where Ikki's plan caused an initial falling out among the Kogarasumaru, where in fact he had his own solution around that matter. Ikki, though easy to miss the obvious, can be very adept when it comes to spotting small details. In their first Parts War, he alone had noticed that Kazu's ATs were the most worn out among them, a mark of how much he practiced. He is noticed to be developing a new skill, as Kururu noticed that his AT was worn out. The day came for the Sleeping Forest and the Genesis to fight, Ringo went to the place where Ikki and his gang stayed and revealed her true feelings for Ikki while dressed as Croissant Mask. He told Simca if they could meet at the usual place, where the first time he loved ATs. In recent chapters, it's revealed that the trick Ikki was developing was called \\"Null Wind\\". It combines the power of all the major riders of Kogarasumaru and creates a storm of wind around Ikki, that stops all wing road riders tricks. With this, Ikki is able to win his battle against Sleipnir. There are three main women who have feelings/interests for Ikki first one being Ringo who he had always considered a sister (not blood related) but changed after he battled with her and realized she has feelings for him, Simca takes a huge interest in Ikki from the moment she met him, at one point wanted to become Ikki's tuner and finally Kururu who begins to develop feelings for Ikki this starting when he was hospitalized and eventually becomes his official tuner due to the tradition of the Sky King and Oath Queen pairing up. All three have feelings for him, although recently Ikki has shown signs of love towards Ringo. A lot of the Gravity Children, members of Sleipnir, brain chargers all regard a certain person called Dr/Mr/Uncle \\"Minami\\"; which is the same family name as Ikki. He is said to know most about what is in the top of the tower and the Sky Regalia. When Kururu wasn't able to be his link tuner because of her condition, Ikki suggests and chooses Ringo to be his substitute tuner since she has always been the one closest to him. Ringo confesses her love again and they kiss. Ikki then goes on to become the one true Sky King and gains the Sky Infinity Atmosphere, which allows him to nullify the planet's gravitational field. ; Tricks * Spinning Wallride Overbank 1800¬∞ * UPPER SOUL 23Roll * Method Air to Spin That Grab Moonride * Backward Cross Ridefall Upper Fang: \\"TWINCAM\\" * Roof Gap To Disaster One Foot \\"Air line\\" * Pile Tornado *: Relies on the \\"Vacuum Welding\\" skill to produce the effects of Tornadogenesis, funneling the air to such consistency that Ikki's kick produces a violent tornado. Ikki can ride the inner contours of the tornado - called the Limited Express - for increased momentum. * Moonstruck Numberless Grappler: The Wind Infinity Atmosphere. This trick is one of the best Ikki has, despite the fact that he utterly despises using it due to its lethality. It creates a localized hurricane which picks up debris and fires it at his opponent, creating a massive wall of destruction that cuts, impales, and smashes into his opponent. * Null Wind * A Windless Barrier - \\"ASTRAL MAGUS\\": The Storm Infinity Atmosphere, despite having been displayed against Takeuchi Sora WITHOUT the use of the Storm Regalia itself. It's a solo version of the Null Wind trick.  Kazuma Mikura  Voiced by: Kenn (Japanese, TV), Miyu Irino (Japanese, OVA); Clint Bickham (English, Funimation) , known as Kazu to his friends, is a childhood friend of Ikki who becomes influenced to take up AT and join Kogarasumaru. He is originally bullied by Ikki as a child, and he often feels like Ikki are more important than anything to him. In the manga, Kazu owns a Chihuahua named Chiwa. He takes up running at a later point, which eventually leads to him being an exceptionally fast AT rider. As he shows signs of following the Flame Road, Spitfire takes an interest in him and eventually proclaims Kazu to be the next Flame King. He is given the Flame Regalia before Spitfire's death, Kazu soon discovers this during his challenge to be the hero who saves the fallen from hell. Kazu soon realizes that he truly wants to fight against Ikki and they began their battle. Kazu fights an amazing battle against Ikki. Though it seems that Ikki had gained the upper hand, he left the fight a draw. Kazu was very satisfied with how he had become close to Ikki's level. It has been revealed that Kazu has adopted not only Spitfire's techniques, such as Afterburner, but also Aeon Clock's Time Manipulation, which he has been taught by the advanced training program left in Spitfire's ATs. Kazu has recently copied a trick called \\"Flame Lens\\" from his opponent. This allows him to create an illusion of himself and Agito and win them their fight. This trick is considered to be above special A-class and is a very powerful technique for a (tentative) king to use without regalia. In Chapter 320, Kazu was told about the true power of Flame Regalia by Spitfire. Flame Regalia's cyberairspace has the ability to record the \\"memory of runs\\" of every rider. So, a flame king can utilize the ability of other riders easily. Kazu is unaware of Emily's feelings for him and maybe does not reciprocate them, but he does show special attention to her from time to time, like rescuing her bracelet when a rival threw it into a river, holding her hand after the team was defeated by the White Wolves or hugging her after she retrieves the balloon in the match against Inorganic Net (former Sleeping Forest). ; Tricks * Super Stride IV \\"Sonic Boom\\" * AFTER BURNER *: This Trick takes advantage of direct power injection to the A-T's wheel motor resulting in a significant increase of thrust and supersonic takeoff. * TIME *: Learned from Spitfire's VR program. It restricts an individual's movement with precision kicks and palm thrusts targeting the vital nerve points on the chin, back of the head and bottom of the neck, effectively diminishing a person's freedom of movement. Individuals experience impaired vision, haziness, and sensations of burning paralysis. * AGITO & AKITO √ó KAZU Grand Fang Fire Bird *: This trick combines elements from Agito & Akito's Bloody Blade Fang and Kazu's Flame Road to produce a fiery ->Fang<-. * FLAME LENS * HOLE NINE HEAVEN'S DOOR [√Üttir] *: This trick turns every data that had been recorded inside the Flame Regalia's memory (Lon Houtz Bourne Street) into anything. In the battle with Nike, Kazu can use Aeon's Thorn Whip, Yoshitsune's Rumble Windmill, Onigiri's Organic Nitrogen, and even Nike's Gem. Issa Mihotoke Voiced by: Hitoshi Bifu (Japanese, TV), Kenta Miyake (Japanese, OVA); Mark Laskowski (English, Funimation) , popularly known as , has an extremely large body that he uses to his advantage in battle. Before he became part of Kogarasumaru, he is the leader of the team , which is defeated by Ikki. He appears to be obese, but his body is only ten percent fat. His size is actually caused by a large amount of blood pooling in his gut from overeating. He also has the ability to manipulate that blood and send it to his muscles, causing him to temporarily have a slimmer, cut figure and even cause his limbs to become longer. He uses brass knuckles-esque gloves in combat, which combined with his superhuman strength is truly devastating. Spitfire states that Buccha has the skills to potentially rival that of a King's, but because of his brash actions in battle, he cannot utilize them fully. To overcome this, he underwent Buddhist training with his father, and has come to trust his heart as well as his teammates more. This is displayed in the virtual battle with the former Sleeping Forest, in which he is able to hold back the physically strongest of the kings by himself. He also learns how to further control his bloodflow, now able to direct it into his legs in order to hugely increase his speed. He eventually earns the title of Mountain King after defeating Orca in an underwater deathmatch. Onigiri Voiced by: Masami Kikuchi (Japanese, TV) Shintaro Ohata (Japanese, OVA); Greg Ayres (English, Funimation) is one of Ikki's childhood friends who joins Kogarasumaru. His parents run a bad Chinese restaurant. He rides on a single AT by sitting upside down on it, mainly to look up the skirts of his female schoolmates. This proves useful during Kogarasumaru's battle against Behemoth, when Onigiri fights against Ry≈ç Mimasaka who uses her tattoos on her body to hypnotize her opponents, but since Onigiri is looking at her tattoos from an upside-down angle, he remains unaffected and is able to defeat her. He has an unusual way of using his perspiration, usually during overall perverted moments, to create illusions, which he nicknames the \\"Smell Road\\". Though Ikki is perverted as well, he is nowhere near to being perverted as Onigiri. Although he appears weak, when he pushes himself to his limits he can fight evenly with a King as seen in the team battle with the Virtual Sleeping Forest. His skill was enough to intimidate even Kilik and Rika Noyamano. Kogarasumaru's first win in the Gram Scale Tournament is in part due to Onigiri's sweat dripping all over the course, causing the leader of the Highway Circus team to slip. Akito/Agito/Lind Wanjima Voiced by: Kokoro Kikuchi (Japanese, TV), Ryoko Shiraishi (Japanese, OVA); Blake Shepard (English, Funimation), Andrea Kwan (English, Animax Asia) and are two personalities that make up the Fang King, of the Bloody Road. They are originally part of the Wind SWAT team, in which they are treated like a tool by their older brother, Kaito. Ikki eventually saves them, and they join Kogarasumaru. They switch who is in control by using an eye patch. Akito is innocent and non-violent. He becomes attracted to Ikki, much to Ikki's discontent. He states he was the original Fang King until he became disgusted with himself and became unable to use AT. Agito then appears and starts using ATs, while following his own violent and bloodthirsty nature. He tends to swear/cuss a lot and uses four hooks dangling from straps on his legs to battle and tear people apart. When equipped with the Fang Regalia, he releases a pressurized \\"Fang\\" through the instantaneous acceleration and braking of the A-T's wheel motors, vacuuming and compressing air into a piercing shock wave. As the manga develops, Agito grows to respect Ikki and his strength. In some scenes in the manga, Agito is shown to be very weak while sleeping, so much that the guys put him in some very humorous scenes because of his weakness. Added info about his weakness is about his physique. It's obvious that he is thin and short, and that the only reason why he is strong is because of motivation, willpower, and pride. It is also learned that Akito had been acting as Agito's tuner up until now. However, he wasn't able to fully hear his own biorhythm, only allowing him to keep his other half's A-T and Regalia barely operational. Because roughly 76% of the Fang Regalia was not operational, Agito had difficulty with fully utilizing his \\"Fangs\\". It isn't until Yayoi tunes him that the Fang Regalia is fully operational and complete. ; Tricks * AGITO Ride fall Bloody roll, soul 1800¬∞ * Backward Cross Ridefall Upper Fang: \\"TWINCAM\\" *: A surprise tag-team attack. * AGITO Bloody fang Ride fall \\"Leviathan\\" * AGITO Bloody Blade Fang * Bloody Road ->Saucer Crush<\\\\- * AGITO & AKITO √ó KAZU Grand Fang Fire Bird Another personality, , emerges during the battle with Orca. He claims to be the original personality and he is much stronger than the other two, utilizing the Fang Regalia on a different level. He is a \\"brain charger\\", or a person who has been \\"charged\\" with the ability of gravity children. Lind's eyes have crosses on them, similar to those of gravity children, but his eyes have two crosses, with one set at a 45 degree angle and overlaid over the other. He does not care for others. It is unknown if he has any feelings at all towards anyone, including Akito and Agito Wanijima, though he has displayed more human compassion towards the then-incapacitated Yayoi Nakayama, yet, is revealed \\"fake affection\\" after Orca falsely hit Yayoi in the face, that Lind said, \\"Aren't there 4 more billion of that kind? If so, then, I don't need her...\\". She kissed him in chapter 194, while battling Orca underwater, to give him air so that he could continue battling. It is revealed by Thor of Slepinir that Lind found the \\"original\\" sky king, with the \\"answer\\". In chapter 291 it is revealed that Lind is brain charger #0 and his personality is basically a clone of the first Thorn Queen, \\"The Wings of Beginnings\\"-Gazelle. It was shown in flashbacks that Gazelle and Kaito met and started a relationship, but were relentlessly pursued by the Takeuchi brothers, ultimately resulting in Gazelle's death. In Trick 300, it is revealed that Gazelle was pregnant when she died and the fetus was removed and artificially enhanced by a mysterious benefactor. The child later appeared to Kaito with a note, thus making Agito/Akito/Lind, Kaito's son, not his brother. Emily Adachi Voiced by: Shoko Ishii (Japanese, TV), Yu Kobayashi (Japanese, OVA); Kira Vincent-Davis (English, Funimation), Candice Moore (English, Animax Asia) is part of the track team. She and other members of the team are initially forced to harass Ikki by Buccha team. After it disbands, she and Yayoi become supporters of Kogarasumaru. She has a large crush on Kazu, and tries to tend to him when possible. Her family owns a Banana business. She eventually joins the Kogarasumaru and acts as back-up, though her skills are unpolished. She has the strength and endurance of a man, much to the surprise of her opponents (even Kilik), which she refers to as \\"The Power of Love\\". She plays a crucial part in Kogarasumaru's entry into the Gram Scale tournament, acting as the 'Panther' in an A-class virtual reality battle against a simulated former Sleeping Forest team. It is her grasping of the coveted balloon that ends the game in Kogarasumaru's favor. Yayoi Nakayama Voiced by: Rieko Yoshimoto (Japanese, TV), Saori Hayami (Japanese, OVA); Stephanie Wittels (English, Funimation) is initially forced to harass Ikki by Buccha's team, though she supports Kogarasumaru later. Nakayama has the ability to communicate with Ikki's crow and to tell the exact time, down to a second - a trait that is shared amongst the more affluent tuners of Tool Toul To. It was first seen that she has a crush on Ikki on the chapter against the SabelTigers but after the trip to Kyoto she lost interest in him. Her father owns Nakayama Construction. It was said by Ine Makigami that she saw potential in Yayoi as an AT-Tuner, she even mistook Yayoi as the team's tuner. In fact, during Kogarasumaru's battle against the original Sleeping Forest in Inorganic Net, when Agito gets injured, she is the one who tunes him back to health and finally completes the Fang Regalia that had been merged into his A-T. Agito never seems to recognize Yayoi without her braids, always yelling who she is whenever she bothers him with her hair down. While in training camp, Yayoi fretted over Agito who was overworking himself to produce a stronger Fang. Emily convinced her to kidnap him while he was asleep and bring him somewhere relaxing to help soothe him. Oddly, when Agito woke up (tied up) on a boat in the middle of the lake with Yayoi, he didn't insult her or use his usual profanity, instead keeping quiet while she told him a story about the lake. When Lind appeared during the underwater battle against Orca, she kissed him to give him her air. Orca, annoyed at her interference, slashed her face with his AT, after which Lind complained that Yayoi wasn't that important to him in the first place. Yayoi has recently become Agito's tuner but she mostly acts as an observer during Kogarasumaru's battles. Sleeping Forest The current is led by Ringo, the Thorn Queen. Its purpose is to make sure that the Sky Regalia stays within the Trophaeum by winning the Gram Scale Tournament. Ringo Noyamano Voiced by: Mariya Ise (Japanese, TV), Haruka Tomatsu (Japanese, OVA); Luci Christian (English, Funimation), Andrea Kwan (English, Animax Asia) is successor of Sleeping Forest and the Thorn Queen, of the Sonia Road. She is a second generation gravity child and the only one completely unaffected by pressure in the Trophaeum due to the pressure which the Sonia Road exerts on the user's body, leading to her being undefeated there. Her Sonia Road gives her graceful and deadly agility that eventually takes its toll on her body, except when inside of the 'forest' of Trophaeum. She is in love with Ikki, but she is unable to relay her feelings. This also makes it hard for her to fulfill her purpose as Sleeping Forest's leader while supporting Ikki. She helps Kogarasumaru in times of trouble under the guise of Croissant Mask, even coming to Kogarasumaru's aid when it was revealed that Ikki's negligence had prevented the team from registering. Ringo is a kind, studious girl who wears thick glasses, always there to support Ikki since they were young. She started out with a sisterly affection for Ikki, which eventually progressed to infatuation and eventually deep love, which she still tries to deny though it is clear to everyone except perhaps Ikki himself. Ringo has always let Ikki do things as he liked, turning an eye away during his gangster era as the leader of Eastside 'Undefeatable Babyface'. She is a pushover, her friends Emily and Yayoi easily manipulating her to doing things for them, and the teachers always picking on her rather than Ikki and gang. However, as a Storm Rider she is more strong-willed as a person, and punishes the Skull Saders, who attacked Ikki, with the other members of the Noyamano household, for misusing ATs. Ringo, encumbered by her duty as the leader of the Sleeping Forest, is put in a difficult position, due to the power struggle between Sleeping Forest, who seeks to protect the Sky Regalia, and Genesis, who seeks to take the Sky Regalia. She was put in a dilemma when Ikki was given reign over Genesis; since that directly made him her enemy. Ikki taking over Genesis caused Sleeping Forest to respond in kind, attacking and paralyzing Simca, who had recruited Ikki, waistdown. Ringo led the attack as the true successor of the Sleeping Forest, 'Crazy Apple'. 'Crazy Apple' was eventually fully brought out when Ikki learns the truth behind Simca's attack, followed shortly by Ringo's unwanted kiss with her tuner Kanon. After realizing that Ikki had reached a level of riding where he was a serious threat to Sleeping Forest, she put herself in battle with a serious Ikki, and decided to crush him and remove him forcibly from the world of ATs, so that he would not die by getting caught in between. The Ringo when she is 'Crazy Apple' seems to be an entirely different person, taunting, cold, and ferocious in her attacks. She mocks Ikki for his little tricks and doesn't hold back in all her attacks, even releasing the Thorn Regalia with the intention of taking Ikki down. She destroyed Ikki's Infinity Atmosphere because he was armed with the fake Wind Regalia, though she took equal damage in return. Her infinity atmosphere is called \\" 'Infinite Chain' Turquoise Sonia\\" Eventually Ikki came to understand Ringo to a level where words were not needed and after Ringo fell, exhausted from the race, he picks her up and told her he forgives her and thanked her for going easy on Simca. He then finished the race with a draw, carrying Ringo all the way to the end point of the race. Ringo later learns that Ikki was going to leave the Noyamano household to pursue his own path (and to prevent a recurrence of such events) and Ringo acknowledges his path and let him 'go outside his cage to find his wings'. Before he left, Ringo finally confessed to Ikki. Just before the battle against Genesis, Sora reveals a captive Rika and is trying to force the team to give up their advantage in the forest. Ringo, as leader, decides to abandon Rika in favor of keeping their advantage. This puts her at odds with Mikan, who believes they should go rescue their sister. When Mikan decides to go help out Rika despite knowing that her life is in considerable danger, Ringo forces Mikan to duel with her in order for Mikan to leave to help Rika, because Mikan would face certain death if she went against Genesis alone. Ikki, eavesdropping on their conversation, decides to help them out by going out himself to save Rika. This reinforces Ringo's love for Ikki and she realizes that Ikki has always been there for her in her time of need. In the moment for the tuning of Ikki's regalia, with Kururu unable to do it, Ikki chose her to do it because she's the girl that always be by his side and the only one that really knows him in that way she became Ikki's Link Tuner. Mikan Noyamano Voiced by: Seika Hosokawa (Japanese); Shelley Calene-Black (English, Funimation), Emily Woo- Zeller (English, Animax Asia) is the second eldest of the Noyamano sisters and a gravity child. She is a fiery-tempered tomboyish girl with short messy hair, and the disciplinarian of the group. She often beats up Ikki with her wrestling moves. She has a soft spot for retro games, something which Simca uses to initially gain her favor. Just before the battle against Genesis, Sora reveals a captive Rika and is trying to force the team to give up their advantage in the forest. Mikan is the only one who chooses to save Rika over keeping their advantage, even going so far as to quit the team in order to do so. She mentions that if it were Rika alone who was in danger, she wouldn't bother saving her, but because Rika was pregnant, she would do anything to save her. She also states that she just wants Rika to be happy, countering her previous statements for saving her. She is constantly referred to as a gorilla, due to her brute strength and irritable personality. Also known as Wind God \\"FuuJin\\" in the Sleeping forest at the newest chapter, who runs Gale road. Shiraume Noyamano Voiced by: Yukiko Hanioka (Japanese); Hilary Haag (English, Funimation), Candice Moore (English, Animax Asia) , known as Ume to her family, is the youngest of the sisters. Her hobby is the creation of puppets in the guise of gorgons, and she's always seen carrying one with her. She is supposedly the weakest member of Sleeping Forest in terms of AT fighting skills, though as a gravity child, she is able to battle extremely well in the Tropheum. Ume is the youngest child in the Noyamano family, being only 10 years old, and thus is more doted on among the sisters. She keeps to herself for the most part, playing with her weird dolls, which she apparently makes herself. Her personality is more quiet and passive as compared to her aggressive sisters, and she seems to have eccentric tastes. She wears a strange eye patch in her hair and is often dressed in long-sleeved dresses that is much too large for her it seems. As with the other Noyamano sisters, she dotes on Ikki like a part of their family, though Ringo is the only one to have stepped from a brotherly-sisterly love to a romantic relationship in the family. Though she is the weakest of the Gravity Children, she can easily defeat Ikki in the Tropheum, due to her being accustomed in fighting in 0G, though, this was in a comical context and therefore, her true capability is unknown. She is often bullied on by Ikki, which she often holds grudges, but loves him all the same. She introduced Ikki to the 'Sensei' who designed Kogarasumaru's emblem and Team Shirts. It has been confirmed that Ume is a Ring Road rider, and it is likely that she could use it in an offensive manner like Kanon does. Her skill with technology is shown to be of extraordinary standards, from creating a 'rocket AT' for Ikki early in the manga (which was scrapped due to her not being in her right senses at that time) to creating strange spiderlike robotic machines which she uses to travels on. Her speed is shown to be on par with genius Tuner Kururu, as they both repaired the robot they were riding on the second it was dismantled by a Time Road user. Gabishi is the current Horn King who has a penchant for removing large amounts of flesh from faces of his victims using his AT's \\"Hatch-Venom.\\" His regalia is able to push the heat resulting from a sudden stop into an \\"Air Cannon\\". This attack is made by kicking the air twice in rapid succession, generating the heat in the first kick and sending it towards his opponent in the next. The attack looks like a laser that is even able to melt giant holes in metal billboards, slightly similar to Agito's Fangs. He had chased Kazu and Emily, mistaking Kazu for Ikki and intending to kill him. However, Aeon Clock stops him and fights him, but is overwhelmed. While Kazu was debating on what to do, Emily stepped forward and attacked Gabishi with brute strength. Surprised, Gabishi stops the battle and attempts to say something to Emily but was interrupted when Nue punched Gabishi and ended up catching him. Gabishi was the opponent who had defeated Rising Road's Nue, but Nue rematched against him later and defeated him. Ohm is the current Water Queen. Using the Lather Road, she can saturate air into water with her regalia, which allows her to utilize an attack called \\"Bubblegum Crisis.\\" She can only attack from the rear, which forces her to face backwards in order to attack. She creates giant bubbles which she usually uses to surround her opponents to finish them off. When the bubbles explode they cause the water in the opponents body to vibrate causing internal damage, which she used to paralyze Simca. They can also be used for defense by gathering them in one spot to block an opponents attack. She likes sweet food, especially lollipops, and strong men. Kilik * See Kilik from Original Sleeping Forest Original Sleeping Forest Sora Takeuchi Voiced by: Mitsuru Miyamoto (Japanese, TV), Kenichi Suzumura (Japanese, OVA); Vic Mignogna (English, Funimation), David Lee McKinney (English, Animax Asia) is the founder of the original Sleeping Forest, the first Wind King, and the main antagonist. He is a Gravity Child who wishes to find the Sky Regalia, so he spreads the initial rumor of the Regalia's existence and creates the team for that purpose. He is generally carefree and extremely perverted, though he is later revealed to be cold and manipulative. He is eventually betrayed by Kilik, after he finds out that Sora had ulterior motives, as he wished to use the Sky Regalia to take control of the world, and had manipulated the information on the Tower. The ensuing battle and defeat leads to his loss of the Wind Regalia and the use of his legs, as well as several defections from Sleeping Forest. He continues to use a wheelchair full-time for six years while waiting for an opportune time to put his plans into motion once again. As the one-time leader of Sleeping Forest, he was romantically involved with Rika, a relationship which ended following Kilik's coup d'√©tat that left Sora permanently using a specially customized AT-wheelchair. Sora began to mentor Ikki at the request of Rika and in the process rekindled their shattered romance. Though initially interested in grooming Ikki into an accomplished successor, Sora soon reveals Ikki is just a means to obtain a newly finished Wind Regalia and begins implementing new plans for global dominance, although it was also said that If Ikki obtained the completed Wind Regalia and became the Wind King, he would have been a rider not even Sora could have defeated. This turn-of-events also brought to light numerous revelations including his AT-tuned biomechatronics legs and a twin brother, Nike. After attaining the Sky Regalia and becoming the Sky King, Sora reveals that his actions are based in his all-consuming nihilistic hatred of humanity, as he sees them as nothing but willing slaves who he, as their new god, must lead and control. At the climax of the series, Sora defeats the current and former Sleeping Forest but is finally defeated by Ikki, who becomes the true Sky King. He is last seen in prison and wheelchair- bound once more. Rika Noyamano Voiced by: Naoko Matsui (Japanese, TV), Rina Satou (Japanese, OVA); Christine Auten (English, Funimation), Emily Woo- Zeller (English, Animax Asia) is the eldest of the Noyamano sisters. She acts like a typical older sister and takes care of the family. To support her sisters and Ikki, she works as Destler Bartlett, a female pro-wrestler. During the time when Ikki discovers AT, she is out on a national tour with her wrestling promotion. Unknown to Ikki at first, she is the former Thorn Queen of the original Sleeping Forest, which required her to utilizes her hip joints as the base of her moves. The disadvantage of her Sonia Road was that it took quite a toll on her body, making her tire easily. She is one of two members of the original Sleeping Forest that is not a Gravity Child, the other being Ine. Throughout her entire stay in Sleeping Forest and afterwards, she was unaware of the significance of the Sky Regalia and the true intentions of Sora. She was initially Sora's girlfriend, though they fell apart after Kilik's betrayal. She also quits using AT, and she initially fears that Ikki will suffer the same fate as Sora if he continues to be a Storm Rider, although she is finally convinced of his talent after a strange battle with him and a team consisting of Sora and his dogs. She and Sora talk often afterward and eventually reconnect, and she is eventually impregnated with his child. In her youth Rika was displayed as a lone ranger who achieved the right to use the Thorn Regalia in her early teens by herself, even though she was not a Gravity Child. She battled off opposing enemies aiming for her title as the Thorn Queen and aimed to take down all the teams in the area alone. In addition, she found the means to support her large family by herself, though they were bordering poverty. On one of her fights she met Sora, who she christened as the '120 Yen', for the iced coffee he bought her. Sora appeared as one of her fans, and later became her companion and friend. On one occasion, she revealed to Sora that she had caught wind of a group who was reputedly composed of the strongest Kings of the era, and wanted to take them down. Only upon arrival of the battlefield did she find out that the team was none other than Sora's Sleeping Forest, and that he was the leader, the man closest to becoming Sky King at that time. Sora extended his offer to include her on the team, and because she desired to remain at Sora's side, she complied. After joining, Rika was romantically involved with Sora, which was also a major cause for Kilik's jealousy. When Kilik declared betrayal upon Sora, she was not present for the battle on either side, presumably because she was uninformed by both Sora and Kilik, who had only recently confessed to her the previous night. She arrived too late to find the battle already over, Kilik the winning party, Sora and his supporters beaten and robbed of their Regalia. Sora, grievously injured by the battle in both legs, lost hope and broke up with Rika, leaving her the Sleeping Forest emblem, which she passed down to her sister Ringo later. Afraid of a repeat of the same incidence, present-day Rika attempted to stop Ikki from going down the same road as Sora, as she had already recognized Ikki as bearing many similar traits to Sora. This is further encouraged by Ikki's climbing of Tokyo Tower when he was a child, which resulted in him falling off and getting carried away by the eight-winged crow. Having already seen the signs in Ikki, she often approached Sora to talk about him; in fact Sora has commented before that she has only ever come to look for him to talk about Ikki since the day they parted. Rika tries to stop Ikki from AT-ing by challenging him in a match, but is defeated when Ikki exceeds her expectations. She then recognizes Ikki's strength, and supports his goal from that day on, though she still takes care to limit Ikki by locking his body with heavy weights, which Ikki grows accustomed to quickly. Rika has sworn off ATs, though she still retains her skills from her prime. She does not play a role in the current power struggle in the AT world, though she is shown to be aware of it. Some evidence is that she guessed Kanon's motives in aggravating Ringo and Ikki into a fight, and that she advised Ringo to make up her mind about Ikki, who would surely become an enemy to Sleeping Forest in the future. However, there are no signs that she knows about Sora retaking his place as Wind King and making use of Ikki. Whether this is because Sora is keeping this from her or if she does not want to talk about it is unknown. Just before the battle against Genesis, Sora reveals a captive Rika and is trying to force the current Sleeping Forest to give up their advantage in the forest. Mikan is the only one to choose to save Rika and also reveals that their sister is pregnant, which is all the more reason to rescue her. Sora later brainwashes her and she assists Sora in battling Ikki and Ringo. Rika is a brain charger, the back-up 'copy' of Gazelle (revealed in chapter 319). Rika was likely made into a back-up shortly after Gazelle was made, hence the lack of memories and emotion that Gazelle had gained and passed onto her son Akito/Agito. It was also due to her being this 'back-up copy' that Sora had (indirectly) given her the Thorn Regalia after Gazelle's death and later got her to join SF. Falco Voiced by: Hiroki Yasumoto (Japanese) Falco is the original Fang King and a Gravity Child. He is originally a slim and slender blond, who wears a fine suit and bowler hat. He is capable of firing several \\"solid\\" Fangs simultaneously without injury. He quits after the destruction of Sleeping Forest and becomes a weak visual novel playing old man with a pot belly who no longer interacts with the outside world in any meaningful way. Falco holds the Gram Scale Tournament's \\"Eternal Seed\\", meaning he always has a reserved spot in the tournament as the team \\"Inorganic Net\\". Inorganic Net is a digital copy of the original Sleeping Forest within a computer. He also has the authority to give his spot to others, given they're capable of defeating Inorganic Net. Falco was responsible for the protection of Skylink (for an unknown duration of time), which is a component of the Sky Regalia. Dontores Voiced by: Kenji Nomura (Japanese) Dontores is the original Rumble King whose Regalia is placed on his forearms rather than the AT like Yoshitsune. He is considered the weakest member within Sleeping Forest by his teammates (though probably not including Ine). In the past, he was possibly a famous rapper, continuing to hold concerts during his time with Sleeping Forest. Using his regalia he manipulates the density in the air creating solid defensive walls that can push back his enemies, and in enclosed spaces he is able to use the echoes generated off the walls to amplify his power many times over. This helps him generate dense blasts of air to hammer at his opponents. It is called his \\"audience of the overroad\\" since the echoes respond like the audience of a crowd of tens of thousands of people. When not in use his regalia is disguised as a boom box which he carries across his shoulder. Black Burn Voiced by: Satoshi Hino (Japanese) Black Burn is the original Thunder King whose Regalia uses artificial lightning as a destructive force as well as a wire system similar to Nue's. Apparently he has a son, as briefly mentioned by his copy during Sleeping Forest/Inorganic Net vs. Kogarasumaru fight. This son is later revealed to be Nue, the current Thunder King. After the fall of old Sleeping Forest, Black Burn became an alcoholic (one of the reasons for the strained relationship with his son) but continued air trek as the masked Hanged Man. Spitfire * See Genesis' Spitfire Kilik Voiced by: Koki Miyata (Japanese) is the former Gem King of the first Sleeping Forest. He is a gravity child along with his twin sister, Simca, and his childhood friend, Sora, and he is the most gifted of the first generation. While in Sleeping Forest, he develops a crush on Rika. He eventually learns that Sora has evil intentions, so he rebels against him with other gravity children. He defeats Sora, took away the Wind Regalia, and then loses his own regalia to Nike. He judges people using a one hundred point system with random variables. After Sora reappears in the AT world, he begins training in extreme pressure in order to stand up against him. He follows the Gaia Road, which, in his case, is able to memorize and finally engrave any riding script from a rider no matter how fast, high, and tricky it is. He is seen training to become as hard as diamond. When he finally faces Sora once more, Kilik is held back by his memories of their former friendship and is killed handily, his last words being a declaration of his hatred, having realized that Sora is utterly irredeemable. Sora then defiles his corpse for fun before he begins his fight with Ikki. Ine Makigami Voiced by: Sayaka Ohara (Japanese) is the first Pledge Queen of Tool Toul To and of the original Sleeping Forest. She is also knowledgeable in medicine and runs her own hospital. Though none of the Gravity Children require tuners, Spitfire still has a close relationship with her before his death. She decides to break the rule of neutrality of Tool Toul To (along with many of its other members) and help Kogarasumaru develop. She passes down her title of Pledge Queen to Kururu Sumeragi. Behemoth is a team with the strength of Class A riders, but stay Class-D by not winning the three wins required to advance. Their reason is so they can prey on other Stormrider teams. Akira leads the team and the four strongest members are known as the . Akira Ud≈ç Voiced by: Kenji Nojima (Japanese); Michael Dalmon (English, Funimation) is the leader of the team, developing it after leaving the Wind SWAT team and winning the Fang Regalia in a battle against Agito. He is highly skilled in the Bloody Road and was able to evolve the Fang attack into the more deadly Gigaer Cross, which overpowered Agito's Leviathan Fang (although Agito was performing the attack with normal ATs). He is defeated by Agito and Ikki, returns the Fang Regalia, and rejoins Wind. He is injured by the Takeuchi brothers afterward. His immense strength is the result of a genetic condition he was born with that means his muscles are up to nine times more dense than a normal humans. He shares this condition with Mitsuru Bando. Mitsuru Bando Voiced by: Hiro Yuuki (Japanese); David Wald (English, Funimation) , sometimes referred to as the \\"Cyclops Hammer\\", specializes in close combat, using his ultra-destructive punching power as his main weapon. When coupled with the speed of his AT, Mitsuru's punches result in damage of diabolical proportions. During the Behemoth VS Kogarasumaru challenge, he fights Ikki and is thoroughly defeated with a heavy body blow. With the arrest of Akira at the hands of the Wind SWAT team, Band≈ç now seeks to establish his own Storm Rider team. Mitsuru has a strange appearance, as his eyes are completely black. His immense strength is the result of a genetic condition he was born with, myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy, that means his muscles are up to seven times more dense than a normal humans. He shares this condition with Akira Ud≈ç. Fuumei Goshogawara Voiced by: Yasuyuki Kase (Japanese); Jay Hickman (English, Funimation) , known as the \\"Hecatonchires Bomb\\", dislocates his already long arms to attack opponents from a great distance and use them to grapple enemies. He is often characterized as a digger wasp. Ryo Mimasaka Voiced by: Miki Itou (Japanese); Elizabeth Byrd (English, Funimation) , known as , uses tattoos, which are almost invisible to the naked eye, to hypnotize the opponent to the point that their metabolism slows down so much that it leads to paralysis. She is, however, defeated by Onigiri whose unorthodox style of riding on his head reverses the tattoo effects and makes him more powerful to the point where she submits to him instead. She is very close to Sano Yasuyoshi and may have romantic feelings for him, having known him from their school days, and works under him. She sacrifices herself to save Sano from being killed by Nike; though she is later revealed to be alive but on life-support and held hostage by Genesis in order to force Sano to work for them. In Chapter 161 it is revealed that she follows the path of the Gaia/Jade Road. Yasuyoshi Sano * See Genesis' Yasuyoshi Sano Genesis is a massive team under the command of Simca. It is a conglomeration of numerous teams that have united under one banner, resulting in what is known to be the largest, and most powerful team in history. It is originally presented by Simca as a tool to overthrow the idea of the Trophaeumm, though it is later shown to be a creation of Nike to obtain the Sky Regalia along with Sora. Simca attempts to intervene by having Ikki become the Wind King and take control of Genesis, though the two brothers stop the plan. Simca Voiced by: Rie Tanaka (Japanese, TV), Ayako Kawasumi (OVA); Monica Rial (English, Funimation) , also known as and the \\"Migratory Bird\\", is the leader of the group. She is the twin sister of Kilik and a first generation gravity child. She was part of Tool Toul To until after Sleeping Forest is destroyed and eventually works under Nike. She takes great interest in Ikki, whom she believes is destined to one day become the legendary Sky King. She eventually has her hair cut short, abandons her usual care-free attitude, and focuses on strengthening Ikki, all out of her new found love for him. She is soon attacked by Sleeping Forest, however, and temporarily placed into a wheelchair. After Sora and Nike take over, she attempts to help Kogarasumaru enter the tournament, and she and Ikki promise to ride together afterward. Ine once exclaimed that Kururu (The New Pledge Queen) had tuning abilities equal to Simca; Simca was meant to be the succeeding Pledge Queen after Ine, but she left Tool Toul To after the breakdown of the old Sleeping Forest. Early in the manga, Ikki fell in love with her, and she constantly appears naked to him or allows him to hug her while she's naked as a reward. This is done much to Ringo's chagrin. Spitfire Voiced by: Kenjiro Tsuda (Japanese, TV), Tomokazu Seki (Japanese, OVA); Jay Hickman (English, Funimation) is one of the gravity children, who escaped from the tower and is also said to be one of the gravity children to be gotten rid of, along with Nike and Sora. He is the first Flame King and one of the original members of Sleeping Forest. As the Flame King, he can ride at such high speeds that they create the illusion of flames due to the heat caused by the friction of his wheels on the ground. He can also create the illusion of stopping time, much like Yasuyoshi Sano, one of his former subordinates. Sometime after Sleeping Forest's defeat at the hands of Kilik, he joins Genesis and becomes Simca's close friend and advisor. He is in control of three teams and is a highly sought after hair stylist in everyday life. He begins to acknowledge Ikki after talking to Simca and witnessing some of his battles, such as the race with Buccha (whom he knew and advised well before he had any ties to Ikki and the rest of Kogarasumaru). He later takes an interest in Kazu and proclaims him to be the next Flame King after realizing the true purpose of Genesis and Takeuchi Sora and knowing that his own end might come near as a result of his betrayal. He and Sano eventually battle Sora and Nike using a combination of their styles known as the Apollo Road, though they lose and Spitfire is killed. He leaves behind the Flame Regalia and his will in the form of a video file that contains the truth about Genesis and an advanced training program that is able to recognize speech and react accordingly. Nue Voiced by: Miyu Irino (Japanese); Kyle Jones (English, Funimation) is the Thunder King and a second generation Gravity Child. He leads the team \\"Black Crow\\", which is made up of twenty other, much younger second generation Gravity Children, who help him create illusions by manipulating the Earth's magnetic field. He has full body Regalia that manipulates electricity and magnetism, allowing him to create hallucinations and powerful electric attacks with a built-in wire system. Though he respects and occasionally helps Kogarasumaru, he remains with Genesis because Sora has promised to change the world enough to enable the Gravity Children under his care to live a normal life. In Trick 307, it is revealed that a rider named Hanged Man, who was able to counter the power of Nue's regalia, is his father. He battles Ikki aboard the aircraft carrier and loses, surrendering his Regalia's cores. Yasuyoshi Sano Voiced by: Hiroaki Hirata (Japanese, TV), Tomokazu Sugita (Japanese, OVA); John Gremillion (English, Funimation) , known as , is an extremely intelligent individual who is able to create the illusion of manipulating the flow of time using the Flame Road. He is originally part of Spitfire's team, following the same road, until he decides to leave and join Behemoth. After Behemoth's defeat, he joins with Genesis, serving as Simca's advisor, counselor, and occasional chauffeur. He eventually also serves Ikki and his team in the same manner. Although he is normally serious, he is often used as a comic relief, with his homosexuality being a recurring gag. He is very close to Mimasaka Ryo and may also be attracted to her, as he is apparently furious at the Takeuchi brothers after she is \\"killed\\", which is contrary to his usually calm and rational demeanor. He is eventually shown to be working under his father's orders in an attempt to obtain the Sky Regalia, though he has his own goals. He helps Spitfire fight Sora and Nike though he is defeated and thought to be dead along with Spitfire. He is later shown to be alive and once again working for Genesis when he steals the Flame Regalia from Kazu, with no explanation to his apparent betrayal. However, the battle had left him scarred and with most of his body replaced with prosthetic, and Mimasaka on life support. After a confrontation with Sleeping Forest, a tracker on his body is inadvertently destroyed, and he reveals that Genesis had been using it to keep track of him. Free of listening ears, he asks Mikan to relay to Ikki that he is still loyal to him. However, because Genesis still has Mimasaka imprisoned, he cannot rejoin him. In recent chapters, he is shown fighting alongside Kazu and is killed off by Nike. Before the final blow, he hands over the Flame Regalia to Kazu. Yoshitsune Voiced by: Mitsuaki Madono (Japanese); Jason Douglas (English, Funimation) is a brilliant, although somewhat eccentric, strategist who holds the title of Rumble King. He is the leader of the Kansai Storm Rider syndicate \\"Trident\\". His Regalia, \\"Ram Jet\\", is able to absorb wind, completely nullifying the \\"wind\\" of anyone and decreasing their air time. After Ikki impresses him by completing a challenge, he helps train and advise Kogarasumaru until Sora takes over Genesis. He decides to keep his alliance with Genesis as it will be beneficial to Trident and he wishes to one day fight against Kogarasumaru. He is a skilled Air Trekker, able to substitute empty cans as his Ram Jet Regalia and is an extremely skilled Tetris player. He is also capable of fighting on par with the Gravity Children. However, in the recent battle of Genesis vs. Trident, Yoshitsune has been confirmed to be dead. After destroying the mecha that invaded Osaka and killing the two members of Genesis, Gawain and Percival, Yoshitsune is unable to fight and is finished off by Nike. Benkei Voiced by: Wakana Yamazaki (Japanese); Robin Terry (English, Funimation) is Yoshitsune's beautiful and skilled second-in-command. She is often portrayed as a panther because her fighting style and aggressive behavior both in and out of battle and is completely loyal to Yoshitsune and Trident. She becomes Kogarasumaru's trainer and extra member during Ikki's hospitalization period. During a match against another team, she fights Sleeping Forest's Water Queen, Om, and eventually overcomes her, with some help from Kazu. Recently, she is seen delivering Yoshitsune's bloodied \\"Rumble\\" Regalia to Kogarasumaru's headquarters with her right leg cut off. After completing this mission, she breaks down and cries. It is revealed she was the only survivor of the battle of Osaka in which Genesis exterminated Trident. Benkei actually cut her own leg off with a blade hidden within her Panther Corsa weapon to escape from the mecha that held her captive. She doesn't die from blood-loss since she's a proclaimed vegetarian. Nike is the current Gem King and the most powerful of Genesis' four Kings. He lives in America and leads two teams. \\"Nike\\" is just an alias and, in actuality, he is the real leader of Genesis, and the identical twin brother of Sora Takeuchi, with whom he also shares his real name. He is mentally unstable, and has a deep hatred for the one who took everything away from his brother, the former Gem King, Kilik. Prior to this, Nike was the weakest and most cowardly Gravity Child, but was forged by Sora into a sadistic killing machine for the sake of his plans. He is attracted to Simca (he even assaults her on one occasion) and is shown to be furious when Ikki asks her out on a date if he wins at the end of the Gram Scale Tournament. He also reveals (by mistake) to Rika that his cellphone has several perverted images of Simca. His Jade road is a combination of the Wing Road and the Gaia Road and allows him to nullify damage and strengthen his own body greatly. His Regalia can cause complete paralysis by sending vibrations that are completely opposite to one's own biorhythm through the ground. In recent chapters is it shown that Nike delivered the finishing blow to kill the leader of Trident, Yoshitsune. Nike is also seen holding Rika hostage in chapter 272 and in a flashback in 281 with shallot and Arthur and other gravity children. Nike was defeated by Kazu, armed with the Flame Regalia and his abilities as the new Flame King, during the raid on the battleship he and Sora had taken control of. Unable to handle his first ever loss, Nike mentally falls to pieces and becomes a vegetable. He is last seen in Simca's care, as she tries to undo what Sora did to him. Orca , whose real name is Vercingetorix, is a new member of Genesis who is a Gravity Child capable of using ATs underwater. He uses the Exploding Fang ability, which seems to be a fusion of Agito's Fang and Om's Bubblegum Crisis. He feels very alone on his road and seeks to find someone capable of defeating him. He eventually faces Agito and his other personality Lind, and he is eventually defeated. He seems relieved that he was finally defeated, and is later picked up by Genesis. He then faces Buccha in an underwater fight, and is defeated when Buccha slams him into the ocean floor. As he blacks out, he realized the reason that he lost twice was that he has always been alone and envies the fact that Issa has friends that he can rely on and fight for. He then joins Kogarasumaru and starts living at Issa's father's temple. As a Storm Rider, he is portrayed as a gigantic serpent- or dragon-like beast, similar to the Leviathan. Caesar is a new member of Genesis who utilizes \\"Legionarius Phalanx\\", a move that uses blindingly fast kicks to send out numerous powerful blasts. He manages to use it to send fear into Agito, although he is soon defeated by him (with support from Akito). He tried to use a tank-like mechanical exoskeleton against Agito but was easily subdued by Orca, who got impatient while waiting to fight Agito. As a Storm Rider, he is portrayed as a legion of robotic soldiers in phalanx formation. Tool Toul To is a team originally created to assist the kings with their Regalias. They are a completely neutral group and will assist any king regardless of which side they are on. Each king is assigned a tuner who becomes familiar with the king and acts as their personal tuner. Since the Regalia can be won from a king in battle, the new king would have trouble using the Regalia since the body structure of the old king might differ from the new one. That is where the members of Tool Toul To come in, as the new king will be assigned a tuner who will adjust the Regalia to the king's personal style and structure. Kururu Sumeragi Voiced by: Yukari Fukui (Japanese) is the leader of the current Tool Toul To and Pledge Queen. Initially, she was a new member keen on becoming Ikki's Tuner. Although shy around Ikki at first, she becomes devoted to him after witnessing his anger over Simca's attack. Kururu may be in love with Ikki as hinted in chapter 145. She does not wear ATs, but as the leader of Tool Toul To, she is a genius in repair, construction, and maintenance of ATs. In Ikki's battle with Ringo, Kururu identified the sound of Ikki's ATs, arrived at the battle in time to intercept Ikki as he was falling towards the river, and rebuilt his ruined ATs in midair in less than three seconds. She originally rebuilds the Wind Regalia for him, though it is stolen and given to Sora. She eventually becomes determined to create the new Storm Regalia for him. The Pledge Regalia allows her to utilize the bodies of other tuners through the 'Infinite Scale', enabling them to build, repair, and tune ATs as quickly as the Pledge Queen. In chapter 328 she reveals that she respects Ikki, but she doesn't want to be a part of his road because she wants to see the world with her eyes and so she can't be his link tuner. She created the Storm Regalia thanks to Ringo, Ikki's new link tuner. Ine Makigami is the first Pledge Queen of Tool Toul To and of the original Sleeping Forest. She is also knowledgeable in medicine and runs her own hospital. Though none of the Gravity Children require tuners, Spitfire still has a close relationship with her before his death. She decides to break the rule of neutrality of Tool Toul To (along with many of its other members) and help Kogarasumaru develop. She passes down her title of Pledge Queen to Kururu Sumeragi. Rune Rune is the second in command of Tool Toul To and the oldest member of the team. He contains various robotic parts and keeps weapons on him at all times. Rune is also a Gravity Child, which is revealed in chapter 149. Hako Isawa Hako is an ordinary member of Tool Toul To who originally wants to become Ikki's tuner to prove her ability. She steals the original Bagram Cores (part of the Wind Regalia) that were repaired by Kururu Sumeragi and replaces them with her own copy. She later attempts to seduce Ikki, thus becoming his tuner, but she is dismissed as being inferior to Kururu and Simca. She is eventually kidnapped and becomes Sora's tuner. She regains her ties with her team afterwards and comes to terms with herself and her own feelings of inferiority. Kanon Voiced by: Yuki Kaji (Japanese) is Ringo's Tuner and Kururu Sumeragi's cousin. He has an obsession for Ringo and seems to harbor romantic intentions, but some of his ambitions shatter when he openly plots to tamper with Ikki's ATs. He presses on in his disregard for Tool Toul To's neutrality by actively battling against Kogarasumaru, though he at least seems to respect their leader. Minor teams * The Skull Saders are a team of riders that employ unfair tactics and extreme numbers to attack their opponents. They are defeated and forced to disband by Ikki. They are led by Magaki, a man with a bald head with a tattoo which is shaped like a skull with a crown-like jaw. He vows revenge against Ikki, though he is soon beaten and arrested by Agito. **Magaki voiced by: Nobuyuki Hiyama (Japanese); Jason Douglas (English, Funimation) * The Rez Boa Dogs are led by Inuyama. They are forced into battle with Ikki due to interference by Simca. Inuyama is a close friend of Gonzo, and he wears a helmet shaped like the head of a Doberman dog. He slams his opponents with the tip of his helmet (or sometimes just with his impossibly hard hair), doing surprisingly major damage. His team is defeated and disbanded, and he continues to support Ikki afterward. Inuyama bears an almost identical appearance to Ryu from Shaman King. **Inuyama voiced by: Kazunari Tanaka (Japanese); John Gremillion (English, Funimation) * The Sabel Tigers are a team led by Natsumi Iriya. They take over the area around Ikki's school after the Night Kings are defeated and Kogarasumaru challenges them to obtain it. Natsumi attempts to use feminine charm in order to defeat Ikki, though he just ignores her. She develops a crush on him afterward. The team disbands and later reforms as the Pink Panthers. **Natsumi voiced by: Mayu Asada (Japanese); Alice Fulks (English, Funimation) * The Kintetsu Bulls are an A-class team that wishes to turn professional and serve as inspiration to AT riders around the world. They are led by Tokudawara Gonz≈ç, known as T-Gonz≈ç, who owns a clothing store. He constantly wears a set of heavy weights around his stomach to train himself. His entire team is defeated by Agito, but he is saved from death by Ikki. He supports Ikki and allows his team to have supplies from his store without charge. * Potemkin is a team consisting of octuplets. They apparently fight to protect the poor inhabitants of an abandoned ship from the government, but actually plan to make a lot of money from selling it. They don't wish to do anything else, so they avoid battles until Kogarasumaru wagers the Fang Regalia, which would make them a lot of money. They are defeated by Kogarasumaru while they are attempting to learn how that crushing the dreams of others is just another part of being a Storm Rider. * Animal House is a team whose members dress up as apes. They defeat the handicapped Kogarasumaru, and become well known because of it. Om later sneaks onto their team during a rematch and wipes out the members. Kogarasumaru, with Benkei in as a substitute, defeats Om and wins the battle. * The White Wolf Clan is a team consisting of elderly members of a company. The team was formed in order to save it from bankruptcy. The leader is Kururu's father, who challenges Kogarasumaru in order to use the teenagers for marketing. The team uses a highly sophisticated computer system and team of analysts in order to create the best tactics, though Kogarasumaru manages to overcome them. Kogarasumaru loses after Kururu and other members of Tool Toul To help the White Wolf Clan, as a means of giving Kogarasumaru a wake-up call to bring out its true power by teaching them how to lose honorably. The White Wolf Clan decides to destroy the deal they had and retire after winning. * Jiggy and Sleipnir are two A-class teams who recently joined forces to take on Kogarasumaru in the third round of the Gram Scale tournament. The former is a team specializing in D-Class matches, like Behemoth; the latter team is composed of 4 king-level Wing Road riders with a Norse mythology theme (hence their name). Originally, Kogarasumaru was slated to fight Jiggy alone, but Sleipnir, the favorite to win the tournament, intervened. All Sleipnir riders are \\"Wind road\\" riders and are all Brain chargers like Lind, but in the process they lost their original personalities. Other characters * Uncle Minami A man that made the , genetically modified children created to utilize ATs to their full potential. The Gravity Children are distinguished by cross- shaped marks on their pupils, and they are well adapted to the Zero Gravity inside the Trophaeum. After some of the originals, Falco, Black Burn, Spitfire, Dontores, Kilik, Simca, Sora, Nike, Rune, Om and Gabishi, escape from the laboratory where they were essentially created, another generation made out of Ringo, Ume, Mikan, Orca, and Nue appear. Ringo, Ume, and Mikan are given to Rika by Minami. He also leads the Brain Charger project, a less expensive alternative to the Gravity Children. It is a possibility that Ikki is a Gravity Child, as he was also given to Rika, when she was about 8, by Uncle Minami. You find out in chapter 295 that his name is Rinta Minami. He is killed by the Tower's elevator while trying to escape. * Kaito Wanijima Voiced by: Hikaru Midorikawa (Japanese); Illich Guardiola (English, Funimation) Known as the \\"Shinjuku Crocodile\\", he is Akito/Agito's older brother and the leader of the Windstorm G-Men, a special SWAT team that was created specifically for hunting down and arresting Storm Rider teams. They use special ATs that are hidden in their pant legs and form around their footwear. Kaito views his brother purely as a tool, constantly keeping him in a cage and punishing him with a bullwhip and a gun that fires rubber bullets. Lind Wanijima, the \\"original\\" personality of Akito and Agito's body, is frequently hinted to be very similar to Kaito. In chapters 290-291 it is suspected that he is Gazelle, but 292 reveals that Lind is actually Gazelle. And in chapter 300, be discovered that Kaito is Akito/Agito's father. * Voiced by: Noriko Shitaya (Japanese); Nancy Novotny (English, Funimation), Emily Woo-Zeller (English, Animax Asia) A teacher, called Tom-Tom or Ton-chan by her students, who frequently interacts with Kogarasumaru. She is constantly paranoid that she will be molested or raped by her students or other random people (though she doesn't seem as bothered by this as she ought to, sometimes). Despite this, she wears very revealing clothing and often performs perverted actions unknowingly. * Voiced by: Tomoyuki Dan (Japanese); David Wald (English, Funimation) The academic head of Higashi Junior High-school, who constantly tries to discipline Ikki and his team. He has a soft spot for Tomita Mari, one of his first students and currently his fellow teacher, and constantly encourages her to be stronger and more stern with her own students.

The family is small, with 11 species in 3 genera.Hidaka, K., Tsukamoto, Y. & Iwatsuki, Y.

Ichthyological Research, 64 (1): 45‚Äì53. Presently, the bonefishes are in their own order: Albuliformes . The families Halosauridae and Notacanthidae were previously classified in this order, but are now, according to FishBase, given their own order Notacanthiformes. The largest bonefish caught in the Western Hemisphere is a 16-pound, 3 ounce example caught off Islamorada, Florida, on March 19, 2007. Description Albula The bonefishes' closest relatives are the tarpons and ladyfishes in the order Elopiformes. Bonefishes are unlike tarpons in that their mouths are under the snout rather than the end of it. Like tarpons and ladyfishes, bonefishes can breathe air via a modified swim bladder and are found in brackish waters. Bonefish larvae are leptocephalic. The slender body of the bonefish is silver, with a blue to green tinted back. On the upper half of the body there are dark streaks with cross bands connecting to the lateral line. The body is rounded with a long, slightly downturned snout. The dorsal and caudal fins are black. Bonefish vary in adult length from 40‚Äì100 cm depending on species. The average size of a bonefish is from 3 to 5 pounds (1‚Äì2 kg) with the Florida record being 16 pounds 3 oz (7.34 kg). The bonefishes are brackish or saltwater fish typically living in estuaries and travelling out to sea to spawn on a lunar cycle. They feed in the shallow sand and mud flats, on benthic organisms, such as worms, mollusks, shrimp and crabs. They use their conical-shaped snouts to root out their prey and can often be seen with their tails out of the water. Bonefishes possess crushing teeth in their palates. Nemoossis and Pterothrissus These genera are similar to Albula, except they can be found in deeper waters.

He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples from 2011 to 2019. He is an expert in Chinese affairs and on the Middle East. Education and early diplomatic work Filoni was born in Manduria near Taranto, Italy. He entered the seminary and earned doctorates in Philosophy and in Canon Law from the Pontifical Lateran University. He was ordained a priest on 3 July 1970. He served in the Nunciatures of Sri Lanka from 1981 until 1983, Iran from 1983‚Äì1985, Brazil from 1989‚Äì1992 and the Philippines from 1992 until 2000. Although formally assigned to the Apostolic Nunciature to the Philippines, he was based in Hong Kong. During this time Archbishop Filoni was Pope John Paul II‚Äôs bridge to China's bishops, official and non-official Churches and bishops, in the hope of reconciling them to the Holy See. Apostolic Nuncio Pope John Paul II appointed Filoni as apostolic nuncio to Iraq and Jordan on 17 January 2001, naming him titular Archbishop of Volturnum. He received episcopal consecration from Pope John Paul II on 19 March 2001. He chose Lumen Gentium Christus as his episcopal motto. Archbishop Filoni defended the freedom of the Catholic Church in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein and ‚Äì in line with the Pope's position ‚Äì opposed the US invasion of the country in 2003. He remained in Baghdad as American bombs fell, which he called \\"nothing exceptional\\". When Mario Vargas Llosa visited him in Baghdad in 2003, he described Filoni as \\"small, astute, tough as nails, talkative and an expert on emergencies\\", who described sadly how, just as predicted, it was \\"incredibly difficult to administer the peace\\". After the fall of Saddam he recognized the new-found freedom enjoyed by the people, but he warned against the lack of security and the slow development of the economy. He expressed mixed feelings towards the new constitution, which he described as both a \\"positive step towards normalization in the country\\" and \\"contradictory in some areas\\", and supported the peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims. He came close to being killed in Baghdad on 1 February 2006, when a car bomb exploded next to the nunciature. He served in Iraq and Jordan until 25 February 2006 when he was named Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines. Roman Curia Substitute of the Secretariat of State Pope Benedict XVI appointed Archbishop Filoni Substitute for General Affairs on 9 June 2007, effective 1 July. During his four years as Substitute, it was Filoni's job to organise the activities of the Curia and the care of official translations of papal documents and correspondence; encryption dispatches messengers to be sent to the Registry of the papal letters, the resolution of legal issues, personnel management in the Curia and nunciatures, protocol and etiquette for visiting heads of state, information and media management, and Vatican archive management. He was also responsible for organizing the activities of nuncios around the world in their activities concerning the local churches. Observers noted that during his time as substitute, Filoni never established a strong rapport with his immediate superior, Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone. In 2008, Archbishop Filoni was awarded the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. McCarrick Scandal In his August 2018 ‚ÄúTestimony,‚Äù Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤ reported that on 25 May 2008 he had sent Filoni a summary of information provided by an ex-priest named Gregory Littleton who attested to sexual abuse of priests and seminarians by Cardinal Theodore McCarrick along with the information included in Richard Sipe's recently published ‚ÄúStatement for Pope Benedict XVI‚Äù on McCarrick‚Äôs sexual misconduct. He said that Filoni ‚Äúknew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.‚Äù Filoni received checks totalling $3,500 from McCarrick between 2008 and 2013.

La Nazione remarked that to be reassigned after only four years as Substitute was unusual and speculated that Filoni had been moved because of a \\"stormy\\" relationship with Bertone. The Holy See announced on 6 January 2012 that he would be created a cardinal on 18 February. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of . On 24 April 2012 Filoni was made a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Congregation for the Oriental Churches, and the Congregation for Catholic Education.

He maintained his innocence, and there was considerable controversy about the case. Supporters said that his conviction was based largely on circumstantial evidence. Felker's defense filed numerous appeals after his trial. Lower courts upheld his conviction, including the US Appeals Court of the 11th Circuit in May 1996. The US Supreme Court denied certiorari in 1985 and 1996. Felker's appeal in May 1996 to the US Supreme Court was considered a test of the new Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), which had been signed in April 1996. Using a key provision of the law, the US Supreme Court rejected his petition for habeas corpus in June 1996 by saying that he had not established new evidence to be considered in his second habeas corpus appeal. Given outstanding issues, four media sources petitioned the Georgia court in 2000 for DNA testing of Felker against evidence recovered from Ludlam's body. Felker is notable as the first subject in the United States for which the court agreed to post-conviction DNA testing of an executed person. Such testing was done in 2000 under an agreement in which four media sources paid for the testing and collaborated on distribution of the news of results. The results were ruled inconclusive.Maria Gold and Michael D. Shear, \\"DNA Tests Confirm Guilt of Executed Man\\", Washington Post, 12 January 2006; Quote: \\"The testing in Coleman's case marks only the second time nationwide that DNA tests have been performed after an execution. In 2000, tests ordered by a Georgia judge in the case of Ellis W. Felker, who was executed in 1996, were inconclusive.\\"; accessed 26 May 2017 History Ellis Wayne Felker was born in Georgia in 1948. He attended local schools. In 1977, he was convicted for aggravated sodomy and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment but was paroled after four.Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 655 (1996) In 1981 he was operating a leather store. In 1981, a 19-year-old Georgia woman, Evelyn Joy Ludlam, disappeared in Warner Robins, Georgia. She was working her way through Macon Junior College (now part of Middle Georgia State University) as a cocktail waitress at a motel in Warner Robins. Her car was found abandoned in that town. Police learned from her landlady that Ludlam had left a note saying that she would be meeting with Felker later on the day that she had last been seen. According to the police, Felker invited Ludlam to meet with him, under the pretense of a job at his leather shop. Joy Ludlam hoped to change jobs because serving as a cocktail waitress did not agree with her religious beliefs. Felker was put under police surveillance for two weeks. Meanwhile, Ludlam's body was found in a creek. She had been raped and murdered by asphyxiation, or strangling. Trial and controversy An autopsy performed for the police initially determined that Ludlam had been dead for five days when found. That finding would eliminate Felker as a suspect because of the police surveillance of him. However, the medical examiner, Dr Whitaker, later testified at trial and changed the state's findings of time of death. He said that the air temperature, the state of decomposition of the body, the fact that Ludlam had been found wearing the same clothes as when she had last been seen, and the fact that missing and murdered persons are frequently killed soon after they disappear all led him to conclude that Ludlam had died two weeks before her body was found. (That was before Felker was under surveillance.) The prosecution based its case largely on circumstantial evidence pointing to Felker having met with Ludlam. They said that the case was similar to the sexual crime for which Felker had been convicted in 1977. The strongest physical evidence was hair found on Ludlam's clothes. The State Crime Laboratory said it might have been Felker's, according to microscopic examination of Felker's hair. Similarly, the state held that hair found at Felker's house matched Ludlam's, as did hair in his car. (However, that highly-subjective test of microscopic examination of hair is no longer considered scientifically reliable. Improvements in forensic testing have led most states other than Georgia to drop the use of such hair evidence, in favor of DNA analysis.) The defense conducted an independent assessment of the autopsy evidence and report and introduced it at the trial. Its expert concluded that Ludlam had died three days before the body was found. That would have eliminated Felker as a suspect. He maintained his innocence for the rest of his life. After a five-day trial, the Houston County, Georgia jury convicted Felker in 1983 of the rape, murder, aggravated sodomy, and false imprisonment of Ludlam. Given the aggravated circumstances of the crimes, Felker was sentenced to death. Felker's defense filed numerous appeal petitions during the following years. Appeals and execution Felker's defense mounted several appeals on his behalf. It failed in its appeal for certiorari review by the US Supreme Court after the Georgia Supreme Court had upheld his conviction in 1984. He appealed for collateral relief, which was denied by a state trial court: \\"the Georgia Supreme Court declined to issue a certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial.\\" The US Supreme Court again denied certiorari, in Felker v. Zant, 502 U.S. 1064 (1992). The defense filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in US District Court on several grounds, including that the state had illegally withheld exculpatory evidence. The District Court denied the petition, a ruling upheld in 1995 by the US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh CircuitFelker v. Thomas (1995), US Court of Appeals 11th Circuit, FindLaw; accessed 26 May 2017, and the US Supreme Court denied certiorari on the decision in 1996. Felker was originally scheduled to be executed in May 1996. That month, he filed a request for a stay of execution and permission to file a second habeas corpus petition under a new law. A stay was granted while the case proceeded, as the lower courts denied the petition.Felker v. Thomas (11th Circuit, 1996); accessed 26 May 2017 The US Supreme Court heard his habeas corpus appeal, as a test of the new Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), enacted on April 24, 1996.Felker v. Turpin, Warden (1996), U.S. Supreme Court, Legal Information Institute, Cornell University; accessed 26 May 2017 \\"The act cracked down on Death Row inmates and other state prisoners who file numerous appeals in federal court after losing initial appeals. In June, the court upheld a key part of the law and rejected Felker's appeal.\\"Tribune News Service, \\"Figure In Death Row Test Case Executed For '81 Rape-murder\\", Chicago Tribune, 17 November 1996; accessed 26 May 2017 The US Supreme Court held that Felker's petitions for habeas corpus did not satisfy \\"the requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act, let alone the requirement that there be \\"exceptional circumstances' justifying the issuance of the writ.\\" It dismissed the petition for writ of certiorari \\"for want of jurisdiction.\\" The petition for an original writ of habeas corpus was denied, as the court said that there was not enough new evidence. Felker's attorneys continued to work on his behalf. In 1995 and 1996, they had filed requests under Georgia's Open Records Act to review materials held by the District Attorney, and their representative was given a chance to review the records and copy certain portions. After filing in September 1996 for a writ of mandamus with the Georgia Supreme Court, Felker's attorneys received a total of four new boxes of evidence, which the prosecution had recently found in a storage room. In September 1996, Felker was granted a 40-day stay of execution so that a court could determine if government officials had violated the state open records law in denying him access to records on his case. In late September, the Superior Court in Perry ruled that the government officials had complied sufficiently with Felker's open records request, and \\"in late October, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the ruling.\\" It said that Felker had failed to take advantage of the earlier period to prepare for a hearing and review materials. It also held that \\"a custodian of public records complies with an ORA request when he grants reasonable access to the files in his custody.\\" The prosecutor was not required to have his office find all relevant documents.Felker v. Lukemire, 477 S.E.2d 23 (1996), 267 Ga. 296; accessed 26 May 2017 Felker was executed on November 15, 1996 at the age of 48. He was electrocuted in Georgia's electric chair at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center in Jackson, Georgia. The previous night, Larry Grant Lonchar had been executed for three murders. Felker had gained permission from Lonchar and the authorities to videotape Lonchar's execution to prove that use of the electric chair constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The next execution to be videotaped was that of Andrew Grant DeYoung on July 21, 2011. Post-execution DNA testing and exoneration attempt In July 2000, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Boston Globe, Macon Globe, and CBS News announced that they would pay for DNA testing in the Felker case to try to determine if he was innocent.\\"Media To Pay For Dna Tests On Executed Man\\", Chicago Tribune, 27 July 2000; accessed 26 May 2017 The Chicago Tribune had run a series on inequities in application of the death penalty in Illinois. Concerned that several convicted men had been exonerated, Illinois Governor George Ryan declared a moratorium on executions in the state in 2000 and said that there appeared to be too many inequities in how the penalty was sentenced and administered. A Middle Georgia judge, Houston County Senior Superior Court Judge L.A. McConnell, ordered evidence in Felker's case to be made available for DNA testing, saying that it was part of the public record. That is believed to be the first time in the United States that a court agreed to post-conviction DNA testing of a person who had been executed after being convicted of rape and murder. By an unusual arrangement, several news sources agreed to pay for the testing and how they would publicize the results.Rhonda Cook, \\"DNA testing ordered in case of man already executed\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 2000; posted at Truth in Justice website; accessed 26 May 2017 The results were ruled as inconclusive. The court ruled that the finding alone would not have been enough to grant a new trial to Felker or to result in his exoneration and release.

In 1942, as part of Army Group Center's 3rd Panzer Army, the LVI Panzer Corps was used to fight Soviet partisans on the Eastern Front. The corps was active in the Spas- Demensk and Kirov area before withdrawing to Krichev and across the Dnieper. In the Spring of 1944, the LVI Panzer Corps fought at Zhlobin and Kalinkovichi in Belarus. From June 22 to August 19, during Operation Bagration, the Soviets destroyed Army Group Center and swept the Germans from Belarus. The corps withdrew through the Pripet Marshes towards Brest-Litovsk. From 13 July to 29 July, as part of the 4th Panzer Army, the LVI Panzer Corps was involved in the unsuccessful German defense against the Soviet Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive. The corps continued to withdraw through Poland and into Germany as the Soviet advance continued. In 1945, the LVI Panzer Corps became part of Army Group Vistula's 9th Army. From 16 April to 19 April, at the Battle of Seelow Heights, the corps suffered heavy losses along with the rest of the 9th Army. The remnants of the LVI Panzer Corps ended the war defending the Nazi capital in the Battle of Berlin.

She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the third child of the coke and steel magnate Henry Clay Frick (1849-1919) and Adelaide Howard Childs (1859-1931). Two of her siblings did not reach adulthood, and her father played favorites with his two surviving children, Childs Frick (1883-1965) and Helen. After the reading of their father's will, which favored Helen, the brother and sister were estranged for the rest of their lives. Nonetheless, Helen developed as a strong, independent and spirited young woman. She was equally interested in art history and philanthropy, making a catalogue of her father's art collection as a young woman, a collection which became the Frick Collection in New York. Her interest in the history of art resulted in her establishing the Frick Art Reference Library, which was originally housed in the bowling alley of the Frick family mansion in New York City at 1 East 70th Street. In 1924, a separate two and one-half story building was constructed at 6 East 71st Street to house the library, which was replaced in 1935 by the present thirteen story building at 10 East 71st Street.Knox, Katharine McCook (1979).

She also established an art library at the University of Pittsburgh and, later in her life, built the Frick Art Museum on the grounds of Clayton to house her private art collection. Early life: Pittsburgh and New York Helen's father was chairman of the Carnegie Steel Company, a partner in business with Andrew Carnegie; together the two men founded United States Steel Corporation. Helen's early life was shaped by her father's wealth and reputation as a ruthless industrialist and union strikebreaker, and especially by the attempt on his life by Alexander Berkman, after the Homestead Strike of 1892. The strike lasted 60 days, resulted in 10 deaths and 60 wounded ‚Äì the Pinkertons had been brought in to quell the strike ‚Äì and only ended when the National Guard were sent in by the order of Pennsylvania's governor. Frick's actions were seen as heroic by men such as Andrew Mellon and J. P. Morgan but earned him a reputation as an enemy of the working class, and he became known as \\"Frick, the strike breaker\\". Two days after a July 23, 1892 assassination attempt, Frick's newborn son died.Lockhard (1997), 10 Clayton, the Frick family Pittsburgh mansion A year earlier his first-born daughter, Martha, died ‚Äì from swallowing a pin while on a trip in Europe ‚Äì after an excruciatingly painful illness that lasted several years.

She grew up in Pittsburgh on the family's estate, Clayton, where she was educated by a Swiss governess. As a child she showed an interest in her father's art collection, going so far as advising and giving opinions about various paintings.Lifson (2012), 22 In the 1890s, after the Homestead Strike, Carnegie and Frick became bitter enemies over control of Carnegie's holdings. At the end of the 1890s Carnegie moved to New York, and Frick moved his family there a few years later, in 1905. He leased the Vanderbilt house at 640 5th Avenue, bought the old Lenox Library and began building the Henry Clay Frick House on 5th Avenue, on which he spent about $5 million. He employed a 27-member staff to cater to himself, his wife, and Helen.\\"Carnegie vs. Frick: Dueling Egos on Fifth Avenue\\". New York Times. April 2, 2000.

By age 17, she had been to Europe nine times, visiting the Louvre, Uffizi, Prado, Pinakothek, the National Gallery, as well as visiting churches and cathedrals. Additionally, she gained access to private collections with her father on buying expeditions. It was during these trips that she became interested in art archives, spending time in the archives at London's Record Office and in Paris' Musee des Archives. In 1908, she went with her family to Europe where they visited London, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona and Florence. In Paris, Helen, her father and brother visited Alphonse James de Rothschild's widow, the Baroness Rothschild, whose art collection was reputedly the most important in Europe. Helen's father bought two El Grecos on Helen's advice.Sanger (2007), 68 Helen Frick and her father, portrait by Edmund Charles Tarbell, c. 1910 Back in New York, she established a home for women textile workers in Wenham, Massachusetts. On a visit to Boston's North Shore, she had become aware of the life of shoe-workers in Lynn, Massachusetts, and in the textile mills farther north, and upon her return from Europe she asked her father to purchase a home to provide the women with the opportunity to rest and recuperate.Sanger (2007), 69‚Äì70 The home became known as the \\"Iron Rail Vacation Home for Working Girls\\".\\"Helen Clay Frick Dies at 96\\".

The relationship may have begun as early as 1913, but the two kept it quiet, although they were seen together in public on occasion. St. John apparently adored Helen and she seemed to be in love with him, and an engagement announcement between the two had been expected before his departure. Why he left for Europe without following through on his promise to marry Helen is unknown, but was perhaps because Helen's brother told St. John that Frick would never sanction a marriage between the two.Sanger (2007), 102-103 Helen decided to join the war effort: she applied for and received permission to establish a Frick unit under the Red Cross. With four other women, Helen left for France in November 1917, arriving in Paris in December where she went to work immediately helping to wrap 150,000 Christmas packages being sent to soldiers at the front. After Christmas she arrived in Bourg-en-Bresse where her unit worked with refugee women and children. Eventually she would become responsible for refugees in 70 villages, and she asked her father for funds to build an orphanage.Sanger (2007), 105-111 During that trip she witnessed the destruction of art works and churches. She chose never to marry and, on her father's death in 1919, when she was 31, she inherited $38 million,\\"Helen Clay Frick Left Estate Worth More Than $15 Million\\". New York Times.

Her mother and older brother, Childs Frick, received considerably less, which would cause ongoing tension and conflict for Helen in future years. In the meantime, she bought a farm in Bedford Village, New York, and joined the exclusively male board of the Frick collection.Sanger (2007), 126-128 Art archives and Frick Collection  She devoted her adult life to defending her father's public image from attack and continuing his tradition of philanthropy. The Frick Collection in New York was founded from Frick's personal art collection, as established in his will. Helen became trustee for the Frick Collection and was heavily involved in early acquisitions. Before Frick's death, by the time she was 25, she had embarked on a project of cataloguing the family's private collections, photographing the art work and collecting provenance data. After his death, she devoted ten years to learning about museum management and preparing to turn the Frick residence into the Frick Collection.Sanger (2007), 132 In 1920, she went back to Europe, revisiting sites she had known before the war, taking pictures and documenting the damage. In northern France, traveling through Berry-au-Bac and on to Soissons, she was appalled at the destruction, particularly to Soissons Cathedral. She photographed the damage, accumulating a record of the devastation wrought during the war. It was on that trip that she came to blame the Germans for damaging sites she had visited before the war, an attitude that would strengthen throughout her life.

In London Robert Witt (who went on to found the Courtauld Institute of Art) showed her the Library of Reproductions for the National Gallery, which held 150,000 photographs, spanning six centuries. Entranced with his archiving model, Helen asked whether she could copy it. He told her she could and that he would help. Upon her return to New York began assembling an archive of 13,000 records, beginning with the Frick family collection of catalogs, postcards and photographs, mounting each reproduction and labeling it with information about artist, provenance, exhibition histories for future reference. She went on to hire agents in Europe to buy catalogues and she hired a professional photographer to begin photographing art in the US and in Europe, in \\"the days when one could almost buy some works of art for the cost of making photographs of them.\\" She converted the mansion's basement bowling alley to store the collection, and despite its location it soon gained a reputation among art historians.Lifson (2012), 23 Eventually the references were moved to New York where the Frick Art Reference Library opened in 1924, in a single story building on E. 71st Street.\\"A Memorial Built by a Daughter for her Father\\".

The institution was deeply in debt and had cut fine arts courses, but the acquisition of land in Oakland that previously belonged to the Frick estate provided space in Oakland for expansion. Bowman wanted to build a \\"cathedral of light\\" there; Helen funded the university's fine arts department with the proviso of \\"having the final selection of the department head.\\"Sanger (2007), 154 She went on to endow and found the University's teaching collection in 1928, and continued to give Bowman funds to pay workers to complete what eventually came to be called the Cathedral of Learning.Sanger (2007), 187 Early in the 1930s, after the 1931 death of her mother, she hired John Russell Pope to expand of the Frick Reference Library into two adjacent townhouses. Pope built abundant shelving and windows, and a medieval-style office for Helen. Time magazine said of the building, it was \\"instantly recognized at one of the most important art libraries in the world.\\" It would grow into a records library with over 300,000 books and exhibition catalogues, extensive auction and provenance records, and 1.2 million images of art from the 4th to the 20th centuries; it contains the only records for many pieces of art lost or destroyed during both World Wars.Lifson (2012), 21 Between 1922 and 1967, Helen commissioned 57,000 large format negatives. In Italy church interiors were lit, making it possible to photograph centuries-old frescoes and altarpieces, such as the now-lost frescoes by Giovanni Baronzio. More than 8,000 photographs are attributed to Italian photographer Mario Sansoni, who worked for Helen for many years. Henry Clay Frick House, now the site of the Frick Collection The family's home on 5th Avenue was transformed into the Frick Collection in 1935. Helen continued as a trustee, to be active in acquisitions. A small woman, described as a \\"frail little woman,\\" Helen was often in conflict with the male board members, in particular with John D. Rockefeller, whom her father had also appointed as trustee to the Frick Collection. The two fought over the manner in which the house should be transformed into a museum, whether the costly furniture should be kept (she wanted it, he did not), and Helen resisted his efforts to add pieces from his own collection. She eventually resigned the position in 1961, \\"in a fury,\\" after yet another fight with the Rockefellers. Worried at the outbreak of World War II and reminded of the devastation she witnessed during World War I, in 1941 Helen had every single record in the art archives microfilmed, which were stored, at first, in an underground bank vault, and later moved to the Midwest. As early as 1943, the Committee for the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas was consulting with the library, compiling lists for the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program, which located, identified and returned looted art at the end of World War II. Return to Pittsburgh and later years In the early 1960s she funded the building of the Frick Fine Arts Building to house the fine arts department at the University of Pittsburgh. She was reticent about her involvement with the project and refused, at first, to have her name associated with it. Eventually she allowed a Pittsburgh reporter to interview her, revealing she was the building's donor.Sanger (2007), 277-278 A dispute eventually severed the relationship with the university, involving the employment of Germans ‚Äì Helen's World War I experience instilled an intense dislike of Germans she never overcame ‚Äì in addition to the university's acquisition of modern art, which she equally disliked. In 1970 she built the Frick Art Museum on the grounds of Clayton to house her personal art collection. Notoriously reclusive during her last years, she died at her Clayton home in Pittsburgh at age 96 on November 9, 1984, leaving a personal estate estimated to be worth $15 million. She is buried alongside her parents in the Frick family plot at Homewood Cemetery. Much of her later life was spent in Pittsburgh, at Clayton, where she kept a permanent staff. Clayton's second floor contains personal family archives spanning almost a century, which proved to be useful to architects, when after Helen's death the house underwent a full restoration to its original state before opening to the public as a museum.\\"Restoring Baronial Slendor in Pittsburgh\\".

Abercrombie (1969) reminds us that we rarely reflect upon our initial judgements, which are embedded in our own personality. Abercrombie found that group discussion helped these students solve such problems and, in particular, improved the ability of the students to discriminate between facts and opinions, to resist false conclusions and to bring fresh strategies to their attempts to solve new problems without being adversely influenced by past failure. The ideas put forward by Jane Abercrombie about the development of small group interactive learning pedagogies in the 1960s in the UK had an almost immediate impact on the primary and tertiary education sectors there. Her Anatomy of Judgement: an investigation into the process of perception and reasoning culminated ten years of research on the selection and training of medical students at University College London. This research suggested that the art of medical judgement, diagnosis and other key elements of medical practice, were better learned in small groups of students arriving at a diagnosis collaboratively than by students working individually. Her finding is that group discussion, properly directed, can do much to eliminate faults in the teacher and to make the student think instead of learning. Research and education There was a clear line of development in her work that was always underpinned by her interest in educational work. She progressively developed her research and thinking from her early years as a zoology teacher through her growing involvement in Group Analysis and its application in education. Throughout her work, three themes ‚Äì the selective and projective nature of perception and reasoning; the difficulty that human beings experience in changing; the subtlety and complexity of communication ‚Äì continually interact with and enrich one another. She increasingly concentrated on group analysis and its relevance to and use in higher education involving \\"free\\" or \\"associative\\" group discussion as she used it in her own work with students. Group learning She carried out pioneer research into the use of groups in learning with medical, architectural and education students, and she shared with diverse audiences in many countries her extensive knowledge and expertise as a teacher who used the methods and principles of group analytic psychotherapy. Jane Abercrombie came to these views through her contact with the psychoanalyst and group analyst S. H. Foulkes and in 1952 she became a founder member of the Group Analytic Society, and president of the society in 1981. This society still awards a prize in her name, the Abercrombie Prize, in recognition of the importance of her ideas. The Anatomy of Judgement Her best known publication, \\"The Anatomy of Judgement\\" was reissued in 1989 (Free Association Books). This book brings together an edited selection from her educational writings. It is essentially an analysis of the process of learning as a summation of judgements when information is presented. The author shows how emotion and preconceptions influence this judgement. The extracts are arranged in four parts. The first gives an overview of her educational convictions, of the development of her research and thinking from her early years as a zoology teacher and of her growing involvement in group analysis and its application in education. The second illustrates the way in which, throughout her work, three themes ‚Äì the selective and projective nature of perception and reasoning; the difficulty that human beings experience in changing; the subtlety and complexity of communication ‚Äì continually interact with and enrich one another. The third part focuses in greater detail upon group analysis, its relevance to and use in higher education.

Early life Franz Xaver Kraus was born in Trier in 1840. He completed his studies in the Trier gymnasium, began his theology in 1858-60 in the seminary there, and finished it in 1862-64, having passed in France the time from the autumn of 1860 to the spring of 1862 as tutor in distinguished French families. He was ordained a priest by auxiliary bishop Matthias Eberhard of Trier, 23 March 1864. Even after he became a priest, he continued his studies in theology and philology at the universities of T√ºbingen, Freiburg ‚Äî where he had received the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1862, and received that of Doctor of Divinity in 1865 ‚Äî and Bonn. In the autumn of 1865 he became beneficiary of Pfalzel near Trier, where he developed a zealous literary activity, interrupted by several journeys of the purpose of study to Paris, Belgium, and to Rome in January 1870. In the spring of 1872 he was attached to the faculty of philosophy at the university of Strasburg as professor extraordinary of the history of Christian art, and in the autumn of 1878 he succeeded Johann Alzog as Professor ordinary of Church history at Freiburg. In 1890 he was made grand- ducal privy councillor, and held the office of pro-rector of the university for the period 1890-1. He was also curator of religious antiquities in the Grand Duchy of Baden, and from 1883 a member of the Baden Historical Commission. Gravesite of Kraus at the Hauptfriedhof Freiburg Views He was a man of deep religious feeling and Catholic faith, but, from association with the Liberal Catholics in France, Italy, and Germany, he became imbued with their views on ecclesiastical polity. He also felt a deep reverence for the religious personality of the later Cardinal John Henry Newman, whom he visited at Birmingham. At the time of the Vatican Council, he entered into close connections with the opposition party, and kept up these relations for some time. He remained in the Church, but the strife had engendered in his mind a certain bitterness. In many anonymous or pseudonymous articles written for the Liberal press, he gave vent to his dissatisfaction with certain ecclesiastical conditions. The \\"Kirchenpolitische Briefe\\" in the \\"Beilage zur Allgemeinen Zeitung\\" (1895-9), written under the pseudonym of \\"Spectator\\", created a great sensation. It is to him that we owe the distinction between \\"religious and political Catholicism\\", a formula in which he imagined he had found the solution of many difficulties. He died at San Remo in 1901. Works Kraus was a man of brilliant and versatile talents, a scholar of great learning, a clever and elegant writer, and, in spite of ill-health and the acute bodily sufferings of his closing years, an author of wonderful productivity, who delighted in his work. After a few translations from the French (van Hemen, de Ravignan, and Lacordaire) he began his independent literary career with small works on the history of early Christian literature in the first centuries and the Middle Ages, among them: \\"√Ügidius von Rom\\" (in \\"Oesterreichische Vierteljahreschrift f√ºr kath. Theologie\\", I, 1862) \\"Observationes criticae in Synesii Cyrenaei epistulas\\" (Sulzbach, 1863); \\"Studien uber Synesios von Kyrene\\" (in \\"Theologische Quartalschrift, XLVII, 1865; \\"Der Briefwechsel Pauli mit Seneca\\" \\"Theologische Quartalschrift\\", XLIX, 1867), and later \\"Ueber das Martyrium des h. Ignatius von Antiochien\\" (\\"Theol. Quartalschrift\\", LV, 1873). Of the edition of the \\"Opera omnia\\" of Thomas √† Kempis, undertaken by Kraus, only the first volume appeared (\\"Opuscula\\", Trier, 1868). Another series of writings, published in the \\"Bonner Jahrb√ºcher des Vereins von Alterthumsfreunden\\" and in the \\"Serapeum\\", deals with particular features of the history and archeology of Trier. Franz Xaver Kraus. Relief portrait by Joseph von Kopf (1827-1903)In this manner Kraus was led on to the study of Christian archaeology in general, and then to Christian art in all its aspects, thus reaching the field of research for which he seemed particularly qualified, and in which he was to accomplish his best work. Among other larger or smaller publications we may mention: \\"Beitr√§ge zur Trierischen Archaeologie und Geschichte. I, Der heilige Nagel in der Domkirche zu Trier\\" (Trier, 1868); \\"Die Kunst bei den alten Christen\\" (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1868); \\"Die christliche Kunst in ihren fr√ºhesten Anfangen. Mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der neuesten Resultate der Katakomben-Forsehung popul√§r dargestellt\\" (Leipzig, 1872); \\"Ueber den gegenw√§rtigen Stand der Frage nach dem Inhalte und der Bedeutung der r√∂mischen Blutampullen \\"(Freiburg, 1872); \\"Das Spottcrucifix vom Palatin\\" (Freiburg, 1872); \\"Roma sotterranea: Die r√∂mischen Katakomben. Eine Darstellung der neuesten Forschungen, mit Zugrundelegung des Werkes von J. Spencer Northcote und W. R.

Akademische Antrittsrede\\" (Freiburg, 1879); \\"Synchronistische Tabellen zur christlichen Kunstgeschichte\\" (Freiburg, 1880). These were followed by the works which constitute Kraus's chief claim to fame: \\"Kunst und Alterthum in Elsass-Lothringen. Beschreibende Statistik im Auftrage des kalserlichen Oberpr√§sidiums von Elsass-Lothringen herausgegeben\\" (4 vols, Strasburg, 1876‚Äì92); \\"Real-Encyklopaedie der christlichen Alterth√ºmer\\" (2 vols., Freiburg, 1882-6); \\"Die Kunstdenkm√§ler des Grossherzogthums Baden\\" (vols. I ‚Äî VI, 1, Freiburg, 1887-1904 ‚Äî continued by other authors); \\"Die christlichen Inschriften der Rheinlande\\" (2 vols, Freiburg, 1890-4); and lastly his masterpiece: Geschichte der christlichen Kunst\\" (vol. I and the first half of volume II (Freiburg, 1896‚Äì1900). The second half of volume two, which brings the description of the Italian Renaissance to a close, was published by Joseph Sauer in 1908. This work combined the results of all Kraus's labours in the field of art. Its chief merit lies in the description of the connection of art with the general and religious culture of the different periods. Other important publications belong to the special history of art: \\"Die Wandgem√§lde der St. Georgskirche zu Oberzell auf der Reichenau\\" (Freiburg, 1884); \\"Die Miniaturen des Codex Egberti in der Stadtbibliothek zu Trier\\" (Freiburg, 1884); \\"Die Miniaturen der Manesseschen Liederhandschrift\\" (Strasburg, 1887); \\"Die mittelalterlichen Wandgem√§lde im Grossherzogthum Baden\\" (with H. von Oechelh√§user, vol. I, Darmstadt, 1893); \\"Die Wandgem√§lde der Sylvesterkapelle zu Goldbach am Bodense\\" (Munich, 1902). Kraus's literary leanings were directed especially towards Italy. After a close study of Dante, covering years of labour, he published \\"Dante. Sein Leben und sein Werk. Sein Verh√§ltniss zur Kunst und Politik\\" (Berlin, 1897). Somewhat earlier he had published \\"Luca Signorelli's Ilustrationen zu Dante's Divina Commedia\\" (Freiburg, 1892). His collected \\"Essays\\" belong to Kraus's most brilliant literary efforts (vols. I and II, Berlin, 1896 and 1901); they are of a literary, historical, and political character, and the majority appeared originally in the Deutsche Rundschau; particularly noteworthy are the essays \\"Antonio Rosmini\\" ‚Äî for whom Kraus had a particular veneration ‚Äî and \\"Francesco Petrarca in seinem Briefwechsel\\". Compared with literature and art, Kraus's work on church history takes second place. His \\"Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte fur Studierende\\" (lst ed. in 3 parts, Trier, 1872-5; 4th ed., 1896, French translation: \\"Histoire de l'Eglise par F. X. Kraus traduite par P. Godet et C. Verschaffel\\" (4 vols. Paris, 1891-2) contains much that is excellent, but has also serious defects. It is distinguished by clear and perspicuous arrangement, based more or less on that of the well-known manual of the Protestant historian Kurtz, and its narrative. One misses the objectivity of the historian, the author showing in many instances the influence which his liberalizing views exerted over his judgment. At the second edition of 1882, Kraus was compelled by the pope to withdraw and revise it. The revised edition appeared in 1887 with the ecclesiastical imprimatur. The first edition of the church history was followed by the \\"Synchronistische Tabellen zur Kirchengeschichte\\" (Trier, 1876) and \\"Charakterbilder aus der christlichen Kirchengeschichte\\" (5 parts, Trier, 1877), which were designated the fourth and fifth divisions of the ecclesiastical history, but had really the character of separate works. Among his less important ecclesiastico- historical works are \\"Briefe Benedicts XIV. an den Canonicus Francesco Peggi in Bologna 1727-1758\\" (Freiburg and T√ºbingen, 1884; 2nd ed., 1888): \\"Medicean Rome\\" in Cambridge Modern History, II (Cambridge, 1903), 1-35. Mention should also be made of his preparation of the tenth edition of Alzog's \\"Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte\\" (2 vols., Mainz, 1882), and his \\"Ged√§chtnissrede auf Johannes Alzog, Professor der Theologie an der Universitat Freiburg\\" (Freiburg, 1879). His political rather than his ecclesiastical views are reflected in \\"Die Erhebung Italiens im 19. Jahrhundert: Cavour\\" (Mainz, 1902 ‚Äî \\"Weltgeschichte in Karakterbildern\\", vol. V). Recent research Recent research has problematized Kraus' characterization as a \\"Liberal Catholic\\". Some have stressed the social conservatism of Kraus, who was highly critical of modern mass mobilization by democratic parties, especially by the Catholic Centre Party in Baden. On the other hand, it has become much clearer how strongly Kraus (who was portrayed as \\"Prof. Dane\\" in Fogazzaro's Il Santo) was already involved in the European and North American networks of \\"Americanism\\" and \\"Modernism.\\" References Bibliography   *Braig, Carl.

Despite not having any major deals or any big kind of trade, the representatives of both nations have called for expanding economic relations between the two countries. History Many Iranians migrated to Bengal throughout history in search of employment as well as to propagate Islam. The first two Iranians, Baba Kotwal Isfahani and Qazi Ruknuddin Samarkandi, migrated from the Khwarazmian Empire in 1204, arriving to Bengal as acquaintances of the Turco-Persian military ruler Bakhtiyar Khalji during his conquest of the region, briefly unifying Iran and Bangladesh under Iranian Ghurid rule until the Khwarazmians took control over Iran. The Bengal Sultanate was a stronghold for Iranian and Turkic immigrants. With Persian as an official language, Bengal witnessed an influx of Persian scholars, lawyers, teachers and clerics. During the reign of Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, Sonargaon became an important centre of Persian literature, with many publications of prose and poetry. Described as the \\"golden age of Persian literature in Bengal\\", its stature is illustrated by the Sultan's correspondence with Persian poet Hafez. When the Sultan invited Hafez to complete an incomplete ghazal by the ruler, the poet responded by acknowledging the grandeur of the Sultan's court and the literary quality of Bengali-Persian poetry. Emperor Shah Rukh of Persia had diplomatic relations with the Sultan of Bengal Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. Emperor Shah Rukh contributed to ending the 5-year long Bengal Sultanate‚ÄìJaunpur Sultanate War after pressuring the Sultan of Jaunpur Ibrahim Shah to abstain from attacking Bengal \\"or to take the consequence upon himself. To which the intimation of the Jaunpur ruler was obedient, and desisted from his attacks upon Bengal\\". Sakhi Salamat of Isfahan, the founder of the aristocratic Prithimpassa Family, migrated from the Timurid Empire in 1499. In 1950, the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, first visited East Bengal where he stayed for four days at the palace of the Prithimpasha Nawab family and went wildlife hunting in the Estate forests. Liberation War During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, Iran stood with West Pakistan politically and diplomatically. Iran was concerned with the imminent break-up of Pakistan which, it feared, would have caused the state to fractionalise into small pieces, ultimately resulting in Iran's encirclement by rivals. President Nixon of the United States encouraged Iran to send military supplies to Pakistan. At the beginning of the conflict, Iran had helped West Pakistan by sheltering the PAF's fighter jets and providing it with free fuel to take part in the conflict, in an attempt to keep Pakistan's regional integrity united. After many of the PAF jets being defeated, the PAF aircraft that survived decided to take refuge at Iranian air bases, refusing to continue fighting.Why the Indian Air Force has a high crash rate When Pakistan called for unilateral ceasefire and the surrender was announced, the Shah of Iran hastily responded by preparing the Iranian military to come up with contingency plans to forcefully invade Pakistan and annex its Balochistan province into its side of Balochistan, by any means necessary, before anybody else did it. The United States also sent military supplies to West Pakistan and routed them through Iran.Shalom, Stephen R., The Men Behind Yahya in the Indo-Pak War of 1971  Modern relations  With the fall of the Shah in 1979, new dimensions were added to the relationship between the newly proclaimed Islamic Republic of Iran and Bangladesh. Relations gradually grew further with President Hashemi Rafsanjani becoming the first Iranian leader to visit independent Bangladesh in 1995. Subsequently, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina also visited Iran and held talks with President Mohammed Khatami. Iran assisted Bangladesh with relief package after the cyclone Sidr hit Bangladesh in 2007. The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sought to deepen ties between the two states, with Iranian investment in Bangladeshi industry. Bangladesh has also supported Iran's nuclear program, saying it is for peaceful purposes. Bangladesh and Iran signed a preferential trade accord in July 2006 which removed non-tariff barriers, with a view to eventually establishing a free trade agreement. Before the signing of the accord, bilateral trade between the countries amounted to US$100 million annually. In mid-2007, the Bangladeshi government requested Iran's help in the construction of a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh, in order to offset the decline in the availability of gas for power generation. Bangladeshi Minister of Power, Energy and Natural Resources also requested Iranian assistance for the construction of new oil refineries in Bangladesh.Bangladesh Seeks Iran's Cooperation In Nuclear Energy Sector Trade Relations  Bangladesh and Iran signed an MoU on signing a bilateral trade agreement at the meeting held in 20 February 2001. Besides, there is a preferential trade agreement signed in 2006 between the two countries which has remained not functional for last nine years. The proposed joint council deal is expected to increase Bangladesh's export to Iran as the latter has good demand of jute and jute goods. ‚ÄúBangladesh government also plans to provide some trade facilities to exporters to Iran. The issue will be discussed with the Iranian authorities,‚Äù said an official. Of the MoUs, an MoU will be signed on the import of wheat from Iran, officials said. An MoU on agriculture sector signed at the 2013 meeting will be extended till 2020. About the PTA, officials said the countries have failed to settle dispute of rules of origin of products in last nine years of signing of the agreement, which has kept it non-functional. Meanwhile, Iran asked Bangladesh to regularly pay installments of a loan taken from the country in the 1980s. An ERD letter sent to foreign affairs ministry recently cited the development. Bangladesh took the loan to construct Ashuganj Fertiliser and Chemical Company Ltd, but later faced problems in continuing the repayment of installments after the sanction was imposed on Iran in 2006. Terrorism  Bangladesh and Iran have discussed possible cooperation in the area of fighting against extremism. ‚ÄúWe discussed the possibility of common joint cooperation on extremism and we will look into the exact details of how we can do that,‚Äù visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Javed Zarif said at a press briefing at Hotel Sonargaon yesterday. He came to Dhaka Tuesday night to explain the nuclear solution it had with the Western World. He left the city yesterday. He had official talks with his Bangladesh counterpart AH Mahmood Ali and courtesy call on President Abdul Hamid and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The Red Devils recorded 22 tracks with Mick Jagger in June 1992, again produced by Rubin, though the tracks were not issued at the time (they have since cropped up on various bootlegs, and one track was officially released on a Jagger compilation on Rhino Records in 2007). The band also backed the actor and sometime musician Bruce Willis, when the action star performed at his Planet Hollywood clubs. The Devils also backed Johnny Cash on music that was not released until after the country singer's death, on the boxed set Unearthed. Butler also played on Rancid's 1998 album Life Won't Wait. After the breakup of The Red Devils, Butler also fronted the band, '13', releasing one self-titled record on Hightone Records in 1997. The original members of '13' included Kid Ramos on guitar, James Intveld on bass, and Johnny Morgan on drums. The recorded release of '13' on Hightone Records was produced by Warren Croyle and features Stephen Hodges and Johnny Morgan on drums, Tom Leavey and James Moore on bass, Andy Kaulkin on keyboards, with Alex Schultz, Smokey Hormel, Paul Bryant, and Doug Hamlin on guitar. Butler achieved his greatest fame in Europe, especially the Netherlands, where the 'Lester Butler Tribute Band' still performs. Butler died of an overdose of heroin and cocaine on May 9, 1998, in Los Angeles at the age of 38. Two of his friends, who were involved in his overdose, were convicted of involuntary manslaughter.

He is a full professor at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg where he heads the Laboratory for Autonomous Intelligent Systems. He is known for his substantial contributions to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem as well as diverse other contributions to robotics. Biography Education Wolfram Burgard received his Diploma degree from University of Dortmund in 1987 and his Doctorate from the University of Bonn in 1991. His thesis advisor was Armin B. Cremers. Career In 1991 he became a research assistant at the University of Bonn, where he led the laboratory for Autonomous Mobile Systems. He was head of the research group which installed the mobile robot Rhino as the first interactive museum tour-guide robot in the Deutsches Museum Bonn, Germany in 1997. In 1998, he and his colleagues deployed the mobile robot Minerva in the National Museum of American History in Washington DC. In 1999, Wolfram Burgard became Professor for Autonomous Intelligent Systems at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg. Research Together with his colleagues, Wolfram Burgard developed numerous probabilistic approaches to mobile robot navigation. This includes Markov localization, a probabilistic approach to mobile localization which can robustly track the position of a mobile robot, estimate its global position when it starts without any prior knowledge about it, and can even recover from localization failures. In 1999, Frank Dellaert, Dieter Fox, Sebastian Thrun, and Wolfram Burgard developed Monte Carlo localization, a probabilistic approach to mobile robot localization that is based on particle filters. Wolfram Burgard and his group has also made substantial contributions to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, which is to determine the map of the environment and the position of the robot at the same time. Wolfram Burgard together with his long-term collaborators Dieter Fox and Sebastian Thrun is a co-author of the book Probabilistic Robotics. He also is a co-author of the book Principles of Robot Motion - Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations, together with Howie Choset, Kevin M. Lynch, Seth A. Hutchinson, George Kantor, Lydia E. Kavraki and Sebastian Thrun. Wolfram Burgard has the 2009 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, the most prestigious German research prize. He has furthermore received seven best paper awards from outstanding conferences. He also became a distinguished lecturer of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. In 2008, Wolfram Burgard became a fellow of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence. In 2009, Wolfram Burgard became fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. In 2010, he received an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council. Students Wolfram Burgard supervised several PhD students in his lab for Autonomous Intelligent Systems, namely Maren Bennewitz (2004), Dirk Haehnel (2005), Cyrill Stachniss (2006), Rudolph Triebel (2007), √ìscar Mart√≠nez Mozos (2008), Patrick Pfaff (2008), and Christian Plagemann (2008), J√ºrgen Sturm (2011), Daniel Meyer-Delius Di Vasto (2011), Slawomir Grzonka (2011), Thilo Grundmann (2012), Kai Wurm (2012), Axel Rottmann (2012), Barbara Frank (2013), Rainer K√ºmmerle (2013), Bastian Steder (2013), J√∂rg M√ºller (2013), Dominik Joho (2013), Boris Lau (2013), Maximilian Beinhofer (2014).

It had a top speed of .Secondhand Buying Guide: Honda CM125C/200T/250T (Motor Cycle News 9/01/91) The CM125C engine combines the single carburettor of the squat Honda CD125 Benly motor with the tall cylinder head and five-speed, gearbox of the sportier Honda 125 Super Dream. Description The design used popular North American cruiser styling and copied features found on larger displacement cruisers and factory custom-styling. The CM125 had high handlebars, megaphone silencers, a teardrop-shaped petrol tank and a stepped seat. More chromium-plated and polished alloy parts were found on this model than on the comparable Superdream and Benly 125 models. The quality of the chrome-plated finish was such that corrosion was a problem. The ignition lock was between the instrumentation, which consisted of two binnacles, one containing a speedometer; the other, a set of three warning lights (neutral, turn, high beam). The ignition key also activated both the steering lock and the lock on the plastic tool box located under the off-side side panel. The drum brakes were actuated by a cable in front and a rod in the rear. The engine had a duplex camchain rather than the more common inverted-tooth type. Frame numbers started JC05-50 for the 1982-5 CM125CC and JC05-51 for the 1985-6 CM125CF. The appearance of this model, greatly enhanced by its substantial-looking twin cylinder engine, meant it enjoyed particular popularity in the United Kingdom, where learner motorcyclists are by law restricted to machines of 125 cc and below until they pass their riding test and obtain a full licence. The CM125 Custom was deleted from Honda's United Kingdom line-up in 1986. It continued to be manufactured and sold in Europe and Singapore as the CM125CN (1992, frame numbers (JC05) 5500023-5505185), CM125CP (1993, frame numbers (JC05) 5600001-5608387), CM125CR (1994-1998, frame numbers (JC05) 5700001-5999999) and CM125CX (1999, frame numbers (JH2JC05A*/JH2JC05B*) XK000001-XK099999). Its continuing popularity eventually led to another 125cc custom model being introduced, the Honda CA125 Rebel.

He died in 1999 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.Brompton Cemetery: List of notable occupants From his student days at the London School of Oriental and African Studies, the Muslim world was his driving intellectual interest. An expert on Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Central Asia, and a commentator for the BBC World Service for more than twenty years, Anthony was a linguist, historian, bibliophile, art lover and traveller. His early work was on the development of Pan-Islamism in early 20th century India, out of which grew a lifelong interest in Pakistan and the wider Islamic world. A student of Persian, he followed Afghan and Iranian politics closely. In 1982, soon after Afghanistan took centre stage in global politics, his standard work, Afghanistan under Soviet Domination, was first published. His understanding that the Afghan resistance's struggle against the Soviet Union during the Soviet-Afghan War would throw up challenges to traditional Afghan society and produce its own process of radicalisation was well ahead of its time, as were his fears for the disintegration of Afghan unity under pressure from tribalism and sectarianism. In later years, he was particularly critical of the Taliban and of what he saw as their narrow vision of Afghanistan‚Äôs future. In the early 1980s, he was also secretary of the Afghanistan Support Committee and worked with the Afghan Refugee Network and with Amnesty International. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Hyman became absorbed with Central Asia, travelling there, learning Russian, acquainting himself with the politics and cultures of the new states and introducing these countries to a wider audience through his writings. As with Afghanistan, he advocated a higher-profile European interest in these countries and their needs. He was a founding director of the charity Links, which worked to resolve conflict and promoted democracy in the region in the early years of transition. He was at various times a research associate of the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House, a senior fellow of the McArthur Foundation in New York and a visiting fellow of Queen Elizabeth House at Oxford University. He was also associate editor of the journal Central Asian Survey. A Memorial Lecture was set up at SOAS, University of London in 2002 and has run annually since that time. Its aim is to encourage discussion and debate about Afghanistan and its neighbours.

Arthur H. Clarke Co. 1933. Background Following the Council House Fight of 1840 a group of Comanches led by the Penateka Comanche War Chief Buffalo Hump, warriors from his own band plus allies from various other Comanche bands, raided from West Texas all the way to the coast and the sea. These Comanches were angered by the events of the Council House, in which Texans had killed the Comanche Chiefs when the Texans had raised a white flag of truce. The Council House Fight The Texan officials began the treaty talks with demands that were unacceptable or impossible to fulfill for the Comanches, such as the Comanche return all white captives, including the famous captive Cynthia Parker. Other white captives were with bands of the Comanche not represented at the talks. As a show of good faith the Comanche chiefs brought in two captives, a Mexican boy and an adolescent girl named Matilda Lockhart. The Texans thought they were going against their word, because the Comanche chiefs did not return all of the white captives and figured they held back some of their white captives to guarantee their own safety. Exercising a premeditated plan of violating the immunity of the peace delegation, the Texas militiamen told the chiefs it was they that would indeed be held hostage to guarantee the release of their other white captives. Everyone panicked and drew their weapons. The militia began firing and the entire Comanche peace delegation was killed.The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains. Oklahoma Press. 1952. The Great Raid of 1840 But Buffalo Hump was determined to do more than merely complain about what the Comanches viewed as a bitter betrayal. Spreading word to the other bands of Comanches that he was raiding the white settlements in revenge, Buffalo Hump led the Great Raid of 1840. On this raid the Comanches went all the way from beyond the Edwards Plateau in West Texas to the cities of Victoria and Linnville on the Texas coast. In what may have been the largest organized raid by the Comanches to that point on Texas settlements, or an attack by Indians on any white city in the continental United States,The Comanches: Lords of the Southern Plains. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. they raided and burned these towns, plundering at will. Linnville was the second largest port in Texas at that time. On the way back from the sea the Comanches were confronted by Texas rangers and militia in a fight called the Battle of Plum Creek (near the modern town of Lockhart). The Battle of Plum Creek The \\"battle\\" was really more of a running gun fight, as the Comanche War Party was trying to get back to the Llano Estacado with a huge herd of horses and mules they had stolen, a large number of firearms, and other plunder such as mirrors, liquor, and cloth. Volunteers from Gonzales under Mathew Caldwell and from Bastrop under Ed Burleson gathered to intercept the Comanches. Joined by Ranger companies and armed settlers hastily assembled as militia from central and east Texas, they confronted the Indians at Good's Crossing on Plum Creek, near the modern town of Lockhart (about 27 miles south of Austin). Texas history says the Texans won this battle, although the Indians got away with most of their plunder and a great many of the stolen horses and mules. \\"Several hundred head of horses and mules were recaptured, as were also immense quantities of dry goods.\\" The Texans reported killing 80 Comanches in the fight, yet recovered only 12 Native American bodies. Apparently greed largely determined the battle's outcome. The Comanches would have never been caught had they not been herding such an enormous number of stolen and heavily laden mules and horses. Thomas J. Pilgrim took part in the Battle of Plum Creek.Thomas Jefferson Pilgrim - Sons of Dewitt Colony TexasBattle of Plum Creek - TSHA Online Aftermath Buffalo Hump continued to raid white settlements until 1856, when he led his band into the Brazos River Reservation. The town of Linnville never recovered from the Great Raid, most of its residents moving to Port Lavaca, the new settlement established on the bay three and one half miles southwest by displaced Linnville residents.

Their music contained many American political anti- authoritarian themes. Band history The concept behind The Dream Is Dead began in 2000 when Clark Giles (founder of Happy Couples Never Last Records) and long-time friend Jason McCash (bass player for the seminal Circle City hardcore band Burn It Down) kicked around the idea of doing a project band dedicated to putting the threat and politics back into hardcore. A feeling of youthful rebellion and resistance to the status quo initially drew them to hardcore punk in their teenage years, and it was the integrity of the music that sustained their love for the genre. Initial attempts to get the band off the ground failed but the breakup of Burn It Down left McCash without a band and revitalized The Dream Is Dead's prospects. Jared Southwick (from Indiana death metal band Harakiri) was recruited for guitar duties, eventually parting from his former band to devote his time fully to The Dream is Dead. Alex Bond, fresh from the breakup of his screamo band The Sutek Conspiracy, completed the lineup on drums in September 2001. Alex Bond left the band late in the Spring of 2002 and was replaced by local drummer Dustin Boltjes. By August, Boltjes was acclimated, and the band resumed a heavy regimen of touring. The toll of being on the road and family responsibilities led founding member McCash to bow out in the fall of 2003. Beaten but not broken, the band resurfaced in early 2004 with former Ice Nine guitarist Dave Lawson on bass. The bulk of 2004 was spent writing the band's first album, once again for Escape Artist. A short tour with fellow hoosiers Phoenix Bodies in late 2004 allowed them to polish the new material. In the meantime, in-demand Los Angeles producer and current Theory of Ruin guitarist Alex Newport (formerly of Fudge Tunnel and Nailbomb) was recruited to handle recording and production duties for the album. Having recorded several current indie staples for the likes of the Melvins, the Locust, Mars Volta, and others, the band and the label felt he was the man for the job. A short tour brought The Dream Is Dead to the west coast in March 2005, where they recorded their debut album, Hail The New Pawn. In June 2007, the band announced it would be releasing a split 7\\" on Relapse Records with The Gates of Slumber.

Reid vies with Ninian Finlay for the title of the youngest player ever to be capped for - he was seventeen years and thirty six days old when he was capped against on 19 February 1881; however, Reid had lived through an extra leap year day, when he was capped in 1881, so Finlay generally gets that title.Bath, p65 He played at second row/lock.Bath, p137 Reid attended Edinburgh Academy, which he was attending when capped. On his second cap, against , he actually played against Frank Wright who was also seventeen at the time, but was a boarder from Manchester.Bath, p99 He later played for Edinburgh Academicals RFC. As Allan Massie says, :\\"Charles Reid's physique would never have appeared inadequate for any forward position; he was bigger than 's Tom Reid who was the biggest and heaviest forward the British Lions took to South Africa in 1955, and more or less the same height and weight as the great Willie John McBride.\\"Massie, p9 Reid was 15 to 16 stone in weight, and 6 ft 3in.Massie, p7 The first historian of Scottish rugby, R.J. Phillips says that Reid \\"carried no superfluous weight and was as active as a well-trained ten-stone man\\", but that also, from his viewpoint in the 1920s, he was \\"Scotland's greatest forward.\\"Massie, p8 He played alongside some of the greats of the era including Ninian Finlay, Andrew Don Wauchope and Bill Maclagan. He was said to be a proficient tackler, excellent at dribbling and Scotland only lost four times in his twenty one caps. He captained Scotland in 1887 to their first Home Championship win, and also won scored tries. He maintained an interest in rugby long after retiring from the game, and after the positional changes in the early 1890s, he wrote boldly: :\\"Give me a forward team like we had in Manchester in 1882, and I don't care how many threequarter backs you have; we could go through them. We dribbled very close, and backed up the other so well that they could not get away, and they had fliers like Bolton against us. Dribbling and tackling are the characteristics of the Scottish forwards, and on them we depend to win.\\"Quoted in Massie, p10 However, Massie disagrees with this statement, and says that over-dependence on aggressive forward play such as that supported by Reid led to European sides being beaten thoroughly by and when they toured.Massie, p11 Personal life In the match against in 1881, he played against his classmate Frank Wright at Raeburn Place. At the end of the match, both of the boys were carried on the shoulders of their fans back to the school. He was the brother of James Reid, who was capped five times for Scotland from 1871-75, including the very first rugby international.Massie, p6 He was a doctor by profession, and later ended up living in Selkirk.Massie, p13 Nickname His nickname \\"Hippo\\" does not refer to his being like a hippopotamus, but the fact that he didn't know the word for a horse, when asked once in an Ancient Greek class at the Edinburgh Academy.Bath, p101 References * Bath, Richard (ed.)

In prehistoric art, finger flutings are lines that fingers leave on a soft surface. Considered a form of cave painting, they occur in caves throughout southern Australia, New Guinea, and southwestern Europe, and were presumably made over a considerable time span including some or all of the Upper Paleolithic.Sharpe, K. & Van Gelder, L. 2006. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295. Most are not obvious figures or symbols but, rather, appear to many observers as enigmatic lines. They are also called trac√©s digitaux or finger tracings and (though these terms are also in part interpretative) meanders, macaroni, and serpentines. The term finger fluting was coined by Robert Bednarik. Generally they are made in a substance called moonmilk. Sometimes they are made through a thin clay film into moonmilk underneath or perhaps just into clay. As Henri Breuil has published, finger flutings have been recognized since the early days of the 20th century in Europe as Paleolithic. Their recognition as having a similar antiquity outside of Europe lay chiefly in the hands of Sandor (Alexander) Gallus and then in Koonalda Cave in Australia. Many other sites both in Europe and Australia have been found, some of the more famous being GargasSharpe, K. & Van Gelder, L. 2010. Fluted Animals in the Zone of Crevices, Gargas Cave, France. Proceedings of the Eleventh Congress of the International Federation of Rock Art Organizations, Lisbon, Portugal, 4‚Äì9 September 2006. and Baume Latronne caves in France and the cave of Altamira in Spain. Study methods Bednarik continues to publish sites that contain flutings, but current forward research into finger flutings is mainly being carried out by Kevin J. Sharpe and Leslie Van Gelder.Sharpe, K. & Van Gelder, L. 2006b. The study of finger flutings. Cambridge Archaeological Journal 16:3, 281-295. They have developed the following methods for this purpose. Their cornerstones include multiple examinations of the flutings under investigation, experimentation, and the initial and primarily setting aside of questions of meaning (as such assumptions can determine what investigators then see in the flutings). The physical data in the flutings themselves comprise what they seek: how the fluters constructed their flutings, how the flutings functioned with respect to one other and, if possible, how the flutings functioned for the fluters. Sharpe and Van Gelder use a specific terminology for their studies and call upon three analyses. Terminology A fluter makes a fluting by sweeping their fingers across a soft surface; a unit comprises flutings drawn with one sweep of one hand or finger; the profile of a unit or a fluter comprises the silhouette of the finger tops left in the medium from the fluting; a cluster comprises an isolatable group of units that exhibit a unity, for instance because they overlay each other; and a panel comprises a collection of clusters that appears geographically or otherwise distant from other clusters or on a surface of reasonably uniform orientation. Internal analysis In terms of the field methodology, having become familiar with a cluster, an Internal Analysis of it is carried out, specially noting the directions of the flutings and their overlays. This provides the differentiation of clusters and units, and the temporal sequence of the flutings. The analysis relates to Alexander Marshack‚Äôs question, asked especially for engraved line markings: What do the order, direction of and (especially for engravings) the tools for creation of the lines tell about the mind of the artifact creator when creating? Though Marshack pioneered this technique, it has been modified in its application by others such as Bednarik, Francesco d‚ÄôErrico, and Michel Lorblanchet. It forms the backbone of research into line markings such as flutings. Forensic analysis One of their additions to this methodological base, Sharpe and Van Gelder call a ‚ÄòForensic Analysis.‚Äô In this, they record where possible whether the left or right hand made the unit under examination, as indicated by the presence of marks that the first or fifth finger ‚Äì written F1 or F5 ‚Äì would make. These appear distinctively different from one another and from the marks of the other fingers. They measure the width of the F2-F4 set of marks at their narrowest, calling this the 3-fingered width of the unit. The width data for the three fingers suggest the age category of the fluter, namely whether a young child or older. A Forensic Analysis also examines the profile of a 4- or 5-fingered unit, for frequently units start with the tops of fingers and the investigator needs at least four fingers to tell whether the hand is left or right. Then the investigator records the relative height of F2 to F4 against F3. This would suggest the gender of the fluter painter. Further, consistency of widths and profiles, and perhaps some other features among units suggest the same person painted them with the finger-fluting technique. Results of studies Flutings on the ceiling of the Zone of Crevices, Gargas Cave, France. Part of a panel.

Interpretations The lack of thorough studies, let alone methods for doing them, means speculation as to the meaning of flutings runs unchecked, even by the most well-known experts on prehistoric art. They are seen, for example, as representing such things as the first scribbles by humans, though intuitive and random but serpentines (Breuil); water related (Marshack); entopic shapes or phosphenes (Bednarik); huts, comets, or rivers, or linear-phallic and male symbols in the statistical placement of signs within a cave (Leroi-Gourhan); snakes (and thereby associated with death) (Barri√®re); psycho-neurological archetypes (Gallus); hunting marks (Barri√®re); shamanic ritual (Lewis-Williams). The corpus of Paleolithic flutings is too complex to fit into a single meaning paradigm. Too much in prehistoric ‚Äòart‚Äô does not conform to what modern people might see as figures and symbols, flutings offering an example. Investigators bring to their study and tie their methods to preconceived notions as to what is meaningful, what constitutes a pattern, and what they think is the origin of fluting making. No one now may ever know the meaning of the flutings and no one now should expect to know it. That need not stop people responsibly offering meaning or intentionality hypotheses, Sharpe and Van Gelder state. But all such hypotheses must subject themselves to the data uncovered by investigations using methods such as those above. Tracings of hands and finger flutings often show the dimensions of children.Bower, B. (2007). Children of Prehistory, Science News vol. 171, pp. 264-266.

He is known for his Conceptual Art, environmental installations, Land Art, Postminimalist torn paper works, epistemic abstraction, deconstructed canvas works, and large-scale map paintings. Early life and education Neustein was born in Danzig (present day Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). As refugees, his family immigrated to the USSR, Austria, and finally settled in Brooklyn in the early 1950s. After studying history at CCNY, and painting under Willem de Kooning at the Pratt Institute in New York City, Neustein immigrated to Jerusalem in 1964. Work alt=Neustein has a diverse artistic practice that includes painting, drawings and works on paper, large- scale installation, film and video, performance, and monumental land art works. Neustein's work is held in numerous public institutional collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Morgan Library, the Israel Museum, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Tel Aviv Museum, Albright Knox Gallery, and others. In recent years, Neustein's work has been included in several group exhibitions at museums and galleries, including the Nasher Sculpture Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Haus Der Kunst, Munich, and David Zwirner Gallery. Art historians Robert Pincus-Witten, Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, and Arthur Danto, as well as philosophers Hilary Putnam and Martin Jay, have written extensively about Neustein's work. Between 1964 and 1998, Neustein was represented by Bertha Urdang Gallery in New York and Jerusalem. In 1979, Neustein had a solo exhibition at Mary Boone Gallery in which he showed reconstructed canvases. Between 1973-77, Neustein showed at the Yodfat Gallery and Naomi Givon Gallery, in Tel Aviv.  Early career  Neustein began to show regularly in Israel and the UK, starting his \\"Carbon Copy Drawing\\" series in 1970 by \\"marking\\" carbon paper stationary with cuts, tears, and folds. However, it was his 1971 Jerusalem River Project (made in collaboration with Gerry Marx and Georgette Batlle) -- a site-specific \\"sound sculpture\\" action in which loudspeakers installed across a desert valley played the looped recorded sound of a river‚Äîthat earned him more widespread recognition. Photo documentation of the piece was shown at the Israel Museum, Yvon Lambert Gallery, Paris, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, MAK Vienna, and MACBA. Curator Yonah Fischer supported Neustein's work, including him in several exhibitions at the Israel Museum such as Concept Plus Information, and assisting in the realization and display of The Jerusalem River Project. During the same period, Neustein started to build an oeuvre of large torn paper works that received critical attention.  Mature work   Drawing, Installation, Territorial Imperative  In the same period, Neustein began an extensive and innovative drawing practice that continues today, amassing a large body of work that grew to include torn and folded works on paper, erasure drawings, magnetic \\"drawings\\", and the Carbon Paper or Carbon Copy Drawing series, in which formerly standard carbon copy paper is torn, folded, pressed, and scraped. Neustein participated in the landmark Beyond Drawing show at the Israel Museum in 1974, curated by Yona Fischer and Meira Perry Lehmann. In 1977, the Tel Aviv Museum mounted a ten-year retrospective of Neustein's works on paper, curated by Sarah Breitberg. In 1992, the Albright Knox mounted a solo show of Carbon Copy Drawings which travelled to the Grey Art Gallery at NYU. A solo show of his \\"magnetic drawings\\" were shown at Wynn Kramarsky Gallery in 1998. Alongside his studio practice, Neustein has mounted large-scale installations throughout his career that often included quotidian objects such as hay bales, boots, pinecones, and rainwater, as well as monumental land art works. Neustein was among the first artists to introduce environmental and installation art into the Israeli art scene. Notable examples include Still Life, 1983, in which the life-size silhouette of an Israeli war plane was singed into the turf on the Israel- Lebanon border with burning tires. In 1976, Neustein enacted Territorial Imperative, in which the artist documented a dog marking his territory along the Israeli-Syrian border in the Golan Heights, identifying spots the dog had marked with posters and maps. Neustein repeated the action in Belfast, Northern Ireland between the Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods (1977); in Krus√•, Denmark, at the German/Danish border (1978); and near Kassel, Germany, along the East and West German border, as a participant in Documenta 6 (1977). Over curator Manfred Schneckenburger's objections, Neustein's work was \\"withdrawn\\" from Documenta, after the German government advised the artist that his piece caused \\"consternation among specialists\\" about what they described as the \\"complicated relationship between West Berlin and the German Democratic Republic.\\"  Painting, Five Ash Cities and Venice Biennale  In the mid-1980s, Neustein produced maps painted on canvas and cardboard, or etched into rusted metal. In the 1990s, Neustein returned to large-scale installation, with a series of environmental works he called the Five Ash Cities. He worked closely with Wendy Shafir, who was alternately his dealer, curator, and collaborator. The Ash Cities were immersive, room-sized relief maps of cities, constructed out of packed ashes that rested on the floor of the exhibition space. They often included crystal chandeliers installed to hang low to the ground, so they nearly touched the ash-covered floor. Ash Cities were realized at Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art, North Carolina; the Ujazd√≥w Castle, Warsaw; moCa, Cleveland, curated by Jill Snyder; Bilder Sind Verboten at Martin Gropius-bau, Berlin, curated by Eckhart Gillen and Amnon Barzel; and the Herzliya Museum, curated by Wendy Shafir. In 1990, another chandelier work, How History Became Geography was exhibited at the Barbican Centre, London. Documentation was later shown by the Israel Museum. How History Became Geography Joshua Neustein In 1995, Neustein was selected to represent Israel in the Venice Biennale. For The Possessed Library, curated by Gideon Ofrat, Neustein had two large cranes parked nearby the Israeli Pavilion, the facade of which he surrounded with construction scaffolding. Plexiglas panels etched with book titles lined the scaffolding, resembling books on shelves, while bubble wrap sacks hung suspended from the cranes, one just above the pavilion's roof, the other dipping in through a skylight in \\"The Tosca Room\\". \\"The Tosca Room\\" walls were covered in soot, while its floors were strewn with terra-cotta letters under plexiglass. A soundtrack played a whistled version of the \\"E Lucevan Le Stelle\\" aria from Tosca. Neustein later used recycled components from the Biennale in The Blind Library (1998) at Bet Ariella Library. In 1996, Neustein's work was included in the Arturo Schwarz Collection exhibition at the Israel Museum. In 1998, several of Neustein's environmental works were exhibited in Out of Actions, curated by Paul Shimmel at LA MOCA, and traveling to MAK Vienna, Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona, Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo, Japan.  2000s and 2010s  During the early- and mid-2000s, Neustein had significant participations in exhibitions at the Palazzo Delle Arti Napoli, the Haifa Museum of Art, the Time Depot, and the Chelsea Art Museum. During this time, Neustein permanently installed a life-size bronze cast of a tree with terra-cotta colored letters climbing its trunk in the lobby of the JCC in Manhattan. In 2010, the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto commissioned Margins, an installation that included a chandelier embedded in the wall alongside texts screened onto the wall and plexiglass sheets, referring to the writings of Edmond Jab√®s. In 2012, Neustein mounted a large-scale retrospective at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, titled Drawing in the Margins, which included 67 works spanning 40 years. The exhibition was curated by Meira Perry Lehmann. Neustein mounted Boss, a solo exhibition at Untitled gallery on New York's Lower East Side, the same year. In the past decade, Neustein has participated in numerous group exhibitions at museums and galleries, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Paper Trails, a historic show of works on paper curated by Marla Prather in 2011), the Nasher Sculpture Center, LA MOCA (the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles), the Haus Der Kunst, Munich, and David Zwirner Gallery. For LA MOCA, Neustein reenacted Road Piece (1971) as part of \\"Ends of the Earth\\", an exhibition on Land Art curated by Philipp Kaiser and art historian Miwon Kwon. The show travelled to the Haus Der Kunst with director and curator Okwui Enwezor.

Elderkin, \\"The Bee of Artemis\\", The American Journal of Philology, 60:2 (1939), 213. 200px Frankish mythology comprises the mythology of the Germanic tribal confederation of the Franks, from its roots in polytheistic Germanic paganism through the inclusion of Greco-Roman components in the Early Middle Ages. This mythology flourished among the Franks until the conversion of the Merovingian king Clovis I to Nicene Christianity (c. 500), though there were many Frankish Christians before that. After that, their paganism was gradually replaced by the process of Christianisation, but there were still pagans in the Frankish heartland of Toxandria in the late 7th century. Pre-Christian traditions The majority of pagan Frankish beliefs may share similarities with that of other Germanic peoples. If so, then it may be possible to reconstruct the basic elements of Frankish traditional religion.Fabbro, p. 5. The migration era religion of the Franks likely shared many of its characteristics with the other varieties of Germanic paganism, such as placing altars in forest glens, on hilltops, or beside lakes and rivers, and consecration of woods.Perry, p. 22. Generally, Germanic gods were associated with local cult centres and their sacred character and power were associated with specific regions, outside of which they were neither worshipped nor feared.Schutz, 153. Other deities were known and feared and shared by cultures and tribes, although in different names and variations. Of the latter, the Franks may have had one omnipotent god Allfadir (\\"All Father\\"), thought to have lived in a sacred grove. Germanic peoples may have gathered where they believed him to live, and sacrificed a human life to him.Perry, p. 22-23, paraphrasing Tacitus. Variants of the phrase All Father (like Allfadir) usually refer to Wuotan (Woden, √ì√∞inn/Odin), and the Franks probably believed in Wuoton as \\"chief\\" of blessings, whom the first historian Tacitus called \\"Mercurius\\", and his consort Freia,Perry, p. 23. as well as Donar (Thor), god of thunder, and Zio (Tyr), whom Tacitus called \\"Mars\\". According to Herbert Schutz, most of their gods were \\"worldly\\", possessing form and having concrete relation to earthly objects, in contradistinction to the transcendent God of Christianity. Tacitus also mentioned a goddess Nerthus being worshipped by the Germanic people, in whom Perry thinks the Franks may have shared a belief.Perry, p. 24. With the Germanic groups along the North Sea the Franks shared a special dedication to the worship of Yngvi, synonym to Freyr, whose cult can still be discerned in the time of Clovis.Fabbro, p.17 In contrast to many other Germanic tribes, no Merovingians claimed to be descended from Wodan.J.M. Wallace-Hadrill - Early Germanic Kingship in England and on the Continent. London, Oxford University Press.1971, p. 18. Some rich Frankish graves were surrounded by horse burials, such as Childeric's grave.  Symbolism of cattle  The bulls that pulled the cart were taken as special animals, and according to Salian law the theft of those animals would impose a high sanction. Eduardo Fabbro has speculated that the Germanic goddess Nerthus (who rode in a chariot drawn by cows) mentioned by Tacitus, was the origin of the Merovingian conception of Merovech, after whom their dynasty would be named. The Merovingian kings riding through the country on an oxcart could then be an imaginative reenactment the blessing journey of their divine ancestor.Fabbro, p. 16 In the grave of Childeric I (died 481) was found the head of a bull, craftily made out of gold. This may have represented the symbol of a very old fertility ritual,Fabbro, p.14 that centred on the worship of the cow. According to Fabbro, the Frankish pantheon expressed a variation of the Germanic structure that was especially devoted to fertility gods. However, a more likely explanation is that the Merovingian ox-cart went back to the Late-Roman tradition of governors riding through the province to dispense justice in the company of angariae, or ox wagons belonging to the imperial post. Alexander Callander Murray, 'Post vocantur Merohingii: Fredegar, Merovech, and \\"sacred kingship\\", in: idem ed., After Rome's Fall: Narrators and Sources of early medieval history. Essays presented to Walter Goffart (Toronto 1998) p.125 The bull in Childeric's grave was probably an insignificant object imported from elsewhere, and belongs to a wide artistic usage of bulls in pre-historic European art. Foundation myth The Frankish mythology that has survived in primary sources is comparable to that of the Aeneas and Romulus myths take in Roman mythology, but altered to suit Germanic tastes. Like many Germanic peoples, the Franks told a founding myth story to explain their connection with peoples of classical history. In the case of the Franks, these people were the Sicambri and the Trojans. An anonymous work of 727 called Liber Historiae Francorum states that following the fall of Troy, 12,000 Trojans led by chiefs Priam and Antenor moved to the Tanais (Don) river, settled in Pannonia near the Sea of Azov and founded a city called \\"Sicambria\\". In just two generations (Priam and his son Marcomer) from the fall of Troy (by modern scholars dated in the late Bronze Age) they arrive in the late 4th century AD at the Rhine. An earlier variation of this story can be read in Fredegar. In Fredegar's version an early king named Francio serves as namegiver for the Francs, just as Romulus has lent his name to Rome. These stories have obvious difficulties if taken as fact. Historians, including eyewitnesses like Caesar, have given us accounts that places the Sicambri firmly at the delta of the Rhine and archaeologists have confirmed ongoing settlement of peoples. Furthermore, the myth does not come from the Sicambri themselves, but from later Franks (of the Carolingian age or later), and includes an incorrect geography. For these reasons, and since the Sicambri were known to have been Germanic, current scholars think that this myth was not prevalent, certainly not historical: For example, J. M. Wallace-Hadrill states that \\"this legend is quite without historical substance\\".Wallace-Hadrill p. ??? Ian Wood says that \\"these tales are obviously no more than legend\\" and \\"nonsensical\\", \\"in fact there is no reason to believe that the Franks were involved in any long- distance migration\\".Wood, p. 33-54. In Roman and Merovingian times it was customary to declare panegyrics. These poetical declarations were held for amusement or propaganda, to entertain guests and please rulers. Panegyrics played an important role in the transmission of culture. A common panegyrical device was anachronism, the use of archaic names for contemporary things. Romans were often called \\"Trojans\\" and Salian Franks were called \\"Sicambri\\". A notable example related by the sixth-century historian Gregory of Tours states that the Merovingian Frankish leader Clovis I, on the occasion of his baptism into the Catholic faith, was referred to as a Sicamber by Remigius, the officiating bishop of Rheims.Gregory, II.31. At the crucial moment of Clovis' baptism, Remigius declared, \\"Bend down your head, Sicamber. Honour what you have burnt. Burn what you have honoured.\\" It is likely that in this way a link between the Sicambri and the Salian Franks, who were Clovis' people, was being invoked. Further examples of Salians being called Sicambri can be found in the Panegyrici Latini, the Life of King Sigismund, the Life of King Dagobert, and other sources. Sacral kingship The religion of Clovis before his adherence to Catholic faith has been disputed,Tessier, p. 427.Daly, pp. ???. and he may have doubted between Catholicism and Arianism for a while. Pagan Frankish rulers probably maintained their elevated positions by their \\"charisma\\" or Heil, their legitimacy and \\"right to rule\\" may have been based on their supposed divine descent as well as their financial and military successes.Wallace-Hadrill, 169. The concept of \\"charisma\\" has been controversial.Schutz, 232 n49. Fredegar tells a story of the Frankish king Chlodio taking a summer bath with his wife when she was attacked by some sort of sea beast, which Fredegar described as bestea Neptuni Quinotauri similis, (\\"the beast of Neptune that looks like a Quinotaur\\"). Because of the attack, it was unknown if Merovech, the legendary founder of the Merovingian dynasty was conceived of Chlodio or the sea beast.Pseudo-Fredegar, III.9. In later centuries, divine kingship myths would flourish in the legends of Charlemagne (768-814) as a divinely-appointed Christian king. He was the central character in the Frankish mythology of the epics known as the Matter of France. The Charlemagne Cycle epics, particularly the first, known as Geste du Roi (\\"Songs of the King\\"), concern a King's role as champion of Christianity. From the Matter of France, sprang some mythological stories and characters adapted through Europe, such as the knights Lancelot and Gawain. Notes References Primary *Pseudo-Fredegar.

Transit systems Rail Amtrak operates the Southwest Chief, Sunset Limited, and Texas Eagle through Arizona. Two Amtrak routes serve Arizona communities: the Southwest Chief passes through Winslow, Flagstaff, and Kingman, while the Texas Eagle passes through Benson, Tucson, Maricopa and Yuma. Although the Texas Eagle passes much closer to Phoenix than the Southwest Chief does, Phoenix is linked to the Amtrak system via motorcoach from Flagstaff. A light rail system called Valley Metro Rail opened in December 2008, connecting Phoenix with the nearby cities of Tempe and Mesa, with plans for expansion in the future. Bus The Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff have public bus systems. Greyhound Lines serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide. Roads and freeways I-10 from New Mexico Main interstate routes include I-17, and I-19 traveling south‚Äìnorth, I-8, I-10, and I-40 traveling west‚Äìeast, and a short stretch of I-15 traveling southwest‚Äìnortheast through the northwestern corner of the state. Phoenix is served by a combination of interstates, U.S. Highways, and state routes, many of which were funded by a ¬Ω cent general sales tax measure approved by Maricopa County voters in 1985. New freeways are being added to the area, such as Loop 101, Loop 202, and eventually SR 24 and SR 30\\\\. Currently, two major interstates serve the area, I-10 and I-17. In the past decade, more than of new freeway have been constructed in the Phoenix metropolitan area by ADOT. The Tucson metropolitan area is primarily served by I-10, I-19, and State Route 77\\\\. I-19 departs from I-10 in the southern part of Tucson, travels through southern Tucson (including an exit serving the historic Mission San Xavier) and the retirement community of Green Valley and terminates in Nogales, in Santa Cruz County, at the international border with Mexico. Destination signs on I-19 have metric distance figures in kilometers instead of standard miles. SR 77 serves North Tucson and Tucson's northern suburbs including Casas Adobes, Catalina Foothills, Oro Valley, and Catalina. SR 77 continues northward until it terminates at the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona. SR 210 (Barraza‚ÄìAviation Parkway) is a limited-access parkway built in the early 1990s to connect downtown Tucson to the southeastern portion of the city. Few new limited-access roads are in the plans in Tucson due to strong community opposition to freeways. However, a large-scale reconstruction and expansion of I-10 was supported and completed in mid-2009. Oatman and Kingman. Yuma is served by I-8, while Casa Grande served by I-8 and I-10; Flagstaff is served by I-17 and I-40. US 95 parallels the Colorado River, from Las Vegas to the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border near Yuma. Historic US 66, a major route for Midwestern emigrants prior to the advent of the interstate highway system, traversed the northern part of the state, passing through Flagstaff and Kingman. US 66 in Arizona closely followed the route of what is now I-40 except for an stretch between Seligman and Kingman now known as SR 66, where the route veered to the north passing through Peach Springs. Bridges and tunnels The Papago Freeway Tunnel, better known to Phoenix residents as the Deck Park Tunnel, is a vehicular tunnel built underneath Downtown Phoenix. It was built as part of I-10 in Phoenix. The tunnel extends from approximately North 3rd Avenue to North 3rd Street. At , it ranks as the 42nd longest vehicular tunnel in the US. The tunnel was the last section of I-10 to be completed nationwide. There is a plaque dedicated to the commemoration of the tunnel in Margaret T. Hance Park. Personal transportation Pedestrians, and bicycles Taxis Personal vehicles Port Infrastructure Airports Airports with scheduled commercial flights include: Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX) in Phoenix (the largest airport and the major international airport in the state); Tucson International Airport (IATA: TUS, ICAO: KTUS) in Tucson; Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in Mesa; Yuma International Airport (IATA: YUM, ICAO: KYUM) in Yuma; Prescott Municipal Airport (PRC) in Prescott; Flagstaff Pulliam Airport (IATA: FLG, ICAO: KFLG) in Flagstaff, and Grand Canyon National Park Airport (GCP), a small, but busy, single-runway facility providing tourist flights, mostly from Las Vegas. Phoenix Sky Harbor is the seventh busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements, and regularly in the top 15 for passengers. Other significant airports without regularly scheduled commercial flights include Scottsdale Municipal Airport (IATA: SCF, ICAO: KSDL) in Scottsdale. Projects In May 2006, voters in Tucson approved a Regional Transportation Plan (a comprehensive bus transit/streetcar/roadway improvement program), and its funding via a new half-cent sales tax increment. The centerpiece of the plan is a light rail streetcar system (possibly similar to the Portland Streetcar in Oregon) that will travel through the downtown area, connecting the main University of Arizona campus with the Rio Nuevo master plan area on the western edge of downtown.

Biography Charles Stedman, born at Philadelphia in 1753, was the second son of Alexander Stedman (1703‚Äì1794) and Elizabeth Chancellor. Stedman was educated for the law at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. Like his father, he remained loyal to the British crown, and, on the start of the American War of Independence, he was appointed commissary to the troops under the command of Sir William Howe. His knowledge of the German language, presumably acquired from early intercourse with the numerous German settlers in Pennsylvania, stood him in good stead, both as interpreter with the Hessian auxiliaries, and afterwards as commander of a rifle corps of colonists from the Palatinate. He was twice taken prisoner, and sentenced to be hanged as a rebel; but on each occasion he managed to escape, once from the same prison that held the ill-fated Major John Andr√©. He was also twice severely wounded. On the conclusion of peace in 1783 he retired to England on the half-pay of a colonel. He was one of those appointed to examine and settle the claims of the American loyalists. Through the influence of the Lord Cornwallis, Lord Rawdon's predecessor in the command, Stedman was in 1797 appointed to the office of deputy controller and accountant-general of the revenue of stamps, with reversion to the chief controllership, which, however, never fell in. He died on 26 June 1812, and was buried at Paddington. Family Stedman married Mary Bowen, by whom he had one son, John, who became judge of the court of admiralty at Gibraltar, and compiled a genealogical memoir of the family (1857). Bibliography In 1794 Stedman's History of the Origin, Progress, and Termination of the American War (2 vols. London, 4to, with folding maps and plans; and in the same year 2 vols., Dublin, 8vo) was published, which still remains the standard work on the subject. It is dedicated to Lord Rawdon, Earl of Moira, his former commander-in-chief. Shortly after it appeared Sir Henry Clinton printed Some Observations upon Mr. Stedman's History (4to, 1794), which impugn the author's accuracy on minor points; but these strictures appear to have been prompted mainly by personal feeling.

Paleobiogeography In southern North America, little changed in the transition from the Judithian to the Edmontonian. However, the northern biome experienced a general trend in reduction of centrosaurines, with leaving Pachyrhinosaurus as one of the few surviving species. Likewise among lambeosaurs, only the single genus Hypacrosaurus remained. Inland faunas of the age are distinguished by a Saurolophus-Anchiceratops association while more coastal areas were characterized by Pachyrhinosaurus and Edmontosaurus. Pachyrhinosaurus occurred as far north as Alaska. \\"Archaic\\" elements such as hypsilophodonts like Parksosaurus and the \\"(re)appearance\\" of basal neoceratopsians like Montanoceratops begin characterizing inland faunas. Paleontologist Thomas M. Lehman described the Edmontonian Arrhinoceratops as a likely ancestor for the Lancian Triceratops. Ecological disturbance brought them to an end during the Edmontonian. Relative sea levels fell very rapidly due to the Laramide orogeny. Opportunistic generalist herbivores filled the vacated niches that were once filled by a diverse number of specialist forms. The newly formed ecosystems tended to be dominated by a single herbivorous species each. The new dominant herbivores were usually less ornamented and probably represent \\"survivors from indigenous lineages\\" rather than immigrants from other areas. Gradually however \\"relict\\" dinosaurs such as protoceratopsids and sauropods began expanding into lower altitude areas as sea-levels fell. Footnotes References  *Lehman, T.

He studied medicine in Berlin, earning his doctorate in 1859 at Breslau. Afterwards he performed hospital duties in Vienna under Ferdinand von Hebra (1816-1880) and in Paris with Alfred Hardy (1811-1893). In 1876 he became director of the policlinic for syphilis and diseases of the skin at the University of Breslau. In 1884 he established a new policlinic in Berlin, where he provided classes for physicians.Heinrich K√∂bner @ Who Named It  Koebner phenomenon  Koebner was a renowned dermatologist known for his research of psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa simplex and various fungal disorders. He is best known for the eponymous \\"Koebner phenomenon\\", also known as isomorphic phenomenon. The Koebner phenomenon is the development of isomorphic pathologic lesions in the traumatized \\"uninvolved skin\\" of persons who have cutaneous diseases such as psoriasis. In other words, if a person has psoriasis, an injury is followed by new psoriatic lesions on the injured but otherwise normal (formerly non-psoriatic) skin, and these new lesions are similar to those of the diseased (originally psoriatic) skin in a clinical and histopathological sense. In 1872, Koebner explained this phenomenon to the Silesian Society for National Culture, by presenting a case in which years after the appearance of an isolated plaque of psoriasis, several \\"traumatic\\" events in various areas of the body (tattoos, animal bite, suppuration from lymphadenitis, et al.) caused new outbreaks of psoriasis at exactly the same locations, in the same shape as the injured skin. \\"Koebnerization\\" may also occur with skin disorders such as vitiligo and lichen planus. The following terms are derived from Koebner's name, and are still used by modern dermatologists: * \\"koebnerization\\": word to describe the isomorphic process taking place. * \\"reverse koebnerization\\": is seen when an area of psoriasis clears; an isomorphic nonresponse. Also referred to as the \\"Renb√∂k phenomenon\\", with the term \\"Renb√∂k\\" being the reverse spelling of \\"K√∂bner\\".JAMA Dermatology Renb√∂k Phenomenon and Contact Sensitization in a Patient With Alopecia Universalis * \\"pseudo-koebnerization\\": is used to describe the spread of an infectious agent such as warts and molluscum contagiosum.

It was introduced in the early 20th century by film manufacturers and intended as a safe film base replacement for unstable and highly flammable nitrate film. Cellulose diacetate film was first created by the German chemists Arthur Eichengr√ºn and Theodore Becker, who patented it under the name Cellit, from a process they devised in 1901 for the direct acetylation of cellulose at a low temperature to prevent its degradation, which permitted the degree of acetylation to be controlled, thereby avoiding total conversion to its triacetate. Cellit was a stable, non-brittle cellulose acetate polymer that could be dissolved in acetone for further processing. A cellulose diacetate film more readily dissolved in acetone was developed by the American chemist George Miles in 1904. Miles's process (partially hydrolysing the polymer) was employed commercially for photographic film in 1909 by Eastman Kodak and the Path√© Fr√©res. Starting with cellulose diacetate, this innovation continued with cellulose acetate propionate and cellulose acetate butyrate in the 1930s, and finally in the late 1940s, cellulose triacetate was introduced, alongside polyester bases. These less flammable substitutes for nitrate film were called safety film. The motion picture industry continued to use cellulose nitrate supports until the introduction of cellulose triacetate in 1948, which met the rigorous safety and performance standards set by the cinematographic industry. The chemical instability of cellulose acetate material, unrecognized at the time of its introduction, has since become a major threat for film archives and collections.  Decay and the \\"vinegar syndrome\\"  The first instance of cellulose triacetate degradation was reported to the Eastman Kodak Company within a decade of its introduction in 1948. The first report came from the Government of India, whose film was stored in hot, humid conditions. It was followed by further reports of degradation from collections stored in similar conditions. These observations resulted in continuing studies in the Kodak laboratories during the 1960s. It can only be delayed by storage in dry and cold conditions. It was initially thought that storage under recommended conditions may delay its development by 450 years; however some films are developing vinegar syndrome after just 70 years of storage under those same conditions.https://theconversation.com/historical-films-may-be-decaying-much- faster-than-we-thought-thanks-to-vinegar-syndrome-131712 Arri and others, based on those assumptions sold film recorders specifically for recording video onto filmhttps://www.tate.org.uk/file/laser-recording-system-colour- microfilm-creating-digital-copies-dying-technologies-project while others used film for archiving based on that assumption,https://www.kodak.com/US/en/motion/Blog/Blog_Post/?contentId=4295001459&utm;_source=&utm;_medium=&utm;_campaign= Although it is not known if the film used for archiving is triacetate or PET plastic film. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a great deal of focus upon film stability following frequent reports of cellulose triacetate degradation. This material releases acetic acid, the key ingredient in vinegar and responsible for its acidic smell. The problem became known as \\"vinegar syndrome.\\" BioArt A Fungi damaged photographic slide  The progression of degradation  In acetate film, acetyl (CH3CO) groups are attached to long molecular chains of cellulose. With exposure to moisture, heat, or acids, these acetyl groups break from their molecular bonds and acetic acid is released. While the acid is initially released inside the plastic, it gradually diffuses to the surface, causing a characteristic vinegary smell. The decay process follows this pattern: * Acetic acid is released during the initial acetate base deterioration, leading to the characteristic vinegar odor. This signal marks the progression of deterioration. * The plastic film base becomes brittle. This occurs in the advanced stages of deterioration, weakening the film and causing it to shatter with the slightest tension. These physical changes happen because cellulose acetate consists of long chains of repeating units, or polymers. When the acetic acid is released as these groups break off, the acidic environment helps to break the links between units, shortening the polymer chains and leading to brittleness. * Shrinkage also occurs during this process. With the cellulose acetate polymer chains breaking into smaller pieces, and with their side groups splitting off, the plastic film begins to shrink. In advanced stages of deterioration, shrinkage can be as much as 10%. There have been some reports of film 35mm wide shrinking to almost 17mm. * As the acetate base shrinks, the gelatin emulsion of the film does not shrink, because it is not undergoing deterioration. The emulsion and film base separate, causing buckling, referred to by archivists as 'channelling.' Sheet films are often severely channelled in the later stages of degradation. * Crystalline deposits or liquid-filled bubbles appear on the emulsion. These are evidence of plasticizers, additives to the plastic base, becoming incompatible with the film base and oozing out on the surface. This discharge of plasticizers is a sign of advanced degradation.Reilly (1993), p. 12. * In some cases, pink or blue colors appear in some sheet films. This is caused by antihalation dyes, which are normally colorless and incorporated into the gelatin layer. When acetic acid is formed during deterioration, the acidic environment causes the dyes to return to their original pink or blue color.  Testing for degradation  A testing product developed by the Image Permanence Institute, A-D, or \\"acid-detection\\" indicator strips change color from blue through shades of green to yellow with increasing exposure to acid. According to the test User's Guide, they were \\"created to aid in the preservation of collections of photographic film, including sheet and roll films, cinema film, and microfilm. They provide a nondestructive method of determining the extent of vinegar syndrome in film collections.\\" These tools can be used to determine the extent of damage to a film collection and which steps should be taken to prolong their usability.  Preservation and storage  Currently there is no practical way of halting or reversing the course of degradation. Many film collectors use camphor tablets but it is not known what the long term effects on the film would be. While there has been significant research regarding various methods of slowing degradation, such as storage in molecular sieves, temperature and moisture are the two key factors affecting the rate of deterioration. According to the Image Permanence Institute, fresh acetate film stored at a temperature of 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) and 40% relative humidity will last approximately 50 years before the onset of vinegar syndrome. Reducing the temperature by 15¬∞ while maintaining the same level of humidity brings a dramatic improvement: at a temperature of 55 ¬∞F (13 ¬∞C) and 40% relative humidity, the estimated time until onset of vinegar syndrome is 150 years. A combination of low temperature and low relative humidity represents the optimum storage condition for cellulose acetate base films, with the caveat that relative humidity should not be lowered below 20%, or the film will dry out too much and become brittle.Reilly (1993), p. 4. Cold storage options for the preservation of acetate film range from insulated cold storage rooms, or vaults, with relative humidity control (typical settings in the range of 35-40 ¬∞F temperature, and 30-35% relative humidity), which might be used by archival institutions for large and medium-sized collections, to free-standing freezer units, which can be cost-effective for small collections, but necessitate vapor-proof packaging of the films to protect against relative humidity extremes and condensation.Wagner, Sarah S. (2007). \\"Cold Storage Options: Costs and Implementation Issues.\\" Topics in Photographic Preservation, Volume 12. Washington, DC: American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. p. 224-238; here: p. 227-229. Commercial storage facilities may offer varying environmental conditions at different rates.Wagner (2007), p. 226; The Film Preservation Guide (2007), p. 63-64. Microenvironments‚Äîthe conditions inside an enclosure‚Äîcan also affect the condition of cellulose acetate film. Enclosures that are breathable or that contain an acid absorbent are instrumental in reducing the rate of decay due to vinegar syndrome. Sealed metal containers can trap the decay products released by the film, promoting the spread of vinegar syndrome.  Rescuing damaged film  During early stages of decay, the film content can be rescued by transferring it to new film stock. Once the film becomes brittle it cannot be copied in its original quality in sight and sound. Because the gelatin emulsion usually stays intact during the degradation process, it is possible to save the image on sheet film using solvents to dissolve the base off the emulsion. Once the emulsion has been freed from the shrunken support, it can be photographed or transferred to a new support. Because of the solvents used, this is a delicate and potentially hazardous procedure and is an expensive process for a large collection. Degraded motion picture film cannot be restored in this way, but sheet films often can. While digitization would be an ideal way to preserve the contents of cellulose acetate film, current standards do not allow for scanning at sufficient resolutions to produce a copy of the same picture and sound quality as the original. Currently, the U.S. National Film Preservation Foundation advocates film-to-film transfer as the best method for film preservation, with the copies stored in proper environmental conditions.  Other uses  Cellulose acetate film is also used to make replicates of materials and biological samples for microscopy. The techniques were developed for metallographic needs to examine the grain structure of polished metals. Replication can be used to understand the distribution, for example, of different types of iron in carbon steel samples, or the fine distribution of damage to a sample subject to mechanical wear.

The city was besieged and captured before the normal commencement of the campaigning season with minimal losses. The outcome was not in doubt, but in a conflict dominated by siege warfare, neither the French army of King Louis XIV, nor the forces of the Grand Alliance under King William III, could bring about a decisive battle. After the siege the duc de Boufflers bombarded the neutral city of Liege, whilst the duc de Luxembourg captured Halle, and scored a minor victory against the Prince of Waldeck at the Battle of Leuze in September. Strategically, however, little had changed in the war, and both combatants returned to winter quarters at the end of the campaigning season. Background French forces had secured considerable success in 1690. In July Luxembourg fought and won his tactical masterpiece at the Battle of Fleurus, nullifying any Allied hopes of invading France, whilst at sea, Admiral Tourville defeated an Anglo-Dutch fleet off Beachy Head. In August Catinat had triumphed at the Battle of Staffarda in northern Italy (although his force was too small to gain any strategic advantage). The only bright spot for the Grand Alliance in 1690 was King William's victory over James II in Ireland at the Battle of the Boyne.Wolf: The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685-1715, p. 44 Yet despite the battlefield successes, French forces in 1690 had failed to break the coalition ranged against the ambitions of King Louis. In 1691 the French had planned for a double strike: Nice in northern Italy, and Mons in the Spanish Netherlands. The Netherlands were again where France would concentrate its main war effort, and was a theatre where Louis‚Äô war minister, Louvois, had striven to bring together an even larger army than had been assembled the year before.Wolf: Louis XIV, p. 562 These attacks on Nice and Mons were planned for very early in the campaign season, illustrating Vauban‚Äôs dictum that \\"It is a very favourable circumstance to be able to attack before the enemy takes the field in strength ‚Ä¶ \\"Chandler: The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough, p. 241 Meanwhile, in Ireland the war continued into 1691, but William now felt secure enough on his new throne in the British Isles to return to the war on the Continent. William entered The Hague on 5 February to organise his army for the coming campaign. After securing forces totalling 220,000 men, the Stadtholder-King retired to his country home. In mid-March, surrounded by representatives of the Grand Alliance, he received news that Mons was under siege.Lynn: The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667‚Äì1714, p. 216 Siege Louvois engineered the considerable preparations for the siege throughout the preceding winter: stores were filled with supplies in Namur, Philippeville, Dinant and Givet, and no less than 21,000 labourers were gathered for the construction of the lines of circumvallation.Chandler: The Art of Warfare in the Age of Marlborough, p. 224 Louis, accompanied by members of his court, joined his army in the Spanish Netherlands to take control of the armies in theatre, arriving at the front on 21 March. The King's besieging army of 46,000 (under the direction of his great engineer, Vauban) surrounded the town and its garrison of some 4,800 men. The Allies had formed an army of 38,000 under William to relieve the city, but Luxembourg's army of observation, also 46,000 strong, denied the Allies any possibility of disrupting the operation.Wolf: Louis XIV, p. 563 Marshal Boufflers began the investment on 15 March; the trenches were opened ten days later. In one of the most intense attacks of all King Louis‚Äô wars, two batteries, each consisting of 12 mortars, bombarded the city in preparation for the assault; by 30 March, the French had fired 7,000 cannonballs and 3,000 mortar shells.Lynn: The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667‚Äì1714, p. 218 Inevitably, at 17:00 on 8 April, the besieged inhabitants beat the chamade; conditions were settled, and the remaining men of the garrison marched out two days later. Aftermath Contemporary plan showing the bombardment and investment of Mons in 1691. The siege had begun and ended before the normal commencement of campaigning. Louis returned to Versailles on 12 April, whilst William, after distributing his troops to various garrisons, returned to The Hague. The French now prepared for the rest of the 1691 campaign season with the creation of five large armies bound for five major fronts: Flanders, the Moselle, the Rhine, Piedmont, and Roussillon. The largest of these forces, 49 battalions and 140 squadrons under the command Luxembourg, took station in Flanders, but little was accomplished after the siege by either the French or the Grand Alliance. Luxembourg devastated Halle at the end of May, whilst Boufflers bombarded neutral Liege in early June, but these aggressive acts had no political results.Wolf: Louis XIV, p. 564 Louis‚Äô personal military advisor and expert in the art of war, the Marquis de Chamlay, argued that these victories should be followed by a field battle that would destroy the Allied army and force a conclusion to the conflict. Louvois, however, suggested a bombardment of Brussels would force the issue, but was opposed by Luxembourg and Vauban. William, meanwhile, arrived at Anderlecht on 2 June to take command of the Allied army of 63 battalions and 180 squadrons, totalling 56,000 men. Luxembourg successfully manoeuvred to prevent William besieging Dinant, but subsequent manoeuvres produced little action. After William left his troops in the command of the Prince of Waldeck, Luxembourg's cavalry routed part of the Allied army at Leuze on 18 September, before all combatants returned to winter quarters.

It was formerly placed in the genus Listera, but molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Neottia nidus-avis, the Bird's-nest Orchid, evolved within the same group., p. 864 It is never very common but may be frequently overlooked because of its small size and a tendency to grow underneath heather on sphagnum moss. The single erect flower-stem is often tinged red and is clasped near the base by a pair or ovate-orbicular glossy green leaves. The small flowers which look deceptively simple in structure for an orchid, are purple-green in colour with a somewhat swollen calyx.

The name Ceradyne Bull is a misnomer; \\"The Bull\\" is actually a trade-mark of Ideal Innovations, Inc. (I-3). The MRAP II competition was announced in 2007 when it became clear that explosively formed penetrator (EFP) type of roadside bomb attacks were increasing in Iraq and the current generation MRAP vehicles could not stop all of them without add-on armor kits. In 2005 Ideal Innovations' President, Robert Kocher, had worked with the U.S. Army Research Laboratory to find an EFP solution, patented it, and then found Ceradyne as a partner in 2006 to produce an armored cab out of it. The U.S. Army's Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center at the Rock Island Arsenal provides the EFP-stopping outer layers of the armor. Kocher had previously been involved in the 1991-93 development of the up-armored Humvee and was part of the team that developed the boron carbide armor now used in Interceptor body armor vests that Ceradyne produces. In 2007 Oshkosh was selected to provide its Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) chassis, with their TAK-4 independent suspension system and Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) computer hardware, for the vehicles I3 and Ceradyne intended to enter in the MRAP II competition. Two prototypes were made within 50 days. Team Bull members at Ceradyne, together with almost three dozen employees from I3 and Oshkosh, immediately began working round-the-clock shifts. Engineers rarely left the site, with team members instead grabbing a couple of hours of sleep outside in their cars for refreshment. A six-person version and a ten-person version were delivered to the Aberdeen Proving Grounds for testing. The EFP simulations were so successful that the military quickly adapted the armor into the Frag kit 6 armor upgrade kits for the Humvee and other MRAP vehicles. Senators Carl Levin (D-Mich) and Joseph Biden (D-Del) took up Bull‚Äôs cause. Levin wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Gates promoting the vehicle and Biden asked, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee event, why the military hadn‚Äôt ordered the vehicle. After testing the initial two prototypes, the military awarded the partnership a $18.1 million contract to produce six more Bull vehicles of the six person variant by the first quarter of 2008 for further evaluation. While eight vehicles entered the MRAP II competition, The Bull was one of only two vehicles to receive a contract from it. The other was an uparmored BAE Caiman. It has been reported that the complete vehicle weighs around 40,000 lbs and costs about $500,000 (three times more than a Humvee). The Bull prototypes had two side hatches at the front (meeting MRAP II specs), used mainly for emergency exits. This design gave more side protection than larger traditional doors. The Bull had no gun ports, but these could be added in the final production model.

He spent all of his club career playing with FC Barcelona. He was named the Mister Europa European Player of the Year in 1984, by the Italian basketball magazine Superbasket, and the Best European Player of the 1980s decade, by the French sports newspaper L'√âquipe. He was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991. At the Opening Ceremony of the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic Games, he was honoured with being the last athlete to carry the Olympic torch, before handing it to the archer, Antonio Rebollo, who lit the fire in the cauldron, with an arrow. He was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. He became a FIBA Hall of Fame player in 2016. He is considered to be one of the greatest small forwards to ever play in Europe. Early life and career San Epifanio, known by almost everyone as simply, \\"Epi\\", grew up in Zaragoza, and began to play the sport of basketball in his native city. In 1973, Epi made his club debut with CN Helios, in the Spanish third division. However, his local club eventually rejected him. In 1974, FC Barcelona signed his older brother, Herminio, to a contract. Herminio then insisted that Epi would also join him at the club, and so the two moved to Barcelona. FC Barcelona's senior men's team head coach, Ranko ≈Ωeravica, gave Epi the opportunity to play with the club's youth teams. Professional career FC Barcelona In 1977, Epi joined the senior men's team of FC Barcelona. He quickly became the team's lead player. He would eventually go on to lead FC Barcelona to break the long-lived dominance of Real Madrid in Spain. During his career with the club, his teammates included Nacho Soloz√°bal, Juan de la Cruz, Audie Norris, Andr√©s Jim√©nez, and other well-known players. In a total of eighteen seasons with FC Barcelona (1977‚Äì78 to 1994‚Äì95), he won the top-level Spanish League title seven times, as he won the LEB Primera Divisi√≥n (1981, 1983), and the Liga ACB (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1995). He also won the Spanish King's Cup ten times (1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1987, 1988, 1991, and 1994), the FIBA Saporta Cup twice (1985 and 1986), the FIBA Koraƒá Cup once (1987), and the FIBA Club World Cup once (1985). Although he reached the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) Finals 3 times (1984, 1990, 1991), he never lifted the most important trophy in European-wide club basketball. He was named the MVP of the FIBA Club World Cup's 1987 edition. His 54 points scored in a game against Joventut Badalona, in 1984, counts among his most memorable performances. It is the second best single-game scoring total ever in the history of the top- tier level Spanish league (since 1957), and the highest ever single-game scoring mark in the history of the Spanish Liga ACB (since 1983). National team career In 1979, Epi made his first appearance with the senior Spanish national team. With Spain's senior national team, he appeared in a total of 239 games, over a 15-year long period (1979‚Äì1994). He is in second place all- time in senior national team appearances for Spain (behind J. C. Navarro). He was also the first Spanish national team player that took part in four Summer Olympic Games, from the (1980 Moscow Summer Olympics, to the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics). He was a silver Olympic medalist at the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics, and a silver medalist at the EuroBasket 1983. He also won a bronze medal at the EuroBasket 1991. Post-playing career San Epifanio concluded his professional basketball playing career on 25 May 1995, as F.C. Barcelona won another Spanish League title. Since 2007, he has been a basketball color commentator with Canal+ Spain.

That same year, he won the first doubles tournament in the U.S. National Championships (later called the U.S. Open), playing with Frederick Winslow Taylor, after defeating first the favored Richard Sears/James Dwight, and in the final round, Alexander Van Rensselaer/Arthur Newbold. In 1882, he reached the final of the championships, where he lost to reigning champion Sears in straight sets. Clark also reached the semifinals in 1884. He married the sister of his doubles partner, Taylor, who would go on to a noted career as an engineer and organizational theorist. In 1900, Clark became a partner in his family's firm, E. W. Clark & Co., placed in charge of public utility investments. \\"He was a pioneer in the development of electric light, electric power, and electric street railway companies,\\" according to his obituary in the New York Times.

It is the follow up studio album to Queen's debut effort En Mi Imperio released in 1997. The album includes Queen's debut single \\"In The Zone\\" featuring Wyclef Jean, which helped to increase the album and Queen's exposure to American audiences. Background After the success of her debut studio album En Mi Imperio (1997), which as of February 2004 has sold over 180,000 copies, Ivy Queen was quickly signed to the Sony label and began recording material for her second album. However, due to her inexperience in the music business Queen did not receive any profits from the sales of En Mi Imperio. In 1998, while Wyclef Jean was touring Puerto Rico, Ivy Queen attended one of his concerts. Wyclef then sent an invitation for fans to come up on stage if they thought they could \\"flow\\". With encouragement from her friends, Queen stepped on stage an amazed Jean enough that they later met again in New York to record a song. Following the lawsuit filed against DJ Negro, producer of En Mi Imperio, Sony Discos decided to produce and develop music directly for Queen, as they were unhappy with the work produced by Negro. Release and promotion The album was released on December 15, 1998. Ivy Queen embarked on a tour shortly after throughout Puerto Rico and the United States. The lead single, \\"In The Zone\\" was released February 9, 1999. An accompanying music video was also shot and released. It was directed by Jeff Kennedy and produced by George Barnes. A second music video was filmed and directed by Gabriel Goldberg. A remix version was also recorded and included on the album featuring extra verses from both Queen and Jean. A second single, \\"Ritmo Latino\\" featuring Victor Vargas and WepaMan was also released in 1999. The album was reissued by Sony Discos on August 25, 1999 with an alternate remix of \\"In The Zone\\" as the closing track. In August 1998, she performed at Disney Beach Club Resort along with other artists from the Sony Discos label over the course of three days. She appeared at the 1999 Latin Alternative Music Conference before she became famous and was questioned as to why she was there. The founder, Thomas Cookman responded in her defense with \\"because she's valid\\". Musical style and composition The album is a bilingual set featuring music from the Hip-Hop genre, a departure from the musical styles of reggaeton featured on her debut effort. \\"In The Zone\\" was written by Ivy Queen, Wyclef Jean, and Omar Navarro, known artistically as Gran Omar. Gran Omar was Queen's then-husband at the time. The song is a hip-hop track, like much of the album. Queen's verses and chorus are sung in Spanish, and Jean's verses are sung in English. Reception While the album itself was not successful commercially, \\"In The Zone\\" managed to chart at number 38 on the Billboard Rhythmic Top 40. David Jeffries of Allmusic gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 stars providing no review while listing the album as an \\"Allmusic Pick\\". The Spanish magazine Remezcla listed the album as one of the most influential Latin music albums released in 1998.http://remezcla.com/lists/music/latino-albums-1998-20th-anniversary/ According to Patricia Meschino of the Miami New Times the song was a solid collaboration with Jean which introduced her to a new audience.
