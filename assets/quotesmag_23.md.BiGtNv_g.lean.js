Husband-and-wife team Eric Lindberg and Doni Zasloff are the principal members.  History  Doni Zasloff grew up in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, and earned a degree in musical theater from Brandeis University. She began writing her own songs while teaching at her daughter's synagogue preschool, eventually forming the Mama Doni Band, which won the Simcha Award at the 2008 International Jewish Music Festival. Eric Lindberg grew up in Brooklyn but often visited his father's family in Georgia, where he developed an appreciation for bluegrass music. He began playing guitar at the age of 10, inspired by blues musicians like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. He also cites Pat Metheny and Bela Fleck as influences on his work. He has a degree in jazz performance from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University. The two began writing music together in 2010, originally for Zasloff's career as \\"Mama Doni\\", but found that the mashup of Jewish liturgy and bluegrass melodies worked. At the same time, the two became a couple and eventually married. They characterize their music as a continuation of the cultural exchange between Jews and the countries they live in that produced musical genres such as klezmer. They started out performing their music at Shabbat services, and then at shows. By 2014, they settled on the name \\"Nefesh Mountain\\" (nefesh is the Hebrew word for soul) and went on tour with bass player Tim Kiah and violinist Alan Grubner. They recorded the album Beneath The Open Sky in Nashville, Tennessee, recording with veteran bluegrass musicians Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Tony Trischka, and David Grier.

Youth Biederman was born in Brand√Ωs nad Labem in 1973, but his family soon moved to Tlustovous (now part of the Tuklaty village) in the Kol√≠n District. In his early life he didn't differ much from his peers, as he came from a loving family, was an average student and did not cause trouble at school. After primary school, he began his studies in the field of biochemistry with a focus on distillery and viticulture at the Kojet√≠n SOU. In the second year, he was forced to interrupt school due to disciplinary problems and went to work in the Kol√≠n distillery. After a year, he returned to learning and graduated with honors. Biederman worked in the distillery until 1993, and since he began to develop an intensive interest in weapons and martial arts, he found a job as a security guard. He went through several security agencies before he stopped working completely in 1994. Murders Josef Dovhaniƒç (36) In the spring of 1993, SAFE-GUARD's operational director Ivan Vr√°bel was scheduled to work with two other employees, Roman Proch√°zka and Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†≈•astn√Ω, whom planned to a Krone department store in Prague. The guarding of the facility was provided by their agency, so they had a good overview of the building's security. Proch√°zka and ≈†≈•astn√Ω had to get in service uniforms to the back door, eliminate the guard and rob the safe. None of them, however, was willing to kill the guard, and so, they convinced Oto Biederman after two previous unsuccessful attempts. On the night of July 6‚Äì7, ≈†≈•astn√Ω, Proch√°zka and Biederman went to the Krone department store dressed in the uniforms, which was located on the corner of Jind≈ôi≈°sk√° Street and Wenceslas Square. As Proch√°zka guarded the building's front, Biederman attacked the guard Josef Dovhaniƒç with a tonfa. When he fell on the ground, the two criminals cut him with a wire before finally stabbing Josef with a knife and a needle. The trio took away more than 3,000,000 koruna from the store, from which Biederman only received 200,000. Martin Srb (28) In the spring of 1995, Martin Srb, owner of a small gloves factory, mentioned his planned trip to the United States, for which a large amount of money had to be prepared at his vault at home. The gang, who knew Srb, chose to lure him to a lonely place, kill him there, and rob the keys from the safe that he was supposed to carry around. On the evening of June 1, Biederman and Jaroslav Pavl√≠ƒçek met Srb in the village of ≈†kvorec, inviting him to a billiard club in Prague 21. They strolled towards a deserted parking lot, where someone was supposed to join them. As soon as Srb stepped out of his car, Biederman approached him and shot him twice in the heart and head. The body was then taken to the house of another accomplice, Milan Chl√°dek, but only found 7,000 koruna and a few details when they searched the corpse. The criminals then buried the body, and Srb's vault had to be seized without the keys. His house was kept for a days, and only after the deceased's wife and children left, the gang members got inside and stole the safe. They cut it in Biederman's house, but did not find any money. This was due to the fact that after her husband's disappearance, Srb's wife had taken all the money from the house. She also told the authorities that she had seen Biederman and Pavl√≠ƒçek on the day of the murder, but there was not conclusive proof to the allegations. Zdenƒõk Langer (43) On June 7, 1995, Biederman and Chl√°dek decided to rob a gas station, choosing the 'MOTA Pump' in Prague 9. While Chl√°dek was watching the car, Biederman asked Langer for a pack of cigarettes. As they went in, he aimed at his head with a revolver and instructed to take out the money. Langer handed over a wallet with 30,000 koruna to Biederman. At that moment, Chl√°dek opened the door to check the situation, causing Langer to move and Biederman to subsequently shoot him in the head. When the latter was leaving, he shot again. Together with Chl√°dek, all the stolen money was spent that same night at a nightclub. Jaroslav Pavl√≠ƒçek (27) Another one of Biederman's victims became the former accomplice Pavl√≠ƒçek. He had inherited land in Prague, which Ivan Vr√°bel wanted to take possession of and use them for business. Vr√°bel told Pavl√≠ƒçek his intention to buy the land at a fair price, scheduling a meeting on September 28 together with Biederman, who would pick him up at his parents' house. The former invited the latter to his room and settled Jaroslav on the couch, before opening a wardrobe, taking out a submachine gun and shooting Pavl√≠ƒçek six times. Because it seemed that he was still moving, Biederman stabbed him in the heart with a dagger. He then put the body in the wardrobe and buried the body at night near the house. His family was present at home during the murder, but they weren't surprised from the gunshots, as Oto reportedly often shot in his room. However, the gang did not gain any land, because it was not fully transferred to Pavl√≠ƒçek at the time of his death. Tom√°≈° Bleier (45) At the end of 1995, Vr√°bel was approached by a group of entrepreneurs in Litv√≠nov. A pair of men from the Vset√≠n District owed 2,000,000 koruna for the taken goods, and so the entrepreneurs had therefore chosen for one of them to be murdered. The victim chosen was Tom√°≈° Bleier. The gang members to undertake the job were Chl√°dek, Biederman and a new member - Miroslav Karno≈°. They would lure him with a profitable deal, and at their first meeting in Vala≈°sk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠, Bleier told them he was only interested in the trade of non-ferrous metal. Under this pretext, the group invited him to the Apollo Hotel on January 17, 1996. Biederman secured a hotel room using a stolen ID card, in which he, Karno≈° and Bleier would meet in, with Chl√°dek waiting prepared in the car. They began discussing the sale of copper. Bleier, however, settled in a chair, making it impossible for a planned attack. It was only when he was asked about the size of the promised copper that Karno≈° had prompted him to the window to show a warehouse near the hotel. As Bleier stood up and walked to the window, Biederman put his hand over his mouth and stabbed him in the stomach with a dagger. When Bleier slumped down, both men punched him several times in the throat and chest. They robbed the body, put it in bed, locked the room and broke the key and lock.SLU≈†N√ù, Jarom√≠r. Black Book of Czech Bestial Murderers . Praha: Nakladatelstv√≠ XYZ, sro, 2006. Capture and sentence The search for Bleier's killers involved police units in several counties, as it was necessary to map his extensive business activities. An important testimony was given by some random passers-by, who spotted a red Renault 25 with noticeably muddy license plates on the day of the murder. Bleier's family managed to decode his electronic diary, in which there was information about the red Renault, which was owned by Miroslav Karno≈°, whom he had met briefly before the murder. Karno≈°, after his detention, refused to confess to the murder. In order to secure his alibi, however, he introduced the names of Biederman and Chl√°dek, who had moved to the North Moravian Region that day. Both were soon detained, and the men accused Karno≈° of the crime. He, after getting acquainted with their testimonies, decided to reveal the truth not only about Bleier's killing, but also about all previous murders.VOJTOV√Å, Tereza.

It was created in 2016 by the Venezuelan government with the objective of knowing the socioeconomic status of the population and streamlining the system of the Bolivarian missions and that of the local committees of supply and production (CLAP). The document has a digital wallet that is articulated within a state electronic payment system and in which carriers can also receive different monetary bonds from the Venezuelan State. However, the use of the card has been reported as a possible method of social control, a policy of social exclusion as well as coercion and vote buying during the 2017 Venezuelan regional elections, the 2017 Venezuelan municipal elections and the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election. Creation It was created on December 18, 2016, when President Nicol√°s Maduro announced the creation of the Homeland card system in his weekly television program Contacto con Maduro. He also pointed out that the technological platform of the card has been materialized through agreements with China. Then, on January 20, 2017, the first day of registration to acquire the Homeland card began. By May 2017, more than 13 million Venezuelans have processed their Homeland card, assigning more than 200.000 cards from the Mission Hogares de la Patria and at least 50.000 student scholarships. Processing In principle, the acquisition of the Homeland card is free and not mandatory. To process it requires a photo, Venezuelan identity card (Spanish: C√©dula de identidad) and information about the existence of health problems, participation in electoral processes and if the person enjoys any of the social missions of the national government. Controversies The writer Leonardo Padr√≥n described the card as a \\"hunger- for-votes exchange\\", saying: \\"Give me your signature, take your CLAP [food box].\\" On the other hand, the organization secretary of the Alianza Bravo Pueblo party, Alcides Padilla, criticized the Homeland card, saying that \\"through this card, the government wants to ration food for Venezuelans.\\" Similarly, the Communist Party of Venezuela has ensured that the card is a policy of exclusion and that all the inhabitants of the country have constitutional rights that can not be dependent on said document. In August 2018, Venezuelan pensioners protested in front of the main offices of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security (IVSS), complaining that the requirement of the Homeland Card to collect their pension limited their access. In September 2018, the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, said he had received complaints from patients who had been denied chemotherapy treatment for not having the Homeland card. The Reuters news agency has also received complaints from state doctors denying insulin prescriptions to diabetic patients for not being enrolled in the Homeland card system. Benito Urrea, a 76-year-old diabetic, said a state physician recently denied him an insulin prescription and accused him of being a member of the \\"right\\" because he had not enrolled in the card system.  Elections  During the 2017 Venezuelan regional elections, the 2017 Venezuelan municipal elections and the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election, there were complaints of the use of the Homeland card as the coercion method of the voter. Reports of vote buying were also prevalent during the presidential campaigning. Venezuelans suffering from hunger were pressured to vote for Maduro, with the government bribing potential supporters with food. Maduro promised rewards for citizens who scanned their Carnet de la Patria at the voting booth, which would allow the government to monitor the political party of their citizens and whether or not they had voted. These prizes were reportedly never delivered.

Since 2011 the cooperative has adapted to compete with Whole Foods Market and Natural Grocers in the Boise metropolitan area. History The Boise Consumers' Cooperative was founded in April, 1973, as an organization of consumers who wanted to buy produce and bulk food items at wholesale prices. The co-op received a grant of $2000 from El-Ada, a southern Idaho advocacy group that also provided the original storage and distribution space for the startup. El-Ada was funded with a grant from the Office of Economic Opportunity. Gene Drabinski, an El- Ada community organizer, articulated the co-op strategy as having \\"no salaries, no manager, no secretaries. Everybody will share the load.\\"The Idaho Statesman described the era as the \\"hippy trippy days of 1973,\\" see The co-op elected a board of seven directors in May, 1973, and among the board members was Ken Kavanaugh, later the co-op's general manager. At the time, 65 families had joined the co-op. Soon the co-op moved to 1743 Broadway Avenue in Boise, a location near El-Ada headquarters, and in 1975 the 200-member organization moved to 1515 North 13th Street in Boise's Hyde Park neighborhood. Members were asked to donate one hour per month to help with bulk food transportation and packaging. Grocery items included produce, dairy, grains, and canned goods. Most of the members were vegetarians, and meat was not offered in the store. The co-op moved in 1984 to a shopping area at Hill Road and Harrison Street, and in 1995 it moved into its current 26,000 square foot location at 888 West Fort Street. An early supporter of Idaho Power's green power program, the co-op installed skylights in its store to reduce demand for electricity, and it rerouted energy discharged by refrigeration compressors to its hot water tanks. In 2005 the co-op opened FlipSide Cafe near its store on Fort Street, but the restaurant was not profitable, and it closed within two years. Then in 2007 the co-op wine shop opened, and in 2012 the co-op pet shop opened, both across from the main store on Fort Street. Employees considered unionizing in 2011, after longtime general manager Ken Kavanaugh was fired, but the union plan was not successful. In 2015 at least 250 cases of salmonella poisoning were traced to food served at the co-op's deli. Weeks later, health inspectors again found violations at the deli and in the co-op's produce department. Boise Co-op opened a second location in Meridian in November, 2015. Sales revenue was lower than expected at the new store, and the co-op laid off 18 employees the following January. Six employees at the Fort Street location also were laid off, and layoffs amounted to nine percent of total workforce. Annual Report Boise Co-op has published its financial information for the past few years on its website. In 2018 the co-op counted over 31,000 members, including almost 3500 new members. Total assets were over $10 million, and sales for the year were almost $40 million with net income slightly over $800,000. Sales increased 11 percent over the year 2017. Nearly 19 percent of its 235 employees had been with the co-op for over 10 years. The co-op donated over $33,000 to 80 charities, and it conducted 65 workshops, classes, and tours.

The National Remote Sensing Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) carried out an assessment of the total area affected by the fire. On 25 February 2019, it estimated the extent of burnt area to be about 10,920 acres in the last five days since 21 February 2019. Though the major fire was brought under control by 24 February 2019, some areas continued to burn. The fire also spread to Mudumalai forest range in Tamil Nadu, causing damage in around 40 acres. The Tamil Nadu forest department took action to ensure that it did not spread further.  Background  On 21 February 2019, wildfire broke out in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve. Unlike in previous years, this is the first time the wildfire in Bandipur flared up earlier due to the sudden climatic change and rapid growth of dry grass and Lantana. Officials reported that there appeared to have been no deaths of the larger mammals in the Park, such as bison, elephants, leopard and tiger. Over 10,000 acres of forest in Bandipur area was destroyed. With the fire spreading rapidly due to winds, the authorities closed the Gundlupet- Ooty National highway and safaris in Bandipur National Park were also cancelled. Strong winds were making the job of firefighters, forest staff and volunteers more difficult. The fire that destroyed Kundakere Range, spread to Barakatte and Guddakere, then to the Himavathi Gopalaswamy Hills. It also destroyed forests in Jarkal Kere and Gowri Kalu hills. Many smaller mammals and reptiles were killed, along with thousands of trees. There had been no forest-fire incidents noted in Bandipur National Park in the previous two years. Firefighting Forest department crew and local people helping to douse the Bandipur forest fire on 24 February 2019. Two Mi-17 Indian Air Force helicopters were deployed on 25 February 2019 afternoon to douse the fire, which had been raging for three days in the Bandipur Tiger Reserve. The operation on 25 February 2019 was primarily limited to the Gopalaswamy Hills Range in Karnataka's Chamarajanagar district. The other two ranges that were seriously affected were Kundakere and Bandipur. The helicopters were deployed after Karnataka state Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy called on the Indian Air Force for help. One proceeded towards Karadikal hill ranges while the other fought fires in the general area of Chammana halla top. Bolagudda and Kanive temple area were also subject to helicopter fire control A total of 10 sorties were flown, dropping approximately 30,000 litres of water. Damage assessment Sentinel-2 Satellite images of the wildfire affected area Satellite images shown the extent of the damage caused by the wildfire. The National Remote Sensing Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Hyderabad, released a report based on Sentinel-2 satellite data, which reported that 15,443.27 acres of forest area damaged by the fire between 23 February 2019 and 25 February 2019 in Bandipur forest region alone. Nature Conservation Foundation's Wildlife Scientist Mysore Doreswamy Madhusudan estimated that 17,000 acres would have been affected since the National Remote Sensing Centre excluded the damage in administratively part of Bandipur (Revenue land). Number of casualties due to fire has not estimated yet. Wildlife officials say that small animals, reptiles, which are slow-moving, would have borne the brunt, while bigger mammals like leopards and tigers would have fled to the Bandipur Tiger Reserve and taken refuge in nearby areas.  Investigation  Karnataka's top forest official confirmed that an \\"act of sabotage\\" had caused the blaze. Forest officials have arrested two shepherds for allegedly setting fire to the forest. Fearing tiger attacks on their cattle in Bandipur, on 22 February 2019 they had sparked the fire to chase away a tiger which was spotted in the area for a month or so, leading to massive fire, which destroyed thousands of acres of Bandipur forest area. The accused were booked under Indian section 27, 29, 30, 31, 50 and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

He and his three murdered comrades were rescued from anonymity thanks to a poem by Erich Weinert entitled \\"John Schehr und Genossen\\". Biography Eugen Sch√∂nhaar was born at Esslingen am Neckar, an prosperous industrial town to the east of Stuttgart. His father was a skilled industrial worker. Sch√∂nhaar completed an apprenticeship which prepared him to follow in his father's footsteps. In 1912, the year of his fourteenth birthday, he joined the Young Workers' movement (\\"Arbeiterjugendbewegung\\"). During the war which broke out in July 1914 he joined the anti-war Spartacus League. In 1916 he was arrested and sentenced to three months imprisonment because he had spoken out against the continuing war. In Autumn/Fall 1917, around the time of his nineteenth birthday, he was conscripted for military service. War ended late in 1918 and as the defeated armies made their way home, at the start of 1919 Sch√∂nhaar returned home. During the ensuing months of revolution the anti-war Spartacus League disappeared, but many of its members, inspired by events in Moscow two years earlier, now founded the Communist Party of Germany, formally launched at a three day conference held at Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919. The party leaders were assassinated by conservative paramilitaries (with government backing) a couple of weeks later, but the Communist Party endured and Eugen Sch√∂nhaar, who had found work in an Esslingen engineering plant, joined it. He also became chairman of the local Young Socialists. In December 1920 Sch√∂nhaar took part in the fifth national congress of the Young Communists and was elected to join the party's national head office team. Till May 1921 he served as an editor of the party journal, \\"Die junge Garde\\". In July 1921 and again in December 1922 he travelled to Moscow as a German delegate to the Young Communist International (YCI) second and third congresses and was elected to membership of the Executive Committee of the international organisation. For some time he worked in the YCI's Berlin office. Then after the Moscow congress in December 1922 he remained in the Soviet Union for approximately one and a half years, supporting himself by applying the factory skills that he had acquired in Esslingen. From the latter part of 1923 he was employed with the Executive Committee of International Red Aid (\\"–ú–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æÃÅ–¥–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞ÃÅ—Ü–∏—è –ø–æÃÅ–º–æ—â–∏ –±–æ—Ä—Ü–∞ÃÅ–º —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—éÃÅ—Ü–∏–∏\\" / –ú–û–ü–† / IRA) an international Moscow-backed workers' political welfare organisation. He returned to Berlin in May 1924. It was also in 1924 that he married Odette, the daughter of a longstanding militant communist originally from Lausanne. She had been working as a typist-secretary for L'Humanit√©, the Paris based communist daily newspaper in 1922 when she had relocated to Berlin to join the large Communist International (Comintern) operation in the city. Her politics were aligned with her husbands, and during their ten year marriage she appears to have shared the itinerant lifestyle to which his political activism led. In Berlin he headed up the Central Europe office (\\"Mitteleurop√§ischen B√ºros\\" / MEB) of the IRA. He was also actively involved with the \\"AM-Apparat\\", a consciously misleadingly named intelligence service that operated under the direction of the Communist Party. It was through this connection that he learned that he faced the risk of arrest: in 1927 he therefore went back to Moscow where he resumed his work for the Executive Committee of the IRA. In July 1928 this organisation sent him to the United States of America where he \\"continued with his illegal activity\\" In 1929 he returned to Germany where politics were becoming increasingly polarised. He was now employed in the secretariat of the Party Central Committee: his responsibilities included the printing of illegal reading matter. By 1932 German politics had become not merely polarised but deadlocked. The Communists and National Socialists between them won a majority of parliamentary seats in the July election, but would not enter into a governing coalition together, and the more moderate political parties were for the most part determined not to collaborate with the extremists. In January 1933 the National Socialists were able to take power. The new Hitler government lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. Political activity (except in support of the government) became illegal. In the aftermath of the Reichstag fire it quickly became clear that the Communists filled the top positions on the governments' targets list. Many fled abroad during March while many others were arrested. Eugen Sch√∂nhaar continued to be politically active in Berlin, though by February 1933 he was identifying himself under the pseudonym, \\"Ewald Rackwitz\\". He worked (illegally) for a party leadership team (\\"Inlandsleitung\\") under John Schehr. On 11 November 1933 Eugen Sch√∂nhaar was arrested, along with fellow party activists John Schehr and Rudolf Schwarz. During the night of 1/2 February 1934 these three, together with Erich Steinfurth (who had been arrested back in March 1933) were shot dead at the Sch√§ferberg / Kilometerberg (hill) on the edge of Berlin by Gestapo personnel, allegedly \\"while attempting to escape\\". In reality the murder was an act of quick retribution following the shooting the previous day of the government spy Alfred Kattner. The orphan and the widow Eugen Sch√∂nhaar's son, Carlo Sch√∂nhaar (1924‚Äì1942), was also opposed to the National Socialists. After his father's arrest he escaped to Lausanne in francophone Switzerland where he stayed with his maternal grand parents. They were joined by his mother shortly after his father's murder. Threatened by the authorities with being sent back to Germany, they moved on, like many of Germany's political exiles, to France where he was able to attend school, in the south of the country, despite the fact that he and his mother were illegal immigrants. By 1941 mother and son were in Paris, which since June 1940 had been in the occupied north of France. In 1941 Carlo was excluded from his Paris secondary school on account of his \\"political activities\\". He had been involved in a strike and / ir in distributing political leaflets. At aroun d this time - if not earlier - he joined the R√©sistance. His career as a resistance fighter came to an end on 8 March 1942 when he was arrested immediately after leaving a suitcase filled with explosives outside the Salle Wagram which had been hosting an anti-Soviet propaganda exhibition (\\"Le Bolchevisme contre l‚ÄôEurope\\"). A court martial show trial was conducted by the German occupation authorities in Paris between 7 and 14 April at which 25 of the 27 accused were condemned to death. The proceedings were apparently conducted according to German law, which precluded the death sentence for those under 18. Carlo Carlo Sch√∂nhaar was still only 17. Nevertheless, he was one of those condemned to death and was killed by firing squad, with the other 24 R√©sistance combattant comrades, on 17 April 1942 at Mont-Val√©rien. Eugen Sch√∂nhaar's wife, born Odette Pisler, was originally Swiss. By marrying a German she had, under Swiss law, lost her Swiss citizenship which made it dangerous to remain in Switzerland. After moving with her son to France from her parents' home in Lausanne she too joined the R√©sistance: she was arrested on 9 March 1942 just one day after her son. She then spent 17 days in the Sant√© Prison on the south side of Paris followed by a further six months held in Gestapo detention in Berlin, from where she was deported to the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in the damp flat countryside north of the German capital. Odette Sch√∂nhaar was among the camp survivors liberated by the Soviet army in April 1945. She may have returned to Paris after 1945 and worked again for the communist daily newspaper L'Humanit√©. The killer Much later it was determined that the killer had been a police officer called Bruno Sattler. After the war and the Nazi nightmare were over, on 11 August 1947, with Berlin divided into military zones of occupation, a clandestine operation was undertaken from the Soviet occupation zone which involved the kidnapping from what was becoming known as \\"West Berlin\\" of Sattler, who was smuggled across to the east and secretly sentenced to life imprisonment. He was officially (but incorrectly) declared dead in 1949. Although Eugen Sch√∂nhaar and his three fellow victims became heroic figures in the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in 1949 as the German Democratic Republic / \\"East Germany\\"), the kidnapping and sentencing of their killer never made it to the national schools curriculum. Sattler served his sentence and on 15 October 1972 died in prison, aged 74, under circumstances that were never entirely clear. His youngest daughter, who had been born in 1942 and with her family had escaped to West Germany after a final cuddle from her father in 1945, grew up convinced that her father was a good man. After reunification she was keen to press for his rehabilitation. She was able to undertake extensive research in the scrupulously maintained files that the East German security services had carefully compiled and maintained during the intervening decades, and forced to accept not just that her father was the man who had murdered \\"John Schehr\\" and his comrades, but that this had been just the first in a succession of escalating atrocities for which her father had been responsible during the twelve Nazi years during what was, in its own terms, a highly successful career as a senior Gestapo officer. Celebration After the Second World War Eugen Sch√∂nhaar's earthly remains were disinterred and reburied in the \\"Gedenkst√§tte der Sozialisten\\" (area set aside for heroes of socialism)) in East Berlin's Central Cemetery. Three memorial stones commemorating the killing of Sch√∂nhaar and his three fellow victims have stood on the spot where they were killed at the Sch√§ferberg / Kilometerberg (hill) in Berlin-Wannsee since 1954.Neues Deutschland, 2 February 1954. A trawler was named \\"Eugen Sch√∂nhaar\\" during the early 1970s At least one street in Berlin has been named in his honour and in 2016 a Stolperstein was laid in the town of his birth, Esslingen, commemorating Eugen Sch√∂nhaar, alongside another commemorating his son who later also became a victim of the National Socialists.

In 1896, Rankin also won first prize in a contest for artful embroidered book covers, run by Studio International magazine, with her Podley. She also won first prize in a contest run by the same magazine in 1902, for a color illustration titled Sir Esp√©rance. In 1899, her watercolour titled \\"A Swimming Match\\" was exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh. Beyond these very early efforts, Rankin worked primarily with colour woodcuts. Early examples of her prints, such as The Striped Rocks (1920) or Sligneach, Iona (1921), show her using Japanese wood block techniques. Later landscape works, such as Martyr's Bay, Iona and Iona, from 1924 and 1927 respectively, use a more conventional approach. After a spell in Edinburgh, Rankin worked in London for a time. She returned to Scotland in 1913 and lived at Abbotsbrae in Crieff before returning to London in 1922. She lived in Kensington for the rest of her life. Rankin was a member of the Colour Woodcut Society and from 1924 to 1935 exhibited regularly with the Society of Graver Painters in Colour. During her career she had some twenty-four pieces shown at the Royal Scottish Academy and also exhibited with the Society of Women Artists, and the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts.

When racing as a two-year-old in Australia he showed considerable promise as he won one race and finished second in both The Schweppervescence and Champagne Stakes. After being gelded and sent to race in Hong Kong he ran well as a three-year-old, making steady improvement and ending his second season with a win in the Lion Rock Trophy. In the following season he was the dominant racehorse in Hong Kong, taking the Hong Kong Classic Mile, Hong Kong Classic Cup, Hong Kong Derby and Chairman's Trophy but sustained a fatal injury in the Champions Mile. He was posthumously named Hong Kong Horse of the Year. Background Rapper Dragon was a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred by Eduardo Cojuangco at his Gooree Park stud at Mudgee, New South Wales. Cojuangco named the colt Street Rapper and sent him into training with Gai Waterhouse. He was sired by Street Boss, a sprinter who won the Bing Crosby Handicap and the Triple Bend Handicap in 2008. The best of his other progeny have included Cathryn Sophia, Danza (Arkansas Derby) and The Quarterback (Newmarket Handicap). Rapper Dragon's dam Swing Dance was an unraced half-sister to the Queen of the Turf Stakes winner Amanpour and a female-line descendant of Natalma. Racing career 2014/2015: two-year- old season Street Rapper began his track career at Randwick Racecourse where he finished fourth in a 1000 metres race on 24 January 2015 and seventh in the Listed Lonhro Plate three weeks later. On 5 March at Wyong he recorded his first success as he won a two-year-old handicap by more than three lengths at odds of 2.6/1. After finishing runner-up in the Group 3 The Schweppervescence at Rosehill Racecourse he ended his first campaign by running second to Pasadena Girl in the Group 1 Champagne Stakes at Randwick on 18 April. 2015/2016: three-year-old season Sha Tin Racecourse, the location for most of Beauty Generation's races At the end of his first season Street Rapper was bought privately by the trainer John Moore on behalf of Albert Hung Chao Hong and was exported to Hong Kong where the colt was gelded and renamed Rapper Dragon. All but the first of his Hong Kong races took place at Sha Tin Racecourse. Rapper Dragon finished unplaced in his first two races for his new connections before narrowly winning a minor handicap race over 1400 metres on 21 February. In this race he was partnered for the first time by Jo√£o Moreira, who became his regular jockey. The gelding began to make steady progress, finishing second under 128 pounds in the Viva Pataca Handicap and then winning the Primula Handicap over 1600 metres on 28 March. In the Sports For All Handicap on 16 April he came from last place 400 metres from the finish to win going away by one and a half lengths from Romantic Touch. On his final appearance of the season the gelding was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Lion Rock Trophy on 29 May and started favourite ahead of Helene Paragon (Hong Kong Stewards' Cup). After being settled in mid-division, Rapper Dragon made rapid progress on the outside in the straight, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from Beauty Only. Moreira said that the gelding appeared to be an outstanding prospect commenting \\"I will win a Group 1 on Rapper Dragon ‚Äì I would never normally say that about any young horse, but I am so confident that this horse will win a Group 1. Mentally, he is not 100 per cent yet and look what he is doing\\". 2016/2017: four-year-old season Jo√£o Moreira, Rapper Dragon's regular jockey Rapper Dragon was scheduled to begin his four-year-old campaign in the Sha Tin Trophy on 23 October but was withdrawn from the race after sustaining an injury to his right hind leg. He resumed his season in December when he finished fifth behind Blizzard in the Flying Dancer Handicap. In the Hong Kong Classic Mile for four-year-olds on 22 January 2017 he started the 1.1/1 favourite against thirteen opponents headed by Pakistan Star, Beauty Generation and Eagle Way (Queensland Derby). After racing just behind the leaders Rapper Dragon accelerated into the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Seasons Bloom. Moore commented \\"I've been telling the press for weeks that this is the cleanest-winded horse I've had in the stable for donkeys' years and, from that point of view, he was very easy to get fit... I didn‚Äôt expect that he would win that easily\\". Four weeks later the gelding moved up to 1800 metres for the Hong Kong Classic Cup and was made the odds-on favourite in a fourteen-runner field which included Seasons Bloom, Pakistan Star, Beauty Generation and Eagle Way. He raced in mid-division before accelerating in the straight, taking the lead just over 200 metres from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths from Pakistan Star. On 19 March Rapper Dragon stepped up in distance again and started 0.8/1 favourite for the Hong Kong Derby over 2000 metres. Following his wins in the Mile and the Cup he was attempting to become the first horse to win all three legs of the Hong Kong Four-year-old Classic Series. The field included his old rivals Pakistan Star, Beauty Generation, Eagle Way and Seasons Bloom as well as the strongly fancied British import Gold Mount. In a race run in heavy rain, Rapper Dragon was among the leaders from the start, accelerated into the lead in the straight and came home one and three quarter lengths clear of Pakistan Star. After the race Moore said \\"This is a really classy animal, he's done everything right, he progressed through the classes, today was the grand final and we won it... there was a moment or two there when he probably was in a tight position but he extricated himself and hit the line like he usually does ‚Äì really, really strongly.\\" Rapper Dragon was then dropped back to 1600 metres on 9 April for the Chairman's Trophy in which he faced a strong field of older horses including Werther (Queen Elizabeth II Cup), Beauty Only, Helene Paragon, Blazing Speed (Champions & Chater Cup) and Designs On Rome. Starting the 0.6/1 favourite he raced in second place behind Contentment before taking the lead in the straight and held off the strong late challenge of Beauty Only to win by half a length. On 7 May Rapper Dragon started odds-on favourite for the Champions Mile. He began to struggle approaching half way and was pulled up by Moreira. He was immediately transferred to the track's veterinary hospital where he was euthanised after an examination revealed a major and complicated pelvic fracture. At the Hong Kong Jockey Club Champion Awards in July 2017 Rapper Dragon was posthumously named Champion Middle- distance Horse, Most Popular Horse of the Year and Hong Kong Horse of the Year. In the 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Rapper Dragon was rated the fifty-ninth best horse in the world with a rating of 119.

She is the author of El mito del var√≥n sustentador (The Myth of the Male Sustainer), as well as about 30 articles and books about her research. Since the enactment of the , she has been one of the three expert members of the State Council for the Participation of Women. Research career Laura Nu√±o holds a PhD in Political Science from the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM). Her doctoral thesis, which she defended in 2008, deals with the origins and consequences of the sexual division of labor. This research, which was subsequently published under the title El mito del var√≥n sustentador, delves into the roots of the sexual division of labor and defends the thesis of how the incorporation of women into public space represents one of the greatest revolutions of the 20th century, although maintaining that it is still incomplete, since new gender roles in the public space have not been accompanied by a reformulation of traditional ones in the private space. This is the reason why the author considers this division one of the main sources of gender inequality. In addition to this work, Nu√±o has participated in almost 20 investigations, including \\"Derecho fundamental a la educaci√≥n: derechos, ciudadan√≠a y libertad\\" (Fundamental Right to Education: Rights, Citizenship, and Freedom), \\"Debates te√≥ricos sobre la prostituci√≥n; un an√°lisis de los fundamentos filos√≥ficos, hist√≥ricos y legales\\" (Theoretical Debates on Prostitution: An Analysis of the Philosophical, Historical, and Legal Foundations), and \\"An√°lisis de la agenda p√∫blica en Espa√±a desde la perspectiva de g√©nero: las demandas de las mujeres hacia el sistema pol√≠tico\\" (Analysis of the Public Agenda in Spain from a Gender Perspective: The Demands of Women Towards the Political System). She is currently part of the research team of the project \\"El Derecho Constitucional ante la crisis\\" (Constitutional Law in the Face of the Crisis). In 2013, along with social researchers Manuel Tamayo S√°enz and Ernesto Carrillo Barroso, she published \\"La formaci√≥n de la agenda p√∫blica. An√°lisis comparado de las demandas de hombres y mujeres hacia el sistema pol√≠tico en Espa√±a\\" (The Formation of the Public Agenda. Comparative Analysis of the Demands of Men and Women Towards the Political System in Spain). In this work, the public agenda is examined by applying gender perspective as a methodological and analytical tool for the first time. Nu√±o worked as an Applied Social Research Technician at the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol√≥gicas (CIS) from January 1991 to October 2002, after which she requested a leave of absence to dedicate herself to her teaching and research activities full-time. Teaching, institutional, and activist career Nu√±o began her teaching career at the Complutense University of Madrid in 1991 and is currently a Professor of Political Science at King Juan Carlos University, where she heads the Gender Equality Observatory, the Gender Studies Chair of the Institute of Public Law, the Degree in Gender Equality, and the University Master's Degree in Interdisciplinary Gender Studies, as well as being part of the management team of the program \\"G√©nero y pol√≠ticas de igualdad entre mujeres y hombres\\" (Gender and Politics of Equality Between Women and Men). Under her direction, the Equality Observatory received the Award in 2015 in recognition of its work and commitment to the elimination of violence against women. That year, and through the Observatory on which it depends, she promoted the constitution of the URJC's Equality Unit that formulated the institution's first Equality Plan. With Manuela Carmena and Felipe Llamas in Madrid at the Multisector Academic Program Conference to Prevent Female Genital Mutilation, 2017 She participates as a teacher in the Degree in Gender Equality, in the official master's degrees of \\"Interdisciplinary Studies of Equality\\" (URJC) and \\"Senior Management\\" (), and in some postgraduate programs such as the Master's Degree in Law and Human Development Perspective of Gender (Supreme Court of Justice of Nicaragua), Master in Management and Leadership (Miguel Escalera Training and Employment Foundation), Master in Sexology and Gender (SexPol Foundation), Master in Gender and Politics of Equality between Women and Men (FOREM), and Master in International Cooperation and Development in Latin America.

The response is therapy-specific, occurring independently of cancer type or stage.  Background  All cancer treatment modalities (e.g., chemotherapy, targeted drugs, radiation and surgery) trigger systemic and local effects in the treated subject (i.e., the host). These include a rapid elevation in the levels of circulating cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and enzymes accompanied by acute mobilization and tumor homing of bone-marrow derived cells. These therapy-induced effects have the potential to facilitate tumor growth and spread, counteracting the beneficial effects of therapy. Thus, the host response to cancer therapy creates a paradoxical situation in which the desired therapeutic effect of treatment is reduced by its side effect on host cells. The balance between these two opposing activities determines the overall efficacy and outcome of treatment.  Host response to different treatment modalities for cancer   Host response to chemotherapy  Chemotherapies, including alkylating agents, microtubule inhibitors, antimetabolites and antibiotics, represent a major systemic therapeutic modality for many cancers. These agents induce death in rapidly dividing cells thus targeting tumor cells, but at the same time damaging healthy tissue. Consequently, non-malignant host cells activate wound healing and inflammatory mechanisms to repair chemotherapy-induced damage. These repair mechanisms have the potential to exacerbate tumor promoting processes such as angiogenesis and metastasis. In mouse tumor models, different chemotherapy types induce a rapid mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells that home to the tumor site where they promote angiogenesis. In addition, a variety of immune cell types, such as myeloid progenitors and macrophages, are recruited to the tumor site in a chemotherapy-dependent manner, an effect that enhances metastasis.  Host response to radiation therapy  Radiotherapy is a well- established treatment modality for several cancer types. However, relapses after radiotherapy are often more aggressive and associated with poor prognosis. Cumulative evidence shows that the host response to radiotherapy is a contributing factor to this effect. Tumors implanted in pre-irradiated tissue grow with slower kinetics, however, paradoxically exhibit enhanced invasive and metastatic properties, a phenomenon known as the ‚Äútumor bed effect‚Äù. This enhanced aggressiveness is attributed to radiation-induced modifications of the tumor microenvironment, including enhanced angiogenesis and recruitment of pro-metastatic bone marrow cells and macrophages  Host response to anti-angiogenic drugs  Anti-angiogenic drugs (or angiogenesis inhibitors) target the blood vessels required for tumor survival. The rationale behind this strategy is to starve the tumor of oxygen and nutrients, limiting its ability to grow. However, tumor hypoxia that ensues activates a range of compensatory mechanisms that sustain vascularization, leading to resistance to the anti-angiogenic drug. Many of these compensatory mechanisms involve host cells. For example, treating tumor-bearing mice with vascular- disrupting agents (that specifically target tumor-associated vessels) triggers an acute mobilization of circulating endothelial progenitor cells that home to tumor margins where they facilitate revascularization. In addition, various types of pro-angiogenic bone marrow-derived cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tumor-associated macrophages, and TIE2-expressing monocytes contribute to therapy resistance. In mouse tumor models, anti-angiogenic therapy causes an elevation in tumor-promoting cytokines and growth factors that in turn augment the invasive and metastatic potential of tumors.  Host response to surgery  Surgical resection of a tumor is one of the primary treatment modalities for cancer and can be curative especially for patients with early disease. However, there is evidence that tumor resection generates a permissive environment for tumor growth, in part, via host-mediated processes. As part of the wound healing process, surgical tissue trauma is rapidly followed by a cascade of inflammatory processes. Many of the growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix-modifying enzymes, and immune cells released during this process may also promote proliferation of residual tumor cells, angiogenesis and metastasis. For example, lungs are more prone to metastatic seeding after a surgical incision in the abdominal region of mice. This effect is due to increased expression and activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), an extracellular matrix remodeling enzyme produced at the hypoxic surgical site. In clinical settings, elevated levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, bone marrow-derived cells as well as circulating factors with known roles in angiogenesis and tumor progression have been reported in response to major surgery in comparison to minimal surgery.  Clinical implications  Characterizing the host response to cancer therapy in patients has clinical implications especially in the field of personalized medicine (also known as precision medicine) and biomarker discovery. Experimental studies have shown that combining conventional cancer therapies with agents that selectively block therapy-induced factors improves treatment efficacies.

It lives in symbiosis with the Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), consuming the crab's developing eggs. In 1980 it was implicated in the collapse of the Dungeness crab fishery in central California. Ecology The planktonic larva of the worm settles on a suitable crab host and encysts on the exoskeleton. Carcinonemertes errans is the first species in its genus to be found on a single host species. The worm has a permanent symbiotic relationship with its host crab but it is not a parasite as it does not feed directly on the crab but is instead an egg-predator. In male crabs, and in non-breeding female crabs, the worm may live in the axils of the limbs and encyst. After mating, the mature female crab stores the sperm for several months, before releasing a batch of fertilised eggs onto her abdomen, where she tucks them under the tail flap. At this stage, the ribbon worm migrates to the mass of eggs and feeds on the developing embryos. If the worm larvae happen to settle on the exoskeleton of a brooding female crab, they can move immediately to the underside of the abdominal flap and metamorphose within 48 hours into juvenile worms. When settling, the larvae are gregarious, settling preferentially on already infected crabs. It has been found that the worm is adversely affected by a lowering of the water salinity. Crabs in estuaries show an estuarine gradient, with crabs nearest the ocean carrying more worms than those further upstream. Effect on the Dungeness crab industry The Dungeness crab industry is an important fishery on the Pacific coast, with worth $170 million being harvested in 2014. In 1980, the central California fishery was badly affected; Carcinonemertes errans was implicated, with 50% of the crabs' eggs produced each year being predated.

It proved popular and was also used to train pilots in ridge lift flying and set several national duration records. Development In 1939 there was a call from the Aeroclub of the fhe Technical University for a two- seat glider on which intermediate level pilots could learn the skills required for aerotowing. Ern≈ë Rubik responded with the F-11 G√≥lya (Stork) built, like several of his designs, by Aero Ever Kft. Its first flight was on 9 May 1940. A combination of flight test results and tightening regulations lead to three more prototypes, the R-11a, R-11b and R11b1. Details of the differences between them are sparse but it was the R-11b, renamed the Cimbora that went into production in 1941. Design R-11b Cimbora in 2015, winch-launching The R-11 was a glider with a high, swept, strut-braced wing. The half-wings were built around two spars. Swept at 7.5¬∞, they had constant chord out to rounded tips. Slotted ailerons occupied more than half the span. The wings were supported centrally over the fuselage by a longitudinal pair of inward-leaning steel N-struts from the upper fuselage longerons, joined at their tops and braced outboard by a pair of steel struts on each side from the lower fuselage longerons to the wing spars. On the R-11a G√≥lya, these were V-struts but the R-11b had instead a near-parallel pair, splaying outwards a little from top to bottom. Apart from rounded upper decking the ply-covered fuselage was flat- sided, built around longerons and frames. The student's cockpit was under the wing leading edge with a removable cover incorporating a windscreen and the instructor sat under the rear wing in an open cockpit over the centre of gravity (cg) with its own windscreen, accessed via an upwardly hinged upper fuselage section. On the underside a landing skid ran from the nose to below the front of the instructor's cockpit. Aft of it, but ahead of the cg. there was a semi-exposed monowheel. The fuselage tapered rearwards to the tail, where the R-11's strut-braced tailplane was placed on top of the fuselage just ahead of a small, tapered fin. The tailplane and elevators together were tapered in plan out to rounded tips. The full, rounded, balanced rudder reached down to the keel, behind a small tailskid. Operational history As well as providing aerotowing training, the Cimbora was used to train pilots in ridge-flying techniques, a style which encouraged duration record attempts. The longest in Hungary lasted 25 hr 7 min, flown by G√©za Vass and Endre Lacza in August 1948. R-11bs remained in use into the 1950s. A 1984 replica, HA-5035, based at Buda√∂rs Airport, remained active at least to 2016 but is currently deregistered.

History and design  St. Augustine Historical Restoration and Preservation Commission (later renamed the Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board) bought the plot of land between the Casa del Hidalgo, once a tourism office run by the Spanish Government, and the Pan American Center to build a garden as a symbolic link between the shared Hispanic heritage of Spain, Latin America, and Florida. Commission member Elizabeth Towers established and led the Hispanic Garden Committee in order to raise the $45,000 needed to complete the garden. The Committee held many fundraising events, including fashion shows, teas, and art auctions. They also sold small items including jewelry, letter openers, key rings, coins, and paper bulls donated by the Spanish Pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair. Philanthropist, Great Floridian, and Florida Women's Hall of Fame inductee Jessie Ball duPont donated over $30,000 to the garden project. Lee Schmoll and Drusilla Gjoerloff, the only two female landscape architects working in Florida at the time, were chosen to design the garden. The design was inspired by plazoletas, classic Spanish gardens like ones seen at the Alhambra Palace. It was laid out in a trapezoid, measuring 76 by 82 feet. The addition of an arbor on the eastern end gave the garden a more square appearance. The arbor was decorated with Confederate jasmine and Cherokee roses to act as a shaded walkway and rest area. There was no grass in the garden in order to maintain a historically accurate appearance. Plants included in the design were cabbage palms, kumquats, marigolds, yaupon holly, and Burfordi holly. Each of these plants was chosen because it was native to northeast Florida or was introduced by the Spaniard settlers upon their arrival in the 16th century. Sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington created and donated a bronze sculpture of Queen Isabella riding a donkey that was placed in the center of the garden on a raised pedestal. A square pool was placed underneath the statue, and is surrounded by an inlaid pebble mosaic that was inspired by Spanish design.  Quadricentennial and dedication  Anna Hyatt Huntington Plaque at the Hispanic Garden The Hispanic Garden Committee sought to have the Hispanic Garden completed by the city's 400th anniversary on September 8, 1965. Although not completed, the garden was officially dedicated on September 5, 1965 to be part of the celebrations. The project was officially completed two years later and was rededicated on May 2, 1967. Attendees included Senator Spessard Holland, Senator George Smathers, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, Ambassador Alfonso Merry del Val, Director General Angel Sagaz, and Governor Haydon Burns. The project was officially completed and rededicated on May 2,1967. At that time, the name was changed from Hispanic Garden to Hispanic Plaza, which they felt better represented its function. Archbishop Joseph Hurley and St. Augustine Mayor John D. Bailey attended this dedication ceremony and the Archbishop blessed the garden.  Current use  Special Event at the Hispanic Garden Between 2000 and 2003, the bronze statue of Queen Isabella was removed from the Hispanic Garden while an archaeological dig was underway. The dig uncovered American Indian, British, Spanish, and American artifacts. There were talks at this time on building over the garden site. After 2003, a new fence was erected around the garden, addressing previous concerns of vandalism within the space. The city of St. Augustine had not budgeted enough money to complete the upkeep and restoration project of 2003, so the owner of the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park, David Drysdale, donated necessary funds. His mother Evelyn Drysdale was a member of part of the 1965 Hispanic Garden Committee. Today, the garden is owned and maintained by the St. Augustine Foundation, Inc. It is closed to the public but is opened special city events, such as the St. Augustine Easter Week Festival and knighting ceremonies.

Prior to World War I, England published many articles related to the field of monetary economics and economic fluctuations, challenging the common stereotype that the focus of early female economists was primarily on gender issues or labor economics. From 1912 to 1915, she presented her analysis of entrepreneurial promotion of new enterprises as the cause of crises in the business cycle in four major articles in the Quarterly Journal of Economics and the Journal of Political Economy. She was an important critic of Irving Fisher's monetary theory of fluctuations.  Biography  England was a native of Lincoln, Nebraska. She graduated from Nebraska Wesleyan University, Lincoln, and married a classmate, who became a farmer. In 1906, England received her P.h.D from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. At university, she studied with William George Langworthy Taylor, who published the ‚ÄúKinetic Theory of Economic Crises‚Äù in 1904 in the University of Nebraska University Studies. After England graduated from the school, she taught economics as an assistant professor there. The majority of England's works were published before 1915. Her main scholarly foci were monetary economics and economic fluctuations. Her work on crises and cycles appeared after the publication of Irving Fisher's Purchasing Power of Money in 1911. During this remarkable period of research on monetary and cycle theory, England published several articles such as Fisher's Theory of Crises: A Criticism in 1912 and An Analysis of the Crisis Cycle in 1913. Her work was recognized by several leading economists such as Fisher and Joseph Schumpeter. Although England's research output and her publication of economic articles was on a par with Professors in the same department, she was never promoted due to the political atmosphere of the department during World War I. In 1920, she left the university.  Research  Minnie Throop England's dissertation ‚ÄúChurch Government and Church Control‚Äù was never published, and was unrelated to her later scholarship. England's main scholarly interest was monetary economics, economic fluctuations, and analysis of promotion as the cause of crises. In England's early research, her work was published in monographs at the University of Nebraska University Studies. During 1912 to 1915, she published several articles in the Quarterly Journal of Economics and the Journal of Political Economy.  \\"Statistical Inquiry into the Influence of Credit Upon the Level of Price\\" (1907)  The main focus of this paper was to \\"determine the relationship between credit and short-time fluctuations between gold and prices\\". The paper was divided into three parts: the rise of price, the fall of price, and an analysis of the movement of commodity prices. This article was reviewed by Irving Fisher in 1908 in Yale Review, and Fisher commented on the novelty of the method used by England. Fisher noted that England's method of measurement \\"consists in noting the years of lowest and highest points for prices, clearings, loans, note circulation, deposits, etc. It is found that beginning with the lowest point of depression following a crisis, clearings which are taken as a good index of the amount of credit used in transactions begin to increase before the commodity prices rather than the increase of prices being a cause of the increase in clearings\\".  \\"Fisher's Theory of Crises: A Criticism\\" (1912)  In this article, England critiqued the theory of Crises in The Purchasing Power of Money by Irving Fisher. She held that ‚Äúthe greater part of the literature on the subject of crises is disheartening reading because of the vagueness of the terms employed and the care with which the crucial question is evaded, ‚Äì what brings prosperity to a halt?... An examination of five crises in Germany and six in England does not bring to light any uniform tendency for interest as a cost of production to lag behind prices,‚Äù. She also stated that ‚Äúsometimes a crisis occurs even though virtual [i.e. real] interest rates are abnormally low, as in 1873 in Germany and England, or in 1900 in the latter country‚Äù and that ‚Äúprosperity may continue for several years after virtual interest rates are high, as in the crisis of 1883 in England‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt looks as if it could more properly be said that the rapid rise of virtual interest rates was due to the stoppage of prosperity, than that the check to prosperity comes from the rise of virtual interest rates‚Äù.  \\"An Analysis of the Crisis Cycle\\" (1913)  In this paper, England's argues that the \\"industrial cycle was driven by the demand for goods. Increased demand for goods during the prosperity phase of the cycle was due to promotion, that is, from efforts to procure capital goods to enlarge industries and to establish new ones. The demand [for] new and expanding companies for capital goods raised the price of such goods and hence the profits of their producers. Increased demand for consumption of goods was a consequence of prosperity, not its cause\\". Furthermore, she holds that there are three possible causes for an industrial crisis: (1) \\" investors have taken all the risks they care to assume\\".; (2) \\"banks refuse to increase their loans further given their capital and reserves\\"; or (3) ‚Äúbecause distrust has been awakened regarding the future course of enterprise,‚Äù that is, a revision of expectations of future profitability.  \\"Promotion as the Cause of Crises\\" (1915)  In this article, England attempts to show that \\"even when prosperity is not interrupted by extraneous causes such as natural calamities (crop failure, fires, floods, and so on) or by political disturbances, threat of wars, and the like, active promotion, the cause of rising prosperity, still sets in operation forces which lead to a financial crisis, tend to check promotion activity, and cause a return to a condition of depression such as characterized the beginning of the period\\". England argues that crises are the price of progress, which means that the more rapid the progress, the more severe the crises. Her theory of promotion is similar to Schumpeter's view of the role of innovating entrepreneurs in cycles and development.

Background The English East India Company captured the territories of the Nawab of Bengal during the Seven Years' War and refused to pay taxation and tribute to the Great Moghul. This annexation caused Shah Alam II to wage the Bengal War in 1759. Although the Battle of Patna (1758), Battle of Chinsurah (1758) and Battle of Fort St. David (1758) were already fought. Campaign Shah Alam II was joined by Mir Qasim and most of the battles of the Bengal War took place around the city of Patna whose leaders Ramnarian was an ally of the East India Company was defeated in 1759. In 1760 Shah Alam II was routed by John Caillaud, and Miran (son of Mir Jafar). In 1761 Shah Alam II was also joined by the Rohillas, Durrani's and the Nawab Vizier (Grand Vizier) Shuja-ud-Daula whom had been a belligerent in the victory against the Maratha Confederacy at the Third Battle of Panipat. Together they marched towards Murshidabad; compelled again to retreat in defeat. They then besieged Patna, but was beaten off by Capt. Knox‚Äôs force. Shah Alam II was taken prisoner by Major Camac, 1761, in Bihar; and allowed to retire to Awadh where he was crowned emperor again. From there he planned further expeditions against Bengal Subah with the help of Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula. But perhaps his most formidable subject during the Bengal War was Mir Qasim. Together they formed a coalition led by the Great Moghul himself at the Battle of Buxar against the East India Company's Hector Munro of Novar. Shah Alam II, whom would later become a pensioner of the British East India Company in 1765. Aftermath Shah Alam II did manage to capture and hold Bihar before becoming a pensioner of the English. John Caillaud had set three official seals to document expressing an intent to kill Shah Alam II, while he had the Mughal Crown Prince, allegations that Caillaud would later strongly deny.John Caillaud at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The English East India Company waged a campaign to overthrow Shuja-ud-Daula.

Based in Los Angeles, it was formed on November 16, 2015 by Tim Leiweke & his business partner, Irving Azoff. Leiweke is the company's chief executive officer. History & Business Developments The company's biggest project is its redevelopment of the former KeyArena in Seattle, in part in preparation for the Seattle Kraken, the city's new National Hockey League team. The new arena, renamed Climate Pledge Arena via a naming rights deal with Amazon will also be home to the WNBA's Seattle Storm. On December 4, 2017, the Seattle City Council voted 7‚Äì1 to approve a memorandum of understanding with the Oak View Group for the redevelopment, which will build a new subterranean arena on the existing site while retaining the historical landmarked roof and three exterior walls. Demolition and construction for the new arena began in 2018 and will be fully completed in 2021. The company was competing against a rival proposal by Chris Hansen. On December 7, the NHL's board of governors agreed to consider an application for an expansion team from Seattle, with an expansion fee set at $650 million. The Seattle ownership group is represented by David Bonderman and Jerry Bruckheimer. On February 20, Mayor Jenny Durkan launched an NHL campaign during her State of the Union and announced that the Oak View Group would be initiating a season ticket drive on March 1, 2018. Upon completion, OVG will manage the new Seattle Center Arena. The group is also involved in the Belmont Park Arena's development with the New York Islanders. In December 2017, New York Arena Partners (a venture of the Islanders, Oak View Group, and Sterling Equities) won a bid to construct a new, 18,000-seat arena and mixed-used district at Belmont Park, beating a competing proposal by New York City FC for a new soccer stadium. The new arena is projected to be completed in time for the 2021-22 season. In 2016, Oak View Group announced a \\"Arena Alliance\\" of independent arena which includes arenas such as AT&T; Center (San Antonio), Scotiabank Arena (Toronto), Amalie Arena (Tampa Bay), BB&T; Center (Ft. Lauderdale), Bankers Life Fieldhouse (Indianapolis), Chase Center (San Francisco), PPG Paints Arena (Pittsburgh), KeyBank Center (Buffalo), The Forum (Los Angeles), Golden 1 Center (Sacramento), Little Caesars Arena (Detroit), Madison Square Garden (New York), Pepsi Center (Denver), State Farm Arena (Atlanta), Prudential Center (Newark), Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse (Cleveland), Rogers Arena (Vancouver), Enterprise Center (St. Louis), United Center (Chicago) Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia) and Xcel Energy Center (St. Paul). In 2016, the company acquired Venues Today, a trade publication for the live entertainment industry. In 2017, the company purchased Pollstar, a trade publication for the concert industry. In 2018, it was announced that Oak View Group and the University of Texas at Austin had agreed to build a new $338 million arena for the Texas Longhorns men's and women's basketball programs to replace the Frank Erwin Center. In February 2019, it was announced that Oak View Group had become the arena manager of Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In June 2019, it was announced that the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and Oak View Group plan to build a privately-funded arena on tribal land in downtown Palm Springs, California with the intent of the arena serving as the home ice for the Kraken's American Hockey League affiliate.

Built about 1876 in the Second Empire style, it was restyled after a fire in the early 20th century to its present Colonial Revival appearance to a design by Vermont architect Lewis Newton. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 for its architectural significance. Description and history The Quincy Hotel is located in the center of the village of Enosburg Falls, on the north side of Depot Street between Vermont Route 108N and Archambault Street. It is located across the street from the former railroad right-of-way of the Missisquoi Railroad, now the Missisquoi Valley Rail Trail. The building is a roughly U-shaped wood frame structure, three stories in height, with a low- pitch hip roof and clapboarded exterior. A single-story porch extends across the nine-bay front facade, supported by Tuscan columns. It extends beyond the building to the right side to form a porte-cochere. Three-story wings, later additions from its original construction, extend to the rear. The hotel was built about 1876, following the arrival of the railroad in the village, an event which resulted in population and economic growth. It was built by B.J. Kendall, owner of a local liniment manufacturer. Originally Second Empire in style, its third floor, which originally housed a ballroom space, was extensively damaged by fire in 1923. The owners responded by retaining Vermont architect Louis Newton to replace the third floor and transform it into the then-popular Colonial Revival style. The building's usage mirrored the level of railroad activity through the town, declining to a low level once the railroad stopped running in 1984.

The film tells the story of Joy, a Filipino-American woman, her struggle with sex and love addiction, and her recovery through music and platonic friendship. The film also stars John Hawkes and Melissa Leo, and is co-written by Sarah Adina Smith and Mark Duplass. The film was produced by Duplass Brothers Productions and distributed by Orion Classics. The film premiered at SXSW and received special jury recognition for the LUNA Gamechanger Award. Background In an LA Times interview, deGuzman disclosed that she contacted Mark Duplass via Twitter DM about the initial script for Unlovable, which she first wrote as a pilot 30 days into a 12-step program for sex and love addiction. Duplass described her as \\"writing at the funeral, basically. It was all alive, and it was a learning process.\\"  Plot  Joy is a sex and love addict. At the onset of the film, she tries to kill herself by taking pills and drinking NyQuil, but fails. She is in a questionable relationship with her boyfriend Ben who also works with her as an actor on a children's show, and who does not treat her well. Joy is constantly on the search for something to fill the emptiness in her soul, but nothing ever seems to be enough, whether it be drugs, alcohol, or sex. After Ben cancels plans with Joy, she gets drunk and has sex with another man. Finding pierogies in the refrigerator, the telltale sign that Joy went on a bender the night before, Ben breaks up with her and tells her to get help. Joy goes to a sex and love addicts meeting where she meets Maddie, who she tries to get to be her sponsor. Initially, Maddie declines, but she does give Joy her phone number. That night, Ben tells Joy to move out. In response, she goes out and then wakes up underneath a stranger in his house. The house is full of other men, asleep in various states of undress, who were apparently there for a Bachelor party. Joy finds a stack of photographs of herself from the night and is disgusted with what she sees. The first man offers Joy money for her services, assuming she is a prostitute. As she leaves, she gets a call from her boss, saying that she has been fired. Distressed, she calls Ben and then her parents, but no one answers. She calls Maddie, who comes to pick her up and then agrees to sponsor her, so long as she goes 30 consecutive days sober from sex and romance. As Joy struggles to get sober, she follows Maddie's suggestion of adopting a hobby and finds herself taking over the drum kit in the garage that belongs to Maddie's awkward brother, Jim. As the two of them create music together, a secret friendship grows.

Oil on canvas, it measures 70.1 √ó 110 cm, and is held in a private collection.  Description  The painting portrays a storm sea near the rocks vanishing in the gloom. The raging sea merges with the stormy sky. The lightning strikes from behind heavy clouds. The waves splash against the high coast and flow down the rocks. The atmosphere of the storm and wrath of the sea is depicted with such power that the spectator can almost hear the crashing waves and the rolling thunder. On the left side of the foreground, you can see a boat with people trying to survive a shipwreck. One of them is pointing his hand towards the coast, the others are rowing, and the will to survive gives hope for the rescue of those who refused to succumb to the disaster. The dark colours prevail in the painting. Yet, there is a significant contrast between the impenetrable heavy clouds and their light-toned edges penetrated by moonshine. It is based on a combination of cold and warm grey, navy blue, and yellowish ochre tones. File:Fragment boat with people.jpg|Boat with people File:Fragment oblaka i molnii.jpg|Clouds and lightning File:Fragment sign on front.jpg|Signature on the front File:Fragment back sign.jpg|Signature on the back A fairly philosophical nature of the painting typical for the best pieces of art, the sky and the sea merging into one, and the flashes of scarlet lightning on the water are reminiscent of the works by British painter William Turner, yet another great master of romanticist marine art.

Dostoevsky. Concordance Dictionary of Journalism. These words are totally true for The Wrath Of The Seas as well, despite the fact that it was created 25 years after Fyodor Dostoevsky's article was published (1861). The painting has two signatures of the author, which is quite common for Ivan Aivazovsky. One of them is on the front next to the lower right corner and is made in black paint: ‚ÄúAivazovsky 1886‚Äù. The paint of the signature has the same crack patterns as the underlayer. The second author's signature is on the back of the painting at its upper right and is made with brown paint: ‚ÄúAivazovsky‚Äù. The work is in excellent shape.  Peculiarities of painterly manner  As he was creating the painting, the artist used a complex painting technique, including a preliminary drawing with an undercoat graphite pencil, a few paint coats of various textures and directions, scumble, and overtone, strokes of various shape, thickness, and length, and diverse textured compactions. The painting was made in several stages. The principal outline is made in large strokes of medium thickness. Then finer details are portrayed over the layer slightly touched by fading. The bright cloud edges are painted with bristly brushes in short strokes that depict their round shapes perfectly. The concluding outlines (webby sections of the foam dissolving in the waves, water flowing from the rocks, etc.) are painted in translucent bleach scumbles. The foam of the waves is depicted with fine floating zigzags that oftentimes thicken into diverse bunches (on brighter surfaces). The human figures in gliding blue, emerald green, red, and ochre strokes are portrayed in a generalised manner depicting a common zeal for survival.V.I. Tsitovich EXPERT AND ATTRIBUTION OPINION. ‚Äì P. 1-4.  Technology  The work is made on a thin rare medium-grained canvas with a light factory undercoat and is put on a key stretcher. The painter equally used this type of canvas for many other works. The painting microsampling by means of infrared spectroscopy, microchemical, emission, phosphorescent and thermochemical types of analysis established that the colour combination of the painting is most typical for Ivan Aivazovsky's works.

Clinical significance  In a topological transcriptome analysis, researchers profiled important proteins of the non-small cell lung cancer regulatory network and determined that TMEM125 exhibited different topological characteristics across cancerous and normal conditions, suggesting its criticality in lung cancer networks. This is consistent with post- translational modification analysis; TMEM125 phosphorylation suggests it may be involved in a signal transduction pathway or as a receptor protein. Additionally, its myristoylation sites suggests its involvement in signal transduction, apoptosis, and alternative extracellular protein export. TMEM125 was identified as a tetraspanin cell adhesion molecule enriched in oligodendrocytes, suggesting it may play a role in myelination. Additionally, its expression was not observed in differentiating oligodendrocytes in vitro, but was detected in oligodendrocytes from treated rat brains, which suggests its expression is regulated by the presence of axons.

The designer noted, \\"The main advantages of the cat ketch sail plan of the BEACHCOMBER 25 are its simplicity and ease of handling combined with good performance. The sails unfurl from the masts like window shades, controlled from the cockpit, with no need to go forward except to release mooring lines or haul up the anchor. Once the sails have been unfurled, you set up on the clew outhauls which also lead to the cockpit. A small winch is required in the case of the mainsail in order to obtain the desired degree of sail flatness. This is the last time you will have to touch the winch unless you reef or for the refinement of easing the outhaul for more sail draft off the wind.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Bayfield 25 *Bombardier 7.6 *Cal 25 *Cal 2-25 *Capri 25 *Catalina 25 *Catalina 250 *Dufour 1800 *Hunter 25.5 *Jou√´t 760 *Kelt 7.6 *MacGregor 25 *Merit 25 *Northern 25 *O'Day 25 *Sirius 26 *Tanzer 25 *US Yachts US 25 References Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts Category:Trailer sailers ","title":"Beachcomber 25"},{"id":"60072806","text":"Silences is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Adia Victoria.

Description and history The Stannard House is located on the north side of downtown Burlington, at the northwest corner of George and Pearl Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, with a gabled roof. Its main facade is four bays wide, with the bays asymmetrically placed around a centered entrance. The entrance is set in a recess, with a columned entablature and full-length sidelight windows. A two-story brick wing, also four bays in length, extends along George Street, recessed from the main block facade. The house was built in 1849-50 by Doctor Ashbel Pitkin, who lived here and also operated his medical practice here. It remained in use as a medical practice until about 1860, after which it became an owner-occupied boarding house. The house was briefly home to American Civil War general George Stannard between 1871 and 1873, and became known as the Stannard House as a result. Stannard made no significant alterations to the house, and was forced to sell it as a result of accounting problems related to his government service. It was converted into apartments in the 1950s. The building is one of the few in the immediate area to survive a major urban renewal project in the 2000s.

The rebels had amassed a force of 3000 men and had taken the town of Chatra which is located in the Chhota Nagpur region. Background Two companies of the Ramgarh Battalion which were stationed in Hazaribagh revolted against the British authorities as did other troops all across North India such as in Meerut. These sepoys fell under the leadership of local rebel leaders including Jaimangal Pandey and Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and formed a mukti vahini (people's army) and intended to overthrow the British authorities. The rebel force was planning to travel northwards to Rohtas were they would combine their forces with the rebel leader of North Bihar, Kunwar Singh. Battle The various British forces were sent in pursuit of the rebels as they traveled northwards through Hazaribagh until they also reached Chatra. The rebels received word that a clash was inevitable and fortified themselves within the town and in the process were harassing, robbing and looting the local people which caused many of them to assist the British forces. This plunderous behaviour also left the rebels open to a sudden attack. Major Smith drew a rough plan of the town and decided to attack from the South. The advanced guard located the main body of rebels and immediately a skirmish took place in the rice fields. As this progressed, various skirmishes also started to place throughout the town with both sides suffering heavy losses. In the end, the British forces started to attack the town from all flanks. The British took advantage of heavy tree cover on the outskirts of the town else they likely would have suffered even heavier losses. Two rebel leaders, Jai Mangal Pandey and Nadir Ali were captured and quickly hanged. Aftermath Two of the major rebel leaders, Vishwanath Shahdeo and Ganpat Rai managed to escape and continued to harass the British forces before being captured in 1858 and hanged.

Construction and route  Departure of the post train in Antsirane The gauge Decauville railway was built in 1900 from Antsirane (now Antsiranana) to the Tunisian Fountain (Fontaine Tunisienne) at today's STAR factory. It started at the port and ran on the Rue Gouraud and the Boulevard Bazeilles up to the Cercle Fran√ßais (now Suarez Art) and up the Boulevard Militaire. It turned into the Boulevard de Sakaramy at the height of Camp Lubert, from where it led past the present town hall to l'Octroi and the Tunisian Fountain. At the end of 1900, it was extended from the Tunisian Fountain via Antanamitara and Andranomanitra to the junction of today's road to Joffreville. Ox-drawn goods train on the Boulevard Bazeilles The route was designed by Captain Brunet to generally follow the terrain and thus to avoid large earthworks. At the Gorge of Antanamitara, a curve with a radius of only was needed. A deep cut and a bridge diagonally across the ravine had to be built. For track construction, Type No. 10 Decauville rails weighing 9.5 kg/m (19 lbs/yd) with 8 sleepers per long element. Due to delivery difficulties, rails with 7.5 kg/m (15 lbs/yd) were occasionally used in some sections, which had to be replaced at a later stage. Postal horse cart from Sakaramy to Camp d‚ÄôAmbre Construction of the initially long track was carried out by civilian entrepreneurs from Antsirane under the direction of engineer-captain F√©n√©on. Initially, the track was not ballasted, which excluded the use of a locomotive. The track was partly owned by the military administration and partly by private entities. Rails were laid onto the quays in the harbour, leading to various warehouses. The line was completed in 1904 to Sakaramy with a length of . The originally planned long extension to the military barracks at Camp d'Ambre in Joffreville at an altitude of about above sea level was never built.Digital Elevation Model data from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.  Operation  Decauville passenger carts The goods and passenger trains were initially pulled by oxen or large mules, respectively, and later in the lower part between the port and the Tunisian Fountain by steam locomotives. From 1904, animal traction was occasionally substituted by three steam locomotives. For the downhill gravity run, the cars were uncoupled and braked with two independently acting brakes. A road was built between Sakaramy and Camp d'Ambre in 1908 instead of extending the narrow-gauge railway. Due to a lack of maintenance of the tracks and steam locomotives as well as due to supply problems of spare parts and coal, the steam operation was discontinued in 1908, but animal-drawn trains continued to be operated. In 1911, trains were still running on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. During the war between 1914 and 1918, there was only one round trip per week. At least sections of the route were still used in 1925 and 1936.  Locomotives  Decauville steam engine At least three 0-4-0T Decauville steam locomotives, including the 3.5 t N¬∞ 342/1901, were used on the track. One of the three Decauville locomotives, La Mignonne, was presented the Exposition Universelle 1889 in Paris, before being exported to Madagascar. After its retirement, it was finally shipped to Asia.

In 1882, anti-European unrest following the British bombardment of Alexandria prompted the German government to send the M√∂we and the Habicht to rescue German and Austrian nationals in Egypt, taking around 150 of them from Ismailiya to Port Said. The M√∂we was the vessel which took the Imperial Commissioner for West Africa, Gustav Nachtigal, out to seek treaties of protection with local rulers in 1884. On 4 July 1884 the first such treaty was signed at Bagida on the Togo coast, which thereby became a German colony. On 14 July 1884 Nachtigal took the M√∂we to Bell-town (Douala) and signed a similar treaty, making Kamerun another colony of the German Empire. After this the M√∂we brought the German flag to Nigeria, Gabon, and Angola, before taking Nachtigal south to found the new colony of German South West Africa. In 1889 it was involved in the suppression of the Abushiri revolt in German East Africa. After 1895 it was used as a survey vessel coastal mapping German colonies in the Pacific and in German New Guinea. On 9 December 1905 the M√∂we was decommissioned. It was retained as a hulk in the German colony of Tsingtau on the Yellow Sea before finally being sold in 1910. Technical description The ship was 52.2m long, 8.9m breit and had a draught of 3.52m and a displacement of 845 tons. It was built using composite materials, with iron Ribs and wooden planks, covered with zinc plates. Two boilers produced the required steam, and a 3-cylinder engine provided 652kW (886PSi) of power to the 3.23m diameter propeller. It could make a top speed of 11.7 knots. With a coal stock of 100 tons and a speed of 11 knots it had an effective range of around 1230 nautical miles. There was no electrical equipment on board. It had a crew of 127. The ship was originally barquentine- rigged with a total sail surface of 847m¬≤. It as later converted to schooner- rigging with 361m¬≤ of sail. Armament The ship, also designated as an aviso, was initially equipped with one 15cm hoop gun and four smaller 12cm hoop guns. This armament was replaced in 1882 by five 12.5 cm hoop guns, later reduced to two in 1890. Furthermore, from 1882 there were five 3.7 cm hotchkiss guns on board. The maximum ammunition stock consisted of 115 rounds of 15 cm shells and 440 rounds of 12 cm shells. After conversion, 620 rounds of 12.5 cm shells could be carried, but from 1890, storage space for only 246 shells of this caliber was provided.

Friedlaender held appointments in two MIT departments as Professor of Civil Engineering and Economics for the class of 1941. Dr Friedlaender was seen as an authority in the field of public finance, with a speciality in transportation studies. The first woman to head one of MIT's five schools, she served as Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Science from 1984 to 1990.  Biography  Ann Fetter Friedlaender was born in Philadelphia in 1938. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from Radcliffe College in 1960. She married architect Stephan Friedlaender in December of the same year. Ann had two sons, Lucas Ferdinand and Nathaniel Mark. In 1964, she completed her PhD. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology with Albert Ando as her advisor. After graduation, Friedlaender worked for one year in Finland as a Fulbright lecturer. Friedlaender returned to the United States and taught at Boston College as a lecturer, receiving a promotion to an assistant professor, and then a promotion to professor from 1965 to 1974. In 1972, Friedlaender became a visiting professor at the MIT Department of Economics. In 1974, she was a professor at MIT's Department of Economics and Civil Engineering. She was appointed chair of the Economics department in 1983, becoming the first woman to head an academic department at MIT. She was named Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1984 to 1990. Friedlaender was also held positions off campus as a director of the Rand Corporation and of Conrail; a member of the American Economic Association, serving on the executive committee for two years; the chair of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (1978‚Äì1980; and an associate editor of Transportation Science for 14 years. Friedlaender died of cancer at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston on October 19, 1992. Her family established a Professorship after her death. Her brother Alexander Fetter, is Professor Emeritus of Physics and Applied Physics at Stanford University.  Contribution  Friedlaender was a scholar who published many professional and academic articles, influential books, and several monographs. One of the most well-known publications she wrote was The Interstate Highway System, which quickly made her an authority in the field of transportation economics at the age of 27. Her later works on the public finance and regulations of the public transportation system became fundamentals in these fields, and her analysis was considered in future regulation and policymaking. Her use of econometric modelling on the transport system was innovative for its time. Friedlaender's work with Spady, Transport Regulation: Equity, Efficiency, and Competition in the Rail and Trucking Industries, raised a lot of attention along with significant policy implications. Also, Friedlaender was very invested in improving learning materials for students. Friedlaender joined John F. Due as the second author and edited the fifth and later editions of Government Finance: Economics of the Public Sector in 1973, helping to improve the classic textbook published in seven editions from 1954‚Äì1981. The then provost, Professor John M. Deutch, described her as \\"one of the best deans to have graced MIT in its history,\\" adding, \\"She is a person of enormous wisdom and her accomplishments for the school have been just as enormous.\\" Aside from being productive in the academic field, Friedlaender was a member of the American Economic Association and the chair of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. There, she actively provided help and was committed to inspiring more women to choose academic careers and attend graduate school.

Metamorphic facies included are: BS = Blueschist facies, EC = Eclogite facies, PP = Prehnite- Pumpellyite facies, GS = Granulite facies, EA = Epidote-Amphibolite facies, AM = Amphibolite facies, GRA = Granulite facies, UHT = Ultra-High Temperature facies, HAE = Hornfels-Albite-Epidote facies, Hbl = Hornblende-Hornfels facies, HPX = Hornfels-Pyroxene Facies, San = Sanidinite facies A petrogenetic grid is a geological phase diagram that connects the stability ranges or metastability ranges of metamorphic minerals or mineral assemblages to the conditions of metamorphism. Experimentally determined mineral or mineral- assemblage stability ranges are plotted as metamorphic reaction boundaries in a pressure‚Äìtemperature cartesian coordinate system to produce a petrogenetic grid for a particular rock composition. The regions of overlap of the stability fields of minerals form equilibrium mineral assemblages used to determine the pressure‚Äìtemperature conditions of metamorphism. This is particularly useful in geothermobarometry. For example, suppose one came across a metapelitic rock containing chlorite, kaolinite, and quartz. As illustrated by the given petrogenetic grid on metapelites, one sees that such a rock can only form at relatively low pressures and temperatures. However, if it had carpolite instead of chlorite, then it would have formed at higher pressures, and if it had pyrophyllite instead of kaolinite, it would have formed at higher temperatures. Note, this assumes the rock has a KFMASH composition, since that is what the experimental data was created with. If the composition of the rock differs from this, then the figure is less accurate. Norman L. Bowen proposed the idea in 1940. At the time, he envisioned geologists eventually determining every possible metemorphic reaction and assembalge in nature, but realized that the magnitude of undertaking the necessary experiments was a huge task that would not be finished for a very long time. As such, modern petrogenetic grids are only partially complete. Depending on the level of precision and characterization needed, a petrogenetic grid may be simple, or it may be an extremely large system consisting of a hundred or more reactions. To the right is an example of a rather complex petrogenetic grid for metamorphosed pelitic rocks. It shows most of the important reactions that govern the development of aluminous mineral assemblages from the prehnite-pumpellyite facies to the granulite facies, as well as the blueschist facies and eclogite facies at higher pressures and the contact hornfels facies at lower pressures. As the rock undergoes higher temperatures and pressures, one can see it follow the classic Barrovian sequence from the chlorite zone to the biotite zone to the garnet zone to the staurolite zone.

Definition The input to pinwheel scheduling consists of a list of tasks, each of which is assumed to take unit time per instantiation. Each task has an associated positive integer value, its minimum repeat time (the minimum time from the start of one instantiation of the task to the next). Only one task can be performed at any given time. The desired output is an infinite sequence specifying which task to perform in each unit of time. Each input task should appear infinitely often in the sequence, with the largest gap between two consecutive instantiations of a task at most equal to the repeat time of the task. For example, the infinitely repeating sequence ... would be a valid pinwheel schedule for three tasks a, b, and c with repeat times that are at least 2, 4, and 4 respectively. Density If the task to be scheduled are numbered from 1 to n, let t_i denote the repeat time for task i. Then the density of a pinwheel scheduling problem is \\\\textstyle\\\\sum 1/t_i. For a solution to exist, it is necessary that the density is at most 1. This condition on density is also sufficient for a schedule to exist in the special case that all repeat times are multiples of each other (for instance, if all are powers of two), because in this case one can solve the problem using a disjoint covering system. Having density at most 1 is also sufficient when there are exactly two distinct repeat times. However, it is not sufficient in other cases. In particular, there is no schedule for three items with repeat times t_1=2, t_2=3, and t_3, no matter how large t_3 may be, even though the density of this system is only 5/6 + 1/t_3. Every instance of pinwheel scheduling with density at most 3/4 has a solution, and it has been conjectured that every instance with density at most 5/6 has a solution. Every instance with three distinct repeat times and density at most 5/6 does have a solution. Periodicity and complexity When there exists a solution, the solution can be assumed to be periodic, with a period at most equal to the product of the repeat times. However, it is not always possible to find a repeating schedule of sub-exponential length. With a compact input representation that specifies, for each distinct repeat time, the number of objects that have that repeat time, pinwheel scheduling is NP-hard. Applications Applications of pinwheel scheduling include scheduling communications between satellites and a ground station, scheduling maintenance of a collection of objects (such as oil changes for automobiles), computer processing of multimedia data, and contention resolution in real-time wireless computer networks.

After a distinguished career as a senior executive at the Rockefeller Foundation, she joined the Obama Administration in 2009 as senior deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and served as the agency's acting chairman from 2012-2014.  Early life and education  As a young child, she and her family were among the roughly 120,000 Japanese-Americans interned by the federal government during World War II. Together with her parents George and Yoshiko and her brother George Jr., she spent roughly 18 months at Tule Lake camp, just south of the Oregon border, turning 6 while in captivity. Shikegawa recalled in an interview, ‚ÄúI remember that we were very cold and that my mother used to go out and try to find scraps of wood, something to keep us warm. While we were in the camp my brother got whooping cough.‚Äù In 1958, she received a bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr College.  Career  Motivated by an interest in historical documentaries, Shigekawa moved to New York City to pursue her career. Her first job was as an assistant to CBS producer Julian Claman, who was working on cultural programming for the network. There were few female role models in the industry at the time. As Shigekawa told the Journal of Independent Film and Video Artists in 1976, ‚Äú[W]hen I started working, it never occurred to me that I could be a producer, because I would look around CBS and I didn‚Äôt see any women producers. There were women who were forty year old production assistants, and that was the kind of job I wanted to have. It didn‚Äôt occur to me that all the young men who were already production assistants were planning their careers as producers and directors‚Ä¶.‚Äù She gained skills and experience in a series of early jobs, including working on NBC's Today Show, at New York's public television network WNET, in theatrical production, and as a field director of admissions at Barnard College. In 1963, she helped two friends produce a low-budget documentary series about the circus, earning her first associate producer's credit. In 1973, while working as an independent producer, she received a call from Ronnie Eldridge, who spearheaded special projects for the newly created feminist monthly publication Ms., about an hour-long special the magazine was planning for national television. Shigekawa signed on as producer of what became Woman Alive!,a feminist documentary series made by and for women that showcased the changing role of women in society. The series, which aired on New York's public television channel WNET/13, featured individual women's stories from across the country. Presented in ‚Äúmagazine‚Äù format, each half-hour episode included documentaries by female filmmakers, performances by female artists and entertainers, and expert commentary from leading women such as Gloria Steinem and Lily Tomlin. In a review on June 16, 1974, New York Times television critic Ellen Cohn described Woman Alive!as ‚Äúpowerful, provocative, moving, and funny.‚Äù On October 22, 1975, New York Times critic John O‚ÄôConnor wrote that Woman Alive!‚Äúachieves a most impressive level of effectiveness, scattering valuable insights and modest epiphanies with attractive care and intelligence.‚Äù Women Alive! broadcast 10 episodes in 1975 and five more in 1977, but was unable to secure sufficient corporate funding to continue beyond its initial Corporation for Public Broadcasting Grant.  Philanthropic leadership  Shigekawa was the first director of the arts program at the Nathan Cummings Foundation in New York City. In 1985, she became the inaugural director of the international Production Laboratory at the Program for Art on Film, a partnership between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the J. Paul Getty Trust. From 1995-2009, she served as associate director of the Rockefeller Foundation, where she led the foundation's domestic and international programs in the arts, including the NYC Cultural Innovation Fund, Creativity in a Digital Age, and cultural exchanges between U.S. artists and their counterparts in Southeast Asia. The NYC Cultural Innovation Fund was an effort to ‚Äúenhance New York City‚Äôs role as a global center of creativity, culture, and diversity, and strengthen its economic and cultural vitality.‚Äù During her tenure, Shigekawa oversaw the awarding of 49 CIF grants totaling $7.8 million.  National Endowment for the Arts  When Rocco Landesman became chairman of the NEA, he recruited Shigekawa to serve as senior deputy chairman, a role she held from 2009-12. In October 2009, Landesman referred to his hiring of Shigekawa as ‚Äúthe best move I‚Äôve made.‚Äù In 2012, when Landesman stepped down, Shigekawa became acting NEA chairman. During her tenure, she worked closely with the Department of Defense and Kathy Roth-Douquet, CEO of the nonprofit organization Blue Star Families, to create in 2010 the Blue Star Museums program, which grants free admission to active duty military members and their families from Armed Forces Day to Labor Day. More than 2,000 museums participate across all 50 states, serving roughly 850,000 service personnel and their families each year. Shigekawa also led efforts with the Department of Defense and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to expand delivery of creative arts therapy and healing arts to wounded warriors with PTSD and mild brain injury. During her tenure, the NEA worked in partnership with the Bureau of Economic Analysis for the Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account which, for the first time, measured the contribution of arts and culture to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The agency also created the Our Town funding program to promote creative placemaking in urban and rural America‚Äîwork inspired by research Shigekawa had funded at the Rockefeller Foundation on the interplay between arts and community development.  Other involvement  Ms. Shigekawa serves on the National Advisory Board of the Center for Asian American Media and has served as a Mayoral appointee to the New York City Cultural Affairs Advisory Commission and as a trustee of the New York Council for the Humanities, the Independent Television Service (ITVS), Grantmakers in the Arts and Grantmakers in Film and Television. Commenting on the role of the artist in the community, Shigekawa has said,‚ÄúThe role of the artist in the community is the role of any other citizen in the community---to participate, to contribute, to share, and, when possible, to lead. But to all of those tasks they bring something extra: the ability to see in a different way. The ability to create music that brings people together. The ability to create movement and joy in the summer at a festival. So both their role as a citizen and then their contribution to share their creativity as best they can.‚Äù  Personal life  Shigekawa's marriage to the late documentary filmmaker Tony Silver ended in divorce. Her daughter, Dr. Mariko Silver, served as the 10th president of Bennington College (2013-19); her son-in-law Thom Loubet is a musician. She has two grandchildren.

History  The 20th Regiment can trace their history back the 6th Anti-Tank Regiment. In 1947 after the post-war reforms of the British army, the regiment was re-designated as the 20th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. At the time, its creation, the regiment consisted of the 2nd, 8th, 44th, and 82nd Anti-Tank Batteries. At its official creation the regiment was stationed in North West Europe still from the end of the war. In 1948 the regiment was moved out of mainland Europe and moved to Dundonald Camp, Troon. At that point the regiment had 12th and 107th Field Batteries and 27th and 45th Anti-Tank Batteries. In October of the same year the 12th and 107th batteries converted to field artillery. Later in November 1950 the regiment was re-designated as the 20th Field Regiment and equipped with the 25 Pounder. Three months later moving to Cherry Tree Barracks, Colchester. The next year in 1952 the regiment moved to Quarry Camp in Hong Kong. During the mid 1950s regiment later participated in the later stages of the Korean War. During the end of the war the regiment was awarded the right to fire the last artillery round in Korea. After the end of the war in 1953 the regiment moved back to Hong Kong at Shek Kong Camp. Later in 1955 the regiment moved back the United Kingdom after almost four years away moving to Cambridge Barracks in Woolwich. Although the regiment technically didn't move to the barracks and moved later that year to Kirkee Barracks in Colchester. In 1958 as a result of the 1957 Defence White Paper the regiment lost 45 and 107 batteries as they were put into Suspended Animation. As a result, 27 and 43 batteries joined the regiment. In 1958 the regiment deployed to Cyprus. Yet again, in 1961 the regiment moved again, back to Asia in Saint Barbara Barracks in Tampin. Two years later the regiment moved back to the United Kingdom at Barford Camp at Barnard Castle. In September of 1963, the regiment was converted to a medium regiment equipped with the BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun. The next year the regiment was re-designated as the 20th Medium Regiment. In 1965 the regiment moved to Saint Barbara Barracks in Fallingbostel. While in West Germany the regiment was part of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade. Later in early 1966 the regiment was re-titled to the 20th Heavy Regiment and equipped with the M107 heavy self-propelled gun. Again in 1971 the regiment moved again, to Hopton Barracks in Devizes. In November of the same year the regiment gained its old title back, as the 20th Medium Regiment, and was re-equipped with the BL 5.5-inch Medium Gun. From June - October 1972 the regiment served in Derry and again the same time the next year, and yet again the same time frame in 1974. Finally, in late 1974 the regiment was re-designated as the 20th Light Regiment and equipped with the older M3 howitzer. The following year, in 1975, the regiment moved to Borneo Lines at Shek Kong Camp. In March 1976 the regiment was placed in suspended animation along with 27 battery. The other two batteries, 12 and 43 were moved to other regiments, 32nd Regiment and 43rd Regiment respectively.

Ruins of the castle, seen in June 2020 The County of Ferrette (or Pfirt) was a feudal jurisdiction in Alsace in the Middle Ages and the early modern period. It roughly corresponds with the Sundgau and comprised the lordships of Ferrette (Pfirt), Altkirch, Thann, Belfort, Rougemont and others. These territories were not contiguous, but formed a patchwork of jurisdictions under the Holy Roman Empire.Richard Vaughan, Charles the Bold: The Last Valois Duke of Burgundy (Boydell, 1973), pp. 86‚Äì88. The County of Ferrette emerged in the twelfth century alongside the County of Montb√©liard as a division of the pagus of Elsgau, traditionally regarded as the southernmost pagus of Alsace.Donald C. Jackman, Canes palatini: Dynastic Transplantation and the Cult of St. Simeon (Editions Enlaplage, 2010), p. 38.Tom Scott, Regional Identity and Economic Change: The Upper Rhine, 1450‚Äì1600 (Clarendon, 1999), p. 29. This was a Francophone region. In the late Middle Ages, the County of Ferrette was the most westerly Habsburg possession and a part of Further Austria. It bordered the French Duchy of Burgundy and all four dukes of the House of Valois who ruled from 1363 until 1477 made efforts to acquire it.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Good: The Apogee of Burgundy (Boydell, 1970), p. 31. It was the object of a complicated series of marriage negotiations under the first duke, Philip the Bold. In 1387, Duke Leopold IV of Austria married Catherine, daughter of Philip the Bold, fulfilling an agreement first reached in 1378. For her dower she received some rents in the county and finally in 1403 the entire county, whose officers paid homage to her on 6 February 1404.Richard Vaughan, Philip the Bold: The Formation of the Burgundian State (Boydell, 1962), pp. 83‚Äì85. When Leopold died childless in 1411, he was succeeded by his brother, Frederick IV, who seized the county of Ferrette, leaving Catherine only two castles, one of which was Belfort. Catherine, however, claimed the whole county belonged to her. Her brother, Duke John the Fearless, garrisoned the castles on her behalf. These garrisons were small. To Belfort he sent only a castellan, nine squires, a cannoneer and some valets.Richard Vaughan, John the Fearless: The Growth of Burgundian Power (Boydell, 1973), p. 151. The dispute over Ferrette continued into the reign of John's son, Philip the Good. In 1420, he made an agreement with Catherine whereby he gave her an annual pension of 3,000 francs and promised to help recover the county in return for being named as her heir. Philip opened negotiations with Frederick, even threatening war in 1422‚Äì23, but made no progress. There were hostilities between Catherine's men and the Habsburgs' in those same years, but Frederick even managed to take back Belfort. Catherine died childless in 1425, but the Burgundian claim was not immediately or permanently dropped. In 1427, a conference was held at Montb√©liard whereat Amadeus VIII, Duke of Savoy, mediated the dispute. A treaty between the Archduke of Austria and the Duke of Burgundy seems to have been signed in mid-1428. Nevertheless, Ferrette, because it lay on the common border between the two houses, was as at the centre of the fighting in the brief Austro-Burgundian war of 1431. During the war, Philip's men successfully captured Belfort in a night attack. A truce was signed in October 1431 and a peace treaty in May 1432.Vaughan, Philip the Good, pp. 64‚Äì65. In 1434, Philip bought up the claim of Catherine's sister, Margaret, to the county of Ferrette.Vaughan, Philip the Good, p. 53. On 9 May 1469, by the Treaty of Saint-Omer, Archduke Sigismund of Austria mortgaged the County of Ferrette along with the Landgraviate of Upper Alsace to Duke Charles of Burgundy to secure a loan of 50,000 florins. By the terms of the loan, the principal as well as Charles's administrative expenses had to be repaid in a single lump sum, making it unlikely that the Habsburgs would ever discharge it. Charles's own power, however, was limited by the fact that many of the rights of the counts had been pawned by the Habsburgs. Ferrette itself, for example, was in pawn for 7,000 florins.

Personal life  Jacob da Silva Solis-Cohen was born in New York City to Myer David Cohen and Judith Simiah da Silva Solis who were both from prominent Sephardic families. He was an elder brother of Leon da Silva Solis-Cohen and Solomon Solis-Cohen and a grandson of Jacob da Silva Solis. Jacob da Silva Solis-Cohen's family can be traced back to their expulsion from Spain. Of note is Solomon da Silva Solis (Jacob da Silva Solis-Cohen's great-grandfather), who fled to Amsterdam from Spain in the 17th century and married Isabel da Fonseca, daughter of the marquis of Turin, count of Villa Real and Monterrey. In 1875 he married Miriam Binswanger, with whom he had eight daughters (Judith Simira, Sophia Rebecca, Miriam Fonseca, Elinor, Rosalie Isabel, Bertha Florence, Esther and Edith) and three sons (Myer, Jacob da Silva, Jr. and Isadore).  Career  In 1840, after only two years of his life spent in New York City, his family moved to Philadelphia. Solis-Cohen was educated at Central High School and the University of Pennsylvania and Jefferson Medical College where he earned his medical degree in 1860. In 1861 he began his medical residency at Old Blockley in Philadelphia but resigned the same year to enlist as a private in the Union army at the outbreak of the Civil War. He was soon commissioned as a lieutenant in the infantry and later appointed as assistant surgeon in the Twenty-sixth Regiment of the Pennsylvania Volunteers. After serving in Hooker's Brigade in the defense of Washington, D.C., he later transferred to the Navy as Acting Assistant Surgeon, serving under Rear Admiral S.F. DuPont, in the expedition to Port Royal Harbor, South Carolina, on the United States Steamer Florida. He remained in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron until January 12, 1864, when he resigned from the Navy. After the Civil War, he began his work in the field of laryngology. In 1866, he was the first in the United States to institute regular lectures on laryngology at the Philadelphia School of Anatomy. In 1870 he was appointed lecturer on laryngoscopy and diseases of the throat and chest in the Jefferson Medical College and two years later professor of laryngology. His first work on the subject, entitled ‚ÄúInhalation in the Treatment of Disease‚Äù, was published in 1867, and was followed in 1872 by his great work ‚ÄúDiseases of the Throat and Nasal Passages.\\" In 1874, Solis-Cohen published a monograph on ‚ÄúCroup in its Relations to Tracheotomy‚Äù, based on the study of 5,000 recorded cases; in 1875 he published a book on ‚ÄúThe Throat and Voice‚Äù. He was one of the founders of the Archives of Laryngology and for many years edited the laryngological department of the American Journal of the Medical Sciences. He also helped to found the American Laryngological Association, of which he was the second president from 1880 to 1882. As the result of his experience in the Civil War he excelled in the surgery of the upper air passages. In 1892 he was the first in America to perform a successful complete laryngectomy.

Originally an Augustinian friar and missionary, he converted to Shia Islam during the early reign of Shah (King) Sultan Husayn (1694‚Äì1722) and took the name Aliqoli Jadid-ol-Eslam. He subsequently became an apologist of Shi'ism as well as a major polemicist against Christianity, Sufism, Judaism, Sunnism, philosophers and antinomians. In addition, after conversion, he served as an official interpreter (also known as a dragoman) at the royal court in Isfahan. Aliqoli Jadid-ol-Eslam was one of the late 17th century converts in Iran who \\"helped reaffirm the Majlesi brand of conservatism\\". Biography Not many details are known about Aliqoli's life. He was born sometime during the second half of the 17th century in Portugal, and was originally an Augustinian friar and missionary named Ant√≥nio de Jesus. He arrived in Isfahan, the Safavid royal capital, in 1691 at the latest. There he initially served in the retinue of Gaspar dos Reis, then head of the city's Augustinian monastery, before succeeding him in the post. He reportedly played an important role in the contacts between Portuguese diplomats and the Shah's government \\"at a time of an attempted Portuguese-Iranian alliance against the sultans of Oman in the Persian Gulf\\". Portrait of Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi He converted to Shia Islam in Isfahan during the early reign of Shah (King) Sultan Husayn (1694‚Äì1722) and took the name Aliqoli Jadid-ol-Eslam. There is no consensus on the date of his conversion. Reza Pourjavady and Sabine Schmidtke (2009) state that he converted in 1696, while according to Joao Teles e Cunha (2009), Abbas Amanat (2017) and Giorgio Rota (2017) he converted in 1697. According to Alberto Tiburcio (2018), \\"it certainly took place between 1694 and 1697\\". The precise reason for his conversion remains unknown. However, it is known that he corresponded with the long-time Capuchin resident of Isfahan, Raphael du Mans, about his intentions, and that he \\"felt disappointed by the way many missionaries bribed Muslims into conversion\\". Aliqoli Jadid-ol-Eslam's life bears similarities to that of his fellow former Augustinian missionary, Manuel de Santa Maria, who also lived in Iran and who took the name Hasan-Qoli Beg after embracing Islam. After apostatising, Aliqoli became an apologist for Shia Islam as well as a major polemicist against Christianity, Sufism and Judaism. Abbas Amanat adds that in one of his major works, the , Aliqoli not only made \\"a violent attack on Christians, Jews, and Sunnis but also on philosophers, Sufis, and antinomians\\". In addition, after conversion, he served as a dragoman, a translator and interpreter of European languages, at the Shah's court in Isfahan, succeeding du Mans to the post. Aliqoli was one of the late 17th century converts in Iran who \\"helped reaffirm the Majlesi brand of conservatism\\"; his appointment as royal dragoman further confirmed the Safavid state's \\"patronage of a prevailing xenophobic tendency\\". Tiburcio notes that according to one source, Aliqoli may have played a role in the persecution of the Catholic Armenian Shahremanian (Sceriman) family. He displayed detailed knowledge of Shi'ite intellectual history in at least one of his works, which also referenced Church historians. However, not all of his writings are extant, and of those works that survive, not all are fully preserved. Aliqoli is known to have married. According to an August 1710 letter written by Louis-Marie Pidou de Saint-Olon, the Bishop of Babylon, his health had declined by that time, and he was reportedly suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Aliqoli died , probably in Isfahan, though the precise location remains uncertain. Works Aliqoli wrote several works (treatises) in the field of interreligious polemics. These include: * Hedayat ol-dallin (or ol-modallin) va-taqviyat ol-mo'menin (\\"Guidance for those who are led (or who lead) astray and strengthening for the believers\\"), consisting of four volumes. It was Aliqoli's first major work and was probably written around 1708 in either Portuguese or Latin. It was immediately translated into Persian. He dedicated the work to Shah Sultan Husayn. The Persian version exists in several manuscripts, but none of these is complete. * Sayf ol- mo'menin fi qetal ol-moshrekin (\\"The sword of the faithful in the fight against the associators\\"). This was Aliqoli's second major work; written in Persian, it was completed on 2 June 1711. * Fava'ed-e ezdevaj (\\"The benefits of marriage\\"). One of his minor works, it was probably completed before 1711 and was written in Persian. * Resaleh dar radd-e jama'at-e sufiyan (\\"Treatise in refutation of the community of Sufis\\"). One of his minor works. Probably completed before 1711, it was written in Persian.

Anciently it was known as Corycus or Korykos (), or as Cimarus or Kimaros (ŒöŒØŒºŒ±œÅŒøœÇ); although the latter is ascribed to the cape at the northern extremity of the peninsula (Cape Vouxa). Strabo states that Corycus was the point whence the distances to the several ports of Peloponnesus were measured. We learn from Pliny that the islands which lie off this promontory were called Corycae (modern Gramvousa), and that part of the mass of rock which forms this point went by the name of Mount Corycus.

Early life  Dixon was born at Tibooburra, New South Wales, probably in 1917, to Albert Ebsworth, a stockman of the Galali language group, and his wife Rosie, n√©e Jones. She and her siblings attended the Tibooburra public school, and spent much of their free time with their Wangkumara-speaking maternal grandparents in the bush around the town, learning about bush tucker, significant sites and traditional stories. Dixon's parents also took them to ceremonial gatherings, including a major initiation held at Innamincka in the early 1920s, and regularly took them travelling through their traditional country, following the tracks of ancestral beings during the Dreaming.  Forced move to Brewarrina  In 1938, the Aboriginal Protection Board moved Aboriginal people living at Tibooburra to a ration station near Brewarrina, over two hundred miles away, forcing them to comply by threatening them with guns and with having their children removed. Dixon and her extended family had to leave their homes with just a few hours' notice, taking only a few belongings, and were loaded into trucks for the trip. At Brewarrina, accommodation which had been barely adequate for the one hundred people previously living there now had to cater for over five hundred people. The women were told to sleep on the schoolhouse floor, and the men on the verandah. The manager was armed and intimidating, and the Wangkumara people felt isolated among the other cultural groups living there. Within a short time, Dixon's grandmother and step-great-grandfather died. Dixon's sister had been pregnant when they were all removed from Tibooburra, and died soon after giving birth in Brewarrina Hospital. The manager did not permit any of Dixon's family to leave the station for work or outings in Brewarrina, and forbade them to use their traditional language.  Move to Bourke  After about three or four years, a new station manager arrived, who allowed Dixon and her family to leave. They moved to Bourke, where Lorna met and married Eric Dixon, a stationhand, from Walgett. They had twelve or seventeen children together. Lorna Dixon's parents died not long after moving to Bourke. After the years of being prohibited from speaking her language, Dixon did not teach it to her children. However, when alone, and especially before going to sleep at night, she had translated her thoughts into Wangkumara. She also devised a way of spelling the language, which she shared with a cousin living at Broken Hill, and they used it to write letters to each other, as they felt they could express their feelings better in Wangkumara than in English.  Language and cultural documentation  In 1970, Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies researcher Janet Mathews, who was recording Aboriginal music, languages and stories of the past in country areas of New South Wales, heard of Lorna Dixon. Dixon was keen to document her knowledge of the Wangkumara language and traditional customs, stories and significant sites. She recorded more than sixty tapes of one and a half hours each with Mathews. She also identified many sacred and significant sites in the \\"Corner Country\\" around Tibooburra, Naryilco and Cooper's Creek, with Mathews and with a NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service Aboriginal Sites Survey Officer, Howard Creamer. In 1974, Dixon was elected a member of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. In 2004, a room at the institute was named the Laura Mandima Dixon Room in her honour. In 1994, nine of Dixon's traditional stories were published in an anthology titled The Opal that Turned into Fire and Other Stories from the Wangkumara (Magabala Books, ).  Death  Dixon died at Bourke on 21 December 1976, of a cerebral haemorrhage.

J√∂rg Heikhaus is also the founder of the gallery 'heliumcowboy' (since 2002) in Hamburg, whose operation was temporarily suspended in 2013 to devote himself better to his own work as an artist. Until 2012, the project was promoted without a direct link to the artist himself, which made it unknown who was behind the pseudonym. The purpose of this secrecy was to perform various self- presentations and explore the extent to which an artist without an explicit identity can establish itself. At the beginning of 2010, the artist dropped his anonymity and uses Alex Diamond as a pseudonym. Following the end of the project with an exhibition at in 2012, Heikhaus continued to use the Alex Diamond artist name.  Work  Alex Diamond's work focuses mainly on working with wood. Characteristic of his works are dynamic figures and a strict and reduced coloring. Both are often found in the woodcuts, wall sculptures, installations, as well as the furniture and wood prints of the artist. Typical for his stage sets are layered, meticulously crafted and detailed sculptural woodcuts mixed with various painting and dyeing techniques. At the center of his artistic activity is the woodcut, which he does not understand as a mere printing instrument, but already as a work in itself. The artist sees himself mainly as a 'story teller'. The main part of his work is devoted to the analysis and interpretation of contemporary culture and its recurrent patterns of recognition, with an artistic focus on the study of the social and cultural aspects of human coexistence.

Cables plays solo on six of the ten cuts here ... These performances are simply stellar, and in places breathtaking. Cables is one of the great rhythmic pianists out there who seamlessly weaves the long jazz piano tradition of players like Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson into the work of more percussive and strident improvisers like Jaki Byard and even Randy Weston\\" but noted \\"the music is more than sufficient throughout, but the sequencing feels like this was pieced together from a number of performances. The sound quality in places is dodgy -- particularly on the drums, which sound all hissy, with a load of mic sheen. An ensemble tune precedes three solo numbers, then come two more group performances, followed by two more solos and ending with an ensemble tune. Joe Fields of all people should know better. The flow of this CD is uneven, jaunty, and lacks continuity. While the performances are flawless throughout and the set swings like mad, the strangeness of the dynamics make it difficult to listen to all the way through\\". On All About Jazz, Terrell Kent Holmes called it \\" a tale of two gigs. While the quartet performances are middling, Cables' overall dynamism, particularly on his solo piano turns, lifts the disc above mediocrity\\" and stated \\"Ultimately it's Cables' piano that saves Morning Song. He mines jazz's heavier elements, fusing Bud Powell's feeling, Fats Waller's juke joint geniality and Art Tatum's quick wit into his own transformative lyricism\\".Holmes, T. K. All About Jazz Review accessed February 26, 2019 On the same site Jay Deshpande said \\"Although the commercial sound of late 70s jazz can feel dated and contrived, it is a valuable reminder of the way things were ... In 1980, Cables was at the height of his popularity. Morning Song showcases the pianist's gifts, but the track order is often ungainly ... Generally, the solo numbers on this record have much more creative potential than the quartet efforts\\".Deshpande, J.

The game takes place within an alternate history version of 19th century America that incorporates steampunk elements, in which players take control of a private detective who tackles a series of cases while trying to uncover the identity of a criminal who caused their partner's death. Although operating like a standard point- and-click adventure game, players have no inventory and can decide how to acquire information and how a case is solved, with the game's overall ending affected by the choices made.  Gameplay  Players conduct the game as a former cop turned private detective in their efforts to solve a series of cases. Each of the game's locations, those relevant to a case and uncovered during an investigation, feature various objects that can be examined - some are trivial, while others may hide important clues to the current case - alongside a variety of individuals who can be questioned on different subjects. Any relevant information, such as clues and documents, are recorded in a casebook belonging to the detective; any objects that can be used to help solve puzzles, are also stored in the casebook, rather than the traditional inventory system used by games of the same genre, and used automatically where needed. Alongside clues and documents, the casebook also lists any possible suspects based on clues and conversations with relevant people, and a list of objectives which define what the player should be doing in their investigation. With the exception of the first case, the game's prologue, each case features a choice in how to proceed in various circumstances - for example, if a player tries to get a character to be more co-operative through using something against them, they are given a choice of how to do so. While the correct choice will allow them to gleam new information, the wrong choice will close off an avenue of investigation to them, and effectively a solution to how a crime was committed. Although a game does not end if the player chooses incorrectly, what choices are made can not only determine how an investigation concludes - including who, if any, is arrested for a crime - but also impact the game's overall ending; repeated mistakes with choices and declaring cases unsolvable, ultimately lead to the game's negative ending.  Plot  Setting Lamplight City takes place within an alternate 19th century Earth that incorporates steampunk elements. In this timeline, the North American colonies remained a part of the British Empire and developed into a nation called Vespuccia, which retains many elements of British culture at the time, including currency and political systems, with the Industrial Revolution being more advanced and developing \\"steam-tech\\" that included automated machines and airships. The game's story takes place with the city of New Bretagne - a city that combines the Victorian elements of New Orleans, New York and London - divided into several districts, which is facing growing disruptions against the growing use of steam-tech. Story In 1844, detectives Miles Fordham and Bill Leger visit New Bretagne's roughest district to investigate a report about a series of break-ins at a flower shop. The men learn that a thief regularly breaks in to steal an order of flowers from the shop, but mysteriously leaves money behind in the process. Miles' decision to stake out the shop and catch the thief in the act goes disastrously wrong when they are spooked, and the subsequent pursuit to the rooftop causes the untimely death of Bill. Guilt-ridden over his partner's death, Miles retires from the city's police and pursues a new career as a private investigator. However, following the funeral he begins to hear the voice of his deceased partner, who urges him to locate the burglar who caused his death, forcing him to take a sleeping medicine to cope with the strain it places on both his mental well-being and personal life with his wife Adelaide. To help him deal with the death of his partner, Constance Upton, a female assistant in the city's police and close friend, provides leads to cases for him to investigate. A few months into his new career, Miles is give a series of cases by Upton to solve - the attempted murder of a wealthy woman; the kidnapping of an infant child; the suspicious death of a woman found burnt to ashes; and the murder of a man during Vespuccia's election night. As he attempts to investigate the cases, Miles begins to change how he copes, opting to stop taking his medicine and go drinking at the pub he and Bill visit. However, his decision causes him to become estranged with his wife, who forces him out of their home after being unable to cope with his change in behavior, and leaving him no choice but to stay with Upton as a result. Shortly after successfully completing all or most of his cases, Miles is informed by Upton that a member of the Vespuccian parliament was recently murdered by a serial killer known as \\"The Justice Killer\\". Upton explains that until this latest murder, the only connection with the other victims was that they all came from the same district. Providing him with crime scene sketches she had copied, Upton asks Miles to investigate the case due to the increasing panic amongst the city's inhabitants. Reviewing the sketches, Miles discovers that all the victims received an Easter lily: the same kind of flower that had been stolen by the burglar he and Bill tried to arrest. When his former boss, Police Chief Snelling, arrives to question Upton on her recent actions of leaking police investigations, Miles convinces him to let him investigate the murders, and is given until the following day to solve it or be arrested for meddling in police affairs. Investigating each of the previous victims soon leads Miles to learn that each of the murdered men either beat up or killed a woman, most of whom were prostitutes, and that the killer sought justice for these. When he visits the brothel linked to the murders, Miles learns that Samuel Collins, the nephew of one of the prostitutes, was both the killer and the thief. He discovers evidence showing that he sought justice against men that had attacked women, in response to his aunt's death at the hand of a client, leaving Easter lilies behind to honor her memory. Miles eventually confronts Samuel at his home and denounces him as the killer, disagreeing with his belief of justice. Before Samuel can strangle Fordham to prevent exposure, Snelling arrives and kills him, commending Miles on solving the case. A few weeks later, Miles visits Bill's grave, admitting that he misses his voice since it had stopped upon catching his killer, but believes both have now gotten what they wanted and can now move on. Alternate Endings While the above is the canon storyline of the game, depending on how the player chooses to handle a situation, certain key moments directly impact how the game might end instead: * If the player has someone else arrested in each case and not the culprit of the investigation that is canon to the story, Samuel Collins is identified as the killer by Miles, who decides to pass on his information to the police the following day. Samuel promptly pursues after him through his contacts in the brothel, finding him at Upton's apartment. Although he attacks the wrong person before confronting Miles, Upton recovers and kills him before he can kill Miles. The rest of the ending plays out as the true ending of the story. * If the player exposes Upton for her theft of the sketches or arrests the wrong person sought after to provide a lead during the final case, Miles is thrown in prison on a charge of obstructing justice, leaving him to trapped in a cell and having to endure Bill's voice tormenting him on his fate. * If the player denounces most of the four cases as unsolvable, Miles decides to admit himself into the city's asylum, asking Upton to promise that she will conceal his action from his wife. Bill struggles to torment Miles for committing himself to a mental institution, as his friend prepares to undergo treatment to cure himself.  Development and release  Lamplight City uses the Adventure Game Studio engine. The inventory system was inspired by the 1997 video game Blade Runner. Other influences include Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, Dishonored, and Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers. The fictional city in which the game is set, New Bretagne, is a mix of New York City, New Orleans, and Victorian London. Video game developer Francisco Gonzalez had previously worked for Wadjet Eye Games, who was to publish the game. After the release of Shardlight in 2016, Gonzalez was laid off as a full time designer. Ultimately, he and Wadjet Eye decided not to go forward with publishing Lamplight City, citing creative differences. As a result, Gonzalez sought a new publisher. Applications Systems Heidelberg released it on September 13, 2018.  Reception  On Metacritic, a review aggregator, the PC version has a score of 72/100 based on 16 reviews, which the site categorizes as \\"mixed or average reviews\\". GameSpot rated it 6/10 stars; reviewer James O'Connor wrote that the game is \\"full of great ideas, but isn't quite able to pull them off effectively\\". Although praising the character and dialogue, O'Connor said the ability to fail a case turns out to be a gimmick, as the cases are not challenging. Richard Hoover of Adventure Gamers rated it 3/5 stars, praising the visuals, sound, music, and worldbuilding. However, Hoover wrote that the game is not sufficiently interactive. Instead of offering branching storylines, player choices seem not to affect the story much except for possibly locking out certain content. Reviewing the game for Hardcore Gaming101, Jonathan Kaharl wrote that although the game initially seems to be lacking, its polish and excellent design makes it \\"one of the tightest, most constantly great games\\" of its genre. Although she said the game is a bit too easy, Tina Olah of RPGFan rated it 82/100 and called it \\"just plain fun\\", highlighting the plot as \\"genuinely interesting and surprising\\". The game was nominated for \\"Best Original Choral Composition\\" with \\"Down Among the Dead Men\\" at the 2019 G.A.N.G. Awards.

As an attorney, he was employed in public capacities in Northeastern Ohio as a Legal Aid Public Defender, United States Attorney, and City of Cleveland attorney. In response to the Cuyahoga River fire, as U.S. Attorney in 1970 he led the first Federal grand jury water pollution investigations and prosecutions setting into motion the recovery of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie and the development of the Clean Water Act. Education Jones enrolled in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at Ohio University and spent two years after college graduation as an officer in U.S. Army Active Duty; his reserve unit was disbanded in 1968 after he had attained the rank of major. Jones graduated from Western Reserve School of Law in 1957; he was named ‚ÄúStudent of the Year‚Äù by the Student Bar Association. He married Ann Hull, of the Hull pottery family and developed a private trial law practice. United States Attorney In Cleveland, pollution was a demoralizing embarrassment to the citizenry. As described in ‚ÄúFables of the Cuyahoga: Reconstructing a History of Environmental Protection:‚Äù \\"On June 22, 1969, just before noon, an oil slick and assorted debris under a railroad trestle on the Cuyahoga River caught fire...The fire attracted national media attention, including stories in Time, and National Geographic...The image of a river ablaze was seared into the nation‚Äôs emerging environmental consciousness\\". As the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moved ahead on pollution control, the Attorney General of the United States, John N. Mitchell gave a press conference December 18, 1970: ‚ÄúAs in the case of other government departments and agencies, EPA refers civil and criminal suits to the Department of Justice, which determines whether there is a base for prosecution and of course, if we find it so, we proceed with court action‚Ä¶And today, I would like to announce that we are filing suit this morning against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company. Jones was the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio during December 1970. It was the time of the first legal steps taken by the EPA and the Department of Justice to prosecute water polluters and protect the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. The Plain Dealer documented the efforts of Jones in multiple stories that December: ‚ÄúU.S. Opens Probe Here on Pollution:‚Äù A federal grand jury today is to begin an investigation of water pollution allegedly being caused by about 12 companies in northeastern Ohio. A U.S. Department of Justice source said yesterday it would be the first grand jury investigation of water pollution in this area. Expected to handle presentation of the cases are Acting U.S. Attorney Robert W. Jones and Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward S. Molnar. ‚ÄúCharges J&L; With Pollution:‚Äù U.S. authorities have filed criminal charges against Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp for allegedly discharging 75 tons of blast furnace waste a day in the Cuyahoga River over a 10-day period. U.S. Attorney Robert W. Jones filed the misdemeanor charges in District Court Wednesday, alleging violations of the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act. ‚ÄúU.S. Jury Indicts CEI on Ash Dumping in Lake‚Äù read the front-page headline. A federal grand jury here indicted four corporations yesterday for polluting Lake Erie and waterways in northeast Ohio. Facing fines are Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Shell Oil Company, Uniroyal Chemical Division of Uniroyal Inc. and Olin Corp. The companies were charged under the 1899 Rivers and Harbors Act, which makes dumping refuse in navigable waters illegal. CEI faces 20 counts in the indictment. The company is accused of dumping 33 tons of fly ash, a coal residue, in Lake Erie. The cases, developed in part by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, were presented to the jury by acting U.S. Atty. Robert W. Jones and Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward S. Molnar. ‚ÄúPollution Suits Hit U.S. Steel:‚Äù The nation's largest steel producer yesterday was added to the list of companies charged by the federal government with polluting waterways in northeastern Ohio. In twin suits filed in U.S. District Court here, the U.S. Steel Corp. was accused of dumping cyanides in the Cuyahoga and Black rivers. Assistant U.S. Atty. Edward S. Molnar and acting U.S. Atty. Robert W. Jones are spearheading the government's latest water pollution prosecutions here. Subsequently, Jones filed suit October 13, 1971 asking that Metals Applied Inc. be enjoined from dumping ‚Äúhexavalent chromium, suspended solids and oil‚Äù into the Cuyahoga River. It was largely based on these and other litigation experiences that criteria for new legislation were identified leading to the Clean Water Act. The Act creation was inspired by the burning Cuyahoga River fire news reports that had sparked an environmental revolution. City of Cleveland Attorney In 1972, three years after the Cuyahoga River caught fire and amid pressures from the EPA, Mayor Ralph Perk formed the NEORSD-or the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District with the assistance of Jones. Perk had to rethink regional Cleveland-Cuyahoga County governmental structure and agencies. After leaving the U.S. Attorney's office in 1972, Jones was brought in to the Cleveland Legal Department. Perk left office in 1977. The Ohio EPA, The NEORSD, The City of Cleveland and many others have celebrated the 50th anniversary of the recovery of the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie since the fire of 1969, including events and news articles. Legal aid public defender and law professor While with the law firm Zellmer, Rhein and Gruber in 1965, Jones filed a precedent-setting motion involving a business owner‚Äôs liberty rights and the search of a business by authorities. Later in 1965, Jones began trial practice with the Public Defender‚Äôs Office of the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. Jones began defending a woman arrested by Cleveland Police as a suspicious person. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968 had raised consciousness. This case involving civil and political rights eventually was heard by The Ohio Supreme Court; it was summarized in a Plain Dealer News Article in 1969: ‚ÄúSuspicious Persons Law Killed by Court.‚Äù In 1967 the Plain Dealer reported how Jones became his defendant's hero, ‚ÄúUnwanted Lawyer Is Hero Now:‚Äù Jack Klein was acquitted of theft charges through the efforts of a court appointed lawyer [Jones] he tried to fire. Another jury returned an equally speedy verdict; The Plain Dealer reported it as ‚ÄúEyes Win Innocent Verdict.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never forget those deep blue eyes,‚Äù [she] told the courtroom of Common Pleas Judge Herbert R. Whiting. He was identified by her from a black and white police photo. ‚ÄúStare into those deep blue eyes,‚Äù Jones told each of the jurors. After the trial ended, the jury went to the deliberation room and spent one hour discussing the case. They returned with an innocent verdict. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù asked Jones. ‚ÄúThose ‚Äòdeep blue eyes‚Äô were a very light hazel.‚Äù Jones was promoted to chief trial attorney after 4 years with the Public Defender‚Äôs Office. Jones conducted a trial practice program for Case Western Reserve University School of Law senior law students 1965-69. In Spring 1968 Jones ran unsuccessfully against Blanche Krupansky in the Republican primary for Common Pleas Judge. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Jones became Assistant U.S. Attorney in 1969 and given control of the trial docket. In March 1970 he was promoted to First Assistant by U.S. Attorney Robert B. Krupansky. The Kent State shootings were investigated. Jones, as a member of the Drug Abuse Committee of the Cleveland Area Coordinating Counsel, participated in the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Program which led to the creation of an Addiction medicine center at University Circle, Cleveland. Jones also assisted in ending the U.S. postal strike of 1970. National attention was received by the investigations into the conspiracy to slay labor leader Joseph Yablonski. A nationwide F.B.I. investigation produced sufficient evidence to charge three Cleveland area residents with conspiracy to slay Yablonski. Through Grand Jury proceedings, a series of three conspiracy indictments were returned charging five individuals. The investigation was conducted by Krupansky, assisted by Jones. Former United Mine Worker's president W. A. Boyle was eventually indicted by a Grand Jury on a charge of conspiring to murder Joseph A. Yablonski, his rival for the union leadership in 1969. Yablonski's wife and daughter were also slain. Boyle was convicted. The U.S. Attorney exploits of Jones were the subject of numerous news stories. A Wall Street Journal reporter retold stories of bank robbery goofs; other reports included stories of consumer goods thefts from trucks, bond theft by a bank employee, bank embezzlement, tax evasion by a company president, counterfeit money conspiracy, armed bank robbery and manslaughter at sea. Jones ran as the losing Republican candidate for Cuyahoga County Prosecutor against the long-term incumbent John T. Corrigan in November 1972. In December 1976 The Bar Association of Greater Cleveland sent Republican Governor Rhodes its recommendations for four vacancies in the Probate, Common Pleas and Municipal Courts. But Jones was not appointed. He entered into a private consulting practice. Images of original documents and out of print news articles related to Jones are archived on the website Robert Walter Jones J. D. Library and Archive.

Background  The Kashmir insurgency has been occurring since 1989, but a new wave of violence was witnessed during 2016 when Burhan Wani then commander of Hizbul Mujahideen was killed in an encounter. In 2018, more than 500 people (including civilians, soldiers and militants) were killed in the violence.Kashmir: Why India and Pakistan fight over it , BBC News On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle- borne suicide bomber at Lethpora in the Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The attack resulted in the deaths of 46 Central Reserve Police Force personnel and the attacker. The perpetrator of the attack was from Indian- administered Kashmir. India Blames Pakistan for Attack in Kashmir, Promising a Response , New York Times. 15 February 2019. Quote:The militant who claimed responsibility for the attack, Aadil Ahmad Dar, was from a village about six miles from where the Indian convoy was struck, in contrast to the fighters and weapons that once streamed in from Pakistani-occupied areas to sustain the insurgency. And the explosives he packed into his car appear to have been locally procured, security experts said. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. Pulwama Attack 2019, everything about J&K; terror attack on CRPF by terrorist Adil Ahmed Dar, Jaish-eMohammad , India Today, 16 February 2019. Pakistan condemned the attack, and denied any connection to it. The airstrike occurred ahead of the 2019 Indian general election.Tensions Between India and Pakistan Are at Their Highest Point in Decades. Here's What to Know , TIME. On 19 February, Pakistan's PM attributed Indian government's desire to attack Pakistan to the upcoming election. The Indian government rejected the allegation. Incident On 26 February 2019, Pakistan announced the intrusion of Indian aircraft into its airspace, but asserted that the Indian fleet was intercepted, causing them to retreat, to release their bombs which hit an open area, and to dump their fuel. In a press briefing, Pakistan's Director-General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major General Asif Ghafoor, stated that three IAF teams were spotted approaching the Pakistan border from various sectors in the early hours of 26 February. He added that the two of these teams did not cross the border following a challenge from Pakistani aircraft flying combat air patrol, but the third one crossed the Line of Control from the Kiran Valley near Muzaffarabad before being intercepted by Pakistani Air Force (PAF) jets within three minutes of the incursion. Pervez Khattak, Pakistani Defence Minister, stated that the Pakistani Air Force did not retaliate at that time because \\"they could not gauge the extent of the damage\\". Later on 26 February 2019, India confirmed the airstrike, stating that the Indian Air Force conducted them in retaliation to the Pulwama attack. The strikes were subsequently claimed to be \\"non-military\\" and \\"preemptive in nature; targeting a Jaish-e-Mohammed facility within Pakistan. The airstrike was the first time since the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 that attacking warplanes had crossed the Line of Control. Indian media claimed to have confirmed from official sources that twelve Mirage 2000 jets were involved in the operation. The Indian Express further reported that the Mirage 2000s were carrying SPICE 2000 & Popeye precision-guided munitions and that they were supported by four Sukhoi Su-30MKI, Netra and Phalcon airborne early warning and control aircraft, an IAI Heron UAV and two Ilyushin Il-78 aerial refuelling aircraft. Furthermore Indian officials claim that four SU-30MKIs were launched from their South Punjab base and headed towards Jodhpur and on to Barmer, Rajasthan before turning West towards Jaish-e-Mohammed headquarters in Pakistan located in the populous town of Bahawalpur. These four aircraft, tasked as decoys, successfully drew PAF fighters way south of the main attack force.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iaf-fooled-pakistan-with- decoy-fighters/articleshow/68238409.cms After releasing the bombs, the jets returned into Indian airspace unharmed and the Indian media claimed that whilst Pakistan scrambled its F-16 jets, they could not engage the Indian planes.  The target  There has been ambiguity among the sources as to what the exact target was, and about whether the madrassa ‚Äì Taleem ul-Quran run by Masood Azhar's brother-in-law, Muhammad Yusuf Azhar, was an active JeM camp or not. According to WikiLeaks, a 2004 United States Department of Defence interrogation report stated that Balakot had \\"a training camp that offers both basic and advanced terrorist training on explosives and artillery.\\" In contrast, military analysts asserted that whilst the area used to host militant camps, they dispersed after the 2005 Pakistan earthquake to avoid detection by the international aid groups providing relief in the area. Indian intelligence sources claim that the camp was located in a hilltop forest, from Balakot, and that it was a resort-style facility, with space and room for 500‚Äì700 militants, including a swimming pool, cooks and cleaners. The New York Times mentioned western security officials of having doubted the existence of such large-scale training camps, asserting that Pakistan no longer runs them and that \\"militant groups are spread out in small groups around the country\\". The local people varied as to the purpose of the facility. In the immediate aftermath of the strikes, whilst some claimed of it being an active Jaish training camp, others asserted it to have been a mere school for the local children and that such militant camps used to exist far earlier.As it happened: Tension mounts after Indian fighter jets cross Kashmir frontier, bomb camps , Gulf News On later visits by Reuters, the locals claimed that the school had been shut down about a year back and was no longer operational.  Damage  Neutral sources have asserted that the munitions dropped by Indian warplanes appeared to have hit several trees in a wooded area but caused no other damage, nor any casualties in the area where the attack took place. Some Western diplomats also stated that they did not believe Indian Air Force had hit any militant camp. Western security officials have cast doubt over Indian claims and asserted that there are no longer any such large scale militant camps in Pakistan. India has asserted that \\"a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis,\\" who were preparing for launching another suicide attack targeting Indian assets, were killed. Indian media reported that the camp was leveled, and about 200‚Äì350 JeM militants were killed though the exact figures varied across media-houses. The National Technical Research Organisation had located about 300 active mobile phones in the camp; prior to the strike. In contrast, Pakistan asserted that there were no casualties or infrastructure damage as a result of the attack. Villagers from the area spoke of four bombs striking a nearby forest and field around 3 AM, damaging a building, and injuring a local man. Journalists associated with the Associated Press visited the area on 26 February and saw craters and damaged trees. The villagers they met reported no casualties.Tensions escalate as Indian airstrike hits inside Pakistan , Associated Press A team from Al Jazeera visited the site two days after the strikes and noted \\"splintered pine trees and rocks\\" which were strewn across the four blast craters. The local hospital officials and residents asserted that they did not come across any casualty or wounded people. The reporters located the facility, a school run by Jaish-e-Mohammed, at around a kilometre to the east of one of the bomb craters, atop a steep ridge but were unable to access it. Reporters from Reuters were repeatedly denied access to the madrassa by the military citing security issues but they noted the structure (and its vicinity) to be intact from the back. The press wing of the Pakistan military had twice postponed scheduled visits to the site. However, on 29 March 2019, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) took journalist to the site where the strike took place. There were around 375 students present in the Madrasa. Journalist were allowed to interview the students. They were also allowed to take photos and record video of the site.  Satellite data assessments  Satellite-data analysis by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's Nathan Ruser concluded that there is \\"no apparent evidence of more extensive damage and on the face of it does not validate Indian claims regarding the effect of the strikes.\\" Michael Sheldon, a digital forensics analyst from Atlantic Council did another independent investigation on the issue which asserted that no damage was inflicted to any infrastructure around the target-site. It concluded that \\"something appeared to have gone wrong in the targeting process\\" and that the botch-up was mysterious in light of the autonomous nature of the supposedly used missiles. A Reuters investigation based on high-resolution satellite imagery by Planet Labs noted an unchanged landscape when compared to an April 2018 satellite photo. It noted that \\"there were no discernible holes in the roofs of buildings, no signs of scorching, blown-out walls, displaced trees around the madrasa or other signs of an aerial attack\\". Even higher quality imagery, taken from the WorldView-2 satellite, was later also analysed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and showed \\"that all three weapons missed by similar (but not identical) distances\\" suggesting \\"that the misses were caused by a systematic targeting error\\". European Space Imaging also provided high-resolution image of the site where the strike took place. The satellite imagery was from 27 February 2019, a day after the strike took place. The image showed that buildings were unharmed and there was no sign of casualties at the site. Managing director Adrian Zevenbergen, claimed that \\"there were no signs of scorching, no large distinguishable holes in the buildings and no signs of stress to the surrounding vegetation\\". Indian officials claims In contrast, Indian officials said that analysis of before and after images from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) carried by an airborne platform showed that four buildings had been destroyed but did not release those images. The official stated that SAR images from the first day after the attack showed that the roofs of the building (made of corrugated galvanized iron (CGI) sheets) were missing, and were repaired after two days. According to the official the presence of new roofs had made the assessment by technical intelligence difficult and it was up to the Indian Government to decide on the release of the classified SAR images. The Indian Air Force showed the reporters of India Today and other media houses, the high-resolution satellite pictures possessed by the IAF which according to India Today showed three holes in the roof of one of the buildings. These holes were reported as a \\"classic signature of a SPICE bomb strike\\". Media reports Reuters journalists were prevented from coming near the site of the attack, three times in nine days by the Pakistani security officials. Business Today India stated that the area around Balakot had been cordoned off by the Pakistan Army and evidence such as the dead bodies were being cleared from the area. Praveen Swami writing for Firstpost claimed that Indian intelligence estimated a figure of about 20 casualties and that there were five confirmed kills per burial records. He also noted a JeM rally in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on 28 February, wherein Masood Azhar's brother, Abdul Rauf Rasheed Alvi mentioned India's attack of their headquarters and vowed revenge. In another piece he state that RAW analysts estimated 90 casualties including three Pakistani Army trainers, based on intercepted communications in the immediate. Swami though noted a lack of witness testimony to independently assess the validity of above claims. USA State Department acknowledged reports of Pakistan misusing the F-16s, although undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Affairs didn't mention concerns about the use of F-16s in shooting down Indian fighter jets since acknowledging it in formal State Department transmission would be a clear violation of Congress approved terms for selling the fighters as it would trigger formal procedures to reprimand Islamabad when Trump administration wants to repair bilateral diplomatic relations. Aftermath The IAF put air defence systems on alert along the international border and Line of Control to respond to any possible retaliation by the Pakistan Air Force. Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi summoned an emergency meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan to discuss the security situation and asserted that Pakistan reserved the right to retaliate. The prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, convened an emergency meeting to review the situation. At the end of this meeting, the National Security Council (NSC) released a statement denying the Indian claims of the destruction of any terrorist camp and described the attack as \\"uncalled for\\" whilst adding that retaliation would be forthcoming after a joint parliamentary session. He also stated that Pakistan will take international media to the area of strikes but were delayed due to adverse weather conditions. ANI claimed to have released photos of the alleged JeM camp and weapons cache sourced from intelligence sources. Reactions India Foreign diplomats from the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Australia, Indonesia, Turkey, China, and six ASEAN nations were briefed by Indian foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale on the strike conducted. Arun Jaitley, the Indian cabinet minister of Finance stated two reasons, for Pakistan denying the effectiveness of the airstrike stating, \\"There are two plausible reasons. First, the Pakistan army had created a big aura about its prowess among Pakistanis, and it did not want its image dented.\\" Jaitley noted that the second reason was more important, and stated \\"Had the Pakistan army admitted that our fighters bombed its buildings, the first question to be raised would have been: What was the extent of damage? Experts would have come for a survey of the buildings and asked about the people staying inside... then Pakistan would have had to reveal names of the Jaish fighters who died there.\\" International Australia noted its condemnation of Pulwama attack and asked Pakistan to crack down on terrorists operating from its soil. It also asked both India and Pakistan to restrain from actions that would jeopardize peace. China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang stated \\"We hope that both India and Pakistan can exercise restraint and adopt actions that will help stabilize the situation in the region and improve mutual relations\\". France asked both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, saying that it supported Indian actions against terrorism and asked Pakistan to stop allowing its territory to be used by terrorists. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation condemned the airstrike and called on both India and Pakistan to show restraint. United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo termed the attack as a \\"counter-terrorism action\\" and reaffirmed US- India ties. He asked both sides to show restraint.

Franz (born July 3, 1970) is an American politician and conservation attorney from Washington state who serves as the State Commissioner of Public Lands. She is a Democrat who was previously a member of the Bainbridge Island city council and was elected as commissioner in 2016. Early life and education Franz was born in the Pacific Northwest and raised in the area, graduating from St. Mary's Academy in Portland, Oregon, in 1988. She was a competitive ice skater for twelve years as a child and teenager, frequenting the same ice rinks as future Olympian Tonya Harding. Franz graduated from Smith College with a bachelor's degree in English language and government in 1992 and the Northeastern University School of Law with a juris doctor. She practiced as an attorney in the Seattle area from 1997 to 2011, specializing in environmental law and conservation. Political career Franz was elected to the Bainbridge Island city council in 2008 and served one term, during which she lobbied the state government for the establishment of the area's first open water marina at Eagle Harbor. After briefly considering a run for the Washington State House of Representatives, Franz joined Seattle-based conservation organization Futurewise as its director. She served on several regional conservation and land management boards, including committees of the Puget Sound Regional Council. Franz announced her intention to run for State Commissioner of Public Lands in April 2016, looking to fill the seat of retiring commissioner Peter J. Goldmark. She received the early endorsement of Goldmark, as well as former King County Executive Ron Sims and the Bullitt Center. Franz finished second overall during the primary election, advancing to the general election alongside Republican candidate Steve McLaughlin and ahead of seven other Democrats. With the further endorsements of two former governors, U.S. Senator Patty Murray, and a coalition of environmental groups and unions, Franz won 53 percent of the vote in the general election but failed to win any counties in Eastern Washington. Franz was sworn in as Commissioner of Public Lands on January 11, 2017. During the first year of her term, the Department of Natural Resources faced a minor wildfire season caused by prolonged heat similar to those of previous years. The state government prepared a new forest management plan to reduce the effectiveness of future wildfires by introducing new restoration measures and prescribed burns in Eastern Washington to thin out overgrown forests. On August 19, 2017, a fish farm near Cypress Island in Skagit County accidentally released hundreds of thousands of Atlantic salmon. Franz ordered an investigation into the farm and announced that the farm would be removed for various violations of its state license and lease agreement. Franz was also part of the state government's effort to halt federal plans for offshore drilling in the Pacific Ocean near the Olympic Peninsula. The 2018 wildfire season was more severe than the previous year and prompted the state government to declare a state of emergency after the Department of Natural Resources had been overwhelmed in its response to 891 fires by late July. The season had 1,850 recorded fires, setting a new state record, and Franz issued a request to the state legislature for a $55 million budget to expand the department's fire-fighting resources. Franz proposed the hiring of 30 full-time wildland firefighters, the purchase of two helicopters, and the creation of a fire-training academy specifically for wildfires. Personal life Franz has three sons and lived on a farm in Bainbridge Island prior to being elected as commissioner. Her family owns a plot of forestland in Pierce County, Washington, which includes a habitat of Ponderosa pine that is uncommon west of the Cascade Range.

(born Johann Wilhelm Beschter; ; May 20, 1763January 6, 1842) was a Catholic priest and Jesuit from the Duchy of Luxembourg in the Austrian Netherlands. He emigrated to the United States as a missionary in 1807, where he ministered in rural Pennsylvania and Maryland. Beschter was the last Jesuit pastor of St. Mary's Church in Lancaster, as well as the pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. He was also a priest at several other German-speaking churches in Pennsylvania. Beschter's ministerial work was punctuated by a time as master of novices at the new Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland, as well as a brief term as president of Georgetown College in 1829. While in Maryland, he aligned himself with the Continental European Jesuits in the United States, who endorsed a monarchist view of ecclesiastical leadership. After his presidency, Beschter remained at Georgetown for a year as a professor of German, before returning to Paradise, Pennsylvania, where he lived out the last twelve years of his life as a priest.  Early life  Johann Wilhelm Beschter was born on May 20, 1763, in the Duchy of Luxembourg, located in the Austrian Netherlands, a part of the Holy Roman Empire. While little is known about his early life, Archbishop John Carroll reported that, before sailing for the New World from Amsterdam in 1807, Beschter was a pastor and dean in Luxembourg. After arriving in the United States, he was admitted to the Society of Jesus on October 10, 1807, and anglicized his name as John William Beschter. On August 22, 1809, and again on April 21, 1814, he submitted petitions for naturalization while in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  Missionary in the United States   Pennsylvania  In the year of his arrival in the United States, Beschter was assigned as a priest to St. Mary's Church in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. By the following year, he had been made pastor of the church, making him the only Jesuit pastor of St. Mary's following the restoration of the Society in America. Though assigned to St. Mary's, he drew the praise of Archbishop Carroll for simultaneously ministering to three congregations in the area, which comprised American, German, and Irish parishioners. His appointment as pastor quieted an existing quarrel within the parish over the nationality and language of the pastor. Beschter's predecessor, Herman J. Stoecker, was not proficient in English, to the consternation of the Irish congregants. Stoecker had succeeded Francis Fitzsimons, an Irishman who could not speak German, which ruffled the German majority of parishioners. Beschter's proficiency in English as well as his native German made him a satisfactory solution to the dispute. During his pastorate, the church established a mission to Lebanon, Pennsylvania, in 1810, as it had done in other locations throughout the state in the past. Beschter celebrated the laying of the cornerstone of the mission church, named St. Mary of the Assumption, on July 23 of that year. Presiding over the ceremony, he preached in both English and German to a congregation of Catholics and Protestants, which included one Moravian, three Lutheran and three Reformed pastors. Beschter was described as having garnered the support and attachment of the congregation as pastor. Upon the end of his pastorate in 1812, he was replaced by another Irishman, Michael J. Byrne. Though successful as a pastor and a \\"very holy man\\", Carroll found Beschter in \\"want of a better education in the Society\\", as with many of the other foreign Jesuit missionaries in America.  Maryland  Beschter then became involved in the establishment of the Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh, Maryland. Though the Jesuits had an established presence in White Marsh dating to around 1741, it was not until 1814 that serious efforts to establish a new novitiate there were undertaken. Beschter escorted the first group of novices from Frederick, Maryland to the novitiate at White Marsh, where they arrived on July 12, 1814. For some time during that year, he acted as master of novices at White Marsh. He is next noted as having been an assistant curate to Louis de Barth in Conewago in Adams County, Pennsylvania, in 1816. As the Catholic community surrounding Conewago grew, the initially dependent mission churches were granted greater degrees of autonomy, though still retaining an association with Conewago. Beschter was placed in charge of one of theseBrandt Chapelin the Pigeon Hills area of Paradise in York County. Later that year, he was stationed in Frederick, where he remained for two years. By 1818, Beschter had fallen ill and became involved in disagreements with Bishop Michael Egan of Philadelphia, and so left for Georgetown in Washington, D.C. To mark the tercentenary of Martin Luther's writing of the Ninety-five Theses, a pamphlet was published in Philadelphia under Beschter's name titled \\"The Blessed ReformationMartin Luther portrayed by himself\\". In reality, the pamphlet was written by Anthony Kohlmann, who used Beschter's name as a pseudonym. In 1820, Beschter was appointed pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in Baltimore, Maryland, on the site of the present St. Alphonsus Church. Succeeding F. X. Brosius, he led the mostly German congregation until 1828, when he was succeeded by Louis De Barth. Beschter became involved in the tensions stemming from American Jesuits' skepticism of their Continental European counterparts being put in charge of American institutions. He defended the Jesuit Superior General Luigi Fortis' appointment of Polish-born Francis Dzierozynski in 1820 as socius, consultor, and admonitor to Charles Neale (the mission superior for the United States), which vested Dzierozynski with broad authority. He condemned the \\"curious\\" American view that \\"sovereignty rests essentially in the people\\", as well as their opposition to monarchy. On February 2, 1821, the status of gradus in the Society of Jesus was conferred on Beschter. When Dzierozynski was later made mission superior in 1823, Beschter again supported him.  Georgetown College  alt=Georgetown University in 1829 In 1828, Beschter was transferred to Georgetown College as minister. When William Feiner was permitted to resign the presidency in 1829 (he had contracted tuberculosis, to which he would succumb by June), Beschter was appointed president of Georgetown College, assuming office on March 31 of that year. His selection came as a surprise and was met with opposition by the Anglo-American laymen, who claimed Beschter was not fluent in speaking or writing in English, despite the fact that he was competent enough to preach in English. They further asserted that he had no knowledge of the operation of a college. Likewise, nativist Jesuits opposed the leadership of Georgetown by such foreigners as Anthony Kohlmann, Stephen Dubuisson, and Beschter. The school fared well during his presidency, compared to the several preceding years, and counted 45 enrolled students. That year, Georgetown opened St. John's Literary Institution as an offshoot in Frederick, which was placed under the charge of John McElroy, and whose cornerstone had been laid on August7 of the previous year. While at Georgetown, Beschter became a friend of Susan Decatur, a convert to Catholicism and the widow of Stephen Decatur. Following the end of his presidency, he was succeeded by Thomas F. Mulledy on September 14, 1829. Beschter remained at Georgetown in 1830 as a professor of German.  Later years  After retiring from Georgetown in 1830, Beschter returned to the Brandt Chapel at Paradise, Pennsylvania, which continued to be a mission of Conewago. He lived out the remainder of his life in Paradise. In his last year, Beschter was assisted by Phillip Sacchi, who lived with him in Paradise. Beschter died there on January 6, 1842, and his body was taken to the Conewago Chapel to be interred.

Description  C. profunda has been observed possessing a long conical shaped skeleton with holes over the entire body of the skeleton. They possess a single pseudopod which will extend from the tip of the conical structure. Like all species of radiolarian, C. profunda secretes a siliceous external skeleton and will contribute to the building of Siliceous ooze on the ocean floor once it dies. Their bodies are often found beneath this layer of \\"marine snow\\" in the sediments of oceans around the globe.Nigrini C.A. 1967. Radiolaria in pelagic sediments from the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Bull. Scripps Inst. Oceanogr., 11:1-125.Riedel W.R. 1958. Radiolaria in Antarctic sediments. Rep. B.A.N.Z. Ant. Res. Exp. 1929-31, B, 6(10):219-255. They are considered to be Holoplankton and can be found living primarily at depths greater than 300 meters in all oceans, though they can be found at different depths.Giblin, J. 2017. Selected Radiolarians as Paleoceanographic Proxies in the Central West Pacific Warm Pool (MD97-2140) Over the Past 242,000 Years \\"Master's Thesis\\". Retrieved from http://digilib.library.usp.ac.fj/gsdl/collect/usplibr1/index/assoc/HASH2f5f.dir/doc.pdf Due to a lack of research and the fragile nature of radiolarian skeletons, it is unknown what C. profunda does for food. Some radiolarians are filter feeders, some are hunters using their pseudopodia to capture prey, and some even have symbionts when living in higher waters. It is estimated that radiolarians within the class Polycystina live for approximately 1‚Äì2 months.  Potential uses  C. profunda, as well as several other radiolarian species, have been observed in a variety of marine environments. Since radiolarians are holoplanktonic, they can easily be moved around by currents that are moving in the water. These, as well as others, could be used to track water masses as they move through the world's oceans.

An African American, his show featured black performers during the segregation era, and he came to be described as \\"one of the first African- Americans to find great success and infamy in the outdoor entertainment industry\\". Claxton also built a resort hotel for African Americans in Tampa, Florida. Biography Claxton was born in Memphis, Tennessee. His father, Overton (O.C.) Claxton, was a drummer who played in W. C. Handy's band. When young, Leon joined Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus as a water boy for the elephants, and toured the U.S.. By the age of 16, he appeared in shows as a contortionist, and in the 1920s featured in vaudeville shows in Chicago. By the early 1930s, he had begun producing shows with African American entertainers, including the Cotton Club Showboat at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago in 1934. He took over responsibility for the colored section of the Royal American Shows,\\"Top Negro Road Show Producer Leon Claxton Dies In Tampa\\", Jet, November 30, 1967, pp.58-59 and debuted his first girl show, Hep Cats, in 1936. His Harlem In Havana shows, incorporating music, dancing and comedy, became the main feature of the Royal American Shows, which toured widely in the U.S. and Canada. The shows were performed in Claxton's 1,600-seater tent during the summer season, and in winter played in nightclubs and theaters. Claxton settled in Tampa, Florida, where he built the Claxton Manor hotel. It was one of a small number of hotels for African American performers, athletes, and business people in the American South. Claxton won Tampa's Citizen of the Year Award in 1959. As part of the Dads Club, he was part of a donation of cooled water drinking fountains to Blake High School. Claxton married Gwendolyn Bates in Saskatoon, Canada, in 1938. She became co- producer of his shows. He died in Tampa in 1967.

He is known for his work on Occupy Wall Street, Randyland, Social journalism, and as a YouTube personality. Personal life Foo Conner was born in Charleston, West Virginia. He grew up on a small subsistence farm right outside of the city in Mink Shoals, West Virginia. His father was a photojournalist for United Press International and taught Foo the craft at an early age. Although he has been called Foo since childhood, Conner officially changed his name to Foo in 2018. Foo squats an otherwise abandoned house to advocate for housing rights. Touring bands often play there. In February 2016, babies born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania were gifted prints of Foo's artwork. Career Conner got his start producing free punk rock festivals at Skatopia. The anti- authoritarian atmosphere of his events caught the attention of Rolling Stone. Upon hearing the call to protest, he became a core organizer for Occupy Wall Street movement speaking out against Economic inequality. On the weekends he co-hosts the G3AR YouTube channel, where they build super hero gadgets and test them similar to the Mythbusters. The channel has amassed over 500,000 subscribers. In 2016 he added to his many roles becoming the co-director of Randyland, an outsider art museum promoting happiness. Occupy Wall Street In 2011, Foo helped plan the Occupy movement online. He would move to Zucotti Park in the fall. Though a leaderless movement, Conner would be recognized as a core organizer and speak on behalf of the movement. During his time at Occupy, Conner played rolls in the social media strategy and coordinate street protests. Towards the end, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Chris Hedges told Conner, \\"a real activist would get into the news\\". Conner would use his experiences and that advice to go on to found Jekko, a news website covering current events and technology news. Journalism Foo is a prolific journalist covering upwards of five hundred events a year through social media. Conner's society photography is reminiscent of late American photographer Bill Cunningham who took candid photos and traveled to events by bicycle. The uniqueness of the style has led other society columns to occasionally mention if Conner attends an event. In 2016, he was nominated for Blogger of the Year at Style Week Pittsburgh. He is known for his gonzo journalism \\"activistartist-journalist\\" style. His work aims for a neutral point of view. This applies to his technology commentary too, which he has been doing for over a decade.

The GeneCard for KIAA0408 is pictured below.https://genecards.weizmann.ac.il/v3/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=KIAA0408  Variants and Aliases  KIAA0408 has at least 11 spliced variants.1 Aliases include C6orf174andKIAA0408, FLJ43995, RP3-403A15.2,dJ403A15.3, C6orf174, LOC 9729, jajer, barspoyby, gyperbu.1 It has been described as hypothetical protein LOC9729, OTTHUMP00000017174, and hypothetical protein LOC 387104.1 UniProtKB refers to it as K0408_HUMAN,Q6ZU52.  Expression  KIAA0408 appears to be expressed highest in the brain, fat, and lung tissues. KIAA0408 is also associated with the hippocampus which primarily helps with releasing hormones and regulates body temperature. In humans, this gene is expressed in leukocytes, the hypothalamus, glioblastoma cells, prechondrocytes, placental CD14+ giant cells, estrogen receptor alpha-silenced MCF7 breast cancer cells.1 I n rats, KIAA0408 is expressed at higher levels in rats eating carbohydrate-whey protein hydrosylate diets in comparison to rats eating carbohydrate amino acid diets. Glioblastoma pseudopalisading cells are associated with necrosis. Based on the second figure, it appears that KIAA0408 is more highly expressed in tumor cells than in pseudopalisading cells.  Regulation of Expression  According to the SUMO-sumoylation prediction in ExPASy, it appears that there are four motifs with a high probability of sumoylation. KIAA0408 has one O-glycosylation site predicted at serine 386. The gene has a large amount of predicted phosphorylation sites.  Protein  KIAA0408 has 694 amino acids and a molecular weight of 79.2 kdal. 12.0% of the protein has levels of serine that are higher than average. These results also indicate that at a neutral pH, my protein tends to be more basic. Evidence collected from Expasy suggests that KIAA0408 could potentially be involved in solute. The tertiary structure of KIAA0408 consists largely of coiled-coiled regions. It is predicted with high certainty that KIAA0408 is found in the nucleus. A conceptual translation is included in this page.  Interacting Proteins  KIAA0408 has 42 total interacting proteins.  Orthologs  The ortholog space extends from mammals to birds. There are no paralogs. All birds had very little variation in gene length, % identity, and % similarity. The two turtles that had the gene were also similar in those areas. All mammals aside from the lemur and the monkey had around the same gene lengths, % identity, and % similarity. The lemur and the monkey varied from each other. Human and mouse KIAA0408 are 53.531% similar and have 149 similar positions. There is a large region that is missing in mouse in the C-terminus, and another smaller chunk missing in the N-terminus. This could be an evolutionary sign of humans‚Äô erroneous development of more genes to make them more complex individuals. The areas before and after both deletions are highly conserved, so these are likely very critical regions of the gene.  Clinical Significance  KIAA0408 is highly expressed in the brain, but has also been found in tissue of the breast, testes, eye, kidney, and T-lymphocytes, and over 50 other tissues.1 It was found to be upregulated in comparisons between the following clinical features: new tumor/no new tumor, pathologic M1/M0, and presence or absence of cancer.4 The table in the paper is unclear as to which features the upregulation is correlated to.4 KIAA0408 was also listed in a genetic testing registry.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/tests/542520/interpretation/ This protein can be tested for mutations which would indicate \\"hereditary disease\\". There was no specific information provided on what hereditary diseases it can test for. KIAA0408 is also part of a list of gene transcripts \\"...whose expression levels are positively correlated with age.\\"  References   External links   * Category:Proteins Category:Genes on human chromosome 6 ","title":"KIAA0408"},{"id":"60075968","text":"Katip Sumat uprising () was a revolt in 19th century Southern Vietnam.

The Vietnamese force fed haram lizard and pig meat to Cham Muslims and cow meat to Cham Hindus against their will. It made Chams angry. In June 1833, Katip Sumat, a Cham Muslim leader who lived in Kelantan, came to Champa, declaring jihad against the Vietnamese. He was defeated in July and fled to Cambodia before escaping to Malaya.

Her work has been shown at the Gracie Mansion, the Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, and will be at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in spring 2019.  Early life  Colomba was born in √àpinay-sur-Seine, where her parents had immigrated to from Martinique. She began painting early, making watercolors as a child to decorate her parents' Caribbean restaurant. As a teenager, she read The Image of the Black in Western Art by John and Dominique de Menil, which inspired her to paint a portrait of her great- grandmother in the style of Whistler‚Äôs Mother. She continued study the paintings of Louvre, especially the Dutch masters, and attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1998, she moved to Los Angeles and worked in storyboarding and illustration for the film industry.  Paintings  Colomba started spending time in New York in 2007 to further her painting career, and moved to the city permanently in 2011. She met artist Deborah Willis in 2010 after Willis saw one of her paintings at the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, and Willis helped her enter the New York art world. In 2016, she had a solo exhibition of works at the Long Gallery in Harlem, which The New Yorker described as \\"opulent portraits of black women [that] redress the erasures of women of color in nineteenth-century art history.\\" In 2018, she painted Laure (Portrait of a Negresse) which is a reinterpretation of a painting by Edouard Manet which has the same title and was done in 1863-1863.

Johnson Tropical Medical Center is the only hospital in American Samoa, and is located in Faga'alu, Maoputasi County. It has been ranked among the best hospitals in the Pacific Ocean. It is home to an emergency room and there are doctors on duty at all hours.Swaney, Deanna (1994). Samoa: Western Samoa and American Samoa. Lonely Planet. Page 161. . It is a 150-bed facility. It includes TB, leprosy and obstetric units.Miles, J.A.R. (1984). Public Health Progress in the Pacific: Geographical Background and Regional Development. Springer Science & Business Media. Page 167. . The hospital was built in 1968 and is operating under a $50 million budget as of 2017. The executive director is Taufete'e John Faumuina. History The government condemned nearly twenty acres for a new hospital in Faga'alu Valley in the 1960s. The total estimated cost of the project was $3.5 million. The Lyndon Baines Johnson (LBJ) Tropical Medical Center opened on June 6, 1968. The first admitted patient was a baby about to be delivered. He received the name Lyndon. Soon after its start, the hospital was acclaimed to be the best medical facility in the region. The opening staff consisted of 300 locals and a small cadre of stateside professionals.Sunia, Fofo I.F. (2009). A History of American Samoa. Amerika Samoa Humanities Council. Page 286. . A 1971 study found the hospital services offered at LBJ to be compared favorably with services offered in the mainland at health care facilities of comparable size. The government began sending more students for training in New Zealand and Fiji, and nurses for RN training in Hawai'i. New programs in the 1970s offered maternal and child health education, health statistics, chronic and communicable disease control, filariasis control, and mental health. In 1978, the Maternal Child Health and Crippled Children Services were introduced. Renal dialysis equipment arrived and a special unit was organized. It soon became one of the most valuable additions to local healing services as kidney diseases increased. Women's Auxiliary later emerged and provided equipment and other forms of assistance to medical and nursing staff.Sunia, Fofo I.F. (2009). A History of American Samoa. Amerika Samoa Humanities Council. Page 308. . On Aug. 23, 1982, the hospital announced new changes to the prices: in- patient, $20 per day; out-patient, $2 per visit; for uninsured patients: in- patient, $201 per day; out-patient, $5.70 per visit. Director of Health Dr. Nofo Siliga claimed the revenues were needed in order to pay for improvements, purchase better equipment, and hire more physicians. The negative reaction was immediate and the Legislature held meetings regarding hospital prices. The Cancer Society joined LBJ in a breast cancer awareness campaign. In October 1983, an updating of the major indicators of territorial health status showed significant improvement in every major area. American Samoans were living longer than ever before, premature deaths were lower, and there was a significant reduction in the incidence of several important preventable diseases. The mortality rate was the lowest of all five inhabited U.S. territories.Sunia, Fofo I.F. (2009). A History of American Samoa. Amerika Samoa Humanities Council. Page 327. . In September 2019, it was reported in Samoa News that hospital CEO Faumuina John Faumuina had informed local lawmakers of challenges with recruiting Samoan doctors and nurses. The hospital's proposed budget for the fiscal year 2020 totaled $50.78 million, which is a $68,500 decrease from the approved FY 2019 budget. As of September 2019, LBJ's debt was about $5 million. Its largest revenue sources as of 2019 were $16 million from Medicaid, $8 million in subsidies from the U.S. Department of the Interior, and $10 million from Medicare.

Church Militant is a Catholic lay apostolate and traditional Catholic news website founded by Michael Voris. It was known as Real Catholic TV until 2012, when the Archdiocese of Detroit notified Michael Voris and Real Catholic TV that \\"it does not regard them as being authorized to use the word 'Catholic' to identify or promote their public activities\\". Mr. Voris responded by changing the name to Church Militant. While Church Militant makes use of a paywall and offers premium content to subscribers, the website's most well known feature is its free segment The Vortex, simulcast on YouTube and hosted by Voris. As of December 2018, 34 employees create videos and write content for Church Militant.  Name  The site is named after the Catholic doctrinal division of the universal Church into the Church Militant, Church Penitent, and Church Triumphant.  Influence  Owing to its wide viewership among traditional Catholics, Church Militant expos√©es have been reported to cause deplatforming of liberal Catholics, such as in the case of Dan Schutte, who was disinvited from a concert after a Vortex segment accused him of being a homosexual. Also \\"relentlessly\\" targeted has been Fr. James Martin, whose book Building a Bridge proved controversial among traditional Catholics, which some, including Martin himself, have speculated has led to him being disinvited from speaking engagements. Church Militant, along with other Catholic publications, were accused by Micheal Sean Winters and other Catholic journalists as playing a role in the \\"forced\\" resignation from Catholic News Service of Tony Spence, its editor-in-chief, owing to his opposition towards proposed bathroom bill legislation. Church Militant has been highly critical of the Society of Saint Pius X in articles on its website, in particular of the Society's handling of sexual abuse cases. In April 2020, it published a number of accusations, including some older ones, on its website. (Further allegations were published in August.) In response, the Society criticized Church Millitant, writing that \\"it is well- known that Church Militant is not a serious journalistic enterprise but a repository of sensationalized stories, hit pieces, and videos featuring the opinions of its controversial founder, Michael Voris. Further, Church Militant has repeatedly used the SSPX‚Äôs name to generate web-clicks and revenue while hoping to stoke the fires of public controversy by baiting it into a war of words. Prudence dictates caution when dealing with a tabloid, and we will not be so baited\\". Coverage by other news sources Samuel Freedman of The New York Times said, \\"To fully grasp what 'church militant' means in this highly politicized atmosphere, it helps to examine the broader movement and the role of a traditionalist Catholic website called ‚Äî to no surprise ‚Äî ChurchMilitant.com\\". Freedman quoted an interview with Michael Voris on which his article was based accusing Church Militant's alleged \\"right-wing stances\\" as \\"mesh[ing] with many of the positions espoused by Mr. Trump and his inner circle\\". Freedman summarized Voris' views by claiming that \\"the website's positions were a righteous defense of patriotism and morality on behalf of people who believe those virtues have been attacked by liberals, secularists and global elites\\". Freedman relayed that Voris' online audience was cumulatively \\"about 1.5 million views a month\\" and characterized the apostolate's position as one that dismisses manmade climate change, thinks the Black Lives Matter movement is akin to \\"the new fascism\\", and called Hillary Clinton \\"Killary,\\" who was acting as \\"Satan's mop for wiping up the last remaining resistance to him in America.\\" It also quoted Voris's critique of social-welfare programs as a system where \\"half the people of America\\" do not pay taxes and \\"get things handed to them\\". Church Militant responded to The Times article in a panel discussion in which the panel called Freedman's article a \\"hit piece\\" and \\"dishonest\\". On February 19, 2017, Robert Allen, in a piece for the Detroit Free Press which was republished by USA Today, wrote that Voris' studio in Ferndale was \\"the nerve center for a growing, religious group hoping the forces that elected President Donald Trump will tear down the wall between church and state\\". He called Voris' apostolate \\"a fringe group claiming to be Catholic but denounced by the church, [that] broadcasts pro- life, anti-gay, anti-feminist, Islam-fearing content on its website\\" and that \\"many of Church Militant's headlines are similar to those on Breitbart News, the far-right news organization that White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon previously ran.\\" Voris, according to the article, proclaimed that the election of Trump showed that the notion of mainstream media has been altered, \\"The Entire established order has been thrown up into the air. What we say now has some credence. We're allowed into the discussion.\\" Church Militant responded to the Detroit Free Press/USA Today article in a panel discussion in which it also addressed the Detroit archdiocese. On May 9, 2017 The Atlantic released a video on the operations at Church Militant, featuring interviews with Michael Voris and behind the scenes footage at their offices.

Emulating Jack Kerouac's On the Road, Ross Goodwin drove from New York to New Orleans in March 2017 with an AI in a laptop hooked up to various sensors, whose output the AI turned into words that were printed on rolls of receipt paper. The novel was published in 2018 by Jean Bo√Æte √âditions. Goodwin left the text unedited. Although he felt the prose was \\"choppy\\", and contained typographical errors, he wanted to present the machine-generated text verbatim, for future study. The story begins: \\"It was nine seventeen in the morning, and the house was heavy\\". Concept and execution Emulating Jack Kerouac's novel On the Road, Ross Goodwin traveled from New York to New Orleans in March 2017 with the AI, in the form of a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. Three sensors provided real-world input: a surveillance camera mounted on the trunk was trained on the passing scenery, a microphone picked up conversations inside the car, and the Global Positioning System (GPS) tracked the car's location. Input from these sources, and the time provided by the computer's internal clock, was fed into the AI program, which in turn generated sentences on rolls of receipt paper. The car was a Cadillac; Goodwin explained later he wanted an \\"authoritative\\" car (and was unable to get a Crown Vic), and worried that people might think him a terrorist if they saw the car with its electronics and wires. Google paid part of the cost, having become interested in Goodwin's work at New York University. Accompanying him were five other people (including his sister and his fiancee), and the Cadillac was followed by a film crew which documented the four-day journey; the documentary was directed by Lewis Rapkin. Input and output The AI program had been trained to sample fiction in preparation for the novel-writing journey. Goodwin fed it three different text corpora, each with about 20 million words--one with poetry, one with science fiction, and one with \\"bleak\\" writing, in Goodwin's words. It had also been fed a data set from Foursquare; the AI recognized locations from Foursquare, and appended commentaries to them. The conversations captured inside the car were rendered in mutated fashion. The locations provided by the GPS were outputted verbatim, to open the day's writing. The AI generated the novel letter by letter. Due to continual input from the GPS and time clock, the novel often mentions the latitude, longitude, and time of day. It was printed unedited and thus is \\"choppy\\", according to Goodwin; typos were retained, since he wanted to show the text \\"in its most raw form\\". He believes the AI is capable of writing literature, but still feels responsible for the guidance and ownership of the content. Goodwin says his main purpose for this novel is to reveal the way machines create words: \\"In the future when this text becomes more sophisticated it's a warning. If you see patterns like this, it may not have been written by a human\\". Reviews Thomas Hornigold, writing for Singularity Hub, concluded that the AI is no Jack Kerouac, but that \\"you might see, in the odd line, the flickering ghost of something like consciousness, a deeper understanding\\". Brian Merchant, writing in The Atlantic, read the entire novel in one sitting. He could not recognize a coherent plot or story arc, but saw \\"plenty of pixelated poetry in its ragtag assemblage of modern American imagery. And there are some striking and memorable lines\\". Ross Goodwin biography Ross Goodwin, a former ghostwriter for the Obama administration and a creative technologist, has often used neural networks to create poetry and screenplays. Notable works include the short film Sunspring, starring Thomas Middleditch and directed by Goodwin's frequent collaborator Oscar Sharp, and Word.Camera, an 1885 bellows camera that outputs poetry about whatever it is pointed at when the button is pressed. His Master's Thesis at New York University was a project called \\"Narrated Reality\\", for which he walked around the city with a backpack containing compass, punch clock, and camera; data from these devices was fed into an LSTM neural network whose output was \\"weird associative poetry\\".

On 10 January 2019, Venezuela's opposition-majority National Assembly declared that incumbent Nicol√°s Maduro's 2018 reelection was invalid, and its president, Juan Guaid√≥, said that he was prepared to assume the acting presidency. On 23 January 2019, Guaid√≥ declared that he was acting president during a rally in Caracas and took the presidential oath. Maduro's government has accused the United States of organizing a coup d'√©tat to remove him and take control of the country's oil reserves. Guaid√≥ rejects the characterization of his actions as a coup, saying that his movement is backed by peaceful volunteers. Some countries and organizations have recognized Guaid√≥ as acting president, while others have recognized Maduro; some have expressed neutrality, and some have supported the National Assembly without endorsing Guaid√≥.  Reactions  Washington, D.C. public assembly After Maduro's inauguration in January, United States National Security Advisor John R. Bolton, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Andr√©s Manuel Obrador (Mexican President) and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called him an illegitimate dictator. International demonstrations occurred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protested in more than 70 cities around the world in support of Guaid√≥, and demonstrations in support of Maduro also took place.  Governments   International  : During the presidency of Mauricio Macri, Argentina recognized Guaid√≥ as the legitimate President of Venezuela and repeatedly denounced Maduro as a 'dictatorship'. After the 2019 elections, when Alberto Fern√°ndez took office, Argentina stopped recognizing Guaid√≥ as President and withdrew credentials to his ambassador in the country. Argentina, however, refused to recognize Nicol√°s Maduro's envoy as well. After Guaid√≥ and other opposition representatives were refused entry into the National Assembly in January 2020, Argentina labeled the move by Maduro's supporters as \\"unacceptable\\". In a July 2020 report by the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights, Argentina toughened its position on the Maduro's government and signed a petition for fresh elections and denounced violations to human rights in the country. : Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said that he would do all he could to \\"re- establish order, democracy and freedom\\" in Venezuela. The Bolsonaro administration declared on 12 January 2019 that it recognizes Juan Guaid√≥ as the legitimate president of Venezuela. : During a town hall at Brock University at St. Catharines, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, denounced Maduro as an 'illegitimate dictator' and said anyone should stand up and condemn the Maduro government, which he said has been responsible for ‚Äúterrible oppression‚Äù and a humanitarian crisis unseen in South America for decades. : China was originally forthcoming with support to Maduro with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying stating that China \\"supports efforts made by the Venezuelan government to protect the country‚Äôs sovereignty, independence, and stability\\" and \\"opposes foreign forces from interfering into Venezuela affairs\\". In early February there were reports that it was taking a more neutral position for fear of alienating potential relationships in major South America countries which support of Guaid√≥, as well as due to frustration with Venezuela's inability to repay debt, China having lent Venezuela $67 billion USD. Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, stated that China's trade deals would not be affected ‚Äúno matter how circumstances change,\\" and further stated that China has been in talks with \\"all sides\\". There also has been evidence of discontent in China's public over the amounts of money that have been given to Venezuela, which some state would be better used in China. According to the Wall Street Journal, China has been holding meetings with diplomats from the government of Guaid√≥ to discuss Chinese investments in Venezuela; a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman denied these claims, stating that it is \\"false information\\". On 8 March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed China's opposition to the issued sanctions, and support for dialogue between Venezuela's opposition and government. On 5 June, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that his country is ready to work with the international community to play a constructive role with Venezuela and help the country to get back on a normal development path as soon as possible while opposing foreign interference, unilateral sanctions, the use of force, or threats of the use of force when it comes to the current situation. Moreover, President Xi said that the current crisis should be solved by the ruling party and the opposition through inclusive political dialogue and consultation within the framework of Venezuela's constitution. : Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman stated that Iran \\"supports Venezuela's [Maduro] government and nation against any kind of foreign interference in its internal affairs\\". : Russia has been a vocal supporter of Nicolas Maduro, as well as being a military and economic ally since under predecessor Hugo Ch√°vez. Russia has made shows of force, such as flying two Tu-160 nuclear capable bombers to Venezuela. In addition to direct support Russia also acts vocal supporter of Maduro in the UN, and has been one of the country's principal arms dealers. Domestic reactions in Russia to the situation have been mixed with some publications praising Russia's support of Maduro and its willingness to confront the US, and others criticizing economic aid to Venezuela which they deem an economic black hole. The Russian national oil company Rosneft has invested heavily in numerous joint ventures with Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA. Rosneft has made direct investments in six Venezuelan oil fields totaling around $2.5 billion USD. Rosneft has also acted as a major lender, and oil marketer for Venezuela aiding it in selling 225,000 barrels per day in crude supplies overseas. It has made large loans to the company with $2.7 billion USD outstanding; to offset risk PDVSA has pledged a 49.9% stake of subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loans outstanding. On 5 June 2019, following talks with China's President Xi Jinping, President Vladimir Putin wished the situation in Venezuela to stabilize. : Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan phoned Maduro to offer support. According to Haaretz, \\"Erdogan pledged to invest in Venezuelan's failing economy during the trip, with Maduro saying that Turkish businesses would pump some 4.5 billion euros into the country.\\" On 1 April, Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu told his Venezuelan counterpart Jorge Arreaza that Turkey will continue supporting the Maduro government and deepen its cooperation \\"in all fields\\" despite pressure from the United States. However, in August 2019, Ziraat Bank, Turkey's largest bank by assets, stopped offering services to the Central Bank of Venezuela. Elliott Abrams, a former foreign policy official under the Reagan and Bush administrations, was appointed the United States' Special Envoy to Venezuela (US): On 15 January, US President Donald Trump was reported to be deliberating whether to officially recognize Guaid√≥, which he did on 23 January. US Vice President Mike Pence released a video on 23 January in support of Guaid√≥ and the people of Venezuela. The US was the first nation to recognize Guaid√≥ after he swore an oath on the 23rd, with Trump and Pence sending their support and solidarity as well as the official recognition; other countries followed suit. In response Maduro ordered the expulsion of US diplomats, giving them 72 hours to leave Venezuela. The US said it would not close its embassy, stating their diplomatic relationship was with Guaid√≥'s government, and holding Maduro responsible for the safety of its staff. On 26 January 2019, only hours before the deadline, the Maduro government backtracked on its expulsion order, giving US diplomats another 30 days. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Elliott Abrams as US Special Envoy to Venezuela. On 28 January, the US imposed sanctions on PDVSA. The US accounted for 41% of purchases from the company, which is the biggest input to Venezuela's economy. On 22 February‚Äîthe same day as the Venezuela Aid Live concert, which Maduro said was part of an effort to topple him‚ÄîVenezuela extended the deadline for US diplomats to leave by another 30 days. On 12 March, the US announced that it was withdrawing its diplomats from Caracas. : Corriere della Sera cited a leaked copy of a private letter reportedly sent by Pope Francis to Maduro on 7 February 2019 in reply to a letter Maduro wrote asking the pope to mediate. Pope Francis' response‚Äîaddressed to \\"His Excellency Mr Nicol√°s Maduro Moros\\"‚Äîsaid that what had been agreed in earlier negotiations had not been followed. Those conditions, still applicable, were: open a channel for humanitarian aid, hold free elections, free political prisoners, and re-establish the constitutionally-elected National Assembly. According to Andrea Gagliarducci, writing for the Catholic News Agency, in not addressing Maduro as president, the Pope was agreeing with the stance taken by the Venezuelan bishops, who hold that Maduro's election was illegitimate.  Intergovernmental organizations  Guaid√≥ communication to embassies in Venezuela: I am responsible for telling them that we are a sovereign nation and will continue to maintain diplomatic relations with all the countries of the world (EU): More than half of its member states, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Spain, said they support Guaid√≥; earlier, the EU issued a declaration saying it \\"fully supports the National Assembly as the democratically elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected\\". On 4 February 19 countries of the European Union made a joint declaration supporting and recognizing Juan Guaid√≥ as acting president of Venezuela, asking that he \\"summons free, just and democratic presidential elections\\". Italy's stance prevented this from becoming an official EU position. The EU condemned the Constituent Assembly stripping of Guaid√≥'s parliamentary immunity, calling the action a \\"serious violation of the Venezuelan constitution, as well as of the rule of law and separation of power\\". Lima Group: On 11 and 12 January, several nations of the Lima Group released statements independent from the international body, including their nations' agreement to not recognize Maduro. The Maduro government said that these countries had \\"rectified\\" themselves to support him as president. They had not; the non-intervention statements were seen as a concession to prevent rash action by Maduro after he broadly threatened the group. Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Jorge Arreaza, gave a different statement to the vice presidential office, saying that Venezuela had received diplomatic notices from some Lima Group countries about the original dispute. Colombia's statement reiterated the group's resolution and pledged to support \\"the restoration of democracy and constitutional order in Venezuela\\", as well as saying that they did not have a position on the territorial dispute. Arreaza contradicted the statement from his vice president's office that the Lima Group recognized Maduro's government, and doubled Maduro's 48-hour demand period for non-intervention for the remaining countries after it expired. He also advocated peaceful diplomatic discussion with neighboring countries. The group‚Äîexcept for Mexico, which called for non-intervention in Venezuelan internal affairs‚Äîcontinued to back the Guaid√≥ government, with the Foreign Minister of Chile pledging \\"unlimited support\\". International Conference on the Situation in Venezuela: Mexico and Uruguay announced an international conference for countries with a neutral position in Montevideo on 7 February. Uruguay has since recognized Maduro as president, with foreign minister Rodolfo Nin Novoa comparing the worsening situation to the United States' rationale for the Iraq War. In April, Beatriz Becerra said that the international conference had been of no use, given that there had been no progress on the 90-day deadline for elections that the group established when it was formed; she stated that the Contact Group should be terminated and efforts should be coordinated through the Lima Group. : During a July 2019 summit in Santa Fe, Argentina, the bloc called for \\"free, fair and transparent presidential elections, as soon as possible\\" in Venezuela. The presidents of the four member countries signed a statement expressing concern \\"for the grave crisis that Venezuela is going through, which is seriously affecting the humanitarian situation and human rights.\\" Venezuela's membership of the bloc has been suspended indefinitely since 1 December 2016 in response to the \\"rupture of the democratic order\\" in that country. (OAS): The OAS approved a resolution on 10 January 2019 \\"to not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term\\". Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS, recognized Guaid√≥ on 23 January. In an extraordinary OAS session called for 24 January 16 countries including the US recognized Guaid√≥ as president, but they did not achieve the majority needed for a resolution. Almagro held countries who remained neutral on the presidential crisis responsible for the massacre, suffering, and human rights violations in Venezuela. (UN): A special meeting of the Security Council was held on 26 January to discuss Venezuela; no consensus was reached. Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres called for dialogue to ease tensions. Delegates from Maduro's government continued to represent Venezuela at the United Nations. On 14 February 2019, a group of UN delegates, including delegates of Venezuela and several other countries, declared they would fight what they called the \\"illicit, US-led effort\\" to change the government of Venezuela. They accused the US of \\"using sanctions and emergency aid as political weapons against Venezuelans\\". On 28 February the Security Council voted on two draft resolutions: one from the US calling for new elections in Venezuela, the entry of humanitarian aid, and the recognition of Guaid√≥ as interim president; the other from Russia calling for dialogue between the Maduro government and the opposition in line with the Montevideo initiative of Mexico and Uruguay. Neither proposal was adopted. The US draft received majority support (nine votes in favor to three against), but was vetoed by Russia and China. The Russian draft received four votes in favor and seven votes against.  National organizations  Tibisay Lucena, president of the National Electoral Council (CNE), Translation of Almagro's testimony to US Senate available from OAS: \\"All the members of the current illegitimate government are responsible and the role of the President of the National Electoral Council Tibisay Lucena has been crucial in the institutional collapse. The formula announced by Tibisay Lucena to the National Constituent Assembly is as technically absurd as it is unconstitutional and undemocratic. The convocation of the Constituent Assembly is taking place outside of that stipulated in article 347 of the Constitution, which states 'The Venezuelan people are the only ones who possess the original constituent power.' People like Tibisay Lucena, that continue stripping democracy of its content, work to serve the consolidation of the interests of the dictatorship imposed through the suffering of its people, sustained by the killing of its people, by the political imprisonment of opposition leaders and by torture.\\" described Guaid√≥'s declaration as a coup d'etat and said that his actions were carried out by a group of foreign governments, subordinated to the guidelines of the United States government that seeks to undermine Venezuela's sovereignty. She also defended the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election results, saying that \\"the positions of popular representation are elected by the people\\". The Catholic Church in Venezuela, organized by the Episcopal Conference of Venezuela, released a statement by Monsignor Ovidio P√©rez Morales on 15 January 2019 saying \\"The Church in Venezuela, united to its Bishops in communion with the Pope, declare the socialist-communist regime illegitimate and stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people to rescue democracy, freedom, and justice. Trusting in God, they support the National Assembly\\". Cardinal Porras declared: ‚ÄúThis regime always calls for dialogue when it‚Äôs up to its neck in water but when the water level falls it forgets about it.\\" Members of the Constituent National Assembly stated that Guaid√≥'s actions on 23 February solidified their support of Maduro. Social media  Despite internet blocks in Venezuela, by midday local time, the Twitter hashtag \\"#23Ene\\"‚Äîshorthand for \\"23 de Enero\\", Spanish for 23 January‚Äîwas trending worldwide. Later in the day, five of the top ten trends were protest-related: \\"Venezuela\\", \\"Juan Guaid√≥\\", \\"#23Ene\\", \\"#GritemosConBrio\\", and \\"#Guaido\\". With protests continuing to the next day, \\"#24Ene\\" also trended. It was reported in the late evening that Instagram had removed the \\"Verified\\" label from Maduro's account, instead placing one on Guaid√≥'s account; this was denied by Instagram. Guaid√≥'s description had also been updated to include \\"President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\\". The following day, Facebook un-verified Maduro. In January 2019, the Associated Press said that Maduro's administration and Venezuela's state-run media sought to discredit Guaid√≥ with video footage \\"to paint [him] as a liar and a fraud\\". Venezuela's Communications Minister, Jorge Rodr√≠guez, said he had proof of a meeting between Guaid√≥ and United Socialist Party of Venezuela members, Diosdado Cabello and Freddy Bernal, in which Guaid√≥ allegedly said he was under pressure from the United States. According to Guaid√≥, the meeting never happened. Rodr√≠guez' proof came as collated short video clips. One clip shows Cabello walking through a hotel lobby, then cuts to show a man in a hooded sweatshirt (alleged to be Guaid√≥) entering and crossing the hall in the same direction as Cabello. The hooded man is heavily obscured and blurry, and it is impossible to identify the person. Within minutes of Venezuela's state-run media posting the video, the hashtag #GuaidoChallenge went viral, trending worldwide. The hashtag made fun of the video posted by Rodr√≠guez as supposed proof of this meeting. On 27 January, Guaid√≥ held a public assembly and again challenged the Maduro administration to produce evidence of the alleged meeting. According to a translation on Caracas Chronicles, he said, \\"Show whatever you want, fabrications, with hoodie, without hoodie, audios. You confuse nobody here, the people see clearly.\\" As a protest about what they called foreign intervention, pro-Maduro social-media users used the hashtag '#HandsOffVenezuela' to share videos, pictures, and comments. China, a supporter of Maduro, has censored information about the crisis according to Radio Free Asia. Reports from China state that Chinese citizens who criticize Maduro on social media are punished or fined, with economist He Jiangbing saying that the Chinese government is \\"trying to prevent another color revolution ... because Venezuela and China are very similar\\". Turkish pro- government media outlets criticized European countries for issuing an eight- day election ultimatum, and called the presidential crisis \\"a foreign-linked coup d'√©tat.\\" It also likened Juan Guaid√≥ to Egypt's president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who played a significant role in overthrowing the Turkey-backed Islamist regime of Mohamed Morsi in 2013 following mass protests against the latter's rule. When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, visited Egypt, Turkish newspapers G√ºne≈ü and Sabah accused the French president of possessing hypocritical stances on democracy for describing Maduro's re-election as \\"illegitimate\\" but then shaking hands with a leader (el-Sisi) \\"who massacres pro-democracy protesters\\" and \\"[holds] thousands of political prisoners in Egyptian jails.\\" In order to add credence to the claims of European hypocrisy on the matters of democratic support, columnist ƒ∞smail Ya≈üa compared Maduro's re-election to el-Sisi's election in 2014, saying that Maduro's 67% of the vote proved that he was \\"democratically elected,\\" and that since el-Sisi won his election with 97% of the vote despite a turnout perceived as low, election boycotts, and limited opposition, this proved in his words that it was a \\"sham.\\"  Recognition  upright=3|thumb|center|Nations recognizing presidential power  Guaid√≥ acting presidency   Foreign states  = Non-UN states = *  Intergovernmental organizations   International organizations   Domestic organizations   Support of National Assembly, led by Guaid√≥   Foreign states  = Non-UN states = *  Intergovernmental organizations   Maduro presidency   Foreign states  = Non-UN states =  Intergovernmental organizations   International organizations   Domestic organizations  *25px PDVSA  Armed groups   Vocal neutrality  Several nations called specifically for non-intervention and, without supporting either side, asked for diplomatic discussions to be held to move forward.  Foreign states   Intergovernmental organizations   Public opinion  Reuters has described previous polls in Venezuela as being \\"notoriously controversial and divergent\\". The Wall Street Journal described Datan√°lisis as \\"a respected pollster in Venezuela\\" in March 2019. Stratfor reported Maduro lost support of working-class Venezuelans as government handouts subsided; the opposition to Maduro has proposed plans to end the economic crisis, resulting in increased support for them. The Wall Street Journal reported that barrios are turning against Maduro in \\"a shift born of economic misery and police violence\\", adding that \\"many blame government brutality for the shift\\". Pollster Datan√°lisis found that, among the poorest 20% of Venezuelans, Maduro's support had fallen to 18% in February 2019 from 40% two years earlier. An April survey of 1,000 voters conducted by Hercon Consultores found that 78% of Venezuelans recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president. An 11‚Äì14 March 2019 survey of 1,100 people in 16 Venezuelan states and 32 cities by Megan√°lisis found that 89% of respondents want Maduro to leave the presidency. A Datan√°lisis poll on 4 March found Guaid√≥ approval at 61%, and Maduro's at all-time low of 14%. Guaid√≥ would win 77% in an election to Maduro's 23%. citing Francisco Monaldi Tweet of 2 March, \\"Maduro cae a su m√≠nimo hist√≥rico de aprobaci√≥n con 14%. Guaid√≥ logra 61% de aprobaci√≥n y arrasar√≠a en una elecci√≥n con 77% vs. 23% Maduro.\\" A 2019 Gallup poll in Colombia, published in March, showed 80% of Colombians have a favorable opinion of Guiad√≥, 97% have a negative opinion of Maduro, and 45% believe the United States military should intervene in Venezuela. President Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez of Venezuela's neighboring Colombia was among the early supporters of Guaid√≥; an earlier (7‚Äì11 February) Colombian survey of 1,008 individuals in more than 20 cities, with a margin of error of 3%, found that his popularity had surged 15 points, partly because of his position on Venezuela, and that 70% of Colombians had a favorable view of Guaid√≥, and 93% had a negative impression of Maduro. Surveys between 30 January and 1 February by Megan√°lisis recorded that 84.6% of respondents recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president, 11.2% were undecided and 4.1% believe that Maduro was president. The study of 1,030 Venezuelans was conducted in 16 states and 32 cities. Also at Chicago Tribune A telephone survey of 999 Venezuelans by Hercon from 25 to 30 January showed that 81.9% of respondents recognized Guaid√≥ as president, 13.4% said Maduro was president and 4.6% were undecided. A Megan√°lisis survey of 870 Venezuelans between 24 and 25 January reported that 83.7% of respondents recognized Guaid√≥ as the legitimate president, 11.4% could not decide who was president and 4.8% recognized Maduro as president. A pre-23 January 2019 poll by Hinterlaces, a pollster headed by Constituent National Assembly member and described as pro-Maduro, reported that 86% of Venezuelans would oppose a military intervention by the United States and 81% disagree with violent protests. Surveys of 900 people between 19 and 20 January by Megan√°lisis reported that 81.4% hoped that Guaid√≥ would be sworn in on 23 January while 84.2% supported a transitional government to replace Maduro's government. A telephone survey of 1,000 registered voters by Venezuelan pollster Hercon, conducted from 15 to 19 January 2019, reported 79.9% of respondents agreeing with Maduro leaving the presidency. Regarding the National Assembly, 68.8% of respondents rated their work as being positive while 15.6% rated their actions as negative. When asked if they agreed with the National Assembly swearing in Guaid√≥ as interim president, 68.6% agreed and 19.4% disagreed. According to Datan√°lisis, in early 2019, 63% of Venezuelans believed that a change of government was possible. Fourteen months later, in May 2020, after the Macuto Bay raid, the percentage decreased to 20%. Public support for Guaid√≥ decreased following the Macuto Bay raid in May 2020, with 88.3% of respondents to a Megan√°lisis poll saying that they believed that Guaid√≥ was not suited to govern Venezuela.

She was one of a handful of women working in the Hollywood recording studio business in a technical role during the 1970s, and was the first woman to receive an RIAA Platinum album for her engineering of AutoAmerican by Blondie.  Early years  Bent grew up in Los Angeles. At age 8, Bent and her brother were in the Screen Children's Guild and worked as an extra for tv and film. Her family was musical; singing and performing were part of her family life. She owned her first tape recorder before her 8th birthday. Bent studied piano and flute and made her first recording at 9 years old (with the Compton Youth Symphony Orchestra). Growing up, she was interested in seeing films and watching live music. Bent studied Film & TV and radio production at the University of Southern California (USC) and California State Long Beach. She then studied audio engineering at SoundMasters Recording Institute, which was one of the only recording schools at the time.  Music career  Bent worked as an assistant engineer at The Village Recorders studio in Los Angeles. She was hired in August 1976 and was one of four women on engineering staff. Her credits included Aja by Steely Dan; Breakfast in America by Supertramp; Tusk by Fleetwood Mac. She worked her way up to engineer (her first session in April 1977) and became chief engineer for Mike Chapman. She engineered AutoAmerican by Blondie and other of Chapman's artists such as The Knack and Suzi Quatro. Bent engineered at other major studios such as United Western, The Record Plant, and Air London. She is known for being the first woman to receive an RIAA Platinum album for engineering (for AutoAmerican by Blondie). Bent is also recognized for being one of a handful of women working in the Hollywood recording studio business (in a technical role) during the 1970s. For Aja, Bent studied Steely Dan's previous albums (including who played on them and engineered). She says that level of study paid off. One of her mentors was the engineer on that album, Roger Nichols. She learned from Donald Fagen to make things right versus making things perfect. Bent moved into post-production (for film and television) but continues to work on music. In 2016, she recorded an all analog album with the band The Barrelhouse Kings. 2018, she recorded Primal King's self-titled album at United Recordings using all analog equipment.

She first appeared in the series nineteen episode \\"We Need to Talk About Fredrik\\", broadcast on 12 December 2017. Nicky arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a trainee doctor (F1). Fifty five female actresses attended auditions to play Nicky and Meena Chowdhury. The series producer Kate Hall work-shopped the characters during August 2017 and in September it was announced that Owusu and Salma Haque had been chosen to play Nicky and Meena. Nicky is characterised as a conscientious, talented and clever doctor. She is from a struggling working- class background and has to prove herself at Holby City hospital. She progresses from F1 to F2 and decides to specialise in cardiothoracic surgery on the show's fictitious Darwin ward. Her time in the show sees her constantly competing with Meena and later F2 doctor Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman). She also struggles to impress her clinical lead and Consultant Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel). Other stories for the character include developing a partying lifestyle and getting into debt. Nicky's debts stories were revisted in 2020, after the show's producers decided to explore the character's backstory. Casting In August 2017, Holby City series producer Kate Hall told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she planned to introduce two new female doctors. Fifty-five \\"emerging young actresses\\" auditioned for the roles and six were chosen for the second stage of the casting process. She said that they were work shopping the characters and doing screen tests with Alex Walkinshaw and Kaye Wragg who play Adrian \\"Fletch\\" Fletcher and Essie Harrison respectively. Hall added that whoever had the best chemistry in the tests would be cast and they would both debut on-screen in the months that followed. On 29 September 2017, it was announced that Owusu had joined the show playing Nicky, a F1 trainee doctor. She was employed alongside Salma Haque who took the role of Nicky's best friend Meena Chowdhury. It was revealed that the two trainees would discover how working in a challenging role would affect their lifelong friendship. The actress was happy to secure the role of a doctor and enjoyed watching her initial scenes back. Owusu previously played Libby Fox in the soap opera EastEnders, which like Holby City is filmed at Elstree Studios. The actress compared working on Holby City to going back to school, because she was already familiar with the studios. Development Introduction Duncan Lindsay from Metro reported that Nicky and Meena would be introduced together. They are best friends and arrive from medical school and realise that working at Holby City hospital is more difficult than they imagined. He added that the pair would be monitored by Consultant cardiothoracic surgeon Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel), a character known for being \\"intimidating\\". Jac questions whether the new employees can cope with their new responsibilities. Nicky first appears in the series nineteen episode \\"We Need to Talk About Fredrik\\", broadcast on 12 December 2017. At the time of their introduction the hospital's staff are reeling following a mass shooting committed by staff member Fredrik Johansson (Billy Postlethwaite). They are rotad onto the acute admissions unit (AAU). Owusu explained that \\"she joins with Meena, so she has her best friend at her side - and as far as the aftermath of recent events go, neither of them know any different.\\" Nicky is from a struggling working-class background whereas Meena is more privileged. They initially work well together out of fear they will fail their rotation. As they progress they become competitive in a bid to impress the hospital hierarchy. Series producer Kate Hall told Lindsay that the duo are \\"friends from medical school and Nicky and Meena will have their work cut out as Holby‚Äôs fresh F1‚Äôs. Thrown into a fiercely rivalrous, fast-paced surgical world, they will need to go all out to impress senior-ranking consultants and as the young doctors fight to survive, their friendship will be sorely tested.\\" Characterisation A publicist from BBC Online describes the character as \\"conscientious, talented and clever\\" but she often fails to excel in her career. Nicky feels fine getting her job done to the required standard and \\"doesn't have a strong desire to be the best.\\" They add that she is not a boring character because she has a liking for partying. Nicky consumes too much alcohol after her shifts finish and she is often hungover on the job. Owusu told Tricia Welch from the Daily Express that she thinks Nicky is \\"smart and driven\\". Owusu told Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap that Nicky has a \\"really academic side\\" and has her \\"head screwed on\\". She is worldly and not naive, a young woman with \\"immense talent, drive and ambition.\\" Owusu felt lucky to play the character as a young female herself. The actress added that she is also \\"very bold, smart, and passionate about her work - and really throws herself into it.\\" The actress liked Nicky's style while at work because she is always seen in comfortable baggy scrubs. When she is not in the hospital Nicky is seen in dark T-shirts, black jeans and an array of colourful neck scarves. Her favourite item of Nicky's are her Marks & Spencer burgundy creeper shoes with a high platforms. Owusu said that she would not personally wear Nicky's off-duty attire but found it fun while on the set. Career Nicky faces on challenging case when she is assigned to patient Raymond Heron (Martin Behrman). He cannot eat food without vomiting and Nicky is left to diagnose his condition. Through the case she gains experience working with registrar Xavier Duval (Marcus Griffiths) and they struggle to find out what is wrong. When Raymond reveals that he lost ten stone in two years Nicky makes a diagnosis of SMA Syndrome, which caused the weight loss. When Nicky makes a correct diagnosis on a patient, Consultant neurosurgeon John Gaskell (Paul McGann) invites Nicky to assist him in surgery. Meena convinces Nicky to turn down the offer because they are still new. Meena betrays Nicky and sneaks off to assist Gaskell in the operating theatre instead. Nicky later decides to put her career before her friendship with Meena. When they are forced to work together on Darwin they compete to impress Jac which causes them to argue. Nicky finally showcases her ambition and betrays Meena by stealing her slot in surgery. Both Nicky and Meena pass their first year on the foundation programme and progress to F2. Consultant general surgeon Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) is not impressed by their new arrogance and decides to give them a group of new F1 doctors to mentor. He also sets them medical tasks to solve but they use modern technology to exceed his expectations. Nicky decides that she wants to specialise in Cardiothoracic surgery and has to prove herself by diagnosing a difficult case. Nicky has a difficult time working for Jac. Things change on Darwin when consultant Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) takes over while Jac recovers from surgery. She makes the ward more fun and gives more freedom to the staff. Akudolu assessed that \\"poor Nicky was terrified while working under Jac, so the pressure is lifted a little bit with Mo in charge.\\" The medic later jeopardises her career when she treats patient Dan Chambers (Elliot Balchin). Dan is an old school friend of Nicky's and the pair have sex the night before he is admitted to Darwin ward. Nicky realises that Dan has nearly beaten another patient to death the evening before. Dan reveals he took intimate photographs of their night together in the hope it scares her from informing the police. Her mentor Mo convinces Nicky to report him and she is left scared by Dan's behaviour. Sasha Morris of the Daily Star reported that viewers were concerned for her safety following her encounters with Dan. F2 doctor Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman) joins Darwin working rotations with Nicky and Jac coins a duo nickname for them: \\"Foetus and Fauntleroy\\". The pair compete against each other to win a prize of accompanying Jac to a medical conference in Naples. Nicky is angry when her patient Laurie Stocks (Brian Pettifer) dies because the Darwin team prioritise their colleague Tom Campbell-Gore's (Denis Lawson) surgery. Cameron was first to diagnose Laurie but admits he had help unlike Nicky and this prompts them to work as a team. Partying and debts Nicky develops a reputation for partying and drinking. When she is on a night out with Meena, they meet new registrar Xavier. Meena likes Xavier but Nicky ends up getting drunk with him. Griffiths told Inside Soap's Tyler that Nicky and Xavier share a \\"very fractious relationship\\". They go on an \\"alcohol fuelled journey\\" which lands Nicky handcuffed to a bed in the staff on-call room. In the morning a hungover Nicky cannot remember anything and questions what happened to her. Griffiths explained that Xavier enjoys winding people up and he refuses to disclose anything from the night before. He added that this sets the tone for their working relationship. On another occasion Nicky gets drunk and goes to work with an extreme hangover. She then receives a letter informing her about her mounting debts. They threaten to send bailiffs to her home if she does not hand over twelve thousand pounds. Xavier offers to help sort the debt when he notices her upset. In another episode Meena worries that her relationship with Xavier is failing and asks Nicky to speak to him. When Nicky finds Xavier in an office, she knocks over a container housing a virus and the pair are locked inside while decontamination process is completed. During this time Nicky decides to be truthful about her escalating problems. She reveals more debt and tells him that she has developed an alcohol problem. The show's series producer Jane Wallbank had promised more prominent stories for Nicky in 2020. She told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that \\"we will learn more about Nicky, the huge strains on her, and where that goes in a big, gritty, topical story close to my heart.\\" Nicky's financial woes were soon revisited when 2020 episodes aired. Writers introduced Nicky's mother Tracey McKendrick (Cathy Murphy) into the series for the story. Dainty revealed that Tracey would be Nicky's \\"troublesome mum\\" and it would offer the \\"first insight into the enormous personal straits\\" on Nicky. Her woes begin when her mother has a car crash and injures Steve Connor (John Wark). He blackmails Tracey and Nicky for money or he will report the crime to the police. He threatens Tracey, which forces Nicky to take on the debt. Writers also played Nicky \\"out of character\\" as she calls in sick to earn extra money working overtime in a separate hospital. Steve carries on blackmailing Nicky for money and Nicky jeopardises her career to earn money. When a patient offers her cash in exchange for surgery, Nicky endangers the patient's life for the bribe. Owusu told Tyler from Inside Soap that Nicky allowed the situation to worsen because \\"she has a knack of burying her head in the sand.\\" Nicky feels like there is no one to help her through her predicament. She added that \\"there's such a genuine threat from Steve, that Nicky doesn't really have anywhere to turn.\\" Cameron later discovers the truth and violently threatens Steve to leave Nicky alone. Owusu believed that Nicky wouldn't suspect Cameron did any wrong to Steve because \\"she's wearing love goggles\\" where he is concerned. Reception Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy expressed her love for the character of Nicky and was pleased to learn she would be involved in a more prominent stories. She later branded Nicky a \\"fun-loving medic\\". In regards to her money woes, David Hollingsworth from What's on TV things were \\"rapidly spiralling out of control for the cash-strapped medic.\\" Another writer from the publication branded Nicky a \\"feisty\\" character. Their colleague Victoria Wilson called her a \\"young and ambitious\\" doctor. Isobel Hine writing for the Daily Star branded Nicky and Steve's story a \\"twisted blackmail plot\\". They also bemoaned the dearth of realism in Nicky letting Steve blackmail her. Inside Soap's Tyler described a newly arrived Nicky as \\"full of beans\\" but noted her experiences at work are \\"no walk in the park\\". She also thought that Nicky's actions went \\"from bad to worse\\" during her debt storyline. Sue Haasler writing for Metro reviewed the episode featuring Nicky's encounters with Dan. She opined that \\"sometimes Nicky comes across as quite cocky and confident, but this episode showed she really isn't.\\" The critic was not impressed with Nicky and Meena's double act. She called it a \\"fairly immature\\" friendship and tired rivalry story that never seemed to develop into anything bigger. She said they constantly spent their screen time \\"sulking, sniping and competing with each other\\", an attitude Haasler believed was unhelpful to the patients. Haasler later praised Owusu's comedic performances, branding her \\"really funny\\" during her \\"hilariously impressed\\" behaviour towards consultant Kian Madani (Ramin Karimloo).

History  In April 1854, inspired by the Taiping Rebellion in central China, members of the Heaven and Earth Society in Guangdong province launched the Hongbing Uprising (Á∫¢ÂÖµËµ∑‰πâ) in Foshan. The rebellion was led by Chen Kai (Èô≥Èñã) and Li Wenmao (ÊùéÊñáËåÇ), who are both of Zhuang ethnicity. They captured several counties and besieged Guangzhou but the Qing army managed to recover most of the territory. The rebels retreated west to Guangxi and captured Xunzhou (modern-day Guiping) in 1855, renamed it to Xiujing (ÁßÄ‰∫¨), and made it their capital. The Dacheng Kingdom army was joined by the forces of other Zhuang rebels such as Huang Dingfeng (ÈªÉÈºéÈ≥≥), Li Wencai (ÊùéÊñáÂΩ©) and Li Jingui (ÊùéÈå¶Ë≤¥), all rebelled against the Qing since the 1850s. In November 1856, Li Wenmao besieged and captured Liuzhou. In April 1857, Chen Kai captured Wuzhou. They advanced to Yongzhou (now Nanning) and captured the city. In September 1857, the Dacheng Kingdom managed to expand half of Guangxi, an area equals to northern Vietnam. They issued their own currency called Pingjing Shengbao (Âπ≥ÈùñÂãùÂØ∂). In 1857, Li Wenmao attacked Guilin. However, the Qing army, commanded by Jiang Yili (ËíãÁõäÊæß) managed to recapture Wuzhou. During a battle in Huaiyuan, Li Wenmao was killed. Liuzhou then fell to the Qing. In 1859, Chen Kai led a large land and naval force in an attack on Wuzhou. The attack failed and Chen Kai had to retreat with heavy losses. In February 1861, the Qing army attacked Xiujing. The city fell after a six-month long siege. Chen Kai was killed in the battle. The rebellion then entered an insurgency phase, actively resisting the Qing army until the last rebel holdouts surrendered in May 1864.

He started his service on the ship Orage, which was sailing to Martinique and Papeete. He became some sort of reporter, writing a ship's newsletter and airing music and interviews on the ship's radio. He was serving a month's imprisonment at the Arue camp in Tahiti for provocative behavior and misbehaving with his mates. After just nine months in the navy, he was sent back to France. During this service, he befriended a lot of people, including Philippe Heurtault, who became his photographer in later years. When he returned to Paris, he attended the Panth√©on-Assas University for a few months and became a steward for Air France in 1972, but it was high society clubs that attracted him. According to Gilles Martin-Chauffier, for fifteen years, Jacques de Bascher \\"has evolved like a snake in the grass\\" between the gardens of the Tuileries, the five- stars, the Parisian backrooms, The Palace, the rue Sainte-Anne, (The Seven), The Blue Hand in Montreuil, the castle of his family and the big festivals of the fashion world.  Life with Lagerfeld  Jacques de Bascher first met Karl Lagerfeld at the Nuage at the age of twenty-one. A few months later, after Jacques de Bascher resigned from Air France, they went to live together until 1989. Lagerfeld claimed their relationship was platonic and non- physical. Lagerfeld told French journalist Marie Ottavi: Karl Lagerfeld appreciated Bascher's vast literary culture and impertinence, his aristocratic appearance and his manner of dressing. Kenzo Takada hired Jacques' brother Xavier de Bascher to be his general manager. They usually spend their time in gay nightclubs, like ‚ÄúLe 7‚Äù. In 1973, Yves Saint Laurent, at the time still companion of Pierre Berg√©, fell in love with Jacques de Bascher. While Lagerfeld pretended he didn't notice, Yves Saint Laurent and Jacques de Bascher had an unbalanced and destructive relationship. Berg√© threatened Bascher, who put an end to this affair. During these years, Jacques de Bascher, who did not work and was maintained by Karl Lagerfeld fell into risky sexual practices, and eventually drugs and alcohol put him into a paranoid state. Sex was a huge part of de Bascher's life. He had relationships with both men and women. He was known for organizing orgies and an infamous BDSM party, named ‚ÄúBlack Moratorium‚Äù, which was funded by Lagerfeld.  Last years and death  Jacques de Bascher discovered that he was HIV positive in 1984. At the end of his life, he cut himself off almost from everyone, unable to bear the physical decline. He died of AIDS at Raymond Poincar√© University Hospital in 1989, watched over by Karl Lagerfeld, who had an extra bed installed at his bedside. The following year Karl Lagerfeld bought a house near Hamburg, which he named Villa Jako in Jacques de Bascher's memory. In 1998, Lagerfeld launched a fragrance called Jako. The intimate, family-only funeral mass took place in the chapel of the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery; a second mass was celebrated in the chapel of M√©e-sur-Seine, where Karl Lagerfeld owned property, in the presence of Jacques de Bascher's mother and friends, including his former fianc√©e, Princess Diane de Beauvau-Craon.

These crises occur in West Africa, primarily in Nigeria, but also in Mali, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic. Violence between these groups is carried out by individuals rather than groups. The death count for each attack is small, although the large number of these attacks left a death toll in the thousands.  History   Conflict between farmers and herders  The Fulani are largely nomadic/semi-nomadic and live in the semi-arid climate of West Africa. Due to population growth and desertification, Fulani nomads have to move south towards more fertile lands to graze their herds. This created conflicts with the farmers. This resulting violence left a death toll of over 10,000. This violence is always interpreted in Nigeria through cultural and religious lenses. The Fulani herdsmen are seen by those who don't know them as almost exclusively Muslims, while the farmers in Middle belt are almost all Christians. However the true picture is the herdsmen only care about their animals as the conflict occur even between them and the Hausa farmers. Both sides suffer in what either party terms as ethnic cleansin  Attacks   Nigeria  Nigeria experienced the most attacks. In 2018, approximately 1,930 Christians died from Fulani attacks there. These attacks are typically carried out with firearms, although bombs and kidnapping are also used. They mostly target private property followed by government buildings, businesses and religious institutions.  Mali  Fulani extremism has had much influence in Mali. In 2012, the Malian government was overthrown by Amadou Sanogo. Although tension between the Christian south and the Muslim north was already present, the coup weakened the country and allowed terrorism to rise. Several Fulani extremist groups have risen in Mali. The Macina Liberation Front (FLM) formed in 2015, and committed 29 attacks with at least 129 casualties. Another group is the National Alliance for the Protection of Fulani Identity and the Restoration of Justice (ANSIPRJ). This group carried out one attack in 2016 that killed 17 and injured 35. Malian Fulani extremist groups target state facilities rather than private property. A majority of the attacks are done with firearms. Efforts to reduce this conflict were aided by France, Mali's former colonizer, which sent military aid and assistance. The aid was largely to counter the rise in terror. The United States supported France in this effort. The United Nations sent peacekeeping troops to Mali. However, the peacekeeping troops became a target.  Central African Republic  As of April 2019, fourteen attacks had occurred in the Central African Republic. The main target was private property. The weapon of choice is a firearm.  Democratic Republic of Congo  As of April 2019, one attack had occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo. On March 26, 2016, Fulani extremists attacked a military base in Ngaliema. The attackers injured a soldier but cost them three of their own men.  Cameroon  In February 2020, Fulani extremists carried out the Ngarbuh massacre alongside Cameroonian soldiers.Cameroon: Civilians Massacred in Separatist Area, Human Rights Watch, Feb 25, 2020.

In 1947, he participated in the February 28 rebellion against Kuomintang rule in Taiwan, and was imprisoned on Green Island for several years before escaping to mainland China from Kinmen in 1956. In China he worked as an engineer, and served as Chairman of Fujian Provincial Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and Vice Chairman of the Fujian Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).  Early life and education  Ye was born on 8 December 1927 into a wealthy family of doctors in Pingtung County, Japanese Taiwan. He received a Japanese education and could barely speak Hokkien. An outstanding student, he was admitted to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1942, at the age of 15. After the surrender of Japan in 1945 at the end of World War II, the Kuomintang government of the Republic of China took over Taiwan, and Ye returned there after finishing his studies in 1946.  February 28 incident, arrest, and escape  In early 1947, Ye was accepted by the graduate school of Columbia University. Before he set out for the United States, however, the February 28 incident broke out and the Kuomintang violently suppressed anti- government protesters. Ye joined the ensuing rebellion and returned from Taipei to Pingtung, where he organized an \\"anti-violence group\\" and raided the local arsenal for weapons. When the Kuomintang army arrived in Pingtung, he fled to the mountains in Taitung. Ye was arrested in 1951 after four years of hiding. He was incarcerated in the penal colony of Green Island for several years, and was then transferred to Kinmen Island to perform penal labour as a ship repairman. Kinmen, though controlled by Taiwan, was just off the coast of Fujian in mainland China. In March 1956, Ye decided to make a daring escape to China. He took a sampan in the middle of a night, paddled across the sea, and arrived in Zhangpu, Fujian.  Career in China  In mainland China, Ye learned to speak Mandarin. He worked as an engineer in the Department of Industry of the Fujian Provincial Government, and later in the Department of Fishing. In July 1961, he became an engineer and associate research professor at the Fisheries Research Institute of Fujian. He mainly worked on developing industrial fishing equipment and technology, and was awarded provincial science and technology prizes four times. Ye was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and was politically rehabilitated afterwards. After joining the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (Taimeng) in 1981, he served as Chairman of Taimeng's Xiamen Municipal Committee from 1985 to 1988, and of the Fujian Provincial Committee from 1985 to 1997. He was also a member of the Central Standing Committee of Taimeng from 1983 to 1993, and Vice Chairman of the Fujian Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) from 1996 to 1998. He retired in February 1999. In a 2014 interview with Chinese media, Ye reflected that had the February 28 incident not happened, he would have probably lived an unremarkable life in the United States and retired to his hometown. Instead, he was never able to visit Pingtung again after the incident. Ye died on 6 February 2019 in Xiamen, at the age of 91.

V. Guhan in his Tollywood directorial debut. The film features Kalyan Ram, Shalini Pandey and Nivetha Thomas in the lead roles. The music for the film is composed by Shekar Chandra, and the film is produced by Mahesh S. Koneru under the production company East Coast Production. The film follows an investigative journalist who finds himself threatened after he tries to decode a recurring nightmare involving a woman's death. The film released on 1 March 2019. It received generally positive reviews from critics and became a commercial success. Plot While sleeping in room number 118 of the Paradise resort, Gowtham dreams about a girl getting beaten and a car being thrown into lake. The next day, he is revealed to be an investigative journalist who stops a money laundering operation by fighting off the home minister's brother and his goons while filming everything. The minister is exposed, and Gowtham is invited to a night party at the same resort where he sleeps in room 118 again. When the dream recurs, he visits a psychiatrist named Dr. Athmaram Divakar, who advises him not to take the dream seriously. Soon, a car chase with the home minister's henchmen takes Gowtham to a road he saw in his dreams. Jumping into the nearby lake, he discovers an empty car belonging to a church. The Church Father, Francis, tells Gowtham it was driven by a woman named Esther. A strange gate symbol leads Gowtham to a shut-down printing press where he discovers missing posters of the girl in his dreams, Aadhya. He later realizes that Aadhya went missing and his dream appeared on full moon days. Believing the visitors during the other six full moon days to have had the same dream, he sets out to contact them but is contacted by Aadhya, who tells him not to look for her. He uses police help to trace the phone number and chases a van containing the phone but finds it belonging to none. Some hints from the visitors lead him to a photo of Aadhya and a girl from Venkataramana Public School whose employee named Murthy is murdered while on his way to help Gowtham. Gowtham visits the office of Sai Videos office, who filmed an event at the resort, and in the footage sees Aadhya with a man who is soon kidnapped by some goons and a chase ensues, resulting in his death. Gowtham then goes to meet Francis and identifies a nun as the woman who contacted him as Aadhya. She then reveals that Francis told her to make the call and even lied about Esther to Gowtham. He then heads for Vizag to meet Francis, following which the nun is killed. Esther is revealed to be the daughter of Francis, who is then shot by the goons. A fight ensues, resulting in Gowtham escaping with Esther, who then tells him that Aadhya was a friendly computer science teacher who showed affection on Prabhavathi, a young student who died after a vaccination in the school. Aadhya tried to investigate and came to know about illegal vaccinations run by Alanta company. Aadhya and Esther went to the Paradise resort to meet a friend for help, but had to part ways because of a phone call that told Esther that her friend met with an accident. Upon finding Aadhya missing and goons looking for her, Esther had to run away. Gowtham visits Athmaram ,who claims to make humans enter the world of dreams and decides to use his technology after a successful trial. Gowtham, his fianc√©e Megha, and assistant Ramesh are on their way to the resort but get attacked by the same goons and a car chase ensues, resulting in a fight that leaves Gowtham injured. Asking both Megha and Ramesh to not enter until he voluntarily comes out, he injects himself with the drug given by Athmaram and sleeps. He enters the dream within his mind and realizes that he was the one supposed to help Aadhya but could not as he too had to leave upon learning about the accident of his and Esther's common friend Siddharth. He then watches Aadhya being taken to room 118 where she meets the CEO and owner of Alanta Company V. N. Shah. His henchmen have all the evidence snatched from her and destroyed. She is brutally killed and buried near a fountain in the same resort. Gowtham upon waking up gets the spot where she is buried excavated with the help of police team and obtains a bracelet from her skeletal remains, which has a USB drive containing Aadhya's final video message along with the evidence that she had collected thus far against the company (thus, the evidence destroyed by Shah's henchmen was only a copy that she had brought to show Gowtham whom she was to meet that evening during the event at resort). The culprits are captured, Gowtham is praised by the media, and Shah shoots himself. Later at his house that night Gowtham has a bright dream in which Aadhya appears with a smile, indicating that her soul is now at peace. He wakes up to find her presence of vision disappeared.

Following his early ornithological research, according to Wired magazine, \\"After listening to the airport executives‚Äô bird-related angst, Dolbeer decided the time had come for him to shift professional gears: He would henceforth devote himself to preventing midair collisions between birds and planes.\\"https://www.wired.com/story/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-the-midair- collisions-menacing-air-travel/ From 1972 to 2008 Dolbeer worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Research Center in Sandusky, Ohio. He co- authored the very first course of action for wildlife management at airports with Edward Cleary, entitled Wildlife Hazard Management at Airports: A Manual for Airport Personnel, which is used at airports through North America, Europe, Africa, and South America. He also helped to found the Aviation- Wildlife Research Project of the Department of Agriculture during the 1980s and led it until 2002. Between 1997 and 2008 he chaired the Bird Strike Committee-USA, a committee coordinating industry and government efforts to reduce collisions between aircraft and birds. While at the Department, he was also the National Coordinator for the Airport Wildlife Hazards Program from 2002 to 2008. In all his committees, Dolbeer worked with both domestic and foreign government officials to create international techniques for the prevention of bird strikes and the promotion of safety for birds and aircraft. Over his time at the Department of Agriculture, he authored about 170 scientific papers and was an associate editor for the Journal of Wildlife Management. As of 2017, he had published more than two hundred. He is also an elected member of the American Ornithological Society. In terms of recognition, he is a two-time winner of the Jack H. Berryman Institute Research Award, three-time awardee of the USDA Honor Award, and was given both the Lifetime Achievement Award from Bird Strike Committee U.S.A. and the FAA Excellence in Aviation Research award. He was then the inaugural winner of the Caesar Kleberg Award for Excellence in Applied Wildlife Research from The Wildlife Society in 2008.  Consultancy  Following his position with the Department of Agriculture, Dolbeer became a consultant in the area, including serving as an advisor to the FAA alongside the USDA. In 2015 he composed the report Trends in Reporting of Wildlife Strikes for the FAA, which analyzed how many collisions between aircraft and birds in the US. In the report he stated that mandatory reporting of collisions would not be necessary due to the number of voluntary reports issues per year, stating that 42% of bird strikes per year were likely reported. Dolbeer currently serves as a consultant for the FAA national wildlife strike database, a database he helped establish in the 1990s. Through his work, Dolbeer led research projects that developed several methods of deterring birds from being in the landing and take-off paths of airplanes airports and dispersing those that approach the area. This has included laser-driven bird dispersal, and working with the EPA and FDA to approve foraging repellents and wildlife capture drugs. Dolbeer's techniques led to a ‚Äúdramatic reduction‚Äù in collisions between birds and aircraft at the John F. Kennedy International Airport as well as several others. He also co- authored reports on the increase of bird strikes in US airspace, which he attributed to several factors, including the advent of quieter aircraft, as well as increases in populations of large-bird species near airports.  Personal life  Dolbeer was an elected official with the Board of Education in Huron, Ohio from 1981‚Äì1989. In addition to his consultancy work, he also manages a 56-acre wildlife sanctuary, Bluebird Haven, near his home. He was married to his wife Saundra for fifty years, until her death in 2017.

It mainly comprises the former site of Stapenhill House, which was donated to the town in 1933, woodland, lawn, wild flower meadows and formal planted areas along a stretch of the River Trent. A public space, it includes a large cement-rendered sculpture of a swan that has been described as a \\"Burton landmark\\".  Stapenhill House and park  Formal planting at Stapenhill Gardens; Stapenhill House was sited behind the trees in the background. The park has been remodelled from that of demolished manor house Stapenhill House which had a drive leading into Main Street. The house was H-shaped in plan and built primarily of brick with stone around windows (stone-dressing). In 1662 the parish recorded its nine hearths under the new system of hearth tax. The house came into the ownership of the Goodger family. Mary Goodger became the first female councillor of the borough in 1923, aged 84, and her son's wife its first female mayor in 1931. Her son Henry, a solicitor who inherited the practice of H. Goodger & Son, donated the estate to the town in 1933, in her memory. The 11.7-hectare gift enabled the joining up of an unbroken stretch of 1250 m of publicly owned parkland on the River Trent's north bank. For a time in the 1920s and 1930s a portion of the park, now known as The Dingle, was the Stapenhill Zoological Pleasure Gardens which had a bear pit and two crocodiles. This area now has a car park and children's play area.  In public ownership  The County Borough of Burton upon Trent demolished Stapenhill House and laid out gardens on the site. Much of the original layout was retained. Two bandstands (one has since been demolished) and a children's play area were later added. A sundial in the gardens marks the spot of the original house. Some of the site was lost in 1985 to allow construction of St Peter's Bridge which is on viaduct and decorated with flower containers. The site is mostly woodland, lawns, wild meadows and formal flower beds with trees and shrubberies. Its arboretum is near St Peter's Church and riverside steps lead to a swan feeding area. The park has three parts: Stapenhill Gardens, Stapenhill Hollows and the Woodland Walk. Car parking is provided at Main Street, Ferry Street and Stapenhill Hollows. The gardens are used by residents for passing on foot, picnicking and feeding the swans. The Diversitree sculpture was installed in 2016, replacing a diameter sloped flower bed near St Peter's Bridge. The sculpture emulates a tree in metal and is intended to illustrate local communities and reflect being part of the National Forest (England). Diversitree was the winning entry of 30 artists' designs and cost ¬£15,000. A Peace and Unity Garden was opened in the park in July 2018. It celebrates the diversity of Burton and commemorates the centenary of the end of World War I. Abandoned proposals In 2018 public toilets were threatened with closure, in cost-cutting by East Staffordshire after reduced central government funding. The plan prompted a campaign and petition which convinced a council meeting to abandon it. Swan The Stapenhill Gardens swan The park is notable for containing a large concrete sculpture of a swan, which has been described as a \\"Burton landmark\\". The sculpture, which also functions as a planter, was constructed by the borough council in 1953. Which of four competing symbolisms applies is unknown: It may be linked to the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II which took place that year - the monarch co-owns all mute swans since medieval times. It may recite folklore surrounding St Modwen, who founded Burton Abbey, being said to have first brought mute swans to the area. It may honour of the rare sighting of whooper and Bewick's swans on the Trent locally in April 1951 including that a Bewick swan (straight-necked as is the sculpture) nested in the grounds of St Peter's Church. It may represent a mute swan which was rescued with the help of a council gardener after having been found covered in oil in a town boatyard in the early 1950s; the swan, which died a few years later, is said to have been buried beneath or elsewhere in the park. The Burton park superintendent at the time was keen to employ his staff, somewhat unusually at the time, through the winter season so commissioned from them the sculpture's building. Its wings and base are reclaimed bricks, partly bound in chicken wire, then rendered with mortar. The neck was formed around a rebar support, obtained from the council's road department, and the eyes were made from glass marbles purchased at the town's outlet of Woolworths. The superintendent was not pleased with the modernist work, which he described to the treasurer as a \\"monstrosity\\", but it was liked by local people ensuring its survival. The swan was restored in summer 2018: damaged parts were replaced and new coats of render and paint were applied--prompted by complaints by Burton Civic Society in October 2017 and seeing expenditure of ¬£3,000, a tiny proportion of the council's budget.

It includes a number of plants that can be highly invasive, such as Japanese knotweed, Reynoutria japonica, and its hybrid with R. sachalinensis, R. √ó bohemica. Boundaries between the genera placed in the subfamily and their relationships have long been problematic, but a series of molecular phylogenetic studies have clarified some of them, resulting in the division of the subfamily into seven tribes. Taxonomy Phylogeny A 2015 molecular phylogenetic study suggested that the genera and tribes in Polygonoideae were related as shown in the following cladogram. Rumex included Emex, and Fallopia was not monophyletic, with some species placed outside the main group in the tribe Polygoneae, and some others grouping with Pteroxygonum, placed in the tribe Pteroxygoneae. Genera Some of the boundaries between the genera are not settled ; in particular, Fallopia is at least paraphyletic. A 2011 classification divided the subfamily into five tribes, Calligoneae, Fagopyreae, Persicariae, Polygoneae and Rumiceae, leaving some genera unplaced. A 2015 molecular phylogenetic study added two new tribes accommodating these genera, Oxygoneae and Pteroxygoneae.

Background  Studies show that a vast majority of people in the area commute via personal automobile, with 76.9% driving alone and 9.5% carpooling, aided by carpool lanes which expedite their commute. A further 7.03% of workers in the region work from home, so the transportation modes of the remaining roughly 6.5% are rounded out by public transit, cycling, walking, motorcycle riding, and other means.  Roads and highways  Major freeways   Interstate 80 (I-80)  Interstate 80 (I-80) is the east‚Äìwest Interstate Highway that runs through the Sacramento metropolitan area. The Yolo Causeway of I-80 as seen from the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area To the west, I-80 provides service to Fairfield, Oakland, and San Francisco (where it terminates). To the east, it provides service to Reno, Salt Lake City and beyond, terminating on the East Coast in Teaneck, New Jersey. alt= Within the Sacramento region, I-80 follows more of a northeast- southwest direction than a true east‚Äìwest direction, owing to both the local topography and the orientation of the nearby destination cities (Reno and San Francisco). left It enters the region on the west from the Bay Area in Yolo County along the south side of UC Davis and after passing through the city of Davis, it crosses the Yolo Bypass (a major flood bypass for Sacramento) on the Yolo Causeway. Soon after touching down in West Sacramento, it splits northward away from the western terminus of the concurrent Highway 50 and Business Loop 80, thus bypassing Downtown Sacramento which the 50/Business 80 concurrency serves. After the split, I-80 passes through the western side of West Sacramento, then continues on to cross over the American River, and passes through the middle of Natomas, where it has a full interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5). It then moves along the northern suburbs of Sacramento, North Sacramento and Del Paso Heights, before being joined by Business 80 at its eastern terminus in the southern part of North Highlands near the Sacramento McClellan Airport. The route continues on towards Citrus Heights, Roseville (where it leaves Sacramento County and enters Placer County), and Rocklin, where it has an interchange with the southern end of California State Route 65 (SR 65). At this point, I-80 virtually exits the farthest suburban sprawl of Sacramento along the route, and rises in elevation as it passes through smaller mountainous and rural communities of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  Interstate 5 (I-5)  Interstate 5 (I-5) is the north‚Äìsouth interstate highway that runs through the Sacramento metropolitan area. To the south, I-5 provides service to Stockton, Los Angeles, and San Diego, terminating at the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. To the north, it provides service to Redding, Portland, and Seattle, terminating at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. I-5 in Downtown Sacramento at the far left, with the I Street on-ramp to its right, looking up from a surface street The highway enters Sacramento County from the south near Thornton, then continues northward through the western edge of Elk Grove that is mostly uninhabited wetlands with the exception of Laguna West. As I-5 approaches the city limits of Sacramento near Freeport, it runs adjacent to the Sacramento River that is on the west. The river then makes an abrupt westward curve after which the highway is flanked by the south Sacramento neighborhoods of Pocket-Greenhaven on the west and Meadowview on the east. The river curves back and meets with I-5 again, closing up the Pocket area. The highway then continues along the west side of Land Park, passing by William Land Park and the Sacramento Zoo. As it reaches the southwest corner of the downtown grid, the highway has a full-service junction with the 50/Business 80 freeway, and also merges with California State Route 99 for a concurrency. An left I-5 then goes along the western edge of Downtown Sacramento, passing by many prominent city landmarks such as the Crocker Art Museum, Tower Bridge, and Old Sacramento. After exiting Downtown, I-5 travels through the west side of the Railyards, and then crosses the American River. As it goes through Natomas, it crosses I-80 at the junction between the two freeways. Roughly three miles north, I-5 abruptly curves westward as California State Route 99 splits off and continues northward towards Yuba City and Marysville, ending the concurrency. The county line between Sacramento and Yolo Counties marked by a sign on the I-5 bridge crossing the Sacramento River Following the split, the highway provides service to Sacramento International Airport (SMF), and as such, I-5 is the main route to access the airport for the entire Sacramento region. The highway then crosses the Sacramento River and routes across the Yolo Bypass via the Elkhorn Causeway. I-5 reaches Woodland, curves to the northwest direction, and then has a partial-service interchange with California State Route 113 at its northern terminus. After passing through Woodland, the highway converges with Interstate 505 near Dunnigan, then exits Yolo County, heading towards Redding and the Pacific Northwest.  U.S. Route 50 (US 50)  U.S. Route 50 (US 50) is an east‚Äìwest U.S. Highway through the Sacramento area that has its western terminus in West Sacramento, and provides service to South Lake Tahoe and ultimately Ocean City, Maryland, the highway‚Äôs eastern terminus. A road sign at the western terminus of US 50 in West Sacramento showing the distances of various cities (Ocean City, Maryland serves as the highway‚Äôs eastern end) US 50 begins by branching off in West Sacramento from I-80, thus creating its western terminus. This portion of the highway is also concurrent with Interstate 80 Business, so they also share the western terminus. In the eastern part of West Sacramento, a short spur route peels away from US 50 in the form of California State Route 275 (SR 275), providing direct access to the Tower Bridge and Capitol Mall in Sacramento. After US 50 crosses over the Sacramento River, it meets Interstate 5 (I-5) at a full junction at the southwestern corner of Downtown Sacramento. The alt= Following the I-5 junction, US 50 runs on a freeway section commonly referred to as the WX Freeway due to it being flanked by the parallel one-way W & X Streets, along the south side of Downtown Sacramento. This part of the freeway is also built upon a raised embankment, to allow the many city streets to pass under it. The route then hits an interchange with a crossing freeway where Business 80 is the route heading north, and SR 99 is the route heading south. Following that interchange, US 50 goes between East Sacramento on the north and Oak Park in the south, providing convenient access to the UC Davis Medical Center in the northern part of Oak Park. It then routes along the southern tip of the California State University, Sacramento (CSUS or Sac State) campus with special ramps to get drivers directly between the campus and the freeway. It continues to eastern Sacramento suburbs including La Riviera, Rosemont, Rancho Cordova, and Folsom. This section of the highway east of Sac State is known to be a busy office corridor heavily concentrated with office parks, thus also causing traffic jams in both directions during rush hour. The flagship public university of the region, California State University, Sacramento (CSUS) is adjacent to US 50 near East Sacramento As the highway exits Folsom, it also exits the farthest urban sprawl in that direction, climbs in elevation, and enters the more rural El Dorado County. It makes its way through many small municipalities, including Placerville and Pollock Pines and then reaches South Lake Tahoe.  California State Route 99 (SR 99)  California State Route 99 (SR 99) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway in the Sacramento area. To the south, it serves the Central Valley cities of Stockton, Modesto, Fresno, and Bakersfield before terminating at the Wheeler Ridge Interchange to join I-5. To the north, SR 99 provides service to Yuba City and Chico, terminating in Red Bluff. Galt at the right side of the picture|alt= SR 99 reaches the Sacramento region from the south at Galt, a small town that is a distant exurb of Sacramento. It then routes along the west side of the rural farming communities Herald and Wilton before going through the core of Sacramento‚Äôs suburban city on the south, Elk Grove. As it leaves Elk Grove, it passes by Cosumnes River College and a medical complex consisting of three major hospitals: Methodist Hospital of Sacramento, Sierra Vista Hospital, and the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento Medical Center. The college and medical complex are both immediately to the west of SR 99; there are exits to Bruceville Rd. designed to give emergency vehicles easy and quick access to the hospitals. The highway then goes through the heart of South Sacramento, providing access to local points of importance such as the Florin Towne Centre and Little Saigon (Sacramento). North of South Sacramento, SR 99 is flanked by Curtis Park on the west and Oak Park on the east; Sacramento City College is accessible as it is roughly a half mile west of the freeway at this point, and the McGeorge School of Law in Oak Park is right next to the freeway as well. SR 99 in South Sacramento, as seen through the fence of a pedestrian overpass At the junction with US 50 in the southeastern part of the central city, the thru lanes turn into the eastern section of Business 80. SR 99 does not continue straight, and instead connects to US 50 in the stretch west of the junction also known as the WX Freeway, in an unsigned concurrency (along with Business 80). At the interchange with I-5, SR 99 again does not pull through, and instead routes north onto the perpendicular I-5 for another unsigned concurrency. Sacramento City College is easily accessible from SR 99 south of Downtown SR 99 splits off from I-5 in North Natomas, with a slight northward jog, while I-5 makes a much sharper curve westward towards Sacramento International Airport and Woodland. SR 99 soon leaves Sacramento County, headed for Yuba City and Chico.  Business Loop 80 (Bus. 80)  Business Loop 80 (Bus. 80), (also known as Business Route 80, Business 80, Capital City Freeway, \\"Cap City Freeway\\", and \\"Biz 80\\"), is a business loop of Interstate 80 (I-80) in Sacramento. Route map of Business 80 in Sacramento shown in red It has two segments, western and eastern. The western segment runs concurrently with US 50 from its western terminus in West Sacramento all the way to the US 50/SR 99/Bus. 80 interchange at the southeastern corner of the central city.Sutter's Fort in Midtown Sacramento is accessible via the eastern segment of Bus. 80 At the interchange, the western segment of Bus. 80 does not pull through, and instead becomes the eastern segment that branches north from the junction (via connector ramps). The eastern segment (albeit more in a north‚Äìsouth orientation) is flanked by a pair of one-way streets, 29th St. and 30th St., dividing Midtown Sacramento on the west and East Sacramento on the east. The Sutter medical complex in Midtown, consisting of Sutter Medical Center and Sutter General Hospital, is immediately to the west of the freeway, as is Sutter's Fort, a historic park. Bus. 80 then crosses over the American River into the Arden-Arcade area, providing access to Arden Fair Mall (a popular shopping mall) and Cal Expo (site of the annual California State Fair and other big local events throughout the year). Around this point, the freeway also converges with California State Route 160 (SR 160), a highway that provides direct travel to Downtown Sacramento from the Arden-Arcade area. After passing through Arden-Arcade, the freeway rejoins I-80, thus terminating.  Other highways   California State Route 113 (SR 113)  California State Route 113 (SR 113) is a state highway that is primarily used as a north‚Äìsouth multi-lane freeway that carries traffic directly between I-80 near UC Davis and I-5 in Woodland. From the south, SR 113 originates as a two-lane highway near Rio Vista, then travels through Dixon, after which it co-signs the portion of I-80 between Dixon and the connector ramp to its own freeway alignment near UC Davis. The freeway portion routes all the way to Woodland, where it briefly overlaps with I-5, then exiting and heading towards Knights Landing as a two-lane highway again.  California State Route 65 (SR 65)  California State Route 65 (SR 65) is a state highway that runs between Roseville and Olivehurst. Its southern terminus is at the junction with I-80 in the northeast part of Roseville. It begins as a freeway to Lincoln. After reaching Lincoln it becomes an expressway. It then passes Sheridan and Wheatland before terminating in Olivehurst, where it converges with California State Route 70 to continue on to Marysville.  California State Route 16 (SR 16)  California State Route 16 (SR 16) is an east‚Äìwest state highway that travels from SR 20 near Wilbur Springs to SR 49 between Plymouth and Drytown. It enters the Sacramento metropolitan area at the west end through Yolo County. It takes a southeastward path through the small communities of Rumsey, Guinda, and Brooks. The route then turns eastward and passes through Esparto, California before crossing I-505. As it approaches Woodland, SR 16 turns 90 degrees to a northward direction at an intersection on the western edge of town. It hen converges with I-5 towards Sacramento on an unsigned concurrency. Combined with I-5, SR 16 travels past the Sacramento International Airport, across I-80, and through Downtown Sacramento along the Sacramento River before turning onto US 50 towards South Lake Tahoe at the junction. Rancho Murieta; shown is the sign at the south entrance to the town The route pulls through the interchange with SR 99/Bus. 80, then exits US 50 at Howe Ave. just east of Sacramento State University. SR 16 is carried on the Howe Ave section that is south of US 50 for a very short distance before turning eastward onto Folsom Blvd. Less than a mile later, the route branches off from Folsom Blvd. on the south side as Jackson Rd., and it is also the beginning of the signed portion east of the concurrency. It continues for many miles through unincorporated communities in Sacramento County, including Sloughhouse and Rancho Murieta before exiting the county (and the metropolitan area) into Amador County, headed for Plymouth, Drytown, and Jackson. The signed portion of the route is generally a two-lane highway in its entirety.  California State Route 84 (SR 84)  California State Route 84 (SR 84) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway that runs between Rio Vista in Solano County and the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta, and West Sacramento in Yolo County. The exit from I-80 shown here is the northern terminus of SR 84, also referred to as Reed Ave in that area. It enters the Sacramento region on the south side through Yolo County near Courtland. The route turns eastward for a short distance, then turns north where it becomes Jefferson Blvd. SR 84 retains that name through West Sacramento, where it crosses and interchanges with US 50. Shortly afterwards, the route changes roads and turns westward at a 4-way intersection, becoming Sacramento Ave. and then Reed Ave. before terminating at its junction with I-80.  California State Route 160 (SR 160)  California State Route 160 (SR 160) is a north‚Äìsouth state highway that runs between Antioch in the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta, and Arden-Arcade (a northeastern suburb of Sacramento). The route begins at its southern terminus in eastern Antioch, where it is formed by a junction with California State Route 4. It then crosses the Antioch Bridge, leaving Antioch and entering the tip of Sacramento County‚Äôs southwestern panhandle in Sherman Island. The route winds its way along the Sacramento River and through the delta, passing through small river towns such as Isleton, Walnut Grove, Courtland, and Clarksburg. Looking south on SR 160 from Sherman Island. Mount Diablo and the Antioch Bridge are visible in the distance. As SR 160 reaches the southern part of Sacramento near Cosumnes River Blvd., it continues straight, deviating from the Sacramento River that curves westward. At this point, the route is now referred to as Freeport Blvd. and it also becomes a four-lane expressway. It passes through the Meadowview neighborhood and then forms the western boundary of the Sacramento Executive Airport as it goes through South Land Park. As it proceeds through the central part of Land Park, it divides Sacramento City College on the east and William Land Park on the west. Right before reaching the railroad tracks near 4th Avenue/Wayne Hultgren station, SR 160 turns northwest at its fork with 21st St., still continuing as Freeport Blvd. The route joins Broadway and heads westward, then turning north onto the 15th St./16th St. one-way pair into the downtown grid; 15th St. is southbound and 16th St. is northbound. In the northern part of downtown, 15th St. actually dead ends, so the southbound part of the highway turns away from 15th St. at H St, a one-way eastbound street, for three city blocks, and north of H St. the southbound portion of the highway is carried on 12th St. 12th St. curves in the northern part of Downtown to be next to 16th St. and becomes a freeway. Then the highway turns northeastward, crosses the American River, and then turns eastward. The route terminates where it converges with Bus. 80 in Arden-Arcade.  Spur routes   California State Route 275 (SR 275)  California State Route 275 (SR 275) is a short spur route that peels off from US 50 in West Sacramento and provides direct access to Downtown Sacramento. After exiting US 50, the route runs along the north side of Raley Field, crosses the Tower Bridge, becomes Capitol Mall after touching down in Sacramento, and terminates at the front yard of the California State Capitol at 10th Street.

Cycling  In Sacramento, cycling is a common means of transportation, especially in the central city (Downtown and Midtown), where residents and visitors find it to be safe, cheap, and efficient. Many of the city streets in the urban core have 3 ft. wide designated bike lanes, some are painted bright green, and some are placed between the sidewalk and the parked cars (providing a physical barrier from moving motor vehicle traffic). There are also a variety of bike trails and bike paths in Sacramento, most notably the Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail that runs along the American River, a 32-mile trail closed to motor vehicles. The Jedediah Smith Memorial Trail, also known as the American River Parkway or the American River Bike Trail In Davis, a college town for UC Davis, cycling is incredibly popular. Here, some 23.2% of commuters commute by bicycle, the highest in the nation. This is more than the double the city with the next-highest percentage of bicycle commuters (Berkeley, California, another college town, with 9.7%). Jump Bikes offers its bicycle-sharing service in both Sacramento and Davis.

The new school board assumed control of Monseigneur-de-Charbonnel, which remained Toronto's only French first language separate secondary school until 2012, when the school board opened √âcole secondaire catholique Saint- Fr√®re-Andr√© in the western portion of Toronto. Prior to the opening of ESC P√®re-Philippe-Lamarche, the school board did not operate a secondary school in Scarborough, the easternmost district of Toronto. In April 2011, Conseil scolaire Catholique du Centre-sud purchased property on Eglinton Avenue East from the Toronto Catholic District School Board. The property was a vacant lot, designated as \\"Site 19\\" by TCDSB and was formerly reserved for future use. Conseil scolaire Catholique du Centre-sud began building a new secondary school on the property in 2015. Lamarche was officially opened on 5 September 2017 in a ceremony involving Mitzie Hunter, the Minister of Education, and Marie-France Lalonde, the Minister of Francophone Affairs. Lamarche was the first separate secondary school (English or French) to be opened in Scarborough since 1989, when St. Joan of Arc Catholic Academy opened. The school later held a blessing ceremony in November 2017, presided by Cardinal Thomas Christopher Collins, the Archbishop of Toronto. The new two-storey school was designed by IBI Group.

As a member of the United States Army's Theatre Section during the Second World War, he was the co-choreographer and principal dancer of Irving Berlin's This Is The Army (1942). He choreographed the musical Around the World (1946). He became the romantic partner of the composer and songwriter Cole Porter in the early 1940s. Early life Edgar Nelson Barclift was born on September 14, 1917, in Hopewell, Virginia. Career Barclift found work as a dancer in Kurt Weil's 1937 opera The Eternal Road but the production was postponed as a result of designer Norman Bel Geddes striking water while creating a replica of a mountain at the Manhattan Opera House. Due to the postponement Barclift was able to attend the Bennington School of the Dance in 1937; while there he studied with Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, and Martha Graham. He returned to New York City in the autumn to resume work on The Eternal Road. In 1939 Barclift danced at the World's Fair in New York. His first solo work was in Rodgers and Hart's Too Many Girls (1939). With the entry of the United States into the Second World War, Barclift joined the United States Army in 1942 and was stationed at West Point and Fort Jay, where he was a part of the army's Theatre Section. A romance developed between Barclift and the songwriter Cole Porter during the latter's work on the 1942 musical Something for the Boys. Porter would regularly write to Barclift; often at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning while he was working on songs. Porter's letters often contained Hollywood gossip and flirtatious epithets. Porter addressed Barclift as his \\"cute little nose\\". Barclift later said that \\"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To\\" was his and Porter's 'song'. Barclift wrote an article titled \\"Dancer ‚Äì In the Army\\" for The American Dancer magazine in 1942 about his military service in the ongoing war. Porter wrote to Barclift with gossip and recommendations of friends to see when Barclift was stationed in Italy during the war. Barclift was the principal dancer and co-choreographer of Irving Berlin's This is the Army (1942). He was the choreographer of the musical Around the World (1946). Around the World was produced and directed by Orson Welles, who also wrote the book for the musical. It was composed by Porter. This is the Army ran at the Broadway Theater; the subsequent success of the musical saw it being made into a film of the same name. Barclift also played the dancer Zorina in the show. Recollections The dancer Dorothy Bird recalled dancing with Barclift in her 2002 memoir Bird's Eye View, describing him as a \\"happy-go-lucky lighthearted dancer\\" who was \\"very proud of his native American Indian heritage\\". Bird described Barclift's physique as \\"tall and loose-limbed\\" and related that he was \\"open and generous in his movements\\". Barclift and Bird auditioned for the musical Lady in the Dark, showing their prepared act for the show to the show's choreographer, Albertina Rasch. Bird related in her memoir that Rasch simply appropriated her and Barclift's dance for the show without asking their permission, a common practice at the time. Barclift was drafted into the United States Army during the run of Lady in the Dark, and once surprised Bird by taking his place to dance with her in the musical while on temporary leave. Barclift is mentioned by Christopher Isherwood in his diary entry for April 15, 1968, when he visits Isherwood and asks him to be in a television programme with Laura Huxley. Death Barclift died on March 11, 1993, aged 76, in Palm Springs, California, after a long illness.

Following the invocation of Article 50 to begin Brexit negotiations, most proposals for a new referendum have suggested a choice between accepting the negotiated withdrawal agreement and remaining in the EU, sometimes with the additional option to leave the EU with no deal. In the case of a three- option referendum, voting systems such as supplementary vote, and Borda count have been suggested to allow people to state their second preferences. Reasons that have been cited as justification include campaign finance violations by Vote Leave and Leave.EU, the alleged use of data illicitly harvested by Cambridge Analytica, revelations of Russian interference through fake social media accounts and allegedly through funding, arguments that the \\"Leave\\" camp promoted misinformation, a gradual shift in public opinion, fuelled in part by demographic changes such as adolescents who were to young to take part in the first referendum reaching voting age, and that the eventually-arranged terms of Brexit were unknown at the time of the original vote. The most widely discussed proposal was a referendum between \\"Remain\\" and \\"Accept the deal\\", which was promoted by the People's Vote pressure group. This was the official position of the Liberal Democrats, the Green Party of England and Wales, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party. The Labour Party also adopted this position in September 2019. The Conservative Party and Brexit Party were opposed to any referendum. On 12 December 2019, the Conservative Party, led by Boris Johnson, won an 80-seat overall majority in the 2019 UK general election, which effectively ended the possibility of any referendum on the withdrawal agreement being held before ratification by the UK Parliament or before the UK left the European Union. Subsequently, the UK Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 which received Royal Assent on 23 January 2020, and the United Kingdom formally left the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 January 2020. History A few weeks after the referendum, an e-petition originally set up beforehand on 25 May 2016 by a member of the Leave-supporting English Democrats demanding it be re-run in the event that a supermajority was not reached became the most popular petition on the site, receiving 4,150,262 signatures. On 5 September 2016, the petition received a non-binding debate by Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Grand Committee Room of Parliament's Westminster Hall but its proposal was rejected. The Liberal Democrats and Green Party went into the 2017 United Kingdom general election campaigning in favour of a second referendum, and a minority of pro-European rebels from Labour and the Conservatives also spoke in favour of it. These allied in April 2018 into the People's Vote campaign group. After several cabinet ministers resigned in protest at the Chequers statement setting out the Government's position in the Brexit negotiations, Conservative MP Justine Greening proposed a three-way referendum, using the supplementary vote system in an attempt to avoid vote splitting. The leader of the Trades Union Congress, which is closely allied with Labour, said at its 2018 conference that it would declare in favour of a second referendum if the government failed to get \\"the deal that working people need\\". On 25 September 2018, delegates at the Labour party conference voted in favour of a motion that if Labour did not support Theresa May's deal, and if subsequent attempts to call another general election failed, the party should explore all options, including a second referendum. Some observers saw those conditions as fulfilled by the defeat of the meaningful vote on the 15 January 2019 and the vote of no confidence in May held the following day. However, the Labour leadership did not make any commitments to a referendum at that time. In early December 2018, the Financial Times reported that Leave groups had also started preparing for another referendum. On 18 February 2019, seven pro-European MPs resigned from the Labour Party to form The Independent Group (TIG). Over the following days, another Labour MP and three Conservative Party MPs joined them. All eleven support a referendum. The following week, the Labour Party announced that it would put forward its own second referendum amendment if its attempts to safeguard workers' rights, Single Market access and Customs Union membership fails. In September 2019, the Labour Party adopted the position of holding a public vote on whether to leave or remain regardless of which party negotiated the withdrawal agreement. Parliamentary votes The proposal for a referendum on the withdrawal agreement was first put to Parliament on 14 March 2019 in an amendment (tabled by Sarah Wollaston) to the motion to request the first extension to the Article 50 deadline, where it was rejected by 85‚Äì334, with the Labour Party (and all but 43 of its MPs) abstaining. On 27 March and 1 April 2019, a series of indicative votes was held, both times including a referendum on the withdrawal agreement among the proposals. All proposals failed, with those for such a referendum receiving in the first round 268 Ayes, 295 Noes and 71 abstentions (a majority of 27) and in the second round 280 Ayes, 292 Noes and 62 abstentions (a majority of 12). In both rounds, it was the proposal second-closest to receiving an affirmative majority. Opinion polling Polling companies have asked questions based on a hypothetical future referendum since the 2016 referendum. For most of 2016 and 2017, public opinion was consistently against another referendum and in the event one was called, polling suggested the Leave option would win again. As Brexit negotiations continued however, the Leave lead consistently slipped and public support for another referendum grew. , no poll in the Britain Elects poll-tracker has shown a lead for Leave since April 2018, and political scientist John Curtice has noted \\"a modest but discernible softening of the Leave vote\\". The results of polls asking whether a further referendum should be held vary depending on how the question is phrased: in general a \\"second referendum\\" is less popular than a \\"public vote\\" or similar descriptor. After the scale of Conservative rebellion to the Chequers statement became clear, some polls asked a three-way preference between \\"Remain\\", \\"Deal\\" and \\"No deal\\". The results in this case depend to a great degree on the choice of voting system ‚Äì a first-past-the-post system for example might see a large Remain win due to vote splitting between the two Leave options.

Produced under Fireworks Productions, it starred Sana Sayyad, Nyra Banerjee, Sangita Ghosh, Adhvik Mahajan and Mishkat Varma. Plot The story starts with a pregnant woman, Vidya, meeting with her Guruji. They talk about Shachini, an evil pishaachini and a former disciple of Guruji, who is going after three magical gems. If she gets all three of the gems, she will become so powerful no one will be able to stop her. Guruji has given two of the gems, the Tatva Ratna, with the power to control the elements, and the Mayavi Ratna, with the power of illusions and mind control, to two of his disciples for safekeeping. Shachini, however, killed these disciples with her magic and acquired both the gems, which she wears on a pendant, and their powers. She is now after the third and most powerful of the three gems, the Kaal Vijay Ratna, which has the power to give visions of the future and the power to change the future, which is with Guruji himself. Vidya and Guruji go to his cave, where Shachini appears and asks Guruji for the Kaal Vijay Ratna. Guruji uses magic and pushes Shachini to the side while he throws the gem at Vidya. Shachini, however, recovers and moved in front of the incoming gem to catch it. The Kaal Vijay Ratna then enters her right eye, destroying it and revealing a glowing red light inside it. The gem then goes inside Vidya's womb. Guruji then tells her that her unborn twin children will get the powers of the gem and warns her to beware the dark forces that will come after her and to beware the full moon. He then tells Vidya to run away. Vidya has two daughters, Drishti and Divya. Gifted with superpowers, Drishti has the ability to see the future while Divya has the power to change it. Vidya and Sarthak are worried as Shachini is hunting them down to steal their powers. They manage to save Divya and Drishti but end up sacrificing themselves. The sisters run away but ultimately get separated and adopted by different families. 20 years later Divya and Drishti have grown up. Drishti is mature, and caring while Divya is carefree and free-spirited. They constantly try to find each other, feeling each other's presence at times yet are unable to identify each other. Drishti is hired as the assistant of Rakshit Shergill. Love blossoms between Rakshit and Drishti. Through a series of events, Divya marries Shikhar (Rakshit's cousin) while Drishti marries Rakshit. Divya and Drishti discover the truth about each other and reunite. They decide to find their parents' murderer. Romi is revealed to be the disciple of the priest Chiranjiv who was earlier the disciple of Guruji. Shikhar is revealed to know everything about Shachini. Drishti, Divya, Romi and Shikhar join hands to destroy Shachini and manage to kill her but her soul enters Divya's body, turning her into Divyachini. Drishti manages to separate Divya and Shachini with the help of a powerful and mysterious man named Anjaan and but Shachini reenters her previous body, this time becoming even more powerful. Later, Rakshit is revealed to be Anjaan who posses powers and is trying destroy Shachini. After some days, everyone come to know that the doors of the hell are opening and many evil power are coming out from hell who will try to get the kal Vijay ratna. Divya, Drishti, Rakshit, Shikhar and Romi take the responsibility protect the Ratna. Shachini teams with the evil from hell in order to get the Kaal Vijay ratna for herself. Divya drishti and others manage to kill the evil powers from hell but Shachini becomes successful in taking the ratna and fles away. With all the ratnas in hand Shachini tries to merge the power of all Ratnas but fails. Later, she asks for help from kal devta the evil Lord of hell to help her in merging the powers. He tells her she needs to activate the true power of each of the ratnas. She does so with the Tatva and Mayavi Ratna. On Republic Day, Shikhar is revealed to be not the real son of the family, it was Shikhar's imposter who was helping Pishachini in order to gain powers. Divya kills the imposter. Pishachini successfully activates the Kaal Vijay Ratna, but Divya Drishti blow up the building with a bomb Pishachini placed. The resulting explosion causes Shachini to drop all the ratnas while fleeing and kills Divya Drishti. Thirteen days later, Pishachini lives in the Shergill manor and is controlling the family mysteriously. Divya-Drishti reincarnate and gain new powers to stop Pishachini once and for all(personally, I think since they died with all three ratnas, they gained all their powers). They re-enter the house to find Shachini claiming to be Rakshit's wife. Rakshit has lost all his memories due to the blast. Shachini gives birth to Patali, her and Kaal Devta's daughter who poses to be Rakshit's daughter. Rakshit regains his memories and along with Divya-Drishti, defeats Patali. A few days later, a cunning prisoner escapes from hell fooling the Kaal Devta. He comes through Pisachini's den which leads to the Shergill house and realises that they are a very rich family and decides to rob them. Rakshit traces out the real Shikhar through some detectives using his childhood pictures. The prisoner who has now named himself as Murari, is brought to the Shergill family as the real Shikhar. Shachini kills Patali and puts the blame on Divya, sending her to hell. Drishti, Rakshit, Romi and Murari rescue her. Murari has flashbacks of his forgotten childhood and realises that he is real Shikhar. The Shergill family then find out that Shikhar is from hell, putting a strain on Divya and Shikhar's newly budding feelings. Now, the mysterious Laal Chakor, an old disciple of Guruji, enters. Laal Chakor attacks Rashi, killing her to the chagrin of the Shergill family. To find out Laal Chakor's secret, Divya- Drishti decide to go into the cave, where many years ago the kaal vijay ratna was given to Vidya. They find the cave locked and the only way to open it is with their and their husbands hands on 4 handprints. Divya marries Shikhar since his hand fits the last handprint. After many tries, Divya and Drishti find an oyster, which holds the secret of the cave. Drishti finds out she is pregnant with twins after a sudden vision. During the Shergill family reunion where Rakshit's cousins arrive, Shachini casts a spell, barring every exit with walls that form back when they are broken down. To make matters worse, Laal Chakor is attacking members of the Shergill family, killing everyone except Divya-Drishti, Rakshit and Shikhar, who escaped using a magic chest Divya-Drishti encountered in the cave. After escaping, they make a plan to lure Laal Chakor and Shachini to Divya-Drishti's old house by leaving a note in the Shergill house. A fight ensues between the heroes and the two villains. In a dramatic twist, Laal Chakor is revealed to be Mahima, Rakshit's mother, leaving everyone, especially Rakshit, devastated. Mahima reveals that she was jealous of Vidya because she was given the Kaal Vijay Ratna by Guruji, rather than Mahima, his greatest pupil. Mahima vowed revenge and allied with Shachini to kill Vidya and get the gems. Mahima says she can bring back the dead family members with some magic water which she will give to them only if Divya- Drishti kill themselves. Divya-Drishti do so, releasing the Tatva Ratna, which Shachini takes and the Mayavi Ratna, which Mahima takes. The Kaal Vijay Ratna also came out but disappeared when Divya and Drishti touched hands. Divya and Drishti are resurrected once more, with the help of the two pearls inside the oyster. This came with news that both of them lost their new powers so Drishti can only see the future and Divya only has the power to change it. Also, Drishti's children were due in 48 hours. They return back to the Shergill house, where the family is tricking Mahima and Shachini into thinking that Divya and Drishti are ghosts. During this Shikhar and Divya fall in love and accept their marriage. Guruji is revealed to be alive, having faked his death and being trapped in the cave by Mahima since then. He allies with Divya- Drishti, who are plotting to destroy Shachini and Mahima by turning them on one another. But later he reveals that the Kaal Vijay Ratna was cursed in the first place and he being greedy for powers could not join the three gems and hence approached Vidya, a pure soul who could possibly remove the curse but due to the chaos created by Pisachini before Vidya touched it led the powers to be split to her children. He later disguised himself as Kaal Devta by killing the real Kaal Devta. Drishti gives birth to her twin children shortly after which Laal Chakor and Kaal Devta are killed by Rakshit. Pisachini then acquires all three ratnas which she combines to form the blue Maha Ratna. She transforms into Maha Pishachini and tries to kill Divya and Drishti but Lord Shiva ends her once and for all. Divya-Drishti are later revealed to have lost their powers which they are okay with. Drishti's twins are later shown to have Divya-Drishti's powers, while the Maha Ratna, thought to have gone back to Lord Shiva, is revealed to still be on Earth. The series ends with the family reunited and Rakshit and Drishti holding their twin children.

In October 2019, The Times of India criticised the ongoing track then stating: \\"Divya-Drishti‚Äôs latest storyline is crossing all boundaries of bizarreness. This storyline is full of essence which is just opposite of what we expect from a thriller show. We can just wait and hope to witness something very thrilling in the show, something more real than just mere naivety.\\" Ratings Divya Drishti was the seventh most watched Hindi urban television show in its debut week in India, reaching a TRP of 1.9. Since its premiere, the show has maintained its position in the top 20 most-watched Hindi shows. Crossover Nazar and Divya Drishti had a collaboration where Mohana portrayed by Monalisa from Nazar entered the show Divya Drishti teaming up with Pishachini portrayed by Sangita Ghosh for a sequence.

It was designed for a garrison of 300 soldiers, with three or four cannon. The fort is situated near the town of Bucelas in the Lisbon District of Portugal. History Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. Thus, in July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington landed in Portugal, advanced towards Lisbon and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roli√ßa and Vimeiro, forcing Junot to surrender. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese-British troops and forced to withdraw. However, the threat of further invasions by the French led Wellington to order the construction of the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1809 in order to protect Lisbon from Napol√©on Bonaparte's troops. The work was started immediately after his detailed instructions were issued and carried out until October of the following year. Consisting of 152 forts and redoubts forming three lines of defence over 80 kilometres, making maximum use of the existing topography, the defensive lines were also designed to protect Wellington‚Äôs own retreat and possible evacuation from the Fort of S√£o Juli√£o da Barra on the Tagus estuary if overwhelmed by French forces. The Moat Each fort or other construction was given a number for ease of identification and that allocated to the Fort of Ribas was 51. As with all of the 152 defensive points, it was built by Portuguese labourers and farmers under supervision of British and Portuguese engineers. It is situated on a limestone hill at an altitude of 305 metres and was constructed as an irregular five-sided polygon, with a man-made escarpment with limestone walls, and a dry moat with palisades. It had commanding views over the Freixal gorge and could see several other forts and redoubts, thus making the exchange of military signals easy. Although the first line of forts to the north had been intended by Wellington to provide temporary defence, with the troops eventually retreating to the second line, the first line in fact proved adequate to repel the French troops, and the Fort of Ribas never saw action. It was restored as part of the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Peninsular War and can be reached easily by car, along a dirt road.

Its original name in the local dialect is Pizzaridd. The Pizzarello is a long salty baked bread, seasoned with tomatoes and sometimes also with olives. The baking makes it crunchy. Origins Christians wake up early on Good Friday, in the week of Easter. As they had a long fasting day, during which they could not eat meat, stalls in the streets sold a typical sandwich filled with cheese, tomatoes and other vegetables. The typical Pizzaridd, originally made only for Good Friday, became over time a food produced in some towns, such as Terlizzi, for eating on Fridays generally.

She holds the Canada Research Chair in Public Economic Theory and has been recognized as a McMaster University Scholar. Cuff also serves as Managing Editor of the Canadian Journal of Economics and editor of the Finanzarchiv (Public Finance Analysis).  Biography  Cuff obtained a Bachelors of Arts in Economics with Honours at Queen's University in 1994, then went on to complete a Masters of Arts in Economics at York University in 1995. In 2000, she completed a Ph.D in Economics from Queen's University with her doctoral thesis, Three Essays on Optimal Redistributive Policies. Cuff then joined McMaster University's Department of Economics as an Assistant Professor until 2006, when she became an Associate Professor within the department. In 2016, she was conferred as a tenured Professor of Economics at McMaster University, where she remains at present. Cuff is faculty member of the McMaster Decision Science Laboratory (McDSL), an experimental economics research centre, where she focuses on the topic of funding and financing issues in Canadian healthcare.  Selected publications   \\"Optimal unemployment insurance and redistribution\\" (2018)  Cuff and Robin Bondway undertake an analysis of unemployment insurance and redistributive taxes and transfers in a framework that acknowledges the employment choices of individuals with varying levels of skilled talent. A literature review finds that existing literature on the topic of optimal unemployment insurance is primarily concerned with the moral hazard issues associated with insurance policies, where individuals with insurance may feel a false sense of protection from it and then engage in risky behaviour that they would not otherwise condone. Using a model that utilizes an adaptation of an extensive-margin approach, while taking into account involuntary unemployment due to search frictions whereby individuals may decide themselves how intensely to search for work, the paper tests a number of propositions on optimal wage taxes and income transfers. The paper finds that an optimal policy would address large-scale effects of changes in wages using a \\"piecewise linear wage tax\\", or an income bracket-based approach to taxation that is able to address a variety of different levels of skilled work and productivity. Meanwhile, specific employment taxes and unemployment insurance remain available for redistribution without being overly concerned by potential repercussions of the insurance-moral hazard issue.  \\"Should I stay or should I go? Exit options within mixed systems of public and private health care finance\\" (2016)  A comparative study of mixed public-private finance in healthcare systems that compares the conditions by which users are able to fully exit from the public system and purchase private insurance, and investigates the reasoning behind such exit decisions. The authors used a controlled laboratory experiment that allowed for either 'universal-exit', where any household regardless of income may exit, or 'conditional-exit', where only individuals who satisfy certain conditions may exit‚Äîfor purposes of the experiment, the set condition was high-income. The study confirmed predictions that when presented with the opportunity to exit, high-income individuals generally will generally take it. However, contrary to initial predictions, the results showed that high-income earners are less likely to exit under a universal-exit scenario than a conditional-exit despite identical incentives in both scenarios. The paper offers three potential explanations for why high-income individuals were less likely to exit in a universal-exit scenario: altruism, priming bias, and time-constraint. The first explanation is that high-income individuals may stay and support the public system because they are concerned that, upon seeing all the high-income individuals exiting, low-income individuals will follow suit, leading to the collapse of the public system. Second, a priming bias where high-income individuals might recognize the incentive to exit the system, but feel an obligation to help maintain the public system. This may occur when they feel that \\"the environment into which they are placed is an environment primed with public provision.\\" Finally, it might be that it simply takes time for individuals to realize their incentive to exit the public system. Were the slow collapse and unraveling of the public system to take place at a faster rate, these individuals would then also exit sooner. The paper concludes that individuals in the \\"upper three quintiles\\" would above-all prefer a purely private healthcare system over any type of public system exit, while the rest of the population should strongly prefer a purely publicly financed system without any type of exit option. In an environment where majority-voting is the primary mechanism by which the system is chosen, the latter would win out over any other possible combination.  \\"Capital tax competition and returns to scale\\" (2005)  This paper by Cuff and John Burbridge examines capital tax competition in different regions through a comparison of Nash equilibria using variations of the standard capital tax model. The conclusion finds that inefficiencies in both capital and head taxes can be attributed to regions' incentives to manipulate the terms of trade, rather than any difference in increasing returns.  \\"Equalization and the Decentralization of Revenue‚ÄìRaising in a Federation\\" (2003)  Cuff and Maurice Marchand study a combination of federalism and economics to determine what specific fiscal policies and intergovernmental transfers are required for federal economies that possess regional governments responsible for public services. According to their study, when labour is homogeneous, a wide variety of regional taxation policies can be utilized for purposes of redistribution so long as there is an optimal equalization scheme in place without concern for the cost of migration . On the other hand, if labour is heterogeneous, the costliness of inter-regional migration does have an effect on optimal policies. When migration is costless, \\"the set of instruments that can be used to decentralize the unitary state optimuum\\" is less broad, while when migration is costly, the central government must specifically introduce some incentive to encourage regional governmental redistribution of resources.

Opened in 1959, Alexander Mackenzie was the first Protestant school in St. Albert, and was the first school opened by its board. It was named after Alexander Mackenzie, a Scottish explorer who crossed what is now Canada. The school currently has an enrollment of 530 students.  Programs   Kindergarten  Like all elementary schools within the St. Albert Public Schools district, SAM offers a Kindergarten program for children of at least five years in age. The Kindergarten program prepares students for entrance into the first grade by developing relationship and problem solving skills, as well as providing a foundation in language, writing, and the arts.  Academic Challenge  The academic challenge program is designed for students who excel in their studies and require an additional challenge compared to what would be provided in a regular classroom setting. The program is intended for students with increased ability in areas such as abstract thought and creative thinking. The academic challenge program is offered to students in grades 4-6, and participants must be recommended to the program by the school. Qualification tests are required for entrance into the program. There are 25 students currently enrolled from grades 4-6.  History  Sir Alexander Mackenzie School was the first school built by its parent school board, then known as Protestant Separate School District No. 6, and was the first protestant school in St. Albert. Both the school district and the school were created in order to accommodate a growing population of protestant students in St. Albert. The school was built in 1958 and opened for its first classes in January 1959. The opening of the school was originally planned for the start of the school year in September 1958, but due to disagreements between the architect of the school and the city of St. Albert's building inspectors, the school was not completed until the school year had already been underway. As a result, the school's 98 grade 1 to 7 students and nine teaching staff were forced to hold classes in the basement of the St. Albert United church instead. Two different sites were considered for the school: \\"River Lot 50,\\" and \\"site 3,\\" with the school being built on the former. The latter would eventually become the site of the district's first high school, Paul Kane. The ten acres of land that the school was to occupy was purchased at a cost of $10,000 an acre, with the total cost of the school coming to $374,243 to build. Sir Alexander Mackenzie School was named after Sir Alexander Mackenzie, a Scottish explorer who explored much of what is now Canada. The name was chosen by submission and picked by committee, the choice of which would start a tradition within the district of choosing the names of historical figures for its schools. The school did not always house only elementary students. Until the opening of the district's first high school, at points Alexander Mackenzie school hosted grades up to 11. After the opening of Paul Kane, the school became an elementary-junior high school. It wasn't until 1973 that the school would gain its status as Sir Alexander Mackenzie Elementary School, hosting students from kindergarten to grade 6. An open area was added to the school in 1970, which would later be divided into a library and new classrooms. By 1984 the school had 425 students and 32 staff members, 21 of which were teachers. Presently, the school has 530 students. In 2012, Sir Alexander Mackenzie Elementary School's school district became public at the request of the Alberta government. As a result, SAM is no longer a protestant school.

On behalf of the Danish Women's Society, in 1906 she established a local chapter in her native Thisted in the north of Jutland which she chaired until 1927. She is also remembered for her support of Thisted's music association (Thisted Musikforening) which she headed for almost 20 years. Early life and family Born on 21 January 1848 in Nyk√∏bing Falster, Anna Ingeborg Caroline M√∏ller was the daughter of Lorents Conrad M√∏ller (1807‚Äì66) and Johanne Marie Elisabeth Schrader (born 1812). When she was four, she moved with her parents and elder sister to Copenhagen where she was raised in a well-to-do environment rich in cultural and political contacts. In 1874, she married her cousin Lorentz Conrad M√∏ller, a physician, and moved with him to Thisted. After his early death, she married another physician, Julius Christopher Tolderlund. Professional life Rather than raising children, she devoted her energy to cultural and political activities, inviting leading figures to her home where she organized concerts and meetings. She took a special interest in women's emancipation, lecturing on famous Danish women such as Leonora Christina. In 1901, she helped found the local music association which she chaired from 1907 for almost 20 years. An able pianist herself, she did her utmost to invite outstanding performers, sometimes acting as an accompanist. Her interest in the women's movement began before the turn of the century. In 1906, she established a local branch of the Danish Women's Society in Thisted, prioritizing women's voting rights and eligibility. From 1909, she was a board member of the Women's Society itself, helping to establish additional branches in the north of Jutland. When Danish women were given the vote in 1915, she planted the so-called Women's Oak at Sj√∏rring Vold to the west of the city. She was an active member of the Conservative electoral association and was a candidate in the 1918 elections but was not successful. Ingeborg Tolderlund died in Thisted on 17 January 1935. She is buried in Thisted's S√∏ndre Kirkegaard.

He is one of the three main characters on the show, along with Julian and Bubbles. Portrayed by Robb Wells, the character was created by series creator Mike Clattenburg. Ricky also appears in five films; two short, and three feature length. Before the show, he appeared in the short films The Cart Boy (1995), and Trailer Park Boys (1999). He appears in the feature-length films: Trailer Park Boys: The Movie (2006), Countdown to Liquor Day (2009), and Don't Legalize It (2014). Ricky also appears in numerous spin-offs, including Out of the Park: Europe, Out of the Park: USA, and The Animated Series, for which the latter Robb Wells voices him. Season 12's first episode \\"Chlamydia\\" officially revealed Ricky's last name to be LaFleur. Character biography Ricky is a fun-loving, dim-witted slacker who enjoys marijuana, Jalape√±o Potato Chips, pepperoni, chicken chips, licorice, cigarettes, ravioli, chicken fingers, fish sticks, and alcoholic beverages. He is also a fast-talking schemer. His daughter Trinity is a kleptomaniac and his ex- girlfriend, Lucy, is a stripper. He and Julian have been best friends since they were kids. In the 1999 original black-and-white Trailer Park Boys movie, Ricky used cocaine with his friend Julian, which he references in the first episode of season one: as he is getting out of prison, he tells the camera crew Julian hired that \\"[Julian]'s the one force-feeding me drugs and every other goddamn thing. ...\\" Ricky and Julian have been best friends since childhood and are almost codependent, with Ricky relying on his friend to guide him and keep his antics in check. While good-natured towards his friends and family, Ricky is also selfish, foul-mouthed, volatile, and aggressive, and almost always manages to anger, offend, and alienate those around him. He has always been a troublemaker and often refuses to take responsibility for his actions, illegal or otherwise. He seems to believe that any form of evidence of wrongdoing can be dispensed with simply by flinging it into the air from where he is standing or by submerging it in a nearby lake. As a result, the grounds of the trailer park and the lake are littered with evidence of crimes. A lifetime of drinking, smoking dope, and slacking off have left Ricky with a below-average intelligence, for which he is often ridiculed. Even Ricky considers himself stupid, having repeatedly failed grades before entirely dropping out of school after Grade 9. It is only in Season 2 that Ricky resumes his education; he eventually passes Grades 10 and 11 only to fail Grade 12 in Countdown to Liquor Day. However, he has moments of cleverness and displays practical expertise, as in growing marijuana (at which his skill is unsurpassed), fixing cars, siphoning gas, playing ball hockey, and cooking. He is also extremely adept at fast-talking, negotiating himself and his friends out of seemingly impossible situations with a mixture of quick thinking, confident acting and overwhelming subjects with nonsensical yet somehow credible arguments. Though characters such as Lahey or the police deride him as a loser and a criminal, he's devoted to his friends and family, especially to his daughter Trinity. In the Season 3 premiere, after discovering that he squandered all of his earnings on a successful drug deal from Season 2, Ricky was forced to pick between purchasing his own trailer or buying encyclopedias that he ordered for Trinity; Ricky chose the latter at the expense of having to kiss Lahey's bare buttocks in front of the rest of the trailer park residents. Although he often tries to take the easy way out by breaking the law instead of getting a real job, he occasionally demonstrates dedication to work and education to prove that he's more than a criminal lowlife. Ricky is known for his trademark malapropisms (\\"Denial and error\\"; \\"Catch-23 situation\\"; \\"Get two birds stoned at once\\"; \\"Worst case Ontario\\"; \\"It's clear to see who makes the pants here\\"; \\"gorilla see, gorilla do\\"), dubbed \\"Rickyisms\\" by fans. He usually wears black track pants and a Houndstooth patterned shirt and enjoys listening to Canadian '80s rock bands such as Helix, April Wine, and Kim Mitchell. For most of the series, Ricky lives in and drives the \\"Shitmobile\\", a dilapidated 1975 black Chrysler New Yorker. To his embarrassment, he resembles the hypnotist Peter Reveen. He has also been compared to Elvis Presley. In season 8, Ricky gets a pet goldfish named \\"Orangie\\", who dies because Ricky fills his bowl with alcohol in an attempt to \\"party\\" with the fish. Bubbles convinces Ricky that the fish is merely in a deep slumber, eventually employing Jacob and Cory to replace the fish without Ricky's knowledge. For the remainder of the season, Bubbles keeps a supply of \\"Orangies\\" in his shed as replacements as Ricky repeatedly kills his pet. In season 9, Ricky acquires a pet baby goat, which he names \\"Willy Goat\\"; Ricky also becomes a grandfather in season 9 when Trinity gives birth to a son, The Motel, of whom Jacob Collins is the father. Ricky struggles to accept this at first, but soon seems to realize that Jacob is similar to himself and gives Jacob his blessing to marry Trinity. As in previous seasons, Ricky remains devoted to his family, including his new grandson, and to his pets despite his attempts to get them drunk and stoned. In the ninth episode of season 10, Ricky is shot by Pvt. Dancer, who struggled with Jim Lahey, after they agreed that they would kill someone to solve their problems. Alcohol was involved. The bullet struck his temporal lobe, sending him into a coma. During this coma, in episode 10, a very drunk Jim Lahey visited Ricky. At this time, Lahey claimed that Ricky was his biological son, explaining that this caused Ricky's mother to leave Sunnyvale and Jim and Ray to hate each other. However, in Season Eleven, after Ricky discovers the \\"truth\\" of his heritage, it is revealed that Lahey is not his father, although Lahey himself firmly believed that he was. After doing research at the hospital, Bubbles and Julian discovered that neither Lahey nor Ray are Ricky's biological father, but they continue to let him believe that Ray is his real father, as he is the man who raised him. Reception and legacy College Humour described Ricky by saying: \\"... it's Ricky that keeps us coming back ‚Äì the dumbest of the show's core trio, often the highest, sometimes the scummiest, but always uniquely himself. We love you, Ricky, you greasy bastard\\". Screen Rant described Ricky by saying: \\"The audience learns about the details of the crime later, and our knowledge of Ricky gets filled in the same way. We don't know much about him at first except what we hear about him from other people. Then we see the rumors come to life with hilarious and cringeworthy results. Even the most popular guy in the trailer park has his secrets.\\"https://screenrant.com/tailer-park-boys-never-knew-ricky/ In 2005, Robb Wells in character as Ricky, along with Mike Smith and John Paul Tremblay as Bubbles and Julian, threw out the first pitch at the home opener of the 2005 Toronto Blue Jays season at the Rogers Centre.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. It now serves as a vacation rental. History The first European settlers arrived in the Clark Lake area in 1833. In 1835, Ephraim and Nellie Hitt, along with their young son Gordon, moved from Delaware County, New York to this location and purchased 50 acres of land. They built a log cabin near the shore of Clark Lake, but later built a new home further north along North Lake Road. This home was destroyed by a fire in the 1860s. By this time Gordon was grown, and in 1868 he constructed a new farmhouse near the site of the older building. Around the same time, a group of barns was constructed across the road from the house. Over the next three decades, the Hitt farm expanded from 50 acres to 270 acres. By the 1890s, Gordon Hitt had died, and his son Elmer built a second house near the main one for his mother (and Gordon's widow) Eliza Hitt. He constructed a small garage in 1912. By this time, Clark Lake was becoming a recreation hub, and in the 1920s, Elmer and his son Gordon sold off lots along the lakeshore for cottages. Into the twentieth century, the usage of the Hitt farmstead changed. The farm decreased in size, and in the 1930s, Gordon Hitt operated a boys' summer camp on the site. The farm eventually passed to Gordon's son Richard. Richard operated it as a bed and breakfast for a time. He died in 2008. The farm passed to younger member of the Hitt family, and now serves as a private vacation rental. Description The Hitt Farmstead includes a complex of buildings on either side of North Lake Road. On one side are the two-story main house, a smaller 1-1/2-story secondary house, a garage and small shed. On the other side are two large gambrel roof barns, the foundation of a third barn, and a one-story gable roof outbuilding. The main house is a two-story, Upright and Wing balloon frame house with intersecting gable roofs covered with asphalt shingles. It sits on a fieldstone foundation, and is covered with clapboards and vertical cornerboards. A single-story gabled dining room and kitchen ell extends from the rear of the house. The upright portion is one bay wide, and side-gabled wing portion is three bays wide, fronted by a single-story porch running for two bays. The front entrance is located near the junction of the upright and wing. Two more porches are located in the rear. All porches have hipped roofs and are decorated with cut-outs, paneled bases and floral brackets. The windows throughout the house are tall, two-over-two double-hung sash units in slightly arched openings flanked by shutters with their tops cut to match the arches of the windows. The secondary house is a 1-1/2-story, front-gabled balloon framed structure covered with horizontal clapboard siding with flat corner boards. A small single-story side-gabled kitchen ell is located to one side of the main section. A hipped roof, single-story porch wraps around the house from the ell across the front and onto the other side. The porch has a plain geometric railing. The windows are one-over-one double- hung units, paired on the gable ends. Two smaller buildings are located nearby on the same side of the road: a small wooden single-story gable roof garage, and a small gabled chicken coop/storage shed. Across the road are two barns and another outbuilding. The outbuilding is a single-story, gable roof post and beam structure on a limestone foundation. It is covered with horizontal siding with flat corner boards, and has a pair of side-hinged vertical plank doors. The two barns are joined, gambrel structures sited nearby, with their roof ridgelines perpendicular to each other. The barns sit on limestone foundations. The lower levels of the barns are covered with vertical board and batten siding, with horizontal drop siding identical to that on the outbuilding on the upper section of one, and newer board and batten siding on the upper level of the other. The roofs of all three buildings are covered with asphalt shingles.

The main reasons of its birth are, on one hand, a more flexible work generation, characterized by the fact that workers don‚Äôt own an office anymore and they need a space to work. On the other hand, the phenomenon has developed due to the lack of studying spaces in universities, which have seen an increase among the enrolled students, who had to face this problem by looking for different spaces to study and meet for group-work: they found in coffeehouses a productive space to work for their projects and study. Furthermore, the diffusion of this phenomenon has generated a series of studies from sociologists to psychologists, who investigated the phenomenon from a cultural and social point of view, discovering that background sounds, or having people around can increase one's brain productivity.  History and origins  The tendency of using coffee-shops as a place to study and work for both students and workers has its genesis in the late 20th century and it‚Äôs now a global trend. Concerning workers, this phenomenon is deeply embedded in the 21st century Post-Fordism paradigm and in its way of conceiving flexibility as a key feature in modern age organizations. The rise of Information Technology and the shift from Mass marketing to flexible specialization have softened the boundaries between home life and work life. Companies tend to focus on results and goals, leaving the employees free of time or place constraints. A Gallup survey showed that, not only american employees and employers are working more remotely, but this practice, viewed as broadly beneficial, is actually boosting productivity. On the other hand, students, and especially millennials, often in response to the lack of scholastic or university places to study, have started to use coffee-shops for studying and or leisure purposes. The development of internet caf√©s, providing Internet access to the public under the payment of a time-based fee, and of chains such as Starbucks that offer customers wi-fi connection and places to stay regardless of time spent, has boosted the spread of the coffee-shop effect. The coffee-shop effect has developed mainly in big European (especially in Northern Europe) and American cities but is becoming more and more a global trend.  Psychological and social aspects  With the emerge of coworking and the increasing presence of such places, with the lack of available study areas in schools and universities, and namely with the growing popularity of flexible work environments and nomad working, especially among millennials and entrepreneurs, the adepts of the trend have started to switch towards an even more informal environment: the coffehouse. What makes them choose this kind of space over others, is mostly due to its direct connection with productivity and the positive impact on work‚Äôs outcome. From a psychological standpoint, scholars in the field have identified various elements that play a role in influencing people to come to coffeehouses to work or study. Firstly, it has been noted that by pursuing a mind related activity in a coffee shop, the brain‚Äôs neuroplasticity is exercised. Not only that, but it also contributes to combating routine and predictability, which basically accommodate the brain with an easily formed schedule, not efficient for activities like brainstorming or innovation focused tasks. Moreover, it has been proved that by being exposed to new stimuli, in this given case, the lively atmosphere of the cafes (background noises, the scent of coffee and cakes etc.), the brain tends to create new mechanisms to accomplish tasks, and ultimately, break unproductive routines. According to evolution scientists, the human brain is naturally, thus constantly in a search for novelty, which nowadays, coffeehouses seem to offer, predominantly from a working/studying perspective. Known in popular culture as the ‚ÄúShiny Object Syndrome‚Äù (SOS), or ‚ÄúThe Disease of distraction‚Äù, name inspired by a child‚Äôs run after a shiny object, in the coffeehouse working scenario, the shiny object, or the novelty refers to the new environment, that helps the brain to release dopamine. Until recent studies, dopamine could be felt as a reward, but currently, the scientific findings tie it to a boost in motivation, therefore emphasizing the fact environments have a big say in performance and work‚Äôs aftermath. Along with the effect on performance, working in a coffeehouse contributes to habit formation, since it is likely the brain will connect the place to an environment where work is done not only efficiently, but creatively. The mental significance a coffeehouse gets after being used as an office/study zone reinforces the concept of brandscape, which was described by General Mills as ‚Äúa symbolic space that is a familiar and comfortable home for consumers‚Äù. Even if this notion is more effectively put into practice by the so-called experience economy retailers, such as Disney or Apple, coffehouses‚Äô atmospherics enable their consumers to encounter a whole vibe: the musical selections (from jazz to hip indie), the furnishings with a vintage, ‚Äúartsy‚Äù vibe, or the hipster staff, all contributing to the sense of community and belonging. Through social lenses, it is important to mention the ‚ÄúThird Places Theory‚Äù, coined by Ray Oldenburg (1989), which points out there are some public spaces that exist between the formality and seriousness of the work sphere and the privacy and familial intimacy of domestic sphere ‚Äì exactly where coffeehouses are placed in this day and age. In public imagination, they‚Äôre at the border of a variety of antagonisms, such as work and play, online and offline, public and private, presence and co-presence, individual and community, or local and global, increasing their valorization for contemporary culture and constantly intertwining their meaning.  Marketing perspective  The marketing and financial consequences of this expanding trend are bipolar, creating a bifurcation in the coffee shops market. Owners of coffee shops might not always see this trend as a source of income, even though most of them consider this a great idea to improve their caf√©s and get more people to buy their products, others consider this counterproductive. In today's online-driven world, this might be seen as a risk, mainly because many people, like students or office workers, go to caf√©s just to have a space to work, occupying a table for many hours a day, provoking a loss for the owner. This means that in the short-run this trend might actually hurt the business of coffee houses, hence it's not well-seen by many caf√© owners. ‚ÄúWe don't want to be an office.‚Äù - some caf√© owners are ‚Äúpulling the plug‚Äù on Wi-Fi in their bars, not only for economic reasons, but also for a problem of atmosphere: they hope to create more of a community in their bars, where people talk instead of typing on their computers for hours. Teamwork in a coffeehouse The other side of the coin concerns the benefits in terms of revenues that this type of coffee shops can have on the business. Of course, adapting to the new standards of internet caf√©s, with big tables, wi-fi, and even computers accessible to the public, is an expense for the owners, but the potential profits made thanks to this arrangement could be really high. Many caf√©s are starting to develop a new way of conceiving their bars as a profitable coworking space, implementing areas with couches, internet lounges, wall outlets, and offering office spaces and conference rooms. The marketing strategy can also comprehend packaged deals, which could be a valid solution for those who are afraid of damaging their business with this type of activity. Packaged deals usually include promotions like ‚Äúbuy x time of internet and get free coffee‚Äù or to give the possibility of printing, scanning and faxing if you consume something at the bar. These are useful ways to make profits with internet caf√©s, since this new business can sometimes seem scary for owners. From the brand point of view, associating work with consumption could potentially be disruptive: people going to caf√©s to study or work might start thinking of that particular bar as the place where work is done, and not as a relaxing pleasant space. This could affect the brand image of the caf√©, which is going to be considered more like an ‚Äúoffice‚Äù, which is exactly what many coffee shop owners are trying to avoid, to maintain a certain image of their shop. That‚Äôs the case of the Rose Cafe in Venice, California; like most cafes, the Rose doesn‚Äôt provide electrical outlets, to avoid consumers staying there all day long. Some remote workers have gotten the message and try to do their part. Jocelyn Johnson, who founded VideoInk, relies on remote work sites including the Rose. She has defined a code of conduct: her self-imposed rules include working in one cafe or restaurant no more than three mornings a week, for no more than three hours. She always orders a coffee and pastry, and frequently a lunch to go, to make sure she is not imposing on the chosen caf√©. In an interview for The New York Times, she says that she once tried a weekend brunch there, only to realize that it felt too much like the office.  Pop- culture trends  There are some websites like HipsterSound and CoffitivityCoffitivity that recreates the background sounds of a caf√© in order to boost creativity and help people work in a better way. The sounds are divided in specialized playlists useful for any occasion, for example some of them being: ‚Äúmorning murmur, lunchtime lounge, university undertones, Brazil bistro‚Äù. Youtube has also created playlists which retreat background noises you find in a coffeehouse. The playlists vary from internal sounds of dishes, mugs and coffee machine, to external sounds like rain drop falling on the windows. Spotify has also created coffeehouse sounds playlists such as ‚ÄúCaf√© sounds‚Äù, ‚ÄúStarbucks coffee sounds\\", \\"The coffeehouse crowd\\".

Biography Arthur was born into a wealthy merchant family in Cork around 1560. In his youth he went into service of the state in Dublin and later in Cork. He assisted Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. He left public service after the death of his eldest brother and managed the family business. This took him to England on many occasions where he witnessed the martyrdom of several English Catholic priests. Their example inspired him to enter seminary. He studied in Louvain and Douai and was ordained for the diocese of Limerick around 1598. He was not related to Bishop Thomas Arthur of Limerick 1468-1486. This was a particularly dangerous time for priests in Ireland and many were hunted by Puritans. Arthur was known for taking over the ancient mensal parishes of St Mary's and St John's for Catholic worship. During this period he kept on the move and was known to move about in disguise and offer Mass and preach secretly throughout the west, south and southeast of Ireland as far as Galway, Cork and Kilkenny. In 1620 after a period as Vicar General Arthur was appointed bishop and he received consecration in 1623 where the principle consecrator was bishop Rothe of Ossory. Arthur was already 63 when consecrated and was never in great health. After being bishop for seven years he asked Rome for a coadjutor. An assistant was not forthcoming though so he had to labour on in difficult circumstances. In the final years of his life Limerick was besieged twice during the Confederate period. Despite the difficulties the Confederate period was one when Catholics could function open and freely so Arthur was able to welcome Capuchins and Jesuits to Limerick. During this period the Papal Legate Archbishop Rinuccini was able to visit Limerick and assess the situation. Rinuccini was in Limerick in 1646 when Arthur died and he describes his death in his memoirs, the Commentarius Rimiccinianus.

She specializes primarily in crime and racial discrimination. She hosts the podcast Probable Causation, which is about law, economics, and crime. She also co-organizes the \\"Online Seminar on Discrimination and Disparities.\\"  Education and career  Jennifer Doleac received her B.A. in Economics and Mathematics from Williams College in 2003. She completed her PhD in economics from Stanford University in 2012 and worked at the University of Virginia Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy from 2012 to 2018. During this time, she also worked with The Lab @ DC as a crime consultant, and was a nonresident Fellow at the Brookings Institution. She moved to Texas A&M; Department of Economics as an associate professor with tenure in 2018.  Research and academic work  Doleac has published many academic studies and general interest pieces on crime, racial discrimination, and prisoner reentry.  Racial discrimination  She and Luke Stein conducted a randomized controlled field experiment testing for racial discrimination in secondary markets. The yearlong experiment consisted of approximately 1,200 online classified advertisements placed in over 300 areas throughout the United States, both small towns and large cities, with the intention of testing for racial bias among buyers. The experiment featured photographs of a person's hand holding an iPod. Doleac and Stein randomly varied the skin color of the person's hand: dark-skinned (\\"Black\\"), light-skinned (\\"White\\"), or light- skinned with a tattoo. In all other respects, the photographs were nearly identical. Consistent with other studies on racial bias in the marketplace, Doleac and Stein found that black sellers did considerably worse than white sellers along numerous dimensions. For instance, black sellers got 13 percent fewer responses and 18 percent fewer offers of purchase from interested buyers. When they did receive an offer, that offer was around 11 percent lower. These effects were similar to those associated with the white tattooed hand which was the placebo group in the study.  DNA databases  Doleac has also written on issues related to contemporary crime control, such as the use of DNA databases to deter and capture criminals, as well as the role of outside lighting. Her work on lighting with Nicholas J. Sanders used a 2007 natural experiment where Congress increased daylight saving time by four weeks. They added three weeks in the spring and one week in the fall. Doleac and Sanders used this as an opportunity to study the effect that daylight, separate from other seasonal factors, might have on crime, and found that when daylight saving time began in the spring, robbery rates for the entire fell 7 percent with an additional 27 percent drop during the evening hour that gained extra sunlight. This study is relevant for broader consideration in crime control that focuses on expanding lighting to high crime areas with external lighting. Doleac has also studied the role of DNA databases on reducing crime both through deterrence and capturing criminals (i.e., incapacitation). Several states have passed laws allowing DNA testing of arrestees. Following famous work by Nobel Laureate Gary Becker, Doleac hypothesizes that the availability of these DNA databased would deter criminals as well as catch criminals insofar as criminals are sensitive to the risk of arrest. Violent offenders who have had their DNA collected and catalogued in digital databases were 23 percent more likely to be convicted of another crime implying that profiled offenders were caught more often than those who hadn't been stored in the database. Given the extraordinarily high costs of incarceration, Doleac suggests that DNA databases are considerably more cost-effective than other ways of reducing crime such as hiring more police or through incarceration.  Ban the Box  Doleac has also written extensively both an academic study and general interest writings on prisoner reentry. Prisoner reentry is a considerable challenge in the United States due to the ubiquity of background checks and the myriad of obstacles prisoners face reentering the labor force upon release. An increasingly popular policy at the federal, state and municipality level is the \\"ban the box\\" initiative. Employers often will ask applicants for jobs if they have any prior arrests or convictions by checking Yes or No on a \\"box\\". The ban the box initiative are laws, oftentimes at the city level, banning employers' right to ask this information of applicants during the earliest stages of the application process. In a 2018 article published in the Journal of Labor Economics, Doleac and Benjamin Hansen from the University of Oregon found that the laws had unintended consequences on the hiring of low skill minorities. The authors found that ban the box policies lowered the chances of employment by 5 percent for young, low-skilled black men and almost 3 percent for young, low-skilled Hispanic men. The authors argue that this effect was caused by rampant statistical discrimination in labor markets. Without information on a candidate's criminal history, employers make extreme racially biased assumptions that the applicant is similar to his or her demographic. Thus seeing a black applicant, even one without a criminal history, the firm \\"fills in\\" the missing information by assuming he or she is like the group average, and thus is more likely to believe the applicant has a criminal history, even when they do not.

In 1870, he was one of seventeen leaders of the Austrian workers' movement convicted of treason and sentenced to five years penal servitude. He was released after just one year, as part of an amnesty, and became increasingly outspoken in his political views, arguing against any co- operation with the middle and upper classes. He fell out with Heinrich Oberwinder, who lost a lengthy court case to Scheu, but Scheu promised that he would not stand in the way of attempts to reunify the Austrian socialist movement. Also facing harassment from the government and financial problems, Scheu moved to London in June 1874, where his brother Heinrich worked for the Daily Graphic. In London, Scheu initially became involved with two groups of socialist immigrants, but became convinced that he could achieve more by focusing on British workers. He moved to Glasgow and then Edinburgh, working for furniture designers, and spoke regularly on socialism, convincing John Burns and Robert Banner of his ideas. He returned to London in 1881, where his friend Johann Most was now living, helping him with editing Freiheit, and also struck up a friendship with Bernard Shaw. He joined the Democratic Federation and served on its executive from at least 1883, working with Joseph Lane and William Morris to oppose H. M. Hyndman's nationalism and authoritarianism. They appeared to succeed at the organisations 1884 conference, at which it declared itself to be a socialist organisation, renamed itself as the \\"Social Democratic Federation\\" (SDF), and Scheu won election as president. After the 1884 conference, Scheu returned to work in Edinburgh. There, John Lincoln Mahon persuaded Scheu that the SDF would not succeed unless it linked up with the crofters' movement, and so the pair formed the Scottish Land and Labour League, intending that it would affiliate to the SDF. Hyndman disagreed with this policy, and urged the local SDF to refuse the league permission to affiliate. On Morris' urging, Scheu visited London in December, to defend his actions, against Hyndman. Scheu had already been urging his supporters to split from the SDF, and this proved the trigger for this, launching Commonweal at the end of the year, then forming the Socialist League, with Scheu sitting on its provisional council and drafting its manifesto. Despite claims to the contrary by Hyndman and his supporters, Scheu was not an anarchist, and when anarchists came to run the Socialist League, he resigned from the party. Scheu was one of the first employees of Jaeger, from 1884, serving until 1891, when he began representing the L√∂wenbr√§u Brewery. He reduced his activism, but wrote for Justice under the pseudonym \\"Andrew Joy\\", and lectured occasionally for the Hammersmith Socialist Society. He retired in 1911, moving to Weimar, but opposed World War I and so in 1915 relocated to Switzerland. He enthusiastically supported the October Revolution and ensuing uprisings in Germany and Austria, and wrote an autobiography, Umsturzkeime, published in 1923. His heath declined, and in 1927 he died in Rapperswil.

She produced and designed fabrics for leading Parisian fashion houses including Chanel, Lanvin, House of Worth, Schiaparelli and Paul Poiret. She died at the age of 82, on 13 January 1986, after becoming a RDI, a Royal Designer for Industry, the ultimate accolade for any designer in Britain.  Biography   Early life  Jacqueline Groag was born as Hilde Pick to Jewish parents on 6 April 1903. She later changed her name to Jacqueline Groag when she married modernist architect Jacques Groag in 1937.  Education  As a child she had been in poor health and, unlike her siblings, had been educated at home. She learned all the subjects of the education curriculum, but with no formal exams ‚Äî something that left her (in her own words) a \\"sophisticated na√Øve\\". Groag studied textile design in Vienna and thrived under the schooling of professor Franz Ci≈æek, who was delighted by her lack of previous formal art education, during the 1920s. Franz Ci≈æek also recommended her to Josef Hoffmann, head of the Wiener Werkst√§tte, where she became one of his students in the design school of the Kunstgewerbeschule. As a student she won first prize in a competition organised by the Kunstgewerbeschule.  Vienna  In 1930, Groag was mentioned in an article by Dr. Hans von Ankwicz for the German publication Deutsche Kunst und Dekoration on her work. Ankwicz described her as a \\"front-runner of the Hoffmann school\\" who \\"currently dominated the design of textiles, particularly prints\\".  The Second World War  In 1938, Jacqueline and Jacques fled to Prague, Czechoslovakia due to the Nazi unification of Austria and Germany, the Anschluss. Their stay in Prague didn't last long as they were forced to flee Prague in 1939 for London following the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia. When they arrived in London, they were greeted by the leading member of the British Design Factory, including Sir Gordon Russell, Sir Charles Reilly and Jack Pritchard.  Work  During the 1930s Jacqueline Groag travelled to cities such as Paris and New York to enhance her international reputation. She was awarded a gold medal for textile design at the Milano Triennale in 1933 and another gold medal for printed textiles at the Paris Exposition in 1937. Post Second World War  In 1945 she received the accolade of one of her dress fabrics being chosen by the couturier Edward Molyneux for a collection of dresses for Her Majesty the Queen. In 1947 Jacqueline and Jacques gained British citizenship and became members of the Society of Industrial Artists. In 1951 the Festival of Britain took place, and most of the contemporary styles of textiles and wallpapers where heavily influenced by her work from the 1940s. From that point she became a major influence on pattern design internationally with clients like the Associated American Artists, Hallmark Cards and John Lewis. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s she became more and more involved with Sir Misha Black and the Design Research Unit (DRU), working on the interiors of boats, aircraft and trains. She especially worked on the design of textiles and plastics for British Overseas Airways Corporation and British Rail. She also got a commission from Misha Black in the 1970s to make a moquette for London Transport, for seating on buses and tube trains.

Anjali blackmails Bharathi to marry her or else she will commit suicide Bharathi says he will talk with his mother after her (Anjali's) birthday party which is arranged by Soundharya later Bharathi meets Kannamma and Anjali's father and asks his permission to marry Kannamma and reveals that he cannot sire children and asks Kannamma's father to tell this to Kannamma. If she accepts this, he will marry her in a temple. Kannamma's father is unable to find relations for Kannamma and accepts the proposal, but doesn't inform Kannamma about Bharathi's inability to have children. Kannamma is happy that a man with a good heart will marry her. On Anjali's birthday, Bharathi marries Kannamma without anyone from either side and brings her to the birthday party. Soundharya becomes angry that Bharathi married the swarthy girl. Anjali is furious that Bharathi married her elder sister, not her. Akhil, Bharathi's younger brother and Bharathi's father Venu Gopalakrishnan (Rishi Keshav) are happy, However. After some insults, Soundharya allows Kannamma to be in the house and later Anjali marries Akhil but Anjali wants to get rid of Kannamma and Anjali and wants to marry Bharathi but she eventually fails and Soundharya senses odd behavior of Anjali and warns her to be a good wife and daughter-in-law or she will expel. Anjali stops the attempts and starts loving Akhil. Meanwhile, A new character, Dr.Venba(Farina Azad), enters, obsessive lover of Bharathi starts to target the couple, she was also Bharathi's childhood friend. Soundharya likes Venba as she is fair-skinned. Venba becomes angry when she learns Bharathi is married and promises herself she will get him back. Kannamma consults Venba as she wants to get pregnant and wants to know why she isn't expecting yet and Bharathi discusses this with Venba and she convinces Bharathi to change the reports before all of this. Bharathi and Kannamma go for Kannamma‚Äôs school reunion. Venba is there too. A new character, Varun(Raju Jeyamohan), Kannamma's classmate is introduced and Venba makes Bharathi believe Kannamma is cheating on him with Varun. Meanwhile, Kannamma gives some things that a sister gives to a brother. They return from there and Venba manipulates Bharathi more and more so he blindly believes Kannamma is cheating on him. Currently, Kannamma believes the reports that she can't have children. Soundharya learns of this and wants Bharathi to marry again. Venba is happy about this as she believes Soundharya will choose her to be Bharathi's second wife but is betrayed when Soundharya chooses someone else. Soundharya informs Bharathi that she will engage him to another woman the next day. Bharathi is shocked by this and asks Kannamma if she knows about the engagement while Kannamma is fast asleep. Kannamma doesn't answer. The next day Kannamma awakens and is shocked to hear about preparations of engagement. Kannamma cries, thinking her Bharathi mama accepted this. Kannamma's father learns of the engagement and stops it. Soundharya lashes out at him, saying Kannamma can't bear the children. The other day Kannamma had some symptoms of pregnancy So with the advice of Arivumani(kavya)(Bharathi‚Äôs sister) she takes a pregnancy test and it turns out to be positive and tells Soundharya Bharathi doesn't need to marry again as Kannamma is pregnant. This shocks everyone, including Bharathi. Kannamma hears of the pregnancy and is happy. Soundharya starts to care for Kannamma as she bears the heir of their house. Meanwhile, Bharathi once again goes to test whether or not he can have children. It is revealed that he can, but Venba changes the reports to state he cannot. It is revealed that Venba is responsible for Bharathi's misconception. Venba tells her paternal uncle that she has loved Bharathi from her college days. Bharathi loved another girl, Hema(Alya Manasa). She planned an accident when they were going on a road trip and she killed Hema and bribed the doctor to say Bharathi cannot have children so Bharathi doesn't marry anyone else and so she could complete her studies in the USA and return and marry him. Ironically Bharathi is a Cardiologist and Venba is a Gynaecologist. After seeing Soundharya love and care for Kannamma, Venba attempts to kill her multiple times but fails. Venba approaches the serial killer Durga who only kills bad people. Venba convinces him that Kannamma cheated on her friend Bharathi and that he wants to get rid of her. Durga accepts the deal and enters as the car driver especially for Kannamma. Kannamma is sad that Bharathi is behaving oddly with her and showing no sign of happiness for the pregnancy. Kannamma goes to her parents where even her father treats her weirdly, so tearful Kannamma returns. Meanwhile, Durga continues his plan for killing Kannamma. First, he tries to kill her when she goes to the temple along with the family. But, Bharathi comes to the rescue and saves Kannamma. A happy Soundharya continues to shower her with lots of affection. She plans to build a hospital in the name of Kannamma, despite Bharathi's refusal. Durga again plans to kill Kannamma by creating a cut in the water heater so that Kannamma may die with an electric shock. But, Nimmi, the housemaid gets the electric shock, which becomes unfatal. Soundharya then starts up entertainment by mimicry and acting, to bring some more happiness in the house. Here, Anjali notices something wrong with Akhil. He leaves in between and involves himself in secret meetings with an unknown person. It is revealed that Akhil was offering help to a girl named Meena by offering remuneration for her designing course and helping her to be a model for his photoshoot. Soundharya then prepares everything to celebrate Kannamma's baby shower with pomp and grandeur. Noticing this as a good chance to kill Kannamma, Venba gifts a poisoned lipstick to Kannamma. Kannamma becomes very happy in her baby shower with her mother-in-law's affection but is unhappy with the weird behavior of Bharathi and Shanmugam. It is also revealed that instead of Kannamma, Anjali has used the poisoned lipstick and so, she faints. Akhil and the family-run into shock and takes the unconscious Anjali to the hospital. An unsuccessful Venba somehow manages to save Anjali by wiping off the lipstick. But the innocent Anjali assumes that she has fallen unconscious due to food poisoning. After the baby shower, Kannamma feels restless as Shanmugam contemplates to speak with her. She feels very sombre but tries to overcome sadness. The next day, while Durga enters Barathi's home, he suffers an epileptic attack. But, a kind Kannamma does her best to save him by offering first aid at the right time. This makes Durga realize that Kannamma is indeed a kind-hearted woman. After recovering from the attack, Durga confronts Venba by stating that Kannamma can never be a wrong woman and his conscience supports it. Venba immediately spills out the beans that Kannamma was indeed a good woman and that she was planning to kill her. Shocked by this fact, Durga warns Venba to refrain herself from doing wrong things, but Venba refuses. An angry Durga challenges Venba that he will protect Kannamma from any evil and remain loyal to her forever. Alarmed by this, Venba tries to get rid of Durga and Kannamma altogether by hiring another henchman named Babu, who is Durga's friend-turned-enemy. When Kannamma, Arivu, and Durga are on their way to the temple, Babu tries to kill them by hitting their car with a lorry and succeeds. But, Kannamma and Arivu, noticing that they are in danger and that the car is in fire due to the accident, plans to escape. But, a kind Kannamma saves the unconscious Durga, even when they were in danger. The three then go to a hospital and informs the family about the accident. Arivu and Kannamma suffer minor injuries whereas Durga got a heavy injury. On recovery, Durga confesses to Kannamma that he was recruited to kill her and that Barathi was the one who has asked him to do so. A furious Kannamma then goes to her home and prepares to leave the home to save herself and her unborn child. Upon her angry expression, the family gets confused and asks her the reason why she is taking such a solemn decision. Kannamma then reveals to the entire family that the attacks that the family has witnessed earlier were planned indeed by Barathi and it was on the motive to eliminate Kannamma and her unborn child. Soundharya angrily argues with Kannamma that Barathi is her child and he would never take such a decision to kill a human, being a doctor himself. Bharathi then enters the scene. Soundharya questions Bharathi on why he was restless these many days and asks him whether Kannamma's statement was true. Bharathi promises on Soundharya that he did not plan to kill Kannamma. He also states that he was infertile and was not eligible to give birth to a baby. And that was why he was shocked at Kannamma's pregnancy and showed anger toward her. He even shows his fertility test reports to the entire family and says that Kannamma has cheated him by having an affair with another man and that the baby she holds was not his child. He also says that her father also knows before the wedding that he was infertile. Upon hearing this, a furious Kannamma streaks like a fire. She argues with Barathi and says that he will wash her feet with his tears when he knows the truth and leaves the family. Other family members try to stop her but Soundarya gets a Heart attack seeing kanamma. Then take her to the hospital and nurses her. Meanwhile, Akilan goes to search Kannamma but ends up in vain. Venba meets Kanamma and asks her to abort the baby because she has no money. Kannamma gives a handful to Venba. She also goes to meet her father and says she'll repay him for his deeds. She works in a roadside hotel with an old couple for living. Soundarya searches Kanamma and meets with an accident. Kanamma rescues her and donates blood to save her without knowing the family. She goes to a petrol bunk held by women and works there. Soundarya and Venu meet Varun know the truth that Kanamma treats like a brother. Barathi is suspended for drinking alcohol and trying to do an operation. Barathi on Venba's advice decides to divorce Kanamma. Kannamma says she'll only divorce him after giving birth to her baby and prove it's their child. Meanwhile, Durga learns the truth that Venba loves Barathi and she tried to kill Kanamma nd Kanamma learns the truth. An angry Kanamma gives a handful to Venba for liking other women's Husband and ask her to stay away. Soundarya meets Kanamma and calls her home but the latter rejects. She also tries to help her financially but later rejects and moves away.Later Soundharya tries to convince Bharathi to take the test , but Bharathi doesn't listen to her after .

Their most notable characteristic is their extraordinary specificity. They inactivate ribosomes by cutting a single phosphodiester bond of the rRNA that is found in a universally conserved sequence. This cleavage leads to cell death by apoptosis. However, since they are extracellular proteins, they must first enter the cells that constitute their target to exert their cytotoxic action. This entry constitutes the rate-determining step of their action. No protein receptor has been found. Thus, in order to penetrate the cells, they must take advantage of changes in permeability and the biophysical properties of the membranes, produced by phenomena such as tumour transformation or a viral infection. This is why Œ±-sarcin, the most representative member of the group, was originally discovered as an antitumoural agent. However, it turned out not to be as safe as needed and the research in this field was temporarily abandoned. One of the determining factors in this process of entry into cells appears to be their ability to interact with phospholipids whose polar headgroup shows a net negative electrical charge. Today it is known that ribotoxins constitute a broad family, produced by many types of fungi, with common characteristics that make them optimal candidates to be used for biotechnological purposes, such as pest control, and for the development of anti-cancer drugs in the form of immunotoxins.  Distribution  Ribotoxins have been detected in many different fungi, including entomopathogenic and edible species, but the three-dimensional structure has only been resolved for three of them: Œ±-sarcin, restrictocin, and hirsutellin A (HtA). The first two, produced by Aspergillus giganteus and Aspergillus restrictus, respectively, are nearly identical. HtA, produced by the entomopathogenic fungus Hirsutella thompsonii, is much smaller and only shows 25% sequence identity with the other larger ribotoxins. Even so, it retains all the functional characteristics of the family. A second ribotoxin similar to HtA, anisoplin, is known (70% sequence identity). It is produced by the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, another insect pathogen.  Structural features  All known ribotoxins are proteins of between 130 and 150 amino acids that share at least two different elements of ordered secondary structure: a Œ≤-sheet, where the active center is located, and a short Œ±-helix. The structural arrangement is very similar to that of other extracellular fungal RNases, which are not toxic, and constitute a family whose best known representative is the RNase T1 of Aspergillus oryzae. This explains why ribotoxins are considered the toxic representatives of the group. The observation of their three-dimensional structures reveals their functional differences in terms of toxicity, since ribotoxins present unordered, positively charged long loops, which are much shorter, and negatively charged, in their non-toxic \\"relatives\\". These ribotoxin bonds are responsible for recognition of both the negatively charged acid phospholipids that facilitate their entry into cells, and the ribosome- specific features that allow them to cause inactivation.  Enzymatic mechanism  Ribotoxins cleave RNA following a general acid-base mechanism shared by all the extracellular fungal RNases so far characterized, regardless of their toxicity. Using dinucleosides, such as GpA, it has been demonstrated that the breakage of the phosphodiester bond 3‚Ä≤-5‚Ä≤ of the substrate takes place through the formation of a cyclic intermediate that becomes the corresponding derivative 3‚Ä≤-monophosphate, the final product of the reaction. It is a transphosphorylation reaction, followed by the hydrolysis of this cyclic intermediate. For this reason, these proteins are knows as cyclant RNases.  Sarcin/ricin loop (SRL)  Ribotoxins specifically cut a single phosphodiester bond within the preserved sequence found in the sarcin/ricin loop (SRL). It is a segment of rRNA that adopts a loop structure. It is known as SRL precisely because it is the target of both Œ±-sarcin and ricin. Ricin is the best known representative of the ribosomal inactivating protein (RIP) family. RIPs are also highly specialized toxic proteins produced by plants and fungi that inactivate ribosomes acting as N-glycosidases. Its target is found in the same singular structure of the rRNA that is attacked by ribotoxins. They also depurinate a single nucleotide, contiguous to the phosphodiester bond that constitutes the target of the ribotoxins, producing the same inactivating effect of the ribosome. According to this criterion, ribotoxins are also RIPs. However, there is a fairly general consensus to use this name only for plant N-glycosidases, whereas the term ribotoxins refers only to toxic fungal RNases. In both cases, both ribotoxins and RIPs produce complete inactivation of the ribosome by causing the SRL loop to be unable to interact with the elongation factors of the translation. It has been precisely determined, using E. coli, that the binding of the elongation factor G (EF-G) is the most disturbed event by the catalytic action of these toxins. The positively charged ribotoxin surface allows them to establish favourable electrostatic interactions between the residues of their active site and the rRNA, explaining why they can carry out this highly specific recognition of the SRL.  Role of biological membranes  The toxicity of ribotoxins results from the combination of their specific catalytic activity and their ability to cross lipid membranes. Since no protein receptor has been found, the lipid composition of these membranes is a determining factor of their cytotoxic activity. Using phospholipid model systems it has been demonstrated that Œ±-sarcin is able to bind to lipid vesicles enriched in acid phospholipids, promoting their aggregation, leading to fusion, and altering their permeability. This allows the protein to be translocated through certain lipid bilayers in absence of any other protein. The outer leaflet of cancer cell membranes appears to be enriched with negatively charged phospholipids, which seems to explain the antitumor properties of ribotoxins.  Biological function in the wild  It is not clear why some fungi secrete ribotoxins. At least in the case of Aspergillus, it appears that they occur during the maturation of conidia, most likely as a defense mechanism against predators. The discovery that the entomopathogenic fungus Hirsutella thompsonii synthesized HtA, followed by the recent characterization of anisopline, suggests the possibility that ribotoxins behave as insecticidal proteins. This function has already been tested, using larvae from Galeria mellonella in laboratory experiments, for Œ±-sarcina and some other ribotoxins such as HtA itself.  Biotechnological and biomedical applications  The presumed insecticidal function of ribotoxins enables biotechnological possibilities to use them as a basis for the design of new, environmentally friendly bioinsecticides. In fact, extracts of H. thompsonii and M. anisopliae are marketed as pest control agents for different crops, although it is not yet known if their effect is due to the presence of ribotoxins. However, ribotoxins could be used, either independently or as part of bio-pesticide formulations, and this would be a more controlled and reproducible product than the complete fungal extract now in use. The potential toxicity of ribotoxins against vertebrates could be overcome by the design of new variants with reduced non-specific toxicity. Their combination with insect pathogenic viruses, such as some baculoviruses, represents another promising approach to this biological control. Natural baculoviruses are already used as effective biopesticides, but their genetic modification to supply ribotoxins could be an effective and safe alternative for pest control. Interest in ribotoxins has also been revived by the prospect of their use as components of antitumor immunotoxins. These immunotoxins are chimeric molecules composed of a fragment of a specific antibody, responsible for targeting a surface antigen present only in certain tumor cells, fused with a ribotoxin that promotes the death of the recognized cell. These immunotoxin designs based on the use of ribotoxins have been shown to be highly effective, although in laboratory experiments, with mice and tumour cells in culture. They have not yet been tested in humans. The additional benefit of not showing any detectable undesirable side effects, most likely due to the highly specific recognition of the antigen by the antibody used, makes them attractive for the therapeutic treatment of certain solid tumors. This approach has recently been improved with the incorporation of different artificial variants of ribotoxins, such as one that cannot cross the membranes on its own, but retains the ribosome inactivating activity, or a de-immunized version of Œ±-sarcin which, in vitro, has been proven incapable of triggering a T-lymphocyte response. Since the antibody fragment used is humanized, this last construction would then be practically invisible to the immune system, thus increasing the time window of its action.

He is most recognisable for the composition of a travelogue, in which he details his journey around the Mediterranean, travelling through Italy, Egypt, the Holy Land, and France. Biography Little is known about Bernard's life outside of the Itinerarium. The Frankish monk originated from the Champagne territory of France, later residing in the Monastery of Mont-Saint-Michel, located in the region of Brittany. Bernard is believed to have travelled sometime between the years 865 and 871. The Itinerarium Date The precise dates of Bernard's travels remain unclear, and is an issue which continues to be contested by historians. Some have claimed that Bernard travelled over a period of three years, from 867-870. The monk's acquirement of papal permission for his trip from Pope Nicholas I, who died in 867, has been deployed as evidence for the start year for Bernard's travels; the text's reference to the year 970 made by a tenth- century scribal editor, which has been deemed an error by exactly one hundred years, has been used to substantiate the claim for a three-year expedition. Leor Halevi suggests that there is no reason to believe that Bernard could not have travelled in the years preceding the Pope's death, however, positing the trip as having occurred anywhere between the years 865 and 871. Structure and content Bernard's Itinerarium is a ten-page tract logging the monk's journey around the Mediterranean. The text explores Bernard's travels throughout Italy, Egypt, the Holy Land and France. Accompanied by two monks, the Beneventan Theudemund and a Spaniard named Stephen, Bernard documents his encounters with sacred sites and different people, recording his impressions. Covering a vast number of regions and a distance of over 6000 kilometres, Bernard's journey allows for insight into Christian-Muslim relations in the ninth-century Mediterranean. In this respect, the tract is noteworthy for its production \\"at a time when hardly a Christian ventured willingly to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea\\". Halevi notes how the \\"account illustrates a largely unknown chapter in the history of the Christian encounter with Islam\\". On his trip from Italy to Alexandria, Bernard claims to have witnessed the transportation of ships containing 9000 Beneventan Christian slaves. In actuality, this number is likely an exaggeration, denounced by Michael McCormick as \\"manifestly impossible\\", and it can be inferred that the number was probably closer to 900. Bernard further notes the Venetians' removal of Saint Mark's body from the monastery of Saint Mark in Alexandria. The relative ease with which Bernard travelled to Arab-ruled Bari is noteworthy, given the dating of his travels to the period following the Arab raid against Rome. Towards the end of the text, Bernard attests to the peace which existed between Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem and Egypt, contrasting this to the volatile situation in Italy. To illustrate this point, Bernard claims that if, during his journey, his camel or donkey was to die, he would be able to leave his possessions unattended whilst visiting a different city to retrieve a new animal, and could return to find his belongings still there. Throughout the text, Bernard documents the challenges he faced whilst sojourning the Mediterranean, the majority of which are rooted in his attempts to gain access to different regions. Before beginning his journey, Bernard expresses his need to gain papal permission from Pope Nicholas I (a litterae formatae or commendaticiae). Whilst the monk achieves this with relative ease, he later notes having to gain letters from those such as the emir of Bari, Sawdan, to deliver to the leader of Alexandria, and a letter from the leader of Alexandria, to deliver to the ruler of Babylon (Old Cairo). It is in Old Cairo that Bernard details his six-day long imprisonment as a result of the ruler's distrust, reflective of this age as one of \\"mutual suspicions\\". Stages of the itinerary The main destinations visited by Bernard, in order, are as follows: # Rome # St. Michael cave shrine, Monte Gargano # Muslim emirate of Bari # T√°ranto # Port of Alexandria # Babylon of Egypt (Old Cairo) # Sitinuth (Menuph/Menouf?) # Maalla (El Mahalla El Kubra) # Damietta # Tanis # Ferama (Pelusium/Tell el-Farama) # Alariza (el-Arish) # Monastery of Saint George, Ramla # Fortress of Emmaus (Emmaus Nicopolis/Imwas) # Jerusalem # Valley of Jehoshaphat (upper Kidron Valley) # Mount of Olives # Sepulchre of Lazarus, Bethany (al-Eizariya) # Bethlehem # Monte Olevano (near Salerno) # Rome # Mont St-Michel Influences on Bernard Bernard makes explicit reference to his awareness of Bede's Ecclesiastical History, justifying his scarce discussion of the Holy Sepulchre as \\"Bede in his history says enough about it\\". The monk's description of Jerusalem is therefore notably brief, detailing a number of sacred sites and miracles which are afforded little more of a discussion than many of the other places Bernard visits.

Four of the five perpetrators were in the United States, illegally, three of these had been arrested multiple times.  Crime  On December 12, 2002 five young men surrounded a couple as they sat on a bench, grabbed the woman, dragged her down two staircases, down a path between two lethal third rails, and into their hideout, adjacent to Flushing Meadows- Corona Park, a subway line and a commuter rail line. The hideout was so well concealed that it took police searching with trained dogs two hours to locate it. It consisted of two areas, one \\"little more than a mattress and a refrigerator box,\\" the other a \\"piece of plywood leaning on a pole and draped with a deli awning\\" sheltering a mattress and sundry discarded objects. The man was left with a concussion and a broken nose. The woman was brutally raped repeatedly by the five perpetrators. The woman was badly beaten and the bone of her left eye socket was cracked.  Perpetrators  The five perpetrators were Carlos Rodriguez, 22, Victor Cruz, 22, Jose Hernandez, 18, Luis Carmona, 20, and Armando Juvenal, 20. Three of the perpetrators had police records. Hernandez, described as the ringleader by police, pled guilty to attempted third degree assault in 2000. He had grabbed a woman by the wrists and forced her to a building, pushed her into the basement and into a bedroom. The court granted the woman a protective order. The following month Hernandez and Juvenal were arrested and charged with threatening a woman with a steak knife. Juvenal allegedly said, I'm going to do something to you if you don't bring your brother to talk to us. Both men pled guilty to misdemeanor menacing and harassment charges. In 2002, Hernandez pled guilty top a July 9 assault on a man; he was sentenced to 90 days in jail. Juvenal had a record of minor violence. On March 11, 2001, he was one of about 20 men who chased two men into a restaurant, ordering them to give us everything you've got. He pled guilty to disorderly conduct. In 2000, he pled guilty to felony robbery in the mugging of a man for a watch and was sentenced to probation. Luis Carmona, the sole member of the gang who was in the United States legally, had previously been arrested \\"on charges of possessing stolen property, possessing marijuana, fare-beating and disorderly conduct.\\" Rodriguez and Juvenal are members of a criminal gang. New York Authorities did not notify the INS about any of the crimes prior to the 2002 rape.  Legal proceedings  Each of the five suspects plead guilty to reduced charges in exchange for lesser sentences. Accepting the pleas enabled the court to keep the name of the victim private. The victim attempted to sue the railroad for negligence in allowing the encampment to exist, but was denied on appeal.  Impact  In May 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg rescinded an executive order by Mayor Ed Koch that had blocked New York City police from reporting the immigration status of individuals who came in contact with the law to immigration authorities. He rescinded the order on September 17, 2003, replacing it with Executive Order 41 instructing city employees not to ask nor to disclose information about immigration status unless required by law or organizational mission.Executiveorder41 Senator Frank Padavan cited this crime as an argument for passing a bill in the New York State legislature requiring police department in New York to check the legal status of arrested persons.

The central ovoid of the galaxy was found to feature a bar-like structure and two arc structures that form a partial nuclear ring. Its emission is associated with the presence of HII regions. Around the nucleus lies a dusty ring-like structure, with a radius of 7 arcseconds, better seen at its northwest part. Another dusty ring is observed at 20 arcseconds radius.  Nucleus  Based on the emission lines that are present in its spectrum, the nucleus of NGC 2273 has been characterised as active and it has been categorised as a type II Seyfert galaxy. Also, a water kilomaser has been detected in the nuclear region of the galaxy. It could be created either by the active nucleus or by a prominent site of star formation. Observations by BeppoSAX, XMM Newton, and Chandra X-Ray Observatory suggested that the nucleus of NGC 2273 is obscured by a Compton thick column, with high column density, estimated to be cm‚àí2 as measured by ASCA, or cm‚àí2 as measured by Suzaku. The harder X-Rays manage to get through and are dominated by reflection from cold material, as the Fe-K line indicates. The spectrography of the nuclear regions is weakly polarised, more prominent in H-alpha. The broad X-ray spectrum of NGC 2273 has been found to be composed of a thermal or scattered soft component, a reflected component, and an absorbed power law component. The 2‚Äì10 keV X-ray flux of the galaxy is estimated to be ergs‚àí1. The nucleus also emits radiowaves. The radio source has been found to be linear and is composed of two unequal radio features separated by about 170 parsecs. These two radio features have been identified as radio jets. A linear jet-like feature extending for 2 arcseconds east of the nucleus was observed in [O III] Œª5007 images. It is aligned with the radio jets and is possibly of nuclear origin. The most accepted theory for the energy source of active galactic nuclei is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the black hole in the centre of NGC 2273 is estimated to be between based on kinematics of the water maser circumnuclear disk. The disk appears warped.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 2273 is the brightest galaxy in a galaxy group known as the NGC 2273 group. Other members of the group include the galaxies NGC 2237B and UGC 3504. NGC 2237B lies 40 arcminutes to the south.

Composer In 1715, at the age of fifty-five, Scarlatti was at the height of his career and creativity, with extraordinary fertility in all the vocal genres of his time. Yet, he called himself a \\"glory in decline\\" (letter to Ferdinando de' Medici). If he chose to write a collection of twelve instrumental works, it was perhaps with a view to publication. He also composed toccatas and variations for the keyboard, an ensemble of six Concerti grossi (published in London in 1740), as well as seven sonatas for flute, two violins and continuo, dated the year of his death. \\"Sinfonie\\" The twelve Sinfonie of 1715, which are part of this series of instrumental works, are preserved in a single manuscript, now in London. It bears the following words: cominciate al Po Giuno 1715 (begun on June 1, 1715) On the other hand, no completion date is indicated. The orchestra also includes a viola, like a desire to cover the sound spectrum of the large orchestra. Each Sinfonia also includes a cello part distinct from the continuo. The title appears only on the header of the first Sinfonia. The second is entitled Concertata con li ripieni, but the others have no title. Four are real concertos grossos with another solo instrument in addition to the recorder: a second flute (Nos.1 and 5), one trumpet (No. 2), one oboe (No.4) while eight are concertos for solo recorder, where the instrument shines especially in slow movements and joins the tutti in fast movements, each bringing its own colours to the ensemble's texture. All the Sinfonie are in five movements, except for Nos. 4 and 9. The 4th is deprived of a fast introductory movement and the 9th is added a minuet. The first movement is fast and usually ends on the dominant. The second is an Adagio transition, usually to a time. The third is a fugue (sometimes with two themes), generally the most accomplished movement. This is followed by another transition Adagio, which leads to a rapid dance movement or a march that concludes the composition. The last Sinfonia is the only one with a title, \\"The Genius\\", which means \\"the charming, the brilliant\\" or most probably \\"the favorite\\" like the concerto RV277 by Vivaldi.

It was created by Moses Jacob Ezekiel, a B'nai B'rith member and the first American Jewish sculptor to gain international prominence. The statue was high, of marble, and the plinth (base) added another . It weighed , and was said to be the largest sculpture created in the 19th century. It was carved in Italy and shipped to Fairmount Park in Philadelphia for the nation's 1876 Centennial Exposition. It was later moved to Independence Mall and now (2019) stands in front of the National Museum of American Jewish History. Sculpture of Religious Liberty by Moses Jacob Ezekiel, Philadelphia, 1876 The meaning of the sculpture > It comprises four figures, the principal one representing the Goddess of > Liberty, dressed in coat of mail and a mantle, with a shield, having the > American flag in relief on her breast. The Phrygian cap on he[r] head is > bordered in front with thirteen stars of solid gold. Her right hand rests > upon the fasces, the scroll of the constitution and wreath of laurel; her > left is extended in gesture, waving off all interference. Under her > protecting right arm stands Faith, symbolized by a nude boy, whose head and > right hand are raised appealingly to heaven, and whose left hand holds close > to Liberty's breast a vessel in which is burning the undying flame of > Religion. At the feet of the Goddess, on her left, is Intolerance, > represented by a monstrous serpent, part of the body of which is coiled > around the fasces, while its head protrudes with gaping jaws from under the > garment of Liberty. With outstretched wings, fierce bearing and its talons > buried in the neck of the serpent, is the American eagle. Creation of the sculpture In his Memoirs, Ezekiel described how the block of marble occupied two freight cars, and took twenty men \\"several days\\" to move it from the railway station to his studio, the iron chain of a derrick having snapped. \\"A great deal of street paving\\" was necessary afterwards, to repair the damage. He had to knock down part of a wall to get it in his studio, and break it down again to get it out. When it was completed, which took two teams of stonecutters, one working during the day and one at night, for one day he invited the Roman public to see it. He wrote that it made him famous overnight; one newspaper said that it \\"was perhaps the most important work of art that had been produced in centuries.\\" It led to Ezekiel's introduction to Giuseppe Garibaldi. Financial problems The commission was for $20,000 (). According to Ezekiel, before obtaining the marble a letter from B'nai Brith informed him that they were unable to raise the money to pay him, and he should abandon the project. Nevertheless, having created the clay model, and this being the first ever Jewish commission for a sculpture, with a guaranteed place at the Centennial Exposition, he decided to continue work. He had to borrow money to pay for its transportation to Philadelphia himself. He did not receive payment until three years afterward, and when the loans and interest had been paid there was nothing left for him. Documents concerning the commission are held in the B'nai B'rith archives. A program from the ceremonial unveiling is held by the National Museum of American Jewish History.

He served as president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine from 1965 to 1997. He also served in the Eastern Front of World War II, and was a hotel manager. He received the Order of the Patriotic War, and is credited with building ice hockey infrastructure and programs, and is referred to as the father of ice hockey in Ukraine. His career in hockey was recognized with induction into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2006. Early life Khorozov was born on 25 June 1925, in Korsun- Shevchenkivskyi, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. He graduated from the Odessa Higher Engineering Marine School in an electromechanics program. He participated in the Eastern Front of World War II, and was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War of the first degree. Hockey career Khorozov served as president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine, and its forerunner federation from 1965 to 1997. He became involved in ice hockey by organizing a team at his son's school. He was introduced to Dmitry Boginov in 1963, who was the first coach of the new Dynamo Sports Club hockey team, which later became Sokil Kyiv. Boginov invited Khorozov into the national hockey workings, and Khorozov became president of the federation in 1965. Khorozov focused on creating schools across Ukraine to teach hockey, and recruited reputable coaches to develop skills. He secured funding from the State Committee for Construction in the 1970s and led the construction of ice hockey rinks for youths. He also negotiated support from the trade unions in Ukraine to sponsor teams at all ages to play in the new rinks. He was aided by political friends including Vitaliy Masol and Vitold Fokin, and fought to increase wages for successful players, and aimed to reduced their housing costs. Players referred to Khorozov as a \\"public president\\" in the sense that he was approachable by all, and wanted to include and encourage everyone. Khorozov championed the cause of youth being healthy both physically and spiritually. He brought in strong competition for teams in Ukraine by using his contacts in Russia. By the middle 1980s, local-grown talent began to mature, and play on Sokil Kyiv and the Soviet Union national ice hockey team. By 1985, Sokil Kyiv won the bronze medal in the Soviet Championship League, and became one of the more popular teams in the Soviet Union. This success led Khorozov to assist in the development of sports tourism, and the Olympic training center in Koncha- Zaspa. Khorozov was succeeded as president of the Ice Hockey Federation of Ukraine by Oleksandr Omelchenko. In a 2006 interview, Khorozov said that choosing Omelchenko as his successor was a mistake, since state funding for hockey was ended, and its development structure was abandoned. Personal life Khorozov was seriously injured during the war, but later played football, tennis, and enjoyed water skiing. Despite his work in promoting ice hockey, he never played the sport, and was a hotel manager in his professional career. He died on 27 September 2011, in Kyiv, Ukraine. Honors Khorozov was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame as a builder in 2006. The announcement was made during the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Riga, and on 11 May 2006, he became the first Ukrainian in the IIHF Hall of Fame, and as of 2019 is the only representative from his country. Khorozov is referred to as the father of ice hockey in Ukraine, and was made an honorary president of the Ukrainian Ice Hockey Federation.

The Teekloof Formation is the uppermost formation of Adelaide Subgroup deposits West of 24¬∫E and contains Middle to Late Permian-aged (Guadalupian to Lopingian) deposits and four biozones (Pristerognathus, Tropidostoma, Cistecephalus, and Daptocephalus assemblage zones) of the Beaufort Group.Keyser, A.

The Teekloof Formation does not underlie other units other than the younger Karoo dolerites and sills that relate to the emplacement of the Early Jurassic Drakensberg Group to the east.Kitching, J. W. (1970). A short review of the Beaufort zoning in South Africa. In Second Gondwana Symposium Proceedings and Papers (Vol. 1, pp. 309-312). Outcrops and exposures of the Teekloof Formation range from Sutherland through the mountain escarpments between Fraserburg and Beaufort West. The northernmost localities of the Teekloof Formation are found by Loxton, Victoria West and Richmond.Rubidge, B. S. (ed.) 1995b. Biostratigraphy of the Beaufort Group (Karoo Supergroup). South African Committee of Stratigraphy. Biostratigraphic Series 1. Pretoria, Council for Geoscience.  Geology  The Teekloof Formation overlies the Abrahamskraal Formation and is not capped by any other preserved sedimentation. Only East of 24¬∫E does the preservation of Beaufort Group rocks continue. There is no rock preservation in the western-southwestern portions of the Karoo Basin. It is unclear whether rock preservation there ceased in the Late Permian due to localized basinal tectonics, or if that rock material was preserved but later weathered away. The Teekloof Formation has five subdivisions or members which are listed below (from oldest to youngest): * Poortjie Member - Correlates with the Pristerognathus Assemblage Zone * Hoedemaker Member - Correlates with the Tropidostoma Assemblage Zone * Oukloof Member - Correlates with the Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone * Steenkampsvlakte Member - Correlates with the Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone * Javanerskop Member - Correlates with the Daptocephalus Assemblage Zone  Lithologies  The sedimentary rocks of this formation are predominantly reddish or minor green mudstones that are either structureless, horizontally laminated, or medium to thickly bedded. Pedogenic and diagenetic carbonate nodules and also fossil gypsum rosettes occur in the mudstone deposits. Interbedded with the mudstone deposits are minor channel sandstones ranging from pale olive to greenish-grey in colour. The sandstones are fine to medium grained and preserve fining-upward sequences (e.g. from bottom to top: Massive, horizontally laminated, trough cross- bedded, and ripple cross-laminated sedimentary structures). In the uppermost sections of the Teekloof Formation, the Javanerskop Member contains ribbon- shaped, single storied sandstones. These sandstones in the uppermost sections contain numerous erosional surfaces lined with siltstone or mudstone pellet conglomerates. Geologists consider the Teekloof Formation depositional environment to have been a floodplain facies association that underwent seasonal arid conditions and playa lake formation as indicated by the presence of fossil gypsum rosettes and carbonate nodules. The sandstone occurrences preserve evidence of deposition on point bars in a meandering river system. Seasonal waning flood level events are indicated by the fining upward sequences.  Paleontology  The Teekloof Formation is rich in fossil material and is particularly renowned for its diverse therapsid fossil fauna. Plant and invertebrate trace fossils are also found as are some preserved vertebrate fossil trackways. Well-known trackways of the pareiasaur Bradysaurus, and therapsids Diictodon and Tapinocaninus have been found by the town Fraserburg.

She was honoured with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta for her services to mathematical education. Life Izabela Abramowicz was born in 1889 in Lutos≈Çawice, Poland (then a satellite of the Russian empire), to Tomasz Franciszek Abramowicz, a school teacher, and Maria Petronela (n√©e Gniotek). She had two brothers, Kazimierz (who would also become a mathematician) and Zygmunt. Abramowicz graduated from the State Gymnasium in Bobrujsk in 1907. She attended the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at the Saint Vladimir University in Kiev, obtaining an undergraduate degree with a gold medal for her thesis On double integrals on algebraic surfaces. Her dissertation supervisor was Boris Yakovlevich Bukreev. She received consent from the Minister of Education to remain at the university without a stipend to prepare for her master's degree, the requirements for which she had almost fulfilled in 1918. In 1923, she moved to ≈Åƒôczyca, near Pozna≈Ñ, where she stayed till the Second World War. During the German occupation of Poland, between 1942 and 1944, she was arrested and made to work at various factories in Pozna≈Ñ and Lubo≈Ñ. After the war, she returned to Pozna≈Ñ. Abramowicz died on 22 January 1973, and was interred at the parish church in Wiry. Career Between 1917‚Äì1920, Abramowicz was a docent at the Polish University College in Kiev. This had been set up in 1916 to teach humanities, but expanded later to allow mathematics and the sciences. Its faculty comprised Polish academics teaching at Russian universities. Abramowicz was one of two women in the faculty. She also taught in three local gymnasiums. In 1923, Abramowicz started work as a math teacher at the State Junior High School in Wolsztyn. In the years 1924‚Äì1939 she was a teacher of mathematics at the General Zamoyski State Gymnasium in Pozna≈Ñ. Abramowicz was a member of the Polish Scientific Society in Kiev. She attended three mathematical conferences: the 1st Polish Mathematical Congress in Lviv (1927), the 1st Congress of Mathematicians of Slavic Countries in Warsaw (1929) and the 2nd Polish Mathematical Congress in Vilnius (1931). Following the end of the war, she taught mathematics at the Zamoyski State Gymnasium till 1953, after which she worked at the Adam Mickiewicz High School, retiring in 1968. For her services to education, Abramowicz was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.

She is known for her results in continuum theory, especially on Jordanian continuums. Life Stanis≈Çawa Dorota Liliental was born in Warsaw to Regina Lilientalowa, an ethnographer, and Nathan Liliental. Stanis≈Çawa had a younger brother, Antoni (born 1908). She attended Helena Sk≈Çodowska-Szalay's primary school, and went to Warsaw's private school for women for 7 years. She joined the Warsaw University in 1916, reading mathematics under Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Zygmunt Janiszewski, and Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski She married Otto M. Nikodym, a mathematician, in 1924, and joined him at Krakow. Supervised by Mazurkiewicz, she was awarded a doctoral degree from the Jagiellonian University in 1925. She was the first woman in Poland to obtain a PhD in mathematics. Receiving government funding to study in Paris, she and Otto attended the Sorbonne for two years from 1926. In 1930, they returned to Warsaw. She took up a job at the Warsaw Polytechnic, working with Franciszek Leja till 1936, when he left for Krakow. Her brother, Antoni, a chemist and officer in the Polish army, was murdered during the Katyn Massacre in 1940. Under the Nazi occupation of Poland, unnecessary occupations, including higher education, were suppressed. The Nikodyms conducted clandestine classes in mathematics despite the danger of punishment. In 1944's Warsaw Uprising, she and her husband lost their possessions, including several unpublished mathematical works. They moved to Belgium for a congress of mathematicians in 1946, and Otto gave lectures in various European cities, before they emigrated to the United States, settling in Gambier, Ohio. After her husband's death in 1974, she donated their papers and her paintings to the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas, Austin. Stanis≈Çawa Nikodym died in Warsaw in 1988. Career Mathematics While on leave from university in 1918‚Äì1919, Stanis≈Çawa taught mathematics to soldiers in the Polish army. Her doctoral thesis was titled On disconnecting the plane by connected sets and continua. She published three books and several articles before the Second World War broke out. Among her findings were necessary and sufficient conditions for a subcontinuum of a Jordanian continuum to be Jordanian. She also established that if the intersection and union of two closed sets are Jordanian continua, then so are the sets themselves. In the 1940s, she taught mathematics at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where her husband was also a member of the faculty. Art As a student, Liliental participated in open-air painting in Sandomierz. She painted the cityscape several times in watercolour over many years in the inter-war period from 1922. The resulting works were presented at an exhibition in 1933, after which she donated them to the District Museum in Sandomierz, where they remain to this day.

E. Miner Professor of Economics at University of Oregon. He is also a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a Research Fellow at IZA, and a Research Affiliate at the University of Chicago Crime Lab. He has contributed to the scientific study of cannabis and alcohol policy, as well as crime and labor economics.  Education and career  Benjamin Hansen received his B.A. in Economics from Brigham Young University in 2004, his masters in economics from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2005 and PhD in economics from University of California, Santa Barbara in 2009. He has also worked with the University of Chicago Crime Lab as a Research Affiliate.  Research and academic work  Hansen has published over a dozen articles in peer reviewed academic journals since graduating with his PhD in 2009. These articles have primarily focused on alcohol policy, cigarette policy, cannabis policy, and policing. His work on cannabis policy, in particular, was some of the first studies using natural experiments to investigate the causal impact that medical marijuana legislation had on other types of risky behavior such as drunk driving. Hansen along with D. Mark Anderson and Daniel Rees found that the availability of medical marijuana in a state was apparently associated with a causal reduction in alcohol-related driving and fatalities, suggesting that individuals had been previously using alcohol for self medication. In addition, this suggested that cannabis policy had unintended positive effects due to its substitutability for other types of worse forms of risky behaviors. He, again along with Anderson and Rees found little evidence that marijuana availability from medical marijuana legislation was resulting in increases in adolescent use, suggesting that it was possible for prohibition to be relaxed without spilling over to vulnerable populations. Much of Hansen's work relates to all forms of risky behaviors, including as mentioned alcohol policy. In an article published in the American Economic Review, Hansen studied the causal effect of driving while intoxicated (DWI) arrests, proxied by blood alcohol content of 0.08 or greater, had on rearrest using a regression discontinuity strategy. He found evidence that stiffer penalties for DWI could in effect reduce rearrest, thus suggesting that alcohol use (or at least, DWIs) were somewhat sensitive to increased penalty, providing one of the few pieces of evidence in support of such a hypothesis. Hansen has also studied race-based statistical discrimination among prisoner re-entry programs, like ban the box. Former prisoners in many cities must inform potential employers during the job application phase whether they have ever been arrested or convicted. Evidence suggests that these kinds of questions pose major hurdles for prisoners as they attempt to re-enter the labor market. As a result, many states and cities, as well as the federal government, prohibit firms including such questions on applications, requiring such information to be collected later in the application process. Jennifer Doleac and Hansen found that ban-the-box has the unintended effect of introducing statistical discrimination among potential employers. Lacking information on an applicant's criminal background, many employers appear to simply guess at the background using demographic averages, notably race and gender. Doleac and Hansen found strong evidence that the law, while well intentioned, may be reducing employment opportunities among young, low-skilled, black males. Finally, consistent with his work on alcohol deterrence, Hansen and Gregory DeAngelo produced one of the only studies finding that police are capable of deterrence among drivers through the issuing of speeding tickets. The authors used a natural experiment where the size of the police population shrank as a result of state budgetary constraints. The subsequent decrease in police force resulted in a reduction in police enforcement which caused a statistically significant increase in injuries and highway fatalities. The authors estimated that a single highway fatality can be prevented with approximately $300,000 expenditures on state police.

He also has a M.Sc. from the same institution. He subsequently won a French Government Scholarship to France, where he earned a Certificate in French Language and Civilization from the University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1985. In 1986 he also earned the Dipl√¥me (equivalent to an M.Phil.) in international economics from the Institut International d‚ÄôAdministration Public (IIAP), the international wing and sister institution of the prestigious √âcole nationale d'administration (ENA) of France. Mailafia later proceeded to the United Kingdom as a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Scholar at Oriel College, earning a DPhil from the University of Oxford in 1995.  Career  Mailafia began his career teaching Government and Economics at Akoko Anglican Grammar School, Arigidi-Ikare in Ondo State, Nigeria between 1978 and 1979 as part of his primary assignment during his obligatory National Youth Service Corps year. After national service he returned to his old alma mater, Ahmadu Bello University, as a Graduate Assistant in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences from 1980 to 1982. During this period he lectured undergraduates and was also Research Assistant to Professor Ibrahim Gambari, who later became Foreign Minister and subsequently United Nations adviser for Political Affairs. From 1982 to 1989, Mailafia was a Fellow and sometime Acting Research Director of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS). He was on the team that prepared a special report on Local Government Reforms during 1982‚Äì1983. He also co- authored a report on the Maitatsine Religious Riots that formed the bedrock of the government's response to the crisis (1984). In collaboration with Professors Adedotun Phillips and Eghosa Osagie, he prepared several technical papers advising the Nigerian government on economic policy and macroeconomic reforms. He served on a committee that advised the Federal Military Government on a peaceful approach to the Nigeria-Cameroon Bakassi Peninsula Dispute. It helped in avoiding a catastrophic war between the two neighboring countries. At the National Institute he came under the mentorship of illustrious Nigerians who have spurred his interests in public service: Chief Simeon Adebo, Pius Okigbo, Eme Awa, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, Gidado Idris, Akinola Aguda, Moshood Kashimawo Abiola and Claude Ake. From 1990 to 1995, Mailafia was resident tutor and lecturer in the economics and politics of developing areas at Plater College Oxford at the time an associate college of the University of Oxford.

He was subsequently a lecturer in international finance at Richmond Business School, the American International University in London (1997‚Äì1998). He was then headhunted as the pioneer head of the International Business Department of Regents Business School London (1998‚Äì2000). From 2001 to 2005, Mailafia served as a chief economist in the Strategic Planning and Budgeting Department of the African Development Bank Group. He served both in Abidjan and in Tunis when the bank was temporarily relocated to Tunisia. In this capacity he was on several missions throughout Africa to supervise projects in power and infrastructures, agriculture industry. He was also the task manager for coordinating grants to research institutions throughout Africa, including such institutions as the Council for Social Science Research (CODESRIA), African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) and the African Capacity Development Foundation (ACBF). He drafted the Concept Note that was later adopted by the board of the AFDB, leading to the establishment of New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and was also a Member of the AfDB and the United Nations Economic Commission of Africa (UNECA) Joint Committee that provided technical support to the steering committee of the heads of state and government on the establishment of NEPAD and its secretariat. Mailafia was secretary to the senior management committee and special negotiating team for the Ninth Replenishment of the African Development Fund and a member of the task force for the joint management of the HIPC Trust Fund, in coordination with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF. From 2005 to 2007, Mailafia was recalled home from the African Development Bank to serve as deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). In this capacity he served a member of the board of directors of the bank and was principally responsible for managing monetary policy, economic policy, research and statistics and liaison with regional and international bodies, including the IMF and the World Bank. He was a principal actor in the banking consolidation exercise of 2005‚Äì2006 that led to the reform of the Nigerian banking sector. He oversaw the reduction of the number of commercial banks, through mergers and acquisitions, from 89 to 25 consolidated banks; an exercise that was widely regarded as one of the most successful such efforts anywhere in the developing world in recent times. He was also an active participant in the negotiations that led to Nigeria negotiating its way out of the Paris Club group of indebted nations. From 2010 to 2015, Mailafia was the chief of staff (Chef de Cabinet) to the 79-member nation African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States based in Brussels, Belgium.
