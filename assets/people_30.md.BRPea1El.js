Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Isabel was built as a private yacht in 1917 by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine for automobile manufacturer John North Willys of Toledo, Ohio. Willys had intended for the yacht to have qualities that would make her desirable for use by the U.S. Navy, and had contacted the Navy about the possibility of selling her into naval service. The Navy initially was uninterested. However, after the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, the Navy decided to buy Isabel, which it viewed as being not only highly suitable for use as a patrol vessel but also having characteristics similar to those of a destroyer. The Navy therefore acquired her in 1917 prior to completion, converted to Navy use as a destroyer, gave her the patrol vessel designation SP-521,Although classified as a destroyer, her hull number was that of a section patrol vessel. and commissioned her as USS Isabel at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, on 28 December 1917 with Lieutenant Commander Harry E. Shoemaker in command. Service in World War I Isabel departed on 28 January 1918Cressman, p. 60, places the date at 29 January 1918 for France via Bermuda and the Azores. She reached Brest, France, on 20 February 1918 to begin convoy escort duties. While performing coastal convoy duty, she fought German submarines on four occasions. The first time was on 18 March 1918, when at 10:50 hours, while proceeding westward and escorting stores ship USS Rappahannock (AF-6) and transport USS President Grant (ID-3014), she and destroyer USS Reid (DD-21) spotted a German submarineCressman, p. 60, says the submarine was UC-55, but Gr√∂ner, Erich, German Warships 1815‚Äì1945 Volume Two: U-Boats and Mine Warfare Vessels, Annapolis, Maryland:Naval Institute Press, 1991, , p. 33, says that UC-55 was sunk in September 1917. U-55 (see Gr√∂ner, ppp 26 & 28) and UB-55 (see Gr√∂ner, p. 9), however, both were in commission in March 1918, and, given her English Channel operating area, UB-55 is likely the submarine to which Cressman is referring. off Penmarc'h, France. Reid fired on the submarine and dropped two depth charges, while Isabel dropped one depth charge. Although the two ships were credited with sinking the submarine, evidence gathered later indicated that the submarine had escaped. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Shoemaker, received the Navy Cross \\"for distinguished service... as commanding officer of... Isabel, engaged in the important, exacting and hazardous duty of transporting and escorting troops and supplies through waters infested with enemy submarines and mines.\\" He was relieved by Lieutenant Lewis W. Comstock on 24 July 1918. Isabel continued protecting convoys carrying troops and supplies to France until the end of the war and departed France on 16 December 1918. Post-World War I service 1919‚Äì1920 USS Isabel (SP-521) making smoke ca. 1919. (The photograph has also been identified as showing her on the Yangtze River in 1921). Arriving at Boston, Massachusetts, on 2 January 1919, Isabel remained inactive at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until 25 April 1919, when she was ordered to Key West, Florida, to report to the commanding officer of submarine USS K-5 (SS-36) for duty as a tender to ships on the Mississippi River. Departing Key West on 14 May 1919, Isabel steamed up the Mississippi to St. Louis, Missouri, stopping at every major port on the river along the way to perform recruiting duties for the Navy. Returning to New Orleans, Louisiana, on 20 August 1919, Isabel was soon underway for Rockaway Beach, Long Island, New York, for duty as a tender for the famous flying boats of the NC-4 flotilla. Reporting 18 September 1919, she cruised the United States East Coast with the aircraft from Maine to Florida before returning to Rockaway Beach on 4 January 1920. Isabel decommissioned at Philadelphia 30 April 1920. Out of commission 1920‚Äì1921 While Isabel was out of commission, her classification was changed from \\"destroyer\\" to \\"patrol yacht\\", and, under the Navy's new alphanumeric hull classification system instituted in 1920, her designation changed from SP-521 to PY-10 on 20 July 1920. Meanwhile, the Navy considered how best to employ her in the future. One idea was to convert her into a seaplane tender to support the NC flying boats; another was to send her to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire to replace the gunboat USS Scorpion (PY-3) as station ship there. In the end, it was decided to send her to the Far East and employ her on the Yangtze Patrol. Two of her 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) single-purpose guns were removed and replaced by two 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) 23-caliber antiaircraft guns. The Yangtze Patrol 1921‚Äì1928 Recommissioning at Philadelphia on 18 July 1921, Isabel departed for the Far East on 21 August 1921 to join the Yangtze Patrol on the Yangtze River. Transiting the Panama Canal, she arrived at Hong Kong on 7 November 1921. She became flagship of the patrols commander, Rear Admiral William H. G. Bullard. She was further modified at Cavite Navy Yard in Cavite, Luzon, the Philippines, having a deckhouse installed aft. During the tumultuous years that followed in China, Isabel served as a member of the patrol and as its flagship, charged with protecting American commerce from pirates. Based at Shanghai, Isabel spent the low-water period on the river at Hankow, returning to the coast in the summer. She and the other small gunboats of the U.S. Navy in China performed the arduous task of protecting American interests during numerous incidents and threats to American nationals. On many occasions the ship came under fire, as in October 1926 when she was caught between the rifle fire of opposing Chinese armies on the Yangtze. Isabel also took part in the Nanking Incident on 24 March 1927, when shelling and threats of force procured the release of a large group of American and British prisoners held by Chinese nationalists in Nanking. She patrolled the 1,700 nautical miles (3,148 kilometers) of this dangerous river until 1928, when enough purpose-built river gunboats had arrived to serve in the Yangtze Patrol that she was no longer needed on the river. She then joined the Asiatic Fleet. Asiatic Fleet duty 1928‚Äì1941 Her aft deckhouse removed, Isabel spent 1928 through 1941 with the Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines and China, much of the time at Manila as \\"relief flagship\\" for the fleet commander. In the 1933‚Äì1934 gunnery year, she finished first among patrol vessels mounting 3-inch (76.2-millimeter) 50-caliber guns. In December 1941, as the threat of war with Japan grew ever larger, Isabel was given a secret mission by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to make a reconnaissance of the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina. Personally briefed on the plan by Asiatic Fleet commander Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Isabels commanding officer, Lieutenant John W. Payne Jr., took her to sea on 3 December 1941, with all excess topside weight removed and her motorboat replaced by a pulling whaleboat, heavily fueled and provisioned, carrying additional life rafts, and with all of her codebooks except for one prearranged cipher left ashore. She left Manila under a cover story that she was searching for a PBY Catalina flying boat missing off the Indochinese coast. Payne was under orders to approach the coast under the cover of darkness, showing lights that would mislead observers to think that she was a fishing vessel, and report on Japanese ship movements; if forced to fight, he was to fight back as best he could and try to escape, but, if necessary, to destroy Isabel rather than allow the Japanese to capture her. Isabel first sighted another ship on 5 December 1941, when she encountered a large, dark- gray ship flying no flag and apparently altering course frequently to try to move out of sighting range. On the morning of 6 December 1941, a Japanese Aichi E13A1 \\"Jake\\" reconnaissance floatplane from the seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru circled Isabel at an altitude of 1,000 feet (305 meters) and a range of 2,000 yards (1,830 meters). She was in sight of Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, later that day when she was ordered to return to Manila. While she was on her return voyage, she received word on 8 December 1941 (which was 7 December 1941 in the United States and at Hawaii), of the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the beginning of U.S. participation in World War II. World War II service USS Isabel (PY-10) in the Southwest Pacific in 1942.Isabels first wartime duty was to escort U.S. Navy submarines through the minefields off Corregidor as they sortied from Manila Bay to defend the Philippines. She was at Cavite Navy Yard when Japanese aircraft made a devastating attack on the base on 10 December 1941. Eight bombs, all duds, ringed Isabels fantail. She shot down one of the attackers. That evening Isabel and two destroyers escorted the submarine tenders and with the just relieved Commander of Submarines south to Borneo in order to set up an alternate command. For the next month Isabel operated as an antisubmarine escort for convoys in the East Indies, as outnumbered American, British, Australian, and Dutch forces tried desperately to oppose the Japanese offensive. She underwent air raids at Batavia on Java, Palembang on Sumatra, and Tjilatap on Java, escaping from several ports only days ahead of invading Japanese forces. On 20 January 1942 the ship was part of the covering force at Ratai Bay on the Sunda Strait during the transfer of 3,456 personnel from the liner , considered too valuable to risk within enemy land based air range, to smaller vessels for onward transport to Singapore.Other ships in the covering force were , , , , , , , and . On the way back from a convoy assignment on 7 February 1942, Isabel was sent to rescue survivors from the Dutch merchant ship Van Cloon, which had been sunk by torpedoes and gunfire from a Japanese submarine, near Surabaya, Java. As Isabel picked up 187 survivors of Van Cloon, the Japanese submarine which had sunk Van Cloon, probably I-55, fired a torpedo at Isabel and surfaced nearby. The torpedo missed, and Isabel quickly drove the submarine down with gunfire and assisted a patrolling Dutch Catalina flying boat in dropping depth charges to drive it from the area. By the time all ships were ordered to leave Java strong Japanese forces under Admirals Kond≈ç and Nagumo were operating south between the islands and Auratralia. Isabel was among the last American ships to leave Java before the island fell to the Japanese and avoided the fate of other ships, including an entire four ship convoy and its escort , transiting the Japanese operating area and arrived in Australia on 7 March 1942 after seeing gunboat USS Asheville (PG-21) sunk during numerous Japanese air raids on the ships south of Java during the voyage to Australia.A useful map diagram is on page 630 in Gill's Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945 (navy) volume 1 showing ships sunk and fleeing Australian naval vessels. Based at Fremantle in Western Australia, Isabel took up new duties as escort and training ship for the U.S. Navy submarines now also based there, serving as a target for submarines practicing torpedo approaches. She also helped train allied submarines. Isabel remained on this duty until 27 August 1945, twelve days after hostilities with Japan ceased. Isabel received one battle star for World War II service. Post-World War II service Isabel had been considered for post-war service as flagship for the Philippine Sea Frontier, but the United States Seventh Fleet commander deemed her to be in too poor condition for such use. Instead, she departed Fremantle on 27 August 1945 and Australia entirely on 5 September 1945, headed for the United States. She called at Port Moresby, New Guinea; Manus Island; Majuro; Johnston Island; and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on the voyage home. Isabel arrived at San Francisco, California on 26 October 1945. Decommissioning and disposal A month later, a Navy inspection team deemed Isabel to be in such poor condition that she should be decommissioned, towed to sea, and sunk. She was decommissioned on 11 February 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 26 February 1946, but rather than being sunk, she was sold for scrap on 2 March 1946. Scrapping began on 25 March 1946.

Born in Pueblo, Colorado, Hyman graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1924. He first served in battleship , and in the years before World War II, was assigned to many ships and a variety of shore stations, including the Office of Naval Operations. He assumed command of destroyer 6 October 1941. After convoy escort duty in the Atlantic, Sims moved to the Pacific in early 1942. In May, as the Japanese attempted to extend their conquest to Port Moresby, the ship was operating with oiler in a fueling group for Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's aircraft carriers. While the carrier fleets maneuvered for position, Japanese planes found Neosho and Sims in the Coral Sea; and, thinking they were carrier and escort, attacked in strength. After Lt. Comdr. Hyman fought his ship through 2 air raids with great skill, 36 Japanese planes attacked the 2 ships. Sims took three 500-lb. bomb hits in this third attack. From the time the first bomb that hit the Sim's had exploded to the time she was sunk was a total of 48 seconds, leaving only 13 survivors. The sacrifice of his ship and Neosho had much to do with saving the Navy's carriers in the widely separated engagements known as the Battle of the Coral Sea. The Japanese blunder in mistaking the Sims for a cruiser and the flat top Neosho as an American carrier, diverted much needed air power and other resources from the Battle of Midway, just a few days away. As the Sims was sinking, with all but the forward 5\\" gun submerged, the Sims continued to fire her gun even though the gun crew knew they were about to die. The actions of Commander Hyman and his crew were upholding the finest traditions of the U.S. Navy. Lieutenant Commander Hyman received the Navy Cross for his heroic service. USS Hyman (DD-732) was named for him.

History The history of the 95.9 MHz frequency in the Green Bay area dates back to the mid-1980s, with WJLW. Locally owned by Jack LeDuc (from whom the \\"JL\\" of the call letters originated), WJLW broadcast a country music format until October 1995, when LeDuc sold the station to Woodward Communications. (LeDuc would resurrect the WJLW call letters, and its country format, one year later at the 106.7 frequency in Green Bay.) The 95.9 frequency went dormant for a month until November 13, 1995, when Woodward launched WKSZ as \\"95.9 Kiss FM.\\" The station was positioned as a Top 40/CHR, putting it in direct competition with Midwest Communications' heritage CHR, WIXX. Kiss FM's ratings managed to hold steady in the middle of the Arbitron ratings for the Green Bay market, thanks to the long-time dominance of WIXX as the premier hit radio station in Northeast Wisconsin. However, a ratings surge by WKSZ in 2001-2002 had the station beating WIXX in several key younger demographics. In response, Midwest Communications changed the format of their low-rated adult contemporary station, WLTM, to a rhythmic format as WLYD, \\"Wild 99.7.\\" On April 18, 2003, after a stellar first book performance by \\"Wild\\", Woodward pulled the plug on \\"95.9 Kiss FM.\\" A local research project commissioned by Woodward indicated a format \\"hole\\" for hot adult contemporary, and after a weekend of stunting with Christmas music, Woodward launched the new format on WKSZ as \\"Today's Best Variety, Mix 95.9\\" on April 21. The first (and what would later be the last) song on \\"Mix\\" was \\"Why Georgia\\" by John Mayer.http://northpine.com/broadcast/archive/news0403.html The move to hot AC, however, backfired for Woodward, as Mix 95.9's listener share sank to at or near the bottom of the Arbitron ratings in the Green Bay market. In February 2006, Midwest Communications dropped WLYD's rhythmic format in favor of variety hits (as WZBY). One month later, on March 13, at 10 a.m., Woodward would fill the void \\"Wild 99.7\\" left behind, flipping WKSZ from Hot AC back to \\"Kiss FM\\", mixing Kiss' contemporary hit music with some rhythmic music formerly heard on \\"Wild.\\" The first song on the revived \\"Kiss\\" was \\"In Da Club\\" by 50 Cent (which was also the last song on the first incarnation of \\"Kiss\\"). Mix Flips to Kiss FM in Appleton- Oshkoshhttp://northpine.com/broadcast/archive/news0306.html (Reviving the \\"Kiss FM\\" moniker was an acknowledgment that listeners still referred to WKSZ by that name, even during its \\"Mix\\" days.) A noticeable addition to \\"Kiss-FM\\" after its return has been the \\"tagging\\" of each song (artist and song title) at its conclusion, regardless of whether a DJ will be heard afterwards. The 2006 return of Kiss paid off, for in the first Arbitron ratings book after the flip (spring 2006), WKSZ leaped to a fourth-place ranking (of 21 stations) with an audience share that was five times greater than the share \\"Mix 95.9\\" pulled in during its waning days. The station finished second place in the most recent (fall 2010) Arbitron ratings for the Green Bay market. On February 15, 2016, WKSZ started simulcasting on sister station WKZY (92.9 FM), which formerly repeated sister station WKZG. The move was done to expand WKSZ's reach to the Fox Valley, as well as southern areas of the market. In addition, Doug Erickson and Mary Love, who were WKSZ's morning hosts from November 2004 until December 2012 (when they moved to WKZG upon that station's launch), returned to host mornings on WKSZ. WKSZ Adding Appleton Simulcast; Doug & Mary to Return They remained until September 2017, when they were let go and replaced with former WIXX personalities Jake Kelly and Tanner Jay, who returned to Green Bay after two years at WKTI-FM in Milwaukee. The WKSZ call letters were first used in the Philadelphia market at 100.3 FM (now WRNB) before being relocated to WJLW in 1995.

Indigenous people have been using various components of native Australian flora, and some fauna, as medicine for thousands of years, and many still turn to healers in their communities to dispense medicines and spiritual healing. Some of these traditional methods have underwritten non-Indigenous medicines, such as a medicine for seasickness during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Today, traditional healers and medicines have been incorporated into modern clinical settings to help treat sick Indigenous people within some healthcare networks.  Overview  Traditional medicine has been defined as the sum of the total knowledge, skills and practices based on the theories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health, as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. Bush medicine is also connected to the holistic worldview in such a way that the interplay between the physical, emotional, social and spiritual aspects is crucial in attaining wellbeing. The modern world and Aboriginal culture have differing approaches for health. Whilst conventional medicine deals with direct causes of illness and science-based views of health, the Aboriginal view on health as defined by the National Aboriginal Health Strategy considers \\"not just the physical well being of the individual, but the social, emotional and cultural well-being of the whole community. This is the whole-of-life view and it also includes the cyclical concept of life-death-life\\".National Aboriginal Health Strategy (NAHS) Working Party (1989) National Aboriginal Health Strategy Report Canberra: Department of Affairs Broadly, most human societies see the manifestation of illness as natural, human or supernatural. According to Patrick Maher, the traditional Aboriginal model of illness sees social and spiritual dysfunction as a cause of illness, while supernatural intervention is regarded as the main cause of serious illness. PDF Aboriginal concepts of illness and pain and its causes are quite different from western medicine; for example, a severe headache may be attributed to an evil spirit having taken up residence in the head. It is also believed that damage to sacred sites associated with Dreamtime mythology may cause serious illness. The basic structures and more complex systems of belief need to be understood before the role of bush medicine or traditional healers can be grasped. Generally, bush medicine in Australia is made from plant materials, such as bark, leaves and seeds, although animal products were used as well. A major component of traditional medicine is herbal medicine, which is the use of natural plant substances to treat or prevent illness. Aboriginal remedies vary among the many Aboriginal groups in different parts of the country. There is no single set of Aboriginal medicines and remedies, just as there is no single Aboriginal language.  Remedies  Herbal medicine is a major component of traditional medicine. The Aboriginal people view E. alternifolia, a plant considered by some Australians as an invasive weed, as a valued medicinal plant and some carry the leaves with them. They use it to treat symptoms of the common cold and flu, with some also viewing it as a cure. Other plants used in bush medicine includes the leaves of the emu bush, which some Northern Territory Aboriginal people used to sterilise sores and cuts. It could also be gargled when necessary. The stinging nettle has also been used in some Aboriginal bush medicine to treat paralysis and rheumatism.Top 10 Aboriginal bush medicines, Australian Geographic, 8 February 2011 Mitchell Park, now within Cattai National Park and situated near Sydney Basin in NSW, had many plants that were used as remedies for Aboriginal people.Wohlmuth, H. (1997). Bush medicines of Western Sydney. Australian Journal of Medical Herbalism, 9(2), 50-3. Nine species of eucalyptus present in the park could act as remedies. The red gum kino is known to be rich in astringent tannins.Low, T (1990) Bush Medicine: A pharmacopoeia of natural remedies Sydney: Angus & Robertson Additionally, this park also contained native pants that were actually used by early European settlers. The nectar-laden liquid from banksia flowers was used as a cough syrup, and from the native grapes (Cissus hypoglauca) a throat gargle was made. The use of animals and other living things may also be used in bush medicine. In Warrabri, Northern Territory, one cure for earache is squeezing the fatty part of a witchetty grub into the sore ear. In Uluru, the cure involves squeezing rabbit urine into the ear. Healers Aboriginal people believe that their healers, their \\"medicine men\\", have special powers which are bestowed upon them by their spiritual ancestors to heal. They have the roles of both a general practitioner and a psychiatrist, healing both the body and mind. For the A·πâangu of the Western Desert cultural bloc, practitioners of bush medicine are known as ngangkari. They cure illnesses through healing rituals that may involve magic. An example of such ritual would be singing, massaging and sucking to remove a foreign object that has entered the body, and invoking the power of the war god Ancestor Ngurunderi to heal the wounds of soldiers caused by spears and clubs. Aside from physical healing, ngangkaris also act as mental health practitioners, as they try to resolve conflicts within the community and offer advice as well. With every sickness, in addition to giving a diagnosis and advice on suitable remedies, the duty of the ngangkari is also to assess the impact of the sickness to the community. Many Aboriginal people choose to be treated by bush medicine instead of, or as well as, Western treatments for a number of reasons. These include: some Aboriginal people feel uncomfortable and out of place in a sterilised, Western clinic; Aboriginal bush medicine incorporates physical, spiritual and emotional healing, whereas Western medicine does not; and they believe that by using these treatments they are being drawn closer to their ancestors. Modern and non-Indigenous use 20th century use A medicine developed by Aboriginal peoples of the eastern states of Australia, from the soft corkwood tree, or Duboisia myoporoides, was used by the Allies in World War II to stop soldiers getting seasick when they sailed across the English Channel on their way to liberate France and defeat Hitler during the Invasion of Normandy. It had been flown over to Europe and developed in great secrecy by Canadian researchers, before the \\"mystery pill\\" was dispensed to every participating soldier for the massive military operation, which was pivotal to winning the war but had been delayed several times because of seasickness. Later, it was found that the same medicine could be used in the production of the tropane alkaloid drugs, scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which are useful for eye surgery, and a multi- million dollar industry was built in Queensland based on this substance. As a bush medicine, the substance was or is used by various Aboriginal groups for catching fish, as part of ceremonies, and as a sleeping potion, among other uses. A 1969 study reported that variety of bush medicine techniques were still being used. In Western Australia and the Northern Territory, eucalypt kino (gum) was drunk for influenza, colds and coughs.Webb LJ. 1969. The use of plant medicines and poisons by Australian Aborigines. Mankind 7: 137-46. A 1994 survey reported that 22% of the 15,000 Aboriginal people from all over Australia in the sample had practised bush medicine in the previous six months. 21st century use Traditions in southern and eastern Australia have largely been lost, but efforts are being made by anthropologists to record traditions from Aboriginal people in central and north-western Australia. In the Northern Territory, however, it is still relatively well- preserved. Ngangkaris are said to be present in health clinics to perform rituals and give medical advice when necessary. The use of bush medicine and natural remedies in Australia has declined, partly due to the loss of information. In Aboriginal culture they do not pass on information through writing, but through singing and dancing ceremonies, which are becoming far rarer. Without these ceremonies, the tens of thousands of years of knowledge that the Aboriginal elders hold can be lost. In 2019, the Northern Adelaide Local Health Network developed the first formalised, clinically endorsed mechanism to support ngangkaris working in accessed in acute, rehab, and palliative care inhospitals including Lyell McEwin and Modbury hospitals, as well as other units, including mental health facilities. Traditional healing methods used include Pampuni (healing touch), Mapampa (blowing), and Marali (spiritual healing and bush medicines) to complement mainstream treatment.

Boghos Nubar (), also known as Boghos Nubar Pasha () (2 August 1851 ‚Äì 25 June 1930), was a chairman of the Armenian National Delegation,The New Armenia, Volumes 11-12, The New Armenia Pub. Co., 1919, page 63 and the founder, alongside ten other Armenian national movement leaders, of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) on April 15, 1906, becoming its first ever president, a position he held from 1906 to 1928. In 1912, he was appointed by Catholicos Gevorg V to head the Armenian National Delegation.  Early life  Nubar was born in Constantinople in 1851. His father was Egyptian Prime Minister Nubar Pasha.  Career  Nubar fought for the Armenian cause.By Joan George \\"Merchants in Exile: The Armenians of Manchester, England, 1835-1935\\" page 184 As early as the beginning of 1912 the Catholicos of Mother See of Echmiazin Gevork V had sent the Boghos Nubar to the Cabinets of Europe with a commission to demand administrative autonomy for Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. He has also been considered as one of the prominent Armenian figures in the Ottoman Empire.Title: Memories of a Turkish statesman-1913-1919, Publisher George H. Doran Company, 1922, page 246 This proceeding was a step for Russian and French policy in Constantinople almost at the same moment on March 15, 1913. Boghos Nubar, the ambassador, repeatedly asserts that the Armenians of Ottoman Empire in no way desire to bring up the question of independence or constitutional changes (regarding Armenian National Constitution). Their sole aim is to secure the reforms drawn up by Russia France and England and provided for in the Treaty of Berlin reforms which have remained a dead letter hitherto. In February 1914, the Armenian reform package passed. In January, 1919, The Times published a letter from Boghos Nubar (an Ottoman citizen) in which he protests, belatedly, about the non-representation of Armenians at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.

Burgess's music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the early 1980s as co-founder and co-lead singer of the synthpop band Landscape, which released a top 10 hit in 1981 with the single \\"Einstein a Go-Go\\". Burgess is one of the main composers of Landscape's music, and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. After the band's break-up, he pursued a brief, moderately successful solo career releasing one mini-album, Richard James Burgess in 1984. He launched his career as a producer with Spandau Ballet's debut UK hit \\"To Cut a Long Story Short\\", the first commercial success for the hitherto underground New Romantic movement. Burgess currently serves as the CEO of A2IM: American Association of Independent Music. Early years Richard Burgess was born in London, England, and his family emigrated to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1959. He showed an early interest in music, especially drums, and bought his first drum set at the age of 14. As a drummer, he gained experience in local bands including Fred Henry, Orange, Easy Street, The Lordships and Barry Saunders. Burgess also showed an early interest in recording production, buying a portable Tandberg tape recorder when he was sixteen to make amateur recordings. Burgess studied electronics at college before turning to studies in music. In 1972, he left New Zealand to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston, and in 1973 moved back to London to study at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He holds a PhD in musicology from the University of Glamorgan (now the University of South Wales). Career Musician and recording artist In the mid-1970s, Burgess was a member of the soft rock band Easy Street, together with Ken Nicol and Peter Marsh. The trio released two albums, Easy Street (1976) and Under the Glass (1977) and several singles, one of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100 (\\"I've Been Lovin' You\\"). From 1975 through the early 1980s, Burgess co-produced, co-wrote, programmed, sang and played drums for the electronic band Landscape with Christopher Heaton, Andy Pask, Peter Thoms and John Walters. The band's RCA Records album From the Tea-rooms of Mars... To the Hell-holes of Uranus yielded the international hits \\"Einstein a Go-Go\\" and \\"Norman Bates\\". As a Capitol Records solo artist, he charted singles on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart, reaching No. 1 on the New York Dance Music Report chart. Burgess has played on many albums as a studio-drummer and percussionist, having worked with producers such as Tony Visconti, Peter Collins, Trevor Horn, Ian Levine, Robin Millar, Hugh Padgham, Mike Stone, Gary Langan, Barry Mason, Peter Dawkins, John Sinclair, Gary Lyons, and Junior Campbell. These include albums such as Adam Ant's Strip and The Buggles' The Age of Plastic. He also recorded jazz with the British National Youth Jazz Orchestra, Neil Ardley, Ian Carr and Nucleus, and the early Landscape recordings. He performed live with Graham Collier, OBE. Producer In the early 1980s, Burgess emerged as the first producer of the New Romantic movement, producing Spandau Ballet's first two gold albums and first seven charting singles. He won a Music Week magazine sales award as a producer, and has created twenty-four chart singles and fourteen charting albums. Other productions included recordings for Adam Ant, King, New Edition, Melba Moore, Colonel Abrams, America, Kim Wilde, Five Star, Tony Banks and Fish. He was also an ambient pioneer in producing the British group Praise. He produced, engineered and mixed albums by Rubicon and X-CNN under the pseudonym Caleb Kadesh and did several mixes using the pseudonym Cadillac Jack. He was co- producer, co-executive producer, project manager and an author for Jazz: The Smithsonian Anthology and is credited as associate producer on Tony Trischka's Territory and as a compiler of Classic Piano Blues for Smithsonian Folkways Recordings. Burgess's mixes and remixes include tracks for 9¬Ω Weeks, About Last Night and artists Thomas Dolby, Lou Reed, Youssou N'Dour, and Luba. Innovator Burgess defined the computer programmer's and sampler's role in modern music via his work in the 1970s, creating the first computer driven hit, \\"Einstein a Go-Go\\", using the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer. He is believed to be the first to record digital samples on a commercial recording with his programming of the Fairlight CMI on Kate Bush's Never for Ever album and Visage's single \\"Fade to Grey\\". He conceptualised and co-designed the first standalone electronic drum set, the hexagonal shaped Simmons SDS-V. He appeared on three separate occasions on the BBC Television program Tomorrow's World demonstrating his prototype of the SDSV, the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, and the Fairlight CMI. He coined the name for the New Romantic movement of the early 1980s, as well as the term \\"electronic dance music\\" (EDM) in which it first appeared on the record sleeves of the 1980 Landscape single \\"European Man\\". His New York City productions of Colonel Abrams' gold singles \\"Trapped\\" and \\"I'm Not Gonna Let You\\" are widely considered to have been the precursors to house music, with \\"Trapped\\" referred to as a proto-house track and a precursor to garage house. Educator and academic Burgess is a member of the academic advisory committee for The Association for the Study of the Art of Record Production (ASARP, London College of Music). He has lectured on the subject of record production and the music business in the United States and in the United Kingdom. He wrote and presented the BBC World Service radio series Let There Be Drums. He taught drums at the Annapolis Music School in Maryland, and has taught classes on record production and the music business at The Omega Studios' School of Applied Recording Arts And Sciences. Author Burgess' book The Art of Music Production: The Theory and Practice, which was in 1994 originally entitled The Art of Record Production, is now in its fourth edition. In 2014 he published his second book, The History of Music Production. He has written many chapters for other books and articles for technical and music magazines, as well as articles, papers and interviews for the academic Journal on the Association Art of Record Production (JARP), for which he is joint editor-in-chief. Manager and executive In 1978, Burgess founded a management company, Heisenberg Ltd, which managed producers and engineers such as Phill Brown, Andy Jackson and Rafe McKenna in the UK and US. The company changed its name to Burgess World Co in the mid-eighties, and relocated to Maryland from Los Angeles and New York in the mid-nineties where it managed many mid-Atlantic based artists including Jimmie's Chicken Shack. From 2001 through 2015, Burgess was employed at Smithsonian Folkways Recordings where he was the Associate Director of Business Strategies. Committees Burgess has been a member of the national steering committee for the Recording Academy's Producer and Engineer Wing and has served as co-chair of the executive committee for Smithsonian Music, a pan-institutional music initiative. He served as Vice-President of the Washington, D.C. Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and co-chair for both the DC Chapter of the Producer and Engineer Wing, and the national Producer Compensation Committee.  Non-profit work  Burgess is the current CEO of the American Association of Independent Music.

He originally appeared in Monster Nation and later Frostbite. He is a Captain in the Colorado Army National Guard. He is notable for having appeared in Frostbite though the two are apparently different fictional universes (he apparently died in Monster Nation), and for the \\"Bannerman Lives\\" campaign by a group of Wellington fans.  Monster Nation  Monster Nation tells of the American military response to the early weeks of a zombie apocalypse. Clarke is called in to assess the emerging crisis. He is instrumental in bringing Nilla, the story's other main protagonist, face-to-face with the source of the zombie plague. In the process, he suffers a presumably mortal injury, impaled on the wreckage of a downed helicopter. His death, however, is never made explicit; the chapter ends with a zombie closing in on the immobilized Clarke, who wonders if he will be able to dispatch the creature (a former friend) before dying himself. The openness of this ending is responsible for the \\"Bannerman Lives\\" campaign among some Wellington fans.  Frostbite  In contrast to Monster Nation, Clarke is only a minor character in Frostbite, acting as a support character to the protagonist, his niece, Cheyenne. That this is a separate fictional universe is apparent, as the world in Frostbite has not suffered the zombie plague of the Monster trilogy.  Personality  Clarke is portrayed in both stories as a dedicated and disciplined military officer. He is also shown to be a man of honor, with a genuine belief in the duty of the strong to protect the weak (and of those who can become strong to do so). Before being convinced of the nature of the zombie plague, he is sickened at the idea that he was ordering soldiers to fire on what he believed to be civilians who were merely sick.  The \\"Bannerman Lives!\\" Campaign  Due to the popularity of the Bannerman Clarke character among readers of Monster Island, and the implicit nature of his apparent death, several Wellington fans began to express hopes of his survival in the comments of the online serialization of it and its sequel, Monster Planet. This became a meme among some Wellington fans, and hope eventually became partly replaced by dogged insistence‚Äîin spite of Wellington's own indications that, yes, Clarke was indeed dead. Over time, and especially after the opening of Wellington's Hail Horrors! discussion forum, this meme seems to have taken on two main forms of expression. The first is the simple insertion of \\"Bannerman Lives!\\" and similar slogans in posts. The second is continued discussion of how exactly Bannerman Clarke will figure into any ongoing Wellington work, as if it were a foregone conclusion that such would happen, even if it has already been determined that the story exists in an entirely separate fictional universe. This continued even after, in Monster Planet, Nilla discovered a zombie in military uniform impaled on the wreckage of a crashed helicopter in the location of Bannerman's fatal crash‚Äîclearly Bannerman, and explicitly stated as such by Wellington. The subsequent appearance of the character in Frostbite was taken by many as vindication of their faith.

Dealers also vary in the type of material they handle, ranging from a general stock to highly specialised firms who only trade in particular countries or topical areas. Stamp catalogues Herbert L'Estrange Ewen's Catalogue of Postage and Telegraph Stamps..., 4th edition 1895. Stamp catalogues principally evolved from stamp dealer's price lists, though today most stamp catalogues no longer represent a retail price list. The Stanley Gibbons catalogue is an exception that, in principle, still shows the price at which they would sell a particular stamp over the counter at their London shop, or by mail order, if they had it in stock and it was in the exact condition outlined in the notes at the start of the catalogue. In practice, many items are not in stock, or are not in the same condition, or the price at which the stamp is for sale differs for some other reason from that shown in the catalogue. The Gibbons catalogue was originally published as a penny price list in November 1865.Phillips, Stanley.

Size of the market  Unlike some other markets, such as stocks and shares, the majority of transactions in the philatelic or stamp market take place informally, by mail order or in retail environments, and therefore the size of the market is difficult to determine.

Crosby and Rinker began performing together in 1925 and were recruited by Paul Whiteman in late 1926. Pianist/singer/songwriter Barris joined the team in 1927. They made a number of recordings with the Whiteman Orchestra and released singles in their own right with Barris on piano. They appeared with the Whiteman orchestra in the film King of Jazz (Universal Pictures, 1930), in which they sang \\"Mississippi Mud\\", \\"So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together\\", \\"A Bench in the Park\\", and \\"Happy Feet\\". They are best remembered for launching Crosby's solo career, one that would make him the greatest song charting act in history and one of the most influential entertainers of the twentieth century. Beginnings Al Rinker's high school band called the Musicaladers (musical aiders) had to let go of their drummer. Coincidentally, Crosby had bought a set of drums and learned to play. Rinker learned about Crosby and that he was pretty good and Crosby joined the band. They had mixed success and Crosby was slowly finding less interest in becoming a lawyer, his original career path. They drove Rinker's Model T to Los Angeles where Rinker's sister, Mildred Bailey, a locally known jazz singer, was working. Shortly after their arrival, they landed a gig on the vaudeville circuit, as a vocal act. Crosby and Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea, a short revue put out by the Fanchon and Marco agency, and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively and individual style and they were particularly popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al obtained work in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. Their skills were further honed during their time with Morrissey and when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, they blossomed. Some members of Paul Whiteman's Orchestra caught their act and recommended them to him. Whiteman hired them in October 1926. While waiting to join Whiteman's Orchestra they made their first record \\"I've Got the Girl\\" with Don Clark's Orchestra (a former member of Whiteman's Orchestra) at The Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles (506 South Grand Ave.). Bing and Al then joined the Whiteman Orchestra in Chicago, where they made their first records with Whiteman. At that time, it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up the musical selections he was presenting and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement admirably. After less than a year in full- time show business, they had become part of one of the biggest names in the entertainment world. Reception and time with Whiteman The Rhythm Boys performing \\"So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together\\" in King of Jazz Initial successes with Whiteman were followed by disaster when they reached New York as they could not be heard in the large Paramount Theater. However, the addition of Harry Barris made all the difference to the act and Paul Whiteman's Rhythm Boys were born. The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success. The trio sang in three-part harmony with both Rinker and Barris playing the piano. Barris wrote a song called \\"Mississippi Mud\\" in 1927. They recorded it the same year as a medley with \\"I Left My Sugar Standing in the Rain\\" without the orchestra. The Whiteman Orchestra later recorded a hit version featuring Bix Beiderbecke on cornet and Irene Taylor singing along with the Rhythm Boys. A year touring with Whiteman provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone. Much has been written about the escapades of the three men during this period and clearly, they were living life to the full. Despite all of this, Crosby was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer. He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio. An offer to go out on his own was, however, refused by Crosby and he stayed faithful to the Rhythm Boys. Paul Whiteman Orchestra - Motion Picture, June 1930 Whiteman had decided to re-employ the trio because he had signed up with Old Gold Cigarettes to deliver a weekly hour-long show on Tuesdays nights over CBS from station WABC in New York. The Old Gold people especially requested the presence of Crosby and the Rhythm Boys on the show and Whiteman reemployed them at $900 per week. The Old Gold Radio Hour had its first broadcast on February 5, 1929, and the Rhythm Boys appeared every week until April 15, 1930. The famous trip to Hollywood in mid-1929 aboard the Whiteman Old Gold Special followed their return to Whiteman and Crosby started to become noticed in Hollywood. Early screen tests were unsuccessful but the Rhythm Boys carved out a reputation as they starred at the Montmartre Cafe for several weeks. The delays in filming King of Jazz led Whiteman and the Rhythm Boys to return to the east coast for a while, but then they all returned to California at the end of October 1929 to finally begin filming. Around this time, Crosby was jailed following a car crash as he had been drinking and he lost a solo spot in King of Jazz to John Boles. The Rhythm Boys did, however, have a couple of featured spots in the film and Crosby also sang over the opening titles. Last performances and break-up After completing filming, Whiteman took his troupe up the West Coast to Seattle prior to returning east for the New York premiere of King of Jazz. However, the lure of his girlfriend, Dixie, and of the sunshine in California proved too strong for Crosby, so he and the Rhythm Boys left Whiteman in Portland, Oregon in April 1930, and returned to Los Angeles. (A year or two later, Whiteman formed another group called Paul Whiteman's Rhythm Boys which had Ray Kulz, Jimmy Noel and George MacDonald as the vocalists. They were soon augmented by the deeper voice of Al Dary and this enhanced group also recorded \\"Mississippi Mud\\" (Victor 36199) which caused confusion among collectors.) Although some books indicate that the original Rhythm Boys act then went into the Montmartre, there may be confusion with their earlier appearance there in 1929. They did appear on local radio and sing for film soundtracks, but it was not until they went into the Cocoanut Grove at the Ambassador Hotel in July 1930 ‚Äúthat the action picked up a little,‚Äù to quote Crosby. Singing with the Gus Arnheim Orchestra, Crosby's solos began to steal the show, while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. They recorded one song, Them There Eyes, with Arnheim's Orchestra for RCA Victor in November 1930.Notes to The Chronological Bing Crosby Volume 8 1930-31 Jonzo Records JZCD-8. They appeared in the 1931 film Confessions of a Co-Ed where they sang Ya Got Love and Crosby sang Out of Nowhere. Radio broadcasts over station KNX from the Cocoanut Grove made Crosby famous on the West Coast, but his drinking problems and risky behaviors caused him to start missing performances and his pay was docked. The trio failed to turn up for their scheduled appearance at the Cocoanut Grove on Saturday, May 16, 1931, and it became clear that they had walked out on their contract. They stated that their six-month contract had expired but they did not know or had forgotten that a nine-month option existed. Apparently, a more lucrative contract was in prospect at the Roosevelt Hotel. Crosby described what happened in his book \\"Call Me Lucky\\". > \\"Toward the end of our engagement at the Grove we didn‚Äôt take our > responsibilities seriously enough to suit Abe Frank. Frank was running the > Cocoanut Grove and The Ambassador Hotel. But the Grove was his pet. He was > an elderly, serious sort who disliked anything that disrupted the even tenor > of the nightly routine at the Grove. When people were supposed to appear, he > expected them to be on deck. So, when I failed to get back for the Tuesday- > night show once too often, he docked my wages. Of course, Abe was within his > rights legalistically speaking, but I thought he was pretty small about it, > so I quit. I was encouraged in this defiance by an offer from Mack Sennett > to make a series of movie shorts for him. I had made one for him already, > and working in pictures looked like easy money to me. I made a couple more > shorts at Sennett‚Äôs, then Abe Frank plastered a union ban on me, ‚Äúfor > failure to fulfill the standard musician‚Äôs contract.‚Äù After that, union > musicians weren‚Äôt allowed to work with me.\\" Rinker commented on the situation too. \\"By that time the drive was gone from the Rhythm Boys. We were each developing different interests. Harry was writing songs. Bing was playing golf. I was becoming interested in the production end of the business. We felt the Rhythm Boys was a stage in our lives and now it was over. The Rhythm Boys broke up and went their separate ways. Crosby's solo career took off after the break-up and the union ban was lifted. Crosby went on to become the biggest entertainer of the twentieth century.

Like all Quiscalus grackles, it is a rather large, gregarious bird. It lives largely in heavily settled areas. It is also known as the 'kling-kling' and 'chinchil√≠n' in the Dominican Republic, and as a ‚Äòchango‚Äô in Puerto Rico. Taxonomy The Irish physician, naturalist and collector Hans Sloane stayed in Jamaica between 1687 and 1689. During his visit, he collected specimens and made notes on the plants and animals. Based on these notes, the ornithologist John Ray published a short description of the Greater Antillean grackle in 1713, using the Latin name Monedula tota nigra but it was not until 1725, more than 35 years after his visit, that Sloane himself published a description of the grackle. He reported that it was common on the road between St. Jago de la Vega (Spanish Town) and Passage-Fort (Portmore). In 1775 the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon described the Greater Antillean grackle in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand- coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Oriolus niger in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. Buffon's specimen was probably collected in the French colony of Saint-Domingue which occupied the western end of Haiti. In 1921 the American ornithologist James L. Peters restricted the type locality to Port-au-Prince in Haiti. The Greater Antillean grackle is now one of seven species placed in the genus Quiscalus (six extant and one extinct), that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The genus name is from the specific name Gracula quiscula coined by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus for the common grackle; the specific niger is Latin for \\"black\\". There are seven subspecies, each restricted to one island or island group. They differ from the nominate subspecies (Q. n. niger) in size, bill size, and colour tone. * Q. n. caribaeus ‚Äì (Todd, 1916): found in western Cuba and on the Isla de Juventud * Q. n. gundlachii ‚Äì Cassin, 1867: found in central and eastern Cuba * Q. n. caymanensis ‚Äì Cory, 1886: found on Grand Cayman Island * Q. n. bangsi ‚Äì (Peters, JL, 1921): found on Little Cayman Island * Q. n. crassirostris ‚Äì Swainson, 1838: found in Jamaica * Q. n. niger ‚Äì (Boddaert, 1783): the nominate subspecies, found on Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) * Q. n. brachypterus ‚Äì Cassin, 1867: found in Puerto Rico Description The -long male is glossy black with a large rudder-like tail; the -long female has a smaller tail and is similar in color, but less glossy than the male. The eye is yellow and is the only non-black body part. The Greater Antillean grackle is a generalist eater; it eats fruits, bread, plant matter, and both small vertebrates and invertebrates alike.

Kennedy, from 1994‚Äì2005. Teeter died in Conchitas, Mexico of advanced lymphoma. Teeter signed on as Sirhan's lawyer in 1994 and repeatedly tried to get a retrial for his client in order to clear his name. However, he was unsuccessful in doing so right up to his death. Besides Sirhan's case, Teeter also handled other cases, without charging a fee for many of them. In 1982, Teeter unsuccessfully defended Norma Jean Almodovar from a three-year state prison term for pandering, arguing that the 1982 law specifying the sentence was unconstitutional, an argument that was refused by the California 2nd District Court of Appeal. In 2002, he helped a group submit legal opposition to a planned redesign of Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl. However, the redesign proceeded and the Bowl was reopened in 2004.

The show aired on NBC from 1973 to 1982 and featured many prominent guests, including John Lennon (in his last televised interview), Paul McCartney, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic (in his first televised appearance), Ayn Rand, Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, Public Image Ltd, Ken Kesey, Charles Manson, The Clash, KISS, Ramones, and U2 (in their first American television appearance). Los Angeles news anchor Kelly Lange, a colleague of Snyder, was the regular substitute guest host. History and format overview In fall 1973 NBC's decision to launch a nightly program after the Tonight Show was prompted by the 1970 Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act which banned tobacco advertising on television, resulting in a loss of revenue for the network. The thinking was that extending the broadcast day by one hour could help recover some of that income.Tom Snyder on Later, 1994 NBC had begun programming the 1:00 a.m. time slot on early Saturdays (late Fridays) with The Midnight Special, which began regular airings (initially brokered) eight months before Tomorrow launched; the success of The Midnight Special was a likely factor in expanding programming in the time slot to five days a week. Debut Established as more of an intimate talk show, Tomorrow differed from Tonight and later late- night fare, with host Tom Snyder conducting one-on-one interviews sans audience, cigarette in hand, alternating between asking hard-hitting questions and offering personal observations that made the interview closer to a genuine conversation. Making the show work financially became a challenge for NBC due to extremely low prices for commercial spots that a program at 1 a.m. could command. Since, according to Snyder, a 30-second spot on the show brought in only US$3,000, the network's primary concern initially was cutting production and distribution costs. As satellite transmission was only used for rare special events at the time (the seminal Aloha from Hawaii had just unveiled the technology earlier in 1973), the show was sent from coast to coast over the terrestrial microwave facilities (also used for long-distance telephone calls as well as broadcast video & audio at the time) of AT&T; Long Lines and it reportedly took NBC the entire first year of Tomorrow broadcasting before they succeeded in getting lower usage tariffs from AT&T.; Unique and often revealing one-on-one exchanges were the program's staple. As Johnny Carson had mostly abandoned the highbrow, intellectual guests that were common on The Tonight Show in its early years (especially during Jack Paar's hosting run), and during the show's run from New York, many of those types of guests ended up on Tomorrow. Notable interviews included those with author Harlan Ellison, actor and writer Sterling Hayden and novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand. A one-on- one program with David Brenner as the sole guest revealed that Snyder and Brenner worked together on several documentaries. In a 1979 interview the author and activist James Baldwin explained why he first left the country to live in Europe. The John Lennon interview On 28 April 1975, Tomorrow aired what eventually became its most talked about and enduring moment: John Lennon appeared in what would turn out to be his final televised interview. Since at the time Lennon faced deportation proceedings from America over his 1968 misdemeanor conviction for cannabis possession in London, after the first part of the interview during which Snyder covered the regular topics, Lennon's legal representative - immigration attorney Leon Wildes - joined Lennon on the panel to discuss the details of the case, as the famous musician directed his message at the American public in an appeal of sorts to be allowed to remain in the United States. Following Lennon's murder on 8 December 1980, the interview was replayed in its entirety the next night on Tomorrow, and soon even released on home video where it became a cult favorite. Introducing the five-year-old interview about to be replayed, Snyder referred to it as \\"not terrific, not terribly entertaining or enlightening, containing no historical information or anything new, but having little bits of stuff and substance of a man who was part of change, a revolution if you will, in popular music during the 1960s\\".Tomorrow Coast to Coast;9 December 1980 Asked about the Lennon interview years later, Snyder reiterated that it was not a great one in his view and that it would have long since lapsed into obscurity had Lennon not been shot.Snyder on Later with Bob Costas Saturday Night Live and Dan Aykroyd's impersonation of Snyder NBC occasionally used Tomorrow to plug various holes in its late-night schedule. Snyder did a special Saturday show with Jerry Lewis as the only guest on 4 October 1975 because a new program meant to premiere that evening was not ready to launch. Lewis was interviewed for one hour and fifteen minutes, before Snyder brought out the \\"Not Ready for Primetime Players\\" (Gilda Radner, Laraine Newman, Jane Curtin, Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Garrett Morris, and John Belushi) for the last fifteen minutes of the show so that the national audience could meet the debut cast of the network's new sketch series Saturday Night (the Live would not be appended to the title until 1977). When not grilling guests, Snyder would often joke around with off-stage crewmen, often breaking out in the distinctively hearty laugh that was the basis of Dan Aykroyd's impersonation of Snyder on Saturday Night Live, which the comedian first did in April 1976. Snyder's seemingly mismatched jet black eyebrows and grey hair were also lampooned on SNL. Being the subject of SNL satire greatly raised Snyder's profile; many viewers knew the impression before knowing the man's own work. (After Aykroyd's departure in 1979, Joe Piscopo took over the Snyder impersonation.) Snyder was, as well, the inspiration for the cartoon \\"Tom Morrow\\", which appeared in Playboy in the late 1970s. Snyder would let his flamboyant side take over from time to time such as a 1978 show when he had on one of NBC's West Coast staff announcers, Donald Rickles, one day after interviewing the same-named comedian Don Rickles. During the course of their segment, Snyder and Rickles (the announcer) spent ten minutes playing the then-new electronic game, Simon. By the late 1970s, Tomorrow was already in danger of cancellation. Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels was in the process of developing a replacement ‚Äî ironically named Yesterday ‚Äî that would have roughly followed the format of SNL‚Äôs Weekend Update; it never made it to air. Tomorrow's guests supplied the program with plenty of bizarre moments such as an August 1979 appearance by 24-year-old Chicago shock-jock Steve Dahl who gained a measure of national attention earlier that summer for taking part in the infamous Disco Demolition Night promotion at a White Sox game at Comiskey Park. The same year on Halloween 1979, perhaps the most outrageous interview seen on Snyder's show occurred when the rock band Kiss appeared to promote their album, Dynasty. During that 25-minute interview, the conversation degenerated into a somewhat chaotic exchange between Snyder and a very drunk Ace Frehley who picked up Snyder's teddy bear, put the wristlets from his costume on the bear, and laughed, \\"the only Spacebear in captivity! I've got him ‚Äî he's captured!\\" When Snyder asked Ace if his costume was that of some sort of spaceman, Frehley quipped, \\"No, actually I'm a plumber.\\" Snyder shot back, \\"Well, I've got a piece of pipe backstage I'd like to have you work on.\\" The inebriated Frehley replied \\"Tell me about it!\\", and clapped his hands and cackled hysterically at the exchange. Years later, Gene Simmons revealed on his website that he felt \\"betrayed\\" by the other band members during this interview. Shortly thereafter, drummer Peter Criss officially left the band and subsequently appeared on the show, making Snyder the first host to have a member of KISS appearing without makeup in public. Another run-in Snyder had with petulant rock stars occurred on 27 June 1980 in a cigarette smoke-filled appearance of Public Image Ltd.'s John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) and Keith Levene, whose thoroughly uncooperative twelve-minute interview on the show acquired a long- term notoriety. Snyder called it \\"one dumb moment of television\\", but TV Guide listed it among the 10 greatest rock and roll moments in the history of television.Snyder vs. Lydon The title card on Snyder's show had dovetailed \\"Tom\\" and \\"Tomorrow\\", by highlighting \\"Tom\\" in a different color. Retooling the format: Tomorrow Coast to Coast By late summer 1980, as a consequence of Johnny Carson's legal battle with NBC over the terms of his contract that was settled out of court and led to the host finally succeeding in scaling The Tonight Show running time down to an hour (something that he petitioned NBC for years), Tomorrow's starting time was moved half an hour earlier to 12:30 a.m. while its run time expanded to 90 minutes. To fill the extra 30 minutes, NBC decided to turn Tomorrow into a more typical entertainment talk show by taping it in front of a live studio audience, including live musical performances, and announcing the addition of gossip reporter Rona Barrett as co-host. Snyder resented all three changes, repeating his often stated discomfort with doing \\"big television\\", instead preferring the intimate setting that allows real conversations as well as sincere and genuine personal moments to take place. He also felt live audiences turn up at TV shows for specific reasons such as winning prizes or getting uproarious laughs, and since Tomorrow provided neither, he thought them entirely unnecessary on his program. The first episode in the new time slot aired on September 8, 1980 with Snyder interviewing Rona Barrett as guest and announcing her arrival on the show on October 27.Tomorrow;8 September 1980 The program alternated between Snyder who was in New York City interviewing general interest guests and Barrett who was in Hollywood, filing entertainment reports. In January 1981, the show's name was changed to Tomorrow Coast to Coast. It also adapted an instrumental version of Dan Hartman's Relight My Fire as its theme. The network wanted the show to attract younger viewers and thus started booking younger musical and entertainment acts for interviews followed by performances. These would on occasion cross over into bizarre territory such as a March 1981 appearance by the punk band the Plasmatics during which lead singer Wendy O. Williams sledgehammered a TV in the studio. The explosion disrupted a live broadcast of NBC Nightly News with anchorman John Chancellor being produced in a studio two floors above. Snyder himself referred to this occurrence on a May 1981 follow-up appearance in which the Plasmatics blew up a car. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's first television appearance was on the April 21 1981 installment of the show, where he performed \\"Another One Rides the Bus\\". A few months later, in June 1981, Irish rock band U2's first American television appearance also took place on Tomorrow Coast to Coast. In an effort to attract more viewers, NBC turned to spectacle television. On June 12, 1981, Snyder's prison interview with mass murderer Charles Manson aired. Manson was by turns quietly mesmerizing and disturbingly manic, suddenly getting a wild look in his eyes and spouting wild notions at Snyder before temporarily returning to a calm demeanor. Though it brought the show a huge ratings number, Snyder was never comfortable with the interview, feeling that it \\"established absolutely nothing, other than what was already well known ‚Äî that Manson is a nutcase\\". Behind the scenes, and sometimes even in front of them, Snyder and Barrett never got along and a feud between the two erupted as Snyder refused to acknowledge Barrett as co-host, referring to her only as a correspondent, and refused to let her segment lead the show when she has a major interview and once refused to introduce her segment. Barrett quit the series in June 1981.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/06/17/the-rona- syndrome/7408d69b-0db4-42e1-b90d-0ca341878e18/ Cancellation The show lasted for barely over a year in its new format. Among the terms of Carson's agreement to stay with NBC was that he would gain control of the time slot following The Tonight Show.Bushkin, Henry. How Johnny Carson Nearly Quit 'Tonight' and Scored TV's Richest Deal Ever. The Hollywood Reporter. Retrieved September 4, 2014. On November 9, 1981, NBC and Carson's production company Carson Productions announced the creation of Late Night with David Letterman, a program set to premiere in early 1982 in the 12:30 a.m. time slot Monday through Thursday. NBC offered Snyder the 1:30 to 2:30 a.m. time slot following Letterman, but he refused and the show was canceled. The last first-run Tomorrow Coast to Coast show aired on December 17, 1981, with Snyder's old favorite Chevy Chase as the final guest; Chase famously criticized the network during the broadcast for cancelling the show. Chase's segment was followed by one of earlier guest Peter Allen performing his song \\"I'd Rather Leave While I'm in Love.\\" Reruns subsequently aired until January 28, 1982. The slot Snyder had been offered had he agreed to continue the show was given to NBC News Overnight in July 1982. In 1988, NBC launched Later with Bob Costas, a half-hour long-form interview show with a similar format to Tomorrow, in the 1:30 a.m. slot and which Snyder occasionally guest hosted. David Letterman and Snyder already had a history together: a 1978 Tomorrow episode hosted by Snyder was almost exclusively devoted to a long interview with up-and-coming new comedy talents Letterman, Billy Crystal and Merrill Markoe. Two years later on September 22, 1980, Letterman (now the host of a morning program on NBC) appeared once more on Tomorrow (now in the new Coast to Coast format). The two remained on good terms even after Letterman took over Snyder's 12:30 a.m. slot on NBC. Letterman often expressed his admiration for Snyder's style and would occasionally call-in to Snyder's radio show on ABC Radio/NBC Talknet and his television CNBC talk show during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1995, Letterman handpicked Snyder to host a late night talk show following his Late Show on CBS - The Late Late Show, produced by Letterman's Worldwide Pants Incorporated, aired until 1999. Scheduling The show was scheduled at 1:00 AM in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (Midnight Central and Mountain time), immediately following The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. The program aired only four nights a week, Monday through Thursday, in order to accommodate the weekly shows The Midnight Special (1973‚Äì81) and SCTV Network 90 (1981‚Äì82) in that time slot on Fridays. It was originally broadcast from the NBC Studios in Burbank, California. NBC's Los Angeles station KNBC, where Snyder worked as an evening news anchor, was also located in that facility; Snyder would tape Tomorrow after signing-off from KNBC's 6:00 pm newscast. In December 1974 the program relocated to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, where Snyder took on additional anchor duties for NBC News and the network's flagship station, WNBC-TV. In June 1977, the show returned to Burbank until 1979, when Snyder once again began originating from New York. On September 8, 1980, when The Tonight Show was shortened to 60 minutes, Tomorrow was scheduled at 12:30 AM/11:30 PM and lengthened to 90 minutes, a format that lasted until its cancellation 16 months later. NBC affiliates began dropping the show, most notably Group W-owned sister stations KYW-TV in Philadelphia (where Snyder had worked as a popular local news anchor and talk show host earlier) and WBZ-TV in Boston, both of which replaced the program with reruns of Hawaii Five-O. Awards and nominations The show was nominated for three Emmy Awards: one in 1976 for Outstanding Achievement in Technical Direction and Electronic Camerawork and two in 1981 for Special Classification of Outstanding Program and Individual Achievement.

Located in the residential area Valle-Hovin, in amongst trees and a park, one finds Valle Hovin. It is reachable from the Lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 reaching the Helsfyr station of the Oslo T-bane metro system, and additionally via two bus lines as well as substantial parking for automobiles. As a concert venue Valle Hovin can hold at least 40,000 people, many of whom stand on the concrete floor where the rink is laid in winter. Many internationally famous popular music acts have appeared there, the first one being Tina Turner on 20 June 1987. Prior to a June 1995 expansion, the concert capacity was 30,000. As a concert venue it is not always thought of as best, due to lack of seating and limited sightlines once well back in the crowd, but it offers larger capacity than the indoor Oslo Spektrum and is sometimes deemed preferable to Ullevaal Stadion due to having a concrete floor that cannot be damaged by stage and moving equipment as can that football ground's more delicate turf.

Shchekochikhin made his name writing about and campaigning against the influence of organized crime and corruption. His last non-fiction book, Slaves of the KGB, was about people who worked as KGB informers. As a journalist for the newspaper Novaya Gazeta (NG), Shchekochikhin investigated apartment bombings allegedly directed by the Russian secret services and the Three Whales Corruption Scandal which involved high-ranking FSB officers and was related to money laundering through the Bank of New York. Shchekochikhin died suddenly on 3 July 2003 from a mysterious illness a few days before his scheduled departure to the United States, where he planned to meet with FBI investigators. His medical documents, according to NG, were either lost or destroyed by authorities. The symptoms of his illness fit a pattern of poisoning by radioactive materials and were similar to the symptoms of Nikolai Khokhlov, Roman Tsepov, and Alexander Litvinenko. According to Litvinenko and news reports, the death of Yuri Shchekochikhin was a politically motivated assassination.  Investigative journalism and political career  Shchekochikhin graduated from the Journalism Department of Moscow State University in 1975. He worked as an investigative journalist at Komsomolskaya Pravda (1972‚Äì1980) and Literaturnaya Gazeta (1980‚Äì1996), and then as a deputy editor of the liberal newspaper Novaya Gazeta (from 1996). Beginning in the 1990s, he published many articles critical of the First and Second Chechen Wars, human rights abuses in the Russian army, state corruption, and other social issues. In the summer of 1988, Shchekochikhin published an interview with a lieutenant colonel of the militia Aleksander Gurov, in which the existence of organized crime in the Soviet Union was first publicly stated. That brought fame to both Gurov (who became the head of the 6th Agency of the MVD of the USSR which struggled against organized crime) and Shchekochikhin. Yuri Shchekochikhin began his political career in 1990, when he was elected as a representative to the Congress of People's Deputies. He was elected to the Russian State Duma from the liberal Yabloko party in 1995. He was a member of a Duma committee on the problems of corruption, and was a UN expert on the problems of organized crime. He was a vocal opponent of the First and Second Chechen Wars. Since early 1995 he was an author and host of an investigative journalism program called \\"Special Team\\" on ORT, Russian television's first channel (then owned by Boris Berezovsky). In October 1995, the heads of the channel closed the program. According to Shchekochikhin, the reason was an episode called \\"For Motherland! For Mafia!\\", which was devoted to the Chechen War and was unleashed, in his opinion, by the \\"leading banks of Russia\\". In 2000, he accused Russia's Deputy PM Ilya Klebanov of covering up the fact that Russia did not have the resources to attempt a rescue of the Kursk submarine crew. From 2002, Shchekochikhin was a member of the Sergei Kovalev Commission, which investigated allegations that the 1999 Moscow apartment bombings had been orchestrated by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to generate support for the war. One of Shchekochikhin's last articles before his death was \\"Are we Russia or KGB of Soviet Union?\\". It described such issues as the refusal of the FSB to explain to the Russian Parliament what poison gas was applied during the Moscow theater hostage crisis, and the work of secret services from Turkmenistan, which operated with impunity in Moscow against Russian citizens of Turkm–µn origin. He also tried to investigate the Three Whales Corruption Scandal and criminal activities of FSB officers related to money laundering through the Bank of New York and illegal actions of Yevgeny Adamov, a former Russian Minister of Nuclear Energy. The Three Whales case was under the personal control of President Vladimir Putin. In June 2003, Shchekochikhin contacted the FBI and got an American visa to discuss the case with US authorities. However, he never made it to the USA because of his sudden death. Some Russian media claimed that Putin has issued an order to discharge 19 high-ranking FSB officers involved in this case in September 2006 as part of a Kremlin power struggle, but all these officers still continues to work in their FSB positions as of November 2006. Death Shchekochikhin died suddenly on 3 July 2003 after a mysterious 16-day illness. It was officially declared that he died from an allergic Lyell's syndrome. His medical treatment and his post-mortem took place at the Central Clinical Hospital, which is \\"tightly controlled by the Russian Federal Security Service because it treats top-ranking Russian officials\\". His relatives were denied an official medical report about the cause of his illness, and were forbidden to take specimens of his tissues for an independent medical investigation. Journalists of Novaya Gazeta managed to send his tissue specimens to \\"major foreign specialists\\". The experts did not reach any definite conclusion. This caused widespread speculation about the cause of his death, especially since another member of the Kovalev commission, Sergei Yushenkov, was assassinated the same year and the legal counsel and investigator of the commission, Mikhail Trepashkin, was arrested by Russian authorities. Some news reports drew parallels between the poisonings of Shchekochikhin, Alexander Litvinenko, and president Vladimir Putin‚Äôs former bodyguard Roman Tsepov, who died in a similar way in St. Petersburg in September 2004. Others noted Lecha Islamov, a Chechen rebel, who died in a Russian prison in 2004. ‚ÄúAll three cases of poisoning ‚Äì of Islamov, Shchekochikhin and Litvinenko ‚Äì are united not only by the clinical picture, which is identical even in terms of the details, but also by the fact that the traces of the poisoners clearly point to one address: Moscow, Lubyanka (FSB headquarters),‚Äù according to a Chechenpress report written by Zelimkhan Khadzhiev. Last book and publications Shchekochikhin's last published book was Slaves of the KGB: 20th Century. The Religion of Betrayal (–†–∞–±—ã –ì–ë. XX –≤–µ–∫. –†–µ–ª–∏–≥–∏—è –ø—Ä–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞), telling the real stories of some of the many people forcibly recruited by the Russian KGB (the domestic operations of which later became the FSB) to work as undercover informers or agents. These people virtually became their KGB controllers' slaves, betraying their relatives, close friends and colleagues. When he died, he had not finished working on a book about the 20th Century wars in Chechnya. In an interview he gave just before his death, he said Investigation At the request of the Novaya Gazeta newspaper staff, the Investigative Committee of the General Prosecutor's Office of Russia reopened the investigation into his death on 27 October 2007. In April 2008, an Investigative Committee official said that there would be another test carried out on his tissue to ascertain whether there had been a case of poisoning. The Prosecutor General of Russia closed the criminal case in April 2009 after the examination has failed to prove poisoning or a violent death.

As a great lover of British poetry, Maxwell memorized poems and wrote his own. The best known is Rigid Body Sings closely based on Comin' Through the Rye by Robert Burns, which he apparently used to sing while accompanying himself on a guitar. It has the immortal opening lines : :Gin a body meet a body :Flyin' through the air. :Gin a body hit a body, :Will it fly? And where?

The platform's software client is available for personal computer and mobile platforms. Origin contains social features such as profile management, networking with friends with chat and direct game joining along with an in-game overlay, streaming via Twitch and sharing of game library and community integration with networking sites like Facebook, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Network. In 2011, Electronic Arts stated that it wanted Origin to match Valve's Steam service, Origin's primary competitor, by adding cloud game saves, auto-patching, achievements, and cross-platform releases. By 2013, Origin had over 50 million registered users. EA has announced in September 2020 that it plans to retire Origin in favor of a new EA Desktop client for its EA Play service in the future. Components Origin store Origin in February 2015 The Origin store allows users to browse and purchase games for full price from Electronic Arts' catalogs. Instead of receiving a box, disc, or even CD key, purchased software is immediately attached to the user's Origin account and is to be downloaded with the corresponding Origin client. Origin guarantees download availability forever after purchase, and there is no limit to the number of times a game can be downloaded. Users may also add certain EA games to their Origin account by using CD keys from retail copies, and digital copies obtained from other digital distribution services. However, the addition of retail keys to Origin is restricted to games from 2009 onwards and older keys will not work even if the game is available on Origin, unless user contacts customer support. Origin client The Origin client is self-updating software that allows users to download games, expansion packs, content booster packs and patches from Electronic Arts. It shows the status of components available. The Origin client is designed to be similar to its competitor, Steam. The Origin In Game overlay client can be disabled while playing games. The client also features chat features such as a Friends List and a group chat options (implemented in version 9.3). Client and download performance has been patched and improved in past updates. Origin Mobile Electronic Arts also plans to launch the Origin platform for mobile devices (such as iOS devices) and achievements can be synced across both platforms. Scrabble Network will be incorporated into Origin Mobile. These services will be free of charge. EA Play Origin Access logo EA released a subscription service for accessing and playing their games on PC in 2016 originally called EA Access; via the Origin client, this was called Origin Access. Users can choose between paying a monthly or yearly subscription fee to access a large collection of EA titles (known as The Vault). Origin Access subscribers also get a 10% discount on all Origin purchases. Starting in March 2018, Origin Access starting offering titles from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and was looking to add other publishers' titles, including those from indie games. At E3 2018 EA announced a premium tier for Origin Access called Origin Access Premier, that allows to play future EA games early, the games will be full version in contrast to the \\"First Trials\\" giving to basic Origin Access members. To streamline branding, EA renamed both EA Access and Origin Access both to EA Play, with the Origin Access Premier named to EA Play Pro. In September 2020, EA announced it plans to retire Origin in favor for a new desktop client to be called \\"EA Desktop\\" that will support the new EA Play and EA Play Pro subscriptions. It is expected all Origin content will carry over to the new EA Desktop client once it is fully released. The EA Desktop client began its beta test in September 2020 with no planned date for full release. History EA Downloader was launched in late 2005. It was replaced by EA Link in November 2006, adding trailers, demos and special content to the content delivery service. In September 2007, it was once again replaced by the combination of EA Store and EA Download Manager. Users purchase from the EA Store website and use the downloadable EADM client to download their games. Games bought via EA Link were downloadable using the EA Download Manager. The store and client was reopened under the Origin name on June 3, 2011.EA launches Origin The digital distribution software was first used to deliver the Battlefield 2: Special Forces expansion pack, and subsequently most EA titles. The biggest product launch on the software is Spore Creature Creator. EA acquired the trademark Origin when it purchased Origin Systems in 1992. Origin Systems was a major game studio in the 1980s and 1990s, best known for its Ultima, Wing Commander, and Crusader game franchises. Criticism and controversy Removal of Crysis 2 from Steam and Origin exclusives Shortly after the launch of Origin, Crysis 2 was pulled from Steam and appeared on EA's website with an \\"only on Origin\\" claim, though it remained available on other distribution services. EA has since stated that Valve removed Crysis 2 due to imposed \\"business terms\\" and that \\"this was not an EA decision or the result of any action by EA.\\" Since then, Crysis 2: Maximum Edition (a re-release of Crysis 2 with all the DLCs) has been released on Steam, matching EA's story about pulling Crysis 2 due to DLC restraints. EA has confirmed that Battlefield 3 would not be available through Steam. The game is currently available for purchase on other non-Origin services such as GameFly, Green Man Gaming or GamersGate, but the Origin client must be used regardless of where the game was purchased. Starting from the release of Battlefield 3 in 2011 until November 2019, every first-party game EA published on PC was exclusive to the Origin service. In late 2019, EA began releasing their games on Steam again, starting with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, however, the game still uses the Origin client to launch. Origin account bans There have been several instances of EA enforcing such bans for what critics argue are comparatively minor infractions, such as making rude comments in EA or BioWare's official forums or in chat. During March 2011, a user named \\"Arno\\" was banned for allegedly making the comment \\"Have you sold your souls to the EA devil?\\" Arno's account was banned for 72 hours which prevented him from playing any of his Origin games. After reporting on the details of the incident, website Rock, Paper, Shotgun received a statement from EA saying that Arno's account ban was a mistake, and that future violations on the forums would not interfere with Origin users' access to their games. Later during October and November 2011, one user was banned for posting about teabagging dead players. Another user received a 72-hour account suspension for posting a link to his own network troubleshooting guide in the EA forums. EA interpreted this as a \\"commercial\\" link, even though the same link had been posted elsewhere in the forums, and EA's own corporate support site and FAQ. One user was permanently banned for submitting a forum post containing the portmanteau \\"e-peen,\\" which is slang for \\"electronic penis.\\" Security weaknesses EA has been criticized for not encrypting Origin's XMPP chat functionality, which is available in Origin and in Origin powered games. Unencrypted data includes account numbers, session tokens, as well as the message contents itself. With this type of data, user accounts might get compromised. Accusations of spying Origin's end-user license agreement (EULA) gives EA permission to collect information about users' computers regardless of its relation to the Origin program itself, including \\"application usage (including but not limited to successful installation and/or removal), software, software usage and peripheral hardware.\\" Initially, the EULA also contained a passage permitting EA to more explicitly monitor activity as well as to edit or remove material at their discretion. A report by the news magazine Der Spiegel covered the allegations. In response to the controversy, EA issued a statement claiming they \\"do not have access to information such as pictures, documents or personal data, which have nothing to do with the execution of the Origin program on the system of the player, neither will they be collected by us.\\" EA also added a sentence to the EULA stating that they would not \\"use spyware or install spyware on users' machines,\\" though users must still consent to allowing EA to collect information about their computers.  Situation in Germany  According to reports in German newspapers, the German version of Origin's EULA violates several German laws, mainly laws protecting consumers and users' privacy. According to Thomas Hoeren, a judge and professor for information, telecommunication and media law at the University of M√ºnster, the German version of the EULA is a direct translation of the original without any modifications and its clauses are \\"null and void\\".

The manuscript is now preserved in the Hugh Nevill collection at the British Museum.  Plot  The victory of the Karaiyars over the Mukkuvars happened in the Saka era 1159, corresponding to the 15th century. About 7700 Karaiyar chieftains from Kanchipuram, Kaveripattinam and Kilakarai of Tamil Nadu arrived in Sri Lanka under the invitation of Parakramabahu VI of Kotte. The army was led by the chieftains Kurukula Nattu Thevar, Adiarasa Adappan, Varunasuriya Adappan, Kurukulasuriya Mudaliyar, Bharathakulasuriya Mudaliyar, Arasakulasuriya Mudaliyar and their main royal chief Manikka Thalaivan. The chieftains first overthrew the fort of Puttalam after a three month siege with the Mukkuvar, with the loss of their own 1,500 troops. The Mukkuvar were led by their leader Nala Mudaliyar. The Karaiyar chieftains thereafter proceeded to Nagapattinam and overthrew the fort there after another four months siege with the loss of additional 1300 troops, where also their royal Karaiyar leader, Manikka Thalaivan got killed. Manikka Thalaivan's sons were eventually adopted by Parakramabahu VI, one of whom is known as Sapumal Kumaraya. The chieftains settled after the victory in the area between Chilaw and Negombo.

It is one of a handful of pictures in that genre directed by Jack Arnold, better known for his science-fiction movies of the era. Although it is one of Universal Pictures modestly budgeted vehicles for World War II hero Audie Murphy, the top-billed actor is unusually, but very effectively, cast as the villain, a cold-blooded gun-for-hire.No Name on the Bullet at Audie Murphy Memorial Site Plot When infamous hired gunman John Gant (Audie Murphy) arrives in the small town of Lordsburg, Arizona, the locals are terrified by his reputation and surprised by how young he is. Although Sheriff Buck Hastings would like to arrest Gant, he points out to the townsmen that Gant always coerces his rivals to draw their gun first, allowing him to kill them legally in \\"self-defence.\\" While the men in the town speculate anxiously about Gant's target, Luke Canfield (played by Charles Drake, an off-screen friend and frequent co-star with Murphy), the town blacksmith and doctor, greets Gant and is totally unaware of Gant's reputation as a hired gunman. During his first meeting with Gant at the smithy, Luke demonstrates his perfect aim with a maul. Luke proudly takes Gant on a tour through town and agrees to join him later for a game of chess. At home, Luke's fianc√©e, Anne Benson, tends to her father, Judge Benson, who suffers from consumption. Luke's father Asa joins them for dinner, during which Buck arrives to warn Luke to stay away from Gant. Asa cautions Buck not to condemn Gant prematurely, but Buck is reluctant to accept his advice and reveals that he feels he will be powerless against Gant's superior gun skills. Later, mine owners Earl Stricker and Thad Pierce assume that their partner, Ben Chaffee, has hired Gant to kill them in order to take sole ownership of the mine. When they find Gant in the saloon and propose a counter-offer, however, Gant observes that no innocent man would be afraid, and turns them away. Upon hearing that Stricker and Pierce were seen talking with Gant, Chaffee assumes that they want to kill him. He questions Luke about Gant, and after Luke fails to calm him, the physician walks through town, noting that the townsmen are all hiding behind guns and locked doors. While clerk Lou Fraden and his wife Roseanne discuss their certainty that her ex- husband has sent Gant to kill them, Luke confronts Gant, asking him why he has come. Impressed with Luke's bravery and integrity, Gant explains that he believes that Luke, who saves the lives of men \\"who deserve to die,\\" is less ethical than he. While they talk, a panicked Pierce shoots himself in his office and dies later that night. After this, Luke accuses Gant of murder. When Buck tries to throw Gant out of town, Gant refuses to leave. When the sheriff pulls a gun on Gant, Gant shoots him in the hand and renders him useless. When asked why Gant didn't kill him, the gunman explains it was because no one was paying him. Later, Judge Benson advocates using vigilante law to throw out Gant, but after Luke protests, suggests sacrificing the one man Gant is after in order to save the rest of the town. Meanwhile, Fraden, emboldened by alcohol, confronts Gant, who calmly encourages him to draw his gun. At Luke's urging, Fraden flees, leaving Luke to demand fruitlessly that Gant leave town. Next, Stricker gathers the townsmen to challenge Gant, and although Luke disapproves, he agrees to lead them, hoping to minimize the possible violence. Gant, angered to see Luke backed by a mob, warns the men that if they shoot him he will still live long enough to kill Luke, Reeger, Asa, Stricker and several other town leaders. The men disband silently. Later, Luke confesses to Judge Benson that he likes Gant, and the judge warns him that Gant's viciousness is a progressive disease that he cannot cure. In the store the next day, Gant approaches Anne and questions her about her home life, but will not reveal his target. At the same time, the judge speculates to Luke that if the hunted man refused to defend himself, Gant could be legally arrested for murder, but Luke declares that no man could die without fighting. Soon after, Chafee and his men begin a shootout with Stricker which results in the death of many men. Sickened by a situation that he can not deal with, Sheriff Hastings takes off his badge and drops it on the street. Anne, who has grown suspicious about her father the judge, reads a letter locked in his drawer that reveals a past crime. Realizing the likelihood that Gant has been hired to kill her father, she goes to Gant's room with a gun. Gant bluffs her that her gun is unloaded and then easily takes it away from her. Anne declares that the judge will not defend himself, prompting Gant to rip off a piece of the upper part of her dress. Gant goes to the judge's home and tells him that his \\"friends from back East send their respects\\". The old man admits his past guilt and tells Gant that he knows enough to send himself, the governor, and several other wealthy and powerful men to prison, but all they have to do is wait and nature will do Gant's job for him. Unfortunately, his old associates are impatient. Of course, the Judge refuses to fight. Gant then shows him the piece of Anne's dress and implies that he has raped her. The old judge is angered enough to grab a rifle and follow Gant outside. The old man has severe coughing and fires a wild shot before collapsing on the porch steps. Luke arrives and sees Gant with his gun drawn and assumes that Gant shot the old man. Luke starts to throw a hammer at him, but Gant shoots him in the right shoulder. As Gant is walking away toward his horse, Luke uses his left arm to throw a hammer. Just as Gant turns around, he is struck in the upper part of his gun arm and breaking it so that Gant can no longer shoot. As Gant laboriously mounts his horse, Asa tells Luke that the old man was not shot. Luke offers to tend to his arm, but Gant replies that \\"Everything comes to a finish\\" and rides away.

Peter has been a Labor Party member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly since November 2009, representing the electorate of Willagee. Early life and military career Born in the northern Perth suburb of Karrinyup, Tinley joined the Australian Army in 1981 and graduated from Royal Military College, Duntroon, earning the Queen's Medal as the cadet graduating top of his class. He spent 17 of his 25 years in the army in the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR). In 2002, he was the lead tactical planner for Australia's special forces advising the United States, and in 2003 he served as Deputy Commander for the Special Forces Task Group in Iraq. In the same year, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the military division for \\"dynamic leadership and consistent professional excellence\\".From the Australian Army Soldier's Newspaper ‚Äì 'Absolute commitment' In late 2006, after leaving the army with the rank of major, Tinley spoke out against the decision of the Howard government to support the US and British initiative to invade Iraq on the basis of purported evidence of the country's possession of weapons of mass destruction. He also called for the immediate withdrawal of Australian troops. In the meantime, Tinley conducted strategic planning and leadership workshops. Among other clients, he worked with the West Coast Eagles Football Club coaching staff. He also ran a small business. Political career In 2006, former federal opposition leader Kim Beazley approached Tinley to run for the federal Division of Stirling as the Labor Party's endorsed candidate at the 2007 election. The sitting member, Liberal MP Michael Keenan, retained the seat with a slightly reduced majority. Upon the resignation of former Premier Alan Carpenter from the safe Labor state seat of Willagee, Tinley was preselected to run for Labor at the resulting by-election on 28 November 2009. He was ultimately elected as the member for Willagee with over 60% of the two-party-preferred vote against the Greens' Hsien Harper. Upon Labor's election to government at the 2017 state election, Tinley was appointed to the McGowan Ministry as Minister for Mines and Petroleum, Veterans Issues, and Youth on 17 March. Five days later on 22 March, Tinley resigned as Mines and Petroleum minister, to avoid any claim of conflict of interest due to a family member working in the industry, and exchanged the Housing portfolio with Bill Johnston.

January 1898 Map of the Cleveland, Lorain and Wheeling Railway The Lake Shore and Tuscarawas Valley Railway Company (LS&TV;) was chartered by the state of Ohio on July 2, 1870. It was granted authority to build a line from Berea, Ohio, to Mill Township in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, where it would join the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad line. A branch to Elyria, Ohio, was also authorized. In October 1872, the company purchased the long Elyria and Black River Railway Company (E&BR; chartered in 1871), which allowed for completion of the main line between Berea and Uhrichsville, Ohio. The Elyria branch was completed in August 1873. In March 1873, the LS&TV; filed an amendment to its charter to allow it to extend its tracks south to Washington Township in Tuscarawas County. But the LS&TV; fell into receivership in July 1874 for failing to pay its mortgage on the E&BR;, and the E&BR; was sold for $1 million to Cleveland railroad executive Selah Chamberlain. On January 30, 1875, Chamberlain sold the E&BR; to Amasa Stone, Robert L. Chamberlain (Selah's son), Ebenezer B. Thomas, Clement Russell, and Edward Kent (an investor from New York City). These owners formed the Cleveland, Tuscarawas Valley and Wheeling Railway (CTV&W;) to take over the assets of the LS&TV.; The CTV&W; filed a charter amendment in March 1877 to extend its line from Uhrichsville south through Tuscarawas, Harrison, Belmont counties to the West Wheeling, Ohio, on the Ohio River (just south of Bridgeport). (This route was probably the same as U.S. Route 250.) But the railroad once again fell into receivership in February 1883, and Edward R. Perkins purchased it for just under $2.9 million. Perkins immediately sold the railroad back to an investors' group led by Stone, and which included Selah Chamberlain, Worthy S. Streator (a major creditor of the line), Robert L. Chamberlain, and Andrew J. Baggs. They filed a charter on March 1, 1883, to incorporate the Cleveland, Lorain and Wheeling Railway (CL&W;), which would assume the assets of the CTV&W.; In June 1886, the CL&W; filed an amendment to their charter to extend the line south of West Wheeling to the town of Bellaire, Ohio. In August 1887, another amendment extended the line a short distance north into Bridgeport. B&O; ownership In 1898, a high-level bridge crossing of the Ohio River was made at Bellaire, connecting the CL&W; with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;). In February 1901, the CL&W; had about $5 million in preferred stock. Elsewhere, the B&O; fell into receivership on February 28, 1896. By the time the B&O; emerged from bankruptcy in 1901, the Pennsylvania Railroad had obtained a controlling (if minority) interest in the road's stock.; In December 1901, the B&O; purchased $2.7 million of preferred stock in the CL&W;, giving it a controlling interest in the company. The B&O; made additional purchases of CL&W; stock over the next six years, until in March 1908 it purchased all remaining outstanding shares and made the CL&W; a subsidiary of the road. C&O;/Chessie System/CSX ownership The CL&W; remained part of the B&O; until 1963. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad fought for control of the B&O.; But beginning in 1960, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) began purchasing large quantities of B&O; preferred stock. By March 1962 it controlled 60 percent of the B&O.; But the Pennsylvania and the New York Central agreed to a merger in March 1962, putting an end to this competition. The C&O; then sought sole ownership of the B&O;, and succeeded in acquiring the New York Central's 20 percent share. The merger was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission in March 1963.; ; ; The C&O; formed a holding company, the Chessie System, in 1973. The B&O; continued to operate as a distinct company under the Chessie System. The Chessie System merged with Seaboard Coast Line Industries (owner of the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, the Clinchfield Railroad, and the Georgia Railroad and Banking Company) on November 1, 1980, to form CSX Corporation. CSX Corporation assigned its railroads to a new subsidiary, CSX Transportation, on July 1, 1986. The B&O;'s distinct identity ended in October 1986 (one year before the railroad itself was absorbed by the C&O; and CSX), at which time the CL&W; was downgraded to become a subdivision of CSX Transportation. Description of the line The CL&W; Subdivision consists of a portion of the former track of the Cleveland, Lorain, & Wheeling Railway, and as of 2010 was long. The northern terminus of the CL&W; Subdivision is with the Lake Terminal Railroad at Lorain, Ohio, near the shore of Lake Erie just west of the Black River. It travels south-southeast and south to pass through Elyria, where it crosses the Norfolk Southern's Cleveland-Toledo- Chicago Line. It continues south-southeast and then southeast to Grafton, where there is a connection with CSX's Greenwich Subdivision. It continues southeast to Lester, (a small town on Ohio State Route 57 about northwest of Medina), where it connects with CSX's Cleveland Subdivision. It partially follows Mallet Creek south, then passes below the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway west of Medina (about northwest of U.S. Route 42). After an at-grade crossing of U.S. Route 42, It continues south-southeast, passing east of Chippewa Lake, below Interstate 71 and Interstate 76, and through the town of Seville before reaching its southern terminus with CSX's New Castle Subdivision at Sterling. The CL&W; Subdivision is a single track line, except for of double track at Sterling. Trains are limited to along the entire length of the line.

A zhuz (, Ÿ¥ÿ¨€áÿ≤, , also translated as \\"horde\\" or \\"hundred\\") is one of the three main territorial and tribal divisions in the Kypchak Plain area that covers much of the contemporary Kazakhstan, and represents the main tribal division within the ethnic group of the Kazakhs. *The Senior zhuz () or Uly zhuz covers territories of southern and southeastern Kazakhstan, northwestern China (Xinjiang) and parts of Uzbekistan. *The Middle zhuz () or Orta zhuz consists of six tribes, covering central and eastern Kazakhstan *The Junior zhuz () or Kishi zhuz consists of three tribes, covering western Kazakhstan and western Russia (Orenburg Oblast).  History  The earliest mention of the Kazakh zhuz or hordes dates to the 17th century. Velyaminov-Zernov (1919) believed that the division arose as a result of the capture of the important cities of Tashkent, Yasi, and Sayram in 1598.Velyaminov-Zernov, \\"Russia, Mongolia, China in the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries\\". Vol II. Baddeley (1919, MacMillan, London). Reprint ‚Äì Burt Franklin, New York. 1963 p. 59. Some researchers argued that the zhuz in origin corresponded to tribal, military alliances of steppe nomads that emerged around the mid-16th century after the disintegration of the Kazakh Khanate. Yuri Zuev argued their territorial division comprises three ecological or topographic zones, the Senior zhuz of the southern and southeastern steppe being set apart from the two other zones by Lake Balkhash. According to some researchers, Kazakhs was separated in the first civil war in the Kazakh Khanate. Tribes that recognized Buidash Khan formed Senior zhuz. Tribes that recognized Togim Khan formed Middle zhuz. Tribes that recognized Akhmed Khan formed Junior zhuz. According to Kazakh legends, the three zhuz were the territorial inheritances of the three sons of the mythical founder father of the Kazakhs. In Kazakh language, j√∫z means either \\"union\\" or \\"hundred\\".  Senior zhuz  thumb|Ethnographic map of the Senior or Uly zhuz in Kazakhstan in the early 20th century, following M. S.

Historically, the Senior zhuz (; ) inhabited the northern lands of the former Chagatai Ulus of the Mongol Empire, in the Ili River and Chu River basins, in today's South-Eastern Kazakhstan and China's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture (northern Xinjiang). It was also called √úysin j√ºz. The first record of the Senior zhuz dates to 1748, due to a Tatar emissary of the Tsaritsa who had been sent to the steppe to negotiate the submission of Abul Khair Khan in 1732. According to Nikolai Aristov, the estimated population of the Senior zhuz was about 550,000 people in the second half of the 19th century. The territory was conquered by the Kokand Khanate in the 1820s, and by the Russian Empire during the 1850s to 1860s. Kazakhstan's ruling elite, including former president Nursultan Nazarbayev, former First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan Dinmukhamed Konayev, as well as famous poet Jambyl Jabayev are representatives of the Senior zhuz. There have been several attempts to determine the exact names and nature of top-level clans throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, different studies created vastly different names and population numbers for the steppe clans. Generally accepted names of the first order Senior zhuz tribes or clans are: * Dulat () ** Janys () ** Siyqym () ** Botbay () ** Shymyr () * Jalayir () * Qangly () * Alban () * Suwan () * Sary-Uysin ( ‚ÄúYellow Uysin‚Äù) * Shapyrashty () * Sirgeli () * Oshaqty () * Ysty () * Shanyshqyly ()  Middle zhuz  Ethnographic map of the Middle or Orta zhuz in Kazakhstan in the early 20th century, following M. S. Mukanov (1991). The Middle zhuz (; ), also known as Ar«µyn j√∫z, occupies the eastern lands of the former Golden Horde, in central, northern and eastern Kazakhstan. Some of Kazakhstan's famous poets and intellectuals were born in the Middle zhuz territories, including Abay Qunanbayuli, Akhmet Baytursinuli, Shokan Walikhanuli and Alikhan Bokeikhanov. The Middle zhuz consists of the following tribes: *Argyn () *Kerei () *Naiman () *Khongirad () *Qypchak () *Taraqty ) *Uwaq|Waq ()  Junior zhuz  The Junior or Lesser zhuz (; ), also known as Alshyn j√∫z, occupied the lands of the former Nogai Khanate in Western Kazakhstan. It was also called Alshyn j√∫z. They originate from the Nogais of the Nogai Horde, which once was placed in Western Kazakhstan, but in the 16th century it was defeated by the Kazakhs and the Russians and Nogais retreated to the Western part of their khanate, to the Kuban River steppes. In the 18th century, they endangered inner Russian cities, so the Russian Empire allied the Mongolic Kalmyks to supplant Alshyns back to the Urals. There they formed the Lesser zhuz. During Kazakh-Kalymk struggles, Khiva Khanate annexed Mangyshlak Peninsula for repelling Kalmyk raids and managed it for two centuries before Russian conquest. At the beginning of the 19th century, Kazakhs shifted some to the west, to Astrakhan Governorate, forming Bukey Horde there. As the Kazakh SSR was formed with Bukey Horde as the most remoted its western part, situated geographically in Europe. Historical leaders of Kazakh resistance against the Russian Empire associated with the Junior zhuz include Isatay Taymanuly (, 1791‚Äî1838) and Makhambet Otemisuly (, 1803/4‚Äì1846). The Junior zhuz consisted of three groups, subdivided into clans: *Baiuly () ** Adai () ** Alasha () ** Baibaqty () ** Berish () ** Zhappas () ** Masqar () ** Taz () ** Tana () ** Esentemir () ** Ysyq () ** Qyzylqurt () ** Sherkesh () *Alimuly () ** Qarakesek () ** Qarasaqal () ** Tortqara () ** Kete () ** Shomekei () ** Shekti () *Jetyru () ** Tabyn () ** Tama () ** Kerderi () ** Kereit () ** Zhagalbaily () ** Telew () ** Ramadan () See also *Kazakh tribes *Kazakh Khanate *Zhetysu *Ethnic demography of Kazakhstan *List of medieval Mongolian tribes and clans *Orda (structure)  References   Literature  *Svat Soucek, \\"A History of Inner Asia\\".

The proximal portion of the dorsal pancreatic bud gives rise to the accessory pancreatic duct, while the distal portion of the dorsal pancreatic bud and ventral pancreatic bud give rise to the major pancreatic duct. The ventral pancreatic bud develops into the pancreatic head and uncinate process. Associated Disorders In pancreas divisum the ducts of the pancreas are not fused to form a full pancreas, but instead it remains as a distinct dorsal and ventral duct. Without the proper fusion of both ducts the majority of the pancreas drainage is mainly through the accessory papilla. Three different variations in pancreas divisum have been described: the first is the classic example of pancreas divisum in which the ventral duct is visualized but there is total failure of fusion; the second variation is with the absence of a ventral duct; and the third variation is when there is very basic communication between the two ducts. Pancreatitis is a major complication of pancreas divisum. Additional images File:Gray1101.png|Pancreas of a human embryo of five weeks.

He was assassinated on 17 April 2003, just hours after registering his political party to participate in the December 2003 parliamentary elections. Political career Yushenkov was an elected member of all Russian Parliaments from 1989 to 2003. During the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, he organized the \\"living chain\\" of civilians who came to protect their Parliament in Moscow, and he successfully negotiated with military personnel sent to storm the building. As a person with a military background, Yushenkov was the strongest proponent of reform in the Russian Army, and he campaigned tirelessly to abolish conscription, reduce the size of the Army, and protect all rights of military personnel who suffered from abuse and dedovshchina. Yushenkov was a prominent critic of the First and Second Chechen Wars. He argued that Russian Army operates in Chechnya (a part of Russia) illegally. His political party, Liberal Russia, was officially formed on October 22, 2002. The other initial organizers of this party before its registration were Vladimir Golovlev, Victor Pokhmelkin, and controversial businessman Boris Berezovsky. Vladimir Golovlev was assassinated on 21 August 2002 (his killers were never found), and Boris Berezovsky was expelled, presumably on the request of State authorities who refused to register the party, and possibly due to tensions between the initial organizers of the party.http://graniru.org/Politics/Russia/m.64562.html Investigation of Russian apartment bombings Yushenkov was vice chairman of the Sergei Kovalev commission formed to investigate the Russian apartment bombings , and his views that the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) had orchestrated the bombings to generate public support for the Chechen War were similar to those of journalist David Satter, a Johns Hopkins University and Hoover Institute scholar.David Satter. Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State. Yale University Press. 2003. . During his visit to the United States in April 2002, Yushenkov described a secret order issued by Boris Yeltsin to initiate the Second Chechen War, according to Alexander GoldfarbSergei Yushenkov: That was a coup in 1999 . The order was issued in response to a demand from 24 Russian governors that the then-unpopular Yeltsin should transfer all state powers to Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Yeltsin's order was dated September 23, 1999, the same day that FSB operatives were caught red-handed while planting a bomb in an apartment complex in the city of Ryazan (after which the sequence of bombings in several Russian cities suddenly stopped). The next day, Vladimir Putin began the military campaign in Chechnya. According to Yushenkov, Putin's rise to power represented a successful coup d'√©tat organized by the FSB. On 5 March 2002, Yushenkov flew to the premier of the documentary film Assassination of Russia in London. The film described Russian apartment bombings as a terrorism act committed by Russian state security services.Alex Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko. \\"Death of a Dissident: The Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and the Return of the KGB.\\" Free Press, New York, 2007. , pages 249-252Boris Berezovsky organized \\"Assassination of Russia\\" He announced that his party Liberal Russia is going to distribute copies of the film around the country to demonstrate \\"how the secret services deceived Russian citizens\\". Although a number of copies were confiscated at Russian Customs, tens of thousands of copies of the film were smuggled and distributed in Russia. Investigation of Moscow theatre hostage crisis Yushenkov also investigated the alleged involvement of the FSB in staging the Moscow theatre hostage crisis through their agent provocateur Khanpash Terkibaev, the only hostage taker who left the theater alive and allegedly guided the terrorists to the theater. In the beginning of April 2003 former FSB Aleksander Litvinenko gave information about Terkibaev (\\"the Terkibaev file\\") to Sergei Yushenkov when he visited London. Yushenkov passed this file to Anna Politkovskaya. A few days later Yushenkov was assassinated. Terkibaev was killed later in a car crash in Chechnya. While flying south in September 2004 to help negotiate with those who had taken over a thousand hostages in a school in Beslan (North Ossetia), Politkovskaya fell violently ill and lost consciousness after drinking tea. She had reportedly been poisoned, with some accusing the former Soviet secret police poison facility. Assassination Sergei Yushenkov was shot dead near his house in Moscow on 17 April 2003, just hours after finally obtaining the registrations needed for his Liberal Russia party to participate in the December 2003 parliamentary elections in 55 regions. His last known public utterance was \\"Registration has been completed.\\" . Mikhail Trepashkin believed that Yushenkov was murdered because he was a leader of an opposition party that openly challenged the power of the FSB and Russian authorities. Moreover, Yushenkov promised voters an independent investigation of the Russian apartment bombings as a key issue of his election campaign (an interview of Trepashkin can be seen in director Andrei Nekrasov's documentary \\"Disbelief\\" , Google Video). Just before his death, Sergei Yushenkov received threats from a high-ranking FSB general, Aleksander Mikhailov, according to Grigory Pasko . Investigation Four people have been convicted during a controversial trial for the murder of Sergei Yushenkov and are currently serving prison sentences. Most prominent among them is Mikhail Kodanev, a former co-chairman of the Liberal Russia party organized by Yushenkov himself. During the trial, Mikhail Kodanev strenuously claimed to be innocent. He later tried to commit suicide and was placed in the FSB's special Lefortovo prison. According to attorney Henry Reznick, Kodanev was convicted solely on the basis of the false testimony of another convicted suspect (Alexander Vinnik) who made a series of contradictory statements, including claims that Yushenkov was killed by the government.Henry Reznik: Kodanev have been slandered, Grani.ru, 17 March 2004. Computer translation Critics also insisted that the political murders of two chairmen of the Liberal Russia party should have been considered as the same case in the court, which would make it clear that some of the suspects were wrongly accused.On 17 April, the last romantic died, Grani.ru, Vladimir Korsunsky, 17 April 2004. Computer translation. Some observers noted that Kodanev was relatively unknown in Russian politics until he was named to Yushenkov's party by Boris Berezovsky, ostensibly to make a mockery of Vladimir Putin (Kodanev was nicknamed \\"Putin\\" because he looks very much like the President). Some Russian media claimed that it was Boris Berezovsky who organized the murder of Sergei Yushenkov through his agent Mikhail Kodanev.

Osorio was born in Buenos Aires in 1953, and lived in Madrid, Spain, for 14 years before returning to Argentina in 2006. Osorio has been awarded Argentina's highest honor for literature, the Premio Nacional de Literatura (National Prize for Literature), and her work has also won the Argentores Award for Best Comedy Screenplay, the Humor Journalism Award, and an Amnesty International Award. She has also been a finalist for the Femina Prize (France). Her sixth novel, A veinte a√±os, Luz (1998) has been translated into 20 languages; the English-language version, My Name is Light, was first published in 2003. Literary work At the centre of her literary work lies an examination of contemporary Argentine history. In the process, she turns her attention in particular to the ramifications of politics for the individual, which she illustrates using striking biographies. The ¬ªFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung¬´ wrote that the author succeeds in ¬ªconvincing readers that the instruments of the art of story-telling are shown to be most effective at that point at which they lead us back to reality, where our perspective and our interests, whetted by the imagination, are recalled to reality.¬´ In 1982 she debuted with the volume of short stories ¬ªRitos privados¬´ (t: Private rites), for which she was awarded the most prestigious literature prize of her country, the Premio Nacional de Literatura Argentina, in the following year. She later published ¬ªBeatriz Guido¬´ (1991), a novel of this Argentine writer's life, and a collection of political and linguistic essays ¬ªLas malas lenguas¬´ (1994; t: The wicked tongues). Her sixth novel, ¬ªA veinte anos, Luz¬´ (1998; Eng. ¬ªMy name is Light¬´, 2003), was greeted with acclaim on the international scene. It won her Amnesty International's literary prize, was translated into more than fifteen languages, and published in twenty-three countries ‚Äì only in Argentina was she unable to find a publisher at first. The novel deals with a dark chapter of the Argentine military dictatorship. It tells the story of the fate and search for identity of a young woman, born to opponents of the Junta, who is taken away by the family of an officer who is loyal to the regime. Another prevailing theme in Osorio's work is tango, which she focused on in her screenplay, ¬ªLa Lecci√≥n de tango¬´ (1997; t: The tango lesson). Her most recent novel, ¬ªCielo de tango¬´ (2006; t: Tango Sky), also deals with the Argentine dance and merges history and imagination. Like the former work, it unfolds over various temporal planes and tells of two families of differing social backgrounds whose lives are intertwined through tango, beginning with the rise of Argentina in the late eighteenth century and leading up to the present day. For this novel she received the Premio de Bibliotecas in Italy and the Premio Acerbi. Awards and travel Among Osorio's further distinctions are an award for best comedy as well as a prize for journalistic satire. Since 2006, she has lived mostly in Buenos Aires, where she often runs creative writing workshops. From 2007 to 2010 she took part in different congresses and fairs, as for example in Saint Malo, \\"Etonnants Voyageurs\\", the International Literature Festival in Berlin, the Bookfair in Paris, the Bookfair in the Spanish Gij√≥n, the \\"Festival de la Palabra\\" in Puerto Rico, the Bookfair in Medellin and the Bookfair in Frankfurt. In 2009 she spent a month in Berlin for the LiteraturRaum project.

He was the heir of Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai, and after Yuwen Tai's death in 556, his cousin Yuwen Hu, serving as his guardian, forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue in spring 557, establishing Northern Zhou. Later in 557, however, Yuwen Jue, wanting to assume power personally, plotted to kill Yuwen Hu, who in turn deposed him and replaced him with his brother Yuwen Yu (Emperor Ming). Later that year, Yuwen Hu had Yuwen Jue executed. Background Yuwen Jue was born in 542 as the son of Yuwen Tai, then the paramount general of Western Wei, and Yuwen Tai's wife Princess Pingyi, the sister of Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei. He was Yuwen Tai's third son, but was largely viewed as Yuwen Tai's likely heir because his mother was both of royal birth and Yuwen Tai's wife, while his older brothers Yuwen Yu and Yuwen Zhen () were sons of concubines. In 550, he became the Duke of L√ºeyang. He later married Emperor Wen's daughter Yuan Humo the Princess Jin'an as his wife and duchess. In spring 556, Yuwen Tai was pondering the issue of succession. Yuwen Jue was born of the Princess Pingyi, but Yuwen Yu was older and married to the daughter of one of his chief generals, Dugu Xin. On the advice of Li Yuan (), who argued that the son of a wife always had precedence over the son of a concubine, Yuwen Tai made Yuwen Jue his heir apparent. in fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the norther provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (ÁâΩÂ±ØÂ±±, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned his nephew Yuwen Hu the Duke of Zhongshan to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and Yuwen Jue took over his titles (among them, Duke of Anding), while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state. Yuwen Jue set up his headquarters at Tong Province (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi), where Yuwen Tai's headquarters had been. Around the new year 557, Yuwen Jue gained the greater title of Duke of Zhou. In spring 557, Yuwen Hu, believing that Yuwen Jue's youth meant that he needed to take imperial title to affirm his authority, forced Emperor Gong to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue (as Emperor Xiaomin), ending Western Wei and starting Northern Zhou. Reign and death Emperor Xiaomin took the throne, but did not use the title \\"emperor\\" (ÁöáÂ∏ù, hu√°ng d√¨), but used the Zhou Dynasty- style title \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang). He posthumously honored Yuwen Tai as Prince Wen and the Princess Pingyi as Princess Wen. He created the former Emperor Gong the Duke of Song, but soon thereafter, the duke was executed. The governmental structure and ceremonies were largely imitative of Zhou Dynasty, but also incorporated many Xianbei elements, largely abandoning Han customs originated in the post-Zhou centuries. He created his wife, Duchess Yuan, princess. with Yuwen Hu as regent, The political situation was unstable. About a month after Emperor Xiaomin took the throne, two of the most senior officials, Zhao Gui () the Duke of Chu and Dugu Xin the Duke of Wei, showed displeasure about Yuwen Hu's hold on power. Zhao wanted to kill Yuwen Hu, an action that Dugu tried to persuade him against. Soon thereafter, however, Zhao's plans were revealed by another official, Yuwen Sheng (), and Yuwen Hu had Zhao executed and removed Dugu from his office. Soon, he also forced Dugu to commit suicide. When another official, Qi Gui (), criticized Yuwen Hu's regency, he was also executed. Meanwhile, Emperor Xiaomin himself, wanting to take power, was engaging in a plot to kill Yuwen Hu. His plot included two of Yuwen Tai's key associates, Li Zhi () and Sun Heng (), as well as the other officials Yifu Feng () and Heba Ti (), each of whom was ambitious and therefore further tried to fan Emperor Xiaomin's suspicions against Yuwen Hu. After Li tried to engage another official, Zhang Guangluo () in the plot, however, Zhang revealed the plot to Yuwen Hu. Yuwen Hu, not wanting to take drastic actions at first, sent Li and Sun away to be provincial governors. When Emperor Xiaomin wanted to summon Li and Sun back to the capital Chang'an, Yuwen Hu urged against it, pledging his loyalty. However, Yifu and Heba became fearful and plotted to carry out the plot anyway. Zhang again informed Yuwen Hu, who discussed the matter with the generals Helan Xiang () and Yuchi Gang (). Helan suggested to him to depose Emperor Xiaomin, and Yuwen Hu had Yuchi arrest Yifu and Heba and disband the imperial guards. Emperor Xiaomin, surprised by the move, barricaded himself in the palace and armed his ladies in waiting and eunuchs. Yuwen Hu sent Helan into the palace to force Emperor Xiaomin to leave the palace and put him under house arrest at his old residence as the Duke of L√ºeyang. Yuwen Hu summoned the high-level officials and informed them the situation, proposing to depose Emperor Xiaomin and replace him with Yuwen Yu. The high-level officials, not daring to oppose Yuwen Hu, agreed. Emperor Xiaomin's coconspirators were executed, while he himself was demoted to the rank of Duke of L√ºeyang. A month later, Yuwen Hu executed him and forced his wife, Princess Yuan, to become a Buddhist nun. After another brother of Emperor Xiaomin, Emperor Wu killed Yuwen Hu in 572, he posthumously honored Emperor Xiaomin as emperor and reburied him with honors due one.

Zulu medicinal plants: an inventory. University of Natal Press, Pietermaritzburg. Description It is a moderate to fast growing, mat-forming plant that features buxom, oval to round and deep green, opposite leaves, with one cultivar ('Purple Dragon') having purple undersides. The plant blooms in winter in its native habitat with white to pinkish starry flowers. It reaches an average height of 15 cm, but would reach 30 cm.Crassula multicava iGarden, Home of the Compulsive Gardener Cultivation Used as a groundcover, the plant is resistant to droughts and low temperatures above ‚àí3 ¬∞C. It also resists the lack of light and is a shade lover, but that can negatively affects its color or the quality of the flowers. Self-seeding, it can also be multiplied by cuttings. They also propagate themselves by producing plantlets on the flower head that fall off and grow into independent plants. Due to its small size, it can be grown in pots in well-composted, clay soils.Germishuizen, G. & Meyer, N.L. (eds) 2003. Plants of southern Africa: an annotated checklist. Strelitzia 14.

Talisman Saber involves joint exercises performed by the Australian Defence Force and the United States Military across six locations in northern and central Australia, the Coral Sea, and in Honolulu, Denver, and Suffolk, Va., though the bulk of the exercises are concentrated at the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area and other locations in northern and central Australia and Australia's territorial sea and exclusive economic zone. To reflect its bilateral nature, leadership of the exercise switches between Australia and the US every 2 years; primary leadership is reflected in the varied spelling of Saber/Sabre. The exercise focuses on crisis-action planning and contingency response, enhancing both nations‚Äô military capabilities to deal with regional contingencies and the War on Terrorism. Seven exercises have been held in the years 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.  Annual exercises  An Australian M1 Abrams tank during Exercise Talisman Sabre 2015 A US admiral describes participation in Talisman Sabre 2019 Talisman Saber 2005 was the inaugural exercise in this series, conducted 12‚Äì27 June 2005, in Shoalwater Bay, Rockhampton, Townsville, and the Coral Sea, with 16,000 US and Australian troops. Planning for the exercises began in early 2003, and the exercise was meant to combine elements from previous exercises Tandem Thrust, Kingfisher and Crocodile. During the exercise, U.S. Pacific Command and Australian Defense Force Joint Operations Command jointly executed more than 25 landing craft, air cushion (LCAC) trips and more than 1,300 Australian S-70A Blackhawk and MH-60S Knight Hawk landings and takeoffs. Talisman Sabre 2007 involved 26,000 US and Australian troops over 10 June ‚Äì 25 July. The exercise primarily took place at Shoalwater Bay, the Townsville Field Training Area, and the Bradshaw Field Training Area in central Queensland and in the Northern Territory. The exercise also involved the use of civilian airports including Sydney and Brisbane, and RAAF Base Amberley. A focal point of the exercises was a joint amphibious landing that involved the launch of more than 2,500 personnel from six ships early on 20 June. Talisman Saber 2009 was conducted 6‚Äì25 July 2009, with 10,000 Australian land and naval forces and 20,000 U.S. troops. The exercise was led by the United States and was conducted primarily at Shoalwater Bay and the Townsville Field Training Area. It involved various amphibious assault exercises and ship defense exercises. Talisman Sabre 2011 was conducted in July 2011 and was led by Australian forces. It incorporated \\"combined Special Forces operations, parachute drops, amphibious (marine) landings, land force manoeuvres, urban and air operations and the coordinated firing of live ammunition.\\" Talisman Saber 2013 saw MV-22s deployed to Australia for the first time.\\"20,000 US troops descend on Australia for training.\\" Involved approximately 21,000 US and 7,000 AUS personnel with Carrier Strike Group Five, Expeditionary Strike Group Seven, Royal Australian Navy, Royal Australian Air Force, and the . Talisman Sabre 2015 was conducted over 20 days from early to mid July 2015 and involved up to 30,000 US and Australian troops. It was the largest combined military exercise undertaken by the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Defence forces from New Zealand (500 personnel) and Japan (40 personnel) joined the exercise for the first time this year. The activities took place in the North Australian Range Complex (Bradshaw and Mount Bundy Training Areas and Delamere Air Weapons Range) and the East Australian Range Complex (Shoalwater Bay, Townsville and Cowley Beach Training Areas). A large-scale amphibious landing was also conducted at Fog Bay in the Northern Territory. Talisman Saber 2017 began in June 2017 and involved more than 33,000 Australian and US troops. Alongside the USS Bonhomme Richard, 20 other ships and over 200 aircraft took part in what was the countries' largest exercise to date. Personnel from New Zealand, Japan, and Canada were embedded within Australian and United States units. Talisman Sabre 2019 began in July 2019, with more than 34,000 personnel participating from 18 countries, including Australia, United States, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. The Exercise was officially launched on 8 July 2019 on board USS Ronald Reagan. Once again, the Chinese sent a Type 815G Dongdiao- class electronic surveillance ship to monitor the games like they did previously in 2017. The F-35B also made its debut in Australia during the exercise aboard USS Wasp. It was also the first time that both Canberra-class LHDs, HMAS Canberra and HMAS Adelaide, had operated together. Opposition and protests Protest during Exercise Talisman Sabre 2007 There have been regular protests against the exercises since 2007. There was opposition to Talisman Sabre 2007 from peace activists and a number of environmental groups, with environmental concerns ranging from general contamination, to the purported damaging effects of sonar on local marine life.Friends of the Earth produced a submission to the Maunsell Public Environment Report, which has been published online by Melbourne Indymedia, 13 November 2006. This submission details the environmental and social impact the war games will have. The Australian and American militaries have previously recognised the environmental concerns of operating in this area, with troops undergoing environmental impact briefings before arriving at the location in 2005, and an environmental training centre to be constructed before the 2007 exercise. United States Marines from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit train at Shoalwater Bay during Talisman Sabre 2007. In 2013 a number of protesters ventured into the live fire zone of the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. More protestors pledged to disrupt the exercises in 2015.  Environmental concerns  There have been concerns that depleted uranium munitions, which have been linked to increased incidence of cancer, posing significant health risks, have been used at the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area during Exercise Talisman Saber. Prior to the 2005 exercise the Australian Department of Defence issued a press release which stated that depleted uranium \\"will not be used in TS05 by either Australian or US forces\\" and that this was \\"unequivocal\\". This commitment was reiterated prior to Talisman Saber 2009. In 2013, the US Navy dropped at least two bombs into the sea after an exercise went wrong. Protesters claimed the bombs were hazardous to the Great Barrier Reef. The Australian government initially said the bombs were no threat and would remain where they were. But public pressure saw the US Navy retrieve the bombs.

Massy TGV is a new station, located in √éle-de-France, was built for the LGV Atlantique. Thus certain trains serve at Montparnasse Station and this station simultaneously, although it is not permitted to use the TGV to travel between those two stations.  Services  The proximity of station the Massy - Palaiseau RER station (one can even consider that Massy TGV is an extension of this station) makes it possible for this station to serve a great part of south Paris and its suburbs. The station also offers the advantage of enabling Lille‚ÄìTours(‚ÄìBordeaux) and Strasbourg-Tours(-Bordeaux) trains to serve Paris via the LGV Interconnexion Est without having to turn around at a terminus station (e.g. Gare de l'Est or Gare de Lyon). However, in spite of these advantages, the traffic of this station remains low.  History  On , Massy TGV was inaugurated by the SNCF. It had a total cost of 160 million Francs ( the equivalent to ‚Ç¨24.4 million). The station project first received the opposition of the SNCF and the local residents of Massy; the project was considered to be too close to Montparnasse station, in Paris, and a potential nuisance. The Ministry of Transport nevertheless pursued the project, as the station might avoid the suburban commuters having to travel through the capital with the RER C or B from Massy-Palaiseau. In 2007, works were launched in order to restructure the area and the station and better integration in Massy. This involves the construction of a footbridge which would link Massy TGV, Massy ‚Äì Palaiseau SNCF station, Massy ‚Äì Palaiseau RATP station. The end of the works, initially programmed for 2010, has been delayed by two years.

It was originally granted as a margravial holding of Guy Pallavicini by Boniface, first king of Thessalonica, in 1204. Its original purpose was to guard the pass of Thermopylae. The marquisate survived the fall of Thessalonica after the death of Boniface, but it was made subservient to the Principality of Achaea in 1248. The marquisate further survived the coming of the Catalan Company in 1311, but it fell to two Venetian families in quick succession: Cornaro (till 1335) and the Zorzi. Among the eighteen Catalan vassals of the area in 1380-1 the Margrave of Bodonitsa ranks third below Count Demitre and the Count of Salona. The Zorzi ruled the marquisate until the Ottoman Turks conquered it in 1414. Nicholas II continued to use the margravial title after that date, but the territory was never recovered.

He is also the subject of a popular buried treasure legend. History Marteen had been active in the Caribbean as early as 1651, and by 1663 had accepted a commission from Jamaican Governor Thomas to sail against the Spanish. In his barque Charity he may have joined Christopher Myngs for raids on Campeche, ignoring the cessation of hostilities between England and Spain. Although raids against the Spanish were prohibited under British law, he agreed in 1664 to join Henry Morgan's expedition and set sail from Port Royal along with John Morris and Captains Thomas Freeman and Jacob Fackman (or Jackman) under new letters of marque issued by Thomas‚Äôs successor Governor Thomas Modyford. After reaching the Grijalva River, Marteen and the others led their men 50 miles overland and successfully looted Tabasco and Villa Hermosa in a surprise raid. Returning to the coast, they discovered a Spanish patrol had captured their ships; after a brief battle, they managed to retake their two barques. They raided up the Yucatan, through Honduras, and into Nicaragua where they sacked Granada. Jackman and the others made their way back to Jamaica, arriving in Port Royal in late 1665. Marteen, however, did not. The Anglo-Dutch War was underway, and as the only Dutch commander in the expedition, Marteen feared he would be imprisoned if he stayed at Port Royal. After a brief visit he sailed to Tortuga by way of Guadeloupe and gave French officials information on Spanish defenses. He may have joined fellow Dutchman Edward Mansvelt to raid Costa Rica, and in 1666 again served under Modyford as a privateer. Modyford wrote, ‚Äúlately David Marteen, the best man of Tortuga, that has two frigates at sea, had promised to bring in both.‚Äù After 1668 he may have briefly joined Robert Searle to raid St. Augustine, though the Charity was busy hauling logwood. Modyford‚Äôs successor Thomas Lynch wrote in 1671 that ‚Äúthere are but three privateers out, one captain Diego, and Yhallahs and Martin.‚Äù The following year Charity was captured by John Morris and William Beeston, but by this time Francis Witherborn was in command: Charity had ‚Äúbeen formerly Captain David Martyn‚Äôs man o‚Äô war.‚Äù Marteen was still recorded as living in Port Royal as of 1672. Buried Treasure Local legends in Connecticut hold that Marteen sailed up the Farmington River near Salmon Brook in 1655, setting up a small camp. When accosted by locals, he and his buccaneers sailed away after burying an enormous amount of treasure they had looted in the Caribbean from the captured Spanish galleon Neptune. Other versions of the legend claim Marteen's corsairs established a small settlement which was wiped out during King Philip‚Äôs War' in 1676. Twentieth century treasure hunters claimed to have found carved stones used by Marteen‚Äôs crew to mark the burial site but the treasure itself, if real, has not been located.

In Gestalt psychology, Isomorphism is the idea that perception and the underlying physiological representation are similar because of related Gestalt qualities. Isomorphism refers to a correspondence between a stimulus array and the brain state created by that stimulus, and is based on the idea that the objective brain processes underlying and correlated with particular phenomenological experiences functionally have the same form and structure as those subjective experiences.Wertheimer, M. 2010. Isomorphism. Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology. 1‚Äì2.Kohler, W. (1920/1955). Die physischen Gestalten in Ruhe und im stationaren Zustand. Abridged trans. in W.D. Ellis (Ed.), A source book of gestalt psychology. (pp. 71-88). New York: The Humanities Press. (Original work published in 1920). Isomorphism can also be described as the similarity in the gestalt patterning of a stimulus and the activity in the brain while perceiving the stimulus. More generally, this concept is an expression of the materialist view that the properties of mind and consciousness are a direct consequence of the electrochemical interactions within the physical brain.Lehar, S. (1999). Gestalt Isomorphism and the Quantification of Spatial Perception. Gestalt Theory, 21(2). Retrieved November 1, 2012, from http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/isomorph/isomorph.html A commonly used example of isomorphism is the phi phenomenon, in which a row of lights flashing in sequence creates the illusion of motion. It is argued that the brain state created by this stimulus matches the brain state created by a patch of light moving from one location to another. The stimulus is perceived as motion because the subjective percept of spatial structure is correlated with electric fields in the brain whose spatial pattern mirrors the spatial structure in the perceived world.Luchins, A.

Upon her return, she witnessed the hanging of her father and brother by a rival political faction. She remarried and lived a life of pleasure and dissipation.Donovan, Stephen. \\"Blessed Clare of Rimini.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 16 July 2016 According to the Stephen Donovan, one day when she was 34, she attended Mass in the church of the Franciscan Friars, she seemed to hear a mysterious voice that bade her say an Our Father and a Hail Mary at least once with fervour and attention. Clare obeyed the command, not knowing from where it came, and then began to reflect upon her life. She decided to enter the Third Order of St. Francis, and became a model of every virtue, but especially of charity towards the destitute and afflicted. She abandoned her life of luxury and established a convent for a group of women under her direction.Delaney, John J., \\"Blessed Clare of rimini\\", Dictionary Of Saints, Image/Doubleday, 2005 When the Poor Clares were compelled to leave Regno on account of the prevailing wars, it was mainly through the exertions of Clare that they were able to obtain a convent and means of sustenance at Rimini. Later, Clare herself entered the order of Poor Clares nuns, along with several other pious women, and became superioress of the convent of Our Lady of the Angels at Rimini. She is believed to have worked numerous miracles and towards the close of her life to have been favored in an extraordinary manner with the gift of contemplation. Her body is now in the cathedral of Rimini. In 1784 the cult of Blessed Clare was approved by Pope Pius VI, who permitted her feast to be celebrated in the city and Diocese of Rimini on February 10. Critique In 1751 Giuseppe Garampi was appointed Prefect of the Vatican Archives. He published an anonymous fourteenth century vita of Clare of Rimini, which had served as the basis of subsequent biographies. Through the use of careful philological and historical analysis he disputed that Clare had been a Franciscan tertiary and later a Poor Clare. He also argued against her having founded the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rimini. Garampi described her as similar to a Beguine, and was a devout laywoman who dressed in a religious habit and practiced poverty and penance, but never took vows or was under a rule. With the details of her vita disputed, the promotion of her cultus to canonization effectively ended.Women and Faith: Catholic Religious Life in Italy from Late Antiquity to the Present, (Lucetta Scaraffia, Gabriella Zarri, eds.)

The chant is made up of the phrase \\"Rock chalk, Jayhawk, KU\\". History The chant was first adopted by the university's science club in 1886. Chemistry professor E.H.S. Bailey and his colleagues were returning by train to Lawrence after a conference. During their travel, they discussed a need of a rousing yell. They came up with \\"Rah, Rah, Jayhawk, Go KU\\", repeated three times, which later became \\"Rock Chalk Jayhawk Go KU\\". By 1889, \\"Rock Chalk\\"‚Äîa transposition of chalk rock, a type of limestone, that exists in the Cretaceous-age bedrocks of central and western parts of the state, which is similar to the coccolith-bearing chalk of the white cliffs of Dover‚Äîlater replaced the two \\"rahs.\\" (The University itself is located on top of Mount Oread, a ridge of flinty Carboniferous limestone used in some of the buildings.) Those responsible for the change are unknown, with Bailey himself crediting the geology department, and others an English professor. Kansas troops used it in the Philippine-American War in 1899, the Boxer Rebellion, and World War II. In the 1911 Border War football game, over 1,000 fans gathered in downtown Lawrence to listen to a \\"broadcast\\" of the game by telegraph and participated in cheers including the Rock Chalk. In the 1920 Summer Olympics, Albert I of Belgium asked for a typical American college yell, and gathered athletes replied with the chant. Former United States President Theodore Roosevelt called the Rock Chalk chant the best college chant he ever heard. Usage Fans have used the phrase \\"Rock Chalk\\" in creative ways, such as Rock \\"Chocolate\\" Jayhawk ice cream. It is best known as being loudly chanted at basketball games at Allen Fieldhouse and football games at University of Kansas Memorial Stadium. During pregame, the refrain of \\"Rock chalk...

It is usually preceded by the Kansas alma mater \\"Crimson and the Blue,‚Äù and followed by the fight song, \\"I'm a Jayhawk.‚Äù Since the early 1990s, Kansas fans have been known to do the slow repetition of \\"Rock chalk...

He was a war correspondent and the author of 17 novels and numerous short stories. Biography Just was born in Michigan City, Indiana, attended Lake Forest Academy, and subsequently graduated from Cranbrook School in 1953. He briefly attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He started his career as a print journalist for the Waukegan (Illinois) News-Sun. He married three times and had three children. War Correspondent After covering the war in Cyprus (1957) and the conflict in the Dominican Republic for Newsweek, Benjamin Bradlee hired Just at The Washington Post as a war correspondent for the Vietnam war. He published close to 400 articles, many appearing on the front page. He was wounded in June 1966, but returned to Saigon for a second tour after recovering in Washington, D.C. Leaving Saigon in May, 1967, he wrote To What End: Report from Vietnam, credited as being an important element to helping the nation understand the futility war. He went on to cover the presidential campaigns of both Eugene McCarthy and Richard Nixon for the Post in 1968 and was then asked to join its editorial board. Fiction Writing Just's influences included Henry James and Ernest Hemingway. His novel An Unfinished Season was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2005. His novel Echo House was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1997. He was twice a finalist for the O. Henry Award and won the prize in 1985 for his short story About Boston. He was Spring 1999 Rome Prize fellow. His fiction is often concerned with the influence of national politics on Americans' personal lives. Much of it is set in Washington D.C. and foreign countries. Another common theme is the alienation felt by Midwesterners in the East. According to Washington Post book critic Jonathan Yardley, Just's finest novels are A Family Trust, An Unfinished Season, Exiles in the Garden, and American Romantic. He also lists Just's short story collection, The Congressman Who Loved Flaubert, as one of his favorite books. Yardley recently wrote that \\"American Romantic may well be the best of them all.\\" Literary Hub in 2018 wrote that \\"Ward Just is not merely America‚Äôs best political novelist.

Yuan Humo was the fifth daughter of Emperor Wen of Western Wei, and she carried the title Princess Jin'an during the reigns of her father and her brothers Emperor Fei of Western Wei and Emperor Gong of Western Wei. Sometime after Yuwen Jue, the son and heir of then-paramount general Yuwen Tai, was created the Duke of L√ºeyang in 550, she married Yuwen Jue as his duchess. After Yuwen Tai died in 556, Yuwen Jue inherited his titles, under the guardianship of Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu. In spring 557, Yuwen Hu forced Duchess Yuan's brother Emperor Gong to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou. Emperor Xiaomin, then carrying the title of Heavenly Prince, created her as his princess. Later in 557, Emperor Xiaomin, unhappy about Yuwen Hu's hold on power, tried to have him killed. The news of the plot leaked, and Yuwen Hu deposed Emperor Xiaomin and replaced him with another son of Yuwen Tai, Emperor Ming. Soon, he had Yuwen Jue put to death. He also forced Princess Yuan to become a Buddhist nun. After another brother of Emperor Xiaomin, Emperor Wu killed Yuwen Hu in 572, he posthumously honored Emperor Xiaomin as emperor and honored her as empress, housing her at Chongyi Palace (Â¥áÁæ©ÂÆÆ).

The company officers were brothers C. Jared Ingersoll, industrialist, as president, and John H. W. Ingersoll, attorney and industrialist, as vice president and treasurer. The Muskogee Company owned large interests in several railroads in and about northeastern Oklahoma. According to a historical summary written by the DeGolyer Library at Southern Methodist University, which holds the archives of the Muskogee Company, the company history actually began in the 1890s, when a group of Philadelphia businessmen, headed by C. J. Ingersoll, built the Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad (CO&G;), which ran from Hartford, Arkansas to McAlester, Oklahoma (then known as Indian Territory). These men intended the railroad to serve their coal mines in Arkansas, the most notable of which were:the Sebastian County Coal & Mining Co., American Smokeless Coal Co., Mazzrad Coal & Mining Co., and Garland Coal & Mining Co.\\"Muskogee Company records (Part 1) A Guide to the Collection.\\" Accessed November 13, 2016. In 1902, Ingersoll's group sold the CO&G; to a competitor and began the Midland Valley Railroad, which would run from Ft. Smith, Arkansas to Wichita, Kansas. The route was to go northwest from Ft. Smith through Muskogee, Tulsa and the Osage Nation into Kansas, where there were other coal interests. Coal shipments from company- owned mines to colder western regions of the United States via the Muskogee Company-owned Midland Valley was the original plan for profit. Oil discoveries in Oklahoma later produced lucrative revenues for the Muskogee Company railroads that were strategically located in high production areas of the state. The railroads that fell under the control and common management of the Muskogee Company were colloquially referred to as the Muskogee Roads. The Muskogee Roads were made up of the Midland Valley Railroad, the Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf Railway, the Oklahoma City-Ada-Atoka Railway, and indirectly, the Osage Railway. C. Jared Ingersoll was a majority owner of the Midland Valley since its beginning on February 1, 1903, but the Muskogee Company took ownership of the line after its 1923 formation. The Osage Railway, which was affiliated but independently owned and operated, was built during the early 1920s to accommodate traffic from the oil fields located in the Osage Nation. The Kansas, Oklahoma and Gulf was in receivership when acquired by the Muskogee Company in 1926. Finally, the Oklahoma City-Ada-Atoka Railway was purchased by the Muskogee Company in 1929, at which point the Ingersoll interests owned and operated four different railways with a total of 756 miles of trackage. The Osage Railroad was abandoned in 1953. In 1963, the Texas & Pacific, which was a subsidiary of the Missouri Pacific Railroad, acquired the other three lines. The Oklahoma City-Ada-Atoka was sold to the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe that same year, while the others were consolidated into the Texas & Pacific. Citation  References  * Lloyd E. Stagner. 1996.

After unloading, the firearm is aimed into the barrel and dry fired. It is constructed so as to safely contain a fired bullet in case the operator mistakenly left the weapon loaded. Dry firing is the practice of simulating the discharge of a firearm without any live ammunition, or practicing with an inert laser/infrared training platform such as an iMarksman or SIRT training pistol, and may also include the use of a target/feedback system, such as the iDryfire or LASR software. Dry fire does not pose any real risk of damage to most modern centerfire firearms; however, it can for rimfire weapons, where the firing pin in most designs will impact the breech face if the weapon is dry-fired. Because of this, precautions (such as the use of snap caps) need to be taken if such a weapon is to be deliberately dry-fired. Benefits There are many benefits to dry firing. Learning is faster and can be safer with dry fire, and it's easier to practice trigger control without developing a flinch, which is a pre-emptive reflex some beginners develop due to being unaccustomed to the trigger weight or anticipating a recoil. Dry fire also allows shooters to practice trigger control in locations where they couldn't practice with live ammo. Grip, drawing, sight alignment, trigger control, reloads, troubleshooting malfunctions, and more can be trained during dry fire practice. The technique allows people to conduct a safe, economical form of training to improve their shooting skills. An emphasis is placed on safety to prevent an accidental discharge. Training should be conducted in an area with no ammunition and with a suitable backstop.Dry Fire Training web.archive.org In recent years, a number of companies have developed methods of enhancing dry fire practice to improve skills. Products that illuminate a laser beam, as opposed to a solid projectile, have become increasingly popular. These include chamber inserts available for various caliber firearms, as well as dedicated training pistols or replacement AR-15 bolt carrier groups. There are also a number of target systems for these laser dry fire training aides, that are becoming more affordable and popular. These products help people get more from dry fire practice by providing feedback on shot placement and times, and make dry fire a more enjoyable experience. In addition, there are training aids such as training cards that provide shooters a variety of drills to do that will help them develop skills that will carry over to live fire. Considerations It is generally acceptable to dry fire more modern centerfire firearms without a cartridge or snap cap for limited volume training. Older designs such as the CZ 52 and Colt Single Action Army are exceptions. However, dry firing a rimfire firearm, striker based firearms or guns with angled firing pins (such as revolvers with hammer-mounted firing pins or older shotguns) can damage the gun. Furthermore, damage can occur to the chamber mouth of a rimfire firearm. Ultimately, one should check with the manufacturer of the gun to ascertain if it is safe to dry fire, but a snap cap should be used for all high-volume dry fire training where the firing pin articulates.  In archery  Dry firing in archery, also known as \\"dry loosing\\", refers to the releasing of a drawn bow without an arrow. This practice should be avoided as much as possible, because without the mass of the arrow to absorb the elastic energy released, the energy is instead dissipated through vibration of the bowstring and the bow limbs, and can do significant structural damage to the bow itself. Compound bows are particularly susceptible to damage due to high tension and numerous moving parts. Dry firing a modern high-poundage compound bow even once may cause a combination of cracked limbs, bent axles, string derailment, cam warpage, string/cable failure, cable slide failure, and can even cause the bow to shatter. While some bows can survive a dry fire with no apparent damage, typically manufacturers do not warrant their bows for dry firing, and any bow that has been dry fired needs to be thoroughly inspected for damage before shooting again. In particular, the limbs need to be inspected for cracking around cam axles and the opening of the slot where the cams or pulleys fit in (since they tend to tilt sideways during a dry fire). Crossbows, with their high draw weights, are even more likely to be damaged by dry firing. Etymology Recorded from the 1980s, Drill sergeant course: weapons, U.S. Department of the Army (1984), p. 1. the term \\"dry fire\\" was possibly coined as analogous to the phrase \\"dry run\\", which is a rehearsal or testing process and in the case of the firearm, one is \\"testing\\" the trigger action and observing the hammer or striker drop, without using live ammunition. For the expression of \\"dry run\\", it has been suggested that the \\"dry\\" originates from exhibitions by late-19th-century fire departments in the United States, where drills (runs) were conducted for public viewing without the use of water (dry).

Rare or complex medical conditions from all over New Zealand may get referred here. The hospital is closely associated with Starship Children's Health, a separate subsidiary facility on the same grounds, located just to the northwest of the City Hospital. To secure the best quality possible around the clock, in 2005 there was commissioned a 3,600 kW (3.6 MW) emergency power generation system. This amount for 710 beds is a high one and the hospital can continue all work going on with that much capacity. History Previous buildings Auckland Hospital, 1910 Originally, a timber hospital occupied the Auckland City Hospital site from 1846 to 1877, providing four wards of 10 beds each, and having been designed by Frederick Thatcher, the architect of the St Mary's Church in Parnell. The hospital treated both Europeans and MƒÅori, though the diseases were different, with the Pakeha treated mostly for the effects of alcohol abuse, while the MƒÅori came for tuberculosis and rheuma treatment. Thomas Moore Philson was superintendent of the hospital from 1859 to 1883. In 1877, a new building in an Italianate style was constructed for ¬£25,000, designed by Philip Herepath, architect to the provincial government. Administered by T M Philson, the new hospital became known for taking on many charity cases but, partly in response, was also continually understaffed and overcrowded. There were also complaints about the limited training of the staff, which changed only with the hiring of a new matron, Miss Crisp, in 1883. Having trained in the new tradition of Florence Nightingale, she is credited with turning the hospital from an 'old men with alcoholism institution' into a real hospital and instituting real nurse training. Current buildings The older part of Auckland City Hospital, now the support building, as seen from the Auckland Domain. Visible in front is the smokestack of the complex's central heating. The Herepath building was demolished in 1964 to make way for a new structure designed by architects Stephenson & Turner, which was completed in 1967, and still remains.Auckland Hospital (from the Grafton Residents Association website) During the health reforms of the New Zealand health system in the early 1990s, Auckland Hospital was run as a business - in the model of state-owned enterprises of New Zealand, i.e. with the instruction to return a profit. In accordance with this policy, Auckland Hospital was officially known as Auckland Crown Health Enterprise.

Bleckley entered service as a member of the Kansas National Guard, was commissioned as an artillery officer, then volunteered for aviation training and duty. His was one of four Medals of Honor awarded to members of the Air Service. Background Erwin Bleckley was born in Wichita, Kansas.Kansapedia: Erwin Bleckley, Kansas Historical Society Enlistment and Air Service duty Erwin Bleckley after joining the Kansas National Guard On June 6, 1917, Bleckley, then a bank teller with the 4th National Bank of Wichita, enlisted as a private in the Kansas National Guard, joining Battery F, 1st Field Artillery, the second man to enlist, according to the unit commander. On July 5, 1917, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery. A month later, on August 5, his unit was called into Federal service. The 1st Field Artillery was then reorganized into the 130th Field Artillery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, as part of the 35th Division, National Guard. Bleckley had expressed a desire to become a pilot, but his family objected and he became an artilleryman. When he arrived in France in March 1918, the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force, then organizing, announced a need for artillery officers to train as aerial observers. Bleckley volunteered, graduated from the observer school at Tours, France, and was attached to the 50th Aero Squadron on August 14, 1918. At that time the 50th, known as the \\"Dutch Girl\\" squadron from the commercial logo of a scouring cleanser painted on the sides of their airplanes, was based at Amanty aerodrome and had 14 pilots, nine observers including Bleckley, and 18 de Havilland DH-4 aircraft, which the crews called \\"Libertys\\" after their American-made Liberty engines. On September 2, 1918, in preparation for the St. Mihiel Offensive, the squadron moved to Behonne aerodrome, near Bar-le-Duc to support the V Corps of the First U.S. Army. However a few days later they were shifted to Bicqueley aerodrome, to provide support to the 82nd and 90th Divisions of the I Corps. While arriving at their new base, the squadron lost a pilot and mechanic killed in a landing accident. Bleckley, known as \\"Bleck\\" and popular in his squadron, flew his first combat mission at 5:30 a.m. Of September 12, 1918, the first day of the offensive, which was the first coordinated, large-scale employment of Air Service airpower. Flying observer for flight leader 1st Lt. Harold E. \\"Dad\\" Goettler in aircraft number 2, the mission supported the advance of the 90th Division, and was the first of several that resulted in a recommendation for promotion to 1st lieutenant for Bleckley on September 17. The Lost Battalion Second Lt. Erwin R. Bleckley, a U.S. Army Air Service observer On September 24, the squadron again relocated, this time to Remicourt, aerodrome of the I Corps Observation Group. On September 26, 1918, supporting the 77th Division, the 50th Aero Squadron flew its first missions of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive with a complement of 15 pilots, 15 observers, and 16 Liberties. At the beginning of October, units of the 308th Infantry Regiment were cut off and surrounded by German troops. Able to communicate with division headquarters only by carrier pigeon, the battalion-sized force inadvertently supplied division headquarters with incorrect coordinates of its location. As early as October 2 the 50th Aero Squadron searched for signs of the cut-off battalion, and on October 5, the division commander, Maj. Gen. Robert Alexander, requested that the 50th Aero Squadron locate and resupply the \\"Lost Battalion\\" by air with ammunition, rations, and medical supplies. Four attempts to pinpoint the location were unsuccessful in increasingly bad weather. On October 6, the 50th flew 13 additional missions, ultimately having three aircraft shot down, in what the USAF has termed the first combat airlift in history.Fricano, Lt. Col. Michael (1996). The Evolution of Airlift Doctrine and Organization, Air University, maxwell AFB, Alabama, p. 7. In addition to supplies, the 50th attempted to drop two baskets of carrier pigeons to the 308th, using small parachutes from flares to soften the descent. The first resupply mission, flown by Lt.s Floyd M. Pickrell and Alfred C. George, took off shortly before noon in poor visibility. The DH-4 of Lt.s Maurice F. Graham and James E. McCurdy returned from the last mission with McCurdy seriously wounded by a bullet through the neck, but also with confirmation that the location given by the lost battalion was incorrect and occupied by German forces. Medal of Honor mission On the early afternoon of October 6, 1918, flying again with Goettler, Bleckley took off to try to locate the \\"Lost Battalion\\". After completion of their first mission, they returned to Remicourt with numerous holes in the aircraft from small arms fire, and problems with their spark plugs that had been plaguing the DH-4s for several days. Warned by squadron commander Capt. Daniel P. Morse that a second sortie would be exceedingly more difficult and hazardous, Bleckley was quoted: \\"We'll make the delivery or die in the attempt!\\" Late in the afternoon, the pair flew a second resupply mission in aircraft number 6, borrowed from Lt. Pickrell when their own was not serviceable. A history of Wichita, Bear Grease, Builders, and Bandits by Beccy Tanner (1991), gives eyewitness descriptions of what followed: \\"Goettler skidded his plane, he made turns, he side-slipped a little occasionally, he climbed and then dived. Each time the plane turned and its great mottled belly flopped back into normal position, the men of the lost battalion expected to see it tumble from the sky... But on its way it went like a charmed thing, roaring up and down and across, rocked occasionally by the ash of big shells that had just passed... the plane finally crashed into the French terrain.\\" The DH-4 flew low, just above the tree tops, cresting hilltops and descending into a ravine in which the Germans could shoot down at the aircraft. The attempt to draw fire to pinpoint German positions would help find the battalion by the process of elimination. By flying low the attempts to drop supplies into an area 350 by 50 yards where the battalion was believed to be dug in would be more precise. Even so, much of the resupply was recovered by German troops, and the aircraft came under intense and accurate fire from German machineguns and rifles. Goettler was struck in the head by a bullet and killed. The DH-4 crashed inside Allied lines, and Bleckley was thrown from the plane and severely injured. Unconscious, he was rescued by French soldiers, and rushed by automobile to a hospital, but died en route of internal injuries suffered in the crash. Morse successfully recommended both men for the Distinguished Service Cross, two of the six received by aviators of the squadron. The awards were upgraded to the Medal of Honor by the Decoration Board in 1922. The medal was presented to Bleckley's parents at the Wichita Forum on March 23, 1923. Maj. Gen. C. B. Duncan, commander of the 7th Corps Area, pinned the medal on the lapel of Bleckley's father, Col. Elmer E. Bleckley, a former railroad agent with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and Vice President of the 4th National Bank. The Kansas National Guard was presented with a painting of the DH-4 and Bleckley moments after the crash, which depicts him as conscious but near death, handing a bloody paper containing the location of the Lost Battalion to French soldiers. However the version appears to be part of the Lost Battalion mythology with no evidence to date to support it. Commemoration Lt. Erwin Bleckley exhibit at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force Bleckley was commemorated by the city of Wichita in 1932 with the naming of Bleckley Drive, at the request of the American Legion. Following the war, his remains were permanently buried in the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial east of the village of Romagne-sous-Montfaucon, France. Bleckley's family donated his Medal of Honor to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The original copy of the award document is located in the Museum of the Kansas National Guard in Topeka, KS along with other personal momentoes and personal items belonging to Lt. Bleckley. A monument commemorating Bleckley and Goettler's final flight was erected on October 7, 2009, in Remicourt, ninety-one years and one day after they were killed.

In the 15th century the term mtavari was applied only to the five ruling princes of western Georgia (Samtskhe, Mingrelia, Guria, Svaneti, and Abkhazia),Suny, p. 44. whose autonomous powers were finally eliminated under Imperial Russia.

They developed software for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS in several languages and sold it in over a dozen countries. History Edmark was founded in 1970 by Gordon B.Bleil by combining the assets of Educational Aids and Services Co. a small supplier of educational materials and programs and L-Tec Systems Inc. which had developed programs from its research. The Child Development and Mental Retardation Center of the University of Washington under the direction of Dr. Sidney Bijou had conducted research into the operant conditioning and reinforcement theories of B.F. Skinner as applicable to human learning. From this research they developed academic programs which for the first time proved the viability of teaching reading to people with severe mental limitations. Bleil adapted this research into The Edmark Reading Program which for the next decade was the principal product of the company. Bleil left the company to return to banking in 1980 and retained no interest in the company. They began developing software in 1992. Edmark was listed on NASDAQ. Their audience was children between the ages of 2 and 16 years. Edmark had more than 65 industry design awards. In 1989, their children, Richard, Lucy, Heather and Chris became directors. Richard became the chairman, Heather became the CCO, Chris became the president and Lucy became the CEO in October 1989. Edmark hired former teacher Donna Stanger as vice-president of product development in October 1991. In 1992, Edmark released Millie's Math House and KidDesk. Sally Narodick resigned as CEO in September citing the stress, and Donna Stanger became the CEO Edmark was acquired by IBM on November 13, 1996 for $102.3 million ($15.50 per share for two-thirds of Edmark's shares) to expand its presence in home software.

GCA provides a medium through which independent garden centers may consider their mutual problems and interests, exchange ideas and assist each other in bringing the independent garden center industry to a higher level of efficiency. GCA Summer Tour-goers bring back retailing inspirations from touring indie garden centers in San Francisco, CA. Regular members are limited to independent retail firms to whose primary purpose is to sell live plants to the public. Active members must have a definite location of business with appropriate facilities to properly care for and display plants. GCA puts on a summer tour of garden centers in different regions of the United States each year in June. Recent history has taken the tour to Nashville, TN; Seattle, WA; Norfolk/Virginia Beach, VA; Portland, OR; Milwaukee, WI; San Francisco, CA; central Ohio and Detroit, MI. GCA's commitment is to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the locally owned independent garden center. GCA is the primary forum for information, education and training that promotes the exchange of ideas between member firms. In October 2016, GCA had 144 active member firms and 22 associate members with a sincere interest in improving the business of retailing in garden centers.  Awards  Every year, GCA hosts the Best Garden Center Bathroom Awards recognizing independent garden centers with the best store restroom designs. A panel judges the entries based on the bathroom's creativity and comfort to the customer's overall shopping experience. The best entries are selected and given one of these honors: Gold Award, Silver Award and Merit Award.

One part of that agreement required that potential members of GCA would be required to first be a member of the AAN. In February 2002, the Board of ANLA voted to terminate the relationship since they were unable to come to an agreement with GCA on the future direction of that relationship. In 2002, GCA contracted with Clayton W. Hannon (the retired Executive Director of the Oregon Association of Nurserymen, now the Oregon Association of Nurseries) to manage GCA on an interim basis. In April 2005, management was moved to the Association Services Group (ASG) in LaGrange, Georgia. GCA endorsed the Independent Garden Center Show and helped with its educational program. In April 2012, GCA ended its contract with ASG, unable to meet the financial obligations of its management contract, and signed an exclusive agreement with IGC Show founders to carry on GCA programs and activities under the IGC banner led by Jeff and Cheryl Morey, whose independent garden center dedicated entities include the IGC Show. Strengthened by the independent vision and reach of the IGC banner, Garden Centers of America, LLC, operates independently as a separate entity under the GCA name. The GCA board will act as the group's Leadership Council, providing valuable insights to make GCA even more relevant to its membership through expanded programs and offerings sponsored by IGC.

Trombert (eds.), Les Sogdiens en Chine, Paris, 2005, p. 52 formally Duke Dang of Jin (ÊôâËï©ÂÖ¨), was a regent of the Xianbei dynasty Northern Zhou in China. He first came into prominence as the nephew of Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai, and after Yuwen Tai's death in 556, he became the guardian to Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue. In 557, he forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue (Emperor Xiaomin), establishing Northern Zhou. However, Yuwen Hu dominated the political scene, and after Emperor Xiaomin tried to seize power later that year, he killed Emperor Xiaomin and replaced him with another son of Yuwen Tai, Emperor Ming. In 560, he poisoned Emperor Ming, who was succeeded by another son of Yuwen Tai, Emperor Wu. In 572, Emperor Wu ambushed Yuwen Hu and killed him, personally taking power.  Background  Yuwen Hu was born in 513 as a son of Yuwen Hao (ÂÆáÊñáÈ°•), a son of the local peasant leader Yuwen Gong (ÂÆáÊñáËÇ±) at Wuchuan (Ê≠¶Â∑ù, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). His mother was Lady Yan, who was probably Yuwen Hao's wife. He was said to be particularly bright as a child and was favored by Yuwen Gong. In 524, with Northern Wei's northern provinces engulfed in peasant rebellions, Yuwen Gong and his sons, along with another local leader, Heba Duba (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂ∫¶Êãî) and his sons, led a counter-rebellion against one of the major rebels, Poliuhan Baling (Á†¥ÂÖ≠ÈüìÊãîÈôµ), who had taken Wuchuan earlier, and they killed Poliuhan's general Wei Kegu (Ë°õÂèØÂ≠§), temporarily restoring order. However, soon Yuwen Gong and his sons were forced to flee and join the army of another rebel leader, Xianyu Xiuli (ÈÆÆ‰∫é‰øÆÁ¶Æ). It was while serving under Xianyu that Yuwen Gong died in battle, and it was probably also at the same time that Yuwen Hao died as well. After Xianyu Xiuli was killed by his general Yuan Hongye (ÂÖÉÊ¥™Ê•≠) in 526, another general, Ge Rong (ËëõÊ¶Æ), in turn killed Yuan and took over Xianyu's troops, and Yuwen Hu stayed with his uncles in Ge's army. In 528, after Ge was defeated by Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong, Erzhu forcibly moved Ge's troops, including the Yuwens, to his power base at Jinyang (ÊôâÈôΩ, in modern Taiyuan, Shandong), where he remained for several years. In 531 or 532, when Yuwen Hu's uncle Yuwen Tai was serving under the general Heba Yue (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂ≤≥, Heba Duba's son) in the western provinces, Yuwen Hu went to join Yuwen Tai at Pingliang. (When he did so, he left both his mother Lady Yan and his aunt (Yuwen Hao's sister) at Jinyang.) As Yuwen Tai had no sons at that point,The Book of Zhou actually stated, \\"The sons of Taizu [Yuwen Tai's temple name] were all young at that point,\\" but Yuwen Tai's oldest son Yuwen Yu was not born until 534. Presumably, the Book of Zhou was including the several years thereafter, not just this particular year. when he was out on military campaigns, he entrusted his household to Yuwen Hu. Yuwen Hu was said not to be strict as the household's governor but was nevertheless able to keep the household organized and solemn. Yuwen Tai, when he saw this, stated, \\"this child's ambitions and talents are like mine.\\" In 533, when Heba added the strategically important Xia Province (Â§èÂ∑û, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi) to the ones he controlled, he made Yuwen Tai its governor. Yuwen Tai left Yuwen Hu to serve under Heba. When Heba's associate Houmochen Yue (‰æØËé´Èô≥ÊÇÖ) assassinated Heba in early 534, Heba's generals invited Yuwen Tai to serve as their commander, and he agreed. In the subsequent armed confrontation with Houmochen (in which Yuwen Tai defeated Houmochen, causing Houmochen to commit suicide), Yuwen Hu served as one of his uncle's generals.  During Western Wei  In 534, displeased at the control that the paramount general Gao Huan had on the military, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei entered into an alliance with Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (Ë≥ÄÊãîÂãù, Heba Yue's brother), who controlled the southern provinces. When Gao realized this, he marched on the capital Luoyang, and Emperor Xiaowu decided to flee to Yuwen Tai's territory, sending messengers informing Yuwen Tai of his decision. Yuwen Hu was part of the army that Yuwen Tai sent to escort Emperor Xiaowu to Yuwen Tai's headquarters at Chang'an, commanded by the general Li Xian (ÊùéË≥¢). For his participation in protecting the emperor, Yuwen Hu was created the Count of Shuichi. Later in 534, when Emperor Xiaowu refused to return to Luoyang despite requests by Gao, Gao declared Yuan Shanjian, the son of Emperor Xiaowu's cousin Yuan Dan (ÂÖÉ‰∫∂), emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), and moved the capital to Yecheng (ÈÑ¥Âüé, in modern Handan, Hebei), thus dividing Northern Wei into two‚ÄîWestern Wei, with Emperor Xiaowu as emperor and its capital at Chang'an, and Eastern Wei, with Emperor Xiaojing as emperor. During the reign of Emperor Xiaowu's cousin and successor Emperor Wen of Western Wei, Yuwen Hu received a number of promotions, and he also had a number of accomplishments in the battlefield. He was created a duke. In 543, though, he was nearly killed in a battle at Luoyang and was only saved from capture or death by his subordinates Hou Fu (‰æØ‰ºè) and Hou Long'en (‰æØÈæçÊÅ©). Yuwen Tai removed him from his posts, but soon returned him to those posts. In 546, he was created the greater title of Duke of Zhongshan. In 549, when Yuwen Tai sent the general Yu Jin (‰∫éË¨π) to launch a major attack on Liang Dynasty's capital Jiangling, Yuwen Hu served as Yu's lieutenant. The Western Wei army was able to capture Jiangling and put Emperor Yuan of Liang to death, declaring his nephew Emperor Xuan of Western Liang as Liang's emperor instead (albeit controlling only the Jiangling region, known in history as the Western Liang). For this accomplishment, Yuwen Hu's son Yuwen Hui (ÂÆáÊñáÊúÉ) was created the Duke of Jiangling. in fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the norther provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (ÁâΩÂ±ØÂ±±, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned Yuwen Hu to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and his heir apparent Yuwen Jue took over his titles, while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state. (The senior generals and officials, who obeyed Yuwen Tai as effectively the first among equals, were initially reluctant to follow the leadership of the younger Yuwen Hu, only doing so after Yu Jin, previously Yuwen Hu's commanding general, declared his support on the basis that Yuwen Hu was the senior member of the Yuwen clan.) Around the new year 557, believing that Yuwen Jue, who was 14 at this time, needed to have his authority affirmed through an imperial title, Yuwen Hu had Emperor Gong of Western Wei (Emperor Wen's son) yield the throne to Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou.  During Emperor Xiaomin's reign  Yuwen Jue took the throne (as Emperor Xiaomin), but did not use the title \\"emperor\\" (ÁöáÂ∏ù, hu√°ng d√¨), using instead the Zhou Dynasty-style title \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang). He created Yuwen Hu the greater title of Duke of Jin. The political situation, with Yuwen Hu as regent, was unstable. About a month after Emperor Xiaomin took the throne, two of the most senior officials, Zhao Gui (Ë∂ôË≤¥) the Duke of Chu and Dugu Xin the Duke of Wei, showed signs of displeasure about Yuwen Hu's hold on power. Zhao wanted to kill Yuwen Hu, an action that Dugu tried to persuade him against. Soon thereafter, however, Zhao's plans were revealed by another official, Yuwen Sheng (ÂÆáÊñáÁõõ), and Yuwen Hu had Zhao executed and removed Dugu from his office. Soon, he also forced Dugu to commit suicide. When another official, Qi Gui (ÈΩäËªå), criticized Yuwen Hu's regency, he was also executed. Meanwhile, Emperor Xiaomin himself, wanting to take power, was engaging in a plot to kill Yuwen Hu. His plot included two of Yuwen Tai's key associates, Li Zhi (ÊùéÊ§ç) and Sun Heng (Â≠´ÊÅÜ), as well as the other officials Yifu Feng (‰πôÂºóÈ≥≥) and Heba Ti (Ë≥ÄÊãîÊèê), each of whom was ambitious and therefore further tried to fan Emperor Xiaomin's suspicions against Yuwen Hu. After Li tried to engage another official, Zhang Guangluo (ÂºµÂÖâÊ¥õ) in the plot, however, Zhang revealed the plot to Yuwen Hu. Yuwen Hu, not wanting to take drastic actions at first, sent Li and Sun away to be provincial governors. When Emperor Xiaomin wanted to summon Li and Sun back to the capital Chang'an, Yuwen Hu urged against it, pledging his loyalty. However, Yifu and Heba became fearful and plotted to carry out the plot anyway. Zhang again informed Yuwen Hu, who discussed the matter with the generals Helan Xiang (Ë≥ÄËò≠Á••) and Yuchi Gang (Â∞âÈÅ≤Á∂±). Helan suggested to him to depose Emperor Xiaomin, and Yuwen Hu had Yuchi arrest Yifu and Heba and disband the imperial guards. Emperor Xiaomin, surprised by the move, barricaded himself in the palace and armed his ladies in waiting and eunuchs. Yuwen Hu sent Helan into the palace to force Emperor Xiaomin to leave the palace and put him under house arrest at his old residence as the Duke of L√ºeyang. Yuwen Hu summoned the high-level officials and informed them the situation, proposing to depose Emperor Xiaomin and replace him with Emperor Xiaomin's older brother Yuwen Yu the Duke of Ningdu (who was not named heir by Yuwen Tai because his mother Lady Yao was a concubine). The high-level officials, not daring to oppose Yuwen Hu, agreed. Emperor Xiaomin's coconspirators were executed, while he himself was demoted to the rank of Duke of L√ºeyang. A month later, Yuwen Hu executed him and forced his wife, Princess Yuan, to become a Buddhist nun. Soon thereafter, Yuwen Yu arrived at Chang'an and took the throne (as Emperor Ming), still using the title of Heavenly Prince.  During Emperor Ming's reign  Emperor Ming continued to honor Yuwen Hu with greater titles and honor, and in 558, he created Yuwen Hu's son Yuwen Zhi (ÂÆáÊñáËá≥) the Duke of Chongye. In spring 559, Yuwen Hu formally returned his authorities to Emperor Ming, and Emperor Ming began to formally rule on all governmental matters, but Yuwen Hu retained authority over the military. In 559, Emperor Ming began to use the title of emperor. in summer 560, Yuwen Hu, apprehensive of Emperor Ming's intelligence and abilities, instructed the imperial chef Li An (ÊùéÂÆâ) to poison sugar cookies that were submitted to the emperor. Emperor Ming ate them and became ill. Knowing that he was near death, he instructed that, because his sons were young, the throne should be passed to his younger brother Yuwen Yong the Duke of Lu. He died soon thereafter, and Yuwen Yong took the throne as Emperor Wu. Yuwen Hu again took control of both political and military matters.  During Emperor Wu's reign  Emperor Wu did all he could to appear to honor Yuwen Hu in all things, speaking little and not interfering with Yuwen Hu's decisions. During meetings that Emperor Wu's mother Empress Dowager Chinu would have with Yuwen Hu, she would instruct Yuwen Hu to sit at the table with her, while Emperor Wu, as the younger cousin, would stand and attend to them. In 561, Emperor Wu formally bestowed Yuwen Hu, as the Minister of Palace Affairs (Â§ßÂÜ¢ÂÆ∞), authority over the other five ministries as well. In spring 561, when the general Heruo Dun (Ë≥ÄËã•Êï¶) was unable to hold the modern Hunan region against attacks by the Chen Dynasty general Hou Tian (‰æØÁë±), it was by Yuwen Hu's orders that Heruo was relieved of his posts, despite Heruo's being able to withdraw without further losses. Around the same time, when Emperor Wu posthumously created Yuwen Hu's father Yuwen Hao and uncle Yuwen Luosheng (ÂÆáÊñáÊ¥õÁîü) Dukes of Shao and Ju, respectively, the inheritance of the titles went to Yuwen Hu's sons Yuwen Hui (ÂÆáÊñáÊúÉ) and Yuwen Zhi. In spring 563, when Emperor Wu made a sudden night trip back to Chang'an while visiting Yuan Province (ÂéüÂ∑û, roughly modern Guyuan, Gansu), Houmochen Chong (‰æØËé´Èô≥Â¥á) the Duke of Liang made an off-the-cuff comment to his staff that it must be that Yuwen Hu died. When Houmochen's comments were reported, Emperor Wu rebuked Houmochen, but Yuwen Hu then followed up by sending soldiers to surround Houmochen's house to force him to commit suicide, although he permitted Houmochen to be buried with honors due a duke. Later that year, to show Yuwen Hu even greater deference, Emperor Wu ordered that in official documents, naming taboo be observed as to Yuwen Hu's name, an honor rarely given to non-emperors. During the years, Yuwen Hu had tried to send spies to locate his mother Lady Yan and paternal aunt, who were left in the territory of Eastern Wei and its successor state Northern Qi‚Äînot knowing that they had been made servants at the subsidiary palace in Zhongshan (‰∏≠Â±±, in modern Baoding, Hebei). In 564, during peace negotiations with Northern Qi (following a joint Northern Zhou-Tujue attack on Northern Qi earlier that year), Northern Qi released Yuwen Hu's paternal aunt to Northern Zhou, and further promised to release Lady Yan. Emperor Wucheng of Northern Qi had Lady Yan exchange letters with Yuwen Hu, intending to use her to force concessions, but fearful of another Northern Zhou attack if he angered Yuwen Hu, released her without actually securing concessions. However, Yuwen Hu, concerned that Tujue might be displeased if Northern Zhou abandoned the joint operations, nevertheless launched another joint attack with Tujue later in 564, but the armies that he sent to attack Luoyang were defeated by Northern Qi troops and forced to withdraw. (Historians largely blamed the defeat on Yuwen Hu's half- hearted devotion to the attack and his lack of overall military strategic talent.) In 565, when Heruo, again made a provincial governor, complained to messengers sent to him by the central government, Yuwen Hu became so displeased that he summoned Heruo back to Chang'an and forced him to commit suicide. In summer 567, when the Chen general Hua Jiao (ËèØÁöé), fearful of adverse intentions of the regent Chen Xu, offered to defect with his Xiang Province (ÊπòÂ∑û, modern central Hunan), Yuwen Hu, over the opposition by the official Cui You (Â¥îÁå∑), sent an army commanded by Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Zhi (ÂÆáÊñáÁõ¥) the Duke of Wei to assist Hua and the forces of Northern Zhou's vassal Emperor Ming of Western Liang, who was also aiding Hua. The Chen general Wu Mingche, however, quickly defeated the joint forces of Northern Zhou, Western Liang, and Hua, forcing Hua and Yuwen Zhi to both give up the war and flee to the Western Liang capital Jiangling. Chen was able to retain all of Hua's territory and further make minor territorial gains against both Northern Zhou and Western Liang as well. Yuwen Hu relieved Yuwen Zhi from his posts, and while Yuwen Zhi was eventually restored to them, Yuwen Zhi, who had previously had a cordial relationship with Yuwen Hu, bore a grudge against Yuwen Hu and secretly encouraged Emperor Wu to act against Yuwen Hu. Around the new year 568, Lady Yan died. By Emperor Wu's orders, Yuwen Hu did not observe the customary three-year mourning period, but continued to serve as regent. In winter 570, when the Northern Qi general Hul√º Guang seized the region north of the Fen River (Ê±æÊ∞¥, flowing through modern Linfen, Shanxi), Yuwen Hu turned to another brother of Emperor Wu, Yuwen Xian the Duke of Qi, for advice, and Yuwen Xian suggested that he himself could lead an army against Hul√º, while Yuwen Hu himself should command the main forces but stop at Tong Province (ÂêåÂ∑û, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi). Subsequently, Yuwen Xian was able to force Hul√º into a stalemate, but substantial territories were still lost to Northern Qi. By 572, Emperor Wu was conspiring with Yuwen Zhi, as well as his associates Yuwen Shenju (ÂÆáÊñáÁ•ûËàâ), Wang Gui (ÁéãËªå), and Yuwen Xiaobo (ÂÆáÊñáÂ≠ù‰ºØ), to find a way to kill Yuwen Hu, believing him to be a threat. In spring 572, after Emperor Wu and Yuwen Hu had a meeting, he invited Yuwen Hu into the palace to meet with Empress Dowager Chinu. On the way to her palace, he told Yuwen Hu that Empress Dowager Chinu was having problem with alcoholism and not listening to his advice to stop her drinking, so he wanted Yuwen Hu to advise her to change her ways as well. He further gave Yuwen Hu the text of the Jiu Gao (ÈÖíË™•) -- an anti-alcoholism declaration written by King Cheng of Zhou‚Äîand suggested that he read the Jiu Gao to Empress Dowager Chinu. Once they reached her palace, Yuwen Hu, pursuant to Emperor Wu's request, started reading the Jiu Gao. Before he could finish it, Emperor Wu stepped behind him and used a jade tablet to strike the back of his head. Yuwen Hu fell to the ground, and Yuwen Zhi, who was hiding nearby, jumped out, and cut off Yuwen Hu's head, ending Yuwen Hu's hold on power. Yuwen Hu's sons and key associates were all executed. In 574, Yuwen Hu was posthumously restored to the title of Duke, reburied with honors due a duke, and awarded with a posthumous name (albeit the very unflattering one of Dang (Ëï©, meaning \\"improper\\")).

It is so called due to the fact that it resembles a hammer in both form and function. The hammer itself is a metal piece that forcefully rotates about a pivot point.  Evolution  Artistic rendition of firing a hand cannon from the Late Medieval era. Illuminated manuscript page from Codex Vindobona. Firearms, initially known as \\"hand cannons\\", first became a viable weapon in 1364 through the advancement of chemical technologies to create a gunpowder efficient enough to launch a projectile at high speeds in a hand- held weapon. The issue quickly arose of how to effectively ignite the gunpowder while maintaining the weapon‚Äôs aim at the target. Initially, the problem was solved by using a \\"slow match\\": a chemically treated piece of rope that would stay lit for an extended period of time. The smoldering end of the rope would then be manually brought into contact with the gunpowder through a touch hole in the barrel of the weapon when the user was ready to shoot. It proved difficult for the shooter to both keep the weapon aimed and level as well as ignite the gunpowder with the slow match. The first step to a true hammer system arose shortly after the introduction of the slow match: the matchlock system, introduced in the early 1400s. It acted as an arm, known as a serpentine, that held the lit slow match. When the trigger was pulled, the arm would swing forward from its cocked state (similar to a hammer) via potential energy stored in a spring and bring the lit slow match into contact with the gunpowder. The weapon could be utilized with increased accuracy, since the shooter could maintain both hands on the weapon. Schematic of wheellock system By 1509, the wheellock system arose to solve some difficulties of the matchlock system, though it was a very expensive system. The wheellock system used a piece of pyrite attached to an arm called a dogshead that would be brought into contact with a metal wheel that rotated when the trigger was pulled. This would, in turn, shower sparks upon the gunpowder and cause the weapon to discharge. The wheellock represented a major advancement, for it removed the need for maintaining a continually lit slow match which could go out or give off the shooter‚Äôs location in a time of need. Following the introduction of the matchlock, the flintlock was introduced in the mid-1600s. The flintlock is similar to the wheellock system, but instead of the hammer mechanism holding pyrite and coming into contact with a moving wheel, the arm (called a cock) held a piece of flint and would be brought forcefully into contact with a steel plate when the trigger was pulled. This would also cause pieces of steel to flake off and ignite due to the friction thereby igniting the gunpowder. This method was also far less expensive that the wheellock system. In 1822, the flintlock system was replaced with what can be called the first hammer system. This arose after Scottish clergyman Reverend Alexander Forsyth discovered the property of mercury fulminate (Hg(ONC)2) to combust when struck. Using this discovery, the percussion cap was created. The cap was a small metal cup filled with volatile chemicals placed at the rear of the barrel over a nipple in what was known as the caplock mechanism. A true hammer was cocked via a spring system and held in place until the trigger was pulled to release the hammer. The hammer would then swing forward and strike the percussion cap which would in turn ignite and cause the gunpowder to ignite and fire the weapon. self-contained cartridge The percussion cap was in wide use for almost five decades until the wide-spread introduction of the self-contained cartridge which contained the projectile, gunpowder, and percussion cap all in a single shell that could be easily loaded. The introduction of such a technology led to the implementation of the firing pin and hammer system that is now used in certain weapons. This was done to transfer energy from the still required hammer to the primer within the self-contained cartridge in order to discharge the weapon.  Drawbacks  There are some notable drawbacks to the external hammer system compared to other modern, internal designs. In single-action revolvers, specifically, there is an ever-present danger of accidentally discharging the weapon if the hammer is struck with a shell loaded in the chamber. There is nothing to prevent the hammer from contacting the firing pin and by default the cartridge, in some models, and so the gun will be discharged unintentionally. An external hammer that could easily catch on clothing Other models do have an internal safety mechanism that prevents contact between the hammer and the firing pin unless the trigger is actually pulled. Even so, many single-action revolver owners choose to carry their revolver with the hammer resting on an empty chamber to minimize the risk of accidental discharge. Additionally, for those who carry their firearm as a personal defense weapon, there is the ever-present worry that an external hammer may catch on a loose article of clothing in an emergency situation, because the hammer protrudes at an angle from the rear of the weapon, and as the owner moves to quickly draw their weapon, the hammer may snag on clothing and cause the loss of seconds in a dangerous situation. Paul B. Weston, an authority on police weapons, called the external a ‚Äúfish hook‚Äù that tended to snag clothing during a fast draw.

Boso strove throughout the rest of his life to maintain his title in the face of the Emperor Charles III. He died in 887 and was succeeded by his son Louis under the regency of his wife Ermengard, a daughter of the Emperor Louis II. Louis was adopted by Charles III and legitimised in his royal title.

Fox & Co. was a large department store that originated in Hartford, Connecticut. The store was also the largest privately held department store in the nation when it was sold in 1965 to the May Department Stores Company. In 1992, May Department stores phased-out the G. Fox & Co. name converting them into the Boston-based department store Filene's. In 2005, the May Company merged with Federated Department Stores which converted the store and several other regional chains to Macy's.  History   Early years  George Keller, architect. G. Fox & Co. was established in 1847 by Gerson Fox and his brother, Isaac Fox, and was named I. & G. Fox Co. The first G. Fox store was a single-room storefront opened in Hartford, Connecticut., retrieved 2013-06-04. When Isaac sold his interest to his brother, Gerson renamed the company G. Fox and Company. Gerson's son, Moses, joined the business in 1863, and took over the store in 1880, upon Gerson's death. The early Fox store was famous for home delivery - by wheelbarrow. The store had grown to five floors when it burned to the ground in January 1917. Moses Fox, 66 at the time, announced that work would begin immediately on an 11-story replacement structure.G. Fox & Co., Remembering Great American Department Stores website, accessed October 9, 2009 The new flagship store was located at 960 Main Street in downtown Hartford. History has it that the original store and offices, destroyed by fire, were rebuilt because the store's customers rallied and paid approximately 95% of all outstanding bills - voluntarily. Encouraged by the response, Moses Fox had the new store designed by New York architect Cass Gilbert, as an 11-story behemoth, initially dubbed \\"Fox's folly\\" in reference to its sheer scale. The new store opened in 1918. The fire served as impetus for Beatrice Fox Auerbach, Moses's daughter, and her husband, George Samuel Auerbach, to return to Hartford from Salt Lake City to help with the business. George died in 1927 and Beatrice then began working alongside her father.  Beatrice Fox Auerbach  In 1938, Gerson's granddaughter, Beatrice Fox Auerbach, took control of the company upon her father's (Moses Fox) death, and helped transform it into a dominant retail store in the southern New England area for most of the twentieth century. Not long after taking over in 1938 after Moses' death, Beatrice Auerbach embarked on a major renovation that added elegant art deco interior details and a signature marquee above the display windows and entrances along Main Street. Mrs. Auerbach became one of the most prominent executives in American retailing and gained much respect in the Hartford area for her civic and philanthropic efforts, which included endowment to the University of Hartford that named Auerbach Hall in her honor.The Fox Family , Remembering G. Fox & Co., Connecticut Historical Society, accessed October 9, 2009 Mrs. Auerbach fostered fierce loyalty among her employees and became a pioneer in the realm of employee benefits such as retirement plans, in-store hospitals, loans to employees in need, paid vacations, and at-cost meals. In order to honor longstanding continuous employment, she created the Moses Fox Club to honor those whose employment attained the twenty-five year mark and again at the fortieth and fiftieth year of service. Until her final Moses Fox Club dinner the year before her death, Mrs. Auerbach awarded at least one fifty year pin each year of the club's existence. G. Fox & Co., 960 Main Street, Hartford, Connecticut (1918), Cass Gilbert, architect. This was the store's flagship location from 1919 to 1993. Mrs. Auerbach's belief in customer service was so focused that employees were charged with making sure every customer was satisfied, regardless of the cost. While the sales staff was not permitted to make final decisions in this area, Mrs. Auerbach's service managers had the last word, even to the extent that, on rare occasion, they were permitted to override a merchant's decision and take charge to satisfy a customer's need. While no service manager was ever chastised in this effort, an occasional merchant received the dreaded summons to the eleventh floor to be reminded by Mrs. Auerbach personally of her commitment to customer satisfaction. Further evidence of the store's commitment to service had a small staff of the service management personnel and two or three drivers on duty, sometimes until after midnight, on Christmas Eve to dispatch replacements for gifts that had not been received in time to be placed under the tree for Christmas. Following Mrs. A's (as she was fondly known by the staff) instincts, G. Fox added several major additions to the downtown complex, including a nine-story retail addition to the Market Street (rear) side of the building. To accomplish this addition, a nine-story brick, concrete and steel warehouse had to be moved from one side of a city block to the opposite side - an immense feat at the time. Other additions included a major warehouse (Mrs. Auerbach insisted that it be referred to as the \\"Service Building\\") in the 1930s, and a multi-level parking garage in the 1960s to accommodate family cars exiting from the two newly opened Interstate highways into downtown Hartford, and the sixty-station telephone-order department. The parking garage was situated next to the new interchange of interstate highways 91 and 84. Allegedly, the construction of this interchange, notoriously poor in its original configuration and on a very constrained site, was the result of Mrs. Auerbach's insistence that the off- ramps of the new highway deposit customers, almost literally at the front door of her store. Considering the prevailing culture of the 1960s, and how few female executives existed at the time, this story, if true, would underscore just how influential Mrs. Auerbach was, particularly within the Hartford business community. The story, however, is often regarded as a local urban legend. The non-completion of the interchange was actually caused by local objections to the planned route of connectors through or under Bushnell Park and its sweeping lawn in front of the Connecticut State Capitol designed to bring traffic onto the two highways south of where they actually crossed. To this day motorists entering or exiting Interstate 84 at the Sisson Avenue interchange can see the unfinished exits that would have serviced those never- built connectors. In any event, it would be the mid 1990s before the interchange would be reconstructed to correct many of the earlier flaws, thanks to new technology that allowed construction of a \\"fly-over\\" ramp to take vehicles from Interstate 84 East to Interstate 91 North. When the company's third branch store was being constructed in Meriden, G. Fox (actually the May Co.) paid the state of Connecticut the funds necessary to have a highway exit near the new store completed in time for the opening of the new branch.  Downtown expansion  Throughout the mid 20th century, the store continued to grow exclusively at its downtown Hartford location. Against prevailing trends, Mrs. Auerbach believed that branch stores only detracted from the appeal of the flagship store. This was, in no small part, due to the failure of Foxmart, a farm equipment and supply \\"branch\\" of G. Fox in Connecticut's Tobacco Valley. Instead of creating branch locations and in an effort to reach out to her distant customers, Mrs. Auerbach had about one- third of the 11th floor Toy Department carved out and expanded the store's telephone-order facility. As part of this effort, the company added direct phone lines to every exchange in Connecticut and parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In 1947, two years after World War II ended, G. Fox celebrated its 100th birthday. A final expansion of the downtown store occurred in 1969, when G. Fox took over and expanded into basement and first and second floors of the adjacent historic Cheney Building, designed by H. H. Richardson, that housed another local department store, Brown Thomson, which G. Fox had acquired sometime earlier (G. Fox had already expanded into the third, fourth and fifth floors where general management, personnel, credit & collection, advertising, marketing and sundry behind-the-scenes functions were housed). This building would later be redeveloped into the Richardson Shops Mall in 1980 with about 40 stores, a food court and some residential apartments. The mall also connected G. Fox to the flagship store of another local department store chain, Sage-Allen, which eventually closed this location in the summer of 1990, with the entire chain declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy and eventually folding in 1994. The G. Fox flagship store was known for customer attractions, including a large walk-through Christmas display and a talking myna bird housed in a huge cage located on the fifth floor. The store was a pioneer in exhibiting home furnishings in an actual home setting, including kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms and dens. There were two restaurants located on the second floor; one was a lunch bar, while the Connecticut Room was more elegant and featured sit-down meals with table service. Occasionally, G. Fox hosted a fashion show while patrons dined.  May Department stores  After the 1965 sale of the store to the May Department Stores Company, G. Fox began an ambitious expansion beyond its Hartford base, building its first branch store in 1969 in Waterbury and thus beginning a 12-store branch expansion that continued until the chain was folded into the May Company's Filene's division in 1992. As a result of this merger, coupled with the severe recession that took hold of the regional economy in the early 1990s and the decline of Hartford's downtown retail environment, the flagship store and the executive offices were shuttered on January 29, 1993. Prior to the merger with Filene's, two additional G. Fox stores were announced in Albany, New York and Stamford, Connecticut The Albany store eventually opened at Crossgates Mall, but under the Filene's banner in 1994, and the Stamford store, part of a proposed mall with an existing Lord & Taylor, was never built. Eventually, a Filene's store would open at the nearby Stamford Town Center mall in 1996 in a former J.C. Penney location, but it would close in 2004.  Closing  On February 1, 1993, the remaining G. Fox & Co. stores were re-branded as Filene's, until September 9, 2006 when most of that chain was converted to Macy's, after corporate parent May Company's merger with (assumption by) Federated Department Stores was completed on August 30, 2005 and Federated rebranded its corporate self as Macy's, Inc. After being abandoned for almost a decade, the downtown Hartford G. Fox building was re-opened in the fall of 2002 as a mixed-use commercial complex known as 960 Main. The building now houses street-level retail space, office space, meeting facilities the \\"Gershon Fox Room\\" in honor of one of the founders of the store, and the new campus for Capital Community College. This renovation and adaptive re-use maintained many of the art deco interior and exterior details while adding a large interior atrium and interior circulation space. In addition, a new and much larger parking garage was also built on the site of the original G. Fox garage on Market and Talcott Streets. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the Department Store Historic District.

Early life As a child, Barnes picked and chopped cotton, growing up in Tuckerman, Arkansas. He played basketball wearing socks, as his family was too poor to afford basketball shoes. At age 13, Barnes had grown to 6'6\\" and his grandfather was said to have been 7'0\\" tall. Barnes attended the all black W.F. Branch High School in Newport, Arkansas after they promised to provide him basketball shoes. The team finished 3rd in the 1957 State Black Basketball Championships. Barnes then moved to Poplar Bluff High School (Mo.), where he was ruled ineligible due to residency issues. He returned to Branch where, playing in socks, as his feet had grown to size 17, he scored 68 points and had 38 rebounds against Vanndale. Barnes' family was influenced, moved and he then enrolled at Stillwater High School in Stillwater, Oklahoma. There, he gained further notoriety when Stillwater defeated a state title Pampa, Texas team 94-40. However, Barnes was ruled ineligible after one season, after recruiting allegations surfaced and the team had to forfeit 22 games. He later returned to the team, after a suspension, that had won just a handful of games all season. He proceeded to lead them to 10 consecutive victories and the state championship. He was chosen as the Oklahoma High School Player of the Year, the first black player to receive the award. College career A forward/center, Barnes then began his college career at Cameron College (at the time, a junior college) in Lawton, Oklahoma. Barnes chose Cameron after being recruited by Coach Henry Iba and Oklahoma A & M (now Oklahoma State) in Stillwater, saying later, ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt think academically I had the foundation to make it at a big college.‚Äù He tallied 28.8 points per game in his freshman year (1960-1961)and 30.6 points per game in his sophomore year. He also received NJCAA All-American honors as a sophomore (1961-1962).James \\"Bad News\\" Barnes . cameronaggies.com Barnes then chose to attend the Texas Western College (now known as University of Texas at El Paso), under Hall of Fame Coach Don Haskins. Haskins' recruiting of Barnes led to a free throw contest that was won by Haskins and Barnes enrolled, saying Haskins and Miners player (and future Hall of Fame Coach) Nolan Richardson won him over with their honesty. Barnes enrolled at Texas Western, along with his good friend from Cameron, Ulysses Kendall, who played football for then Texas Western Football Coach Bum Phillips and later the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1962-63 Barnes averaged a double-double of 18.9 points and 16.5 rebounds, shooting 50.3% from the field and 76.2% from the line, for the Texas Western Miners. The team finished 19-7 and qualified for the 1963 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament, the Miners first trip to the NCAA's. In 1963-64 Barnes averaged 29.1 points and 19.2 rebounds on 56.3% shooting from the field. His season was highlighted by a 51-point, 36 rebound effort in a 100-56 win over Western New Mexico on Jan. 4, 1964. The 1963-64 Miners finished 25-3 and advanced to the 1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament, where they were defeated by Kansas State in the Midwest Regional Semi-Final as Barnes fouled out of the game. Barnes had 42 points and 19 rebounds in the Miners' 68-62 first round win over Texas A & M. The Miners beat Texas A&M; (68-62) and lost to Kansas State (64-60) before knocking off Creighton 63-52, behind Barnes' 15 points and 10 rebounds, in the Midwest Region third-place game. \\"It was a special, special team\\" Haskins said years later, \\"and believe me, if Barnes' hadn't fouled out against Kansas state, that team would have won the title.\\" Barnes still holds UTEP single-game records for points, rebounds and field goals made. His career with 48 double-doubles, are also still the most in Miner history. The Miners program went on to win the 1966 NCAA Championship, defeating the University of Kentucky in the NCAA final. Professional career Barnes was selected by the New York Knicks with the first overall pick of the 1964 NBA draft. Barnes was named to the 1965 NBA All-Rookie Team, after averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds as a rookie for the Knicks in 1964-1965. Then, on November 2, 1965, Barnes was averaging 15.7 points and 10.3 rebounds in 41 games, when he was traded by the Knicks with Johnny Egan, Johnny Green to the Baltimore Bullets for fellow former No. 1 pick (1961 NBA draft), Walt Bellamy. Barnes was very productive in his early career, averaging a double-double, before numerous knee and achilles injuries slowed him and eventually ended his career. After averaging 15.5 points and 9.7 rebounds for the Knicks/Bullets in 1964-1965, he averaged 12.4 points and 10.3 rebounds for the Bullets in 1965-1966. After that, he played less minutes due to injuries and became an effective reserve player. Barnes won an NBA Championship with the Celtics in 1969-1969, serving at the backup to Bill Russell, although hampered by injury, he did not appear in the playoffs. Barnes' career then ended in 1971 after 11 games with Baltimore and brief stints with the Allentown Jets and Trenton Pat Pavers of the Eastern Professional Basketball League. Overall, Barnes appeared in 454 games and played seven seasons (1964‚Äì71) in the NBA.

National team career Barnes was then selected a member of the 1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team. The USA team, coached by Henry Iba won the Gold Medal in the Tokyo Games when they defeated USSR, 73-59. Of his Olympic experience, Barnes recalled, \\"Mr. Iba didn't want me practicing with the team because he was afraid I might hurt someone, I was kind of rough and tough. But Mr. Iba did a great job of bringing all that talent together. Nobody was expecting this team to win the Olympics.\\" Barnes was the top field-goal shooter (53 percent) on the Olympic squad, averaging 8.5 points in the teams' nine games. Barnes roomed with Bill Bradley and had Walt Hazzard and Larry Brown among his teammates Personal life Celtics' coach and general manager, Red Auerbach, said of Barnes: \\"Jim's many friends and associates affectionately called him 'Bad News' [for the damage he did to opposing teams and players], but he was always 'Good News' to me. His tenure with the Celtics was short, but I enjoyed every moment he was there. Jim was a tremendous talent who never reached his full potential as an athlete. But Jim Barnes took it one better he was a great human being.\\" College teammate at UTEP Steve Tendennick said of Barnes, \\"He had a fantastic disposition,he was a gentle guy, but competitive. He was a great leader. He had the ability to corral all of us and keep us focused on what we needed to do. He was a wonderful friend and a wonderful teammate,\\" Tredennick said. \\"Sometimes when you're as talented as Jim in relation to whoever is around you, you can be difficult to live with. He wasn't like that. He was a super guy. I'm sure if they kept assists [in 1964], he would've had a decent number. We had a rule, if you threw it into Barnes and he threw it back out to you, then you had the green light to shoot.\\" After his basketball career ended, Barnes settled in the Baltimore, Maryland area, after having played for the Baltimore Bullets twice. Barnes was a board member of the Washington D.C. organization \\"Kids in Trouble Inc.\\" There, Barnes was involved in an annual celebrity tennis event, provided school counseling, was active in events on stopping youth violence and was a volunteer basketball coach for a local church team. Barnes advised star Maryland football player LaMont Jordan to focus on his studies and stay in school as an underclassman. Barnes marketed a barbecue sauce called, ‚ÄúBad News Barbecue Sauce,‚Äù which was sold in the Washington D.C. area and was on shelves for 24 years, selling 3 million cases.\\"I wanted to market something so people who were allergic to tomatoes could enjoy good smoke-grilled foods,\\" said Barnes. Rapper Blu named Jim Barnes his cousin in his song titled \\"Bad News Barnes\\" on his 2008 mixtape (So)ul Amazing. Barnes died as a result of heart problems on September 14, 2002, at age 61. Barnes was survived by his wife, Gerri, and three daughters. Awards and honors * Barnes was chosen to carry the Olympic Torch in Little Rock, Arkansas on Memorial Day, 1996, saying: \\"After 32 years, I was chosen to carry the Olympic torch in my home state, but I couldn't see myself carrying it the whole mile, so three-quarters of the way through I gave it to a 14-year-old girl named Sarah and let her finish. Hopefully she'll go on and do something positive for someone someday.\\" * UTEP retired Barnes' #45 jersey.

Terry in 2017 Genetic Alliance is a nonprofit organization, founded in 1986 by Joan O. Weiss, working with Victor A. McKusick, to advocate for health benefits in the accelerating field of genomic research. This organization is a network of over 1,000 disease advocacy organizations, universities, government organizations, private companies, and public policy organizations. They aim to advance genetic research agendas toward health benefit by engaging a broad range of stakeholders, including healthcare providers, researchers, industry professionals, public policy leaders, as well as individuals, families and communities. They create programs using a collaborative approach, and aim to increase efficiency and reduce obstacles in genetic research, while ensuring that voices from the involved disease communities are heard. They also promote public policies to advance healthcare. Genetic Alliance provides technical support and informational resources to guide disease-specific advocacy organizations in being their own research advocates. They also maintain a biobank as a central storage facility for several organizations who otherwise would not have the infrastructure to maintain their own repository. History The organization was founded in 1986 by Joan O. Weiss, working with Victor A. McKusick, to advocate for health benefits in the accelerating field of genomic research. The organisation is an umbrella organisation for a number of charities dealing with genetic diseases. The founding chair of the Genetic Alliance in 1989 was Ann Mercy Hunt who had founded the Tuberous Sclerosis Association. Genetic Alliance Registry and Biobank Genetic Alliance manages a biobank, the Genetic Alliance Registry and Biobank (GARB), which is a cooperatively-managed clinical data and tissue sample repository. GARB was established in 2003,Terry, S.F., Terry, P.F. (2006). \\"A Consumer Perspective on Forensic DNA Banking,\\" Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics, 404-14. and combines its standardized infrastructure with the interests and motivations of disease advocacy groups to develop effective diagnostic tools and treatments, to ‚Äúaccelerate the research enterprise beyond its usual pace and involving new players, the advocates.‚ÄùTerry, S.F., Terry, P.F., Rauen, K.A., Uitto, J., Bercovitch, L.G. (2007). \\"Advocacy Groups as Research Organizations: The PXE International Example,\\" Nature Reviews Genetics. 8(2):157-64. Individual disease advocacy organizations maintain control over their data and samples throughout the research process, while enabling collaboration among scientists by leveraging their resources: well-characterized, robust data sets including pooled samples from people with the disease. Participating organizations store their data and samples in GARB for on-going use in research, with the goal of developing new diagnostic tools and treatments for diseases. Genetic Alliance provides the facility, collection, processing and archiving of samples stored in the biobank, as well as training and tools for organizations to effectively participate in this resource. GARB is governed collaboratively by an advisory board, with representatives from the seven currently participating organizations, which determines policies regarding stewardship, protection and usage of the data. GARB has an institutional review board (IRB), which approves data collection protocols, material transfer agreements, and documents used in informed consent and minor assents. Organizations participating in GARB pay an annual fee to have access to GARB's IRB-approved protocols, training and technical assistance, and infrastructure for tissue banking. Stored data include ‚ÄúDNA, RNA, cell lines, tissue, organs, self- reported data, medical images, medical records,‚Äù amounting to over 30,000 samples and clinical records. Researchers can apply for access to samples and data in GARB via the advocacy organization responsible for them. GARB was based on a biobank established by PXE International in 1995. PXE International is a disease advocacy organization, founded by Sharon Terry and Patrick Terry. In managing their biobank, they developed a series of protocols and systems for data collection, storage and use. Their efforts contributed to significant scientific advances, including the discovery of the gene responsible for Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Drawing from their experiences, they began mentoring other disease advocacy organizations in developing new biobanks. The founders of the PXE International biobank established GARB to provide a new model for facilitating research, ‚Äúon the principal that a shared infrastructure would facilitate easy flow of resources and accelerate disease- specific research.‚ÄùTerry, S.F., Horn, E.J., Scott, J., Terry, P.F. (2011). \\"Genetic Alliance Registry and Biobank: A Novel Disease Advocacy-Driven Research Solution,\\" Personalized Medicine. 8(2):207-13. A central value upon which GARB was established is a respect for specimen donors as participants in a dynamic community-engaged process. Samples and data may be reused in many research studies, and re-contacting participants is possible to ensure on- going interaction and communication with those who donate to GARB.

McGill was the No. 1 overall pick of the 1962 NBA draft from the University of Utah, after leading the NCAA in scoring with 38.8 points per game in 1961-1962. Early life McGill was born in San Angelo, Texas, where his mother left him in the care of relatives. When he was five, he moved with his mother to Los Angeles, California. McGill attended Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, graduating in 1958. There he was a four-time All Los Angeles City basketball selection (a second team pick in 1955 and a first team choice from 1956‚Äì58) playing for Coach Larry Hanson. He was the Los Angeles City Player of the Year in 1957 and 1958, leading Jefferson to two City Championships, in 1955 and 1958.https://1.cdn.edl.io/9HMom2KsX9YJwyUr7hnnDg0Q53tJC9d74zUlRTxI2QiU9Jrt.pdfhttps://1.cdn.edl.io/ZFuxG2YygknWj0IYGgXLOggCZrNG89JQeTmDl31gsfsmMGei.pdf It was during his junior year at Jefferson that he severely injured his knee in a game against Fremont High School. McGill never followed the recommended medical advice for the injury, as doctors told him not to play basketball any longer and wanted to replace the knee. For years, a doctor secretly drained his knee regularly. Over 250 colleges recruited McGill. He was strongly recruited to Cal by Coach Pete Newell, but his academics weren't strong enough for him to be admitted. McGill recalled his visit to the University of Utah and Hall of Fame Coach Jack Gardner. He said Salt Lake City was \\"overwhelming and beautiful,\\" adding, \\"Nothing I have seen on the streets of LA have prepared me for this. It's breathtaking.\\" ‚Äú(McGill) was a player I had to have,‚Äù said Gardner years later.

Professional career On March 26, 1962, McGill was selected by the Chicago Zephyrs with the first pick of the 1962 NBA draft. In 1962-1963, as a rookie for Chicago, McGill played in 60 games, averaging 7.4 points and 2.6 rebounds, as the Zephyrs were 25-55 under Jack McMahon and Slick Leonard.

On October 18, 1964, McGill was traded by the Knicks to the St. Louis Hawks for a 1965 2nd round draft pick (Hal Blevins was later selected). While with the Hawks, McGill taught his jump hook to Bob Pettit, who eventually made the shot a staple of his. After playing sparingly in 16 games for the Hawks, on January 28, 1965, McGill was signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played sparingly in just 8 games. From 1964-1968, McGill played intermittently in the North American Basketball League for the Grand Rapids Tackers (1964-1967) and Holland Carvers (1967-1968). In 1965-1966 (Grand Rapids) and 1967-1968 (Holland), he was named to the First Team NABL All-Star Team.

Overall, McGill played three seasons (1962‚Äì65) in the NBA and 2 seasons (1968‚Äì70) in the ABA. In his ABA/NBA career, he scored a combined 3,094 points, averaging 10.5 points and 4.4 rebounds on 51.4% shooting. The jump hook McGill is credited with creating the jump hook. Bill Sharman said McGill had \\"the most fantastic turnaround jump hook there was. Nobody could stop it.\\" Sharman also noted that McGill didn't have the strength or quickness to play effective defense in part because of his bad knee. The jump hook legend was that it was first used by McGill in the summer of 1955 when then college stars and future Hall-of-fame players Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Guy Rodgers met up with McGill on a LA playground in a pick-up game. McGill was a freshman at Jefferson High School. Russell chose to play with McGill, who then used an impromptu shot against the taller, stronger Chamberlain. The shot was a jump hook. Personal His pro basketball career did not bring him wealth or security. By the early 1970s, he was in debt and living on the streets before sportswriter Brad Pye Jr. arranged for McGill to be employed by Hughes Aircraft; that job ended in 1995.Crowe, Jerry; Los Angeles Times After basketball, McGill's hills became mountains, February 21, 2011; page C2. The NBA occasionally asked McGill to provide advice to players on the importance of finishing their education through the NBA's Rookie Transition Program.

It is located on the central south coast of the island. Notable Fa ªamatai titles of Vaiee include the Warrior title of Te'o or sometimes referred to as the 'Anava-o-taua' which literally translates to 'instituter of war', Tuia and Maugatai or also referred to as the 'Matua' which translates to the 'eldest' or the 'first settler'. Other notable matai titles include the orator titles of Lutuimagamau, Lealaimuna, Availepule and Faiavalesua as well as usoalii and other orator titles such as Tula'i, Fuialii, Matauiau, Sagala, Ipiipi etc. The village is situated in the Safata subdistrict of the larger Tuamasaga district. To the West it is bordered by Niusuatia, and to the East by Fusi Safata. The village of Vaiee is known for many activities and sports such as Samoan Cricket and Rugby. The village has a population of around 400 individuals and is made up of around 10 extended family units, headed by individual chiefs. The village is predominantly Christian and has only one established and recognized denomination, being the Ekalesia Faapotopotoga Kerisiano o Samoa (CCCS). The church was founded in 1843 by the LMS Missionary Rev. George Turner and the people of Vaiee Safata, the same Rev. Turner who went on to establish and run the Malua Theological College. The village has a tapu or taboo on other denominations besides the EFKS/CCCS being formally established within the village. However, a handful of the village belong to other denominations outside the village such as Catholicism, Mormonism, Evangelical Christian Churches and others. The village was once situated on a narrow peninsular separated from the mainland by a narrow stretch of water, part of the peninsular belonged to the village while other parts were under the administration of neighbouring villages such as Tafitoala and Fusi Safata. The village or the aai was moved twice to the mainland, it first moved to the mainland in the late 19th century but moved back to the peninsular following strict German laws on settlement structures and cleanliness. In 1955 the village council then again decided to move the village back to the mainland where it is now to allow for better access to transport infrastructure and water supplies. The Geography of the area is mostly volcanic in composition and is characterized by rolling hills which further define smaller divisions within the village, such as: Fualalo (below the hill), Ogatotonu (middle) and Fualuga (Above the hill). A large peninsular stretches from the village of Tafitoala to the East forming an indentation of water which is only linked to the sea through a narrow opening situated in Vaiee's coastal reaches. This forms a large natural bay and natural protection from ocean surges during cyclones and extensive effects of tsunamis. The Bay allows for a complex Mangrove and Coastal Marine ecosystem to flourish which in recent times has seen a decline due to over-fishing, village neglect and unsustainable fishing practices. However through conservation legislation passed by the Government of Samoa, large tracks of mangroves and marine life are now protected. The village also owns large tracts of lands inland, where some of the villagers have cultivated but most of which have been left abandoned due to difficulties in the terrain. Vaiee has a large diaspora centered around New Zealand and Australia as most villages in Samoa have, they have contributed greatly to the development of the village both economically and socially. There are 5 shops in the village owned by, Tuia Siaosi, Sitaua Maugatai, Paole Teo, Teo Saluvale and Malaesilia Lene, there is also a Taxi Stand and takeaway restaurant also owned by Malaesilia Lene and Susana.

Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 128, Allen Lane 2012 History and origins The ancient Libournais tradition of flooding the vineyards in winter may have helped century-plus old vines of Bouchal√®s survive the phylloxera epidemic, due to the flood waters disrupting the nymph stage (pictured right) in the life cycle of the phylloxera louse. French ampelographer Guy Lavignac has theorized that the name Bouchal√®s comes from the Occitan word meaning \\"box tree\\" and could refer to the way that the Bouchal√®s vine in full foliage resembles a box shape. However, Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that many Vitis vinifera grapevines resemble boxes, and since Bouchal√®s is a common surname in the Lot-et-Garonne region, it is likely that the grape took on the name of one of its propagators. In the Dordogne region, Bouchal√®s is also known as Bouissalet; this has led some ampelographers to believe that the grape could be a dark color mutation of the white wine grape Arrufiac which is known as Bouissalet in the Pacherenc du Vic-Bilh region, but DNA testing has ruled out a connection between the two varieties. Documents from 1783-1784 described Bouchal√®s being widely planted throughout southwest France (the Sud- ouest), particularly in the Lot-et-Garonne, Gers, and Dordogne departments. Vineyards in Agen, Auch, Estillac, Saint-Barth√©lemy-de-Bellegarde, and Tonneins were particularly noted for Bouchal√®s growing well there and producing deeply colored \\"black wine\\" of good quality. Like many Vitis vinifera varieties, plantings of Bouchal√®s were decimated during the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century. The fact that Bouchal√®s experienced difficulties in taking the grafting of American rootstock (like Vitis riparia and Vitis rupestris) also contributed to its decline. However, in 2009 a Libournais vineyard belonging to Ch√¢teau de la Vieille Chapelle was discovered to contain ungrafted Bouchal√®s vines over 100 years old. Wine expert Jancis Robinson and others have speculated that these vines survived the phylloxera epidemic due to the frequent winter flood irrigation of the vineyards that was a tradition of Libournais viticulture for many centuries. This flooding with waters from the nearby Dordogne River would disrupt the life cycle of the phylloxera louse by inhibiting its growth during its nymph stage. Viticulture Bouchal√®s is a productive vine that can create full foliage and high yields if not severely pruned. It has a tendency to bud early and ripen mid-season. The main viticultural hazards for Bouchal√®s, beyond its difficulty to take to grafted rootstocks, is its susceptibility to black rot. Wine regions Southwest France where the Bouchal√®s grape is found. Most of the plantings today are along the Garonne river. Scattered plantings of Bouchal√®s can be found throughout southwest France with the majority found following the path of the Garonne river. In 1958 there were 12,355 acres (5,000 hectare) but by 2008 that figure had dipped to only 272 acres (110 hectares). Confusion with other grape varieties Over the years Bouchal√®s has often been confused with other grapevines due to either similarity in appearance or synonyms. This includes the M√©rille grape of the Garonne that is also grown in the Ari√®ge department where historic plantings of Bouchal√®s once were. Also in the Garone it has been confused for C√¥t, the local name for the ancient Bordeaux variety Malbec. Synonyms Over the years Bouchal√®s has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Aubet, Bouchal√®s Chedy, Bouchalets (in Lot-et-Garonne), Bouchar√®s, Bouchedey, Boucher√®s (in Dordogne), Bouissalet (in Dordogne), Bouscal√®s, Bouscar√®s, Bouyssalet, Capbreton Rouge, Cayla, Crapput, Craput, Cujas, Esparbasque, Grappu, Grapput (in Gironde), Gros de Judith, Gros grappu, Gros Marthy, Gros Marty, Gros maure, Gros Mol, Jeanjean, N√©grasse, Picardan, Picardan noir, Piquardan, Plant Touzau, Prolongeau, Prueras, Prueyras, Queuefort, Sensit Rouge, Toussan and Touzan.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Bouchal√®s Accessed: March 19th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Bouchal√®s"},{"id":"8110840","text":"Afega is a village on the island of Upolu in Samoa.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry.Williamson and Bujeiro 2004, pp. 3‚Äì4. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the acceptance by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht‚Äîthe Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)‚Äîas well as the Waffen-SS, the Reich Labour Service, and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award.Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 113‚Äì460, 483, 485‚Äì487, 492, 494, 498‚Äì499, 501, 503, 509. These recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, [The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939‚Äì1945]. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.Scherzer 2007, pp. 117‚Äì186. Listed here are the 82 Knight's Cross recipients of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS whose last name starts with \\"C\\".Fellgiebel 2000, pp. 152‚Äì156, 488. The recipients are initially ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded. Background The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross. Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds, based on the enactment of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized. Recipients The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists for the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS. Within each of these lists a unique sequential number was assigned to each recipient. The same numbering paradigm was applied to the higher grades of the Knight's Cross, one list per grade.Fellgiebel 2000, p. 112. Of the 82 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \\"C\\", ten were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and five presentations were made posthumously. Heer members received 51 of the medals, five went to the Kriegsmarine, 22 to the Luftwaffe, and four to the Waffen-SS. {|class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" |-  Name  Service  Rank  class=\\"unsortable\\" Role and unitFor an explanation of the various naming schemes used by the Luftwaffe, Heer, Kriegsmarine and Waffen-SS refer to nomenclature used by the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS.

The brand was introduced in 2002 by Elgato Systems and was sold to Geniatech in 2016.  History  The first EyeTV model, introduced in 2002. The first EyeTV hardware device was introduced in November 2002. It was a small USB-powered device that contained a cable tuner and hardware encoder in order to convert television video into an MPEG-1 format for watching on a computer. It also had coaxial and RCA plugs to connect it with a VCR or camcorder. A 2002 article in Macworld said it was the \\"first step\\" in bridging computers and television, but at this point still had \\"some kinks\\". The next iteration was released in 2004 and called EyeTV 200. EyeTV 200 introduced a digital remote control and converted video programming into the higher-quality MPEG-2 format. A Macworld review gave it 4 out of 5 stars for \\"very good\\" and emphasized the video quality and ease-of- use. A story in the Washington Post said it was more expensive than some alternatives, but worked on a Mac and had good-quality recordings. Also in 2004 the first EyeTV product for satellite television was introduced with the EyeTV 310,https://www.elgato.com/de/news/eyetv-310-fuer-paytv-mac which was later discontinued and replaced with EyeTV Sat. That same year a home media server called EyeHome was introduced. It had recording features similar to other EyeTV products, but was also intended for streaming a computer display to a television. It connected Mac computers and televisions that share the same home network. A review in Macworld gave it three stars or a \\"good\\" rating, saying that it was easy to install and worked well with Apple applications, but some aspects were quirky or frustrating. Sound and Vision Magazine said it was \\"pretty darn cool\\" and an easy, inexpensive way to get media server functionality, though there were some user interface quirks. It gave the product an 89 out of 100 rating. By 2005, several other EyeTV products had been introduced, such as the EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. The EyeTV for DTT (digital terrestrial TV) is a small USB- powered device with an antenna for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar. A review in The Register gave it an 85 percent rating. The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with an analog tuner for watching TV on a Mac computer. In 2006, version 2.1 of the EyeTV software was introduced with a new user-interface, an integrated TV guide from TitanTV and compatibility with Apple remotes. The interface was similar to that of other Apple products. An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to- find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary. Version 2.4 of the EyeTV software was released in 2007 and added an export tool for Apple TV.  Exit from the ATSC tuner market  As of February 2015, EyeTV no longer sells ATSC tuners. (ATSC is the digital television standard used in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.) The Elgato web site explicitly declined to give a reason: \\"Elgato Technical Support is not able to comment on this business decision.\\"As of February 2015, Elgato no longer offers TV tuner devices in North America https://help.elgato.com/customer/portal/articles/1858903-as-of- february-2015-elgato-no-longer-offers-tv-tuner-devices-in-north-america In February 2016, Elgato sold EyeTV to Geniatech Europe GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Geniatech Inc., Ltd. Geniatech will take over the complete EyeTV product line. This company no longer sells the Turbo.264 HD software and reduced digital TV tuners to one model. No news about Thunderbolt products continuity.  Products  The EyeTV Micro product for Android devices The EyeTV Hybrid  Over the air  The EyeTV Diversity is a USB- powered device with dual tuners for receiving over the air television broadcasts. The tuners can be used simultaneously for an optimized signal, or one tuner can be used to record a channel, while another is used to watch a separate show. Diversity was first introduced in November 2006. A driver in 2009 added compatibility with Windows 7. A review in TechRadar gave EyeTV Diversity five out of five stars. PC Advisor and Pocket-Lint both gave it four out of five stars. EyeTV Hybrid, which can pick up digital or analog television broadcasts, was first released in early 2009. A CNET review said the device was easy and effective to use, but that buffering was often too slow to make watching live TV practical. Macworld said EyeTV's \\"core strength\\" was recording scheduled TV shows. A review in PC Magazine gave the product 3.5 out of 5 stars. The review said it \\"works exceptionally well\\" but doesn't come with Windows software.  Satellite  In June 2010, the EyeTV HD product for recording high-definition cable and satellite programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product four out of five stars. A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs. The EyeTV Netstream 4Sat has four satellite tuners, allowing four channels to be watched simultaneously from different devices. It was introduced in 2014. A review in Macworld gave it 5 out of 5 stars. The review said Elgato had addressed some of the limitations of prior EyeTV satellite tuners like Netstream Sat/DTT. Pocket-Lint gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars CNET gave it five stars. The EyeTV Sat product, which receives free-to-air television, was introduced in Europe in late 2009. The Register gave it an 80% rating, saying that it \\"works well\\" and that the documentation did not make it clear how to install the Apple and Windows versions of the software.  Software  The EyeTV software was updated to version 3.0 in 2008. 3.0 made user interface improvements, such as being able to mark favorites or automatically record shows in a series. A review in TechRadar gave it 4.5 out of 5 stars. The review noted that EyeTV was the de facto software for TV and computer video integration and praised its new features, but said it was expensive when purchased separately. A 2007 article in MacLife said their \\"top picks\\" for USB-powered tuners were those using the EyeTV software, such as the EyeTV hybrid or EyeTV 250. In addition to Elgato's EyeTV line of consumer devices, other brands such as Terratec and Miglia use the EyeTV software in their products through licensing agreements with Elgato.  Mobile  The EyeTV W was introduced in November 2013. It is a small 44 gram device that receives free digital over-the-air television broadcasts and makes it available to portable devices through a wireless hot spot. A review in Macworld said it was portable, easy to use and had good battery life, but noted that users can't connect to other WiFi networks and watch TV at the same time. It gave the product 4 out of 5 stars. An EyeTV Mobile device for iPads was announced at the 2011 International Franchise Conference as the first tuner for the new Freeview system in the United Kingdom. Subsequently the EyeTV Mobile and EyeTV Micro products were released for iPhones and Android respectively. The Micro and Mobile allow users to watch or record free over-the-air television programming from their smartphone. Reviews of the mobile products ranged from 2 out of 5 stars by CNET 4 out of 5 stars in Macworld and 3 out of 5 stars in PC Magazine. There is also an EyeTV iPhone app that allows the user to watch their recorded shows on their iPhone, control their EyeTV recordings or watch live TV while connected to Wi-Fi. A compact version for laptops, the EyeTV GO, was introduced in May 2014.

Ricketts was the No. 1 overall pick of the 1955 NBA draft by the St. Louis Hawks out of Duquesne University. Ricketts played professional basketball and baseball simultaneously and retired from basketball to play baseball. He pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959 and had a 10-season pitching career. He is one of 13 athletes to play in both the NBA and MLB. Early life Dick Ricketts graduated Pottstown High School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania and was the son on Richard and Margaret Ricketts. He had a sister, Alice and a brother Dave. A multi-sport athlete, Dick played alongside his younger brother Dave. The brothers Dick and Dave Ricketts and future Philadelphia Phillies player Howie Bedell played on the Pottstown baseball team that won 48 games in a row. A plaque honoring that team is displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, according to Mercury archives. College basketball career A 6'7\\" forward, Ricketts attended Duquesne University. There, Ricketts became an All-American and played alongside Sihugo Green. Green was the No. 1 overall pick of the 1956 NBA draft. The tandem led Duquesne as the Dukes went 26-3 in 1954-1955 under Coach Dudey Moore, losing in the Final of the 1954 National Invitation Tournament. In 1954-1955, Ricketts averaged 20.1 points and 17.3 rebounds in his senior season as the Duquesne finished 22-4, and won the 1955 National Invitation Tournament. On March 20, 1955, Duquesne beat the Dayton Flyers 70-58 before a sellout crowd of 18,496 at Madison Square Garden in the Final, as Green had 33 points and Ricketts had 23. Ricketts' brother Dave Ricketts was also on the team. For his career at Duquesne, Ricketts averaged 17.7 points and 12.2 rebounds in 111 games over his four seasons. Ricketts was then selected by the St. Louis Hawks with the first pick of the 1955 NBA draft. He would play three seasons in the NBA with the Hawks and the Rochester and Cincinnati Royals, scoring 1,974 career points. NBA career (1955-1958) Drafted #1 overall by the NBA St. Louis Hawks, he was also under contract with the major-league baseball St. Louis Cardinals. In 1955-1956, he began the season with the Hawks, averaging 8.4 points and 6.8 rebounds through 29 games of his rookie season. But, because he was going to be pitching that season for the baseball Rochester Red Wings, Ricketts arranged for the Hawks to sell his basketball contract to the Rochester Royals. He averaged 9.4 points and 7.5 rebounds for Rochester after changing teams. In the 1956-1957 season, Ricketts had his best basketball season for Rochester, averaging 11.2 points and 6.1 rebounds in 72 games. He was also reunited with his college teammate Sihugo Green, who had been the number one pick of the 1956 NBA draft. In 1957-1958, Rochester had moved to Cincinnati and the Royals' Ricketts averaged 7.8 points and 5.7 rebounds playing alongside Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Clyde Lovellette, Maurice Stokes and Jack Twyman. Ricketts was deeply affected by the tragic injury of teammate Maurice Stokes in March, 1958. He immediately retired from pro basketball following that season to become a full-time baseball pitcher. Stokes hit his head on the floor in the last game of the regular season, and the injury manifested itself in the upcoming days, leaving Stokes permanently paralyzed. Stokes finished playing in the game in which he was injured and knocked unconscious. He then played in a playoff game three days later. He became ill after the game and Ricketts and Twyman were assisting him to help him get on the team plane. \\"I feel like I'm going to die,\\" he was saying to Ricketts. He then had a seizure on the flight. Twyman became his legal guardian and helped Stokes for the remainder of his life. Stokes died in 1970. Baseball career (1955-1964) A tremendous athlete, Ricketts had been signed as an amateur free agent pitcher by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1955 and pitched 10 seasons professionally, from 1955-1964. Ricketts pitched for the Allentown Cardinals (A) (1955-1956), the Rochester Red Wings (AAA) (1957-1960). In 1959, Ricketts pitched in 12 games for the St. louis Cardinals, including 9 starts. He had a 1‚Äì6 record, with a 5.82 ERA in 55 innings, playing alongside Stan Musial and fellow pitcher Bob Gibson. On June 14, 1959, Ricketts debuted against the Cincinnati Reds. He was the starting pitcher and pitched 7 innings, allowing 3 runs, in a 3-2 loss. In his next start against the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 19, he pitched 7 innings, allowing 2 runs. He won his only game on June 28, pitching 6 2/3 innings against the Reds for the victory. In his last start against the San Francisco Giants on July 22, Ricketts pitched 6 innings, allowing 3 runs. He gave up 7 runs in two subsequent relief appearances. On September 20, 1960, the St. Louis Cardinals sent Ricketts, Jim Frey, Billy Harrell and Wally Shannon to the Philadelphia Phillies to complete a deal made on September 19, 1960 when the Cardinals sent players to be named later and Bob Sadowski to the Phillies for Don Landrum. Ricketts then pitched for the Phillies' Buffalo Bisons (AAA) team from 1961-64. His overall minor league record was 99-91 with a 3.70 ERA in 301 games and 1597 Innings pitched. NBA and MLB Ricketts is one of 13 athletes to play in both the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball. The 13 are: Danny Ainge, Frank Baumholtz, Gene Conley, Chuck Connors, Michael Jordan, Dave DeBusschere, Dick Groat, Steve Hamilton, Mark Hendrickson, Cotton Nash, Ron Reed, Dick Ricketts and Howie Schultz. Personal * Dick Ricketts' brother Dave Ricketts, was also a 2-sport athlete. A catcher in baseball, Dave played alongside his brother at Duquesne.

Though they are sometimes classified as a bluegrass, alternative country, or cowpunk band, their music draws on a wide array of influences. History Split Lip Rayfield is a band from Wichita, Kansas featuring Kirk Rundstrom (guitar), Eric Mardis (banjo), Wayne Gottstine (mandolin), and Jeff Eaton (bass). Early on, the group's gimmick was Eaton's homemade one-string bass, named Stitchgiver, built from the gas tank of a 1978 Mercury Grand Marquis and a piece of hickory and strung with one piece of Weedwhacker line. The name \\"Split Lip Rayfield\\" was inspired by a real-life person who went to high school with Eaton's parents in Desloge, Missouri. He acquired the nickname \\"Split Lip\\" due to constant chapped lips so bad his lip would split. The trio of Rundstrom, Eaton and Mardis recorded the album Split Lip Rayfield in 1998; Bloodshot released it that same year. In 1999, Split Lip Rayfield released In the Mud, the first album on which the group was joined by Gottstine and performed as a quartet. This album contained fan favorites such as Gottstine's \\"3.2 Flu\\", Rundstrom's \\"Devil\\", Mardis' \\"Hounds\\" and a cover of the George Jones/Melba Montgomery song \\"Easy Street\\". The band followed up the album's release with a nationwide tour. The band's next album, Never Make It Home (2001), also achieved success, as did the subsequent tour. Following the Never Make It Home tour, Split Lip Rayfield took a short hiatus so that its members could refocus on family life and side projects. Upon reassembling, the group traveled to New Orleans to make a record with friend and fellow performer Mike West. The resulting disc, Should Have Seen It Coming (2004), won critical praise. In 2005, Gottstine left the touring group for personal reasons, but the remaining trio continued to tour. Gottstine returned in summer of 2006 after Kirk Rundstrom's cancer diagnosis. In 2008, the group guest wrote various music pieces for an episode of the Adultswim show Squidbillies entitled Mephistopheles Traveled Below to a Southern State Whose Motto is 'Wisdom, Justice and Moderation'. In 2008, the group released \\"I'll Be Around.\\" The album was dedicated to the late Kirk Rundstrom and the title track is a tribute to him. On January 7, 2017, the group released its sixth studio recording, \\"On My Way\\", their first in over eight years. Illness Early in 2006, while on tour in Colorado, Rundstrom sought medical attention for pain in his throat and difficulty in swallowing. Doctors quickly concluded that he had esophageal cancer and would need immediate, intense treatment. Heavy doses of radiation and chemotherapy were unable to completely reverse the damage, and Rundstrom's health suffered greatly from the treatments. However, by early autumn, he was playing shows again. Rundstrom was administered doses of intravenous vitamin C. He lived a year-and-a-half longer than doctors expected. A fully reunited Split Lip Rayfield embarked on another tour and played what was billed as its final show on December 8, 2006, Live at the Cotillion Ballroom, in Wichita. Rundstrom died on February 22, 2007 in Wichita. He is survived by his father, wife, and two daughters. The group decided to continue playing without a replacement dedicating each show to Rundstrom. Gottstine rejoined the band permanently, and their first show without Rundstrom was in August 2007. In 2011, the feature documentary Never Make It Home was released. It was originally intended as a concert film, but eight months into filming, Rundstrom's diagnosis changed director G.J. Echternkamp's plans. The result is an intimate portrait of the musician's final days. Influence Split Lip Rayfield helped pioneer what came to be known as the \\"Stage Five\\" sound, named for the notorious \\"unofficial\\" Stage 5 at the annual Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas. Typically, bluegrass musicians played traditional folk and country songs on acoustic string instruments. Bands like Split Lip faithfully used traditional acoustic instruments but played songs that were more closely related stylistically to rock, punk, or heavy metal. Although Split Lip was not the first of its kind ‚Äî other groups such as the Bad Livers came before ‚Äî a growing number of acoustic \\"thrash-grass\\" bands owe a great debt to Split Lip for helping to define the genre.

It is here that the chiefs of all the families of the village meet regularly to deliberate on the political, social, and economic affairs of the village. It is guided by the faalupega (customary greetings/genealogy) of Solosolo, which acts as a constitution for governance. Faalupega o Solosolo Afio le paia o le Taofia o Malietoa Taulapapa ma le latou tama, Tupo-le-Sava, Afio maia le paia o le Usoalii ma e na 'au i Ao, Maliu maia le mamalu o Saleutogipo'e, o le limamatua o Faleupolu tofiga Village The main malae (village commons) of Solosolo is on the peninsula. This is where the major ceremonies and sporting events take place, and like any Samoan village is the centre of the settlement. The malae is bordered to the west by a Congregational Christian Church and to the east by a Catholic church. These were the two churches built in the village. In recent times, the village has acquired other Christian denominations including Methodist, Nazarene, Assembly of God, and Latter Day Saints. The local primary school sits on the upland part of Solosolo and can be accessed by an inland sealed road. Environment Given its susceptibility to past cyclones and the mountainous terrain of the area, Solosolo's infrastructure is particularly sensitive to natural disaster. The government constructed a seawall in 2006 to ring the Vainamo bay to protect the main east coast road and the bridge over the Namo river to the west of the bay, from wave damage during cyclones. Surfing The bay is still renowned for surfing and is popular with visitors and local surfers, although the reef breaks are not for the inexperienced. There's a right break by a small rocky outcrop nicknamed 'Plum Pudding Rock.'

At the center rear is New Zealander Major General George S. Richardson, Administrator of Samoa between 1923‚Äì1928. 300px FalefƒÅ is located on the north eastern coast of Upolu island in Samoa. It was the ancient capital during the reign of Tupu Tafa'ifa (King) Fonoti who, after having defeated his siblings Va'afusuaga and Samalaulu for control of Samoa, chose to rule from his new seat in Falefa, an honour remembered in its faalupega (Charter and Salutations) to this day. Falefa is headed by the descendants of the two founders of the village - Moe‚Äôono (tulafale-alii or 'matua') and Leutele (tamƒÅalii). It is situated in the Anoama'a i Sasa'e electoral constituency which itself is situated within the larger ancient political 'district' of Atua. Atua is headed by the Tui Atua (sovereign of Atua), a title once held by the seer Tui ƒÄtua Leutele (called Tui Atua Leutelelei'ite) in the 10th century, during Samoa's period of antiquity. Since the 17th century, this mantle has been occupied mainly by one of the two Tama-a-'ƒÅiga (maximal lineage chiefs) of ƒÄtua's Salamasina line: Tupua Tamasese and MatƒÅ'afa. Together with the village of Salani, Falefa is the home of one of Samoa's main political families, 'Aiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao (descendants of Fenunuivao, wife of King Muagututi'a and mother of the first Tupua, Fuiavailili). It is led by Moe'ono and Leutele of Falefa and Tofua'iofo'ia and Fuimaono of Salani, and is the custodian of the Tama-a-'ƒÄiga Tupua Tamasese title.

History & Culture  Falefa Falls, popular swimming and recreational spot for tourists and locals.  Establishment of Falefa  Falefa is one of the oldest and largest villages in Samoa, with its traditional borders stretching from Uafato to the East, Saoluafata to the west and Lotofaga on its southern border. Oral tradition and archaeological evidence from the nearby Sasoa'a Lapita discovery site in the Falefa valley place the date of settlement in the area to as far back as between 300B.C - 200 A.D. According to oral tradition, Falefa was founded by the two sons of Tui Atua Mua‚Äôiteleloa and Leateafaiga (daughter of Lufasiaitu of Uafato, Fagaloa) - Moe'ono Faleologa & his younger brother Leutele Leutogitui. Since then, Falefa has been headed by the descendants of these two brothers who hold the respective Moe'ono (tulafale-alii or 'matua') and Leutele (alii) titles. Leaving their birthplace at Fagaloa, they established their first settlement at the top of mountains overlooking Fagaloa Bay and the Falefa valley, called Manuao. It was from this vantage point atop Manuao that a Falefa war party descended in a surprise attack on the Tongan forces anchored at Fagaloa Bay, foiling Leifi and Tautolo's plot to have Queen Salamasina taken back to her kin in Tonga. The settlement was later moved down to the coast to its present site at the northern edge of the Falefa valley. The size of Falefa was such that a centralised location was needed to rule from and so Moe'ono and Leutele created 'O le Faleupolu o Sagapolu' - the administrative centre from which the seat of Moe'ono and Leutele‚Äôs successors (‚ÄòLaloaoa‚Äô and ‚ÄòVai‚Äôili‚Äôili ma FogƒÅvaiuta‚Äô) continue to govern Falefa down to the present day. Other sub- villages followed; Saleapaga followed by Sagogu and Gagaeimalae. Moe'ono and Leutele bestowed titles on prominent houses and established 'vassal' houses to serve Moe'ono and Leutele to assist with the administration of the growing district. The brothers and their respective heirs traveled extensively throughout their dominion - from Lemafatele (known as Le Mafa Pass today) to Sasoa'a (where Lapita pottery remains have been found), to Fagaloa and the mountains overlooking the valley below where the village of Falefa stands today.  Growth and new villages formed  In later times, portions of Falefa's lands were gifted by subsequent rulers to form the settlements of Lufilufi, Lalomauga, Falevao as well as the villages of Sauano and Saletele in the Fagaloa Bay. Tui Atua Leutele-le'i'ite also gifted land to his nephew Puga (or Puna) to form the village of Faleapuna. Puna subsequently became a leading orator in the Atua district under the new title of Molio'o, until it became part of the Vaa-o-Fonoti district. These villages are historically tied to Falefa through their founding and centuries of intricate political interactions. War: Falefa stands with Fonoti  One of the early kings of Samoa was Faumuina, a direct descendant of Queen Salamasina. He had three children, two sons and one daughter. The sons were named Fonoti and Vaafusuaga and the daughter was named Samalaulu. They are commonly known in the traditions of Samoa as ‚ÄúThe Three of Faumuina.‚Äù Each child was by a different mother so that after the death of their father they individually contended for the Kingship. Having waged war successfully for the crown against his kin, Fonoti was ultimately proclaimed King in c.1640. He conferred many honours upon those chiefs and Districts that had fought for him and such honours and privileges are remembered and passed down by Samoa's Tulafale (Orator chiefs) down to the present day. For contending with Manono, Sapapali'i and Saleaaumua naval forces and securing his victory at sea, the leaders of Faleapuna and Fagaloa were granted a district of their own called Vaa-o-Fonoti (literally, Fonoti's canoe). For leading Fonoti's land forces and securing victory on land, Falefa was designated the salutation of Aai o Fonoti or Aai o le Tupu (the village of Fonoti or village of the King). Falefa continued as the administrative centre of Fonoti, Muagututi'a and Tupua's respective malo until the time of Fonoti's grandson, King Afoa (later Afoafouvale), who chose to rule from Lufilufi, the centre of ƒÄtua. These honors are reflected to this day in the Fa'alupega o Samoa (customary honorific salutations of Samoa) of the respective villages and in those of Falefa. 'Aiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao and their Tama a 'ƒÄiga, Tupua (later known as 'Tupua Tamasese')  365x365pxThe pƒÅpƒÅ titles confer upon individual holders authority over designated territory (Tui Atua rules Atua, Tui A'ana rules A'ana etc.) or, in the case of a Tafa'ifƒÅ (holder of all four pƒÅpƒÅ titles) status as King or Queen of all Samoa. However, these titles are usually contested exclusively among Samoa's royal lineages, each with a paramount title holder and a titular figure whom the lineage is named after and in whom the mana (honour) of the family is represented. These are called tama-a-'ƒÅiga ('sons of the families', i.e. the four paramount families of Samoa). Tupua Tamasese is the tama of the SƒÅ Fenunuivao aiga, one of the primary political families of Samoa based in Falefa and Salani. King Muagututi'a, son of King Fonoti, married Fenunuivao, daughter of Leutele of Falefa. Because they had no children of their own, they adopted Fenunuivao's nephew Fuiavailili, from Salani, as their son and heir. Upon his arrival in Falefa, he was given the name 'Tupua' and was thereafter known as Tupua Fuiavailili, the first Tama-a-'ƒÅiga. As the child was now the sole heir to King Muagututi'a, the powerful orator groups of Pule and Tumua performed their customary right of saesae laufa'i (investigating one's genealogical links) enquiring as to whether he possessed the necessary genealogical links in order to be worthy of tafa'ifa honours. Thus it was revealed that Fuiavailili's biological father was Fuimaono, and biological mother Sa'ilau, descendants of Fanene and direct descendants of Queen Salamasina's son and second child, Tapumanaia. King Muagututi'a himself was descended from Queen SalamƒÅsina's eldest child, Fofoaivao'ese. Thus it was that Tupua Fuiavailili, through both ancestral lines, was the first ruler of Samoa to have inherited from both of Queen SalamƒÅsina's children, re-uniting the Salamasina lineages through his ancestor, Tapumanaia, SalamƒÅsina's husband (from the Fuimaono and Fanene line), and Muagututi'a's ancestor Fofoaivao'ese, Salamasina's daughter with from a previous relationship with Alapepe, (from the Fonoti, Muagututi'a line). Having satisfied the requirements of having direct lineage to SalamƒÅsina and demonstrable link to both lineages and prominent families, Tupua Fuiavailili was proclaimed the first Tama a 'ƒÄiga and succeeded Muagututi'a to becoming King ('Tupu Tafa'ifƒÅ' ).  The Aloali'i: Luafalemana.  From his four usuga (marriages), King Tupua Fuiavailili had five children. Two went on to become King, while the third went on to becoming one of the ancestors of Atua's other tama-a-'ƒÅiga title: Mata'afa. The beginnings of the tama-a-'ƒÅiga MatƒÅ'afa lineage is traced through to Luafalemana, son of King Tupua Fuiavailili. This was enabled through the union of Luafalemana's daughter, Salaina'oloa of 'Aiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao with Tuimavave (also known as Tauili'ili) of 'Aiga SƒÅ LevƒÅlasi , issuing one of the progenitors of the MatƒÅ'afa title, Fa'asuamale'aui, in 1785. Tuimavave's other union with Letelesa issued the another progenitor of the title, Silupevailei. These two lines of Fa'asuamale'aui and Silupevailei are from whom all Mata'afa are selected. Family traditions differ on who was the first Mata'afa, but the majority of opinion favours Tafagamanu, grandson of Fa'asuamale'aui. Tuimavave's union with Tupua's grand-daughter, Salaina'oloa, has resulted in the Luafalemana title's association with both the Tupua Tamasese and the MatƒÅ'afa titles. Several MatƒÅ'afa holders from Falefa also held the Tupua title concurrently, like MatƒÅ'afa Iosefo who became known as Tupua MatƒÅ'afa Iosefo. By joining the daughter of Luafalemana with Tuimavave, the Tui Atua line arrives at a harmonious junction between the two great Tama-a-'ƒÅiga families of Atua - 'Aiga SƒÅ LevƒÅlasi and 'Aiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao. *Luafalemana of FalefƒÅ, From Tupua's first marriage to Punipuao, daughter of Ala'iasa. Ancestor of the MatƒÅ'afa tama-a-'ƒÅiga through his daughter Salaina'oloa, who married Tuimavave of the Aiga SƒÅ Levalasi and sired the elder Mata'afa line of Faasuamale'aui. *Afoa of Palauli. Succeeded his father to become King and ruled from Lufilufi. Defeated in single combat by his brother, Galumalemana. Later named Afoafouvale, after his defeat. Galumalemana of Saleimoa. Succeeded his brother Afoa as King by defeating him at Maauga, Leulumoega. The current line of Tupua are from this line of descent and it was from among his descendants - Tamasese Titimaea - that Tamasese became part of the title, hence Tupua Tamasese * Tautisusua and Tufugatasi, from Tupua's fourth marriage to Matavaoilesasa. Collectively, these titles are known as Aloali'i (Dauphins or heirs). The establishment of the institution of aloalii ensured the continuation of the Tupua's political influence through his descendants and to maintain in perpetuam the genealogical linkages between the first Tupu Tafa'ifa, Queen Salamasina and later Tupu Tafa'ifa, King Fonoti, from whom later rulers would draw legitimacy.  Politics & Governance  Falefa means the 'House of Four', indicative of the four sub-villages which make up the main components of Falefa; Sagogu, Gagaemalae, Saleapaga, Sagapolu. Each of these sub villages comprise families, the heads of which, represent their extended families and their respective area at Falefa's Village Council, headed by the two senior tulafale-alii of the village (Matua), Moe'ono & 'Iuli. Falefa is administered and governed by Leutele, Lealaisalanoa, Alai'asƒÅ as the Alii (Chiefs) of Falefa and by both Matua (elder Orator-Chiefs or 'tulafale-alii') Moe'ono and 'Iuli. Leutele is the ranking alii of the village and Moe'ono is the ranking tulafale-alii. Lealaisalanoa is the second ranking alii with Alai'asƒÅ the third. 'Iuli is the tulafale-alii of Lealaisalanoa and is the other matua of Falefa. Leutele is addressed as TinƒÅ o Tupua (Tupua's Mother), honoring the first Tupua's mother Fenunuivao and maternal Grandfather, Leutele. Moe'ono is customarily addressed as \\"le tamƒÅ o le nu'u\\" ('the father of the village') and alongside Tofua'iofo'ia is the principal spokespersons for Aiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao, Tupua's political family and heirs. The establishment of Moe'ono and Leutele titles predate the Tongan period, as the primordial holders were the sons of Tui Atua Mua'iteleloa (one of the earliest holders of the Tui Atua pƒÅpƒÅ title) and founders of Falefa somewhere between 300B.C - 200 A.D.  Protocol: The Selection of the Moe'ono & the Leutele  The late Moe'ono Alai'asƒÅ Kolio OBE (Moe'ono from 1957-1987), one of the signatories of the Constitution, pictured here with his wife, Aniva Atoafuaiupolu -Auva'a of Tanugamanono & Ti'aveaUpon the death of a Moe'ono or Leutele, the district goes into an extended period of mourning and kicks off the procession of cultural protocol which follows. Leutele, Iuli and Lealaisalanoa‚Äôs funeral rites will commence with the Lagi (sacred offering of rare fine mats and offerings) which is received by the Moe'ono. The funeral rites of a Moe'ono however, do not customarily include a Lagi as these offerings given during a Moe'ono‚Äôs funeral rites remain with Moe'ono‚Äôs family. This custom has since changed since the time of Moe'ono Kolio whose funeral rites included a Lagi. During this sede vacante period, the administration of Falefa is then passed to 'Iuli, Lealaisalanoa, Alai'asƒÅ and Falefa's other matai (chiefs of each family) until a Moe'ono or Leutele is appointed. At the appointed time when an heir has been chosen, the proceedings of the saofa'i (bestowment ceremony) stipulate that only the two bearers of the titles of the two brothers - Moe'ono and Leutele - are part of this sacred ritual. Only once it has been completed with the completion of the 'ava ceremony and the title bestowed will 'Iuli lead the rest of the village chiefs in to the residence to join them ('usu le nuu'). The ceremony is guarded by Tupua ma le Aumaga (the name for Falefa's untitled men's guild). The last holder of the Leutele title was Leutele Tapusatele Keli Tuatagaloa until his passing in 2012. The late Moe'ono Leateafaiga Atoafuaiupolu Penitito Alaiasa is the most recent holder of the Moe'ono title, which he held until his passing in 2018. The two titles have enjoyed a long tradition of only ever having a single holder of the respective titles at any given time, save for a brief period when there were multiple Leutele title holders. As of 2018, both titles remain vacant pending appointment of the new holders by the respective heirs.  Lautivunia: The Tui Tonga and Tui Atua Leutelelei'ite  The Tui Tonga (ruler of Tonga) had two sons. The elder was named Tuitonga after his father, the younger, Lautivunia. Lautivunia had an affair with his brother's wife. When the affair became known, the older brother was very angry. As is the custom, the younger brother made a peace offering of cooked food wrapped in tolo (ordinary sugar cane) and fiso (wild sugar cane) leaves. These leaves underlined the message, ‚ÄòPlease forgive me, for we are brothers.‚Äô The late Leutele Tapusatele Keli Tuatagaloa, ranking alii of Falefa. (1940-2012). But Tuitoga was not placated and Lautivunia made another peace offering, which included the flesh of ordinary bananas and of the lei (wild banana). The two varieties of banana underlined the message, ‚ÄòWe are flesh and blood ‚Äì surely you can find it in your heart to forgive me?‚Äô Tuitoga was still not placated. So Lautivunia decided that if his brother would not accept his food offerings he would offer his life. He dug a hole where his catamaran was housed, fixed spears with points upward at the bottom of the hole, and threw himself on the spears. The force of his action caused the surrounding earth and sand to cave in and cover him. When Lautivunia's disappearance was noticed, his father and brother sent out search parties to look for him. One party reached Falefa, Samoa. Tui Atua Leutele said, ‚ÄòYou need not have come so far. Lautivunia is in Tonga under his catamaran.‚Äô So the search party returned to Tonga and found the body of Lautivunia. The Tui Toga felt obliged to reciprocate this favour from Tui Atua Leutele and instructed the search party to return to Samoa with the finest of his fine mats, which he named Le Ageagea o Tumua (the substance of Tumua). In addition, he recognised Tui Atua Leutele's seer abilities by naming him Leutele Leiite, that is, Leutele with the prophetic powers. The title of Leiite survives today as one of the titles of the SƒÅ Leutele family.  The Ravages of War: 'Iuli Potini calls for Peace  In later centuries, a great war between Tuamasaga and the two allies, Atua and A'ana ravaged the country. Having been defeated, Malietoa Uitualagi and the Tuamasaga army sought refuge at Ana o Seuao in Sa'anapu, Safata. Atua and A'ana forces gave chase and as they arrived at Ana, prepared to complete their victory by burning the entire region and killing off the rest of Malietoa's troops. The stage was set for perhaps the most celebrated of all Samoan orations. Among the warriors of Atua was the orator (tulafale) Iuli Potini of Falefa; and he it was, who, in an effort to save the people of Tuamasaga from the peril which confronted them, spoke with unflagging fervour for two full days and nights entreating the leaders of Atua and A'ana to have mercy on their captives. His oration was not, however, a disinterested appeal, for in the cave together with her husband, Pulemagafa‚Äîan orator (tulafale) of Fangali'i (a village in Tuamasaga), was the daughter of Iuli and her two children. The daughter's name is said to have been Talalaufala, and her two children were Salamaleulu, a girl, and Falefataali'i, a boy. This boy Falefataali'i, was the sole surviving male descendant of Iuli Potini and would upon Iuli's death have inherited his lands and title. According to Samoan custom he would be termed ‚Äúo le gafa mal≈ç o Iuli‚Äù, and his position is one of great importance. It was in an attempt then to preserve the life of this boy and so maintain his family line intact that Iuli spoke for so long and with such vehemence. Iuli's remarkable oration is still remembered throughout all Samoa in the expression: ‚ÄúO se Iuli‚Äù which is used in reference to any orator who speaks with great persistence and to great length. The tract of land in which the cave lies is still known as Potini in memory of Iuli. Iuli's words were heard by the people of Tuamasaga, and the nature of his oration was conveyed to Malietoa and the other chiefs and orators within the cave. Pulemagafa, too, must have heard the story of Iuli's plea, and old and blind as he was, he made his way forward to the mouth of the cave guided by his son Falefataali'i. As he groped his way he was assailed by the taunts of his fellow captives, for to them he was making but a hopeless gesture. He pressed on however until gaining the mouth of the cave, and questioning his son so as to determine the identity of those without, he made an oration in reply to Iuli and the chiefs and orators of Atua and A'ana, pleading for deliverance. Pulemagafa's earnest appeal was poorly received, for great was the rancour between the warring districts, until he announced that Malietoa was willing to pay as ransom (togiola, which literally means, ‚Äòthe price of one's life') the island of Tutuila. Such an offer was eagerly grasped, and before long the great sailing canoes of Atua were heading eastward to claim the prize, while Malietoa and his crest-fallen followers returned to their villages. This famous incident is still remembered in the proverb‚Äî‚ÄúUa tosi fa'alauti le eleele o Tutuila‚Äù (The land of Tutuila has been torn to shreds even as the strands of a native skirt), and to this day many of the village names and chiefly titles of Tutuila still bear witness to the nature of their origin, derived directly as they were from the district of Atua. For his efforts in ending the conflict, 'Iuli Potini was elevated from tulafale to tulafale-alii and given the rank of Matua by Moe'ono and Leutele. Furthermore, his kava cup was named ‚ÄúLau ipu lenei; lua po, lua ao‚Äù (This is your kava cup: ‚ÄòThe two nights and the two days‚Äô). Thus is the feat of his famous ancestor still commemorated and today, his descendant 'Iuli continues to govern Falefa alongside Moe'ono and Leutele.  The March to Independence: Moe'ono & The Mau Movement  In the early days of the Mau movement, the aloali'i Luafalemana Moe'ono Ta'ele resigned from his post at the administration's Native Police to assist with efforts to garner national support for the fledgling independence movement. As Pule (the orators and polity heads of Savaii) were yet to pledge their unanimous support, Luafalemana Moe'ono Ta'ele was tasked with leading a fleet of fautasi (canoes) together with Upolu's orators Tumua to ask for Savaii's support. Choosing to arrive at Satupa'itea instead of Sale'aula, Moe'ono recalled Falefa's earlier support for the Mau a Pule (which Savaii's orators had led during the German administration, a precursor to the Mau Movement) and called on Asiata to have Pule (Savaii's orator polity and counterpart to Upolu's Tumua) reciprocate their solidarity by joining forces with them in order to further strengthen the cause for independence. His son, Moe'ono Alai'asƒÅ Kolio OBE, would later become one of the Framers of the Constitution of the newly Independent State of Western Samoa.  The Village Fono: FalefƒÅ, Falelima & Falefitu  The convocation of a special meeting of the village fono is decided by 'Iuli or Moe'ono. The scale of the meeting varies depending on the situation. The most common meetings comprise only the four sub-villages of Falefa: Sagapolu, Saleapaga, Gaga‚Äôemalae and Sanonu. The range of participants define the three types of meetings. In this context, the word fale means sub-village. A fono falefa is then a fono in which only the matai from the four sub-villages of Falefa participate. A fono falelima is a fono with the four sub-villages of Falefa and the village of Falevao. A fono falefitu involves all the villages that are part of Falefa's traditional domain, which includes the four sub- villages of Falefa, Falevao and the two villages of Sauano and Saletele in the Fagaloa Bay.  Title Contention and Controversies   Disputes over the Tupua Tamasese title 342x342pxFalefa and the Tupua Tamasese have a long history, dating back to when the first Tupua was installed at Falefa in c.1550. In terms of succession to the title, the family has been among the least controversial of all Tama a 'ƒÄiga families. Family consensus decided successors rather than the court. However, these amicable relations were eventually fractured in 1965 when a major split appeared over the successor to Samoa's former co-Head of State Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole, who died in 1963. Two first cousins and sons of previous holders vied for the title and the family was forced to resort to the court for a settlement. The family had been unable to agree between two candidates, Lealofi IV, the son of assassinated Mau leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, and Tufuga Efi, the son of Samoa's former co-Head of State Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole. The two men were first cousins, and their fathers had both held the titles. After deliberations dissolved, both were subsequently installed at separate ceremonies by the different political families of SƒÅ Tupua: Lealofi IV by 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao of Falefa and Salani, and Tufuga Efi by 'ƒÄiga o Mavaega (of Faleasi'u and Asau in Savai'i) and by a branch of 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Tuala from Fasito'outa. The latter's installation took 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao by surprise and was immediately met with stern rejection. Both candidates were genealogically eligible, being descended from their common ancestor, Tupua Fuiavailili.LC8384 pp. 1-4, 6 August 1987 However, Lealofi had the advantage of having the unanimous support of 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao, the title's main political family, on the grounds that his father was older then Tufuga Efi's father and he himself was the elder candidate. The subsequent court battle saw a unanimous endorsement of Lealofi IV's appointment.LC2440, 29 March 1965. The court ruled that the pule of the Tupua title...is vested in the family of SƒÅ Fenunuivao of FalefƒÅ and Salani. However, Tufuga Efi's supporters returned to the court to press two more lines of argument. First they argued that the title should be appointed and conferred by the suli (immediate heirs of recent holders). 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao agreed, but pointed out their right to step in and decide, especially seeing as there would inevitably be disagreement among descendants and pointing to the fact that SƒÅ Fenunuivao were descendants themselves, a view also endorsed by the court. Second, Tufuga's supporters argued that the conjugate titles - Tupua and Tamasese - be split in two. They argued that the Tamasese name constituted a title in its own right and urged the court to award the Tupua title to Lealofi and the Tamasese title to Tufuga Efi. However, the court rejected this argument on the grounds that without Tupua, Tamasese could not be constituted as a title and that Tupua without Tamasese would disqualify Tupua from the rank of a Tama a 'ƒÄiga. The court ruled in favour of 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao's candidate, Lealofi IV who would go on to be elected Prime Minister of Samoa. Upon Tupua Tamasese Lealofi IV's death in 1983, the question as to a successor was raised yet again with Tupuola Efi once again staking his claim. However, this would require 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao agreeing to his appointment. Salani agreed however, Falefa and Lufilufi opposed. Despite the stalemate, Tupuola Efi pressed his claim and proceeded without the unanimous support of ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao. On the morning of his installation ceremony at Vaimoso, the nation's public broadcaster, Radio 2AP, read an announcement from the Moe'ono at the time, Moe'ono Alai'asƒÅ Kolio, notifying the country that 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao as well as the leaders of Lufilufi had not sanctioned Tupuola Efi's ascension to the title and would not allow for the ceremony to proceed at the title's appurtenant maota at Mulinu'≈´ ma Sepolata'emo in Lufilufi. This effectively nullified Tupuola Efi's grasp for the title yet again. In 1986, Tupuola Efi approached the now ailing Moe'ono Kolio to ask for ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao's unanimous blessing. Despite their initial refusal, both Falefa and Lufilufi eventually agreed. Thus 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao joined with 'ƒÄiga o Mavaega and 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Tuala to jointly confer the Tupua Tamasese title on Tupuola Efi in an installation ceremony at Vaimoso in November, 1986, jointly registering the title under their family names. However, the right of joint conferral was later challenged in court, with the main families within the Sa Tupua clan - SƒÅ Fenunuivao, SƒÅ Tuala and Aiga 'o Mavaega - disputing authority over the title. The matter was decisively settled when in 1987, the court ruled that the right of conferral of the Tupua Tamasese title belonged exclusively to 'ƒÄiga SƒÅ Fenunuivao of Falefa and Salani.

It is within the political district of Va'a-o-Fonoti and is also part of a conservation zone called the Uafato Conservation Area. The village is one of nine small village settlements situated at Fagaloa Bay. It is surrounded by the Uafato Tiavea Conservation Zone with lush rainforest, rugged topography, waterfalls and coral reefs. Village Carving a kava bowl Carved Samoan weapons Uafato village is the most eastern of the villages in the bay and nestled between the sea and rainforest mountains. Access to Uafato village is by a narrow access road leading from Fagaloa Bay. Like most villages in Samoa, the people of Uafato maintain a traditional lifestyle and culture governed by fa'a Samoa, the matai chiefly system and va tapu'ia interaction with their natural environment. The rainforest remains an important economic base for the local people. The forests surrounding the village contains one of the largest remaining stands of a native hardwood tree ifilele (Intsia bijuga) with many uses in Samoan culture including housebuilding and carving. The village is a centre for traditional woodcarving where visitors can watch carvers making kava bowls, war clubs and other local crafts. Like women in most villages in Samoa, the women of Uafato weave finely woven mats, fans and handicrafts which are an important source of income for their families. The reputation of the local woodcarvers has grown over the last two decades and the carvers of Uafato supply the craft markets in the capital Apia. Most of the techniques used in crafting the traditional artwork is much the same as they were prior to western contact. The village is an hour and a half from the country's capital Apia and a visit can be undertaken in a day. There are beach fale accommodation where visitors may stay overnight or for day trips. Uafato Conservation Area The conservation area is ancestral land owned by the families of Uafato. The conservation zone includes the village and Fagaloa Bay and approximately 1,300 hectares of forestlands. Fauna includes two varieties of bat and 22 bird species including the endangered tooth-billed pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris), also known as Samoan pigeon which are confined to undisturbed forests. It is the national bird of Samoa and is called the Manumea. The initiative for a conservation area came from the chiefs and the village following cyclones in 1991 which destroyed much of the village. The council of chiefs approached a private environmental group, O Le Siosiomaga Society, for assistance. A year later, the Uafato Conservation Area was established with funding from the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (formerly SPREP). Alaifue Lisale died in 2010, and Vaisa Laumea 66 years old was named the High Chief of Uafato at Christmas 2009. Mythology *There are different stories for the origins of the name Uafato. One story tells of the name originating from the stacking of humans to build Lufasiaitu's house made of 100 human poles. One human was made to stand on the neck (ua) of the other to make one pole. Thus, the origin of the chiefly title 'Faleselau' (fale meaning house, selau - hundred) which bears reference to the hundred poles of Lufasiaitu's house. *Another story relates that the supreme god Tagaloa lived in the ninth heaven above Uafato village.

In some sense, it is a type of hybrid dysgenesis when the growth disorder proves deleterious, making it the opposite of heterosis or hybrid vigour. Hybrid growth disorders may be referred to as a growth dysplasia, especially when resulting in overgrowth, although this terminology may be confusing since the term dysplasia is commonly used to imply an impending cancer. However, a hybrid growth disorder is not caused by cancer. Hybrid growth disorders are exhibited among a variety organisms, including ligers, tigons, hybrid mice, and hybrid dwarf hamsters. A study on hybrid mice which investigated the possible causes for hybrid growth disorders reveals genomic imprinting to have a major effect. Paternal imprinting may increase growth to maximize maternal resources allocated to his progeny, while maternal imprinting may suppress growth in favor of ensuring her own survival and equal allocation of resources between offspring. This suggests that the extent of a disorder depends on the combination of parental species and their respective sexes, as demonstrated by the Vrana study. The study concludes that hybrid growth disorders most commonly affect the heterozygous sex, as expected by Haldane's rule. This would also explain why hybrid growth disorders often appear to affect one sex more than the other. Similarly, a study of hybrids between dwarf hamster species Phodopus campbelli and Phodopus sungorus suggests that gene imprinting causes abnormal interactions between growth-promoting and growth-repressing genes which regulate placental and embryonic growth.

One, the Poor Sisters of St. Francis, is based in her native Germany, and the other, the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, was later formed from its province in the United States. She was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church in 1974. Early life Frances Schervier () was born into a wealthy family in Aachen, Germany. Her father, Johann Heinrich Schervier, was a wealthy needle factory owner and the vice-mayor of Aachen. Her French mother, Maria Louise Migeon, the goddaughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria, provided a strict home environment. After the death of both her mother and two sisters from tuberculosis when she was thirteen, Schervier became the homemaker for her father, and developed a reputation for generosity to the poor, from her growing awareness of their desperate conditions. In a dispute over the rights of the Catholic Church in 1837 (K√∂lner Wirren), the Prussian government imprisoned the Archbishop of Cologne, Clemens August von Droste-Vischering, causing a great public reaction; the repercussion was a revival of religious spirit, especially in Westphalia and the Rhine country. In the wake of this spiritual awakening, some prominent Aachen ladies started a society for the relief of the poor and approached Schervier's father, Johann, to permit Schervier to join. He agreed at first, but later demurred when she began to nurse the sick in their homes, fearing that she might carry the disease into his own house. Joseph Istas, who was curate at Saint Paul Parish in Aachen and founder of \\"Saint John's Kitchen\\" for the poor, deeply impressed Schervier, who began to work very closely with him; but their friendship ended abruptly with Istas' premature death in 1843. The following year she and four other young ladies (Catherine Daverkosen, Gertrude Frank, Joanna Bruchhans, and Catherine Lassen) became president members of the Third Order of St. Francis. Founder In 1845 Schervier's life took an unexpected turn: her father died and a family friend, Getrude Frank, told Schervier that she was called to serve God and He would show her in whose company. She considered joining the Trappistines, but instead of entering an existing convent, on 3 October 1845 she and four other women left their homes to establish a religious community devoted to caring for the poor under Schervier's leadership. With the permission of a priest, they went to live together in a small house beyond St. James's Gate, and Schervier was chosen superior of the community. The life of the Sisters was conventual, and their time spent in religious exercises, household duties, and caring for the sick poor. They formed the nucleus of the community that became known as the Poor Sisters of St. Francis. From 1845 until 1848, the Sisters continued to care for the sick in their homes and to operate a soup kitchen. They also cared for prostitutes in their own small home and nursed women suffering from syphilis. Relying entirely upon donations for support, the Sisters experienced extreme poverty. The pre-revolutionary potato and grain failures and the refusal of some benefactors to continue their assistance once the Sisters began ministering to prostitutes, intensified their difficulties. More women joined the group in 1849, expanding the ministry beyond Aachen; not only did they care for victims of cholera, smallpox, typhoid fever, and cancer, but they also supervised women prisoners at the Aachen prison and assisted them in finding employment after their release. The congregation obtained formal church recognition from the local bishop on 2 July 1851, despite some authorities' objections to Schervier's severe position regarding personal poverty.Jeiler, P. I. The Venerable Mother Frances Schervier Foundress of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Poor of Saint Francis: a Sketch of her Life and Character, (trans. by Bonaventura Hammer) 3d ed St. Louis, Missouri: B. Herder ,1924 Soon after receiving formal recognition as a religious congregation, they spread their service overseas. An American foundation was established within seven years, to serve German emigrant communities in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and northern Kentucky. At the same time Schervier oversaw the foundation of several hospitals and sanatoria in both Europe and the United States for those suffering from tuberculosis, then a widespread cause of death, especially among the working classes. In 1857, she encouraged Philip Hoever, a Franciscan tertiary, in his efforts to establish the Poor Brothers of St. Francis. Like the Sisters, they are a religious congregation of lay brothers of the Franciscan Third Order Regular, instituted for charitable work among orphan boys and educating the youth of the poorer classes. Schervier visited the United States in 1863, and helped her Sisters nurse soldiers wounded in the American Civil War. St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, New Jersey, was founded for this work. She visited the United States one more time in 1868. During this second visit, she attended the dedication of the new location of the St. Elizabeth Hospital in Covington, Kentucky, staffed by twelve sisters of her congregation. Legacy When Schervier died, there were 2,500 members of her congregation worldwide. The number kept growing until the 1970s, when, like many other religious orders, they began to experience a sharp decline in membership. After a formal investigation into her life requested of the Holy See by the Archbishop of Cincinnati and the declaration of a miraculous cure of a man in Ohio, Schervier was beatified in 1974 by Pope Paul VI. In 1959, the American province of the congregation separated from the German branch, to become an independent congregation called the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor. They have their headquarters in Brooklyn, New York. They are still engaged in operating a hospital and a home for the aged in Walden, New York, but have transferred the ownership of many of their institutions to other organizations. The Frances Schervier Home and Hospital was founded by the Sisters in the Bronx, New York, and named in her honor. (It too has been transferred as of 2000 to a medical chain but continues to operate under this name.) Currently this Congregation focuses on health care, pastoral ministries, and social service. Veneration Frances Schervier died in Aachen, Germany, on December 14, 1876. In 1934 the Apostolic Process was opened in Rome, Decree issued for Introduction of the Cause of Mary Frances Schervier, of the Third Order Regular of Saint Francis. On January 30, 1969, Pope Paul VI proclaimed the \\"heroicity of the virtues\\" of Schervier and declared her \\"Venerable\\". On October 18, 1972, Pope Paul VI, on appeal by the Right Rev. Johannes Pohlschneider, Bishop of Aachen, grants an apostolic dispensation from the prescript contained in Canon 2117 of the Code of Canon Law, so that, after a legally valid verification and full examination of only one miracle, the cause might pass to the next phase. In 1973 the \\"medically inexplicable\\" and sudden cure of Mr. Ludwig Braun from a life-threatening pancreatic and intestinal ailment was recognized as the miracle necessary for the beatification of Schervier. The decree recognizing the miracle was signed on October 18, 1973, by Pope Paul VI. Schervier was beatified on April 28, 1974, in Rome by Pope Paul VI, and became \\"Blessed Frances\\".Seligsprechung von schwester Franziska Schervier vatican.va, article in German In March 1989 an unexplainable and sudden cure was experienced by Mr. Thomas Siemers, who had a massive brain hemorrhage. Three medical doctors had no scientific explanation: one said it was \\"divine intervention\\" and another said \\"somebody up there likes him.\\" In 2008 The Cause for Canonization of Blessed Frances Schervier was introduced in Rome on July 16 jointly by Sister Tiziana Merletti, S.F.P., Congregational Minister of the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor, and Sister Katharina Maria Finken, S.P.S.F., Superior General of the Poor Sisters of St. Francis. In 2009 The Opening Session of the Diocesan Inquiry Process took place on April 17 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to gather evidence on the cure of Mr. Thomas Siemers, with a closing session on December 14. On March 17, 2010, the official documents from the Diocesan Inquiry in Cincinnati were opened in Rome.

He began in the late 1960s and had his first hit with Rikiatou. His African Typic Collection was an international hit in 1984 and is perhaps his best known album.Calabash Music Thomas began his career in the early 1970s as a guitarist in the Cameroonian band Tigres Noires. He stayed with that band until 1976, when he launched his solo career.Leon Jackson, All Music Guide Career He started his musical career in 1968 when he joined The Black Tigers, led by Andre Marie Tala. He stayed with Tala for eight years, recording several singles. The band also recorded in Paris and toured Senegal and other African countries. During this period Tala developed his Tchamassi rhythm, a modern music style based on Bamilike folklore. In 1976, Sam's first solo LP was Funky New Bell, recorded in Benin on the Satel label. A second LP, on the same label, followed in 1977. On this album Sam was supported by the Black Santiagos from Benin. His third release came in 1982 in Nigeria, with the hit song \\"Rikiatou\\", which established his reputation in Cameroon. In 1983 Thomas travelled to Paris to record Makassi. Makassi is the name of Sam's own music style, a type of uptempo Makossa blended with a touch of Andre Marie Tala's Tchamassi and other Bamilike influences. The album contained the hit song \\"African Typic Collection\\". This song built around the melody of the classic Franco song \\"Boma l'heure\\" and became an international dance floor hit, with sales across Africa, France and the West Indies where it was also released as a 12-inch single. Makassi brought Sam a Golden Disc in 1984 and was followed by his fifth album 'Neng Makassi in 1985. The album retained the sophisticated production of Makassi, without matching his greatest hit. In 1986 he came with two albums, Funk Makassi and Makassi Plus. The latter became a hit. Together with \\"African Typic Collection\\", two tracks off Makassi Plus were released in 1987 on a compilation by the British Earthworks record label. Makassi Plus was followed in 1988 by Makassi Again that was distributed internationally by the Celluloid record label. Thomas also toured with his band MBC (Makassi Band Corporation) in West and East Africa, Europe and the Americas. From the early 1990s Thomas changed his focus from recording his own material, to promotion and guiding new talented Cameroonian singers and musicians. He gathered talented musicians, including the late Kotto Bass, Ebelle Jeannot, K.Godefroy, Fabo Claude, Guy Bilong and Tala Jeannot, at Makassi Plus Studio in Douala. He released a string of records from various artists during the 1990s. Thomas released new material in 1993's Emotion and 1999's No Satisfaction. None of these CD's brought him the success of his earlier work. He performed successful shows in Nairobi (2007), the US (2009) and Abidjan (2010). Famous for a genre of music that captivated several parts of Africa to mention Kenya, Uganda, Congo. The music followed the unique but familiar flow of Bantu lingo that encompasses most of Africa.

It lies within the electoral constituency of Gaga'ifomauga. Safune is the birthplace of Mau leader Olaf Frederick Nelson and the filming location of Moana (1926 film), one of the first documentaries made in the world. The Mata o le Alelo pool associated with the Sina and the Eel Polynesian legend is also in Safune. The villages within Safune are Matavai, Faletagaloa and Fatuvalu as well as smaller traditional land boundaries, Faleolo and Lalomati. Olaf Frederick Nelson Olaf Frederick Nelson, a leader of the Mau, Samoa's independence movement during the colonial era in the early 1900s, was born in Safune on 24 February 1883. Nelson's father was a Swedish immigrant trader. His mother Sina Masoe was from Safune. In 1900, at the age of 17, Nelson worked for his father's store in Safune. When his father retired in 1903, Nelson expanded the family business. In 1904, he purchased a boat called 'Lily' to ship copra to sell in Apia. By 1906 he was shipping directly to Sydney. He set up trading stations on Savai'i and Upolu. Nelson went on to become one of the wealthiest men in Samoa. In 1928, the colonial administration exiled Nelson to New Zealand for his leadership in the Mau movement.

The pool is looked after by women in the village and is open to visitors and tourists. The legend explains the origins of the first coconut tree. Pre-history The name Sa Fune (the family of Fune) is associated with a man called Fune, a warrior who established his court in a number of villages in Savai'i. Fune is believed to have been the first holder of the Le Tagaloa chief title in the 10th century. Democracy and custom in SƒÅmoa: an uneasy alliance by Asofou So ªo, p.3 Another story relates that Fune and Fotu were the children of Lafai. Fune founded Safune and Fotu founded Safotu. Both villages were warlike. People from Safune had a war with the people of Faleata and many people were killed. O Samoa Anamua by Siaosi Tana, p.198, 1884. Retrieved 27 October 2009 London Missionary Society The London Missionary Society, which was established by evangelical Anglicans and Nonconformists, largely Congregationalist in outlook, was active in the 19th Century. Rev. Dr. Alexander MacDonald and his wife Selina Dorcas (n√©e Blomfield) settled at Safune in August 1837. He left the LMS in 1850 when he accepted a position with the Congregational church in Auckland, New Zealand. The making of a film in Safune Moana (1926), one of the first documentary films made in the world, was filmed in Safune and directed by Robert J. Flaherty who lived in the village for more than a year. Transcultural English Studies: Theories, Fictions, Realities by Sissy Helff, p. 211 Flaherty was in Samoa from April 1923 to December 1924. He went to Samoa with his wife Frances Flaherty, their three young children, a red-haired Irish nursemaid (nicknamed 'Mumu' or 'Red' by the Samoans) and Flaherty's younger brother David Flaherty who would act as the film production manager.http://astro.temple.edu/~ruby/wava//Flaherty/chap2.html The tropical landscape of Safune was very different from the frozen icy setting of Flaherty's previous film Nanook of the North. Frederick O'Brien (1869 - 1932),http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2283305 a successful travel writer in America in the 1920s (Atolls of the Sun, Mystic Isles of the South Seas) had stayed for several months in Safune and recommended the village to Flaherty as a location for his film., Facing the Pacific: Polynesia and the U.S. imperial imagination By Jeffrey Geiger, p. 75 O'Brien's first travel book 'White Shadows in the South Seas' (1919) had created a lot of public interest in the South Pacific among Americans. When the Flahertys arrived in Safune they stayed in a house that was a former trading post set among coconut trees. This was the same house in which O'Brien had stayed two years earlier. Their host was a German trader Felix David, who had lived in Samoa for many years. The German had trained as an opera singer in his youth in Europe and provided evening recitals in the village including operatic renditions of Siegfried's death scene from G√∂tterd√§mmerung. Flaherty made the film in Safune with the approval of the chiefs (matai), of whom the filmmaker noted as being proud of their home being chosen as the location. The German trader David acted as his go-between with the locals. The villagers called Flaherty 'Ropati' or 'Lopati,' a transliteration of 'Robert.' Sixteen tonnes of film equipment arrived in the village. A cave in the village was converted into a film processing laboratory and two young men, Samuelo and Imo, from the village, were trained to work there. Flaherty exposed about 240,000 feet of negative on the Safune family, a large amount of footage developed and printed by hand in a cave with two Samoan boys who had no prior film training. After a year of filming, a problem showed up in the developed negative, caused by the salinity content of the water from the pool in the cave laboratory. The problem was fixed by using rainwater, but prior footage had to be filmed again. The whole of the film as it is seen today was shot between July and December in 1924. Flaherty cast village people in the film. 'Moana,' which means 'ocean,' was the name of the lead male character.http://www.tieff.sinica.edu.tw/ch/2001/part3/english-text1.htm The role of 'Moana' was played by a local boy Ta'avale. The film showed the young hero getting a pe'a, a rite of passage, and the traditional Samoan tattoo for males. The pe'a tattoo (the Samoan word pe'a is also the word for a flying fox or fruit bat) took six weeks to complete and the master tattooist (Tufuga ta tatau) was from Asau. A young boy, whose name was also Pe'a, from Faletagaloa village in Safune, played the role of Moana's younger brother. Young Pe'a grew up and became a chief with the title Taule'ale'ausumai. A village girl Fa'agase, from Lefagaoali'i village, played the lead female role and love interest. The film also showed the traditional process of making 'siapo' or tapa, an organic material of bark cloth. The old woman making 'tapa' in the film was Tu'ugaita of the Pa'ia'aua family in Matavai village, where the Mata o le Alelo pool is situated. In the evenings, Flaherty screened movies in the village. These included Der Golem (1915 horror) and Paramount movies Miracle Man and It Pays to Advertise (1919). One time during filming, Flaherty became sick while he was at Tufu, a small village at the west end of Savai'i island. A messenger was sent to the village of Fagamalo to radio help from the capital Apia on Upolu island. From the village of Tufu, Flaherty was carried on a litter to the village of Falealupo, where he was cared for by his wife and two Europeans living there, Newton Rowe and a Catholic missionary, Father Haller. Five days later, a boat with a doctor from Upolu arrived at Falealupo. Flaherty and his wife were taken to Upolu where the filmmaker recovered before returning to Safune. By the time Flaherty and his family departed Safune, they had formed a close kinship bond with the people of the village.

Anderson that produced guitar amplifiers, as well as guitars. Its main product line was the GBX amplifier, which could reach 180 watts with 4x10\\", 4x12\\" or 2x15\\" speakers. The GBX amplifier had a pre-amplifier that could change the gain, brilliance, depth, contour and response of the output. AHED, an acronym for Arc Home Entertainment Diversified, was established in 1969. Anderson's earlier holding company, ARC Sound and its Arc Records subsidiary, became part of AHED in the early 1970s. AHED shortened its formal name to AHED Corporation in 1978, then became Eco Corporation.Western Libraries Business Library In 1979, The Vannelli Brothers were using a GBX amplifier to mix their keyboards.Joe Vannelli article, Keyboards Magazine, 1979. See \\"How are you mixing your keyboards?\\" AHED Music Corporation also had their GBX amplification products endorsed by the popular 70's rock/jazz fusion group Lighthouse. A poster advertising GBX that was distributed in 1973-74 read: \\"LIGHTHOUSE, A super group for many years. Their equipment requirements: versatility, reliability, portability and serviceability - they found all of these in GBX. The equipment that takes over when other amps quit. GBX\\" GBX amplifier The GBX series was a concept created by Guy Beresford, (now with Yorkville Sound) the domed-headed madman who inhabited the basement of Kalua Music on Kingston Road in Scarborough. His family owned the store and he worked at the rental and repair shop in the basement. Legend has it he designed the circuitry based on the idea that the head should be the pre-amp and the cabinet should carry the secondary amp and the power. The idea is you could scale up your power according to need since the cabinets would stack, driven by the four outputs of 0.5 watts from the head. Thus you could have four 140 watt cabinets pushing a total 560 watts. GBX is said to stand for Guy Beresford Experimental. The detailed history behind the GBX guitar amplifier began in 1968 and is in reality the original thought of musician Jim Garrett and engineer Adrian Ball. The objective was to make a solid state amplifier sound like the warm tube sound of Fender and Marshall amplifiers. The secret behind the GBX sound was a coupling transformer separating the front end from the output transistors. Guy Beresford did not get involved until 1971 The guitar series offered different configurations. The Reverb Bug was a 1x12\\" Solid State combo offering 2 channels (Clean, Effect). It featured the same gain and tone controls as the GBX Driver which will be discussed further below. The Celestion logo on the front of the grill meant that this amp featured one 25 watt Celestion G12M speaker, also known as a \\"green back\\", one of the most highly sought after guitar speakers from the late 60's early 70's. These speakers were best known for their use in Marshall 4 X 12 100 watt cabinets. The Super Bug was a 2x12\\" Solid State Amplifier, much like the Reverb Bug but more powerful and heavier to transport. Later on GBX produced the Custom Bug which was a 60 watt solid state combo with 4 x 10\\" speakers. Like the other amplifiers it had two inputs, normal and effects, and gain, brilliance, depth. contour and reverb controls. GBX also built 4x10\\" and 4x12\\" cabinets for guitars with the rear-mounted power amplifiers. The power amplifiers did not have volume or tone controls. They were meant for use with the matching GBX Driver preamp. In cases were the 4 x 12 cabinet had a Celestion logo on the grill the cabs contained Celestion G12M \\"green backs\\". Having the driver separate from the powered speaker cabinet gave the opportunity to add a volume pedal, or mixer pedal, or any other loop effect in between the two. Normally turning up the driver gain would result in decibel levels too high for some situations, but with a volume pedal the high gain tones of the amp could be enjoyed at lower levels. The GBX Driver was a preamp or head that had an effect input, a normal input, a gain control, 3 tone controls labelled brilliance, depth and presence, and a 5 position response dial with dramatic contrasts between the A, B, C, D and E pre-set tone positions. The effect channel produced more overdrive and the normal channel produced cleaner tones. The driver had 4 outputs which made it possible to drive 4 GBX powered speaker enclosures at once. GBX also produced drivers for guitar that in addition to all the usual gain and tone controls had reverb. These were slightly taller to accommodate the reverb tank. Bass series were known as the 'Bass Bug' with a single 15 inch speaker. They also made 4x10\\", 8x10\\" and 2x15\\" enclosures for bass as well as a matching driver. There may have been other series but it's not clear since most of the history has been lost in time. In the back of each cabinet was a power amp which was interchangeable with a unit that ranged from 90 to 140 watts (and probably some lower wattages). The head, a small, black and blue unit with a variety of channels for sounds, a single input and an effect input, was either designated for guitar or bass. It had four outputs on the back which fed the secondary, power amplifiers. It made the cabinets very heavy but the heads, conversely were incredibly light. The GBX line of solid state amplifiers contained quality components which included Hammond transformers, USA made accutronics long reverb tanks and in some cases Celestion speakers. Though they are now somewhat rare, many of these amplifiers are still in use today (2014). The following is a fairly complete list of model numbers found on GBX power amps, combos and drivers: GBX 2153BS Powered Speaker (2 x 15 inch speakers for bass), GBX 4103BS Powered Speaker (4 X 10 inch speakers for bass), GBX 4103GS Powered Speaker (4 X 10 inch speakers for guitar), GBX 4123GS Powered Speaker (4 X 12 inch speakers for guitar), GBX BD1 Bass Driver Preamp, GBX GD1 Guitar Driver Preamp, GBX GD2 Reverb Guitar Driver Preamp, GBX 112GSC Reverb Bug Guitar Combo (1 X 12 inch speaker), GBX Bass Bug Amplifier (1 X 15 inch speaker), GBX Custom Bug Amplifier (60watt) (4 X 10 inch speakers for guitar,) GBX Floor Bass Bass Pedals Note: in the late 70's GBX went into bankruptcy and the company, product lines plans and materials and balance of stock was purchased by Jules Lessard owner of Jules Lessard Musique in Quebec QC. Which had been the local reseller and supporter of the GBX line.A shop was set up in the basement of the store housed in a converted church and the production of the amplifiers and cabinets continued for a few years. During that time some R&D; took place and few changes were made to the product line including a new look. There were also some improvements made to the amplifiers notably the reduction of the operating hum. All the amplifiers, preamps and cabinets were assembled by hand with point to point wiring and thong and groove cabinet construction. Taurus Bass Head Another model designed by AHED was the Taurus Bass amp head. This model had an orange/neon face plate with volume, treble, presence and bass controls. It had two equal impedance inputs and produced 70 watts, enabling it to power external speaker cabinets. The Taurus head came with matching cabinet, although specifics are currently unknown. The head allowed the user to virtually exclude either extreme highs or lows through its controls, and produced its best tone in the low-mids. Darius Guitar Head Another model designed by AHED was the Darius Guitar amp head. This model had a lime/neon green faceplate with volume, tone, tremolo depth, tremolo rate and reverb controls. It had two equal impedance inputs and produced 30 watts to power an external speaker cabinet. The tone \\"breaks up\\" as the volume is increased. The reverb is very \\"wet\\" at maximum setting. These amplifiers used Hammond transformers. Guitars AHED also produced some guitars. An example was the \\"Magenta,\\" which was a hand-made classical guitar featuring a solid top and bone nut. tu57 References Category:Guitar amplifier manufacturers Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Canada Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of Canada ","title":"AHED (company)"},{"id":"8110976","text":"Lalomalava is a village at the southeast end of Savai'i island in Samoa.

The film was created to defend Nader and restore his reputation after his controversial role in the 2000 U.S. presidential election. The film presents interviews with current and former members of Nader's Raiders, including Joan Claybrook and Robert Fellmeth, as well as political commentators such as Phil Donahue, Pat Buchanan, and Eric Alterman. The film takes its name from the George Bernard Shaw quotation, \\"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\\" Summary The first half of the film examines Nader's advocacy for auto safety features, such as federally mandated seat belts and air bags, as well as his rise to national prominence following an invasion of privacy lawsuit against General Motors. It also examines the formation of independent advocacy groups (termed \\"Nader's Raiders\\") during the 1970s; organizations which carried out independent research on various federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration. Over the next thirty years, the film argues, Nader \\"built a legislative record that would be the envy of any modern president.\\" The second half of the film traces Nader's shift to a grassroots form of organizing focused on citizen power, including his disillusionment with the two-party system following the rise of Reaganism. The film examines Nader's effect as a third party candidate on the results of the controversial 2000 presidential election. Response The documentary has an aggregate of 92% (54/59) on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 75% on Metacritic.Rotten Tomatoes page on An Unreasonable ManMetacritic page on An Unreasonable Man Festival screenings *Meaford International Film Festival 2007 *Sundance Film Festival Notes External links An Unreasonable Man site for Independent Lens on PBS  An Unreasonable Man trailer (YouTube) Category:2006 films Category:American films Category:Biographical documentary films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Ralph Nader Category:Works about consumer protection Category:Documentary films about American politicians Category:Films about activists ","title":"An Unreasonable Man"},{"id":"8110984","text":"Prior of Monymusk (later, Commendator of Monymusk) was the head of the property and community of Augustinian canons of Monymusk Priory, Aberdeenshire.

Books, newspapers, radio channels, television channels, movies and music are heavily censored. Clandestine printing is also highly restricted. The special permits that are required to use the Internet are only available to selected Cubans and use of the Internet is limited for the vast majority of Cubans. Mobile phones are quite rare, with most citizens not having been allowed to use them until quite recently. Foreign journalists who can work in the country are selected by the government. Media is operated under the supervision of the Communist Party's Department of Revolutionary Orientation, which \\"develops and coordinates propaganda strategies\\". Laws and government institutions The Cuban Constitution guarantees religious freedom and freedom of conscience (articles 8 and 55), freedom and full dignity of man (article 9), freedom of speech and the press (article 53), and the rights of assembly, demonstration, and association (article 54). However, freedom of speech and the press must be exercised in accordance with the aims of socialist society and none of the freedoms granted to citizens can be exercised against the provisions of the Constitution and laws, nor against the existence and objectives of the socialist state, or against the decision of the Cuban people to build socialism and communism (article 62).\\"Constituci√≥n de la Republica de Cuba (Constitution of the Republic of Cuba)\\" , (English translation) Civilian courts exist at the municipal, provincial, and Supreme Court levels. The constitution recognizes the independence of the judiciary, but the judiciary is directly subordinate to the National Assembly, which can remove or appoint judges at any time and in practice the judiciary is dominated by political considerations. Special tribunals are convened for political (\\"counterrevolutionary\\") and other cases deemed sensitive to \\"state security\\" and held behind closed doors.\\"Cuba\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 2011 Laws related to censorship include: *A provision regarding contempt for authority (desacato) penalizes anyone who \\"threatens, libels or slanders, defames, affronts (injuria) or in any other way insults (ultraje) or offends, with the spoken word or in writing, the dignity or decorum of an authority, public functionary, or his agents or auxiliaries.\\" Penalties are from three months to one year in prison, plus a fine. If the person demonstrates contempt for the President of the Council of the State, the President of the National Assembly of Popular Power, the members of the Council of the State or the Council of Ministers, or the Deputies of the National Assembly of the Popular Power, the penalty is from one to three years in prison. *Anyone who \\"publicly defames, denigrates, or scorns the Republic's institutions, the political, mass, or social organizations of the country, or the heroes or martyrs of the nation\\" is subject to from three months to one year in prison. This sweeping provision potentially outlaws mere expressions of dissatisfaction or disagreement with government policies or practices. *Clandestine printing is a crime against public order and anyone who \\"produces, disseminates, or directs the circulation of publications without indicating the printer or the place where it was printed, or without following the established rules for the identification of the author or origin, or reproduces, stores, or transports\\" such publications, can be sentenced to from three months to one year in prison. The Interior Ministry has principal responsibility for monitoring the Cuban population for signs of dissent. The ministry employs two central offices for this purpose: the General Directorate of Counter-Intelligence, which supervises the Department of State Security, also known as the Political Police, and the General Directorate of Internal Order, which supervises two police units with internal surveillance responsibilities, the National Revolutionary Police and the Technical Department of Investigation (Departamento T√©cnico de Investigaciones, DTI). The Singular Systems of Vigilance and Protection (Sistema Unico de Vigilancia y Protecci√≥n, SUVP) reach across several state institutions, including the Communist Party, the police, the CDRs, the state-controlled labor union, student groups, and members of mass organizations. The government calls on SUVPs to carry out surveillance and to intimidate opposition activists. Rapid Action Brigades (Brigadas de Acci√≥n R√°pida, also referred to as Rapid Response Brigades, or Brigadas de Respuesta R√°pida) are groups of government organized civilians that observe and control dissidents. Migration and housing officials threaten activists with forced exile, the loss of their homes, or by imposing fines. Political fidelity is monitored at workplaces and in schools: academic and labor files (expedientes escolares y laborales) that record actions or statements that may bear on a person's loyalty are maintained for each citizen and an individual's record must be deemed acceptable before they can advance to a new school or position. Cuba had 21 journalists in prison in 2008, placing it second only to the People's Republic of China, according to The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an international NGO.

Cubans cannot receive publications from abroad or from visitors. Before the Communist regime, Havana had 135 cinemas ‚Äì more than New York City or Paris. Today less than 20 remain open, although the city's population has doubled. The Communist regime established a control of Cuba's film industry, and it was made compulsory for all movies to be censored by the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos before broadcast or release. In 1993 a formal structure and system of reporting news not approved by the government was first attempted. This effort for an organized, independent, and uncensored news agency was spearheaded by Cuban human rights activist and then-President of Christian Democratic Movement of Cuba Jesus Permuy. It formally began in May of that year as Members of Civic Democratic Action, an umbrella group of nearly twenty Castro opposition organizations, formed an alliance with the Independent Cuban Journalists Association. The effort, however, ultimately failed. In October 1994, five \\"counterrevolutionaries\\" were convicted of rebellion and sentenced to ten years each. The judges characterized the group's actions as nonviolent, but found they had prepared and distributed calls for changes in the country's social, political, and economic systems, citing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The court characterized the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and denunciations of Cuban human rights violations as counterrevolutionary propaganda. An article published on 19 November 1999 by Maria Elena Rodriguez, a journalist for the Cuba-Verdad Press, described the burning and burying of hundreds of books donated to Cuba by the government of Spain. Unexplained at the time was why all of the books in the Spanish-donated shipment, even those on seemingly non-controversial topics such as children's literature and medical textbooks were destroyed. It was later revealed that some 8,000 pamphlets containing the text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were discovered in the shipment. Rather than risking overlooking any pamphlets that may have been inserted in the pages of even the \\"safe\\" books in the shipment, the Cuban authorities apparently thought the wisest course was to destroy every one of the books sent from Spain.

Some get online through embassies and coffee shops or purchase accounts through the black market. The black market consists of professional or former government officials who have been cleared to have Internet access. These individuals sell or rent their usernames and passwords to citizens who want to have access. Mobile phones Prior to March 2008 mobile phones were banned. However, they could be used by those who needed them as part of their work. In March 2008 Raul Castro lifted the ban on mobile phones along with other consumerist goods. The state-run telecommunications company, ETECSA, says the revenues will be used to fund telecommunications development in Cuba. In February 2009, ETECSA said that its subscriber base had surged by 60% to reach nearly half a million customers. Nearly 8,000 new connections were purchased in the first ten days after the restrictions were lifted. The government also halved the cost of the sign-up fee. The local newspaper, Juventud Rebelde reported that around 480,000 cellular lines are now in use, compared with 300,000 before the change. Between 2009 and 2012 the U.S. secretly created and funded a Twitter-like service for Cubans called ZunZuneo, initially based on mobile phone text message service and later with an internet interface. The service was funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development through its Office of Transition Initiatives, who utilized contractors and front companies in the Cayman Islands, Spain and Ireland. A longer-term objective was to organize \\"smart mobs\\" that might \\"renegotiate the balance of power between the state and society.\\" A database about the subscribers was created, including gender, age, and \\"political tendencies\\". At its peak ZunZuneo had 40,000 Cuban users, but the service closed as financially unsustainable when U.S. funding was stopped. International attention Sanctions, imposed by the European Union in 2003 as a response to a crackdown against dissidents (Black Spring), were lifted in 2008, in spite of a finding by the EU council that \\"the state of human rights had deteriorated\\" since sanctions were initially imposed.

In addition to forming deep gravity wells and coalescing into a single larger black hole, gravitational waves will propagate outwards as the black holes spin past each other. Gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of spacetime, generated by accelerated masses, that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light. They were proposed by Henri Poincar√© in 1905http://www.academie- sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Poincare/Poincare_pdf/Poincare_CR1905.pdf and subsequently predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein on the basis of his general theory of relativity.The Detection of Gravitational Waves using LIGO, B. Barish Gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation, a form of radiant energy similar to electromagnetic radiation. Newton's law of universal gravitation, part of classical mechanics, does not provide for their existence, since that law is predicated on the assumption that physical interactions propagate instantaneously (at infinite speed) showing one of the ways the methods of classical physics are unable to explain phenomena associated with relativity. Gravitational-wave astronomy is a branch of observational astronomy that uses gravitational waves to collect observational data about sources of detectable gravitational waves such as binary star systems composed of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes; and events such as supernovae, and the formation of the early universe shortly after the Big Bang. In 1993, Russell A. Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr. received the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and observation of the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary pulsar, which offered the first indirect evidence of the existence of gravitational waves.Nobel Prize Award (1993) Press Release The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. On 11 February 2016, the LIGO collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves, from a signal detected at 09:50:45 GMT on 14 September 2015 of two black holes with masses of 29 and 36 solar masses merging about 1.3 billion light-years away. During the final fraction of a second of the merger, it released more than 50 times the power of all the stars in the observable universe combined. The signal increased in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz over 10 cycles (5 orbits) as it rose in strength for a period of 0.2 second. The mass of the new merged black hole was 62 solar masses. Energy equivalent to three solar masses was emitted as gravitational waves. The signal was seen by both LIGO detectors in Livingston and Hanford, with a time difference of 7 milliseconds due to the angle between the two detectors and the source. The signal came from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, in the rough direction of (but much farther away than) the Magellanic Clouds. The confidence level of this being an observation of gravitational waves was 99.99994%. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish for their role in the direct detection of gravitational waves. Introduction In Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity is treated as a phenomenon resulting from the curvature of spacetime. This curvature is caused by the presence of mass. Generally, the more mass that is contained within a given volume of space, the greater the curvature of spacetime will be at the boundary of its volume. As objects with mass move around in spacetime, the curvature changes to reflect the changed locations of those objects. In certain circumstances, accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature, which propagate outwards at the speed of light in a wave-like manner. These propagating phenomena are known as gravitational waves. As a gravitational wave passes an observer, that observer will find spacetime distorted by the effects of strain. Distances between objects increase and decrease rhythmically as the wave passes, at a frequency equal to that of the wave. The magnitude of this effect decreases in proportion to the inverse distance from the source. Inspiraling binary neutron stars are predicted to be a powerful source of gravitational waves as they coalesce, due to the very large acceleration of their masses as they orbit close to one another. However, due to the astronomical distances to these sources, the effects when measured on Earth are predicted to be very small, having strains of less than 1 part in 1020. Scientists have demonstrated the existence of these waves with ever more sensitive detectors. The most sensitive detector accomplished the task possessing a sensitivity measurement of about one part in () provided by the LIGO and VIRGO observatories. A space based observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is currently under development by ESA. Linearly polarised gravitational wave Gravitational waves can penetrate regions of space that electromagnetic waves cannot. They allow the observation of the merger of black holes and possibly other exotic objects in the distant Universe. Such systems cannot be observed with more traditional means such as optical telescopes or radio telescopes, and so gravitational wave astronomy gives new insights into the working of the Universe. In particular, gravitational waves could be of interest to cosmologists as they offer a possible way of observing the very early Universe. This is not possible with conventional astronomy, since before recombination the Universe was opaque to electromagnetic radiation. Precise measurements of gravitational waves will also allow scientists to test more thoroughly the general theory of relativity. In principle, gravitational waves could exist at any frequency. However, very low frequency waves would be impossible to detect, and there is no credible source for detectable waves of very high frequency as well. Stephen Hawking and Werner Israel list different frequency bands for gravitational waves that could plausibly be detected, ranging from 10‚àí7 Hz up to 1011 Hz. History cosmic inflation, a faster-than-light expansion just after the Big Bang (2014). The possibility of gravitational waves was discussed in 1893 by Oliver Heaviside using the analogy between the inverse- square law in gravitation and electricity.Heaviside O. A gravitational and electromagnetic analogy,Electromagnetic Theory, 1893, vol.1 455‚Äì466 Appendix B In 1905, Henri Poincar√© proposed gravitational waves, emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light, as being required by the Lorentz transformations(PDF) Membres de l'Acad√©mie des sciences depuis sa cr√©ation : Henri Poincare. Sur la dynamique de l' electron. Note de H. Poincar√©. C.R. T.140 (1905) 1504‚Äì1508. and suggested that, in analogy to an accelerating electrical charge producing electromagnetic waves, accelerated masses in a relativistic field theory of gravity should produce gravitational waves. When Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, he was skeptical of Poincar√©'s idea since the theory implied there were no \\"gravitational dipoles\\". Nonetheless, he still pursued the idea and based on various approximations came to the conclusion there must, in fact, be three types of gravitational waves (dubbed longitudinal‚Äìlongitudinal, transverse‚Äìlongitudinal, and transverse‚Äìtransverse by Hermann Weyl). However, the nature of Einstein's approximations led many (including Einstein himself) to doubt the result. In 1922, Arthur Eddington showed that two of Einstein's types of waves were artifacts of the coordinate system he used, and could be made to propagate at any speed by choosing appropriate coordinates, leading Eddington to jest that they \\"propagate at the speed of thought\\". This also cast doubt on the physicality of the third (transverse‚Äìtransverse) type that Eddington showed always propagate at the speed of light regardless of coordinate system. In 1936, Einstein and Nathan Rosen submitted a paper to Physical Review in which they claimed gravitational waves could not exist in the full general theory of relativity because any such solution of the field equations would have a singularity. The journal sent their manuscript to be reviewed by Howard P. Robertson, who anonymously reported that the singularities in question were simply the harmless coordinate singularities of the employed cylindrical coordinates. Einstein, who was unfamiliar with the concept of peer review, angrily withdrew the manuscript, never to publish in Physical Review again. Nonetheless, his assistant Leopold Infeld, who had been in contact with Robertson, convinced Einstein that the criticism was correct, and the paper was rewritten with the opposite conclusion and published elsewhere. In 1956, Felix Pirani remedied the confusion caused by the use of various coordinate systems by rephrasing the gravitational waves in terms of the manifestly observable Riemann curvature tensor. At the time, Pirani's work was mostly ignored because the community was focused on a different question: whether gravitational waves could transmit energy. This matter was settled by a thought experiment proposed by Richard Feynman during the first \\"GR\\" conference at Chapel Hill in 1957. In short, his argument known as the \\"sticky bead argument\\" notes that if one takes a rod with beads then the effect of a passing gravitational wave would be to move the beads along the rod; friction would then produce heat, implying that the passing wave had done work. Shortly after, Hermann Bondi, a former gravitational wave skeptic, published a detailed version of the \\"sticky bead argument\\". After the Chapel Hill conference, Joseph Weber started designing and building the first gravitational wave detectors now known as Weber bars. In 1969, Weber claimed to have detected the first gravitational waves, and by 1970 he was \\"detecting\\" signals regularly from the Galactic Center; however, the frequency of detection soon raised doubts on the validity of his observations as the implied rate of energy loss of the Milky Way would drain our galaxy of energy on a timescale much shorter than its inferred age. These doubts were strengthened when, by the mid-1970s, repeated experiments from other groups building their own Weber bars across the globe failed to find any signals, and by the late 1970s general consensus was that Weber's results were spurious. In the same period, the first indirect evidence of gravitational waves was discovered. In 1974, Russell Alan Hulse and Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. discovered the first binary pulsar, which earned them the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. Pulsar timing observations over the next decade showed a gradual decay of the orbital period of the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor pulsar that matched the loss of energy and angular momentum in gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity. This indirect detection of gravitational waves motivated further searches, despite Weber's discredited result. Some groups continued to improve Weber's original concept, while others pursued the detection of gravitational waves using laser interferometers. The idea of using a laser interferometer for this seems to have been floated independently by various people, including M. E. Gertsenshtein and V. I. Pustovoit in 1962, and Vladimir B. Braginskiƒ≠ in 1966. The first prototypes were developed in the 1970s by Robert L. Forward and Rainer Weiss.Cho, Adrian (Oct. 3, 2017). \\"Ripples in space: U.S. trio wins physics Nobel for discovery of gravitational waves,\\" Science.

In the decades that followed, ever more sensitive instruments were constructed, culminating in the construction of GEO600, LIGO, and Virgo. After years of producing null results, improved detectors became operational in 2015. LIGO made the first direct detection of gravitational waves on 14 September 2015. It was inferred that the signal, dubbed GW150914, originated from the merger of two black holes with masses M‚äô and M‚äô, resulting in a M‚äô black hole. This suggested that the gravitational wave signal carried the energy of roughly three solar masses, or about 5 x 1047 joules. A year earlier, the BICEP2 claimed that they had detected the imprint of gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background. However, they were later forced to retract this result. In 2017, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Rainer Weiss, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish for their role in the detection of gravitational waves. Effects of passing The effect of a plus- polarized gravitational wave on a ring of particles The effect of a cross- polarized gravitational wave on a ring of particles Gravitational waves are constantly passing Earth; however, even the strongest have a minuscule effect and their sources are generally at a great distance. For example, the waves given off by the cataclysmic final merger of GW150914 reached Earth after travelling over a billion light-years, as a ripple in spacetime that changed the length of a 4 km LIGO arm by a thousandth of the width of a proton, proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width.LIGO press conference 11 February 2016 This tiny effect from even extreme gravitational waves makes them observable on Earth only with the most sophisticated detectors. The effects of a passing gravitational wave, in an extremely exaggerated form, can be visualized by imagining a perfectly flat region of spacetime with a group of motionless test particles lying in a plane, e.g. the surface of a computer screen. As a gravitational wave passes through the particles along a line perpendicular to the plane of the particles, i.e. following the observer's line of vision into the screen, the particles will follow the distortion in spacetime, oscillating in a \\"cruciform\\" manner, as shown in the animations. The area enclosed by the test particles does not change and there is no motion along the direction of propagation. The oscillations depicted in the animation are exaggerated for the purpose of discussion in reality a gravitational wave has a very small amplitude (as formulated in linearized gravity). However, they help illustrate the kind of oscillations associated with gravitational waves as produced by a pair of masses in a circular orbit. In this case the amplitude of the gravitational wave is constant, but its plane of polarization changes or rotates at twice the orbital rate, so the time-varying gravitational wave size, or 'periodic spacetime strain', exhibits a variation as shown in the animation. If the orbit of the masses is elliptical then the gravitational wave's amplitude also varies with time according to Einstein's quadrupole formula. As with other waves, there are a number of characteristics used to describe a gravitational wave: * Amplitude: Usually denoted h, this is the size of the wave the fraction of stretching or squeezing in the animation. The amplitude shown here is roughly h = 0.5 (or 50%). Gravitational waves passing through the Earth are many sextillion times weaker than this h ‚âà 10‚àí20. * Frequency: Usually denoted f, this is the frequency with which the wave oscillates (1 divided by the amount of time between two successive maximum stretches or squeezes) * Wavelength: Usually denoted Œª, this is the distance along the wave between points of maximum stretch or squeeze. * Speed: This is the speed at which a point on the wave (for example, a point of maximum stretch or squeeze) travels. For gravitational waves with small amplitudes, this wave speed is equal to the speed of light (c). The speed, wavelength, and frequency of a gravitational wave are related by the equation c = Œª f, just like the equation for a light wave. For example, the animations shown here oscillate roughly once every two seconds. This would correspond to a frequency of 0.5 Hz, and a wavelength of about 600 000 km, or 47 times the diameter of the Earth. In the above example, it is assumed that the wave is linearly polarized with a \\"plus\\" polarization, written h+. Polarization of a gravitational wave is just like polarization of a light wave except that the polarizations of a gravitational wave are 45 degrees apart, as opposed to 90 degrees. In particular, in a \\"cross\\"-polarized gravitational wave, h√ó, the effect on the test particles would be basically the same, but rotated by 45 degrees, as shown in the second animation. Just as with light polarization, the polarizations of gravitational waves may also be expressed in terms of circularly polarized waves. Gravitational waves are polarized because of the nature of their source. Sources The gravitational wave spectrum with sources and detectors. Credit: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center In general terms, gravitational waves are radiated by objects whose motion involves acceleration and its change, provided that the motion is not perfectly spherically symmetric (like an expanding or contracting sphere) or rotationally symmetric (like a spinning disk or sphere). A simple example of this principle is a spinning dumbbell. If the dumbbell spins around its axis of symmetry, it will not radiate gravitational waves; if it tumbles end over end, as in the case of two planets orbiting each other, it will radiate gravitational waves. The heavier the dumbbell, and the faster it tumbles, the greater is the gravitational radiation it will give off. In an extreme case, such as when the two weights of the dumbbell are massive stars like neutron stars or black holes, orbiting each other quickly, then significant amounts of gravitational radiation would be given off. Some more detailed examples: * Two objects orbiting each other, as a planet would orbit the Sun, will radiate. * A spinning non-axisymmetric planetoid say with a large bump or dimple on the equator will radiate. * A supernova will radiate except in the unlikely event that the explosion is perfectly symmetric. * An isolated non-spinning solid object moving at a constant velocity will not radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of conservation of linear momentum. * A spinning disk will not radiate. This can be regarded as a consequence of the principle of conservation of angular momentum. However, it will show gravitomagnetic effects. * A spherically pulsating spherical star (non-zero monopole moment or mass, but zero quadrupole moment) will not radiate, in agreement with Birkhoff's theorem. More technically, the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment (or the l-th time derivative of the l-th multipole moment) of an isolated system's stress‚Äìenergy tensor must be non- zero in order for it to emit gravitational radiation. This is analogous to the changing dipole moment of charge or current that is necessary for the emission of electromagnetic radiation. Binaries Two stars of dissimilar mass are in circular orbits. Each revolves about their common center of mass (denoted by the small red cross) in a circle with the larger mass having the smaller orbit. Two stars of similar mass in circular orbits about their center of mass Two stars of similar mass in highly elliptical orbits about their center of mass Gravitational waves carry energy away from their sources and, in the case of orbiting bodies, this is associated with an in-spiral or decrease in orbit. Imagine for example a simple system of two masses such as the Earth‚ÄìSun system moving slowly compared to the speed of light in circular orbits. Assume that these two masses orbit each other in a circular orbit in the x‚Äìy plane. To a good approximation, the masses follow simple Keplerian orbits. However, such an orbit represents a changing quadrupole moment. That is, the system will give off gravitational waves. In theory, the loss of energy through gravitational radiation could eventually drop the Earth into the Sun. However, the total energy of the Earth orbiting the Sun (kinetic energy + gravitational potential energy) is about 1.14 joules of which only 200 watts (joules per second) is lost through gravitational radiation, leading to a decay in the orbit by about 1 meters per day or roughly the diameter of a proton. At this rate, it would take the Earth approximately 1 times more than the current age of the Universe to spiral onto the Sun. This estimate overlooks the decrease in r over time, but the radius varies only slowly for most of the time and plunges at later stages, as r(t)=r_0\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{t}{t_\\\\text{coalesce}} \\\\right)^{1/4}, with r_0 the initial radius and t_\\\\text{coalesce} the total time needed to fully coalesce. More generally, the rate of orbital decay can be approximated by :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}r}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = - \\\\frac{64}{5}\\\\, \\\\frac{G^3}{c^5}\\\\, \\\\frac{(m_1m_2)(m_1+m_2)}{r^3}\\\\ , where r is the separation between the bodies, t time, G the gravitational constant, c the speed of light, and m1 and m2 the masses of the bodies. This leads to an expected time to merger of :t= \\\\frac{5}{256}\\\\, \\\\frac{c^5}{G^3}\\\\, \\\\frac{r^4}{(m_1m_2)(m_1+m_2)}. Compact binaries Compact stars like white dwarfs and neutron stars can be constituents of binaries. For example, a pair of solar mass neutron stars in a circular orbit at a separation of 1.89 m (189,000 km) has an orbital period of 1,000 seconds, and an expected lifetime of 1.30 seconds or about 414,000 years. Such a system could be observed by LISA if it were not too far away. A far greater number of white dwarf binaries exist with orbital periods in this range. White dwarf binaries have masses in the order of the Sun, and diameters in the order of the Earth. They cannot get much closer together than 10,000 km before they will merge and explode in a supernova which would also end the emission of gravitational waves. Until then, their gravitational radiation would be comparable to that of a neutron star binary. Artist's impression of merging neutron stars. This event is a source of gravitational waves. When the orbit of a neutron star binary has decayed to 1.89 m (1890 km), its remaining lifetime is about 130,000 seconds or 36 hours. The orbital frequency will vary from 1 orbit per second at the start, to 918 orbits per second when the orbit has shrunk to 20 km at merger. The majority of gravitational radiation emitted will be at twice the orbital frequency. Just before merger, the inspiral could be observed by LIGO if such a binary were close enough. LIGO has only a few minutes to observe this merger out of a total orbital lifetime that may have been billions of years. In August 2017, LIGO and Virgo observed the first binary neutron star inspiral in GW170817, and 70 observatories collaborated to detect the electromagnetic counterpart, a kilonova in the galaxy NGC 4993, 40 megaparsecs away, emitting a short gamma ray burst (GRB 170817A) seconds after the merger, followed by a longer optical transient (AT 2017gfo) powered by r-process nuclei. Advanced LIGO detector should be able to detect such events up to 200 megaparsecs away. Within this range of the order 40 events are expected per year. Black hole binaries Black hole binaries emit gravitational waves during their in- spiral, merger, and ring-down phases. The largest amplitude of emission occurs during the merger phase, which can be modeled with the techniques of numerical relativity. The first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914, came from the merger of two black holes. Supernovae A supernova is a transient astronomical event that occurs during the last stellar evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic destruction is marked by one final titanic explosion. This explosion can happen in one of many ways, but in all of them a significant proportion of the matter in the star is blown away into the surrounding space at extremely high velocities (up to 10% of the speed of light). Unless there is perfect spherical symmetry in these explosions (i.e., unless matter is spewed out evenly in all directions), there will be gravitational radiation from the explosion. This is because gravitational waves are generated by a changing quadrupole moment, which can happen only when there is asymmetrical movement of masses. Since the exact mechanism by which supernovae take place is not fully understood, it is not easy to model the gravitational radiation emitted by them. Spinning neutron stars As noted above, a mass distribution will emit gravitational radiation only when there is spherically asymmetric motion among the masses. A spinning neutron star will generally emit no gravitational radiation because neutron stars are highly dense objects with a strong gravitational field that keeps them almost perfectly spherical. In some cases, however, there might be slight deformities on the surface called \\"mountains\\", which are bumps extending no more than 10 centimeters (4 inches) above the surface, that make the spinning spherically asymmetric. This gives the star a quadrupole moment that changes with time, and it will emit gravitational waves until the deformities are smoothed out. Inflation Many models of the Universe suggest that there was an inflationary epoch in the early history of the Universe when space expanded by a large factor in a very short amount of time. If this expansion was not symmetric in all directions, it may have emitted gravitational radiation detectable today as a gravitational wave background. This background signal is too weak for any currently operational gravitational wave detector to observe, and it is thought it may be decades before such an observation can be made. Properties and behaviour Energy, momentum, and angular momentum Water waves, sound waves, and electromagnetic waves are able to carry energy, momentum, and angular momentum and by doing so they carry those away from the source. Gravitational waves perform the same function. Thus, for example, a binary system loses angular momentum as the two orbiting objects spiral towards each other‚Äîthe angular momentum is radiated away by gravitational waves. The waves can also carry off linear momentum, a possibility that has some interesting implications for astrophysics. After two supermassive black holes coalesce, emission of linear momentum can produce a \\"kick\\" with amplitude as large as 4000 km/s. This is fast enough to eject the coalesced black hole completely from its host galaxy. Even if the kick is too small to eject the black hole completely, it can remove it temporarily from the nucleus of the galaxy, after which it will oscillate about the center, eventually coming to rest. A kicked black hole can also carry a star cluster with it, forming a hyper-compact stellar system. Or it may carry gas, allowing the recoiling black hole to appear temporarily as a \\"naked quasar\\". The quasar SDSS J092712.65+294344.0 is thought to contain a recoiling supermassive black hole. Redshifting Like electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves should exhibit shifting of wavelength due to the relative velocities of the source and observer, but also due to distortions of spacetime, such as cosmic expansion. This is the case even though gravity itself is a cause of distortions of spacetime. Redshifting of gravitational waves is different from redshifting due to gravity. Quantum gravity, wave-particle aspects, and graviton In the framework of quantum field theory, the graviton is the name given to a hypothetical elementary particle speculated to be the force carrier that mediates gravity. However the graviton is not yet proven to exist, and no scientific model yet exists that successfully reconciles general relativity, which describes gravity, and the Standard Model, which describes all other fundamental forces. Attempts, such as quantum gravity, have been made, but are not yet accepted. If such a particle exists, it is expected to be massless (because the gravitational force appears to have unlimited range) and must be a spin-2 boson. It can be shown that any massless spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a massless spin-2 field must couple to (interact with) the stress‚Äìenergy tensor in the same way that the gravitational field does; therefore if a massless spin-2 particle were ever discovered, it would be likely to be the graviton without further distinction from other massless spin-2 particles.For a comparison of the geometric derivation and the (non-geometric) spin-2 field derivation of general relativity, refer to box 18.1 (and also 17.2.5) of Such a discovery would unite quantum theory with gravity. Significance for study of the early universe Due to the weakness of the coupling of gravity to matter, gravitational waves experience very little absorption or scattering, even as they travel over astronomical distances. In particular, gravitational waves are expected to be unaffected by the opacity of the very early universe. In these early phases, space had not yet become \\"transparent\\", so observations based upon light, radio waves, and other electromagnetic radiation that far back into time are limited or unavailable. Therefore, gravitational waves are expected in principle to have the potential to provide a wealth of observational data about the very early universe. Determining direction of travel The difficulty in directly detecting gravitational waves, means it is also difficult for a single detector to identify by itself the direction of a source. Therefore, multiple detectors are used, both to distinguish signals from other \\"noise\\" by confirming the signal is not of earthly origin, and also to determine direction by means of triangulation. This technique uses the fact that the waves travel at the speed of light and will reach different detectors at different times depending on their source direction. Although the differences in arrival time may be just a few milliseconds, this is sufficient to identify the direction of the origin of the wave with considerable precision. Only in the case of GW170814 were three detectors operating at the time of the event, therefore, the direction is precisely defined. The detection by all three instruments led to a very accurate estimate of the position of the source, with a 90% credible region of just 60 deg2, a factor 20 more accurate than before.Update on Gravitational Wave Science from the LIGO-Virgo Scientific Collaborations (Video of the press conference), retrieved 27 September 2017 Gravitational wave astronomy Two-dimensional representation of gravitational waves generated by two neutron stars orbiting each other. During the past century, astronomy has been revolutionized by the use of new methods for observing the universe. Astronomical observations were initially made using visible light. Galileo Galilei pioneered the use of telescopes to enhance these observations. However, visible light is only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and not all objects in the distant universe shine strongly in this particular band. More useful information may be found, for example, in radio wavelengths. Using radio telescopes, astronomers have found pulsars, quasars, and made other unprecedented discoveries of objects not formerly known to scientists. Observations in the microwave band led to the detection of faint imprints of the Big Bang, a discovery Stephen Hawking called the \\"greatest discovery of the century, if not all time\\". Similar advances in observations using gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet light, and infrared light have also brought new insights to astronomy. As each of these regions of the spectrum has opened, new discoveries have been made that could not have been made otherwise. Astronomers hope that the same holds true of gravitational waves. Gravitational waves have two important and unique properties. First, there is no need for any type of matter to be present nearby in order for the waves to be generated by a binary system of uncharged black holes, which would emit no electromagnetic radiation. Second, gravitational waves can pass through any intervening matter without being scattered significantly. Whereas light from distant stars may be blocked out by interstellar dust, for example, gravitational waves will pass through essentially unimpeded. These two features allow gravitational waves to carry information about astronomical phenomena heretofore never observed by humans. The sources of gravitational waves described above are in the low-frequency end of the gravitational-wave spectrum (10‚àí7 to 105 Hz). An astrophysical source at the high-frequency end of the gravitational-wave spectrum (above 105 Hz and probably 1010 Hz) generates relic gravitational waves that are theorized to be faint imprints of the Big Bang like the cosmic microwave background. PACS numbers: 04.30. + x, 04.90. + e At these high frequencies it is potentially possible that the sources may be \\"man made\\" that is, gravitational waves generated and detected in the laboratory.Braginsky, V. B., Rudenko and Valentin, N. Section 7: \\"Generation of gravitational waves in the laboratory\\", Physics Report (Review section of Physics Letters), 46, No. 5. 165‚Äì200, (1978).Li, Fangyu, Baker, R. M L, Jr., and Woods, R. C., \\"Piezoelectric-Crystal-Resonator High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Generation and Synchro-Resonance Detection\\", in the proceedings of Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF-2006), edited by M.S. El-Genk, AIP Conference Proceedings, Melville NY 813: 2006. A supermassive black hole, created from the merger of the black holes at the center of two merging galaxies detected by the Hubble Space Telescope, is theorized to have been ejected from the merger center by gravitational waves. Detection infant universe was found by the BICEP2 radio telescope. The microscopic examination of the focal plane of the BICEP2 detector is shown here. In 2015, however, the BICEP2 findings were confirmed to be the result of cosmic dust. Indirect detection Although the waves from the Earth‚ÄìSun system are minuscule, astronomers can point to other sources for which the radiation should be substantial. One important example is the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary a pair of stars, one of which is a pulsar. The characteristics of their orbit can be deduced from the Doppler shifting of radio signals given off by the pulsar. Each of the stars is about and the size of their orbits is about 1/75 of the Earth‚ÄìSun orbit, just a few times larger than the diameter of our own Sun. The combination of greater masses and smaller separation means that the energy given off by the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary will be far greater than the energy given off by the Earth‚ÄìSun system roughly 1022 times as much. The information about the orbit can be used to predict how much energy (and angular momentum) would be radiated in the form of gravitational waves. As the binary system loses energy, the stars gradually draw closer to each other, and the orbital period decreases. The resulting trajectory of each star is an inspiral, a spiral with decreasing radius. General relativity precisely describes these trajectories; in particular, the energy radiated in gravitational waves determines the rate of decrease in the period, defined as the time interval between successive periastrons (points of closest approach of the two stars). For the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor pulsar, the predicted current change in radius is about 3 mm per orbit, and the change in the 7.75 hr period is about 2 seconds per year. Following a preliminary observation showing an orbital energy loss consistent with gravitational waves, careful timing observations by Taylor and Joel Weisberg dramatically confirmed the predicted period decrease to within 10%. With the improved statistics of more than 30 years of timing data since the pulsar's discovery, the observed change in the orbital period currently matches the prediction from gravitational radiation assumed by general relativity to within 0.2 percent. In 1993, spurred in part by this indirect detection of gravitational waves, the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics to Hulse and Taylor for \\"the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation.\\" The lifetime of this binary system, from the present to merger is estimated to be a few hundred million years. Inspirals are very important sources of gravitational waves. Any time two compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes) are in close orbits, they send out intense gravitational waves. As they spiral closer to each other, these waves become more intense. At some point they should become so intense that direct detection by their effect on objects on Earth or in space is possible. This direct detection is the goal of several large scale experiments.Crashing Black Holes The only difficulty is that most systems like the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary are so far away. The amplitude of waves given off by the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor binary at Earth would be roughly h ‚âà 10‚àí26. There are some sources, however, that astrophysicists expect to find that produce much greater amplitudes of h ‚âà 10‚àí20. At least eight other binary pulsars have been discovered.Binary and Millisecond Pulsars Difficulties Gravitational waves are not easily detectable. When they reach the Earth, they have a small amplitude with strain approximates 10‚àí21, meaning that an extremely sensitive detector is needed, and that other sources of noise can overwhelm the signal. Gravitational waves are expected to have frequencies 10‚àí16 Hz < f < 104 Hz. Ground-based detectors A schematic diagram of a laser interferometer Though the Hulse‚ÄìTaylor observations were very important, they give only indirect evidence for gravitational waves. A more conclusive observation would be a direct measurement of the effect of a passing gravitational wave, which could also provide more information about the system that generated it. Any such direct detection is complicated by the extraordinarily small effect the waves would produce on a detector. The amplitude of a spherical wave will fall off as the inverse of the distance from the source (the 1/R term in the formulas for h above). Thus, even waves from extreme systems like merging binary black holes die out to very small amplitudes by the time they reach the Earth. Astrophysicists expect that some gravitational waves passing the Earth may be as large as h ‚âà 10‚àí20, but generally no bigger. Resonant antennae A simple device theorised to detect the expected wave motion is called a Weber bar a large, solid bar of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This type of instrument was the first type of gravitational wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the bar's resonant frequency and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might be strong enough to be seen without resonant amplification. With this instrument, Joseph Weber claimed to have detected daily signals of gravitational waves. His results, however, were contested in 1974 by physicists Richard Garwin and David Douglass. Modern forms of the Weber bar are still operated, cryogenically cooled, with superconducting quantum interference devices to detect vibration. Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves.For a review of early experiments using Weber bars, see MiniGRAIL is a spherical gravitational wave antenna using this principle. It is based at Leiden University, consisting of an exactingly machined 1,150 kg sphere cryogenically cooled to 20 millikelvins. The spherical configuration allows for equal sensitivity in all directions, and is somewhat experimentally simpler than larger linear devices requiring high vacuum. Events are detected by measuring deformation of the detector sphere. MiniGRAIL is highly sensitive in the 2‚Äì4 kHz range, suitable for detecting gravitational waves from rotating neutron star instabilities or small black hole mergers. There are currently two detectors focused on the higher end of the gravitational wave spectrum (10‚àí7 to 105 Hz): one at University of Birmingham, England, and the other at INFN Genoa, Italy. A third is under development at Chongqing University, China. The Birmingham detector measures changes in the polarization state of a microwave beam circulating in a closed loop about one meter across. Both detectors are expected to be sensitive to periodic spacetime strains of h ~ , given as an amplitude spectral density. The INFN Genoa detector is a resonant antenna consisting of two coupled spherical superconducting harmonic oscillators a few centimeters in diameter. The oscillators are designed to have (when uncoupled) almost equal resonant frequencies. The system is currently expected to have a sensitivity to periodic spacetime strains of h ~ , with an expectation to reach a sensitivity of h ~ . The Chongqing University detector is planned to detect relic high-frequency gravitational waves with the predicted typical parameters ~1011 Hz (100 GHz) and h ~10‚àí30 to 10‚àí32.High Frequency Relic Gravitational Waves . page 12 Interferometers A more sensitive class of detector uses a laser Michelson interferometer to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses. The idea of using laser interferometry for gravitational wave detection was first mentioned by Gerstenstein and Pustovoit 1963 Sov. Phys.‚ÄìJETP 16 433. Weber mentioned it in an unpublished laboratory notebook. Rainer Weiss first described in detail a practical solution with an analysis of realistic limitations to the technique in R. Weiss (1972). \\"Electromagetically Coupled Broadband Gravitational Antenna\\". Quarterly Progress Report, Research Laboratory of Electronics, MIT 105: 54. This allows the masses to be separated by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage is that it is sensitive to a wide range of frequencies (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is LIGO the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana, one at the Hanford site in Richland, Washington and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to India. Each observatory has two light storage arms that are 4 kilometers in length. These are at 90 degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1 m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4 kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive. Even with such long arms, the strongest gravitational waves will only change the distance between the ends of the arms by at most roughly 10‚àí18 m. LIGO should be able to detect gravitational waves as small as h ~ . Upgrades to LIGO and Virgo should increase the sensitivity still further. Another highly sensitive interferometer, KAGRA, is under construction in the Kamiokande mine in Japan. A key point is that a tenfold increase in sensitivity (radius of 'reach') increases the volume of space accessible to the instrument by one thousand times. This increases the rate at which detectable signals might be seen from one per tens of years of observation, to tens per year. Interferometric detectors are limited at high frequencies by shot noise, which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at the output of the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals of low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., Brownian motion) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these 'stationary' (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by seismic noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other 'non-stationary' noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event. All these must be taken into account and excluded by analysis before detection may be considered a true gravitational wave event. Einstein@Home The simplest gravitational waves are those with constant frequency. The waves given off by a spinning, non-axisymmetric neutron star would be approximately monochromatic: a pure tone in acoustics. Unlike signals from supernovae or binary black holes, these signals evolve little in amplitude or frequency over the period it would be observed by ground-based detectors. However, there would be some change in the measured signal, because of Doppler shifting caused by the motion of the Earth. Despite the signals being simple, detection is extremely computationally expensive, because of the long stretches of data that must be analysed. The Einstein@Home project is a distributed computing project similar to SETI@home intended to detect this type of gravitational wave. By taking data from LIGO and GEO, and sending it out in little pieces to thousands of volunteers for parallel analysis on their home computers, Einstein@Home can sift through the data far more quickly than would be possible otherwise. Space-based interferometers Space-based interferometers, such as LISA and DECIGO, are also being developed. LISA's design calls for three test masses forming an equilateral triangle, with lasers from each spacecraft to each other spacecraft forming two independent interferometers. LISA is planned to occupy a solar orbit trailing the Earth, with each arm of the triangle being five million kilometers. This puts the detector in an excellent vacuum far from Earth-based sources of noise, though it will still be susceptible to heat, shot noise, and artifacts caused by cosmic rays and solar wind. Using pulsar timing arrays Pulsars are rapidly rotating stars. A pulsar emits beams of radio waves that, like lighthouse beams, sweep through the sky as the pulsar rotates. The signal from a pulsar can be detected by radio telescopes as a series of regularly spaced pulses, essentially like the ticks of a clock. GWs affect the time it takes the pulses to travel from the pulsar to a telescope on Earth. A pulsar timing array uses millisecond pulsars to seek out perturbations due to GWs in measurements of the time of arrival of pulses to a telescope, in other words, to look for deviations in the clock ticks. To detect GWs, pulsar timing arrays search for a distinct pattern of correlation and anti-correlation between the time of arrival of pulses from several pulsars. Although pulsar pulses travel through space for hundreds or thousands of years to reach us, pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to perturbations in their travel time of much less than a millionth of a second. The principal source of GWs to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive are super-massive black hole binaries, that form from the collision of galaxies. In addition to individual binary systems, pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to a stochastic background of GWs made from the sum of GWs from many galaxy mergers. Other potential signal sources include cosmic strings and the primordial background of GWs from cosmic inflation. Globally there are three active pulsar timing array projects. The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves uses data collected by the Arecibo Radio Telescope and Green Bank Telescope. The Australian Parkes Pulsar Timing Array uses data from the Parkes radio-telescope. The European Pulsar Timing Array uses data from the four largest telescopes in Europe: the Lovell Telescope, the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, the Effelsberg Telescope and the Nancay Radio Telescope. These three groups also collaborate under the title of the International Pulsar Timing Array project. Primordial gravitational wave Primordial gravitational waves are gravitational waves observed in the cosmic microwave background. They were allegedly detected by the BICEP2 instrument, an announcement made on 17 March 2014, which was withdrawn on 30 January 2015 (\\"the signal can be entirely attributed to dust in the Milky Way\\"). LIGO and Virgo observations LIGO measurement of the gravitational waves at the Hanford (left) and Livingston (right) detectors, compared to the theoretical predicted values. On 11 February 2016, the LIGO collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves, from a signal detected at 09:50:45 GMT on 14 September 2015 of two black holes with masses of 29 and 36 solar masses merging about 1.3 billion light-years away. During the final fraction of a second of the merger, it released more than 50 times the power of all the stars in the observable universe combined. The signal increased in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz over 10 cycles (5 orbits) as it rose in strength for a period of 0.2 second. The mass of the new merged black hole was 62 solar masses. Energy equivalent to three solar masses was emitted as gravitational waves. The signal was seen by both LIGO detectors in Livingston and Hanford, with a time difference of 7 milliseconds due to the angle between the two detectors and the source. The signal came from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, in the rough direction of (but much further away than) the Magellanic Clouds. The gravitational waves was observed in the region more than 5 sigma (in other words, 99.9999713348428% chances of showing/getting the same result), the probability of finding enough to have been assessed/considered as the evidence/proof in a experiment of statistical physics. Since then LIGO and Virgo have reported more gravitational wave observations from merging black hole binaries. On 16 October 2017, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced the first ever detection of gravitational waves originating from the coalescence of a binary neutron star system. The observation of the GW170817 transient, which occurred on 17 August 2017, allowed for constraining the masses of the neutron stars involved between 0.86 and 2.26 solar masses. Further analysis allowed a greater restriction of the mass values to the interval 1.17‚Äì1.60 solar masses, with the total system mass measured to be 2.73‚Äì2.78 solar masses. The inclusion of the Virgo detector in the observation effort allowed for an improvement of the localization of the source by a factor of 10. This in turn facilitated the electromagnetic follow- up of the event. In contrast to the case of binary black hole mergers, binary neutron star mergers were expected to yield an electromagnetic counterpart, that is, a light signal associated with the event. A gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, occurring 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave transient. The signal, originating near the galaxy NGC 4993, was associated with the neutron star merger. This was corroborated by the electromagnetic follow-up of the event (AT 2017gfo), involving 70 telescopes and observatories and yielding observations over a large region of the electromagnetic spectrum which further confirmed the neutron star nature of the merged objects and the associated kilonova. In fiction An episode of the Russian science-fiction novel Space Apprentice by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky shows the experiment monitoring the propagation of gravitational waves at the expense of annihilating a chunk of asteroid 15 Eunomia the size of Mount Everest. In Stanislaw Lem's Fiasco, a \\"gravity gun\\" or \\"gracer\\" (gravity amplification by collimated emission of resonance) is used to reshape a collapsar, so that the protagonists can exploit the extreme relativistic effects and make an interstellar journey. In Greg Egan's Diaspora, the analysis of a gravitational wave signal from the inspiral of a nearby binary neutron star reveals that its collision and merger is imminent, implying a large gamma-ray burst is going to impact the Earth. In Liu Cixin's Remembrance of Earth's Past series, gravitational waves are used as an interstellar broadcast signal, which serves as a central plot point in the conflict between civilizations within the galaxy.

Biography Heath was born in 1599 and baptised at St. John's, Peterborough, 16 December 1599. His father was John Heath. He attended Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, receiving a B.A. in 1621, and was made college librarian. In 1622 he was received into the Roman Catholic Church by George Muscott, and, after a short stay at the English College at Douai, entered the Franciscan convent of St. Bonaventure's there in 1625, taking the name of Paul of St. Magdalen. Early in 1643, Heath with much trouble obtained leave to go on the English mission and crossed from Dunkirk to Dover disguised as a sailor. A German gentleman paid for his passage and offered him further money for his journey, but, in the spirit of St. Francis, Heath refused it and preferred to walk from Dover to London, begging his way. On the very night of his arrival, as Heath was resting on a door step, the master of the house gave him into custody as a shoplifter. Some papers found in his cap betrayed his religion and he was taken to the Compter Prison. The next day he was brought before the Lord Mayor, and, on confessing he was a priest, was sent to Newgate. Shortly afterwards he was examined by a Parliamentary committee, and again confessed his priesthood. He was eventually indicted under the 1585 \\"Act against Jesuits, Seminary priests and other such like disobedient persons\\" (27 Eliz. c. 2) for being a priest and present in the realm of Queen Elizabeth. While imprisoned at Tyburn he reconciled in the very cart one of the criminals that were executed with him. He was allowed to hang until he was dead. Henry Heath was among the eighty-five martyrs of England and Wales beatified by Pope John Paul II on 22 November 1987.

The first incident took place for 25 seconds during the sports segment of WGN-TV's 9:00 p.m. news broadcast; the second occurred around two hours later, for about 90 seconds during PBS affiliate WTTW's broadcast of Doctor Who. The hacker made references to Max Headroom's endorsement of Coca-Cola, the TV series Clutch Cargo, WGN anchor Chuck Swirsky; and \\"all the greatest world newspaper nerds\\", a reference to WGN's call letters, which stand for \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\". A corrugated panel swiveled back and forth mimicking Max Headroom's geometric background effect. The video ended with a pair of exposed buttocks being spanked with a flyswatter before normal programming resumed. The culprits were never caught or identified. Signal intrusion WGN-TV Video of the WGN-TV intrusion The first of two broadcast signal intrusions took place during the sports segment of a live broadcast of WGN-TV's The Nine O'Clock News. For 15 seconds, the screen went black, then displayed a person wearing a Max Headroom mask and sunglasses, accompanied by a buzzing sound and swaying in front of a rotating corrugated metal panel that mimicked Max Headroom's geometric background effect. The hijack lasted 28 seconds, and was stopped after engineers at WGN switched the broadcast band of their link to the transmitter atop the John Hancock Center. Following the incident, sports anchor Dan Roan commented, \\"Well, if you're wondering what's happened, so am I\\", and joked that the computer running the news \\"took off and went wild\\". Roan then proceeded to restart his report of the day's Chicago Bears game, which was interrupted by the intrusion. WTTW Video of the WTTW intrusion Later that night, during a broadcast of the Doctor Who serial Horror of Fang Rock on local PBS station WTTW, the signal was again interrupted by video of the Max Headroom impersonator, this time with distorted audio. The masked figure made a reference to WGN sportscaster Chuck Swirsky, whom he called a \\"frickin' liberal\\", held up a can of Pepsi while saying \\"Catch the wave\\" (a slogan from an ad campaign for Coca- Cola featuring the character Max Headroom), and held up a middle finger (inside what appeared to be a hollowed-out dildo). After singing the phrase \\"Your love is fading\\", humming the theme song to the 1959 TV series Clutch Cargo, and saying \\"I still see the X\\" (a reference to the last episode of that show), he said he had \\"made a giant masterpiece for all the Greatest World Newspaper nerds\\" (WGN's call letters stand for \\"World's Greatest Newspaper\\"). He then partially exposed his buttocks, saying \\"they're coming to get me\\", while a female figure spanked him with a flyswatter. After a few moments of static, viewers were returned to the Doctor Who broadcast. The signal takeover lasted 90 seconds. WTTW, which maintained its transmitter atop the Sears Tower, found that its engineers were unable to stop the hijacker due to the fact that there were no engineers on duty at the Sears Tower at the time of the hijacking. According to station spokesman Anders Yocom, technicians monitoring the transmission from WTTW headquarters \\"attempted to take corrective measures, but couldn't\\". \\"By the time our people began looking into what was going on, it was over,\\" he told the Chicago Tribune. WTTW received numerous phone calls from viewers who wondered what had occurred for the duration of the intrusion. WTTW was able to find copies of the hijacker's telecast with the help of Doctor Who fans who had been taping the show. Legal issues An investigating FCC engineer quoted at the time said the perpetrators of the intrusion faced a maximum $100,000 fine, up to a year in prison, or both. Cultural impact Not long after the incident, WMAQ-TV humorously inserted clips of the hijacking into a newscast during Mark Giangreco's sports highlights. \\"A lot of people thought it was real ‚Äì the pirate cutting into our broadcast.

Its name originated after the roses which grew along the banks of the canal.Murray 1997, p. 95. In October 2017 Ian MacLeod Distillers Ltd purchased the site from Scottish Canals and the trademarks from Diageo with the intention of reopening the site.SpiritsBusiness2017 History Records exists, showing that a distillery existed in Falkirk as early as 1798, it was run by the Stark brothers in Laurieston. In 1817, James Robertson opened a distillery nearby named Rosebank - records are unclear as to whether this was in the same location as the later distillery. It remained open only until 1819.Townsend 2000, p. 118. In 1827 John Stark (of the brothers) opened Camelon distillery on the west bank of the canal, he ran this until his death in 1836. After this time the Camelon distillery was run by Thomas Gunn and his father. In 1840 the Gunn's were approached by James Rankine to either buy or lease the Camelon distillery Maltings (on the east bank of the canal) where he set up a new distillery under the Rosebank name. The new Rosebank quickly grew, requiring expansion in 1845 and rebuilding in 1864. Indeed in 1861 when Camelon Distillery went bankrupt, Rankine was able to purchase it as well and demolish it, leaving only the maltings for the use of Rosebank. Rosebank Distillery Ltd was formed in 1894, and in 1914 it was among the companies that amalgamated to form the Scottish Malt Distillers. Later the group became part of DCL.Townsend 2000, p. 119. In 1886, the distillery was visited by Alfred Barnard, who noted that it was set across two sites one on each side of the canal with a swing bridge linking the pair. The malt was produced in the former Camelon maltings on the west side of the canal, then would be transferred over to the distillery on the east side by means of the swing bridge. He also noted that their warehouse at the time had storage for 500,000 gallons (1,892,705.9 litres) Rosebank was once considered one of the premier lowland whiskies but then United Distillers mothballed the distillery in 1993.Townsend 2000, pp. 119-120. The reason given for the mothballing was that its effluent treatment would have required a ¬£2m upgrade in order to comply with European standards of the time, this did not make it commercially viable. At the time of its closure, it still retained many historical features in the production of the whisky. By 1988, the bonded warehouse for the distillery (on the west bank of the canal) had been sold off and redeveloped, partially becoming a Beefeater Pub and Grill. In 2002, the distillery buildings and contents were sold to British Waterways by Diageo, and the maltings were demolished to make way for a housing development.Townsend 2000, p. 120. In 2008 plans were started to open a new distillery in Falkirk original Rosebank equipment. However over Christmas and New Year 2008/2009, the original Rosebank Stills (along with other equipment) were stolen by metal thieves and were not recovered. Plans for the new distillery continued to develop gaining Scottish Government approval, the new building being near the Laurieston site of the original Rosebank distillery. Despite suggestion that the new whisky may be produced under the Rosebank name, Diageo - who owned the Rosebank trademark at the time and continued to release limited bottles of original Rosebank whisky - denied this. In October 2017, Ian Macleod Distillers announced that they had acquired the Rosebank Whisky trademark from Diageo and the site from Scottish Canals in order to re- establish Rosebank Whisky by building a new distillery and re-commencing production in the old style. Rosebank distillery hopes to reopen in autumn 2020 as plans to resurrect the Lowland single malt await council approval. Taste and Reviews Rosebank is similar to other lowland single malts in having a taste associated with fruits, grasses, and particularly flowers,Gill 2009, p. 68. Being casked in oak lends to oak flavourings within the malt as well - the distillery described the nose as \\"light and distinctive\\" and the flavour \\"well balanced\\". The late writer Michael Jackson, described the whisky as ‚ÄúThe finest example of a Lowland malt‚Ä¶‚Äù and considered the closure of the distillery ‚Äú‚Ä¶a grievous loss.‚Äù In his \\"Complete book of Whisky\\", Jim Murray notes that a previous writerBrian Murphy in his World Book of Whisky(1978) could not be taken seriously after making the claim that \\"none of them [Lowland malts] approaches the sunny majesty of the Highland malts...\\" - Murray maintains that Rosebank is the \\"superior Lowlander\\" and should be ranked in the top five of all Scottish malts.

Well known in their day for their underglaze decoration and colorful patterns, Blue Ridge pieces are now popular items with collectors of antique dishware. The underglaze technique made the decorations more durable, and while basic patterns were reused consistently, the fact that each piece was hand-painted means that no two pieces are exactly alike.Betty Newbound, \\"Southern Potteries,\\" Encyclopedia of Appalachia (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 830. Blue Ridge dishware is rooted in a pottery established in Erwin, Tennessee around 1916 at the behest of the Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railroad and chartered as Southern Potteries Incorporated in 1920. During the late 1920s, under the guidance of Charles Foreman, Southern Potteries implemented its underglaze decoration technique, which it began stamping with \\"Blue Ridge Hand Painted Underglaze\\" and similar variations in the following decade. Blue Ridge's free-style decorations helped it stand out against competitors, most of whom used dull, decal-decorated dishes. Although Southern Potteries eventually employed over 1,000 workers and had gained a foothold in major markets across the United States, the company was unable to overcome the onset of plastic dinnerware in the 1950s. The rise of various collectors' organizations in the 1980s helped make Blue Ridge a popular collectible item. History Kiln placer at Southern Potteries, photographed by Lewis Hine in 1933 The Carolina, Clinchfield & Ohio Railroad constructed a railroad line through the mountains of northeast Tennessee in the early 1900s. In an attempt to encourage industry along this line, they sold several acres of land along what is now Ohio Avenue in Erwin to several investors for the establishment of a pottery. The kaolinite and feldspar deposits in the adjacent hills made Erwin an ideal place for the manufacture of ceramics, and the pottery plant was likely in operation by late 1916.William Helton (ed.), Albert Price, \\"Southern Potteries Incorporated,\\" Around Home In Unicoi County (Johnson City, Tenn.: Overmountain Press, 1994), pp. 65-70. The plant initially had seven beehive kilns-- four for glaze and decorator firing, and three for biscuit firing-- and was surrounded by approximately forty houses for company employees. The earliest dishware produced at the Erwin plant consisted of gold-trimmed, decal-decorated dishes stamped under the name \\"Clinchfield Potteries.\\" In April 1920, the pottery was incorporated under the name \\"Southern Potteries, Incorporated.\\" E.J. Owen, an associate of the Minerva, Ohio-based Owen China Company, was named the initial president of Southern Potteries, but, in 1922, the company was purchased by another Owen manager, Charles Foreman. Foreman expanded Southern Potteries in 1923, and within a few years replaced the coal-fired kilns with the newer oil- fired continuous-tunnel kilns, and introduced the underglaze painting technique. Dozens of local women were trained in the freehand painting process.Betty Newbound and Bill Newbound, Southern Potteries Incorporated Blue Ridge Dinnerware (Collector Books, 1984), pp. 6-9. Blue Ridge stamp Southern Potteries initially stamped its dishware pieces with the name \\"Southern Potteries,\\" but in the 1930s had begun to use its now-famous \\"Blue Ridge\\" stamp, referring to the mountains surrounding Erwin. The bright, clear colors and uninhibited style of Blue Ridge dishware gave it an immediate edge over the rigid styles of decal-decorated dishware, and by 1938 Southern Potteries had transitioned entirely to a hand-painting operation. The plant employed 300 workers in 1940 and its dishware was being marketed in showrooms across the country, including storefronts at Chicago's Merchandise Mart and on Fifth Avenue in New York. Blue Ridge dishes were also featured in ads by Sears and Quaker Oats. The outbreak of World War II halted the flow of imported pottery, and U.S. potteries drastically expanded to meet the sudden spike in demand. By the late-1940s, Southern Potteries employed over 1,000 workers and produced 324,000 hand-painted pieces per week, making it the largest hand-painted pottery in the United States. Imports returned in the early 1950s, however, and the rising popularity of plastic dinnerware began to take a toll on Southern Pottery's profits. The plant initially dropped employees' hours to half-time to avoid layoffs, but by 1956 had slashed its workforce to 600. In January 1957, the stockholders of Southern Potteries voted to close the plant and liquidate its assets. The plant was sold to a casket company, and the company's molds were sold to regional potters, most notably the Cash Family's Clinchfield Artware, and to Negatha Peterson, operating as Erwin Pottery. \\"Blueridge Pottery Stories\\" 2010 Erwin National Blueridge Pottery Club Manufacturing process Kiln fireman at Southern Potteries, photographed by Lewis Hine in 1933 The Southern Potteries plant in Erwin covered , and consisted of a moulding department for flatware, a casting department, a finishing department, a stamping department, a decorating shop, and a shipping department. The process of creating Blue Ridge pieces began with the mixing of feldspar, talc, clay, flint, and water in a mixing machine to make a slip. The slip was then pumped into a filter press, creating a press cake. The press cake was remixed and formed into columns in diameter, which was in turn divided into lengths.Newbound and Newbound, pp. 11-14. Some of these lengths were jiggered for flatware, and then sent to the potters for shaping. Others were cast for holloware (e.g. bowls, cups, pitchers), wherein the slip was poured into a plaster of Paris mold for shaping, fired in a pusher kiln, and sent to the finishing department for stamping, decorating, and glazing. Hand painting was usually done freehand. In later years, a faint outline was rubber-stamped onto the piece as a \\"coloring book style\\" guide. The painters usually consisted of a team of three or four who applied the pattern with brushes, sponges or rollers before glazing the ware and subjecting it to a second firing. The final products were shipped in wooden barrels which were made on site by the shipping department. Straw packing was obtained from local farms. The most current pictorial guide to these pieces was published by John and Frances Ruffin in 2012, and includes pictures of some very collectible \\"lunch-time\\" pieces. These are pottery items, usually one-of-a-kind that were produced by employees on a very casual basis. The art quality varies from very basic to quite sophisticated. Collecting Blue Ridge piece with pattern Although the plant closed in 1957, Blue Ridge dishware remained a popular collectors' item throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In the early 1980s, the Blue Ridge Collectors Club was formed in Erwin, and began documenting the 4,000 or so patterns used by Southern Potteries over the years. The pottery plant did not produce open stock, but only made pieces to order. Patterns were numbered and some patterns were exclusive, for example Sears, and Quaker Oats. Pattern names were given to pieces as the newly re-discovered patterns were documented in the two major guide books, Ruffin and Newbound. The plant would gladly accept small orders, perhaps for as few as two dozen pieces. The Erwin Kiwanis club had special plates made for one Christmas dinner. The china pieces, stamped with \\"Blue Ridge Handpainted Underglaze\\" or a similar variation, are the most popular items among Blue Ridge collectors. Pieces with patterns showing people, animals, or farm scenes are also popular (most pieces show floral patterns). After lunch-time pieces, the rarest Blue Ridge pieces are limited edition artist-signed pieces, among them the \\"turkey hen\\" and \\"turkey gobbler\\" platters and the Paul Revere character jug. One of the most well- known Blue Ridge artists was chief designer and Erwin native Lena Watts. Other Southern Potteries artists who are known to have signed Blue Ridge pieces include Mae Garland, Frances Kyker, Ruby Hart, Nelsene Calhoun, Mildred Broyles, Alleene Miller, Louise Guinn, and Mildred Banner.Newbound and Newbound, p. 125.

The role was portrayed by Tonya Williams, on contract beginning in June 1990, until agreeing with the show to drop to recurring status in 2005. She returned to the role in 2007 to 2012. In February, 2011, the character appeared on The Bold and the Beautiful for two episodes, when it was revealed that her cousin is that show's Justin Barber. Storylines Character's background Previously, Olivia was a doctor at Genoa City Memorial Hospital and is a graduate of both the University of Colorado at Boulder and Seton Hall University Medical school. Currently, Olivia is a travelling lecturer for Doctors Without Borders. Prior to being married to Malcolm Winters (Shemar Moore), Olivia was married to Nathan Hastings, Sr. and the two are the parents of Nate Jr. Olivia, an honest and principled woman, is keenly aware of the importance of doing the right thing and lives by the code words \\"duty\\" and \\"responsibility,\\" however, because of this, she is often quick to judge those who do not live by the same morals. She is, though, also known for her compassion, kindness and forgiveness. \\"Liv\\" (as she is known by family and close friends) has always been very close to her aunt, Mamie Johnson. Olivia was a popular and central character. She and her sister, Drucilla (Victoria Rowell), became lead characters, becoming two of the most iconic African American characters for the daytime genre. A setback, however, was that the Barber sisters and the Winters brothers mainly only interacted with each other unless a storyline was business-related.Worlds Without End, p. 107 Under Bill Bell, Olivia was best friends with Ashley Abbott (most prominently portrayed by Eileen Davidson), an adversary of Drucilla's. John F. Smith, however, separated the two as friends in a controversial love triangle involving Ashley's then-husband, Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). This was Olivia's final storyline as a series regular. 1990‚Äì2005 Lillie Belle and Walter Barber had two daughters who were as different as night and day, and bitter rivals. Older sister Olivia could do no wrong. Younger sister Drucilla could do no right. Their mother, Lillie Belle, admitted many years later that Dru was an unwanted child, the result of husband Walter's drunken lust. It was no wonder that Dru ran away as a teenager and spent years on the streets racking up a criminal record. Olivia was shocked by this revelation, needless to say and saw Dru in a new light for the first time in years. Walter assured Olivia that even though Dru's conception was not planned, he loved her regardless and had no regrets over having her. Olivia was relieved and grateful to hear this, but was furious with Lillie Belle for mistreating Dru all those years. Nathan Hastings, detective with the Paul Williams Detective Agency, caught a shoplifter while working security for Fenmore's Department Store, the same Drucilla Barber. Nathan ended up talking the judge into releasing Dru into his custody and took her in once he realized another thing they shared, as Nathan was once illiterate too. Nathan taught Dru to read and be more ladylike, and eventually Dru fell in love with him. But lo and behold, Nathan's girlfriend was Olivia, Drucilla's \\"perfect\\" sister. The sisters were reunited, but it was obvious no love was lost between them. Nathan explained that his heart was with Olivia. Dru plotted to win him away by seducing him, but that didn't work. Olivia informed their parents of Dru's presence in Genoa City. They came to see Dru, but were rebuffed, so returned home. Pushed by Olivia to produce her mystery \\"boyfriend\\", Drucilla talked Jabot executive trainee and Stanford MBA graduate, Neil Winters, into playing the part. Neil ended up falling in love with Olivia himself. Olivia decided that Dru was setting them up, so moved up her wedding date. This was the year of the grand masquerade ball. Olivia had to work, so Nathan dressed as an Arabian and took Dru dressed as \\"The Firebird\\" ballerina. Nathan and Olivia married with Dru as reluctant maid of honor. Dru and Neil commiserated, and ended up falling in love. It was obvious both couples were mismatched. The scholarly Olivia was married to the former criminal Nathan, and the former criminal Dru with the well-educated Neil Winters. Neil supported Dru in her rise to ballerina stardom. But she turned down a chance to tour with the ballet for a modeling career. Neil thought it unforgivable, to be giving up art for self-gratification and big money, so they broke up. A pregnant Olivia was found to have ovarian cancer, but refused to abort the baby to save her life. After the birth, Olivia was to have a hysterectomy, but it and the cancer subject was dropped. Their son, Nathan Hastings, Jr., was delivered early to save Olivia's life. Shortly after Dru and Neil were married at the Chancellor Estate, Lillie Belle left Walter and showed up in Genoa City. She stayed with Olivia and Nathan, and drove a huge wedge between them with her bizarre behavior due to clinical depression. Dru tried to talk Lillie Belle into staying with them in hopes of giving Liv and Nathan space to repair their marriage. But as always, Dru's mother rebuffed her in favor of her chosen daughter Olivia. Walter ended up claiming his wife and returning home with Lillie Belle in tow. Neil's black sheep half- brother Malcolm Winters suddenly showed up in Genoa City, intent on patching up differences with Neil. Neil was convinced that Malcolm was only there to freeload, but Dru got Mal a job at Blade's photo studio which helped convince Neil he was wrong about Mal. One night, Dru over-medicated her cold and ended up being raped by Malcolm, knowing she mistook him for her husband, Neil. Malcolm had secretly been falling for Dru, but never thought she gave him a second look. Dru soon found herself pregnant, and not knowing which Winters brother was the father, considered abortion. But when her doctor told Dru that her former life on the streets had left her with a condition that made it lucky she had conceived, let alone ever would again, she reconsidered. Dru and Mal decided the baby would remain Neil's no matter what, and only they and her sister Olivia would know the rape had ever happened. Meanwhile, Nathan and Olivia were still on the outs since Olivia took her mentally ill mother's side against Nathan. So Nathan began an affair with the beautiful Keesha Monroe. Olivia became suspicious, and both Dru and Neil tried to caution Nathan after they caught him with Keesha. Each time Nathan tried to end the affair, Olivia did something to drive Nathan back to Keesha's arms. Nathan finally ended the affair, and he and Liv began trying for another child. Just as Keesha was falling in love with Malcolm, he found out about the affair with Nathan and dumped her. Then Keesha began getting persistent calls from old boyfriend Stan, who later died of AIDS. Keesha went to Dr. Liv, turned out to be HIV positive, and had to tell Nathan. It was about this time that Dru decided to tell Olivia about Nathan's affair with Keesha. Liv was furious, not only that Nathan had betrayed her, but had also endangered her and Nate with HIV. She kicked Nathan out and forbade him to ever see their son again. All 3 of them were HIV negative, but Keesha was doomed now with AIDS. The compassionate Malcolm began seeing her again, helping her through the difficult times as she grew weaker and thinner, and would have otherwise been left all alone to die. Malcolm cared for her so, he brought her flowers and a veil and married her on her death bed so she could at least die happy. Nathan became desperate to see his son, and ended up kidnapping him. Life on the run was rough on Nate, so Nathan finally did the right thing, and was returning Nate to Olivia when he was struck by a car and killed. After the birth of her baby, Lily, Dru signed a contract and returned to modeling, which took her away from home and infuriated Neil. Neil felt that unless a wife had a meaningful job (such as being a doctor like Liv), her place was in the home. In his loneliness he turned to Liv. Liv agreed with Neil's neanderthal ideas. Meanwhile, thanks mainly to Malcolm's bond with Nate since the death of his father, Malcolm (now a successful photographer) fell in love with Olivia and proposed. Time passed and Dru and Neil split and reunited again and again mostly for the sake of Lily, then thanks to Neil's beliefs conflicting with Dru's dreams, they split for good. Dru finally took off with Lily for the runways of Paris and filed for divorce. Malcolm and Olivia were married, and Nate was thrilled to have the exciting and fun-loving Malcolm as his new \\"daddy.\\" But eventually Liv began spending too much time at the hospital and not enough time on her marriage. Malcolm and Nate's nanny Julia were raising Nate. Olivia suddenly began being suspicious of Malcolm over nothing. When Malcolm's old love, singer Callie Rogers, arrived in town, Liv was convinced they were resuming their romance. Liv obsessed over Malcolm so, she ended up driving him to Callie, who had never stopped loving him. Malcolm tried to patch things up with Liv and convince her she was wrong about him, but Liv suddenly decided she didn't know if she wanted Malcolm or not. Her mind was on Malcolm's brother Neil, the man to which she was always drawn and much more suited. Much to Nate's disappointment, Malcolm asked Liv for a divorce and moved out. Liv made a play for Neil, but Neil was shocked and rebuffed her. So then, of course, Liv wanted Malcolm back and refused to let him go. Malcolm asked Callie to move in with him, Liv accepted the end, and the divorce did happen. Callie kept putting off marriage to Malcolm because, as it turned out, she was secretly married to her mobster manager Trey. When Malcolm was beaten to a pulp by the mobsters for \\"messing with Trey's wife\\", he broke it off with Callie. Of course, Liv found out and accused Malcolm of putting little Nate in jeopardy. Then the always work-obsessive Olivia started getting symptoms she refused to recognize and ended up on her deathbed with aplastic anemia. She further alienated Malcolm when she changed her will so that Neil would raise Nate should she die. Dru returned to Genoa City with Lily in tow and donated necessary bone marrow to save Olivia's life. Olivia's near-death changed her holier-than-thou attitude, but it was short-lived. Then Olivia decided that Mal was not a fit role model for her son, refused to let them see each other, and set her sights on Neil. Malcolm sued for visitation and won. Malcolm was presumed dead from an accident on a photo shoot in Kenya, and since Neil was hitting the bottle heavily, Liv, forbade him to see her son Nate. Liv's best friend Ashley's husband Brad Carlton began playing father figure in Nate's life. Olivia's best friend, Ashley Abbott, faced the biggest crisis of her life: the discovery that she had rapidly spreading breast cancer. She has finished undergoing radiation and chemotherapy treatments and has lost her hair. The stress involved affected her relationship with her husband Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), and Ash drove him into Olivia's arms. Brad was wise enough to stop it at one kiss, but Liv had a hard time forgetting - especially once she uncovered Ashley's secret - that Ashley's daughter, Abby, was fathered by theft of Victor Newman's sperm. Liv and Dru coerced Ashley into telling Brad the truth - or they would. Ash did, Brad was furious and left. Only days later, he and Liv made love. Then Ashley discovered she was pregnant with Brad's child. They have now reunited, and Liv is left out in the cold. Liv turned to her sister's spurned boyfriend, Psychiatrist Wesley Carter, and they became engaged. But somewhere along the line, Wesley disappeared back to Paris, and the engagement was broken. Three years after he was declared dead, Malcolm has shown up in Genoa City, very much alive, sporting cornrows and a bad attitude. Malcolm is out for revenge against the brother whom he thinks stole his fianc√©e and left him for dead in Kenya. Malcolm explained that a family took him in and nursed him back to health, then he ended up having to take care of them. But now mostly he returned to see Nate again. Olivia is resentful that Malcolm didn't make himself known to Nate as soon as possible, sparing him the devastation of his death, and is making Malcolm wait to reveal himself until Nate returns from boarding school at the end of the semester. Until then, Olivia convinced him to stay in her extra bedroom. But both Malcolm and Liv left town before that ever occurred. Olivia moved to Africa and took a position with \\"Doctors Without Borders\\". 2007‚Äì12 In April 2007, Dru was presumed dead when she fell off a cliff at a NVP photo shoot. A prayer vigil was held at Indigo, where memories were shared by family and friends. Olivia remembered what a precocious child Dru had been, and how she had showed her love for Liv when she donated needed bone marrow when Liv was once on her deathbed. Sharon remembered her brutal honesty and her one-of-kind hats. Devon recalled that before Dru came into his life, no one had ever believed in him, and how she forced him through her love to believe in himself. Lily said Dru was the kind of woman who did it all - career and family, and was her role model. Neil believes Dru is still alive and he is not going to give up looking for her, called her loyal and passionate about life. In 2010, Lily went to visit Olivia in New York City while she was lecturing there for Doctors Without Borders, and returned to Genoa City with her. She was surprised to learn that Neil's current flame Karen Taylor was a former patient in New York City. She has then returned and is working at the hospital once again. She began treating Ashley Abbott in her pregnancy, but after some disagreements she has stopped treating her, but they are still good friends. She is now treating and supporting her niece, Lily Winters, during her fight against ovarian cancer. In February 2011, Olivia met with her cousin Justin Barber in Los Angeles, who told her about his wedding plans and invited her to stay for the ceremony. She ended up being one of the guests seeing Justin marrying Donna Logan, the mother of his son Marcus. Liv also had an odd run-in with business man Bill Spencer, who thought he knew her from somewhere else. She also returned to Genoa City that same year for Malcolm's wedding to Sofia Dupre, for the birth of Neil's son with Sofia, Moses Winters, and then again for Neil's wedding to Sofia. Olivia made additional appearances when she accompanied the Winters family, Cane Ashby and Jill Abbott to Provence, France, for Lily's second wedding with Cane.

At the age of 12 he learned to play flute in the Government School band and in 1932 he began playing piccolo and flute in the Accra Orchestra, a schoolchildren's band. The leader of the Accra Orchestra at the time was a teacher, Joe Lamptey, who gathered talented young people together to form a band. Mensah continued to play with this orchestra and also learnt to play the alto-saxophone.

Among the nine founders was Kenneth A. Spencer who would make a fortune from the Jayhawk Plant in Galena. Spencer would be chairman of the Institute from 1954 to 1957, and donated money for the Kenneth A. Spencer Laboratories Building and the Spencer Auditorium at MRIGlobal. MRIGlobal was located initially in the former Westport, Missouri City Hall at 40th Terrace and Pennsylvania. That building was torn down in 1955 at which time MRIGlobal moved into its current Kansas City headquarters, facing the Nelson Art Gallery, and adjacent to University of Missouri - Kansas City and the headquarters of Russell Stovers candy. Rapid expansion MRIGlobal obtained its first contract with NASA in 1961 and its first U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency contract in 1964. In the 1970s, the organization began working for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency developing tests to detect and measure pollutants. Expansion and growth continued in the 1980s. In 1982, a venture group was created to commercialize MRIGlobal‚Äôs inventions. Major projects included engineering lightweight thermoelectric cooling devices for U.S. Army aircraft.

Its main settlement is the village of Stourton, along with the hamlets of Bonham and Gasper. The village is about northwest of the small town of Mere, and is part of the Stourhead estate, which includes much of the west of the parish. The estate is in the ownership of the National Trust, and the entrance to the estate's famous house and garden is through the village.  Geography  The western boundary of the parish is also the boundary with the county of Somerset. To the east of Stourton village lies the steep slopes and downland of White Sheet Hill, a section of which is within the civil parish. The A303 trunk road passes about to the south of the village. Heath Hill Farm, in the west of the parish, is a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. The parish is on the western edge of the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Streams in the parish meet to form the River Stour, which flows south into Dorset. History Several prehistoric sites in the area are scheduled ancient monuments. These include Park Hill Camp (within Stourhead grounds), a small Iron Age hillfort, containing a later Iron Age settlement; Kenwalch's Castle (on the Somerset border), a large Iron Age hillfort; and White Sheet Camp (to the east), another large hillfort, investigated in the 19th century by Sir Richard Colt Hoare. About southwest of Stourton village are Pen Pits, a series of small circular pits where stone was quarried for quern stones, in the Iron Age, Roman and medieval periods. On part of the site stand the later earthwork remains of Castle Orchard, a motte- and-bailey castle, possibly Norman, with a motte diameter of about 55m. The site was first excavated by Augustus Pitt Rivers in 1879‚Äì80. Domesday Book in 1086 recorded a settlement of 28 households at Stortone, and land held by Walter of Douai. Longleat Priory owned land at Stourton in the 13th century. The Stourton family owned land from at least the 12th century, and their wealth was increased by William Stourton (d. 1413), a prominent lawyer, Member of Parliament, and in his last year Speaker of the House of Commons. His son John was elevated to Baron Stourton in 1448. The family were later persecuted as papists and suffered financial penalties, especially William, 11th Baron (c. 1594 ‚Äì 1672). When Edward, 13th Baron succeeded his father in 1685, the estates were \\"greatly impoverished and encumbered\\". He began selling land in 1688, and raised mortgages against Stourton House and manor, which was eventually sold in 1714: most of the ¬£19,400 proceeds were used to discharge the mortgages, leaving only some ¬£775 for Lord Stourton. The purchaser was Sir Thomas Meres, the main mortgage-holder. After his death in 1715, his son John sold the property, which was acquired in 1717 (formalised in 1720) by Henry Hoare, son of the founder of Hoare's Bank.  Stourhead House  Henry Hoare had Stourton House pulled down, and Stourhead House was built nearby between 1721 and 1724 to designs of Colen Campbell. Henry Hoare II designed gardens which were laid out between 1741 and 1780 around an artificial lake. The house was enlarged in 1796‚Äì1800, and in 1840 a tetrastyle portico was added. Most of the building was destroyed in a 1902 fire but it was rebuilt in the same style. Sir Henry Hoare, whose son and heir had been killed in World War I, gave the house and gardens to the National Trust in 1946 and they are now open to the public. The house was recorded as Grade I listed in 1966.  Bonham and Gasper  The manors of Bonham and Gasper (also called Brook) were tithings of Stourton although they were part of Somerset's Norton Ferris Hundred. Boundary revisions in 1895 transferred the Somerset portion of the parish to Wiltshire. Bonham is a family name, the first recorded resident being Sir John de Bonham in 1323. The manor was acquired by Thomas Stourton in 1714 and bought by Henry Hoare in 1785, the Stourton family retaining part of Bonham House and its Catholic chapel. Gasper manor was bought by Sir Richard Colt Hoare in 1799.  20th century  From 1942 to 1946, farmland in the south of the parish was the site of RAF Zeals, a grass runway airfield partly in Zeals parish. The population of the parish slowly declined in the 20th century, reaching 201 at the time of the 2001 census. Services for visitors to the National Trust property provide some employment.  Parish church  St Peter's Church The parish church of St Peter dates in part from the early 14th century, although the earliest known record of a church at Stourton is in 1291. The Stourtons were patrons of the church from the 15th century. After the Hoare family bought the Stourton estate in 1717, Henry Hoare made internal improvements and built a family vault. The architect and mason Nathaniel Ireson was churchwarden in the 1720s and may have done work on the church himself. The antiquarian William Coxe was rector from 1801 to 1811. In 1848 the church was enlarged by building a south aisle, in the same style as the 14th-century north aisle; further restoration took place in 1877 and 1937. The building is in dressed limestone, with 19th-century parapets pierced with triangles and lozenges. The 12th-century cylindrical stone font was transferred from the redundant church at Monkton Deverill. Pevsner writes that the church has an \\"uncommonly large number\\" of monuments. The north chapel has a tomb chest with lying effigies of Edward Stourton, 6th Baron Stourton (died 1535) and his wife. The six bells in the west tower include three from the 17th century. The church was recorded as Grade I listed in 1966. In the churchyard, the chest tomb of Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet and other members of the Hoare family lies under a pinnacled 1819 Gothic canopy designed by John Pinch the Elder. The benefice was united with that of Zeals in 1963, and the Upper Stour benefice was created in 1973 by uniting Bourton (in Dorset) with Zeals and Stourton. Kilmington joined in 1980 and Upper Stour continues today as a united parish covering the four churches. Notable buildings In the west of the village, near the entrance to the Stourhead gardens, stands Bristol High Cross, a limestone market cross with eight statues. It stood at Bristol's central crossroads from 1373, and the upper four statues were added in 1633. The cross was moved to the city's College Green in 1736 but removed in 1762, and given to Henry Hoare who erected it here. Outside the village, Bonham House and cottage are from the 14th century and are Grade II* listed. Lords of Stourton lived here and a Roman Catholic chapel was here from 1559 until 1950. Government The civil parish elects a parish council. The parish is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions, and of the South West Wiltshire parliamentary constituency.

Dugu or Queen Dugu (Áç®Â≠§ÁéãÂêé, personal name unknown) (died 558), posthumously Empress Mingjing (ÊòéÊï¨ÁöáÂêé), was the wife of the Emperor Ming (Yuwen Yu) of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Zhou. She was the oldest daughter of Dugu Xin, a major general under Yuwen Tai, Yuwen Yu's father and paramount general of Western Wei. It is not known when she married Yuwen Yu and became his duchess, although historical texts imply that it was after his becoming the Duke of Ningdu in 548. In 557, after Yuwen Tai's death, his cousin Yuwen Hu, the guardian of his younger brother and Yuwen Tai's heir Yuwen Jue forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue (Emperor Xiaomin), ending Western Wei and starting Northern Zhou. A month later, Duchess Dugu's father Dugu Xin, then the Duke of Wei, was implicated in a plot to kill Yuwen Hu with another high-level official, Zhao Gui (Ë∂ôË≤¥) the Duke of Chu, even though he tried to stop Zhao. Zhao was executed, while Dugu Xin was relieved of his posts and subsequently forced to commit suicide. Later in 557, Emperor Xiaomin himself plotted against Yuwen Hu, and when Yuwen Hu discovered the plot, he deposed and killed Emperor Xiaomin and declared Yuwen Yu Heavenly King. In spring 558, Emperor Ming created Duchess Dugu \\"Heavenly Queen\\". Three months later, she died. (The historian Bo Yang, because her father died at Yuwen Hu's hands, suspected her of having been murdered by Yuwen Hu, but had no solid evidence.)

He held an important command during the 1809 campaign against France, playing a prominent role at the Battle of Aspern-Essling. Early career Von Hiller, born into a military family, served as a cadet in a Saxon regiment and as a lieutenant in the Wurttemberg Dragoons, then becoming a captain in a border regiment in 1774, a regiment he would eventually command. Hiller fought in the Prussian theater during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778‚Äì1779). Distinguishing himself in the Austro-Turkish War (1787‚Äì1792) for his vigor in defending his sector of Croatia, von Hiller was made Lieutenant Colonel in 1788 and was awarded the Knight‚Äôs Cross of the Order of Maria Theresa. During the siege of Berbir, von Hiller again distinguished himself and was promoted to Oberst or full Colonel. He served as general aide to Feldmarschall Ernst Laudon, then returned to command his border regiment. French Revolutionary Wars Promoted General-Major in 1794, von Hiller was assigned to the army in Italy, serving as Quartermaster General to the army in Lombardy. In 1796 von Hiller commanded a brigade in the Army of the Rhine, but ill health compelled him to retire. He returned in 1798, to participate in the campaign against the French in Switzerland. He was wounded in the First Battle of Z√ºrich on 4 June 1799. Promoted Feldmarschal-Leutnant in 1800, he was then posted to the command of the Zagreb (Croatian) military district. Napoleonic Wars He commanded the Tyrol district from 1801 to 1805. He retained command of this district, which did not see major action, during the War of the Third Coalition. Following the peace, von Hiller was made commander of Salzburg and Upper Austria. When war with France broke out in 1809, von Hiller was given command of VI Armee Korps covering the left wing of the main Austrian army. When Emperor Napoleon I of France fell on the Austrian left wing on 20 April at the Battle of Abensberg, Hiller arrived and took command of the V, VI, and II Reserve Armeekorps. Defeated at Abensberg and on 21 April at the Battle of Landshut, he became separated from the main army. On 22 April Archduke Charles was beaten at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl and retreated to the north bank of the Danube. Not realizing he was alone on the south bank, Hiller attacked Marshal of France Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res and won a minor victory in the Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 24 April. Finally realizing the odds against him, he retreated in good order toward Linz from 25 April to 3 May. On the latter date he fought a savage action with Andr√© Mass√©na's corps at the Battle of Ebelsberg. This defeat forced von Hiller to withdraw across the Danube at Mautern. In the Battle of Aspern-Essling, von Hiller commanded the extreme right of the Austrian line. His corps fought well during the desperate two days of fighting in the town of Aspern and contributed materially to the Austrian victory. He resigned his command shortly before the Battle of Wagram. In August 1809 Francis II of Austria appointed him Feldzeugmeister. Following peace with France, von Hiller was made commanding general of Croatia and, in 1811, of Slavonia and Styria. In 1813 he commanded the Italian theater, opposing the army of Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. While von Hiller was not defeated, his cautious operations failed to achieve a decisive victory, and he was replaced by Count Heinrich von Bellegarde. References * Chandler, David.

He claims to have gained ijtihad from the grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei, at the age of 15. He announced his marja'iyya after the death of grand Ayatollah Hossein Borujerdi, at the age of 35. Rohani was one of the first senior clerics to be placed under house arrest under direct order from grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini just a few years after the Iranian revolution. Rohani remains a critic of the Iranian government today. Early life and education Rohani's father, Mahmoud Rohani and Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei Rohani was born to Sayyid Mahmoud Rohani (d. 1961), a renowned teacher in the Islamic seminary of Qom. It is believed that his father, was the person who convinced Sheikh Abd al-Karim al-Haeri to move to the city of Qom and establish the seminary there. His mother was the daughter of Sayyid Ahmed Tabatabei Qomi, a Imam of the Fatima Masumeh Shrine. His brother, Muhammad Rohani (d. 1997), was also a grand Ayatollah.  Education  He started his religious education at the young age of four. He complete his muqadamat (introductory studies) by ten, and moved to Najaf. He studied in Najaf for sixteen years and returned to Qom in 1950. When he entered Qom, he began teaching jurisprudence and principles of jurisprudence in the courtyard of the Masumeh shrine. Some of his prominent teachers include, Sheikh Kadhim al-Shirazi, Sheikh Muhammad-Husayn al-Isfahani, Sheikh Muhammad-Ali al- Kadhimi, Sayyid Abu al-Hasan al-Isfahani and Sayyid al-Khoei. Relationship with al-Khoei al-Milani has been reported to be very close with al-Khoei, and studied under him for fifteen years. Ayatollah Zadeh Milani has said ‚Äúal- Khoei once said to my father Ayatollah al-Milani: I take pride in the Islamic Seminary in which an eleven year old studies alongside the elder students and learned scholars, and with reads makaseb (a compilation by Morteza Ansari that is taught in Islamic seminaries) and understands the contents better than them and further analyses it‚Äù. The eleven year old he refers to is Rohani. Rohani also claims to own a letter written by al-Khoei praising him whilst he was at the age of fifteen. Relationship with the Islamic Republic At first, Rohani, like most other conservative clerics, was with the Islamic Revolution. In fact, in 1975, Rohani stood by Khomeini and condemned the Rastakhiz party, by issuing a fatwa against the party. In 1980, he warned the ruler of Bahrain to govern in conformance with Islamic principles or face popular overthrow, and then later stood with the Iranian backed revolution in Bahrain, lead by Hadi al-Modarresi, stating \\"Iran may claim Bahrain again if Iraq continues claiming the three islands in the Gulf.\\" Rohani was one of the first senior clerics to be placed under house arrest under a direct order from Ayatollah Khomeini just a few years after the Iranian revolution. In the year 1985, Hussein-Ali Montazeri was selected as the Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts, to which Rohani objected and said \\"the supreme religious leader of an Islamic state should not be selected by an assembly of other clerics, but rather chosen by divine powers.\\" Rohani was so angry at the selection of Montazeri that he publicly declared Khomeini's government un-Islamic, armed security forces immediately attacked his house in the middle of the night and he was put under house arrest for 15 years. Rohani's Hajj Mollah Sadegh School in Qom was confiscated by the state after he was put under house arrest in 1995. His home was attacked again in 1995 after he had published a letter to President Rafsanjani in which he openly criticized certain governmental policies. His books and parts of his writing were confiscated and his youngest son, Javad, arrested and later sentenced to three years imprisonment. Furthermore, Rohani was pledged ‚Äúnot to continue as ‚ÄòSource of Emulation‚Äô for his seven million followers and not to have any visitors.‚Äù After the fall of Saddam Hussein, Rohani attempted to relocate to Iraq but has been barred from leaving the country. His brother Muhammad was arrested in 1994 for insisting that the role of the clergy should be a social, not a political one and criticizing the regime for discrediting Islam.See Mirjam K√ºnkler: \\"The Special Courts of the Clergy and the Repression of Dissident Clergy in Iran.\\" https://ssrn.com/abstract=1505542 Muhammad died in 1997. A third brother, Mehdi Rohani, died in Paris in 2000. Rohani claims that Ali Khamenei has repeatedly tried to meet him but he has always refused.

Scalvinoni assumed his new religious name upon his profession as a Capuchin friar. Pope John XXIII beatified him on 12 November 1961. Life Giovanni Scalvinoni was born on 19 March 1844 to Pietro Scalvinoni and Francesca Poli in Niardo (Brescia). He was baptized Giovanni. His father died of pneumonia when Giovanni was three months old in June 1844. He spent his childhood in Berzo.Bolognini, Daniele. \\"Beato Innocenzo da Berzo\\", Santi e Beati, February 28, 2006 As a small child he had great mercy for the poor, giving generously to those who asked, even though his family was in need. From 1855 to 1860 he attended the municipal college in Lovere in the province of Bergamo and he passed with high marks. In 1864 he entered the diocesan seminary of Brescia. He was ordained to the priesthood on 2 June 1867 and held some positions, including that of vice- chancellor of the seminary, but each time he was removed because his innate shyness made in difficult to impose authority. He was assigned as the parochial vicar at the parish of Cevo in Valsaviore. In 1870 he returned to Berzo Inferiore where his duties were to act as a confessor and to direct the local primary school. During the time in the parish he found a need for solitude, prayer and penance. In 1873 he entered the Order of Friars Minor at the Annunciata Convent in the village of Borno. In 1877 he later he made his solemn wows and took the name of \\"Innocenzo of Berzo\\". Except for short assignments of preaching spiritual exercises in some convents in Lombardy, he remained at the Annunicata Convent. There he lived a life of intense abandonment, living the adage of \\"do good and disappear\\". He had a deep devotion to the Blessed Sacrament, finding his sustenance in front of the Tabernacle. He also had a devotion to the crucified Jesus Christ, and encouraged penitents to the exercise of the Way of the Cross. On 3 March 1890 he died in the infirmary of the convent of the Capuchin friars in Bergamo. From 26 to 28 September of the same year his body was transferred to the cemetery of Berzo Inferiore in a trip defined as \\"the last itinerant adventure connected to the earthly world of the little friar from Berzo\\". The mortal remains of Innocenzo from Berzo arrived in Vallecamonica some months after his death. Even though the news went slower than now, a great number of people asked the Conventual house, where his body was resting, to have a relic of his mortal remains. Once the people obtained the permission, on 28 September, nearly seven months after his death, the body was arranged in a coffin and then carried on the shoulders of his Franciscan brethren and was taken to his last resting-place. Beatification Tomb. There are two miracles attributed to the late friar. The first is a cure of a male child at the age of four from an aggressive form of leukemia. The second is the cure of another male child of the age of five from peritonitis. Pope John XXIII presided over the beatification of Innocenzo da Berzo on 12 November 1961 and made him the patron of both Berzo and of children.

Jonas played in the American minor leagues (semi-pro) and the Canadian Football League. He was also the first head coach of the UCF Knights (1979‚Äì1981). Playing career College football Jonas played college football at Penn State University. His first season was 1958, and he did not play (was red-shirted) in 1959. In 1960, as a running back, he ran 49 times for 238 yards (4.9 yard average) and two touchdowns. He also caught six passes, completed 3 of 7 passes, intercepted three opponent passes and returned seven punts. In 1961, he gained 149 yards in 31 attempts (4.8 average) and caught five passes, scoring two touchdowns. He also returned punts and kickoffs. Proving to be a versatile player, he was drafted by the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles in the 13th round (182nd overall) of the 1961 NFL Draft. His time with the Eagles was very short. He played in only one game in the 1962 season. Coincidentally, his Penn State quarterback Peter Liske would also go on to star in the CFL, playing against Jonas and himself winning the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award in 1967. Semi-pro football Jonas turned to minor league football after his brief stint in the NFL; in the 1960s, the days before big player salaries, this was a viable option for a football player. Both semi-pro teams and the CFL offered Jonas playing time and competitive money. *1963 ‚Äì His first season was with the Harrisburg Capitols of the Atlantic Coast Football League. He started as a receiver, catching 20 passes for 422 yards, but when the quarterback was injured, Jonas stepped behind the center, completing 112 of 233 passes for 1649 yards (11 TDs, 14 interceptions) as well as running for another 455 yards. His team had 8 wins, 3 losses and 1 tie, and Jonas was named the league's Most Valauable Player. He also handled kicking duties, as he would for his entire career. *1964 ‚Äì Injuries slowed Jonas down, and he only completed 94 of 204 passes for 1264 yards (13 TDs, 16 interceptions). Harrisburg was 4-10. *1965 ‚Äì Jonas moved to the Newark Bears of the Continental Football League, where another CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award winner, Tom Wilkinson, would play with the Toronto Rifles. Even though his team was 5-9, Jonas had a huge year, hitting 206 of 437 passes for 3268 yards, with 26 TDs and 31 interceptions. *1966 to 1969 ‚Äì The Newark Bears moved to become the Orlando Panthers, and won 12, 11, 10 and 10 games in those seasons with Jonas at quarterback, winning the championship in 1967 and 1968 and losing in the final in 1966. Jonas was the league MVP each season from 1966 to 1968. His biggest year, in 1967, saw him throw 407 passes, hitting 203 of them for 3446 yards and 41 TDs, with 21 picks. His career minor league stats were 1032 completions in 2085 attempts for 17,183 yards and 171 TDs and 130 interceptions, with 4 MVP awards. His only weakness was his somewhat low completion percentage. In 1967, the American Football League‚Äôs Denver Broncos, under Lou Saban, offered him a contract, but Jonas declined the opportunity; Orlando, then paying quite high salaries for a minor league team, also offered Jonas a virtual guarantee of playing time with a winning franchise, something he could not be assured as a backup on the only team in the AFL that up to that point had been a perennial loser. In 1970, the Panthers, financially strapped because of the high salaries they were paying Jonas and other members of the team, were sold to an ownership group unwilling to maintain the pricey talent their predecessors had, and Jonas was fired. At age 30, with no NFL experience, Jonas determined that the Canadian Football League offered him the best opportunity to continue his football career. *1983 - Induction into the American Football Association's Semi Pro Football Hall of Fame 1983 Canadian Football League Jonas‚Äô first season in the Canadian Football League, 1970, was with the Toronto Argonauts, where he was teamed up with Tom Wilkinson. His 124 completions, 256 passes for 2041 yards (and 17 TDs versus 25 ints) did not help the 8-6 team win the Grey Cup as the Argos lost to the eventual Grey Cup champion Montreal Alouettes 16-7 in the divisional semi-final. Moving to the Western Division with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 1971, he hit 253 of 485 passes for a stunning 4036 yards with 27 TDs and 31 interceptions. Jonas won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. He would play two more full seasons for the Bombers before being traded midway through the 1974 season to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for their quarterback, Chuck Ealey. His 12,291 passing yards is fifth best for a franchise that has many great quarterbacks. None of Jonas‚Äô CFL teams, however, would get to the Grey Cup championship with him at the helm. His final CFL totals are 977 completions on 1930 attempts for 15064 yards and 98 TDs versus 130 interceptions. Coaching career Jonas continued on in football as the voluntary, then permanent head coach of the new football program at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, FL. The Knights won six of their eight games in 1979, but only won eight in the next two seasons. At the time Jonas coached, the Knights were in NCAA Division III. Later years Jonas is now semi-retired, working part-time at an auto-glass replacement shop and playing golf. He has done radio broadcasts of Central Florida football games and had a radio sports talk show for three years. He also officiated high-school football games in the Orlando area, and was honored in 2009 for his achievements.

This includes the worlds oceans but also regional seas, territorial waters, rivers and ports. The theoretical concept of maritime security has evolved from a narrow perspective of national naval power projection towards a Buzzword that incorporates many interconnected sub-fields. The definition of the term maritime security varies and while no internationally agreed definition exists, the term has often been used to describe both existing, and new regional and international challenges to the maritime domain. The buzzword character enables international actors to discuss these new challenges without the need to define every potentially contested aspect of it. Some of the practical issues clustered under the term of maritime security include crimes such as piracy, armed robbery at sea, trafficking of people and illicit goods, illegal fishing or marine pollution. Often inter-state rivalry and violence extremism (maritime terrorism) is relevant. This includes the sea being described a central space for maritime security including as a ‚Äústage for geopolitical power projection, interstate warfare or militarized disputes, as a source of specific threats such as piracy, or as a connector between states that enables various phenomena from colonialism to globalization‚Äù. While a concern throughout history for nation States, maritime security has evolved since the early 2000s, when in particular concerns over terrorist attacks on port facilities sparked interest in security in the maritime domain and led to the creation of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Several states and international organisations have since outlined maritime security strategies. It is in particular piracy in Southeast Asia, off the coast of Somalia and in West Africa which has triggered recognition for the detrimental effects of maritime insecurities for economic development, human security as well as the environment. Maritime security is often transnational and goes beyond the maritime domain itself (see liminality). It is characterized as being cross-jurisdictional and/or highly jurisdictional complex.  History of Maritime Security  Historically, the sea has been subject to different concepts of law and power. The term mare nostrum (our sea in Latin) has been coined by the Romans in 30 BC to 117 AD as a term to describe its control of the Mediterranean Sea. From this concept of the sealing of a sea, the legal concept of mare clausum (closed sea in legal Latin) was developed during the Age of discovery between the 15th and 17th century. The sea became a restricted space, organised between Portugal and Spain. Maritime activity was exclusively reserved for the enhancement of national security through naval military. In 1609, Hugo Grotius, a Dutch philosopher and jurist, published the book mare liberum where he introduced the concept of the free sea (mare liberum is translated to free sea in legal Latin). In his book, Grotius laid out the foundation of the freedom of navigation at sea. The sea was seen as international territory, where every nation was free to conduct trade. Grotius‚Äô concept of the free sea was superseded by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). This international agreement first came into effect in 1958 as the Convention on the High Seas (UNCLOS I). The most recent agreement is UNCLOS III, which is active since 1994. It now includes various zones and jurisdictions, including internal, territorial, and archipelagic waters. It further defines the exclusive sovereign waters of a state called contiguous zone, and the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in which a state has the sole exploitation rights of resources like oil and fish. The latter can be extended by the continental shelf, a natural prolongation of the territory of the respective state. Maritime security has until then been mostly concerned with interstate naval conflicts and piracy at sea. The warship USS Cole after an attack in October 2000 while she was being refueled in Aden harbour, Yemen As a concept and agenda maritime security has evolved since the late 1990s and early 2000s. In particular concerns over terrorist attacks on port facilities sparked new security interests in the maritime domain. Notable events influencing the maritime security paradigm are the USS Cole bombing in 2000 and the September 11 attacks in 2001. Several states and international organisations have since outlined maritime seceurity strategies. Many best practices and standards regarding physical maritime security like the ISPS Code from 2002 as a consequence of the attacks have been published by regulating authorities or the maritime industry.International Code for the Security of Ships and of Port Facilities (ISPS Code) In the light of the perceived terrorist threat, the scope of the maritime security concept began to broaden from the narrow focus on interstate military confrontation to include other issues. (See also critical security studies) It is in particular the surge of piracy during the early 2000s in Southeast Asia, off the coast of Somalia and in West Africa which has triggered recognition for the detrimental effects of maritime insecurities. As a result of the economic costs for world trade and the physical threats to seafarers, maritime security gained a significant increase of attention by the shipping industry, insurers and policy makers around the world. Piracy was also the starting point of many International Relations scholars for approaching maritime security as a concept. In the wake of the Mumbai Terrorist attack in November 2008, an Indian scholar even lamented the serious lack of maritime vision in his government's policies to preserve India's expanding interests, thereby coining the catch-phrase \\"sea-blindness\\". Khurana, Gurpreet S. India's Sea-blindness, Indian Defence Review, Vol. 24.1 (January-March 2009) (http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/indias-sea- blindness/0/) One effect of piracy has been the development of regional cooperation initiatives. In Southeast Asia for example, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCaap) has been initiated in 2004 and includes now an Information Sharing Centre (ISC). Besides Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) more topics began to become subject of these cooperation initiatives. The International Maritime Organization Djibouti Code of Conduct (DCoC), adopted in 2009, was originally an agreement on cooperation between East African and Southwest Asian states to counter piracy.Djibouti Code of Conduct (DCoC) , 2009 Since its revision and the complementary Jeddah Amendment to the DCoC of 2017, it now also includes other illicit maritime activities than piracy like human trafficking or illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). Regulatory Environment Maritime Security is facilitated at sea and in ports by several international regulations and codes from the International Maritime Organization. The primary Code is the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code which entered into force in 2004. The United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS) which took place in 1984 gives a framework to piracy prohibition. Since 2008, the United Nations Security Council edited some Resolutions concerning the specific Somali case like for example the 1846th in 2008 and the 1918th in 2010, in order to make member countries put piracy as a penal crime in their domestic legislation. Those Resolutions were ratified, but despite ratification, few countries have applied that resolution in their domestic law. In 2011, NATO put the maritime security issue in its Alliance Maritime Strategy objectives. Despite the few countries who applied UN resolutions focused on Somalia piracy in their national legislation, many have created national agencies or bureaus specialized in maritime Security, like the Maritime Security Agency in Pakistan. The first country to put the problem on their agenda were the United States in 2004 with the Maritime Security Policy. It marked the beginning of United States' Maritime Security Operations, some maritime military actions other than wars, charged to detect and prevent illicit operations.  Practical Issues of Maritime Security   Piracy and Armed Robbery  Armed pirates in the Indian Ocean near Somalia (see engaged pirate vessels). Piracy remains an ongoing issue in maritime security. The ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) Piracy and Armed Robbery report states that attacks against ships and their crews have risen in 2019/2020. They identify that the Gulf of Guinea off West Africa is increasingly dangerous for commercial shipping, accounting for just over 90% of maritime kidnappings worldwide. However, the report noted that the number of ship hijackings in the first half of 2020 was at their lowest level since 1993. In total, IMB‚Äôs Piracy Reporting Centre (PRC) recorded 98 incidents of piracy and armed robbery in the first half of 2020, up from 78 in Q2 2019. The Somali piracy for example has been taking place since the year 2000, after a civil war affected the area. Starting around 2008, large numbers of attacks against merchant ships in the Indian Ocean then led to the privatisation of maritime security as an increasing number of shipping companies hired private maritime security companies to protect their crews, ships and cargoes. This development affects governments, navies and other security agencies because it is a form of privatised security, one of the core functions of modern states. The maritime industry has developed an ISO certification (ISO 28007:2015) for the provision of privately contracted armed security personnel on board ships.  Terrorism  Maritime terrorism is also an issue for maritime security and the definition has been clarified by Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific as to be \\"the undertaking of terrorist acts and activities within the maritime environment, using or against vessels or fixed platforms at sea or in port, or against any one of their passengers or personnel, against coastal facilities or settlements, including tourist resorts, port areas and port towns or cities.\\" The Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation, 1988 defines maritime terrorism as \\"Any attempt or threat to seize control of a ship by force; To damage or destroy a ship or its cargo; To injure or kill a person on board a ship; or To endanger in any way the safe navigation of a ship that moves from the territorial waters\\". Some terrorist attacks against maritime targets are very rare compared to the total number of attacks noted by the Global Terrorism database, however notable cases are famous like the hijacking of the ship Santa Maria in 1961 and the USS Cole bombing in 2000. The September 11 attacks resulted in the global community agreeing on the wider need to improve security in the maritime domain and this led to the creation of the ISPS Code. Since the introduction of the ISPS Code there has not been a major maritime terror attack.Lars H. Bergqvist.  Smuggling and Drug Trafficking  Panamanian ship Gatun following seizure of 20 tons of cocaine by the United States Coast Guard. The Illegal drug trade and trafficking of other prohibited items such as weapons is a key issue that affects global maritime security. In particular, Maritime drug trafficking in Latin America is the primary mean of transportation of illegal drugs produced in this region to global consumer markets, primarily in the form of cocaine from the Andean region of South America.Cocaine: A European Union perspective in the global context (Publication). (2010). Lisbon: EMCDDA‚ÄìEuropol joint publications. doi:10.2810/16059 The smuggling of drugs through the sea is a security problem for all the countries of the Latin American region.United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). (2012). Transnational Organized Crime in Central America and the Caribbean. A Threat Assessment. (September) Drug trafficking organizations have developed various complex systems for the transportation and distribution of illegal drugs, where several countries in the region serve as points of contact for the distribution of illegal products, with an estimated 90% of the cocaine produced in the Andean region transported at some point by sea. Smuggling also includes legally allowed items brought in without declaration to avoid customs charges, such as tobacco. This poses issues for maritime security, as often the smuggling of such items is connected to organised crime. The smuggling of drugs through the sea is a security problem for all the countries of the Latin American region. While traffickers sometimes make use of narco submarines to transport drugs, the primary method of transfer is utilising existing commercial shipping, either hidden on board or placed within legitimate cargoes such as containers. Large ships present organised criminals with the opportunity to transport high volumes of drugs from producing to consuming countries. The volume of illegal drugs being moved in commercial shipping continues to increase and therefore the risk to ships and ports continues to increase, with ships‚Äô crews often unaware that their ship or its cargo are being used as a cover to transport illegal drugs. However, if illegal drugs are found on board by local customs or law enforcement agencies, innocent companies and seafarers may potentially be exposed to huge financial fines or penalties, or even the risk of imprisonment.  Unsafe Mixed Migration At Sea  Issues such as war, political instability, famine and poverty have resulted in many thousands of people travelling by sea to find better conditions of living. This migration poses several potential security concerns for coastal States, including the safety and legal issues arising from Illegal immigration but also the related criminal aspects of exploitation and Human trafficking. Geographic areas principally include the Mediterranean Sea, the Horn of Africa, South east Asia and the Caribbean. Since the beginning of the European migrant crisis in 2015, the effects of unsafe mixed migration on maritime security have been shown by both the number of ships arriving from Africa to the European coast (demonstrating the permeability of Europe's maritime borders) but also by the visible humanitarian consequences of vessels transporting migrants sinking, leading to deaths at sea.  Port Security  Security signage indicating ISPS Code access requirements in the port of Southampton Port security is part of a broader definition concerning maritime security and refers to the defence, law and treaty enforcement, and counterterrorism activities that fall within the port and surrounding maritime area. It includes the protection of the seaports themselves and the protection and inspection of the cargo moving through the ports. Security risks related to ports often focus on either the physical security of the port, or security risks within the maritime supply chain.  Theoretical Approaches to Maritime Security   Realist‚Äô approach to Maritime Security  In the traditional realist school of thought of International Relations, maritime security is mainly regarded as a matter of sea power (also command of the sea). In peacetime, sea power is associated with countries securing the ability to conduct transport and trade via the sea. In wartime, sea power describes the agency of navies to attack other navies or other countries sea transportation means. One more recent definitions in realist‚Äô thinking sees maritime security as ‚ÄúThe protection of a state‚Äôs land and maritime territory, infrastructure, economy, environment and society from certain harmful acts occurring at sea‚Äù. Some scholars then argue that maritime security can be classified into two different types, ‚Äòsoft‚Äô and ‚Äòhard‚Äô security. ‚ÄòHard‚Äô maritime security signifying sea power and domination of the sea and ‚Äòsoft‚Äô maritime security being used for threats concerning ‚Äúocean resources, transportation and trade, and exchange of information‚Äù. A number of constructivist‚Äô scholars have criticised this approach to maritime security where defining what a maritime security issue actually is, often becomes a collection of topics associated with threats in the maritime domain. The US Naval Operations Concept from 2006 for example listed ‚Äúensuring the freedom of navigation, the flow of commerce and the protection of ocean resources, as well as securing the maritime domain from nation-state threats, terrorism, drug trafficking and other forms of transnational crime, piracy, environmental destruction and illegal seaborne immigration‚Äù as the goal of maritime security.  Liberalist‚Äô approach to Maritime Security  Central to the liberal school of thought approach in International Relations to maritime security is the regulation of the maritime domain. Some legal scholars have defined maritime security as a ‚Äústable order of the oceans subject to the rule of law at sea‚Äù. The liberalist‚Äô approach emphasises that international law has been a means to transform the traditional way of countries power projection on the sea through their navies towards a cooperation in order to achieve common goals. The focus of the liberal paradigm has been criticised as being mainly limited to technicalities and formalities of international law, but not helping understanding the governance aspects of maritime security that go beyond legal and normative regulation. However, it has also been pointed out that the liberalist approach is a much better reflection of reality than the highly theoretical constructivist approach, explained in detail below. Dirk Siebels, an expert on maritime security, has explained that regional agreements between governments are generally needed to define maritime security ‚Äì or good order at sea ‚Äì for the respective region. Governments in West Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe or other regions may have different priorities, ‚Äúyet it is their order, defined in negotiations and in line with international law‚Äù.  Constructivist‚Äô approach to Maritime Security  Constructivism is based on the notion, that security is a socially constructed concept. Rather than accepting maritime security as a given list of threats and means, the constructivist school of thought is interested in looking at the relations and how the concept of maritime security comes to be through actions, interactions and perceptions. Constructivists‚Äô look at how different understandings of maritime security are informed by different political interests and normative understandings. Professor Christian Bueger has proposed three frameworks for how to deconstruct concepts of maritime security by various actors: the maritime security matrix that helps conceptualise relations, the securitization framework that looks at claims that are being made in relation to maritime security, and practice theory to analyse what is actually being done in the name of maritime security.  Maritime Security Matrix  The maritime security matrix looks at the semantic relations between maritime security and other maritime concepts (see also semiotics) using four dimensions to relate and situate maritime security topics in and to the general concept of ‚Äòmaritime security‚Äô: * Marine Environment (e.g. connected to marine safety) * Economic Development (e.g. connected to blue economy) * National Security (e.g. connected to seapower) * Human Security (e.g. connected to human trafficking) A matrix may have each concept in a corner of a square, maritime security being situated in the centre. Depending on what is being analysed, concepts like human trafficking can then be situated e.g. between ‚ÄòMaritime Security‚Äô, ‚ÄòHuman Security‚Äô, and ‚ÄòEconomic Development‚Äô.  Securitization Framework  Securitization is a framework of International Relations originally developed by Ole W√¶ver and Barry Buzan. Sometimes called the Copenhagen School, securitization looks at who is making claims (using some form of language) in the name of security to carryout measures that would otherwise not easily be justified and accepted.  Practice Theory  The framework of practice theory enables to analyse what kind of activities are actually conducted in the name of security. Practice in this theory is seen as patterns of doing and saying things that lead to the implementation of maritime security measures. According to Bueger five practices fit within the conventional spectrum of maritime security: * Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA, see also Information Sharing Centre (ISC)) * Activities at sea (e.g. patrols, inspections, exercises) * Law enforcement activities (e.g. arrests, trials and prosecutions) * Coordination activities (e.g. forums, conferences, harmonizing legal frameworks) * Naval diplomacy (e.g. capacity building, warfare) This type of activity might not be associated with maritime security, but rather with war or other related concepts. These activities can be seen through two different perspective. The focus can either be laid on what activities belong to the everyday routine of maritime security actors or on the measures that are done in exceptional circumstances.

The academic study of math anxiety originates as early as the 1950s, where Mary Fides Gough introduced the term mathemaphobia to describe the phobia-like feelings of many towards mathematics. The first math anxiety measurement scale was developed by Richardson and Suinn in 1972. Since this development, several researchers have examined math anxiety in empirical studies. Hembree (1990) conducted a meta- analysis of 151 studies concerning math anxiety. It determined that math anxiety is related to poor math performance on math achievement tests and that math anxiety is related to negative attitudes concerning math. Hembree also suggests that math anxiety is directly connected with math avoidance. Ashcraft (2002) suggests that highly anxious math students will avoid situations in which they have to perform mathematical calculations. Unfortunately, math avoidance results in less competency, exposure and math practice, leaving students more anxious and mathematically unprepared to achieve. In college and university, anxious math students take fewer math courses and tend to feel negative towards math. In fact, Ashcraft found that the correlation between math anxiety and variables such as confidence and motivation are strongly negative. According to Schar, because math anxiety can cause math avoidance, an empirical dilemma arises. For instance, when a highly math-anxious student performs disappointingly on a math question, it could be due to math anxiety, or the lack of competency in math because of math avoidance. Ashcraft determined that by administering a test that becomes increasingly more mathematically challenging, he noticed that even highly math-anxious individuals do well on the first portion of the test measuring performance. However, on the latter and more difficult portion of the test, there was a stronger negative relationship between accuracy and math anxiety. According to the research found at the University of Chicago by Sian Beilock and her group, math anxiety is not simply about being bad at math. After using brain scans, scholars confirmed that the anticipation or the thought of solving math actually causes math anxiety. The brain scans showed that the area of the brain that is triggered when someone has math anxiety overlaps the same area of the brain where bodily harm is registered.Harms, William. \\"When People Worry about Math, the Brain Feels the Pain.\\" UChicago News. The University of Chicago, 31 Oct. 2012. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. And Trezise and Reeve show that students' math anxiety can fluctuate throughout the duration of a math class. Performance The impact of mathematics anxiety on mathematics performance has been studied in much recent literature. An individual with math anxiety does not necessarily lack ability in mathematics, rather, they cannot perform to their full potential due to the interfering symptoms of their anxiety. Math anxiety manifests itself in a variety of ways, including physical, psychological, and behavioral symptoms, that can all disrupt a student's mathematical performance. The strong negative correlation between high math anxiety and low achievement is often thought to be due to the impact of math anxiety on working memory. Working memory has a limited capacity, and when solving mathematical problems, a large portion of this capacity is dedicated to problem solving. However, in individuals with math anxiety, much of this space is taken up by anxious thoughts, thus compromising the individual's ability to perform. In addition, a frequent reliance in schools on high-stakes and timed testing, where students tend to feel the most anxiety, can lead to lower achievement for math anxious individuals. Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results demonstrate that students experiencing high math anxiety demonstrate mathematics scores that are 34 points lower than students who do not have math anxiety, equivalent to one full year of school. These findings demonstrate the clear link between math anxiety and reduced levels of achievement, suggesting that alleviating math anxiety may lead to a marked improvement in student achievement. Anxiety rating scale A rating scale for mathematics anxiety was written about in 1972 by Richardson and Suinn. Richardson and Suinn defined mathematical anxiety as \\"feelings of apprehension and tension concerning manipulation of numbers and completion of mathematical problems in various contexts\\". Richardson and Suinn introduced the MARS (Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale) in 1972. Elevated scores on the MARS test translate to high math anxiety. The authors presented the normative data, including a mean score of 215.38 with a standard deviation of 65.29, collected from 397 students that replied to an advertisement for behavior therapy treatment for math anxiety. For test-retest reliability, the Pearson product-moment coefficient was used and a score of 0.85 was calculated, which was favorable and comparable to scores found on other anxiety tests. Richardson and Suinn validated the construct of this test by sharing previous results from three other studies that were very similar to the results achieved in this study. They also administered the Differential Aptitude Test, a 10-minute math test including simple to complex problems. Calculation of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the MARS test and Differential Aptitude Test scores was ‚àí0.64 (p < .01), indicating that higher MARS scores relate to lower math test scores and \\"since high anxiety interferes with performance, and poor performance produces anxiety, this result provides evidence that the MARS does measure mathematics anxiety\\". This test was intended for use in diagnosing math anxiety, testing efficacy of different math anxiety treatment approaches and possibly designing an anxiety hierarchy to be used in desensitization treatments. The MARS test is of interest to those in counseling psychology and the test is used profusely in math anxiety research. It is available in several versions of varying length and is considered psychometrically sound.Alexander, L., & Cobb, R. (1984). Identification of the dimensions and predictors of math anxiety among college students. Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Mid-South Educational Research Association (New Orleans, LA, November 16, 1984). ERIC, ED 251320. Other tests are often given to measure different dimensionalities of math anxiety, such as Elizabeth Fennema and Julia Sherman's Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitudes Scales (FSMAS). The FSMAS evaluates nine specific domains using Likert-type scales: attitude toward success, mathematics as a male domain, mother's attitude, father's attitude, teacher's attitude, confidence in learning mathematics, mathematics anxiety, affectance motivation and mathematics usefulness. Despite the introduction of newer instrumentation, the use of the MARS test appears to be the educational standard for measuring math anxiety due to its specificity and prolific use. Math and culture While there are overarching similarities concerning the acquisition of math skills, researchers have shown that children's mathematical abilities differ across countries. In Canada, students score substantially lower in math problem-solving and operations than students in Korea, India and Singapore. Researchers have conducted thorough comparisons between countries, and have determined that in countries such as Taiwan and Japan, parents place more emphasis on effort rather than one's innate intellectual ability in school success. By parents placing a higher emphasis on effort rather than one's innate intellectual ability they are helping their child develop a growth mindset.Dweck, C. S. (2006). Mindset: The new psychology of success.New York: Random House. People who develop a growth mindset believe that everyone has the ability to grow their intellectual ability, learn from their mistakes and become more resilient learners. Moreover, parents in these countries tend to set higher expectations and standards for their children. In turn, students spend more time on homework and value homework more than American children. Math and gender Another difference in mathematic abilities often explored in research concerns gender disparities. There has been research examining gender difference in performance on standardized tests across various countries. Beller and Gafni's have shown that children at approximately nine years of age do not show consistent gender difference in relation to math skills. However, in 17 out of the 20 countries examined in this study, 13-year-old boys tended to score higher than girls. Moreover, mathematics is often labeled as a masculine ability; as a result, girls often have low confidence in their math capabilities.. These gender stereotypes can reinforce low confidence in girls and can cause math anxiety as research has shown that performance on standardized math tests is affected by one's confidence. As a result, educators have been trying to abolish this stereotype by fostering confidence in math in all students in order to avoid math anxiety.Kail, R.V., & Zolner, T. (2005). Children. Toronto: Prentice Hall. Math pedagogy The principles of mathematics are generally understood at an early age; preschoolers can comprehend the majority of principles underlying counting. By kindergarten, it is common for children to use counting in a more sophisticated manner by adding and subtracting numbers. While kindergarteners tend to use their fingers to count, this habit is soon abandoned and replaced with a more refined and efficient strategy; children begin to perform addition and subtraction mentally at approximately six years of age. When children reach approximately eight years of age, they can retrieve answers to mathematical equations from memory. With proper instruction, normally functioning children acquire these basic mathematical skills and are able to solve more complex mathematical problems with more sophisticated training. (Kail & Zolner, 2005). High risk teaching styles are often explored to gain a better understanding of math anxiety. Goulding, Rowland, and BarberGoulding, M., Rowland, T., Barber, T. (2002). Does it matter? Primary teachers trainees' subject knowledge in mathematics. British Educational Research Journal, 28, 689-704. (2002) suggest that there are linkages between a teacher's lack of subject knowledge and ability to plan teaching material effectively. These findings suggest that teachers that do not have a sufficient background in mathematics may struggle with the development of comprehensive lesson plans for their students. Similarly, Laturner's research (2002) shows that teachers with certification in math are more likely to be passionate and committed about teaching math than those without certification. However, those without certification vary in their commitment to the profession depending on coursework preparation. Moreover, a study conducted by Kawakami, Steele, Cifa, Phills, and Dovidio (2008) examined attitudes towards math and behavior during math examinations. The study examined the effect of extensive training in teaching women to approach math. The results showed that women who were trained to approach rather than avoid math showed a positive implicit attitude towards math. These findings were only consistent with women low in initial identification with math. This study was replicated with women who were either encouraged to approach math or who received neutral training. Results were consistent and demonstrated that women taught to approach math had an implicit positive attitude and completed more math problems than women taught to approach math in a neutral manner. Johns, Schmader, and Martens (2005) conducted a study in which they examined the effect of teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance. The researchers concluded that women tended to perform worse than men when problems were described as math equations. However, women did not differ from men when the test sequence was described as problem solving or in a condition in which they learned about stereotype threats. This research has practical implications. The results suggested that teaching students about stereotype threat could offer a practical means of reducing its detrimental effects and lead to an improvement in a girl's performance and mathematical ability. Concluding that educating female teachers about stereotype threat can reduce its negative effects in the classroom. Common beliefs A view associated with Francis Galton author of Hereditary Genius (1869) suggests that \\"when asked to explain why some children do better in math than others, Asian children, their teachers, and their parents point to hard work, their American counterparts to ability.\\"Tobias, Sheila, Overcoming Math Anxiety. (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1993), page 52 According to Margaret Murray, female mathematicians in the United States have almost always been a minority. Although the exact difference fluctuates with the times, as she has explored in her book Women Becoming Mathematicians: Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America, \\"Since 1980, women have earned over 17 percent of the mathematics doctorates.... [In The United States]\\". The trends in gender are by no means clear, but perhaps parity is still a way to go. Since 1995, studies have shown that the gender gap favored males in most mathematical standardized testing with boys outperforming girls in 15 out of 28 countries. However, as of 2015 the gender gap has almost been reversed, showing an increase in female presence. This being caused by women steadily increasing their performance on math and science testing and enrollment, but also from males losing ground at the same time. This role reversal can largely be associated with the gender normative stereotypes that are found in the Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) field, deeming \\"who math is for\\" and \\"who STEM careers are for\\". These stereotypes can fuel mathematical anxiety that is already present among young female populations. Thus parity will take more work to overcome mathematical anxiety and this is one reason for women in mathematics being role models for younger women.  In schools Causes Students often develop mathematical anxiety in schools, often as a result of learning from teachers who are themselves anxious about their mathematical abilities in certain areas. Typical examples of areas where mathematics teachers are often incompetent or semi-competent include fractions, (long) division, algebra, geometry \\"with proofs\\", calculus, and topology. In many countries, would-be math teachers are required only to obtain passing grades of 51% in mathematics exams, so that a math student who has failed to understand 49% of the math syllabus throughout his or her education can, and often does, become a math teacher. His or her fears and lack of understanding then pass naturally to his or her students. According to John Taylor Gatto, as expounded in several lengthy books, modern Western schools were deliberately designed during the late 19th century to create an environment which is ideal for fostering fear and anxiety, and for preventing or delaying learning. Many who are sympathetic to Gatto's thesis regard his position as unnecessarily extreme. Diane Ravitch, former assistant secretary of education during the George H.W. Bush administration, agrees with Gatto up to a point, conceding that there is an element of social engineering (i.e. manufacture of compliant citizenry) in the construction of the American education system, which prioritizes conformance over learning. The role of attachment has been suggested as having an impact in the development of the anxiety. Children with an insecure attachment style were more likely to demonstrate the anxiety. Math is usually taught as a right and wrong subject and as if getting the right answer were paramount. In contrast to most subjects, mathematics problems almost always have a right answer. Additionally, the subject is often taught as if there were a right way to solve the problem and any other approaches would be wrong, even if students got the right answer. When learning, understanding the concepts should be paramount, but with a right/wrong approach to teaching math, students are encouraged not to try, not to experiment, not to find algorithms that work for them, and not to take risks. \\"Teachers benefit children most when they encourage them to share their thinking process and justify their answers out loud or in writing as they perform math operations. ... With less of an emphasis on right or wrong and more of an emphasis on process, teachers can help alleviate students' anxiety about math\\".Furner, Joseph M., Berman, Barbara T., \\"Math anxiety: Overcoming a major obstacle to the improvement of student math performance\\", Childhood Education, Spring 2003 While teaching of many subjects has changed from rote memorization to the current Constructivist approach, math is frequently taught with a rote learning behaviorist approach. That is, * A problem set is introduced * A solution technique is introduced * Practice problems are repeated until mastery is achieved Constructivist theory says the learning and knowledge is the student's creation, yet rote learning and a right/wrong approach to teaching math ensures that it is external to the student. Solutions There have been many studies that show parent involvement in developing a child's educational processes is essential. A student's success in school is increased if their parents are involved in their education both at home and school (Henderson & Map, 2002).Henderson, A. T. & Mapp, K. L. (2002), A New Wave of Evidence. The Impact of School,Family, and Community Connections on Student Achievement, Austin: Southwest Educational Development Laboratory As a result, one of the easiest ways to reduce math anxiety is for the parent to be more involved in their child's education. In addition, research has shown that a parent's perception on mathematics influences their child's perception and achievement in mathematics (Yee & Eccles, 1988).Yee DK, Eccles JS. 1988. Parent perceptions and attributions for children's math achievement. Sex Roles 19:317‚Äì33. This means that if a parent makes it apparent that they do not enjoy mathematics or that they are not good at mathematics, this can influence the way in which their child views mathematics. Furthermore, studies by Herbert P. Ginsburg, Columbia University, show the influence of parents' and teachers' attitudes on \\"'the child's expectations in that area of learning.'... It is less the actual teaching and more the attitude and expectations of the teacher or parents that count\\". This is further supported by a survey of Montgomery County, Maryland students who \\"pointed to their parents as the primary force behind the interest in mathematics\\".Zaslavsky, Claudia, Fear of Math, pages 198-199. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1994) Claudia Zaslavsky contends that math has two components. The first component, commonly focused on in many schools, is to calculate the answer. This component also has two subcomponents, namely the answer and the process or method used to determine the answer. Focusing more on the process or method enables students to make mistakes, but not 'fail at math'. The second component is to understand the mathematical concepts that underlay the problem being studied. \\"... and in this respect studying mathematics is much more like studying, say, music or painting than it is like studying history or biology.\\" Amongst others supporting this viewpoint is the work of Dr. Eugene Geist, Associate Professor at Ohio University ‚Äì Athens, Ohio and an early childhood education specialist.\\"Episode 54: Math Anxiety ‚Äì Causes and Cures\\", by Michael on April 13, 2008, http://www.thepsychfiles.com/2008/04/episode-54-math-anxiety-causes- and-cures/ September 7, 2009 Dr. Geist's recommendations include focusing on the concepts rather than the right answer and letting students work on their own and discuss their solutions before the answer is given. Emphasis is given that young people hate to be wrong and hate situations where they can be embarrassed by being wrong. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (1989, 1995b) suggestions for teachers seeking to prevent math anxiety include: > * Accommodating for different learning styles * Creating a variety of > testing environments * Designing positive experiences in math classes * > Refraining from tying self-esteem to success with math * Emphasizing that > everyone makes mistakes in mathematics * Making math relevant * Letting > students have some input into their own evaluations * Allowing for different > social approaches to learning mathematics * Emphasizing the importance of > original, quality thinking rather than rote manipulation of formulas Hackworth (1992)Hackworth, R. D. (1992). Math anxiety reduction. Clearwater, FL: H & H. suggests that the following activities can help in reducing and mitigating mathematical anxiety: > * Discuss and write about math feelings; * Become acquainted with good math > instruction, as well as study techniques; * Recognize what type of > information needs to be learned; * Be an active learner, and create problem- > solving techniques; * Evaluate your own learning; * Develop calming/positive > ways to deal with fear of math, including visualization, positive messages, > relaxation techniques, frustration breaks; * Use gradual, repeated success > to build math confidence in students Math (and Statistics) Therapy is a combination of coaching and counseling, provided for adults by people with credentials in both counseling and math education. In Math Therapy the reasons for anxiety are addressed, as well as the mathematical skills which are lacking. New coping skills are introduced and practiced, so that fear, distaste or other negative emotions do not block math (or statistics) learning. There are several anxiety reducing techniques that teachers can teach their children and practice periodically throughout the year. Teachers will need to learn these techniques and encourage the students to practice them at home and to use them prior to testing or when feeling anxious during math class. Several studies have shown that relaxation techniques can be used to help alleviate anxiety related to mathematics. In her workbook Conquering Math Anxiety, Cynthia Arem offers specific strategies to reduce math avoidance and anxiety. One strategy she advocates for is relaxation exercises and indicates that by practicing relaxation techniques on a regular basis for 10‚Äì20 minutes students can significantly reduce their anxiety. Dr. Edmundo Jacobson's Progressive Muscle Relaxation taken from the book Mental Toughness Training for Sports, Loehr (1986) can be used in a modified form to reduce anxiety as posted on the website HypnoGenesis. Visualization has also been used effectively to help reduce math anxiety. Arem has a chapter that deals with reducing test anxiety and advocates the use of visualization. In her chapter titled Conquer Test Anxiety (Chapter 9) she has specific exercises devoted to visualization techniques to help the student feel calm and confident during testing. Studies have shown students learn best when they are active rather than passive learners.Spikell, M .Teaching Mathematics With Manipulatives: A Resource of Activities for K-12 Teacher. (New York: Allyn and Bacon, 1993) The theory of multiple intelligences suggests that there is a need for addressing different learning styles. Math lessons can be tailored for visual/spatial, logical/mathematics, musical, auditory, body/kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal and verbal/linguistic learning styles. This theory of learning styles has never been demonstrated to be true in controlled trials. Studies show no evidence to support tailoring lessons to an individual students learning style to be beneficial. New concepts can be taught through play acting, cooperative groups, visual aids, hands on activities or information technology.Curtain- Phillips, M. Math Attack: How to Reduce Math Anxiety in the Classroom, at Work and in Everyday Personal Use. (Atlanta: Curtain-Phillips Publishing, 1999) To help with learning statistics, there are many applets found on the Internet that help students learn about many things from probability distributions to linear regression. These applets are commonly used in introductory statistics classes, as many students benefit from using them. Active learners ask critical questions, such as: Why do we do it this way, and not that way? Some teachers may find these questions annoying or difficult to answer, and indeed may have been trained to respond to such questions with hostility and contempt, designed to instill fear. Better teachers respond eagerly to these questions, and use them to help the students deepen their understanding by examining alternative methods so the students can choose for themselves which method they prefer. This process can result in meaningful class discussions. Talking is the way in which students increase their understanding and command of math. Teachers can emphasize the importance of original thinking rather than rote manipulation of formulas. This can be done through class conversations. Teachers can give students insight as to why they learn certain content by asking students questions such as \\"what purpose is served by solving this problem?\\" and \\"why are we being asked to learn this?\\" Reflective journals help students develop metacognitive skills by having them think about their understanding. According to Pugalee, writing helps students organize their thinking which helps them better understand mathematics. Moreover, writing in mathematics classes helps students problem solve and improve mathematical reasoning. When students know how to use mathematical reasoning, they are less anxious about solving problems. However, there is still a large part of school math teaching which consists of \\"mass-produced\\" memorization, repetition, and mechanically performed operations. Times tables are one example, wherein rote learning is essential to mathematics performance. When a student fails to learn the times tables at a young age, they can experience math anxiety later, when all the students' classmates can remember the tables but they cannot. Children learn best when math is taught in a way that is relevant to their everyday lives. Children enjoy experimenting. To learn mathematics in any depth, students should be engaged in exploring, conjecturing, and thinking, as well as in rote learning of rules and procedures.http://www.marilyncurtainphillips.com See also *Cognitive science of mathematics *Dyscalculia, a specific developmental disorder *Educational psychology *Foreign language anxiety *Learning theory *Primary education *Pygmalion effect, the phenomenon whereby higher expectations lead to an increase in performance *Stage fright *Test anxiety References  External links  * Online information about and demonstration of a short mathematics anxiety test * Defence Mechanisms against Mathematics Category:Mathematics education Category:Elementary mathematics Category:Educational psychology ","title":"Mathematical anxiety"},{"id":"8111453","text":"Athens is an unincorporated community hamlet in Henry Township, Fulton County, Indiana, originally called Hoover Station.

She was portrayed by actress Michael Michele. Life at County Dr. Cleo Finch was first introduced at the start of Season 6 as a skilled new pediatric fellow at County. She was portrayed as a hard working, no-nonsense doctor who often jogged to work. Dr. Finch took over most of the pediatric storylines left void by the departures of George Clooney and Maria Bello (pediatric doctors Doug Ross and Anna Del Amico, respectively) and was portrayed as a generally competent doctor. She had a tough time early in Season 6 when she was distracted by a loud, brattily obnoxious young girl and didn't diagnose the iron poisoning that led to the girl's death. Later on that year in ‚ÄúHow The Finch Stole Christmas,\\" Cleo separated a young alcoholic patient from his alcoholic mother, who fed his addiction, during Christmastime. When no surgeons were available to perform a laparotomy on a dying patient in the aftermath of a stabbing in the ER, Dr. Finch performed an emergency thoracotomy in the OR to stabilize the patient until a surgeon could be found. She was at first reprimanded by Dr. Peter Benton, her boyfriend at the time, but he later apologized, blaming the stress of performing surgery on his friend, Dr. John Carter, a victim of the stabbing. Cleo barely responded and looked completely stunned and sorrowful, leading Peter to ask her what was wrong and her to brokenly tell him what had happened to Lucy Knight. She seemed vaguely annoyed that Dr. Carter was welcomed back to County after he went to rehab for his prescription medication addiction between Seasons 6 and 7, and briefly became angered by some issues she felt were racially tinged in Season 7, but neither storyline was maintained for very long. Relationships During the course of Season 6, Cleo started a relationship with Dr. Peter Benton. She got along well with Peter's deaf son Reese, impressing Peter with her knowledge of ASL. Cleo often clashed with Reese's mother Carla, who saw Cleo as interfering in her family's decisions and also made an unsuccessful attempt to seduce Peter. While under Cleo's care, Reese accidentally injured his hand on a piano, leading Carla to claim she was untrustworthy and irresponsible. Cleo's relationship with Peter was also put under strain when Peter felt that Cleo's bi-racial background prevented her from understanding the medical and cultural needs of the African-American community. Despite their problems, Cleo and Peter stayed together, allowing Cleo to help Peter through a difficult child-custody battle with Roger, Carla's husband, following Carla's death. Cleo took the stand to testify that she hoped to play an important role in both Peter and Reese's lives. Season 8 and Beyond In Season 8, Cleo left County for a job at a private hospital just outside Chicago. Later in the season, after winning his custody battle over Reese, Peter too departed the ER to work at the same hospital as Cleo. Their final appearance as regular characters was the episode ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be Home for Christmas,‚Äù in which they are shown helping Reese decorate a Christmas Tree. Michael Michele reprised her role as Dr. Finch in the Season 8 episode \\"On the Beach,\\" at Mark Greene‚Äôs funeral, along with Doctor Benton. During the 15th and final season of ER, at the end of the episode \\"The Book of Abby\\", long- serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Amongst them, the tag \\"Finch\\" can be seen. Later appearances by Dr. Benton in Season 15 suggested that Cleo and Peter had gotten married and were raising Reese together. Michele did not appear in any of those episodes.

Many subspecies are accepted. The species was first described by Caspar Stoll in 1790. Description Male upperside somewhat dark metallic green. Forewing: cell with two median sinuous short black transverse lines with a crimson spot between them, two similar lines beyond, one before, one after apex of cell; followed by a dark irregular transverse shading between the veins; apex of wing broadly and termen narrowly edged with an obscure dark shading. Hindwing with a slender black loop in cell; very obscure discal and sub terminal dark macular bands and the anterior third of the wing purplish. Underside sap green, largely suffused with plumbeous grey. Forewing has the transverse black slender lines and crimson spot as on the upperside; a very obscure subterminal series of dark spots parallel to terminal margin. Hindwing has three crimson spots encircled by slender black loops near base, and a very obscure subterminal series of dark spots in continuation of that on the forewing, but obsolescent posteriorly. Antennae brown; head with a crimson streak behind the eyes; thorax and abdomen greenish brown, beneath greyish. Female very similar, with precisely similar markings above and below, but the ground colour on upperside paler and especially pale on the terminal halves of the wings, in contrast with the darker basal portions. D. e. laudabilis Subspecies laudabilis C. Swinhoe: The southern Indian continental representative of D. evelina seems to form a very distinct race. The male differs in the costa of the forewing on the upperside beyond the dark obscure discal band being broadly greyish white with a silvery lustre up to a little distance before the apex of the wing; this colour spreads downwards diffusely, but does not extend below vein 6. In the female there is a similar patch, very wide on the costa, extending as a broad transverse band with outer diffuse and inner sinuous margin right across the wing to vein 1; on the hindwing it is not represented by a very much narrower transverse diffuse band or irroration of grey scales. Underside male and female, as in the typical form, but more densely suffused with plumbeous grey. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the typical form. Tamil yeomen in Kudremukha National Park, Karnataka Life history Larva: The larva of D. e. laudabilis feeds on Diospyros candolleana (Ebenaceae), and is green with a vinaceous (red-wine color) dorsal patch on each segment, enclosing a whitish dark-centred eyespot. These patches vary in size, those on the fourth, seventh and tenth segments being usually the largest, and those on the fifth and sixth small or obsolete.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 290. Geography Walloon Lake is located at the southeastern end of the lake of the same name in eastern Charlevoix County in the northwest corner of Melrose Township. The community is located just north of the outlet of the lake into the Bear River. U.S. Route 131 forms the eastern edge of the CDP and runs north to Petoskey on Little Traverse Bay and south to Boyne Falls. M-75 runs west from US 131 through the center of town, then leads southwest to Boyne City. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Walloon Lake CDP has a total area of , all of it land. History In 1872, John Jones, Jr. and his sons, Clarence and Elliot, homesteaded in the area. They helped to cut the railroad ties used to build the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railway in 1874. The stop was named \\"Melrose\\". The community applied for a post office named \\"Bear Lake\\", but there already was a Bear Lake post office in Michigan. A post office named \\"Tolcott\\" was established in October 1897, and renamed \\"Talcott\\" in March 1899, and again renamed \\"Walloon Lake\\" in September 1900. The name was suggested by a local butcher, J. R. Hass, who had seen the name on an old railroad map. An investigation into how the name came to be on the map indicated that many years earlier a group of Walloons had settled at the north end of the lake, which was then known as Bear Lake. No trace of the settlement remains. The community of Walloon Lake was listed as a newly-organized census- designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

He was a prolific writer of numerous book titles, which includes bestsellers like The Nan-Mei-Su Girls of Emerald Hill, The Ghost Lover of Emerald Hill, and the Ghosts of Singapore. He also wrote a collection of short stories in Malay. Background Goh was born in 1927 a second-generation Singapore-born Hokkien Chinese to a family of five siblings. His father was a clerk in the Yokohama Specie Bank (the former Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) at Clifford Pier while his mother was a housewife. Three generations had lived on 104 Telok Ayer Street for most of their lives, before relocating to River Valley Road. He had primary education at the Royal English School in the River Valley vicinity, and went on to the St. Joseph's Institution together with his eldest brother, Charlie Goh. In 1935 Goh attended the prestigious boys' school Raffles Institution. When the Japanese began bombing Singapore at the early stage of their invasion, the Goh family hid under a staircase at the back of their house at Emerald Hill. To avoid further bombing, the family later moved to a shophouse in Philip Road. He was a 14-year-old boy at the time of the Occupation. As a youth, he sold bread and canned goods door to door and a coal worker carrying bags of coal to support his family during the Japanese Occupation. As he was fearful of the Japanese soldiers, he had to learn to be streetwise, and to size people up quickly in order to survive, and make money to support his family. He continued his education at St Joseph's Institution. Goh also won a scholarship to study at the prestigious Raffles College (a predecessor of the National University of Singapore) and graduated with a BA in English. Career After graduation, Goh returned to SJI to teach and founded the Youth Circle Poetry interest group at the school, which attracted and encouraged aspiring writers to meet regularly to discuss about writing poetry. Among his former prot√©g√©s from the club was Edwin Thumboo, who would go on to become a prominent poet and writer in his own right. In his lifetime he was also a civil servant, serving as deputy secretary to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health between 1951 - 1969. Moving on from the Ministry, he went into banking as a project management director, and was instrumental to the building of the OCBC Centre and the Dynasty Hotel/Tangs Complex. He also was a social worker and served as chairman of the Board of Governors for the St. Joseph's Institution. He also served on positions on a number of committees of various private and governmental organizations in Singapore. In 1992 Goh, along with Mrs Hedwig Anuar, was appointed to the 69-member Publications Advisory Panel by the Minister for Information and the Arts, to advise approvals and classification of publications referred to them by the Film Censors Board and the Ministry. right Bibliography Novels * The Nan-Mei-Su Girls of Emerald Hill (1989, Heinemann Writing in Asia Series; 1998, Raffles as The Girls of Emerald Hill) Short story collections * The Battle of the Bands and Other Stories (1986, MPH Magazines; 1987, Heinemann Writing in Asia Series as Honour and Other Stories; 1998, Raffles as Honour and Other Stories) * The Ghost Lover Of Emerald Hill And Other Stories (1987, Heinemann Writing in Asia Series; 1998, Raffles) * Ghosts of Singapore!

The castle has four round towers and lies on a symmetrical artificial island. It is named after Duke Moritz of Saxony, who had a hunting lodge built there between 1542 and 1546. The surrounding woodlands and lakes have been a favourite hunting area of the electors and kings of Saxony.  History  Moritzburg Castle in 1733 Moritzburg Castle around 1800 The castle today The original castle, built from 1542‚Äì1546, was a hunting lodge for Moritz of Saxony, then Duke of Saxony.Fritz L√∂ffler: Das alte Dresden - Geschichte seiner Bauten. 16th ed. Leipzig: Seemann, 2006, (German) Elector John George II of Saxony had the lodge extended; the chapel was added between 1661 and 1671. Designed by his architect, Wolf Caspar von Klengel, the chapel is an example of early Baroque architecture. The chapel was consecrated in a Catholic rite in 1697, after the grandson of John George II, Elector Augustus II the Strong, converted to Catholicism in order to secure his election as King of Poland. Between 1723 and 1733, Augustus had the castle remodelled as a country seat by architects Matth√§us Daniel P√∂ppelmann and Zacharias Longuelune, adding a formal park, several ponds and a game preserve. The surroundings of the castle were further developed by Elector Frederick Augustus III of Saxony, a greatgrandson of Augustus II the Strong, at the end of the 18th century. The Little Pheasant Castle (Fasanenschl√∂sschen) was built between 1770 and 1776. The grounds were extended to include a building for the storage of bird nets, the large Well of Venus, living quarters for Count Camillo Marcolini and a maritime setting on the Great Lake complete with a miniature harbour with jetty and lighthouse. Prince Ernst Heinrich of Saxony, who lived in the castle between 1933 and 1945, was the last resident of the House of Wettin. He was dispossessed in 1945 by the postwar Soviet administration.  Interior of the castle  Collection of deer antlers The interior of the castle is furnished with examples of opulent baroque decor from the time of Augustus the Strong. The walls are covered in 17th century gold-gilded leather. Many rooms' furnishings are dedicated to courtly hunting. The collection of red deer antlers is one of the most important of its kind. The castle's largest collection of antlers is shown in the Speisesaal (\\"dining room\\"). Most of its 71 trophies are between 270 and 400 years old; they were purchased or acquired as presents. Among them is the heaviest red deer antler in the world, weighing and spanning almost . In the Monstr√∂sensaal (\\"monstrosity room\\"), there are 39 contorted antlers. One specimen, a 66-point red deer antler is from an animal killed by Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg in 1696.Wolfgang Kootz: Dresden, Illustrated guide to the state capital and surrounding area, B&V; Verlag, 2010, pp. 99-100. In 1723, Augustus the Strong acquired a four-poster bed for his Japanese palace. It had approximately a million peacock, pheasant, guinea hen and duck feathers woven into the canvas. Rather than gluing or tying the feathers onto the canvas, they were woven in as weft. Upon acquisition, Augustus had the curtains removed and turned into wall hangings, inspiring the room's name, Federzimmer, or \\"feather room\\". This ensemble was moved to Schloss Moritzburg in 1830. Following an extensive 19-year restoration, the bed and wall hangings have been on view again since 2003. Examples of Chinese, Japanese and Meissen porcelain are shown in the historical Porzellanquartier (\\"porcelain quarter\\"). This exhibition displays porcelain depicting hunting, exotic and mythological motifs as well as animal figurines that are relating to Moritzburg‚Äôs original determination as a hunting lodge. The apartments contain examples of opulence in the lacquered and ornate furniture, such as the Augsburg-made silver furniture styled after Louis XIV's silver furniture at Versailles. There are also engraved and inlaid weapons for hunting. The Billiardsaal (\\"billiards hall\\"), named after a former billiard table in it, contains monumental paintings on leather by Louis de Silvestre. Eleven rooms are decorated with painted leather wallpaper from the 17th century. A collection of royal carriages is shown in the entrance hall.  Park and surroundings  Map of park and surroundings In 1728, a park was added to the castle on the adjacent land to the north. The u-shaped park has an area of approximately 230 by 150 meters. The gardens are in the French style and, because of the death of Augustus the Strong, were never completed. Johann Christian Daniel, Matth√§us Daniel P√∂ppelmann and others were involved in their initial design and planning. The garden's layout follows that of other European royal courts of the time. During the 19th century, there were rare plants added and the garden was developed into a park in the romantic style. An 8-arm, star-shaped system of alleys was cut through the Friedewald, the forest on the northern side of the property. In particular, it was designed for royal fox hunting with hounds. The ruins of the Hellhaus (\\"glade house\\"), built in 1787 and designed by Johann Daniel Schade, can be found on a raised point at the intersection of the paths. It served the court hunting parties because from here, the so-called \\"swan keeper\\" would indicate the direction of flight of the game they hunted. This was done using flags, which he would raise from the top of the building. One alley running directly east, visually connects the castle with the Fasanenschl√∂sschen (\\"Little Pheasant Castle\\"), away. Not far from the Fasanenschl√∂sschen is the Well of Venus, one of the largest Baroque fountains in Saxony. It symbolizes the eastern end of a canal, which runs parallel to this corridor most of the time. During the reconstruction phase of the palace from 1723 until 1733, the large pond surrounding the castle‚Äôs artificial island was built from what was originally four smaller ponds. The other ponds in the Friedewald date from the 16th century and have been used for carp production since then. The channels connecting the ponds allow one to \\"fish\\" the carp by draining the water.

The pavilion's foundation was later used for the Chinese-style Little Pheasant Castle (Fasanenschl√∂sschen) in 1770. Elector Frederick Augustus III of Saxony had the pavilion built in the middle of the gardens. Johann Daniel Schade who had been the architect in charge of the royal building projects, received the commission for the Rococo design. Construction was completed about 1776. The shell-pink pavilion is located at the end of an alley leading to the main castle. The square building has five bays wide on each side. The high roof has an ogee profile, capped by an open cupola with a pair of Chinese figures under a parasol as a finial. Concealed behind plantings to give the pavilion an isolated ambience, were outbuildings used to breed pheasants for use in hunting. The few rooms, including the elector's study, are furnished with original trappings. The Rococo finishes include murals on canvas, inlaid wood paneling, painted and gilded stucco ceilings, and unique finishes crafted from materials like embroidered silk, straw, pearls and feathers. The interiors were restored between 2009 and 2013 through a collaboration between Ostdeutsche Sparkassenstiftung, Sparkasse Mei√üen, and World Monuments Fund. On the front of the building, there is a double-flight stairway leading to the lake with a miniature harbour and jetty. There is also a painted brick lighthouse high. The miniature harbour was used to stage naval battles for the monarch's amusement. In order to re-enact the famous Battle of Chesma, the Dardanelles, a miniature wall representing the original castles at the narrow strait in northwestern Turkey, were also built. Today, the harbour is partly silted because the lake‚Äôs water level is approximately lower than before. On the garden side of the castle, a pair of staircases descend to a sunken parterre, now planted with turf.  Trivia  In 1972 Moritzburg Castle was one of the locations of the Czechoslovak-German film T≈ôi o≈ô√≠≈°ky pro Popelku (\\"Three Nuts for Cinderella\\"), which became a popular fairy-tale movie in Central Europe.

In the decades following the war, P√©r√°k has also been portrayed as a Czech superhero.  History  According to historians Callum McDonald and Jan Kaplan in their book Prague in the Shadow of the Swastika: a History of the German Occupation 1939-1945 (London, 1995), \\"the Springer\\" was said to leap out from shadowy alleys and startle passers- by.McDonald, Callum and Jan Kaplan: Prague in the Shadow of the Swastika: a History of the German Occupation 1939-1945 (London 1995) 137. Oral tradition suggests that some of P√©r√°k's leaps were of an extraordinary magnitude, including the act of jumping over train carriages, similar to England's Spring-heeled Jack. A contemporary and possibly associated rumour concerned a \\"Razor Blade Man\\" who was said to slash at victims with razors attached to his fingers. Researcher Mike Dash quotes George Zenaty, a noted authority on the policing of Prague during the war years, that:Dash, Mike: Spring-Heeled Jack Fortean Studies 3 (1996), 7-125 In 2015 a social activist claiming the identity of P√©r√°k fronted a guerilla media campaign to commemorate the former site of the Lety concentration camp. The 2017 book M√Ωtus o p√©r√°kovi. Mƒõstsk√° legenda mezi folklorem a popul√°rn√≠ kulturou by Czech folklorist Petr Janeƒçek offers a comprehensive survey of the Perak phenomenon, tracing a history from the figure of Spring Heeled Jack in England during the early 19th century through to Czech folklore before, during and after World War 2, and then into popular culture via a succession of speculative fiction novels, comic book treatments and other works of fiction.  P√©r√°k in fiction   Film  A 14-minute 1946 Czechoslovak animated cartoon P√©r√°k a SS (Springman and the SS, also released in English-speaking markets as The Chimney Sweep) was created by the renowned Czech animator Ji≈ô√≠ Trnka and film-maker Ji≈ô√≠ Brdeƒçka. It portrayed P√©r√°k as a heroic and mischievous black-clad chimney sweep, with a mask fashioned out of a sock. He was capable of performing fantastic leaps due to having couch springs attached to his shoes. P√©r√°k taunted German Army sentries, the Gestapo and, particularly, a Hitleresque Nazi collaborator before escaping in a surrealistic, slapstick chase across the darkened city, ultimately freeing a number of incarcerated citizens of Prague. Trnka's postwar interpretation of P√©r√°k as a quasi-superhero, defying the curfew and the authority of the German occupying forces, formed the basis for sporadic revivals of the character in Czech science fiction and comic book stories. In 2013, the first short feature film P√©r√°k (P√©r√°k: Gott mit uns) was directed by Pavel Soukup ml. It is in the noir/mystery genre. In 2016, Marek Berger created an animated film P√©r√°k: St√≠n nad Prahou (P√©r√°k: The Shadow over Prague). The film has won 2 awards at International Student Film Festival in Opava - for best animated film and absolute best film.  Literature  In Petr Stanƒç√≠k's fiction, the Libe≈à gasholder serves as a base for P√©r√°k In 1948, the figure was used in a newspaper propaganda comics in Hal√≥ noviny. It was visually based on Trnka's animated film. Fifteen pages were published. In 1961, P√©r√°k was featured as a heroic character in the story \\"P√©rov√Ω mu≈æ\\" (\\"The Spring-Man\\"), which was written by Czech science fiction writer Jan Weiss and published as part of a collection of short stories entitled Bianka Braselli, A Two-Headed Lady. In his 1997 biographical essay on Weiss, Vil√©m Kmun√≠ƒçek speculated that the inspiration for this story was in response to Nazi propaganda:Kmun√≠ƒçek, Vil√©m: Jan Weiss dnes (Jan Weiss Nowadays) Z ƒåesk√©ho r√°je a Podkrkono≈°√≠, vol. 10, 1997, 109‚Äì128. In 1968, the issue of the Mlad√Ω svƒõt magazine, published after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, included a four-strip comics titled P√©r√°k and the USSR. In 1986, Czech science fiction writer Ond≈ôej Neff also portrayed P√©r√°k as a heroic figure in P√©r√°k ‚Äì Toho dne byla mlha (Perak - There was fog that day). In 2001, he created a humorous satirical comic strip titled P√©r√°k kontra Globeman (P√©r√°k versus Globalman) which conflates the figures of the Springer and the Razor Blade Man and pits him against a villain called Globalman, who bears a strong resemblance to McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald.Neff, Ondrej: Perak, cesky super-hero [1989] In 2002, the cartoonist Adolf Lachman, in cooperation with scriptwriters Monge and Morten, intended to produce a new series of comic strips about P√©r√°k. But only the introductory chapter came out as part of the KomiksFest! Revue 03 magazine. Ethnologist Petr Janeƒçek was since 2004 dedicated to scientific research of P√©r√°k, he collected a considerable amount of stories from witnesses. In 2017, he issued a comprehensive publication M√Ωtus o P√©r√°kovi. Mƒõstsk√° legenda mezi folklorem a popul√°rn√≠ kulturou (Myth of P√©r√°k. Urban legend between folklore and popular culture). The right to use the name P√©r√°k was in 2006 ensured by Petr Stanƒç√≠k. First, he wrote a screenplay to movie, but in 2008 only a book with its fictionalized version was published by the author, portraying him as a World War II-era costumed superhero who battles the Gestapo with the aid of various weapons and mechanical spring-powered boots. In 2019, the book was translated into German and published as: P√©r√°k. Der Superheld aus Prag. Since spring 2018, comics about P√©r√°k have been published in the Czech ABC magazine, its authors are artist Petr Kopl and screenwriter Petr Macek. Their portrayal of P√©r√°k follows the character's appearance in their comics magazine Dechberouc√≠ Z√°zrak 09 (Breathtaking Miracle 09). In May 2019, the collected and extended edition of the series, originally published in ABC magazine, was released as a separate book P√©r√°k: Oko budoucnosti (P√©r√°k: Eye of the future). Theater Since 2011, the Vosto5 Theater in Prague has been presenting an action historical fiction called P√©r√°k - na jm√©nƒõ nez√°le≈æ√≠, rozhoduj√≠ ƒçiny!. The plot is placed in the real historical context of the period from the arrival of Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich to Prague, until his assassination. In this production, Vosto5 combines elements of martial arts and extreme sports with a typical theater poetics and its verbal humor.

History  Penicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus appeared very soon after penicillin entered general clinical use in 1943, and the mechanism of resistance was the production of Œ≤-lactamase. Modification of the penicillin molecule so that it was resistant to being broken down by Œ≤-lactamase was able to temporarily overcome this problem. These compounds became known as antistaphylococcal penicillins. The first of these compounds was methicillin, which is no longer in general use.

It is currently owned by American General Media. Its studios are located in Northeast Albuquerque (a mile north of Central Avenue and the transmitter tower is located west of Los Alamos, New Mexico. History KIVA (1985-1991) 105.1 signed on in Fall 1985 as KIVA with a hot adult contemporary format in an effort to challenge KOB-FM. The station was owned by Constant Communications. In November 1986, Constant sold KIVA to the Daytona Group for $1.9 million (at auction).https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX- Business/Magazines/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/80s/86/RR-1986-11-21-OCR- Page-0012.pdf KIVA would then shift to a Top 40 format and rebranded as \\"Power 105\\". Daytona would then purchase KXAK 1310 for $425,000 in May 1987.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-05-29.pdf 1310 became KIVA while 105.1 became KIVA-FM and would simulcast the programming in AM stereo for about a year.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/48352988/citys-fun-channel-no-longer-on- the-air/ On December 1, 1989, the station would replace the local programming with a satellite delivered format called \\"The Heat\\" from Satellite Music Networks in Dallas, TX; while 20 employees at the station were laid off. However the ratings for the station would fall near the bottom by 1991 while KKSS 97.3 would rank near the top.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Duncan-American- Radio/Duncan-1991-Summer.pdf page 8 In December 1991 Daytona would sell KIVA/KZRQ 1310 to Star of New Mexico for $300,000.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1991/RR-1991-12-20.pdf At this time the Top 40 format would be replaced by SMN's Z-Rock network, which played Hard rock and Heavy metal music.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-M-Street/M-Street- Journal/M-Street-1992-01.pdf Z-Rock (1991-1996) Z-Rock had aired locally on then sister-station 1310 AM since September 8, 1988. Although a \\"narrow casting\\" effort, the station intended to capitalized on the local popularity of rock and metal. In 1992, the call-letters of both stations were switched with 105.1 becoming KZRQ and the KIVA callsign moving to 1310 which had launched an Adult Standards format that April. It was around this time that Z-Rock would also begin to pick up more FM affiliates around the country under programming director Lee Abrams. While the format was national, there would be some local features on the station, as well as some local bands. In July 1993, Star Management sold KZRQ and KIVA to Territorial Communications for $900,000 with KZRQ forming an FM duopoly with oldies formatted KZKL 101.7.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1993/RR-1993-07-09.pdf page 8 Throughout 1995, KZRQ featured a local \\"night shift\\" program from 6 PM until midnight. In November 1995 Territorial Communications would enter into a merger with Simmons Media Group to acquire the two AM and two FM stations. KZRQ was placed into a sales management agreement while awaiting a relaxation of ownership limits in 1996 as Simmons had just purchased KIOT 102.5.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-M-Street/M-Street- Journal/M-Street-1995-11.pdf In April 1996, Simmons would buy out 80% of Territorial for $5 million.https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-04-12.pdf; page 8 Many changes (1996-2006) In January 1996, Simmons discontinued the Z-Rock affiliation, and flipped KZRQ to a Hot Adult Contemporary format branded as \\"Star 105\\", attempting to challenge the more established KKOB-FM. Later, the format would briefly shift to Rhythmic AC; however, the format wouldn't last long due to low ratings.http://fmairchecks.com/category/albuquerque-nm/105-1-kzrq- star-105-fm/feed/ In May 1997, 105.1 would pick up the Smooth Jazz format moved over from 101.3 as well as the KRZN callsign. The station was branded as \\"The Horizon\\". The new signal made the format available to Santa Fe and other surrounding communities. However, after two years and being unable to turn a profit, \\"The Horizon\\" ended in April 1999.HighBeam 105.1 then switched to a mainstream top 40/CHR format, branded as \\"Channel 105one\\", becoming the first mainstream CHR station in the market in six years with the format enjoying a resurgence nationally at that time. The callsign then changed to KCHQ. KKOB-FM would also pick up a top 40 format soon after and the two stations would be in a head-to-head battle in the ratings. On November 7, 2000, the same day as the United States Presidential Election, KCHQ would change to an all-80's hits format while keeping the \\"Channel\\" brand.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-11-10.pdf KKOB-FM would also change to the 80's format in early 2001, putting the two stations in direct competition once again with sister-station KKSS picking up the top 40/CHR format in March 2001. The format was dropped on 105.1 in November 2001. Simmons, meanwhile, had revived the \\"Horizon\\" smooth jazz format on 101.3 in December 2000. It would once again be moved back to 105.1 in November 2001, along with the call letters KRQS. In 2002, Simmons would sell its FM radio stations to Hispanic Broadcasting Company for $22.5 million.https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/stories/2002/11/04/daily2.html HBC would keep the smooth jazz format on 105.1, but would change the call letters to KAJZ. By April 2004, the \\"Horizon\\" format would move over to the weaker 101.7 signal. HBC became Univision Radio in 2003. After KAJZ moved to 101.7, 105.1 would revive a classic country format that had previously aired on 101.3 from late 2001 until November 2002, when HBC acquired the FM station cluster. The KKRG call letters would be picked up and the station would be branded as \\"The Range\\". While \\"The Range\\" had good ratings, Univision had dropped the format in March 2006 in favor of its \\"Recuerdo\\" Mexican oldies format. By the end of that year, Univision would switch formats, moving Regional Mexican KJFA from 101.3 to 105.1, while \\"Recuerdo\\" and the KKRG call letters moved to 101.3. La Jefa (2006-2015) KJFA logo 105.1 enjoyed a long period of stability following the switch to KJFA which ran for over 8 years. KJFA started in November 2002 on the 101.3 frequency, but moved to 105.1 in late December 2006 by switching with KKRG, which, at the time, had a Mexican Oldies format branded as \\"Recuerdo\\", over to 101.3 which only covers the Albuquerque metropolitan area. The Piolin morning program had also been added at the beginning of 2007 as part of the effort to make the station more competitive with KLVO. These changes had helped make KJFA the new top Arbitron rated Spanish-language radio station in Albuquerque and creating a more competitive battle with the long running \\"Lobo\\" until that station had dropped the format in January 2011. The format and brand was revived in November 2012. On July 22, 2013, Univision had cancelled the Piolin program.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84289/univision-cancels-piolin/ KJFA had seen a drop in ratings since then and has been in a low rated battle with KLVO with then adult hits formatted KRZY-FM \\"Jose 105.9\\" often leading among Spanish-language radio stations in the market. Piolin was picked up by rival KLVO in January 2015, resulting in a surge in ratings for that station. Piolin Returns to Terrestrial Radio Piolin has since moved to middays on Entravision-owned KRZY-FM \\"La Suavecita\\". 2015-present Former logo as Yo! 105.1 On September 28, 2015, Univision moved KJFA back to 101.3 while moving the classic hip-hop format of KKRG to 105.1. With the frequency swap, KJFA changed its call sign to KKRG-FM. Univision Swaps Two Albuquerque Formats The station would be branded as \\"Yo! 105.1\\". On June 14, 2017, American General Media announced that it would acquire KKRG-FM (along with sister stations KKSS and KIOT), making them part of a cluster with KABG, KLVO and KARS/K275AO.

He was of noble birth, of the Jonschwyl family in Toggenburg, and was educated in the monastery of St. Gall; after joining the Benedictine Order, he was appointed director of the inner school there. Later, under Abbot Kralo, who trusted him implicitly, he was elected dean of the monastery, and for a while directed all the affairs of the abbey. Ekkehard made a pilgrimage to Rome, where he was retained for a time by Pope John XII, who presented him with various relics of St. John the Baptist. After Kralo's death Ekkehard refused the abbatial succession, because of lameness resulting from a fractured leg. However, he directed the choice of Burkard, son of Count Ulrich of Buchhorn, who governed St. Gall with the advice and co- operation of Ekkehard. The latter erected a hospice in front of the monastery for the sick and strangers, and was in many other ways a model of charity. He was also distinguished as a poet, and wrote a Latin epic \\"Waltharius\\", basing his version on an original German text. He dedicated this poem to Bishop Erkanbald of Strasburg (965-991). It describes the elopement of Walter of Aquitaine with the Burgundian princess Hildegunde, from the land of the Huns, followed by the battle of Wasgenstein between Walter and the followers of Gunther and Hagen (ed. Peiper, Berlin, 1873). He also composed various ecclesiastical hymns and sequences, e. g. in honour of the Blessed Trinity, St. John the Baptist, St. Benedict, St. Columbanus and St. Stephen (Meyer, \\"Philologische Bemerkungen zum Waltharius\\" in \\"Abhandl. der bayr.

In 1976 they had written Richard Clayderman's multimillion-selling instrumental \\"Ballade pour Adeline\\". \\"Une petite fran√ßaise\\" is a mid-tempo ballad, with Torr describing herself as an average Frenchwoman, rather than the cosmopolitan types more commonly associated with that country. She confides that she is no Marilyn, she never reads about her own life in the magazines, she doesn't own a Rolls, she doesn't consider herself an idol, she hasn't read Pascal, she rarely visits Paris, she hasn't changed her name, she leads a quiet provincial life with her children - she just happens to be country girl from Provence who likes to sing. She asks her audience to be the judge of whether she should have left her home for a career in music.

He held many positions in the era of the Kingdom of Libya and was the tenth Prime Minister of Libya from 4 September 1968 to 31 August 1969, when his government was overthrown by Muammar Gaddafi (no relation).  Biography  Qaddafi was born in Benghazi, Italian Cyrenaica, in 1922, into the distinguished House of Shennib. During the Italian colonial period, an Italian lawyer trained him for a career in law. According to some accounts, during the Second World War he fled with his family to Sudan, only returning to his country after it was occupied by the British. The young Qaddafi was taken up by the Allied Forces overseeing the administration of Benghazi and was the first Libyan to be recruited by the British for the political administration of Cyrenaica. Following the independence of Libya in 1951, he became a provincial minister in Cyrenaica, first of health, later of justice and transportation, and chaired Cyrenaica's Executive Council.

It has a population of 5,536 (2015). Name Its original name was Smiltesele (the ending probably came from the Russian \\"selo\\" - village), later it was called Smilten in German before adding the Latvian ending and thus becoming Smiltene.The name of Smiltene through time (Latvian) Geography Smiltene is located in the northern part of the Vidzeme Highland on the banks of the river Abuls (Abula). It was formerly in Valka District prior to the reorganization of 2009, which eliminated districts, and placed the town as part of Smiltene Municipality. The town centre is 106 metres above the sea level, the highest spot is on Klievu street - 145.14 metres above the sea level. There are three possible meteorite craters in Smiltene. History The area around Smiltene was a part of the Latgalian lands of TƒÅlava. After Crusaders had taken over most of the modern day Latvia, the area was part of the lands of the bishop of Riga. In 1359 on the steep hill near the river Abuls was built a castle. The tradesmen and craftsmen village around it - Smiltestele - first is mentioned in historical documents in 1427, since 1523 it was called a town. During the Livonian war the castle and the town were brought to ruin by the army of Ivan the Terrible. Under Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth Smiltene and the area surrounding it were controlled by the starosta Kaspar Mlodecki. In the early stages of the Great Northern War Smiltene was burnt down by the Russian army. After the war the area became devastated due to hunger and Bubonic plague. In 1708 the Swedish government built a new church and started the restoration of the village of Smiltene. In 1760 the Russian empress Catherine II gave Smiltene manor as a present to the Governor-General Georg von Braun (Yuri Broun).

The also triangular fenestrae antorbitales are smaller than the orbits. The teeth differ in shape and the species was thus heterodont. Most teeth are small and tricuspid or three-pointed. In the front of the upper jaw five larger recurved teeth with a single point form a prey grab; six or seven such teeth are also interspersed with the smaller teeth more to the back of the mouth. There are at least seventeen and perhaps as much as 25 tricuspid teeth in the upper jaw, for a total of perhaps 74 teeth of all sizes in the skull. The number of teeth in the lower jaws cannot be determined. The flexible tail did not have the stiffening rod-like vertebral extensions present in other basal pterosaurs. The wingspan has been estimated at about 120 cm. Austriadactylus was in 2002 assigned by the describers to a general Pterosauria incertae sedis, but some later analyses showed it to have been related to Campylognathoides and Eudimorphodon in the Campylognathoididae. It has even been suggested it was a junior synonym of Eudimorphodon, though perhaps a distinct species in that genus. The following phylogenetic analysis follows the topology of Upchurch et al. (2015).

There was a Youth Hostel at Taitlands between 1942 and 2007. History Stainforth Falls, Its name derives from the 'stony ford' which linked two settlements half a mile apart on opposite banks of the River Ribble north of Settle. Stainforth, on the eastern side, was formerly owned by Sawley Abbey, whose monks developed the estate which prospered, while Little Stainforth, under private ownership, declined. In 1595 Edward Darcy received from four trustees acting for the previous owner the manor of Stainforth Underbargh and 20 dwelling houses with lands there. He was Groom of the Chamber to Elizabeth I and was knighted eight years later. In the 1670s, Samuel Watson replaced the ford by a packhorse bridge whose arch spans a wooded stretch of the river, and a grassy patch leads downstream to Stainforth Force. In Little Stainforth the three-storey Stainforth Hall was built at the same time and is now occupied as a farmhouse.

Geography It covers an area of and has a population of 636 people (2001). Position Beregsurany can be reached through the road 4127, lying on the northern side of the international Hungarian‚ÄìUkrainian border crossing point, about 70 km from Ny√≠regyh√°za, the center of the county.  Origin of the name  The prefix Bereg means 'belonging to the long-ago Bereg shire', the origin of the Surany forename is maybe the Slavish 'Su ran' family name, or the ancient Turkish magistracy 'cur'.  History  Until 1911, the village was called simple Surany. The current settlement is melted from the smaller villages Nagysurany and Kissurany. The settlement was the residency of the family Suranyi originated from the genum of Gutkeled or family Vardai. From 1280, there was a tough hostility between Aladar (son of Mihaly) and Tamas (son of Gabor). In 1299 the family Vardai owned the settlement, that time called Egyhazassurany. In 1345 Janos Suranyi and his son, Tamas, has litigated with Janos Kisvardai for the countryside border-land between Marok and Surany. Nagy- and Kissurany was owned in the 14th century by the families Nagysuranyi, Kissuranyi, Medgyes and Csepan (from Barabas). In 1496 Kissurany was recorded as praedium, that is desert. In 1567 Tartars have ruined and burned Nagysurany, dragging the population away. Charters from 1648 mention Istvan Telegdi, Gabor Perneszi, the widow of Menyhert Lonyay, Zsigmond Ujfalusi, Zsigmond and Gabor Perenyi, Gabor Barkoczi and Adam Dessewffy as proprietaries. In 1651 Katalin Bornemissza (the widow of Gyorgy Perenyi and Ferenc Kallay), her descendants, further, Istvan Salyi and his wife Zsuzsanna Fulo became proprietaries, as well. In 1729 Istvan, Mihaly and Eva Bay Ludanyi and in 1807 Istvan Bay became owners of areas near Surany. In 1822 Jozsef and Karoly Bay had properties there, and after 50 years, mrs Gyorgy Bay, Ferenc, Jozsef and Erzsebet Bay, baron Gyula Uray, Gabor Lonyay and Jeno Eotvos had aesthetical residences there. (The family Bay (originated from shire Nograd) has settled in Surany through marriage in the 17th century, although the heads of the family are mentioned among the \\"illustrious men\\" of shire Bereg. Specially Mihaly Bay was the wice leader of the shire, who left the country with Imre Tokholy and lived in Asia, leaving his goods to his brother Andras. In his last will and testament, Tokholy bequeathed a patrician courtyard to Mihaly Bay. Mihaly Bay redeemed the courtyard at Rakoczi Ferenc II , in this contract Rakoczi enumerated the merits Mihaly Bay reached by serving Ilona Zrinyi and Imre Th√∂k√∂ly.) The military descriptors of shire Bereg between 1782-1825 found a swampy forest of oaks, birchs and beech. The roads and meadows were also swampy, good hay could be collected only in the sparse woods beside the closest settlement Aszt√©ly. In the east from the village, the highway was forked, the branch going to Munkacs had hard ground, was quiet wide in the forest and carried just next to Surany. The one going through the village went to Beregszasz, the third one, going to V√°ri was lesser-busy since its poor state. However, the road coming from Tarpa was hardly viable in rainy weather. The Geographian Dictionary written by Elek F√©nyes describes Surany as a Hungarian-Slovakian/Slovenian village in the shire Bereg, having 617 inhabitants, many woods and fat fields. In the monography of the sire Bereg written 30 years later, it is mentioned as a Hungarian settlement in the region Tiszah√°t, near the road to Nam√©ny, having 104 dwelling-houses, 686 inhabitants and 2630 acres of countryside. (In its flat countryside many brazen finds were found and said to be from the ancient times, like in 1879 on the fields of Gyula Uray, more than 40 brazen armlets and a lance was unearthed in a mug. Near the streamlet Mic sometime there was a fortress, probably an earth stronghold called Varszeg. In the 13th century Pazmanyfolde settlement lay in the lower border of the shire Bereg, near Surany and Marok, named after its first proprietary, genum Hunt-Pazman.)  Local Curiosities  Mihaly Nagyszolosi ecclesiastical writer was the Roman Catholic priest of the village in the second half of the 17th century. Gyorgy Bay was born in 1792 in Surany and in 1815 he became a bodyguard of Maria Theresa. During his residence in Vienna he got known Karoly Kisfaludy and due to his influence, Gyorgy Bay began rhyming. In 1820 he moved back in Surany, corresponding with Ferenc Kazinczy and besides rhyming, he dealt with translations of poems and romans, as well.  Nationalities  In 2001, almost 100% of the inhabitants professed to be Hungarian.Dataset of nationalities from the census made in 2001  Sights  Under Rakoczi street 2, the art relic reformed church can be found. According to the first notes from 1299, it was probably a wooden church, since the current one was built from stones in the second half of the 14th century. The main room and the much lower, groined cross vaulted sanctuary is built in gothic style, to the edges of the sanctum, two-divided pillars are leaning from outside. In the western room wooden balcony can be found, above the peaked triumphal arch the year 1715 can be read. Under the lime coating of the northern wall, murals from the middle-ages are hiding. The sitting chamber arises from the 14th century, the furniture, including the stone pulpit with grawen louder originates from the 18th century, with demotic baroque decorations. The church was renovated in 1715 and 1779, in 1828, judge Karoly Bay had made build the charnel-house of the family, just in front of the chairs of the patrons. The tower of the church and the building afore it, comes from the 19th century. On the uppermost floor of the three storeyed tower four arch-type window can be found. The cap with clock shelf has shuttered windowlets on each side of it. On the left side of the road going through the settlement, under Arpad street 115, nice sight is waiting for foreigners. The sometime Bay-castle is one of the rare art-relic barque mansions of the Bereg county. Based on its style-marks, the garrett-roofed mansion standing on high footing was built in the end of the 18th century, or beginning of the 19th century. Probably the family Bay had made build it. In Surany they had a wooden mansion already in the last third of the 17th century. For a long time, the kindergarten of the local government was operating in it. In 2006, it went through a full renovation, currently it is standing empty. Under Rakoczi street 1., in a large park can be seen the arc- relic sometime Uray-castle. The building was made built by the family Uray in the middle of the 19th century. The one-storied building has portico closed with tympanum on both the front and garden side frontage. Its exterior and interior is also simple with romantic details. It is the propriety of the local government, currently the mayor's office is operating in it. The memorial of World War II can be seen in the park of the Uray-castle, (which is called today B√°r√≥kert). In the village a private collection of local history can be found.

The act was originally enacted by the colonial authorities of British Malaya in 1948. The act criminalises speech with \\"seditious tendency\\", including that which would \\"bring into hatred or contempt or to excite disaffection against\\" the government or engender \\"feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races\\". The meaning of \\"seditious tendency\\" is defined in section 3 of the Sedition Act 1948 and in substance it is similar to the English common law definition of sedition, with modifications to suit local circumstances.See for example James Fitzjames Stephen's \\"Digest of the Criminal Law\\" which states that under English law \\"a seditious intention is an intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to exite disaffection against the person of His Majesty, his heirs or successors, or the government and constitution of the United Kingdom, as by law established, or either House of Parliament, or the administration of justice, or to excite His Majesty's subjects to attempt otherwise than by lawful means, the alteration of any matter in Church or State by law established, or to incite any person to commit any crime in disturbance of the peace, or to raise discontent or disaffection amongst His Majesty's subjects, or to promote feelings of ill- will and hostility between different classes of such subjects.\\" The Malaysian definition has of course been modified to suit local circumstance and in particular, it includes acts or things done \\"to question any matter, right, status, position, privilege, sovereignty or prerogative established or protected by the provisions of Part III of the Federal Constitution or Article 152, 153 or 181 of the Federal Constitution.\\" The Malaysian definition includes the questioning of certain portions of the Constitution of Malaysia, namely those pertaining to the Malaysian social contract, such as Article 153, which deals with special rights for the bumiputra (Malays and other indigenous peoples, who comprise over half the Malaysian population). Structure The Sedition Act 1948, in its current form (4 June 2015), consists of 11 sections and no schedule (including 6 amendments), without separate Part. *Section 1: Short title *Section 2: Interpretation *Section 3: Seditious tendency *Section 4: Offences *Section 5: Legal proceedings *Section 5A: Power of court to prevent person from leaving Malaysia *Section 6: Evidence *Section 6A: Non- application of sections 173A, 293 and 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code *Section 7: Innocent receiver of seditious publication *Section 8: Issue of search warrant *Section 9: Suspension of newspaper containing seditious matter *Section 10: Power of court to prohibit circulation of seditious publications *Section 10A: Special power to issue order regarding seditious publications by electronic means *Section 11: Arrest without warrant History The law was introduced by the British in 1948, the same year that the autonomous Federation of Malaya came into being, with the intent of curbing opposition to colonial rule.Article 19 Global Campaign for Free Expression (2003). \\"Memorandum on Malaysian Sedition Act 1948\\" . Retrieved 25 November 2006. The law remained on the statute books through independence in 1957, and the merger with Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore that formed Malaysia. The Federal Constitution of Malaya and later Malaysia permitted Parliament to impose restrictions on the freedom of speech granted by the Constitution. After the May 13 Incident, when racial riots in the capital of Kuala Lumpur led to at least 200 deaths, the government amended the Constitution to expand the scope of limitations on freedom of speech. The Constitution (Amendment) Act 1971 named Articles 152, 153, and 181, and also Part III of the Constitution as specially protected, permitting Parliament to pass legislation that would limit dissent with regard to these provisions pertaining to the social contract. (The social contract is essentially a quid pro quo agreement between the Malay and non-Malay citizens of Peninsular Malaysia; in return for granting the non-Malays citizenship at independence, symbols of Malay authority such as the Malay monarchy became national symbols, and the Malays were granted special economic privileges.) With this new power, Parliament then amended the Sedition Act accordingly. The new restrictions also applied to Members of Parliament, overruling Parliamentary immunity; at the same time, Article 159, which governs Constitutional amendments, was amended to entrench the \\"sensitive\\" Constitutional provisions; in addition to the consent of Parliament, any changes to the \\"sensitive\\" portions of the Constitution would now have to pass the Conference of Rulers, a body comprising the monarchs of the Malay states.Khoo, Boo Teik (1995). Paradoxes of Mahathirism, pp. 104-106\\\\. Oxford University Press. . These later amendments were harshly criticised by the opposition parties in Parliament, who had campaigned for greater political equality for non-Malays in the 1969 general election. Despite their opposition, the ruling Alliance (later Barisan Nasional) coalition government passed the amendments, having maintained the necessary two-thirds Parliamentary majority. In Britain, the laws were condemned, with The Times of London stating they would \\"preserve as immutable the feudal system dominating Malay society\\" by \\"giving this archaic body of petty constitutional monarchs incredible blocking power\\"; the move was cast as hypocritical, given that Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak had spoken of \\"the full realization that important matters must no longer be swept under the carpet...\\"Emery, Fred (8 Nov. 1969). \\"Malaysia unity call against a background of fear\\", p. 7. The Times. Provisions The Sedition Act would be unconstitutional, as the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, without Article 10(2) of the Constitution, which permits Parliament to enact \\"such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or of any Legislative Assembly or to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to any offence\\". Article 10(4) also states that \\"Parliament may pass law prohibiting the questioning of any matter, right, status, position, privilege, sovereignty or prerogative established or protected by the provisions of Part III, article 152, 153 or 181 otherwise than in relation to the implementation thereof as may be specified in such law\\". These portions of the Constitution have been criticised by human rights advocates, who charge that \\"under the Malaysian Constitution, the test is not whether or not the restriction is necessarily but the much lower standard of whether or not Parliament deems the restrictions necessary or even expedient. There is no objective requirement that the restriction actually is necessary or expedient and the latter standard is much lower than that of necessity.\\" Section 4 of the Sedition Act specifies that anyone who \\"does or attempts to do, or makes any preparation to do, or conspires with any person to do\\" an act with seditious tendency, such as uttering seditious words, or printing, publishing or importing seditious literature, is guilty of sedition. It is also a crime to possess a seditious publication without a \\"lawful excuse\\". The act defines sedition itself as anything which \\"when applied or used in respect of any act, speech, words, publication or other thing qualifies the act, speech, words, publication or other thing as having a seditious tendency\\". Under section 3(1), those acts defined as having a seditious tendency are acts with a tendency: Section 3(2) provides certain exceptions, providing examples of speech which cannot be deemed seditious. It is not seditious to \\"show that any Ruler has been misled or mistaken in any of his measures\\", nor is it seditious \\"to point out errors or defects in the Government or Constitution as by law established\\". It is also not seditious \\"to attempt to procure by lawful means the alteration of any matter in the territory of such Government as by law established\\" or \\"to point out, with a view to their removal, any matters producing or having a tendency to produce feelings of ill-will and enmity between different races or classes of the population of the Federation\\". However, the act explicitly states that any matter covered by subsection (1)(f), namely those matters pertaining to the Malaysian social contract, cannot have these exceptions applied to it. Section 3(3) goes on to state that \\"the intention of the person charged at the time he did or attempted (a seditious act) ... shall be deemed to be irrelevant if in fact the act had, or would, if done, have had, or the words, publication or thing had a seditious tendency\\". This latter provision has been criticised for overruling mens rea, a legal principle stating that a person cannot be guilty of a crime if he did not have the intent to commit a crime. A person found guilty of sedition may be sentenced to three years in jail, a RM5,000 fine, or both. Implementation In 2003, then Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi threatened to charge opponents of a change in educational policy with sedition. In recent times, the law has invoked to quell political opposition to the government. Famously in 2000, Marina Yusoff, a former vice president of the National Justice Party (Parti Keadilan Nasional) was charged with sedition for alleging that the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the leading party in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, had provoked the massacres of Chinese in the May 13 Incident. The editor of an opposition organ was charged with sedition for alleging a government conspiracy against Anwar Ibrahim, a former Deputy Prime Minister, had led to his political downfall; Anwar's lead counsel, Karpal Singh, who was also deputy chairman of the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP), had also been charged with sedition after claiming Anwar had been poisoned by \\"people in high places\\". Lim Guan Eng, a former Member of Parliament from the DAP, had likewise been found guilty of sedition in 1998 for accusing the Attorney General of failing to properly handle a case where the Chief Minister of Malacca had been charged with statutory rape of a schoolgirl. In 2003, the act was also invoked by then Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (who succeeded Mahathir bin Mohamad as Prime Minister of Malaysia later that year); Abdullah stated that the government would charge those who opposed the change in educational policy emphasising the teaching of science and mathematics in English with sedition. That same year, the online publication Malaysiakini was temporarily shut down under the Sedition Act after it published a letter criticising Malay special rights and compared the Youth wing of a government party to the Ku Klux Klan. Previously in 1978, the Sedition Act had been invoked in another case of educational policy, when Mark Koding argued in Parliament that the government ought to close down Chinese and Tamil vernacular schools.Singh, Bhag (12 Dec. 2006). Seditious speeches . Malaysia Today. Human rights advocates have alleged that the Sedition Act has an \\"excessively vague\\" definition of sedition. These critics charge that this vagueness constitutes \\"an invitation to abuse and authorities may seek to apply them in situations which bear no relation to the original purpose of the law\\". Although they concede that the act provides exceptions that would \\"clarify and narrow the scope of the offence\\", they allege that \\"Any rule which needs an exception in favour of pointing out that the rulers are misled is quite obviously unacceptably vague.\\" It is also claimed that the Malaysian judiciary has \\"given an extremely wide interpretation to the crime of sedition\\", with the result of a chilling effect on open dissent to government policies. In 2006, the DAP, which had been a vocal opponent of the Sedition Act and the Internal Security Act (ISA), filed a police report against UMNO, whose annual general assembly had been noted for its heated rhetoric, with delegates making statements such as \\"Umno is willing to risk lives and bathe in blood to defend the race and religion. Don't play with fire. If they (non- Malays) messed with our rights, we will mess with theirs.\\"Lopez, Leslie (17 Nov. 2006). Race rhetoric is part of Umno politics. Malaysia Today. In response, Information Minister Zainuddin Maidin said that this indicated that the Sedition Act continued to remain relevant to Malaysian society. He also denied that the government intentionally used the act to silence dissent or to advance particular political interests.DAP proves Sedition Act still relevant: Zam. (28 Nov. 2006).

Angustinaripterus was named in 1983 by He Xinlu. The type species is Angustinaripterus longicephalus. The genus name is derived from Latin angustus, \\"narrow\\" and naris, \\"nostril\\", combined with Latinized Greek pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name is derived from Latin longus, \\"long\\", and Greek kephale, \\"head\\". The holotype, ZDM T8001, is a single skull with lower jaws, found in 1981 by researchers from the Zigong Historical Museum of the Salt Industry, in the Xiashaximiao Formation (Bathonian). The skull, of which the left side is severely damaged, is very elongated and flat. The back part is missing; in its preserved state it has a length of 192 millimetres; the total length in a complete state was estimated at 201 millimetres. On its top is a low crest, two to three millimetres high. The nares are long, slit-like and positioned above and in front of the large skull openings, the fenestrae antorbitales, with which they are not confluent. Of the jaws, which are very straight, the front part is lacking. There are six pairs of teeth in the maxillae and three pairs in the praemaxillae. In the mandible there are at least ten pairs of teeth, perhaps twelve. The back teeth are small, the front teeth are very long, robust and curved, pointing moderately forwards. At the front they form a large, intermeshing \\"prey grab\\", that may have been used to snatch fish from the water surface. The teeth of Angustinaripterus resemble those of Dorygnathus. Peter Wellnhofer in 1991, assuming the skull length was 16.5 centimetres (6.5 inches), estimated the wingspan at 1.6 metres (5.25 ft). Classification Xinlu placed Angustinaripterus into the Rhamphorhynchidae. Because of the derived morphology and the large geographical distance with comparable European forms He also created a special subfamily Angustinaripterinae, of which Angustinaripterus itself is the only known member; because of this redundancy the concept is rarely used. He concluded that Angustinaripterus was directly related to the Scaphognathinae. David Unwin however, considers it a member of the other rhamphorhynchid subgroup: the Rhamphorhynchinae. The cladogram (family tree) of rhamphorhynchids below is the result of a large phylogenetic analysis published by Andres & Myers in 2013.

Hampson struggled with short-sightedness early in his career, and had laser eye surgery prior to the 2012 season to correct it. Hampson played 63 senior games for Carlton from 2007 until the end of the 2013 season. He was traded to Richmond in October 2013, in exchange for pick 28 in the AFL Draft. Hampson made his senior debut for Richmond in round one of the 2014 season, against the Gold Coast Suns. Hampson was affected by a back injury in 2017 and did not manage to play a match at AFL level. He also managed just six appearances with the club's reserves side in the VFL. He played in round 1 of the VFL season in 2018 but did not play another match after that due to a re- occurrence of the same back issues. Hampson announced his immediate retirement from AFL football on 26 June 2018, citing the ongoing effects of his two-year back troubles.

The Latin specific epithet lucidum means \\"bright\\" or \\"shiny\\", referring to the leaves. Description Ligustrum lucidum is an evergreen tree growing to tall and broad. The leaves are opposite, glossy dark green, long and broad. The flowers are similar to other privets, white or near white, borne in panicles, and have a strong fragrance, which some people find unpleasant. Ligustrum lucidum and the variegated cultivar 'Excelsum Superbum' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Uses Ligustrum lucidum is often used as an ornamental tree, sometimes in variegated forms. It is also one of several species of privet used as dense, evergreen hedges, which can be trained to a specific size and shape by regular pruning. It has become an invasive species in some areas where it has been introduced, such as urban areas in the southeastern United States. It is classed as a noxious weed in New South Wales, Australia, and is similarly listed in New Zealand's National Pest Plant Accord. Ethnomedical uses The seeds are known as nu zhen zi (female chastity seed/berry) in traditional Chinese medicine and are believed to nourish liver and kidney yin and jing in the treatment of tinnitus (ringing in the ears), vertigo (dizziness), premature graying of the hair, and soreness/weakness of the lower back and knees. Due to the belief in the berries' ability to nourish the liver, they are also used in the treatment of disorders of the eye involving red or dry eyes, blurred vision, and pain.

After going through all of their junior squads, he broke into the first-team squad for the first time in the 1997‚Äì98 season sitting on the bench as a substitute goalkeeper for several matches. His first-team debut on the pitch, however, did not come until four seasons later. Before that he had served as a first-choice keeper for Rostock's reserve team and a third-string goalkeeper for the Bundesliga squad. In March 2002 Klewer played his first Bundesliga game after the first and second-choice keepers were out with injury and suspension respectively. Klewer stayed first-choice for the remaining eight games of the 2001‚Äì02 season, which saw Rostock stave off relegation. At the beginning of the following season Klewer stepped back behind regular first-choice keeper Matthias Schober but advanced to a second- string position. He only saw action twice more in 2003‚Äì04 season before opting to leave Rostock after twenty-one years of playing for the club. He joined 1.

Are today's players out of stroke when it comes to 14.1?\\", by Bob Jewett. Billiards Digest magazine. July 2000, pages 22-24. Early life Crane's fascination with billiards started at age 11, sparked by play on a toy pool table his brother received as a Christmas gift. When he showed interest and ability, his father Scott Crane, a trial lawyer and sportsman, and his mother, a high school teacher, soon replaced their dining room table with a 4' by 8' pool table. He soon ventured out of the home to practice a couple days each week at Olympic Billiards, a room that was part of a bowling alley in Scottsville, a suburb of Rochester, New York.\\"The Last of a Rare Breed\\", by T.S. O'Connell, page 29, Snap Magazine. Retrieved August 4, 2007 Crane stated in 1998: \\"Other kids, you know they'd play for twenty minutes or half an hour and they'd say, 'let's do something else.' I could play all day and never get enough. I couldn't wait to get home from school to play.\\" Crane's status as a wunderkind was quickly evident; although he was entirely self-taught, at 14 he ran 89 balls in straight pool at a local pool room, calling each shot in advance, as is mandatory in straight pool. Following this feat, his parents replaced the smaller table with a full size tournament table. Over the next ten years some of the best players of the era, including Willie Hoppe and Andrew Ponzi, came to practice with the promising champion. Despite consistent play throughout his teenage years, Crane did not enter any tournaments until he was 23 years old. In February 1939, at age 26, Crane 150 balls against his opponent in an exhibition straight pool match on a difficult 5' by 10' table in Layton, Utah. While this was impressive in and of itself, at the crowd's urging, he continued his run, ultimately pocketing 309 consecutive balls thus shattering the previous world record of 244 consecutive balls.R.S.B.

World titles This coup was soon followed by his first world title in 1942. Over the following three decades, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. Of these triumphs, his win at the 1966 World Crown is the most celebrated. At that tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals, never letting his opponent back to the table after an early safety battle; an accomplishment that has never been equaled. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13. Despite his mastery and world renown, Crane found it hard to make a living solely playing pool, and in 1957 began working as a Cadillac salesman at Valley Cadillac Inc. 333 East Avenue in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. According to Crane's daughter, at Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit featured a pool table at which Crane would run balls while answering questions. \\"Working\\" for a living was purely a choice of survival. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, Crane said, \\"If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool...

Billiards Digest magazine. October 1999, page 60. Crane earned the appellation \\"the Deacon\\" because of his gentlemanly ways, his very cautious approach to the game and his impeccable dress, never approaching a pool table except in a conservative suit. Los Angeles Times sports columnist Jim Murray once said Crane \\"would make Henry Fonda look furtive.\\" Highlighting Crane's both cautious approach and mastery, Mike Sigel, one of pool's most illustrious players, reportedly asked Crane to play one day when Sigel was a young player.

Beaconsfield Upper recorded a population of 2,861 at the 2016 Census. History Squatters grazed sheep and cattle in Berwick Shire from the 1830s but there was little interest in the difficult terrain and poor soils in the hills.In the Wake of the Pack Tracks The discovery of gold in 1872 led to the application of Section 49 of the Land Act to the area, which provided attractive terms to small selectors. An early pioneer, William Brisbane, named his guesthouse \\"Beaconsfield House\\" after the then British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (Lord Beaconsfield). When \\"Beaconsfield\\" Post Office opened on 7 October 1878, Brisbane was the first postmaster. The Melbourne to Sale Railway line opened in 1879 and later that year, a platform built at the Cardinia Creek crossing was named Beaconsfield. The Beaconsfield Post office was renamed Beaconsfield Upper in 1891. Early settlers tended to be small mixed farmers or Melbournites with weekenders. By 1912, there was a school, a hall, a general store and post office plus six guesthouses and the Pinegrove Hotel. In February 1983, the Ash Wednesday fires swept through the area destroying many houses and claiming lives. Today The town can be referred to colloquially as Upper Beac and Upper Beacy. A community newsletter, the Village Bell, is published quarterly by the Upper Beaconsfield Association. Sport and leisure facilities include a busy community centre, recreation reserve for cricket, football and scouting groups, a pony and riding club, tennis club and a number of parks and reserves. Golfers play at the Beaconhills Country Club on Stoney Creek Road. Community organisations include 3 and 4 year old kindergartens, primary school, St John's Anglican church, hall and meeting room, a nursing home, CFA, and a men's shed.

It is in the parish of Burnham Norton and is accessed by a seasonal ferry from the village of Overy Staithe. The shingle and sand island appears to have originated from a former spit extending from the coast, and longshore drift means that it is slowly moving to the west and inshore. The island comprises sand dunes, salt marsh, intertidal sand and mud flats, and shingle. It supports internationally important numbers of breeding Sandwich and little terns, and nationally significant populations of common and Arctic terns, as well as wintering waders and wildfowl. It has a number of uncommon plants adapted to its harsh environments. It was bought by the National Trust in 1923, and became a national nature reserve. It was subsumed into the North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The first resident first \\"watcher\\" (warden) on Scolt Head was pioneering ornithologist and photographer Emma Turner. This isolated island has been largely undisturbed by human activity apart from service as an artillery range in World War II, and it is of international importance because of the extensive research into its geomorphology over nearly a century. Description Scolt Head Island is a roughly 6.5 km (4 mi) long shingle and sand island on the Norfolk coast opposite Burnham Norton. Despite its name, it is possible to walk across the mudflats and Norton Creek to the island at low tide. However this route is potentially dangerous due to shifting and deep mud and rapid tidal changes, and is not recommended by the landowner. Its main beach and ridge of sand dunes run approximately east to west, and it has a series of curved shingle \\"hooks\\" running south and east on its landward side. The 737 ha (1820 acres) island is composed almost entirely flint pebbles, mostly rounded by wave action, and sand; other minerals make up less than one per cent of the material. It is gradually extending westwards due to wave action and longshore drift. The curved shingle ridges were formed when each in turn was formerly the western end of the island, and salt marshes have developed between each ridge. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter.Steers, J A in Allison & Morley (1986) p. 19. Natural England's designation document states that the shingle spits here and at Blakeney Point are of special importance for the study of geophysical processes, and are the best studied and documented in the world. The salt marsh and shingle structures together are of the highest national importance for investigating the recent geological history of this coast. The salt marshes here develop rapidly due to the inflow of silt and increasing plant growth, increasing in height by about 1 cm (0.4 in) annually,Chorley et al (1984) p. 407. and developing a well-defined creek system as they age.Allen & Pye (1992) p. 158. The island is served by a ferry from Burnham Overy Staithe which runs from April to September, and there is a 1 km (1,100 yd) nature trail with information boards. History Norfolk has a long history of human occupation dating back to the Palaeolithic, and including significant archaeology. Both modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, before the last glaciation, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic (10,000‚Äì5,000 BCE), the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as Doggerland. Retrieved 18 September 2012.Robertson et al (2005) pp. 9‚Äì22. Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic long blades up to Murphy (2009) p. 14. long found on the present-day coast at nearby Titchwell Marsh date from a time when it was from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic (50,000‚Äì10,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (5,000‚Äì2,500 BCE). Deposits of peat between layers of marine or salt marsh sediments date from 1980‚Äì1780 BC, indicating that the sea had retreated, leaving this area as dry land during that era.Robertson et al (2005) p. 152. Signs of human use of the island range from early medieval Grimston ware pottery to post-World War II building foundations, and wooden structures in the marshes include posts set for mussel farming, and a wooden structure that was probably a fish trap thumb It was originally thought that the island, believed to be 2‚Äì3 thousand years old, developed from an offshore shingle ridge, and had thus always been an island, but current thinking is that the island was originally a spit extending west from Holkham dunes. Support for this theory comes from boreholes and from radiocarbon dating of a shell to 837AD, that appeared to indicate the existence of saltmarshes behind the shingle barrier at that time. A 1585 map also appears to show a spit at this location,Shennan (2000) p. 245. and a 1630 inventory of the lands of Robert of Brancaster, the local Lord of the Manor, did not show list the island as a separate entity. On the death of Simms Reeve, Lord of Brancaster, in 1922, earlier disputes over the ownership of the island were resolved with his executors retaining the southern part, and the Earl of Orford the northern section. The island was bought by the Earl of Leicester in 1922. He sold most of the island to the National Trust in 1923 for ¬£500 to manage as a nature reserve, retaining only a small area at the eastern end. The first resident first \\"watcher\\" (warden) on Scolt Head was Emma Turner, who served for eighteen months in 1923‚Äì1924.Haines (2001) p. 310. In 1944, Lord Leicester was asked if he would remove five huts on his part of the island, together with others on the coast opposite. He agreed to do so if the Norfolk Naturalists' Trust (NNT) would take over his part of the island. The island was used as an artillery range during World War II, but the NNT purchase took place in 1945.Steers (1971) p. 1. The SS Vina, an 1894 cargo steamer, was anchored near the west end of the island in 1944 for use as an RAF target where the wreck can still be seen at low tide. The remains of a Blenheim bomber were found at the north of the island in 2004. A steel wreck or hulk measuring around 72m long and 15m wide was also brought to the island during World War II for military target practice.Robertson et al (2005) p 69. The Nature Conservancy Council took over responsibility for Scolt Head Island's management in 1953 on a 99-year lease,Rodgers et al (2010 ) p.167‚Äì168 and it became a national nature reserve in 1967,Allen & Pye (1992) p. 148. It was subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI in 1986. The larger area is now additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA) and Ramsar listings, and is part of the Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Retrieved 8 November 2011.  Fauna and flora  Birds Internationally important numbers of Sandwich and little terns breed on the island, together with common and Arctic terns The marshes also support wintering wildfowl and waders, including shelduck, wigeon, teal and curlew. brent geese feed on sea lettuce and eelgrass, preferring the former when both are available. The average number of pink-footed geese in the five winters to 2009/10 was 22,764, far exceeding the international importance level of 2,700 birds.Holt et al (2011) p. 31‚Äì32. The island's location means that migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions are right.Elkins (1988) pp. 136‚Äì137.Newton (2010) pp. 97‚Äì98. These may include vagrant rarities,Newton (2010) p. 50. such as an isabelline shrike in 2003, a white-billed diver in 2002, and a dusky warbler in 2000.  Other animals and plants  Marram grass-covered dunes The rabbit population reached eight to ten thousand individuals before the arrival of myxomatosis in 1954 killed all but 12 animals, although numbers increased afterwards. Further outbreaks of the disease have led to fluctuating numbers of rabbits on the island. Other resident mammals include stoats, common shrews, pygmy shrews, wood mice and short-tailed voles. Three species of deer have travelled over the marshes to reach the island.Foster, W A in Allison & Morley (1986) pp. 85-86. Insects include the intertidal ground beetle Dicheirotrichus gustavi which emerges from cracks or holes to feed on the salt marshes after dusk. Despite living in a coastal environment, it has no cycle of behaviour linked to the tides, simply scurrying for dry land when caught by the approaching sea. Another intertidal beetle, Bledius spectabilis, shows very unusual behaviour for an insect in that it actively protects its larvae from the parasitic wasp Barycnemis blediator and from the predatory Dicheirotrichus gustavi. The saltmarsh and the dunes both hold a notably wide range of plants, including a number of uncommon species. The saltmarsh contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The shingle ridges attract biting stonecrop, sea campion, yellow horned poppy, sea thrift, bird's foot trefoil and sea beet. sea wormwood, sea lavender and scrubby sea- blite also thrive, matted sea lavender and sea heath are international important species found in this habitat. The sand dunes are initially stabilised by marram grass and sea couch grass, enabling colonisation by sea poa grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and grey hair-grass, which also help to bind the sand. Sea holly, sand sedge, bird‚Äôs-foot trefoil and pyramidal orchid are other specialists of this arid habitat.  Recreation  Birdwatchers in 1961 Outdoor recreation is important to the economy of north Norfolk, and a 2005 survey at six coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent ¬£122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs.Liley (2008) pp. 4‚Äì6. The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.Liley (2008) pp. 10‚Äì14. The limited access to the island means that it is not subjected to the pressures of heavy or uncontrolled visitor access. The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes. Similar dune systems at Blakeney Point, Holme and Holkham are considered to be sensitive habitats already suffering from visitor pressure, and therefore designated as a red-zone area with no development or parking improvements to be recommended, but Scolt is placed in the orange zone, for locations with fragile habitats but less tourism pressure.Scott Wilson Ltd (2006) pp. 5‚Äì6. Threats Storms in 1931-33 swept away 250 m (250 yd) of the island, and the island was breached in a large storm in 1938 and by the North Sea flood of January 1953, in each case washing the shingle through to the marshes beyond. A wire and brushwood fence erected in the spring of 1953 trapped sand and allowed the breach to heal by August of the same year.Packham & Willis (1997) p. 241  References   Secondary sources         * External links * English Nature NNR page * Brancaster Staithe and Burnham Deepdale - Guide to these two villages and the north Norfolk coast Category:Coastal features of Norfolk Category:Nature reserves in Norfolk Category:National nature reserves in England Category:Islands of England Category:Barrier islands ","title":"Scolt Head Island"},{"id":"8112469","title":"Ana Isabel Alonso"},{"id":"8112475","text":"Bend of Islands is a rural locality in Victoria, Australia, 30 km north-east of Melbourne's Central Business District. Its local government area is the Shire of Nillumbik. At the 2016 Census, Bend of Islands had a population of 295. It is situated on about 635 hectares and is named after a group of small islands at a bend of the Yarra River near Watsons Creek. It is located near the town of Kangaroo Ground. The location was a favourite spot for local anglers in 1939. About 130 allotments range from a half to 12 hectares. Exotic animals, including cats and dogs and vegetation are banned to minimise the spread of weeds, damage to the soil and harm to native fauna. It was gazetted in 2000 after a petition from local residents, having previously been part of Christmas Hills and Kangaroo Ground. Jessie and Edward Haughton built Three Bears Cottage which is considered significant as the last built connection with the regionally significant family who were instrumental in shaping the local landscape and subsequent bush lifestyle from the 1930s. The Haughton's used to have swimming parties in the swimming pool on the bend in the river. Other significant residents of Bend of Islands in the 1970s included Neil Douglas and Helen (Abbie) Heathcote whose house at 512 Henley Road is included on the Victorian Heritage Database. Artist and naturalist Neil Douglas and others purchased properties following bushfires in 1962 and further established the area for residents. The Burns House, known as Kangaroo, was designed by architect and artist Peter Burns and was built in stages from 1968 on an elevated sloping bush land site. It is considered of architectural and historical significance to the State of Victoria. The area has been under threat a number of times including in 1980 when the Government of Victoria considered buying it as part of a conservation area while bulldozers began clearing natural bushland at the same time. The Bend of Islands incorporates the area of the former Environmental Living Zone, now known as Special Use Zone (SUZ) - Environmental Living in the Nillumbik Planning Scheme. The Bend of Islands Conservation Association (BICA) was formed in the 1960s. Residents Neil Douglas and Abbie Heathcote used to open their home to exhibit their art. This practice became the foundation for the Nillumbik Artists Open studios program. Local artists continue to be part of the program. The Bend of Island Community members, or 'benders', are a thriving and connected community with monthly coffee mornings at the local fire station, weekly BICA events such as bird or flora walks, and a large artistic community.

It is closely linked to the ars dictandi, covering the composition of documents other than letters. The standing assumption was that these writings would be composed in Latin, and according to well worked-out models. This made the arts of composition a subfield of rhetoric. In business letters, it called for some form of address (e.g., ‚ÄúWorshipful master‚Äù); salutation (‚ÄúI greet you well‚Äù); notification (‚ÄúMay it please you to know‚Äù); exposition (‚Äúthe wool was shipped‚Äù); disposition (‚Äúand I want my money‚Äù); and valediction (‚ÄúMay God keep you well, at least until my bill is paid‚Äù). Clerks and scribes wrote the letters based on those rules.

Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame de Montr√©al The Society of Our Lady of Montr√©al for the conversion of the Indians of New France, (sometimes known as the \\"Company Our Lady of Montreal\\") was formed in 1641 by Jean-Jacques Olier de Verneuil and J√©r√¥me Le Royer, Sieur de La Dauversi√®re with the aim of establishing a fortified city in New France in order to teach French settlers and Christian Indians. Upon the death of her husband in 1640, she inherited a large fortune, including the Ch√¢teau de Brie-Comte-Robert. In 1641, Father Charles Rapine de Boisvert, former Provincial of the Recollects, Director of Saint-Denis and a distant cousin of her husband, introduced her to Jeanne Mance, a nurse from Champagne and member of the Society of Our Lady of Montr√©al, who plans to accompany Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve to New France. and her friend Madame de Villesasin (Isabelle Blondeau) are benefactors of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Paris.

There has been a creamery in the village making Wensleydale cheese for almost 100 years, first owned by Mrs Mason, then Kit Calvert, of Hawes, subsequently the Milk Marketing Board and more recently it was acquired by the Wensleydale Creamery.Wensleydale Creamery: History and Heritage History Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the village was mentioned in Domesday Book as Chirchebi (meaning \\"church village\\"). The suffix Malzeard (another place-name, meaning \\"bad clearing\\" in Norman French) was added by the early 12th century. In medieval times the honour of Kirkby Malzeard included large areas to the west of the village in upper Nidderdale, and the parish came to include several townships: *Azerley *Fountains Earth *Grewelthorpe *Hartwith cum Winsley (a detached part) *Laverton *Stonebeck Down *Stonebeck Up The townships became separate civil parishes in the 19th century. In mediaeval times there was a castle at Kirkby Malzeard, held by the de Mowbray family. When Roger de Mowbray participated in the Revolt of 1173‚Äì74 against King Henry II, the castle was besieged by the Bishop elect of Lincoln, and Mowbray surrendered it, together with Thirsk Castle, to the King: both castles were demolished. Note: Sheahan says the siege was in 1175, and the besieger was \\"Henry, the Elect Bishop of Lincoln\\". Other sources such as say that this campaign was in 1174, and the Bishop elect of Lincoln was Geoffrey Plantagenet, illegitimate son of Henry II. In 1307, King Edward I granted Kirkby Malzeard the right to hold two fairs annually, and a weekly market on Wednesday. These were subsequently abandoned, but revived in 1816. In 1871 the fairs were still held (on Whit Monday and 2 October), but the market had lapsed again. In 1866 a landowner named Joseph Helliwell demolished the Market Cross. There was an outcry, and after a year of litigation, Helliwell was compelled to remove a cottage and part of his house that were encroaching on the Market Place. A new Market Cross was erected by public subscription, inaugurated on 30 September 1868. Several newspapers and documents relating to the market place and the cross were placed in a sealed bottle when the foundations were laid. The writer and historian William Grainge was born to a farming family in the village.North Yorkshire County Council website The Queens Head in 2008 Amenities The Highside Playing Fields, which provide facilities for several sports, were created in the 1970s. One of the benefactors was Bing Crosby, who came shooting in the area in 1975. He donated ¬£1,250 towards the playing fields, and visited them during a cricket match in 1976. There is a convenience store and a butcher in Kirkby Malzeard, as well as one pub, the Queens Head.

On 23 May 2002 the new building of the National Bank of Slovakia's headquarters was ceremonially opened. It is located in Bratislava I District ‚Äì the Old Town, in the area defined by the Streets M√Ωtna, Vazovova, Slovansk√° and Imrich Karva≈° Street (former Starohorsk√°). Through its spacious, and in particular its technical facilities, it creates optimal conditions for NBS employees to perform all the central-bank functions. Urban and architectural solution of the construction arose from a public tender, which received 24 competitive proposals. A jury comprising 21 renowned specialists from the field of architecture, construction and specialists from the banking sphere and the NBS chose as the winning architectural proposal that of the designers Ing. arch. Martin Kus√Ω and Ing. arch. Pavol Pa≈à√°k. The winning project began to be realised in November 1996. The architectural and construction solution for the building is purpose oriented, pleasing to the eye and efficient. It fulfils the most modern technical and environmental criteria as well as the highest demands for the economical operation of the building and quality of the work environment. The basic architectural concept in the composition of the new NBS building is the contrast of its strong horizontal base and out of this a growing tower. The lower horizontal part of the building forms the premises for the fulfilment of the central bank's operational functions resulting from the Act of the National Council of the Slovak Republic no. 566/1992 as amended. There is also a congress hall and exhibition premises. In terms of space this part of the building is composed around an attractive central yard with a raised green area. In the tower part are administrative offices. A significant component of the architectural and spatial concept of the new building is this green as an integral component of the selected premises. The design was realised exclusively by Slovak companies. The construction was carried out by the Association H ‚Äì V ‚Äì Z (Hydrostav, a.s., Bratislava, V√°hostav, a.s., ≈Ωilina, ZIPP, s.r.o., Bratislava). Engineering activity was provided by the Association of Engineering (Keramoprojekt, a.s., Trenƒç√≠n, Keraming, v.o.s., Trenƒç√≠n, Chempik, a.s., Bratislava). The new building of the National Bank of Slovakia headquarters is in Slovak conditions both an unusual and demanding construction, not only in terms of its height, imposing architectural solution, but also in terms of the demands on the material provision, technological construction procedures, coordination of all sub-suppliers in the period of its construction and finishing. The new NBS building may also be considered from the aspect of its architectural and urban solution as a gain for the central zone of the capital, located in proximity to the central bodies of the Slovak Republic.

It works by relaxing the muscles in and around the gut. Medical use Mebeverine is used to alleviate some of the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and related conditions; specifically stomach pain and cramps, persistent diarrhea, and flatulence. Data from controlled clinical trials have not found a difference from placebo or statistically significant results in the global improvement of IBS. It has not been tested in pregnant women nor in pregnant animals so pregnant women should not take it; it is expressed at low levels in breast milk, while no adverse effects have been reported in infants, breastfeeding women should not take this drug. Adverse effects Adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions and allergic reactions, immune system disorders, skin disorders including hives, edema and widespread rashes. Additionally, the following adverse effects have been reported: heartburn, indigestion, tiredness, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, general malaise, dizziness, insomnia, headache, and decreased pulse rate. It does not have systemic anticholinergic side effects. Mebeverine can, on highly rare occasions, cause drug-induced acute angle closure glaucoma. Mechanism of action Mebeverine is an anticholinergic but its mechanism of action is not known; it appears to work directly on smooth muscle within the gastrointestinal tract and may have an anesthetic effect, may affect calcium channels, and may affect muscarinic receptors. It is metabolized mostly by esterases, and almost completely. The metabolites are excreted in urine. Mebeverine exists in two enantiomeric forms. The commercially available product is a racemic mixture of them. A study in rats indicates that the two have different pharmacokinetic profiles. History It is a second generation papaverine analog, and was first synthesized around the same time as verapamil. It was first registered in 1965.

If the sugar contains a ketone group, it is a ketose. If a sugar contains an aldehyde group, it is an aldose. This test relies on the principle that, when heated, ketoses are more rapidly dehydrated than aldoses. It is named after Theodor Seliwanoff, the chemist that devised the test. When added to a solution containing ketoses, a red color is formed rapidly indicating a positive test. When added to a solution containing aldoses, a slower forming light pink is observed instead. Seliwanoff-Reaction The reagents consist of resorcinol and concentrated hydrochloric acid: * The acid hydrolysis of polysaccharide and oligosaccharide ketoses yields simpler sugars followed by furfural.Abramoff, Peter; Thomson, Robert (1966). An experimental approach to biology. WH Freeman & Company, San Francisco. p. 47. * The dehydrated ketose then reacts with two equivalents of resorcinol in a series of condensation reactions to produce a molecule with a deep cherry red color. * Aldoses may react slightly to produce a faint pink color. Fructose and sucrose are two common sugars which give a positive test. Sucrose gives a positive test as it is a disaccharide consisting of fructose and glucose. Generally, 6M HCl is used to run this test. Ketose get dehydrated faster and hence they give the test faster. Aldoses react very slowly and give faint colors.

Biography Cardinal Innocenti's grave in Tosi. He was born at Poppi, Italy. Ordained in 1938 at Florence, Innocenti was studied at the Episcopal Seminary of Fiesole, the Pontifical Gregorian University where he received a doctorate in 1941, the Pontifical Lateran University, where he received a licentiate in dogmatic theology in 1950, and the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, where he studied diplomacy. He served as a priest in northern Italy for the decade following his ordination. His work helping Jews led to his arrest and almost being shot by a firing squad; he was released at the last minute. He was then called to Rome by Pope Pius XII and settled on a career in the Curia. He served for most of the 1950s and 1960s in the Papal Nunciature in Switzerland, where, as he saw it, the major problems were \\"an opulent society, religious assistance to immigrants and relations with Christian of other denominations\\". On 15 December 1967, Pope Paul VI named him Titular Archbishop of Eclano and Apostolic Nuncio to Paraguay. He was appointed Secretary of the Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments (now the Congregation for Divine Worship) until 1980, when he became Nuncio to Spain. In 1985, Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal, and on 9 January 1986 appointed him Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, a post he held until his retirement in 1991 During Innocenti's time as Prefect, the Curia was extremely busy dealing with what was perceived as dangerous dissent from papal teaching, and Innocenti was heavily involved with many lay movements designed to restore orthodoxy among the Church's members. By 1999 he had retired to Piazza della Citta Leonina.

It is an herbaceous perennial plant growing to tall, with hairless stems and leaves. The leaves are rounded, diameter, palmately divided into five to seven deeply lobed segments. The flowers are dark purple to bluish-purple, narrow oblong helmet- shaped, tall. Plants native to Asia and North America formerly listed as A. napellus are now regarded as separate species. The plant is extremely poisonous in both ingestion and skin contact. Cultivation Aconitum napellus is grown in gardens in temperate zones for its spiky inflorescences that are showy in early-mid summer, and its attractive foliage. There are white and rose colored forms in cultivation too. The cultivar 'Spark's Variety' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Aconites have been used more recently in murder plots; they contain the chemical alkaloids aconitine, mesaconitine, hypaconitine and jesaconitine, which are highly toxic.CSA It was also used in a recent Sherlock Holmes book plot.Gary Lovisi and Marvin Kaye Toxicology Marked symptoms may appear almost immediately, usually not later than one hour, and \\"with large doses, death is almost instantaneous\\".R.D. Mann Death usually occurs within two to six hours in fatal poisoning (20 to 40 mL of tincture may prove fatal).The Extra Pharmacopoeia Martindale. Vol. 1, 24th edition. London: The Pharmaceutical Press, 1958, page 38. The initial signs are gastrointestinal including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This is followed by a sensation of burning, tingling, and numbness in the mouth and face, and of burning in the abdomen. In severe poisonings pronounced motor weakness occurs and cutaneous sensations of tingling and numbness spread to the limbs. Cardiovascular features include hypotension, sinus bradycardia, and ventricular arrhythmias. Other features may include sweating, dizziness, difficulty in breathing, headache, and confusion. The main causes of death are ventricular arrhythmias and asystole, paralysis of the heart or of the respiratory center. The only post-mortem signs are those of asphyxia. Treatment of poisoning is mainly supportive. All patients require close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiac rhythm. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal can be used if given within one hour of ingestion. The major physiological antidote is atropine, which is used to treat bradycardia. Other drugs used for ventricular arrhythmia include lidocaine, amiodarone, bretylium, flecainide, procainamide, and mexiletine. Cardiopulmonary bypass is used if symptoms are refractory to treatment with these drugs. Successful use of charcoal hemoperfusion has been claimed in patients with severe aconite poisoning. Poisoning may also occur following picking the leaves without wearing gloves; the aconitine toxin is absorbed easily through the skin. In this event, there will be no gastrointestinal effects. Tingling will start at the point of absorption and extend up the arm to the shoulder, after which the heart will start to be affected. The tingling will be followed by unpleasant numbness. Treatment is similar to poisoning caused by oral ingestion and even handling the plant without gloves has been reported to result in multi-organ failure and death. 'Aconitine' is a potent neurotoxin that opens tetrodotoxin sensitive sodium channels. It increases influx of sodium through these channels and delays repolarization, thus increasing excitability and promoting ventricular dysrhythmias.

Accessed 27 November 2008.) In 2010 the baths closed for a major refurbishment, re- opening in mid-2012 after a two year re-build.  History  The Tepid Baths was originally leased from the Auckland Harbour Board, and contain two separate pools, a \\"male\\" (25 m, 6 lanes) and \\"female\\" (18 m, 4 lane). The \\"male\\" pool was the largest in New Zealand at the time. The pools were heated with hot water from the nearby tramways power plant, the system being considered an engineering masterpiece of its time.Welcome to Tepid Baths (from the YMCA Auckland website) The pools were not only extensively used for both recreational and competitive swimming, but also for some other activities ‚Äì in one event in the early 1930s, a pentecostal minister baptised a hundred new faithful in the pools.Dallimore, Arthur Henry (database entry in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography) Two local athletes were employed as custodians of the baths, swimmer Malcolm Champion (who frequently swam across the harbour to and from his North Shore home) and runner Billy Savidan. In 1974, the salt water pools (previously fed from the WaitematƒÅ Harbour) were transformed into fresh water pools, primarily for maintenance reasons. The facility was refurbished in 1986 and again after the YMCA received the management lease in 1997 from Auckland City Council. Renovations included new sauna and steam rooms, and a gym on the upper level (YMCA club members only). Nowadays, a large part of the Tepid Baths' customers are people working in the Auckland CBD who swim here before or after work.Swimming pool strategy (from the Auckland City Council website) Hobson Street flyover in 2016 In November 2009 it was announced that the Tepid Baths would close for a period of up to four years for a $12 million restoration project to address structural issues exacerbated by saltwater effects. It was hoped the pool would reopen in time for its 100th anniversary in 2014. The baths closed in April 2010, with the Y-Fitness Centre having already moved to a new purpose-built facility at the ANZ Centre on Albert Street. While the restoration costs rose later to approximately $16 million, the pools were closed only until mid-2012 when they reopened. In late 2012, the restored building won the New Zealand Project Management Institute's (PMINZ) Public Sector Project of the Year award.

A common defining feature is that programmes and activities are developed in dialogue with communities and participants. The purpose of community learning and development is to develop the capacity of individuals and groups of all ages through their actions, the capacity of communities, to improve their quality of life. Central to this is their ability to participate in democratic processes.Working and Learning Together to Build Stronger Communities, Scottish Government Guidance for Community Learning and Development, 2004 seen at the Community Learning and Development, Scottish Government Website. Community education encompasses all those occupations and approaches that are concerned with running education and development programmes within local communities, rather than within educational institutions such as schools, colleges and universities. The latter is known as the formal education system, whereas community education is sometimes called informal education. It has long been critical of aspects of the formal education system for failing large sections of the population in all countries and had a particular concern for taking learning and development opportunities out to poorer areas, although it can be provided more broadly. There are a myriad of job titles and employers include public authorities and voluntary or non-governmental organisations, funded by the state and by independent grant making bodies. Schools, colleges and universities may also support community learning and development through outreach work within communities. The community schools movement has been a strong proponent of this since the sixties. Some universities and colleges have run outreach adult education programmes within local communities for decades. Since the seventies the prefix word ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô has also been adopted by several other occupations from youth workers and health workers to planners and architects, who work with more disadvantaged groups and communities and have been influenced by community education and community development approaches. Community educators have over many years developed a range of skills and approaches for working within local communities and in particular with disadvantaged people. These include less formal educational methods, community organising and group work skills. Since the nineteen sixties and seventies through the various anti poverty programmes in both developed and developing countries, practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses as to the causes of disadvantage and poverty i.e. inequalities in the distribution of wealth, income, land etc. and especially political power and the need to mobilise people power to effect social change. Thus the influence of such educators as Paulo Friere and his focus upon this work also being about politicising the poor. In the history of community education and community learning and development, the UK has played a significant role in hosting the two main international bodies representing community education and community development. These being the International Community Education Association, which was for many years based at the Community Education Development Centre based in Coventry UK. ICEA and CEDC have now closed, and the International Association for Community Development, which still has its HQ in Scotland. In the 1990s there was some thought as to whether these two bodies might merge. The term community learning and development has not taken off widely in other countries. Although community learning and development approaches are recognised internationally. These methods and approaches have been acknowledged as significant for local social, economic, cultural, environmental and political development by such organisations as the UN, WHO, OECD, World Bank, Council of Europe and EU. In the UK In the UK, the term community learning and development has now been widely adopted as describing a discrete employment sector of occupations concerned with outreach education and development work in local communities. In 1999, a UK-wide organisation responsible for setting professional training standards for education and development practitioners working within local communities was established. This organisation was called PAULO ‚Äì the National Training Organisation for Community Learning and Development. (It was named after Paulo Freire.) It was formally recognised by David Blunket, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment in the New Labour Government in January 1999. It brought together a range of occupational interests under a single national training standards body, these being, adult education, youth work, community development and development education. The inclusion of community development was significant as it was initially uncertain as to whether it would join the NTO for Social Care. The Community Learning and Development NTO represented all the main employers, trades unions, professional associations and national development agencies working in this area across the four nations of the UK. This was the first time that the informal education occupations across the UK had ever come together with the common purpose of creating a publicly recognised occupational sector, in the way that school teachers or college lecturers had long been publicly and officially recognised. The term 'community learning and development' was adopted to acknowledge that all of these occupations worked primarily within local communities, and that this work encompassed not just providing less formal learning support but also a concern for the wider holistic development of those communities ‚Äì socio-economically, environmentally, culturally and politically. In effect this brought together for the first time two traditions. The former group of occupations ‚Äì adult educators, youth workers and community education workers had tended to focus upon the provision of informal education support for individuals and groups within communities. They had always seen their work as being educational. The latter group ‚Äì community workers, community development workers and development educators had tended to focus upon the socio-economic and environmental development of those communities. Both sets of occupations recognised that they shared very similar values, knowledge base and skill sets and that what brought them together was a common commitment to supporting learning and social action. By bringing together these occupational groups this created for the first time a single recognised employment sector of nearly 300,000 full and part-time paid staff within the UK, approximately 10% of these staff being full-time. The NTO continued to recognise the range of different occupations within it, for example specialists who work primarily with young people, but all agreed that they shared a core set of professional approaches to their work. In 2002 the New Labour Government announced that it wished to cluster NTOs, of which there were over 50 covering a wide range of occupations across the UK labour market, under a smaller number of what they called Sector Skills Councils. A Sector Skills Council was formed called the Lifelong Learning UK Sector Skills Council. PAULO became one of five discrete pillars within LLUK, the others being the former NTOs for Further Education, for Universities, for Library and information Services and for Work Based Education. Over nearly a decade LLUK did a large amount of labour market mapping, as well as setting standards for the professional training of people working in the CLD area and generally promoted the identity of this sector across wider UK public policies and the public, non governmental and private sector employers. All Sector Skills Councils in the UK including LLUK were abolished by the Conservative/Liberal coalition Government in 2011 and at the time of writing it is uncertain as to whether a single body representing the professional community learning and development sector will be sustained. The Community and Youth Workers Union which is part of the Unite Union in the UK played the lead role in improving employee‚Äôs conditions across the sector but never succeeded in representing all employees within the CLD sector and is not widely represented across all parts of the UK. The Scottish Government has continued to recognise community learning and development as a discrete employment sector, and has for over a decade supported CLD training for people wishing to work professionally in this area. There is a team of HMI (Her Majesties Inspectors) to inspect the quality of delivery by employers. In 2007 the Scottish Government established a Scottish Standards Council for Community Learning and Development. This organisation oversees quality standards in the professional training of staff working in this field, including the validation and endorsement of professional training courses and is introducing a professional registration scheme for such qualified practitioners. It has continued much of the work of the former LLUK as it operated in Scotland. At the present time similar CLD Standards Councils have not been set up in other parts of the UK and it does appear that the sector outside Scotland is once again becoming more fragmented. Unlike the formal education sector there is virtually no legislation in the UK underpinning the need to provide and fund community learning and development. Consequently, it has been vulnerable to cuts in public expenditure due to the recession, particularly projects that were seen as too radical.  National priorities  Three national priorities have been developed for community learning and development in Scotland: ;Achievement through learning for adults Raising standards of achievement in learning for adults through community-based lifelong learning opportunities incorporating the core skills of literacy, numeracy, communications, working with others, problem solving and information communications technology (ICT). ;Achievement through learning for young people Engaging with young people to facilitate their personal, social and educational development and enable them to gain a voice, influence and place in society. ;Achievement through building community capacity Building community capacity and influence by enabling people to develop the confidence, understanding and skills required to influence decision making and service delivery.  Principles and competences  Competent CLD workers will ensure that their work supports social change and social justice and is based on the values of CLD. Their approach is collaborative, anti-discriminatory and equalities-focused and they work with diverse individuals, communities of place or interest when this is or is not appropriate. Central to their practice is challenging discrimination and its consequences and working with individuals and communities to shape learning and development activities that enhance quality of life and sphere of influence. They have good interpersonal and listening skills and their practice demonstrates that they value and respect the knowledge, experience and aspirations of those involved.The Competences for Community Learning & Development, 2009 seen at , CLD Standards Council Website. The Scottish Government have introduced the following set of principles of which community learning and development related activities should be based on: # Empowerment ‚Äì increasing the ability of individuals and groups to influence issues that affect them and their communities; # Participation ‚Äì supporting people to take part in decision making; # Inclusion, equality of opportunity and anti- discrimination ‚Äì recognising that some people may need additional support to overcome the barriers they face; # Self-determination ‚Äì supporting the right of people to make their own choices; and #Partnership ‚Äì recognising that many agencies can contribute to CLD to ensure resources are used effectively.  Wisconsin Model  A philosophical base for developing Community Education programs is provided through the five components of the Wisconsin Model of Community Education. The model provides a process framework for local school districts to implement or strengthen community education.Wisconsin's Components of Community Education , Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction A set of Community Education Principles was developed by Larry Horyna and Larry Decker for the National Coalition for Community Education in 1991 Community Education Principles , Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction These include: # Self-determination: Local people are in the best position to identify community needs and wants. Parents, as children's first and most important teachers, have both a right and a responsibility to be involved in their children's education. # Self-help: People are best served when their capacity to help themselves is encouraged and enhanced. When people assume ever-increasing responsibility for their own well being, they acquire independence rather than dependence. # Leadership Development: The identification, development, and use of the leadership capacities of local citizens are prerequisites for ongoing self-help and community improvement efforts. # Localization: Services, programs, events, and other community involvement opportunities that are brought closest to where people live have the greatest potential for a high level of public participation. Whenever possible, these activities should be decentralized to locations of easy public access. # Integrated Delivery of Services: Organizations and agencies that operate for the public good can use their limited resources, meet their own goals, and better serve the public by establishing close working relationships with other organizations and agencies with related purposes. # Maximum Use of Resources: The physical, financial, and human resources of every community should be interconnected and used to their fullest if the diverse needs and interests of the community are to be met. # Inclusiveness: The segregation or isolation of people by age, income, sex, race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors inhibits the full development of the community. Community programs, activities, and services, should involve the broadest possible cross section of community residents. # Responsiveness: Public institutions have a responsibility to develop programs and services that respond to the continually changing needs and interests of their constituents. # Lifelong Learning: Learning begins at our birth and continues until death. Formal and informal learning opportunities should be available to residents of all ages in a wide variety of community settings. Role of the professional The role of a community learning and development professional depends somewhat on the career path followed. For example, someone working with young people may have different priorities than someone working with adults; however, the outcomes are very similar in a sense that both will be aiming to promote a more socially just and equal society. Community learning and development is a vast field of work and the range of job categories is wide and may include the following: Youth Information Worker, Detached Youth Worker, Community Arts Worker, Community Capacity Worker, Local Authority Community Planning Officer, etc. Community learning and development workers should see themselves as working with people, rather than for them. Empathy is crucial to understanding the issues faced by those they work with and it is important that they engage in a way that does not intimidate people or place the worker in a position of looking down on those they work with. The role of a Community learning and development worker is largely different from the role of a formal educator such as a teacher. Community learning and development workers do not follow a curriculum, as they allow the people they work with to form their own way of learning and each individual is believed to have the ability to reach their full potential in life. A community learning and development approach is arguably a more effective way of learning as every individual has their own unique way to learn and community learning and development workers look for the best possible method that suits the individual. Community learning and development approaches are gradually being adopted in schools to some extent and many other agencies and using a community learning and development approach in their work. In Canada, a university in Alberta has created a Community-based Bachelor of Education program to prepare teachers for rural community education, making it the first university program in Canada that aims at preparing teachers for rural community education.  Qualifications  Professional community educators or community learning and development workers usually hold a professional degree in community education or community learning and development, depending on the course offered at the university from which they graduate. In Scotland, qualifications may be Approved by the Standards Council for Community Learning and Development. This means that the course has been assessed by a group of peers - an Approval Panel. The course must have a practice element totalling 40% of the course to gain Approval. More details on the Approval Process and a list of Approved qualifications are available on the Standards Council website www.cldstandardscouncil.org.uk In order to gain entrance to this course, a history of voluntary work is usually desirable. Many of those working in the field of community learning and development will be doing so voluntarily. These people are usually encouraged to complete a work-place based alternative to the full-time degree course. Others in paid positions may hold qualifications relevant to the field. These people will also be encouraged to study for a degree in community education. Some university institutions offer post-graduate degrees in community education such as MA, MSc, PGDip, PGCert, etc.  Participatory democracy  Youth participation In countries where democratic governments exist, people are encouraged to vote for someone to represent them. In today's society there is a dwindling interest in politics from our younger generation and this could have a negative effect on our democracy and political system in years to come. Community learning and development has the potential to encourage young people to become more interested in politics and helping them influence decisions that affect their lives. In many parts of the world, youth parliament-style organisations have been set up to allow young people to debate issues that affect them and others in their community. Young people engage with these organisations voluntarily and are sometimes elected using a democratic system of voting. Young people are at the heart of these organisations and are usually involved in the management and development. The majority of these organisations are facilitated and staffed by workers trained in community learning and development; however, staff role is mainly to facilitate and be supportive but not intrusive. These organisations allow young people to gain a voice, influence decision makers who affect their lives and provide them with a sense of self-worth and a place in society. In the United Kingdom, examples of these organisations include the United Kingdom Youth Parliament (UKYP); in Scotland, the Scottish Youth Parliament (SYP); in Wales the Children & Young People's Assembly for Wales; and in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Youth Forum. In Canada, examples include Youth Parliament of Manitoba (YPM), Saskatchewan Youth Parliament (SYP), TUXIS Parliament of Alberta (TUXIS), and British Columbia Youth Parliament (BCYP).  Parental participation  Cultural divides and deficit thinking creates mutual distrust between marginalized parents and schools which in turn creates barriers to active parental involvement of marginalized parents in the education of their children. Researches also show that parents of high socio- economic status play active and direct role in the education of their children and are more likely to influence school policies that affects their children's schooling whereas parents of low socio-economic status play indirect roles in the education of their children and are less likely to influence school policies that affects their children's schooling. The gap between parents' educational involvement among parents from higher socio-economic status and parents from lower socio-economic status results in a more personalized education that caters for the needs of children from higher socio-economic backgrounds and more alienating and generic education systems/policies for students from low socio-economic backgrounds. The following practices are necessary for parent and community participation in the education of their wards to be effective; students come to school healthy and ready to learn, parents assist schools with financial and or material support, there are frequent communications between parents and school authorities, parents have meaningful authorities in the schools and they also assist in the teaching of their children. Parents' home based educational involvement such as creating an enabling learning environment at home, helping their children with their assignments, helping their children develop cognitive skills and other school skills and motivating their children to do well in school supports student success. Researches show that multimodal and effective migrant parental involvement in the education of their children increases the test scores of such students and also shows strong student success even after academic abilities and socio-economic status are taken into consideration. School officials' racial stereotypes , class stereotypes, biases and attitudes regarding parental involvement in the education of their children hinders school officials from involving parents as partners in the education of their children. Also, bureaucracies in the public education systems hinders parents from advocating for changes that would benefit their children. Formally organized parental associations in schools that seeks to increase parental involvement, ignore the cultural and socio-economic needs of minorities, thereby contributing to the barriers of parental involvement, especially for marginalized parents. Research shows that high number of marginalized parents do not actively engage in their children's schooling. There is also a wide gap between the rhetoric of best parental involvement practices and actual parental involvement practices. Effective parental Involvement in the education of their children involves; parenting, communication, volunteering, home tutoring, involvement in decision-making, and collaboration with the community. Effective Parental Involvement treats and or makes school officials and parents partners in the education of their children.

The diocese comprises the department of Somme, of which the city of Amiens is the capital. History The diocese of Amiens was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Reims during the old regime; it was made subordinate to the diocese of Paris under the Concordat of 1801, from 1802 to 1822; and then in 1822 it became a suffragan of Reims again. Louis Duchesne denies any value to the legend of two Saints Firmin, honoured on the first and twenty-fifth of September, as the first and third Bishops of Amiens. The legend is of the 8th century and incoherent.Duchesne, Fastes III, pp. 122-124. Regardless of whether a St. Firmin, native of Pampeluna, was martyred during the Diocletianic Persecution, it is certain that the first bishop known to history is St. Eulogius, who defended the divinity of Christ in the councils held during the middle of the 4th century. Cathedral and churches The cathedral (13th century) is an admirable Gothic monument, and was made the subject of careful study by John Ruskin in his Bible of Amiens. The nave of this cathedral is considered a type of the ideal Gothic. Cathedral Chapter The Cathedral of Notre Dame d'Amiens was served by a Chapter composed of eight dignities and forty-six Canons. The dignities were: the Dean, the Provost, the Chancellor, the Archdeacon of Amiens, the Archdeacon of Ponthieu, the Cantor, the Master of the Schola, and the Penitentiary. The Dean was elected by the Chapter.Pouill√©, p. 1 (c. p. 323). In 1706 there were 9 dignities and 43 Canons: Ritzler-Sefrin, p. 81, note 1; VI, p. 79, note 1. Churches The city of Amiens also had a Collegiate Church of Saint-Firmin, whose Chapter was composed of a Dean and six prebendaries. All were elected by the Chapter and installed by the bishop. Saint-Nicolas-au-Clo√Ætre d'Amiens also had a Chapter, composed of a Dean and eight prebendaries, all elected by the Chapter and installed by the bishop. The church of St. Acheul, near Amiens, and formerly its cathedral, was, in the 19th century, the home of a major Jesuit novitiate. The beautiful churches of St. Ricquier and Corbie William W.Kibler, William W.Clark, L. Gaillard, and J.Daoust, eds. Corbie, abbaye royale (Lille: Facult√©s Catholiques, 1963). perpetuate the memory of the great Benedictine abbeys and homes of learning founded in these places in 570 and 662. In 859 the Normans invaded the valley of the Somme, and sacked the abbey of Saint- Riquier. They pillaged Amiens and held it for more than a year, until the city was ransomed by Charles the Bald.Soyez, pp. 27-28.

He was back in Rome at the beginning of the reign of Pope Paul I, who sent him as ambassador to Pipin again in the Spring of 758 (or 759); he was still at the royal court in June 761. At some point between 764 and 766 Pepin requested that Bishop George of Ostia stay in France at the royal court, and the Pope again granted his request (iam iterum concedit). On 28 June 767 the new Pope, Constantine II, was consecrated by Bishop George of Palestrina, a privilege usually reserved to the Bishop of Ostia. In 769 he was present at the Council of Rome, as the Bishop of Amiens. In 782 he was sent on a mission to Pope Hadrian by Charlemagne. He took part in the consecration of the churches at Saint-Riquier on 1 January 798. Sainte-Marthe, Gallia christiana X, p. 1157.

The city of Aversa arose in the 11th century,The name \\"Aversa\\" first appears in a document dated 2 September 1022. Kehr, p. 279. near the destroyed Atella, and became the seat of the Norman invader Rainulf, who became a vassal of Duke Sergius of Naples. The Norman Duke Robert Guiscard built a fortification which in time became an urban centre. Duke Robert, becoming a vassal of the pope and supporting him in his struggle with the Holy Roman Emperor, obtained permission from Pope Leo IX to have the extinct diocese of Atella revived at Aversa. In 1058, Count Richard of Aversa became Prince of Capua. This led to an immediate and continual confrontation between Norman Capua and Lombard Naples, both politically and ecclesiastically. The archbishops of Naples claimed metropolitan status over Aversa, with the right to consecrate its bishops and receive oaths of loyalty from them. At the same time the Princes of Capua claimed that Aversa was a new foundation, thanks to their work for the Church, and in no case did the Norman Prince intend to recognize the jurisdiction of the Lombards over his principality.Kehr, p. 280. In 1088, Pope Urban II consecrated the monk Guidmund, who had been an agent of the Holy See, as Bishop of Aversa. An immediate protest was lodged by the Archbishop of Naples through his Archdeacon, and by the Prince of Salerno and Amalfi through his legate, humbly requesting that possession of the Church of Aversa be returned to them (\\"ut sibi tandem Aversane ecclesie possessio redderetur\\"). In his reply to the Archbishop, Pope Urban stated that he had consecrated Bishop Guitmund neither out of anger or hatred, but for the sake of equity and compelled by necessity, lest the Church of Aversa lose such a man as he had appointed.Kehr, p. 282, no. 5, 6. In a letter to Bishop Guitmund, Pope Urban stated that he and his advisors and the Roman leaders had debated the issue of the possession of the Church of Aversa for some time (\\"diu causam eventilavimus\\"), the unanimous decision was that the investiture of the possession of the Church of Aversa should be returned to the Archbishop and the Prince.C. Ewald, \\"Die Papstbriefe der Brittischen Sammlung,\\" Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere deutsche Geschichtskunde V (Hannover 1879), pp. 356-357. On 24 September 1120, Bishop Robertus (attested 1118‚Äì1226) obtained from Pope Calixtus II the bull \\"Sicut ex Fratrum\\", in which the Church of Aversa was recognized as being directly subordinate (a suffragan) of the Roman See, rather than the Archdiocese of Capua or the Archdiocese of Naples. Kehr, pp. 284-285, no. 16. In a letter of reply (rescriptum) to the bishop of Aversa on 8 November 1298, Pope Innocent III remarked that the bishop and his predecessors had thus far (hactenus) been accustomed to obtain confirmation of their election and episcopal consecration from the archbishops of Naples, notwithstanding that Innocent's predecessor, Celestine III (1191‚Äì1198), had consecrated one \\"L\\" as bishop of Aversa himself \\"without prejudice to the Church of Naples\\", ordering that the new bishop should show reverence and obedience to the archbishop. If the bishop of Aversa wished to litigate the matter, the Pope would give him a hearing.J.P. Migne (ed.) Patrologiae Latinae cursus completus Tomus CCXIV (Paris 1846), p. 378. Kehr, p. 286, no. 21. On 10 May 1298, Pope Boniface VIII issued a bull, confirming the privileges granted by Pope Calixtus II to the Church of Aversa, making the diocese directly subject to the Holy See.Georges Digard, Les registres de Boniface VIII Tome II (Paris: Ernest Thorin 1890), pp. 133-134, no. 2593. Eubel I, p. 122, note 1. Cathedral and Chapter of Aversa The cathedral was begun thanks to the munificence of Duke Robert Guiscard, was carried forward and completed by his son Jordanus. It was dedicated to S. Paul of Tarsus. The high altar was dedicated by Pope Alexander IV on 3 June 1255.Kehr, p. 286. The cathedral was served and administered by a corporate body, the Chapter, which was composed of four dignities (the Dean, the Cantor, the Archdeacon, and the Subcantor) and thirty Canons. Two dignities were later added, in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent, designated the Theologus and the Penitentiarius. Pope Celestine III (1191‚Äì1198) granted the Chapter the right of electing their Dean.Kehr, p. 287, no. 4. The cathedral was one of the nine parishes inside the city, the care of which was assigned to the Canons prebendary. Attached to the cathedral were twelve beneficed clerics, whose duty it was to sing the Gregorian chant; two acolytes and six clerics for the sanctuary; and thirty chaplains. The members of the Chapter were paid out of a general fund (mensa canonicata), which was the subject of frequent complaint and litigation.Ughelli, p. 487. In 1600, it was agreed that the procurator of the Chapter would divide the income into eight portions, six of which would go to each of the six prebendary dignities. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. Bishop Pietro Orsini (1591‚Äì1598) presided over a diocesan synod at Aversa in 1594, and published its decrees. Bishop Carlo Carafa (1616‚Äì1644) held a diocesan synod on 19 June 1619, and published the decrees of the synod.Constitutiones dioecesanae synodi ab Illmo et revmo d(omi)no d(omino) Carolo Carafa, Dei et Apostolicae Sedis gratia Aversanae ecclesiae episcopus, celebratae IV Idus Iunij anno MDCXIX. Olmutz 1621. A diocesan synod was held by Bishop Innico Caracciolo (1697‚Äì1730) on 4‚Äî6 November 1702. In 1727, Cardinal Innico Caracciolo (1697‚Äì1730) issued a new set of Constitutions for the diocesan seminary of Aversa. New ecclesiastical province Following the Second Vatican Council, and in accordance with the norms laid out in the Council's decree, Christus Dominus chapter 40,Christus Dominus 40. Therefore, in order to accomplish these aims this sacred synod decrees as follows: 1) The boundaries of ecclesiastical provinces are to be submitted to an early review and the rights and privileges of metropolitans are to be defined by new and suitable norms. 2) As a general rule all dioceses and other territorial divisions that are by law equivalent to dioceses should be attached to an ecclesiastical province. Therefore dioceses which are now directly subject to the Apostolic See and which are not united to any other are either to be brought together to form a new ecclesiastical province, if that be possible, or else attached to that province which is nearer or more convenient. They are to be made subject to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the bishop, in keeping with the norms of the common law. 3) Wherever advantageous, ecclesiastical provinces should be grouped into ecclesiastical regions for the structure of which juridical provision is to be made. major changes were made in the ecclesiastical administrative structure of southern Italy. Wide consultations had taken place with the bishops and other prelates who would be affected. Action, however, was deferred, first by the death of Pope Paul VI on 6 August 1978, then the death of Pope John Paul I on 28 September 1978, and the election of Pope John Paul II on 16 October 1978. Pope John Paul II issued a decree, \\"Quamquam Ecclesia,\\" on 30 April 1979, ordering the changes. Three ecclesiastical provinces were abolished entirely: those of Conza, Capua, and Sorrento. A new ecclesiastical province was created, to be called the Regio Campana, whose Metropolitan was the Archbishop of Naples. The diocese of Aversa became a suffragan of Naples.Acta Apostolicae Sedis Vol. 71 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1979), pp. 562-563. On January 15, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Angelo Spinillo, Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Teggiano- Policastro, as Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aversa. He succeeded Archbishop-Bishop Mario Milano, whose resignation was accepted by the Pope on the grounds that he had reached the canonical age of retirement of 75. Bishops of Aversa to 1400 *Azolinus (1053‚Äì ? )Azzolino, the first bishop of Aversa, was consecrated a bishop by Pope Leo IX (1049‚Äì1054): \\"Siquidem dominus predecessor noster sancte memorie Leo papa nonus primum ibi episcopum, Azolinum videlicet, consecravit.\\" Kehr, p. 284-285, no. 16. Orabona, pp. 13, 47, 104. Gams, p. 855, assigns Azzolino the dates of c.1049‚Äì1056. The authenticity of the bull of Pope Calixtus, which is found only in a bull of Pope Boniface VIII, has been challenged: Kehr, p. 285, n. :[Guitmund I]In order to save all the references to Guitmund, scholars created a second and third Gutimund, rather than admit that some of the data were erroneous, faulty, or contradictory. Kehr, p. 282. :[Guitmund II] :... * Guitmund (1088‚Äì1094)Guimundus' election to the diocese of Rouen in 1079 was rejected by Pope Gregory VII, on the grounds that Guitmund was the son of a priest.

Ordericus Vitalis (Book IV) states that Guitmund left his monastery, with permission, and went to Pope Gregory VII, who made him a cardinal. August Pr√©vost, Ordericus' editor, states: \\"Guitmond n'a jamais √©t√© √©lev√© au cardinalat.\\" Kehr, too (p. 282) denies the cardinalate: \\"fabulose narrat Guimundum a Gregorio VII cardinalem s.

Following the death of Bishop Pietro Turrite, he was elected bishop by the cathedral Chapter. On 15 March 1308, Pope Clement issued a mandate to the Archbishop of Amalfi and the Bishop of Pozzuoli to investigate the election of Pierre de Bolonesio and his qualifications. Pierre had been elected by the cathedral Chapter, and had requested exemption from travelling to Avignon to obtain confirmation of the election from the pope. If the Archbishop and the Bishop were to find the election and the Elect to be canonical, they were to confirm him; otherwise, they were to void the election and order the Canons to conduct a new election.

It was originally formed in 1798. It is a component of the United States Army and the United States National Guard. It is managed by the Mississippi Military Department. The Mississippi Army National Guard maintains 97 armories in 93 communities. Mississippi Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army. The same ranks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Mississippi Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Mississippi. History The Mississippi Army National Guard came into existence under Winthrop Sargent, the first Governor of the Mississippi Territory, with the issuance of an order on 8 September 1798 organizing the Militia of the Territory. On 28 February 1799, Governor Sargent was able to get his legislative body together and the first law was passed for the permanent establishment of the Militia in Mississippi. This law constituted the beginning of the lineage of the 155th Infantry Regiment in Mississippi. The 155th Infantry Regiment is one of only nineteen Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812, and the only one from west of the Appalachians. Through the years the laws governing the Militia changed in various ways. Establishment of units varied from year to year, and ways of obtaining strength for the units also varied. There were periods of lack and little Militia at all. At other times the Militia forces were well organized. Although the Mississippi Militia participated in every war and fight of any consequence from the Sabine Expedition of 1806 through the Korean War in 1953, it was not until 1916 the Mississippi National Guard was called for active duty. In 1916 the War Department called three infantry battalions for service on the Mexican Border. These battalions formed the First Infantry Regiment which went on active duty on 24 June 1916. In September 1917 this unit was redesignated the 155th Infantry Regiment and served in the 39th Division in France. Also created during World War I, largely from Arkansas Army National Guard units, was the 154th Infantry Regiment, which continued its service after the war with the Mississippi Army National Guard. Again in 1940 all units of the Mississippi National Guard were inducted into Federal service. Between 1950 and 1951, 77 of 81 units were called into service during the Korean War. A total of 6,515 Mississippi Guardsmen served during this period. Around the early 1960s, the Mississippi Army National Guard had 151 units located throughout the State. 51 of these units were part of the 31st (Dixie) Division and the remainder were non-divisional units. Among units formed within the MS ARNG since World War II are the 198th Armor Regiment,Constituted 28 April 1959, organized 1 May-15 September 1959. Armor-Cavalry Regiments, Army National Guard Lineage Series the 114th Field Artillery Regiment, the 185th Aviation Regiment, and the 204th Air Defense Artillery Regiment. For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served \\"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\\", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period (this policy is due to change 1 August 2007, the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months, individual states have differing policies).

History The Roman Catholic Diocese of Benevento was, according to an 11th-century episcopal list, founded in the first century. During the persecution of Diocletian there is a reference to a person named Januarius, who together with Proculus his deacon and two laymen was imprisoned and beheaded at Pozzuoli in 305. He is said to have been the first bishop of Benevento before becoming Bishop of Naples. The See of Benevento was elevated in status to an archdiocese on 26 May 969, during a synod held at the Vatican Basilica by Pope John XIII. The promotion of the See and of Archbishop Landolfo took place in the presence of, and at the request of, the Emperor Otto I and Prince Pandulph of Benevento and Capua, and his son Landulph. The new metropolitanate had ten suffragan dioceses: Saint Agatha, Avellino, Alife, Ariana, Ascoli, Bibino (Bovinum), Larino, Quintodecimum (earlier at Aeculanum, then at Frigento), Telese, and Volturara.J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XIX (Venice: Antonio Zatta 1774), pp. 19‚Äì22. Ughelli, p. 61. Cappelletti, p. 59. The ultimate fate of some of these dioceses can be seen through the Provincial Synod of May 1698. When Bishop Francesco Scannagatta of Avellino attended the synod, he signed his name Franciscus Episcopus Abellinensis, Frequintinensis, Aquae-putridae seu Mirabellae, et Quintodecimi,Zigarelli, Giuseppe (1856).

The area of Benevento was struck by a severe earthquake on 11 October 1125, and it was followed immediately by four aftershocks. At midday on 12 October yet another severe shock hit. Nearly all the towers of the fortifications fell, as well as the walls, and the palaces and other edifices. The monastery of San Felice in the diocese of Benevento was completely destroyed. At Termoli the entire fa√ßade of the cathedral collapsed. Aftershocks continued for another fifteen days. On 5 December 1456, Campania and the former duchy of Benevento were hit with a major earthquake, with over 40,000 dead. It may have been the largest on record for all of southern Italy. It was followed by another on 30 December. Benevento was for the most part destroyed, suffering between 350 and 500 dead. Brindisi, with nearly all of its inhabitants, was destroyed. Apice, in the diocese of Benevento, was completely destroyed, as was Casalduni. Two thousand died at Ariano in the territory of Avellino, and the town was in ruins. Lacedonia was reduced to dust and abandoned completely. Sant' Agata dei Goti was assai conquassata ('practically crushed').Baratta, pp. 66‚Äì74. Bella Bona, p. 224. Synods In August 1059 Pope Nicholas II held a synod at Benevento in the church of S. Peter outside the walls.Ughelli, p. 9. Carl Joseph Hefele, Histoire des conciles (tr.

On 13 June 1061 a synod was held in the cathedral at Benevento by Archbishop Udalricus. It settled a conflict between Abbot Amico of Santa Sofia and Abbot Leone of Draconaria.C. J. Hefele, VI, p. 407. Kehr, p. 71. In 1075 another synod, held by Archbishop Milo, addressed another conflict between the monastery of Santa Sofia and the Bishop of Draconaria (which was later absorbed into the diocese of San Severo) over the issue of being subject to two bishops.Hefele, VI, p. 510. Pope Victor III held a synod at Benevento in August 1087, at which he excommunicated the antipope Wibert, excommunicated Archbishop Hugh of Lyon and Richard of Marseille, and ordered the deposition of any bishop or abbot who accepted lay investiture.Carl Joseph Hefele, Histoire des conciles (tr. Delarc) VII (Paris: Adrien Leclere 1872), pp. 5‚Äì6. Jaffe-Loewenfeld, p. 656. Pope Urban II held a general synod at Benevento from 28‚Äì31 August 1091. At the synod the Pope excommunicated the Emperor Henry IV and his antipope Wibert of Ravenna (called Clement III). It was also decreed that no one should be made a bishop unless he was already in holy orders. The synod also forbade the celebration of matrimony during Advent to the end of the Octave of the Epiphany (6 January).J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XX (Venice: A. Zatta 1774), p. 738. Hefele, Histoire des conciles (tr. H. Leclercq) Tome V, premi√®re partie (Paris: Letouzey 1912), pp. 352‚Äì353. Kehr, p. 71. In 1102 and 1108 Pope Paschal II held synods at Benevento. In the synod of 1108 he repeated his objections to lay investiture, and he forbade clerics from wearing expensive secular clothes. He also consecrated Landolfo as Archbishop of Benevento.Hefele, VII (tr. Leclercq 1872), pp. 80, 101. Between 16 March and 24 April 1117, Pope Paschal was resident in Benevento. In the synod of April 1117, he excommunicated Maurice Burdinus, Archbishop of Braga, the antipope (1118‚Äì1121) of Emperor Henry V, who called himself Gregory VIII.Hefele, VII, p. 144. On 10 March 1119, Archbishop Landolfo held a provincial synod at Benevento, in which anathemas were threatened against persons who committed theft against church property or merchants.Hefele, VII, p. 149. In 1374, Archbishop Hugo stated at a provincial council that the Church of Benevento had twenty-three suffragans, and that documents indicated that at one time it had had thirty-two. In 1599 Archbishop Massimiliano Palumbara held a diocesan synod, attended by seven of his suffragan bishops. The synod legislated against the practice of clerics removing relics from their containers so that they could be handled by the laity.Ughelli, p. 171. During his episcopate, Cardinal Pietro Francesco Orsini de Gravina, O.P. (1686‚Äì1730) held two diocesan synods, one in April 1693, and another in May 1698.G. Zigarelli, II, p. 56. During his term of office Archbishop Gianbattista Colombini, O.F.M. Conv. (1763‚Äì1774) held eight diocesan synods. Between 1755 and 1762, Cardinal Francesco Pacca held eight diocesan synods. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pacca held another fourteen, between 1825 and 1838. Cathedral and Chapter The cathedral of Maria SS. Assunta in Cielo was founded in Lombard times, but was destroyed by Allied bombings in World War II; it has kept the medieval Romanesque fa√ßade and bell tower, and the 8th century crypt. In 839 the alleged remains of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle were transferred to the Cathedral, to a chapel which had been built at the order of Prince Siccard of Benevento (d. 839). In 1338 Archbishop Arnaldus de Brussac moved the remains to a reconstructed chapel next to the cathedral.Stefano Borgia, I, p. 309 note 1. Kehr, p. 71. In 1316 the Cathedral Chapter had eighty-six Canons. In 1364, Archbishop Hugo reduced the number to thirty.

Ughelli, pp. 113‚Äì115. Kehr, p. 67, no. 63. * Enrico (1156‚Äì1170)On 28 September 1156, Pope Adrian IV issued a bull, granting Archbishop Enrico a renewal of the privileges granted by previous popes to the Church of Benevento.

Ughelli, pp. 148‚Äì149. Eubel, I, pp. 133, 206. * Pietro Dupin (1350‚Äì1360)A native of Benevento, Pietro Dupin, who had been named Bishop of Fr√©jus in 1348, was transferred to the diocese of Viterbo (1348‚Äì1350).

Coleti (in Ughelli, p. 151) believed that Guillaume was a Dominican who had for a few months been Bishop of Lomb√®s before being transferred to Benevento. Eubel, I, p. 310, however, calls the Bishop of Lomb√®s Guillaume Dufort, and says that he was Archdeacon of S. Antonii in the diocese of Rodez before his appointment to Lomb√®s on 18 January 1363, where he died in April 1365. Eubel's details makes Coleti's identification impossible. Plague infested southern France in 1360 and 1361, and carried off 100 bishops and 9 cardinals, according to Matteo Villani (Cronica;; Liber X. capitolo LXXI, pp. 366‚Äì367 Dragomanni).

Andrea at Aversa was appointed Eubel, II, p. 104, with note 4. Eubel admits Bartolomeo into the list of Archbishops of Benevento, but not Corrado Capece. Cf. Ughelli, pp. 165‚Äì166, who admits Capece in 1469. In 1470 at the provincial Council held in Benevento on 24 August, Capece is termed arcivescovo e governatore generale di Benevento.

The line runs from Attleboro to Middleborough via Taunton. Route The line diverges from Amtrak's Northeast Corridor just north of Attleboro station. From there, it runs east through Norton then southeast through downtown Taunton. At Cotley Junction (near Weir Village), it separates from the New Bedford Subdivision and turns east. The line ends with a wye to the MBTA Commuter Rail Middleborough/Lakeville Line just south of downtown Middleborough. History Middleborough Junction (Cotley Junction) station in the early 20th century The current Middleborough Subdivision is formed from sections of four different railroads built in the 19th century. The oldest section is from northwestern Taunton into downtown Taunton, opened in April 1836 as part of the Mansfield-Taunton Taunton Branch Railroad - one of the first railroad lines in New England. The New Bedford and Taunton Railroad completed an extension from Taunton south to New Bedford in 1840, including the current Middleboro Subdivision southeast of downtown Taunton. The Middleboro and Taunton Railroad opened a line from southeastern Taunton east to Middleborough in July 1856. In August 1871, the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad built a branch from Attleboro Junction in northwest Taunton to Attleboro. The Old Colony acquired the Middleborough and Taunton Railroad in 1874. The same year, the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad became the New Bedford Railroad. It joined the Boston, Clinton, Fitchburg and New Bedford Railroad in 1876. The Old Colony acquired that system in 1879, and was itself merged into the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1893. Year-round New York‚ÄìCape Cod and Boston‚ÄìFall River/New Bedford passenger service ended in 1958, and local service on the Attleboro‚ÄìTaunton and Cotley Junction‚ÄìMiddleborough segments somewhat before then. However, summer-only trains from New York to Hyannis used the line from Attleboro to Middleborough from 1960 to 1964, as did Boston‚ÄìHyannis service on the Taunton‚ÄìMiddleborough section briefly in 1961. The planned Middleborough station site The New Haven Railroad folded into Penn Central in 1969, and the line became part of Conrail in 1976. The station purchased the line from Conrail, along with several other branch lines in Southeastern Massachusetts, for $1.2 million in December 1982. The Attleboro‚ÄìMiddleborough route was used by Amtrak's seasonal Cape Codder service from 1986 to 1996, and by the Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad in 1988, both with a stop at . Freight service on the line was assigned to CSX in the 1999 breakup of Conrail. Portions of the Middleborough Secondary are planned for passenger use as part of the South Coast Rail project. Phase 1 in 2023 will extend Middleborough/Lakeville Line service to Fall River and New Bedford, with a new Middleborough station on the east end of the line. The MBTA issued a $403.5 million contract for the Middleborough Secondary and New Bedford Main Line portions of the project on August 24, 2020; construction was expected to begin later in 2020 and take 37 months. The work will upgrade Middleborough Secondary tracks for passenger service and construct the new Middleborough station. Phase 2, planned for 2030, will add passenger service on the portion from Weir Junction to Cotley Junction.

History There has been mining in the area for hundreds of years, in 1844 a copper seam was discovered that was so big it led to a 50 year mining boom and the creation of Europe‚Äôs biggest mine, Devon Great Consols. The copper ran low during the 1890s leading to mass unemployment and the emigration of surplus workers. World Heritage site The valley is incorporated inside the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape which is a World Heritage Site. The site was added to the World Heritage List during the 30th session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Vilnius, July 2006. Location The AONB straddles the administrative border between Cornwall and Devon and covers around 75 square miles of the lower River Tamar below Launceston. There are four ancient towns: Launceston in the North with a steam railway and Norman castle; Tavistock to the East and adjacent to Dartmoor; Callington in the West with a mural trail, and Saltash with the Royal Albert Bridge. Landmarks There are numerous landmarks and listed buildings including Devon Great Consols, the Tamar Valley Line and the National Trust's Cotehele and Buckland Abbey. Facilities Tamar Trails Tamar Trails is a collection of trails in the Tamar Valley, created by West Devon Borough Council and The Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty with funding from a number of organisations including the Heritage Lottery Fund, the South West Regional Development Agency and Devon County Council. The Tamar Trails were built to allow access to the heritage and natural features of the valley via a series of new cycling and footpaths. The trails stretch 25 km across the Tamar Valley, taking in historic mines and woodland. The building work started in 2007 and finished in 2013 with a total investment of ¬£7 million. A partnership of organisations own the trails which are managed by Tamar Community Trust. The trail passes wooded copses and disused mine workings and is used for walking, cycling, mountain biking, jogging or segway. Natural beauty The Valley was designated due to the natural beauty of its hills, valleys, forests, meadows and associated landscapes. The water has created good farmland and provides otters with a natural habitat. The birdlife includes avocets and wigeons. Activities There is canoeing, walking, horse riding, cycling, archery, a visitor centre with a cafe and tree surfing Tamar Trails Parkrun takes place each week starting at the Tamar Trails visitor centre. There is a heritage train service on the scenic Tamar Valley Line, boat trips on the Tamar Passenger Ferry or river cruises from Plymouth.

Biography He was born in Brooklyn, New York, studied at Cornell from 1885 to 1889, and in 1891 graduated with an M.D. from the Long Island College Hospital. After serving as an intern for a year, for nine years he was an assistant physician at the Binghamton (New York) State Hospital. There he collaborated with Boris Sidis. From 1903, he was superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital, a government psychiatric hospital in Washington, D.C.. There he spent the rest of his career. Also in 1903, he accepted the post of professor of nervous and mental diseases at Georgetown University, and in 1904 a similar chair at George Washington University, lecturing besides at the Army Medical School. White was president of the American Psychopathological Society in 1922, of the American Psychiatric Association in 1924‚Äì25, and of the American Psychoanalytical Society in 1928. He took an interest in forensic psychology, and worked for better cooperation between the American Psychiatric Association and the American Bar Association.

The diocese comprises the whole of the department of Lot. In the beginning it was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Bourges, and later, from 1676 to the time of the French Revolution, it was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Albi. From 1802 to 1822 Cahors was under the Archbishop of Toulouse, and combined the former Diocese of Rodez with a great part of the former Diocese of Vabres and the Diocese of Montauban. However, in 1822 it was restored almost to its pristine limits and again made suffragan to Albi. In the Diocese of Cahors in 2013 there was one priest for every 2,295 Catholics. History According to a tradition connected with the legend of St. Martial, this saint, deputed by St. Peter, came to Cahors in the first century and there dedicated a church to St. Stephen, while his disciple, St. Amadour (Amator), the Zaccheus of the Gospel and husband of St. Veronica, evangelized the diocese. In the seventeenth century these traditions were closely examined by the Abb√© Antoine Raymond de Fouillac, a friend of F√©nelon, and, according to him, the bones discovered at Rocamadour in 1166, and looked upon as the relics of Zaccheus, were in reality the bones of St. Amator, Bishop of Auxerre. A legend written about the year 1000 by the monks of Saint-Genou Abbey (in the Diocese of Bourges) relates that Genitus and his son Genulfus were sent to Gaul by Pope Sixtus II (257-59), and that Genulfus (Genou) was the first Bishop of Cahors. But Louis Duchesne repudiated this as legend. The first historically known Bishop of Cahors is St. Florentius, correspondent of Paulinus of Nola (ca. 354‚Äì431). The Diocese of Cahors counted among its bishops Hugues G√©raud (1312‚Äì16), who was implicated in the conspiracy against John XXII and sentenced to be burned alive; and Alain de Solminihac (1636‚Äì59), a reformer of the clergy. Diocesan organization The Cathedral of Saint- √âtienne de Cahors was served by a Chapter composed of fourteen individuals. The Bishop was considered a member of the Chapter, as were the Archdeacons of Cahors and Tournus; in addition there was a Precentor and a Treasurer, as well as nine other Canons. In addition there were four hebdomadarii, fourteen prebendaries, and twelve chaplains.Gallia christiana I, pp. 115-117. Ritzler, VI, p. 156 note 1. In 1251, Bishop Bartholomaeus secularized the Chapter,Lacroix-Ayma I, p. 354. and in 1253 issued new Statutes for them.Lacroix-Ayma I, p. 354. Scell√®s and Gilles (2002), p. 268. The diocese was divided into districts, each headed by an Archpriest. It is attested that by 1526 there were fourteen Archpriests,Longnon, p. 10. Gallia christiana I, pp. 117-118. though a number of them are far older, being mentioned already in the 12th century. Six archpriests are named in the 13th century. The archpriests were supervised by the Archdeacons, of which there were six by 1252: Montpezat, Tourn√®s, Figeac, Cahors, Saint-C√©r√©, and Vaux.Longnon, p. 11. There were still Archpriests of Montpezat, Figeac, Cahors and Vaux. In 1418, however, Bishop Guillaume (VI.) d'Arpajon decided to suppress superfluous offices and reduced the number of archdeacons to two: Cahors and Tourn√®s; these two continued to exist down to the Revolution. City of Cahors Location of Cahors The city of Cahors was visited by Pope Callistus II (1119‚Äì24) in 1119, where, on 26 August 1119 he dedicated the high altar of the Cathedral.J. Giraud, Annuaire statistique et administratif du D√©partement du Lot, ann√©e 1841 (Cahors: J.G. Plantade 1841), p. 87. It was also the birthplace of Jacques d'Euse (1244‚Äì1334), who became pope in 1316 under the title of John XXII. The tower of his palace is still to be seen in Cahors. He provided a charter for a university there, dated 7 June 1331, its law faculty being so celebrated as to boast at times of 1200 pupils. There were three colleges at Cahors: P√©legry (1358), Rodez (1371), and San Michel (1473). F√©nelon studied at this institution, which, in 1751, was dissolved as a separate institution and annexed to the University of Toulouse. In the sixteenth century the Diocese of Cahors was severely tried by religious wars, and the Coll√®ge de P√©legry, which provided for a certain number of university students without cost, became noted for the way in which these young men defended Cahors against the Huguenots. The War of the Spanish Succession in its turn took a heavy toll on the good order of the university. In 1707 King Louis XIV found it necessary to reform the Coll√®ge de P√©legry and provide it with new statutes.Baudel, pp. 161-162. In 1680 the town of Cahors is reckoned as having some 12,000 inhabitants.Ritzler, V, p. 151 note 1. By 1766 the population is estimated to have grown to 15,000 persons.Ritzler, VI, p. 156 note 1. The Cathedral of Saint-√âtienne, built at the end of the eleventh and restored in the fourteenth century, has a beautiful Gothic cloister. Recent archival and archaeological discoveries have demonstrated, however, that the westwork of the cathedral, once thought to be of the 14th century, was actually completed by 1288.Scell√®s and Gilles (2002), p. 249. Plans were already under way by the mid-1240s, when Pope Innocent IV granted indulgences to those who contributed financially to the project; these were renewed by Pope Alexander IV in 1255, and yet another grant was made in 1289 by Nicholas III. The great builders were Bishop Bartholomeus de Roux and Bishop Raimond de Cornil. In 1285 Bishop Raimond persuaded the Chapter to join with him in a commitment to donate half of the first year of income of every newly granted benefice in the diocese to the building fund.Scell√®s and Gilles (2002), p. 268, 269. When, in the Middle Ages, the bishops officiated in this church they had the privilege, as barons and counts of Cahors, of depositing their sword and armour on the altar. In the diocese local honors are given to St. Sacerdos, Bishop of Limoges, and his mother, Mundana (seventh century); Esperie (Speria), virgin and martyr (eighth century); St. G√©raud, Count of Aurillac (beginning of the eleventh century); Blessed Christopher, companion of St. Francis of Assisi and founder of a Franciscan convent at Cahors in 1216, and Blessed Jean-Gabriel Perboyre, born in the village of Mongesty, 1802, and martyred in China, 1840. The city of Figeac owed its origin to a Benedictine abbey founded by Pepin in 755. The principal places of pilgrimage are: Notre-Dame de Rocamadour, visited by St. Louis (1245), Charles the Fair (1324), and Louis XI (1463); Notre-Dame de F√©lines and Notre-Dame de Verdale, both dating back to the eleventh century; Saint-Hilaire Lalbenque, where relics of St. Benedict Joseph Labre are preserved. The Revolution During the French Revolution the Diocese of Cahors was abolished and its territory subsumed into a new diocese, coterminous with the new 'Departement de Lot' and a suffragan of the 'Metropole du Sud' in the departement of Haute-Garonne, with its seat at Toulouse.Text of Civil Constitution of the Clergy (in English) Retrieved: 2016-09-02. The clergy were required to swear and oath to the Constitution, and under the terms of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy a new bishop was to be elected by all the voters of the departement, who were not even required to be Catholics. This placed them in schism with the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope. The electors of the Diocese of Lot duly met, but found no obvious candidate in the department of Lot; they therefore chose an outsider, Abb√© Jean-Louis Gouttes as their new Constitutional Bishop. He has also been chosen by the electors of Seine-et Loire, which he preferred. The electors of Lot then, on 27 February 1791, elected Jean d'Anglars, the Archpriest of Cajarc.Longnon, pp. 10 and 16. He was consecrated at Tulle on 29 April by Jean-Jacques Brival. The legitimate Bishop Louis Maria de Nicolai died in 1791, leaving the diocese vacant. On 11 November 1791 Pope Pius VI appointed Charles-Nicolas de B√©cave to be the Vicar-Apostolic of the Diocese of Cahors in the absence of a bishop; he served until the appointment of a new bishop in 1802. Both the Constitutional Church and the Roman Catholic Church were severely stressed in 1793 and 1794 by the Terror, and the discovery that Reason was to replace Faith as the governing principle in France.Nothing is known about D'Anglars activities during the terror except that he saved the relics of the Cathedral. Pisani, p. 395. In 1801 First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered all the Constitutional Bishops to resign. He was striking a Concordat with Pope Pius VII, which included the liquidation of the Constitutional Church. In accordance with the Concordat, the Pope revived the Diocese of Cahors and placed it in the hands of Guillaume-Balthasar Cousin de Grainville of Montpellier. D'Anglars was made an honorary Canon of the Cathedral of Cahors. Bishops To 1000 : [Genulfus]Genulfus is a ninth century concoction of hagiographers: Gallia christiana I, p. 117.

Retrieved March 29, 2016 History According to legend, Christianity was introduced into Caiazzo by St. Priscus, one of the seventy-two disciples of Jesus Christ, first Bishop of Capua. The story is universally rejected.D'Avino, p. 147, column 2. Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia XX, p. 262. The first known bishop of Caiazzo was said to have been Arigisus, the exact time of whose episcopate is uncertain; however, as the name indicates, it could not have been before the beginning of the seventh century, when the Lombards settled in that region, since his name appears to be Lombard.Argisius is known only from a single mention in the episcopal diptychs of Caiazzo. Ughelli, p. 441. There is no documentary evidence for his existence. The first documentary evidence for the Church of Caiazzo comes in a privilege granted by the Archbishop John of Capua to Bishop Urso; Archbishop John was consecrated in 967.Kehr, p. 271. The reading of the name \\"Urso\\" is uncertain. Cathedral and Chapter The cathedral of Caiazzo was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and to Saint Stephen of Macerata, the eleventh century Bishop of Caiazzo.Ughelli, p. 441-442. D'Avino, p. 148 column 1. The cathedral was consecrated on 23 July 1284, by Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi, Bishop of Sabina and papal Legate in Sicily.Cappelletti, pp. 266-267. The cathedral was staffed and administered by a corporate body, the Chapter, composed of three dignities (the Archdeacon, and two Primicerii) and twenty Canons (two of whom are designated Theologus and Primicerius, in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent).Ughelli, p. 440. In 1696, there were twenty-two Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 134. The town of Caiazzo had approximately 1,400 inhabitants, and two other parish churches, as well as three monasteries and one nunnery. There was also a Collegiate Church, Santissima Annunziata, served by a college of eight chaplains.D'Avino, p. 148 column 2. The diocesan seminary of Cajazzo was founded by Bishop Fabio Mirto Frangipani, who had been one of the secretaries of the Council of Trent. It had space for seventy resident students, from grade school through high school.D'Avino, p. 148 column 2. Concordat of 1818 Following the extinction of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, the Congress of Vienna authorized the restoration of the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples. Since the French occupation had seen the abolition of many Church institutions in the Kingdom, as well as the confiscation of most Church property and resources, it was imperative that Pope Pius VII and King Ferdinand IV reach agreement on restoration and restitution. Ferdinand, however, was not prepared to accept the pre-Napoleonic situation, in which Naples was a feudal subject of the papacy. Lengthy, detailed, and acrimonious negotiations ensued. In 1818, a new concordat with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies committed the pope to the suppression of more than fifty small dioceses in the kingdom. The ecclesiastical province of Naples was spared from any suppressions, but the province of Capua was affected. Pope Pius VII, in the bull \\"De Utiliori\\" of 27 June 1818, chose to unite the two dioceses of Calvi and Teano under the leadership of one bishop, aeque principaliter. He also suppressed the diocese of Venafro completely, and assigned its people and territory to the diocese of Isernia. Similarly, Carinola was suppressed and assigned to Suessa. Caiazzo was suppressed, and assigned to the diocese of Caserta.\\"Pariterque in perpetuum supprimendo Episcopalem Ecclesiam Caiacensem, seu Calatinensem, eamdem cum suo Diocesano territorio alteri Episcopali Ecclesiae Casertana integrae aggregamus,\\" D'Avino, p. 147. The cathedral of Caiazzo was reduced to the status of a collegiate church.Cappelletti, p. 275. In the same concordat, the King was confirmed in the right to nominate candidates for vacant bishoprics, subject to the approval of the pope. That situation persisted down until the final overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy in 1860.Bullarii Romani continuatio Tomus 15, p. 7 column 1, \\"Articulus XXVIII\\". The diocese of Caiazzo was revived, however, and a new bishop was appointed on 15 March 1852.Cappelletti, p. 275. The new bishop, Gabriele Ventriglia, was transferred from the diocese of Cotrone. The diocese of Caiazzo is already mentioned as \\"newly established\\" in the 1851 volume of Notizie. There were no issues in 1849 and 1850, due to the flight of Pius IX from Rome. Caserta lost the territory which it had gained in 1818. Suppression of the diocese On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat, which was accompanied in the next year by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Otherwise Caiazzo and Alise, who shared a bishop, might have become the diocese of Alise e Caiazzo. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Caiazzo and Alise be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis . The seat of the diocese was to be in Alise, and the cathedral of Alise was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedral in Caiazzo was to become a co-cathedral, and the cathedral Chapter was to be a Capitulum Concathedralis.

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 422 - 423. The clan does not currently have a clan chief, but following a petition to the Lord Lyon a family convention was held at Culloden on 15 April 2016. Submissions from four applicants for the role of commander were heard and Iain Donald MacGillivray was nominated and subsequently received his commission from the Lord Lyon. The role subsists for an initial period of five years but can be renewed for a further five years, and thereafter the commander can petition to be chief. History Origins of the clan The clan MacGillivray was an important clan even before the Norsemen were driven out of the Outer Hebrides by King Somerled, who was Lord of the Isles in the 12th century. In 1222, Alexander II of Scotland subdued Argyll, and the clan Mhic Gillebrath became dispersed. Some of the clan remained on the Isle of Mull, while others stayed in Morvern. There is a tradition that asserts that the chief of the clan placed himself under the protection of the chiefs of clan Mackintosh, who were also chiefs of the Chattan Confederation. Thereafter the clan MacGillivray belonged to the clan Chattan. 16th to 17th centuries romanticised Victorian-era illustration of a MacGillivray clansman by R. R. McIan from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands published in 1845. The MacGillivray clan was first accurately recorded in Dunmaglass in 1549. In 1609, there was a great gathering of the Chattan Confederation, at which loyalties were given to the Mackintosh chief, and the haill kin and race of MacGillivray was represented by Malcolm MacGillivray of Dalcrombie and Duncan MacGillivray of Dunmaglass. The MacGillivrays were persecuted by their Calvinist and Presbyterian neighbors owing to their support of Episcopal polity of the church. 18th century & Jacobite risings Along with most of the other clans of the Chattan Confederation, the MacGillivrays were staunch Jacobites in both the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745. During the 1745 rising, the chief of Mackintoshes and clan Chattan was however a serving officer in the Black Watch regiment of the British Army, but his wife, Lady Anne Mackintosh (n√©e Farquharson), rallied the Chattan Confederation in support of the Jacobites and placed chief Alexander MacGillivray in command of the clan Chattan regiment. Alexander MacGillivray was killed leading his clan at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 along with many of his followers. A graveyard at Dunlichity commemorates the many MacGillivrays who fell in the battle. After Culloden, many MacGillivrays emigrated across the Atlantic, where many of them were successful, particularly as traders. Clan chief Dr Joseph Morrow QC The last chief to live at Dunmaglass was the 13th laird, Capt. John William MacGillivray, who had to sell his estate and died without an heir in 1914.To Find a Chief Retrieved on 2007-11-11 The chiefship then passed to a cousin of his, John Farquhar MacGillivray, who lived in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. John Farquhar MacGillivray was chief for 32 years when he died in 1942 without an heir, and the last chief of clan MacGillivray. A Dr Angus MacGillivary [d.1947] tried to claim the chieftainship but was unable to prove his lineage‚Äîalthough he was awarded a variation of the MacGillivray coat of arms in 1914. Another Canadian, Col. George B. MacGillivray, later petitioned Lord Lyon King of Arms three times between 1953 and 1989 to be recognised as chief. Lord Lyon, not satisfied with the proofs MacGillivray submitted, denied him status of chief, but commissioned him as commander of the clan. MacGillivray served as Commander for five years before dying in 1994, and to this day the clan remains without a Chief, but does once again have a Commander to lead it. In 2016, four clan MacGillivary Societies of Scotland, America, Australia and the Netherlands elected Iain MacGillivray as the clan's Commander and The Lord Lyon presented him with his Commission, appointing and confirming him in this important leadership role for Clan MacGillivray. Clan castles Dunmaglas, which is about six miles east of Inverfarigaig in Inverness-shire, was held by the MacGillivrays from at least the sixteenth century, if not earlier.

Nationwide, the Army National Guard comprises approximately one half of the US Army's available combat forces and approximately one third of its support organization. National coordination of various state National Guard units are maintained through the National Guard Bureau. Montana Army National Guard units are trained and equipped as part of the United States Army. The same ran ks and insignia are used and National Guardsmen are eligible to receive all United States military awards. The Montana Guard also bestows a number of state awards for local services rendered in or to the state of Montana. The Montana Army National Guard maintains facilities in 28 communities. History 163rd Armored Brigade The Montana Army National Guard was originally formed in 1867. The 163d Infantry dates its history to independent companies grouped together around 1900. The Militia Act of 1903 organized the various state militias into the present National Guard system. The 163rd Infantry Regiment of the Montana Guard formed part of the 41st Infantry Division, which fought through the Pacific during World War II. The Regiment was inducted into the Regular Army in September 1940, and were sent to Camp Murray at Fort Lewis, Washington. They participated in large-scale military exercises in California in 1941. On 7 Dec. 1941 small units were detailed to guard the Washington coastline from Japanese saboteurs. In March 1942 they were sent to Australia. Their engagements included the Battle of Buna-Gona in 1942‚Äì1943, the Salamaua-Lae campaign in 1943, Operations Reckless and Persecution and the Battle of Biak in 1944, and the liberation of the Philippines in 1945. In September 1945 the Regiment went ashore at Hiro, Japan as part of the occupation of that country. By this time most of the original Montanan troops had been discharged.Glynn, Gary. Montana's Home Front During World War II, 2nd ed., Big Elk Books, Missoula. 2012 The Montana ARNG maintained the 163rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (whose roots date back to 1884), until 1988. In 1985 its units included the 1/163 Cavalry, the 2/163 Cavalry, the 3/163 Cavalry (based in Texas), an Air Troop, an Attack Helicopter Troop (based in Utah), and the 1063rd Engineer Company.Isby and Kamps, Armies of NATO's Central Front, Jane's Publishing Company, 1985, p.385. The Montana units of the 163rd Armored Cavalry Regiment were converted and expanded into the all-Montana 163rd Armored Brigade on 1 September 1988. The MT ARNG maintained the 163rd Armored Brigade at least until 1995. On the disbandment of the 163rd Armored Brigade, the 1st Battalion, 163rd Infantry was reassigned to the 116th Cavalry Brigade headquartered in Idaho. 'Commonly referred to as the Griz Battalion, the 1-163rd at first was designated as a Cavalry Regiment in 1953, named the 163rd Cavalry Regiment. The unit was renamed the 1-163rd Infantry Battalion during the 2006 reorganization of the Montana Army National Guard, and was re- designated as Cavalry once again in 2007, combining mechanized infantry with Abrams tank units.'http://www.mtguard.com/MTARNGunits163rd.php, accessed September 2009 In the 2006 reorganization, the 1st Battalion, 190th Field Artillery at Billings became the 190th Combat Service Support Battalion.

Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations (2001-?); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard. Active duty callups For much of the final decades of the twentieth century, National Guard personnel typically served \\"One weekend a month, two weeks a year\\", with a portion working for the Guard in a full-time capacity. The current forces formation plans of the US Army call for the typical National Guard unit (or National Guardsman) to serve one year of active duty for every three years of service. More specifically, current Department of Defense policy is that no Guardsman will be involuntarily activated for a total of more than 24 months (cumulative) in one six-year enlistment period (this policy is due to change 1 August 2007, the new policy states that soldiers will be given 24 months between deployments of no more than 24 months, individual states have differing policies).

Its cathedral episcopal see is a Minor basilica: Basilica Cattedrale di Ss. Florido e Amanzio Basilica, dedicated to Saints Floridus (the diocesan patron saint) and Amantius, in Citt√† di Castello. The province and diocese have a Marian second Minor Basilica: Santuario-Basilica della Madonna del Transito Santuario, in Canoscio.  History  Territory During the persecution of Diocletian (303), St. Crescentianus, a Roman knight, and ten others suffered martyrdom at Tifernum. The bishopric was erected circa 450 AD. In 550, Fantalogus, by order of the Ostrogothic king Totila, took and destroyed the city then known as Tifernum or Civitas Tiberina. Citt√† di Castello was later rebuilt around a castle, giving origin to the name used today. At the time of the sack of the city by Fantalogus, the bishop was Florius, later a friend of Gregory the Great. In 590 the diocese of Tifernum gained territory from the suppressed Diocese of Sant'Angelo in Vado. By the Donation of Pepin (752), it became subject to the Holy See. It lost territories in 1013, to establish the Territorial Abbey of Sansepolcro, and on 19 June 1325 to establish the Diocese of Cortona. The first-known bishop of this see was Ennodius, present at a Roman council (465) under Pope Hilary. In 711 Arian Longobards put to death the bishop of the city, Albertus, and his deacon Britius. In 875 Bishop Rainaldus was summoned to appear before the papal apocrisiarius Gregory and the magister militum Georgius, the vestiarius of the Patriarch of Aquileia, to answer a charge of homicide. Having failed to deal with the situation, despite several letters of excommunication, Rainaldus was summoned by Pope John VIII to appear in Rome and stand trial. Rainaldus appeared at the papal court, but stealthily avoided taking his seat in the synod, and instead fled the city by going over the walls like a thief. Revealing himself to be guilty, he was immediately excommunicated and interdicted. The Pope announced the result in a letter to the Emperor Louis.Kehr, IV, pp. 99-100, nos. 1-2. Pope Celestine II (Guido di Castello) (1143‚Äì1144) was a native of Citt√† di Castello.Mangherini-Graziani, II, p. 59. Salvador Miranda, The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, \\"Guido di Castello\\"; retrieved: 30 October 2018. In 1375 Citt√† di Castello joined in the insurrection of other cities of the Papal States. Cardinal Robert of Geneva (later antipope as Clement VII), undertook to recapture it with Breton mercenaries, but was repulsed. Under Pope Martin V, however, it was taken by Braccio da Montone (1420). Later, Nicol√≤ Vitelli, with the help of Florence and Milan, became absolute ruler. In 1474 Pope Sixtus IV sent there his nephew, CardinalGiuliano della Rovere (later Pope Julius II). After fruitless negotiations he laid siege to the city, but Vitelli did not surrender until he learned that the command of the army had been given to Duke Federigo of Urbino. The following year Vitelli tried unsuccessfully to recapture the city; fear of Cesare Borgia alone induced him to desist.Umberto Benigni (1908), \\"Citt√† di Castello.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. Retrieved: 29 Oct. 2018. On 22 September 1515 it lost more territory to the Territorial Abbey of Sansepolcro. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. Bishop Giovanni Battista Lattanzi (1750‚Äì1782) held his first diocesan synod on 23‚Äì25 September 1766. Bishop Francesco Antonio Mondelli (1814‚Äì1825) held a diocesan synod on 8‚Äì10 April 1818.

It is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Braga. From 1472, the bishop of Coimbra held the comital title of Count of Arganil, being thus called Bishop-Count (). History The first known bishop was Lucentius, who participated in the first council of Braga (563),This is generally referred to as the Second Council of Braga, though it has long been known that the Acts of the First Council of Braga (of 411) are a forgery. Eight bishops, including the Metropolitan, attended the council of 563. J.-D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus IX (Florence: A. Zatta 1763), p. 780, 782. the metropolitan See of Coimbra, until the latter was attached to the ecclesiastical province of M√©rida (650-62). Titular bishops of Coimbra continued the succession under the Islamic conquest, one of whom witnessed the consecration of the church of Santiago de Compostela in 876. The see was re-established in 1088, after the reconquest of the city of Coimbra by the Christian forces of Sisnando Davides (1064). The first bishop of the new series was Martin.Martin was present in 1088 at the Council of Santa Maria de Fusellos as bishop-elect. In the midst of the difficulties of restoring the Church in Portugal in the wake of the request of the country from the Arabs, Bishop Mauricio Burdino applied to Pope Paschal II and obtained a bull Apostolicae Sedis (24 March 1101),Caro Erdmann, Papsturkunden in Portugal (Berlin: Weidmann 1927), pp. 154-156, no. 2. assuring him of the possession of the old territory of his diocese, including parts which were once part of the diocese as they are reconquered from the Moors and the Arabs. He also assigned the bishop, for the time being, the territories of the vacant bishoprics of Lamego and Viseu, until such time as they could have their own bishops; and the territory and parishes of the Villa Vacaricia, which had been given by Count Raymond to the diocese of Coimbra.M.C. Cunha (2013), p. 135. From 1139 Coimbra was the capital of the kingdom of Portugal and a principal beneficiary of the generosity of its kings, until the seat of government was moved to Lisbon in 1260. Among the more famous bishops have been Pedro (1300), chancellor of King Dinis; Jo√£o Galv√£o, who was granted the title of Conde de Arganil for himself and his successors, on 25 September 1472 by King Alfonso V, in gratitude for his service in the conquest of Arzila and Tangier; and Manuel de Menezes (1573‚Äì78), former rector of the University of Coimbra from 1556 to 1560,The post of Rector of the University was in the gift of the King of Portugal. It was not a prerogative of the bishops of Coimbra. Bishop Agostino Ribeira of Angra was Rector from 1537 to 1543, and Bishop Bernardo da Cruz of S. Thom√© from 1543. Theophilo Braga, Historia da Universidate de Coimbra I (Lisbon 1892), p. 463; II (1895), p. 837. who fell with King Sebastian in the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir on 4 August 1578. University of Coimbra The University of Coimbra, the only university in Portugal until the 20th century, was founded in 1290, but in Lisbon, not in Coimbra. A papal bull was obtained from Pope Nicholas IV,Sane ad audientiam (9 August 1290): and King Dinis I carried out the act of establishment. It was not until 1308 that the university was moved to Coimbra, due principally to the hostility of the people of Lisbon, though in 1338 it moved back. In 1354 the University returned to Coimbra, and in 1377 was established back in Lisbon. The University remained in Lisbon until King John III moved it back to Coimbra permanently in 1537. The involvement of the bishops of Coimbra in the affairs of the University was therefore intermittent and superficial, at least until the second half of the sixteenth century. Then they protected its medieval and Catholic character with zeal. One bishop, Miguel da Anuncia√ß√£o, spent eight years in prison for defying the efforts of the government to modernize the educational system of Portugal's university. Theophilo Braga, Historia da Universidate de Coimbra III (Lisbon 1898), pp. 95-99. Cathedrals The Old Cathedral of Coimbra, built in the first half of the 12th century, partly at the expense of Bishop Miguel and his chapter, is a remarkable monument of Romanesque architecture. The architect was Robert of Clermont. It was dedicated to the Assumption of the Body of the Virgin Mary into Heaven.Barbosa Morujao, p. 242. The new cathedral, a Renaissance church built in 1580 as a church for its adjacent Jesuit college, is another important monument. The episcopal palace was built in the 18th century. The Cathedral was administered by a Chapter, whose eight dignities (not dignitaries) included: the Dean, the Cantor, the Scholasticus, the Treasurer, and the three Archdeacons (Coimbra, Sena). There were twenty- one Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 163 note 1. Monastery of Santa Cruz The most important monastery in the diocese is Santa Cruz Monastery, founded in 1131 by Afonso Henriques, and for some time the most important in the kingdom by reason of its wealth and privileges.Ingo Fleisch, \\"The Portuguese Clergy and the European Universities in the 12th and 13th Centuries,\\" in: Its prior was authorized, or so it was claimed, by Anastasius IVThe bull of Anastasius IV granting this privilege is a forgery. Erdmann, Papsturkunden in Portugal, p. 219, no. 53. and Celestine IIIThe bull of Celestine III of 25 February 1192 recognizes the agreement made between the Prior and Brothers of Santa Cruz on the one hand, and Bishop Miguel and the Canons of Coimbra on the other, granting liberty from episcopal control, and in a bull of 26 February 1192 confirms the ancient customs and liberties and immunities of their church. Erdmann, pp. 350-352. This might have been taken to confirm the privilege granted in the forged bull. to wear the episcopal insignia.

History Founded in the sixth century, Crema endured a particularly hazardous geographical position in terms of its independence.Sforza Benvenuti, I, p. 8. It was no great distance from Milan, and its neighbor to the east, the Serene Republic of Venice, was always pressing to expand its holdings on the mainland. In addition the German emperors held the overlordship of the Po Valley and from time to time dominated the political situation.Solera, p. 8. Otto of Freising (died 1158), for instance, draws attention to Crema's situation in the perpetual struggle between Cremona and Milan. Crema was situated just halfway between Cremona and Milan. It bore a good deal of the military action, and, as Cremona regularly rejected its demands in litigation for redress and reparations, Crema developed a grudge. This was particularly wrenching since Crema was politically subject to Cremona and spiritually subject to its bishop. To gain an advantage, the leaders of Cremona urged the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa to destroy Crema in exchange for a considerable sum of money, which would allow him to pursue his ventures in the Po Valley. The citizens of Crema therefore threw in their lot with Milan.Otto of Freising, Gesta Friderici Imperatoris Book IV, chapter 39, in: Monumenta Germaniae Historica Tomus XX, (Hannover 1868), p. 466.

History During the French occupation,Casalis, pp. 780-782. religious orders were dissolved or expelled, and convents and monasteries closed and confiscated by the government. In Cuneo this included two monasteries and the convent of the Capuchins. The monastery of S. Annunziata became a hospice for the poor and an orphanage, and the monastery of the Terziarie became first a prison and then a warehouse for salt and a military barracks.Casalis, p. 743. Following the Concordat of 1801 between Bonaparte and Pope Pius VII, the French demanded a reduction in the number of dioceses in Piedmont and their conformity to rules established by the French government. The Pope was compelled to issue a bull, Gravissimis causis (1 June 1803), in which the number of dioceses in Piedmont was reduced to eight: Turin, Vercelli, Ivrea, Acqui, Asti, Mondovi, Alessandria and Saluzzo. This, and the appointment of bishops by Napoleon, caused great confusion, and once Bonaparte had been compelled to abdicate, and the Kingdom of Sardina was returned to the House of Savoy, a revision of the ecclesiastical situation was essential. The revision was carried out in 1817 by Pope Pius VII in his bull, Beati Petri (17 July 1817). The new diocese of Cuneo was created as diocesan borders were redrawn.Bullarii Romani continuatio, VII, pp. 1490-1503, ¬ß 28. Cappelletti, p. 345.

Giovanni e Paolo The Roman Catholic diocese of Ferentino existed until 1986, when it was united into the new diocese of Frosinone- Veroli-Ferentino. History It is said, by Ferdinand Ughelli, that in the time of Emperor Constantine, in the 1st third of the fourth century, Ferentino had its own bishop;Ughelli, I, 672, makes the assertion without providing evidence, or even a reference to other literature. Francesco Lanzoni, p. 168, questions the asssertion: \\"Non saprei donde l'Ughelli (I, 672) lo abbia desunto. E senza prove.\\" but the first bishop known by name is Bassus, at the end of the 5th century. Bishop Redemptus (about 570) is mentioned in the Dialogues of Gregory the Great, but Redemptus was bishop of Ferentum in Tuscany, not Ferentinum in Latium.Gregory, Dialogues III. 38. Lanzoni, p. 168. Pope Gregory also refers to a Bishop Boniface, but he was a bishop of Ferentum in Tuscany.Gregory, Dialogues I. 9. Gams, p. 677. Diocesan reorganization The Second Vatican Council, in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses, in particular those with financial and personnel problems.In its decree Christus Dominus, section 22, it stated: \\"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\\" It also decreed that the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. This applied to the dioceses of Veroli and Frosinone. The Vatican therefore continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of dioceses. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Veroli, Frosinone, and Ferentino be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Frusinatensis-Verulana-Ferentina. The seat of the diocese was to be in Frosinone, whose cathedral was to serve as the cathedral of the merged dioceses. The cathedrals in Veroli and Ferentino were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Frosinone, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Veroli, Frosinone, and Ferentino.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1987), pp. 825-828.

Premise Scratchy & Co. starred Elliot Henderson-Boyle as \\"Reg\\" and Mark Speight as \\"Scratchy\\". Other characters included Annabel and a Scottish girl, both played by comedian and impressionist Ronni Ancona. The main gimmick of the show was that the cast wore \\"solid rubber wigs\\" and eccentric jackets. A stylistic similarity might be noted between this approach and Max Headroom. Later series introduced other characters such as Sedgely the penguin and Fathead the football. Later on, the series moved away from the original Max Headroom-esque style, into a studio where Scratchy (now minus the rubber wig) sat behind a desk, with Reg behind a window. At this point, guests were invited into the studio and interviewed. However, most of the characters which had been introduced earlier were dropped. Gail Porter was a frequent guest presenter in the third and the fourth (final) series. The show was nominated for a BAFTA.

It's called hyperbolic because the fundamental condition that generates the Lorentzian manifold is * t^2 - r^2 = T^2 (t and r being the usual variables of time and radius) which is one of the usual equations representing an hyperbola. But this expression is only true relative to the ordinary origin; this article then outline bases for generalizing the concept to any pair of points in spacetime. This is relevant to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, and potentially to other metric gravitational theories.  Definitions  There are several equivalent definitions of global hyperbolicity. Let M be a smooth connected Lorentzian manifold without boundary. We make the following preliminary definitions: * M is non-totally vicious if there is at least one point such that no closed timelike curve passes through it. * M is causal if it has no closed causal curves. * M is non-total imprisoning if no inextendible causal curve is contained in a compact set. This property implies causality. * M is strongly causal if for every point p and any neighborhood U of p there is a causally convex neighborhood V of p contained in U, where causal convexity means that any causal curve with endpoints in V is entirely contained in V. This property implies non-total imprisonment. * Given any point p in M, J^+(p) [resp. J^-(p)] is the collection of points which can be reached by a future-directed [resp. past-directed] continuous causal curve starting from p. * Given a subset S of M, the domain of dependence of S is the set of all points p in M such that every inextendible causal curve through p intersects S. * A subset S of M is achronal if no timelike curve intersects S more than once. * A Cauchy surface for M is a closed achronal set whose domain of dependence is M. The following conditions are equivalent: # The spacetime is causal, and for every pair of points p and q in M, the space of continuous future directed causal curves from p to q is compact in the \\\\mathcal{C}^0 topology. # The spacetime has a Cauchy surface. # The spacetime is causal, and for every pair of points p and q in M, the subset J^-(p)\\\\cap J^+(q) is compact. # The spacetime is non- total imprisoning, and for every pair of points p and q in M, the subset {J^-(p)\\\\cap J^+(q)} is contained in a compact set (that is, its closure is compact). If any of these conditions are satisfied, we say M is globally hyperbolic. If M is a smooth connected Lorentzian manifold with boundary, we say it is globally hyperbolic if its interior is globally hyperbolic. Other equivalent characterizations of global hyperbolicity make use of the notion of Lorentzian distance d(p,q):=\\\\sup_\\\\gamma l(\\\\gamma) where the supremum is taken over all the C^1 causal curves connecting the points (by convention d=0 if there is no such curve). They are * A strongly causal spacetime for which d is finite valued.J. K. Beem, P. E. Ehrlich, and K. L. Easley, \\"Global Lorentzian Geometry\\". New York: Marcel Dekker Inc. (1996). * A non-total imprisoning spacetime such that d is continuous for every metric choice in the conformal class of the original metric.  Remarks  Global hyperbolicity, in the first form given above, was introduced by LerayJean Leray, \\"Hyperbolic Differential Equations.\\" Mimeographed notes, Princeton, 1952. in order to consider well- posedness of the Cauchy problem for the wave equation on the manifold. In 1970 GerochRobert P. Geroch, \\"Domain of dependence\\", Journal of Mathematical Physics 11, (1970) 437, 13pp proved the equivalence of definitions 1 and 2. Definition 3 under the assumption of strong causality and its equivalence to the first two was given by Hawking and Ellis.Stephen Hawking and George Ellis, \\"The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time\\". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1973). As mentioned, in older literature, the condition of causality in the first and third definitions of global hyperbolicity given above is replaced by the stronger condition of strong causality. In 2007, Bernal and S√°nchezAntonio N. Bernal and Miguel S√°nchez, \\"Globally hyperbolic spacetimes can be defined as 'causal' instead of 'strongly causal'\\", Classical and Quantum Gravity 24 (2007), no. 3, 745‚Äì749 showed that the condition of strong causality can be replaced by causality. In particular, any globally hyperbolic manifold as defined in 3 is strongly causal. Later Hounnonkpe and Minguzzi Raymond N. Hounnonkpe and Ettore Minguzzi, \\"Globally hyperbolic spacetimes can be defined without the ‚Äòcausal‚Äô condition\\", Classical and Quantum Gravity 36 (2019), 197001 proved that for quite reasonable spacetimes, more precisely those of dimension larger than three which are non-compact or non-totally vicious, the 'causal' condition can be dropped from definition 3. In definition 3 the closure of J^-(p)\\\\cap J^+(q) seems strong (in fact, the closures of the sets J^\\\\pm(p) imply causal simplicity, the level of the causal hierarchy of spacetimesE. Minguzzi and M. S√°nchez, \\"The Causal Hierarchy of Spacetimes\\", in Recent developments in pseudo-Riemannian geometry of ESI Lect. Math. Phys., edited by H. Baum and D. Alekseevsky (European Mathematical Society Publishing House (EMS), Zurich, 2008), p. 299 which stays just below global hyperbolicity). It is possible to remedy this problem strengthening the causality condition as in definition 4 proposed by MinguzziEttore Minguzzi, \\"Characterization of some causality conditions through the continuity of the Lorentzian distance\\", Journal of Geometry and Physics 59 (2009), 827‚Äì833 in 2009. This version clarifies that global hyperbolicity sets a compatibility condition between the causal relation and the notion of compactness: every causal diamond is contained in a compact set and every inextendible causal curve escapes compact sets. Observe that the larger the family of compact sets the easier for causal diamonds to be contained on some compact set but the harder for causal curves to escape compact sets. Thus global hyperbolicity sets a balance on the abundance of compact sets in relation to the causal structure. Since finer topologies have less compact sets we can also say that the balance is on the number of open sets given the causal relation. Definition 4 is also robust under perturbations of the metric (which in principle could introduce closed causal curves). In fact using this version it has been shown that global hyperbolicity is stable under metric perturbations.J.J. Benavides Navarro and E. Minguzzi, \\"Global hyperbolicity is stable in the interval topology\\", Journal of Mathematical Physics 52 (2011), 112504 In 2003, Bernal and S√°nchezAntonio N. Bernal and Miguel S√°nchez, \\" On smooth Cauchy hypersurfaces and Geroch's splitting theorem\\", Communications in Mathematical Physics 243 (2003), no. 3, 461‚Äì470 showed that any globally hyperbolic manifold M has a smooth embedded three-dimensional Cauchy surface, and furthermore that any two Cauchy surfaces for M are diffeomorphic. In particular, M is diffeomorphic to the product of a Cauchy surface with \\\\mathbb{R}. It was previously well known that any Cauchy surface of a globally hyperbolic manifold is an embedded three-dimensional C^0 submanifold, any two of which are homeomorphic, and such that the manifold splits topologically as the product of the Cauchy surface and \\\\mathbb{R}. In particular, a globally hyperbolic manifold is foliated by Cauchy surfaces. In view of the initial value formulation for Einstein's equations, global hyperbolicity is seen to be a very natural condition in the context of general relativity, in the sense that given arbitrary initial data, there is a unique maximal globally hyperbolic solution of Einstein's equations.

Codd in 1979 and is the name given to a number of extensions to his original relational model (RM) published in 1970. The overall goal of the RM/T was to define some fundamental semantic units, at \\"atomic\\" and \\"molecular\\" levels, for data modelling. Codd writes: \\"the result is a model with a richer variety of objects than the original relational model, additional insert-update-delete rules and some additional operators that make the algebra more powerful.\\"  RM History  Between 1968 and 1988 Codd published over 30 papers on the relational model (RM) - the most famous of which is his 1970 paper. Up to 1978 the papers describe RM Version 1 (RM/V1). In early 1979 Codd first presented some new ideas, called RM/T ('T' for Tasmania), at an invited talk for the Australian Computer Science Conference in Hobart, Tasmania. Later that year the ACM journal published a paper on RM/T, in which Codd acknowledges the influence of Schmid & Swensen (1975) and Wiederhold (1977). A later version of RM/T (we shall call it here \\"RM/D\\") was described by Chris Date in Date (1983) in which Date and Codd improved and refined RM/T, adding an entity type called designative. Although Codd writes nothing about this new type, Date offers a rationale in Date (1983, page 262). Date revised this 1983 article in Date (1995), which additionally compares the RM/T model with the E/R model. Following a disappointing uptake of RM/T by the database industry, Codd decided to introduce the RM/T model more gradually. He planned to release a sequence of RM versions: RM/V2, RM/V3 etc. each time progressively including some of the ideas of the original RM/T into the new version. Perhaps this explains why there is no obvious mapping of concepts between RM/T and RM/V2. For example, there is no reference to associative or designative entity types in Codd's 1990 book that defines RM/V2. On the other hand, the book extends and builds on the existing body of query language issues, many of which were addressed by Codd in several papers throughout the 1980s.  Summary of RM/T  First we shall introduce some of the new concepts of RM/T: ;Surrogates: A surrogate is a unique value assigned to each entity. If two relations use the same surrogate value then they represent the same entity in the modelled universe. The surrogate value can be any unique string or number but cannot be assigned or changed by the database user. For example, a SQL SEQUENCE is often used to generate numerical surrogate values. This use of surrogate was first introduced in Hall, Owlett and Todd in 1976. ;Entities and Nonentities: An entity is some thing in the modelled universe and is typically identified by a surrogate. A nonentity is some thing that is not an entity and does not have its own identifying surrogate. An independent entity has its own surrogate. A dependent entity has a surrogate but it belongs to another entity, i.e. the surrogate is a foreign key. ;Atomic Semantics: The RM/T addresses atomic semantics by describing how the original RM relation can be used to describe entities with attributes. An entity is represented as an Entity-relation or E-relation and its attributes (or immediate properties) are stored in separate Property-relations or P-relations. Each E-relation shares its surrogate with the associated P-relations. :;E-relations: Mark the existence of an entity. An E-relation is a relation (table) storing only the surrogates for a particular entity type. A surrogate value entered into the E-relation table implies the corresponding existence of an entity of that type in the modelled world. For example, the E-relation \\"Employee\\" is a table containing the surrogates of all entities of type Employee. :;P-relations: Store the attribute values of an entity. A P-relation is a relation (table) storing the surrogate and one or more attributes of an entity. The surrogate value of a P-relation is that of the corresponding E-relation; it plays the role (K-role) of the primary key for that P-relation. For example, the P-relation \\"Employee_Number\\" is a table with two columns: one containing the surrogate value of the \\"Employee\\" E-relation, the other containing the employee number. :Note that by performing an OUTER NATURAL JOIN on the RM/T \\"Employee\\" E-relation and \\"Employee_Person\\" P-relation we can construct the RM/V1 \\"Employee\\" relation. This illustrates why the E-relation and P-relation concepts of RM/T are more atomic than the relation concept of RM/V1. ;Molecular Semantics: The RM/T addresses molecular semantics by taking the original RM and categorising the relations into several entity types, increasing the information captured by the semantic data model. However Codd does not define a notation for diagramming his new semantics. Each entity may play several roles at once and thus belong to one or more of the following entity types: :*Characteristic ‚Äì subordinate entities that describe kernel entities. :*Associative ‚Äì superordinate entities that interrelate kernel entities. :*Kernel ‚Äì entities that are neither characteristic or associative. :Codd goes on to introduce subtyping of entities, giving yet another qualifier for entities: :*Inner ‚Äì entities that are not subtypes of another entity. :Hence Codd speaks of inner kernel and inner associative entities. :The following definition is based on the RM/D model in Date (1983); it does not appear in Codd (1979): :*Designative ‚Äì entities that contain a designation. A designative entity is at the many end of a one-to-many relationship between two independent entities. For example, a writer may write many books, hence a one-to-many relationship between writer and book entities; the book is the designative entity because it contains a designation (or designative reference) to the writer - namely the primary key of the writer entity. Note that an associative entity contains at least two designations. For example, we can regard a booking as either an entity that associates a person with a flight, or as an entity that designates a person and designates a flight. Hence a designative entity must contain at least one designation whereas an associative entity must contain at least two designations. ;Associations: These are what we might otherwise call relationships between entities or non-entities. :The value E-null is used when deleteting entities from the RM/T model; all associations that have surrogates referring to a non-existing entity are assigned the value E-null, meaning the entity is unknown. ;Associative Entity and Nonentity Association: An associative entity is an entity that represents an association between two independent entities; the associative entity is an entity in itself because it has a surrogate. A nonentity association is similar to an associative entity however it has no surrogate. This lack of a surrogate stops the nonentity association from having, for example, any descriptive characteristic entities. ;Directed Graph Relations: Several directed graph relations are defined to capture further semantic features of the RM/T model. These graphs are named as follows: :*PG-relation (Property Graph) stores property relationships :*CG- relation (Characteristic Graph) stores characteristic relationships :*AG- relation (Association Graph) stores association relationships :*UGI-relation (Unconditional Generalisation by Inclusion) stores generalisation by inclusion relationships :*AGI-relation (Alternative Generalisation by Inclusion) stores generalisation by alternative relationships :*US-relation (Unconditional Successor) stores unconditional successor relationships :*AS-relation (Alternative Successor) stores alternative successor relationships :*KG- relation (Cover Membership) stores cover membership relationships :*UP- relation (Unconditional Precedence) stores unconditional succession of event relationships :*AP-relation (Alternative Precedence) stores alternative succession of event relationships ;RM/T Catalog: The Catalog is a meta-model storing the descriptions of the relations themselves. The RM/T Catalog comprises the following relations: :*CATR (R-surrogate, relname, RelType) describes relations :*CATRA (RA-surrogate, R-surrogate, A-surrogate) relates relations and attributes :*CATA (A-surrogate, attname, UserKey) describes attributes :*CATAD (AD-surrogate, A-surrogate, D-surrogate) relates attributes and domains :*CATD (D-surrogate, domname, VType, Ordering) describes domains :*CATC (C-surrogate, pername) describes categories :*CATRC (RC-surrogate, R-surrogate, C-surrogate) relates relations and categories :where :*relname is the textual name of a relation. e.g. \\"Address\\" :*attname is the textual name of an attribute. e.g. \\"Street\\" :*domname is the textual name of a domain. e.g. \\"Salary\\" :*pername is the category label (from the PER-domain) :*RN-domain is the domain of all relnames in the database :*PER-domain is the domain of all category labels :*E-domain is the domain of all surrogates in the database :*E-attribute is any attribute that plays the role of a surrogate (from the E-domain) :*E-null is the \\"entity unknown\\" surrogate (from the E-domain) :*R-surrogate is the relation surrogate (from the E-domain) :*A-surrogate is the attribute surrogate (from the E-domain) :*D-surrogate is the domain surrogate (from the E-domain) :*C-surrogate is the category label surrogate (from the E-domain) :*RA-surrogate is the relation-attribute surrogate (from the E-domain) :*AD-surrogate is the attribute-domain surrogate (from the E-domain) :*RC-surrogate is the relation-category-label surrogate (from the E-domain) :*RelType is the type of object represented by the relation :*UserKey shows whether the attribute participates in a user-defined key :*VType is the syntactic type of the value :*Ordering shows whether the operator > is applicable between values of the domain ;Operators: Numerous operators are defined on names, sets and graphs. See Codd's 1979 paper for details.  RM/T Today  There is little mention of RM/T today and no articles have appeared recently. Peckam and Maryanski (1988) wrote about RM/T in their study of semantic data models. Codd published his book in 1990 but wrote nothing more about RM/T. RM/V1 and RM/V2 have a chapter each in Date and Darwen (1992) and the Date (1983) article was updated in (1995) and now contains a long overdue comparison of the E/R model and RM/T. Date's most recent reflections can be found on the Web at Date (1999), The Database Relational Model (2001) and Date on RM/T (2003). RM/T contributed to the body of knowledge called semantic data modeling and semantic object modeling and continues to influence new data modellers.

The Carers National Strategy document \\"Caring about Carers\\", published on 8 February 1999 highlighted the need for legislation to enable local Councils with social service responsibilities to provide services direct to carers. 2\\\\. The Government's aim is to support carers in their caring roles and to help them maintain their own health and well-being. 3\\\\. To meet these aims the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 that came into force on 1 April 2001 gives local councils the power to supply certain services direct to carers following assessment. There is also a new right to a carer's assessment even where the person cared for has refused an assessment for, or the provision of, community care services. 4\\\\. Persons with parental responsibility for a disabled child (parents or other carers) also have a right to ask for an assessment. 5\\\\. The Government has given local councils the power to make direct payments to carers (including 16- and 17-year-old carers receiving support under the Act) to meet their own assessed needs. 6\\\\. Local councils may also make direct payments to parents of a disabled child to purchase services to meet the assessed needs of the disabled child and family. In addition councils may make direct payments to 16- and 17-year-old disabled young people. Direct payments to adolescents The Government's aim in extending direct payments to disabled young people age 16 and 17. 1\\\\. Direct payments are able to bring about improvements in the quality of life of people who would like to manage their own social services support. They promote independence, and aid social inclusion by offering opportunities for education, leisure and employment. 2\\\\. As part of the transition from childhood to adulthood, direct payments provide opportunities for disabled young people who want to develop management skills that will help them make decisions about how their assessed need for support will be met, both in the immediate and long-term future. Direct payments for young disabled people Important issues for consideration when offering a direct payment to a young disabled person 1\\\\. For any young person (with or without an impairment) the process of growing up involves the gradual taking on of more and more responsibility for himself or herself. As part of the transition to adulthood, some young people may wish to have a direct payment to manage parts or all of the elements of their care package to improve how their care package is delivered. 2\\\\. Issues for local councils to consider when planning services in partnership with parents and children remain the same when direct payments are being discussed: the family is the natural and most appropriate place for children, Local councils work in partnership with parents, while recognising that children are individuals with their own wishes and feelings. 3\\\\. In making decisions about direct payments to 16- and 17-year-old disabled young people the council should balance, as they do now (in relation to providing services) the young person's wishes and feelings and the views of those with parental responsibility. The overriding requirement is that the intervention of the local council, whether by providing a service or a direct payment, should promote and safeguard the welfare of the young person. 4\\\\. Where there is a difference of views between parents and disabled children age 16 and 17 and provided that the children have sufficient understanding to make informed decisions local councils should give precedence to their views. It follows that there may be situations where it would be right for a young person to receive a direct payment whether the parents agree or not. 5\\\\. There will also be situations where a disabled young person will express a wish to manage a direct payment but it is apparent to their parents and to the local council that they do not, at the moment, have the capacity to exercise this level of control in a way that will promote their welfare.

It is situated on the A371 road in the valley of the River Sheppey. Croscombe has a village hall, a shop, a public house, a Church, a chapel and a school. History North-east of the village and within the parish boundary is Maesbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort. It was first recorded in 706 when King Ine of Wessex referred to the village as Correges Cumb. The parish of Croscombe was part of the Whitstone Hundred. Croscombe emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries with a boom in the wool trade. During this period many houses, cottages and hostelries were built and the church was reconstructed. During the Industrial Revolution, silk, mining, quarrying and milling replaced the wool trade. In 1848 the River Sheppey powered two mills for grinding corn, one for winding silk, and another used as a stocking manufactory. The Old Manor was built around 1460‚Äì89 as a rectorial manor house for Hugh Sugar, the Treasurer of Wells Cathedral. It was altered in the 16th and 18th centuries, and in the 20th century by the Landmark Trust. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The village cross was put in place in the 19th century, replacing an older one which had been there since the 14th century. It is heavily weathered (the rock type is oolite - a soft limestone), especially on the front right where it serves as a seat for patrons of the adjacent public house now known as 'The Cross' bed and breakfast. In August 1861 the local waywardens decided that the village cross was a hindrance to the public way and endeavoured to remove it. The villagers were much against this and when masons from a neighbouring city began the act of despoiling it, the villagers gathered around the cross in its defence and a melee ensued involving both men and women inhabitants. The demolishing party were eventually driven off but not before the shaft had been broken and its finial broken in two. A flag was hoisted by the villagers bearing upon it the legend \\"Be Faithful\\" . During that night around 30 villagers volunteered to bivouac around the cross to guard it during the night. No other attempt has been made to remove the cross since. The village's public house is The George Inn. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny.

Religious sites St Mary's Church Croscombe Interior of St Mary's Church The large Church of St Mary the Virgin is of particular interest, having an unusual spire for Somerset, and Jacobean interior woodwork of national renown. It is primarily from the 15th and 16th centuries with 19th-century restoration. It includes a peal of six bells, the earliest dated 1613, and an organ from 1837. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The Old Rectory (also known as Parsonage House) was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in the 18th. It is a Grade II listed building. In 2014 it was announced by the Church Commissioners that the house would be purchased, for ¬£900,000 as a residence for Peter Hancock the incoming Bishop of Bath and Wells as an alternative to living at the traditional Bishop's Palace in Wells, to provide him with more privacy. This proposition was strongly opposed by the populace and eventually abandoned. The rectory was resold.

The house was altered in 1667 for Christopher Coward; and given a new facade and rearranged internally in 1864‚Äì68, probably by James Piers St Aubyn for Rev. William Leir. The exterior is now mostly his Victorian neo-Tudor; inside there are reused fragments and some original 15th- and 17th-century work ‚Äì coffered ceilings and the arch- braced roof of the ‚Äòchapel wing‚Äô, but most of the elaborate Gothic work dates from the 1860s.

Routes and Service  Service was provided to: Bertrand Island Amusement Park at Lake Hopatcong, Ledgewood, Succasunna, Kenvil, Mine Hill, Dover, Wharton, Rockaway Borough, Denville, Mountain Lakes, Boonton, Morris Plains (including Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital), Morristown, Madison, Chatham, Summit, Irvington, Elizabeth, and Newark, a distance of about 75 miles. The line ran on both exclusive right-of-way and on city streets, some of which, such as Broad Street in Summit, were designed and built to accommodate the trolley line. The power house for the trolley was located along the Passaic River in Summit, on the border of Chatham, New Jersey. Buses and private automobiles proved to be too much competition for the trolley lines, and the trolley cars were replaced with buses between 1926 and 1928.A History of Transit In Morris County , accessed November 29, 2006  Modern remnants  A two mile portion of the former Morris County Traction Company trolley line, along New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex line in Morris Township, New Jersey, now serves as a bike and walking trail called the Traction Line Recreation Trail, under the supervision of the Morris County Park System.Traction Line Recreation Trail , accessed November 29, 2006 In Union, a portion of the line forked off of Morris Avenue. Part of the right of way and partial grading is very noticeable behind Holy Spirit Church. Huguenot Avenue and Euclid Avenues have the same compass orientation as this portion of the line. The Summit car barn was still in existence as of November 2008. The building was located on River Road in Summit, just north of the intersection with Chatham Road. A turntable was visible between the Passaic River and the building. The building, then vacant, had been a car dealership, and earlier, a Public Service Coordinated Transport bus servicing facility for the number 70 and 72 routes. These routes replaced the MCTC lines when PS assumed the routes in the late 1920s. The bridge over the Passaic River between Chatham and Summit is gone, but the piers still stand in the river.

They typically offer services such as finding a particular used car model to fit a budget, getting the lowest price on a new car, or negotiating with a used car seller on behalf of a client that already located the car by themselves.  History  There have been car brokers operating in Australia almost as long as there have been car dealers. Car dealers recognised that some individuals stood out in their circle of friends or community as experts on car buying. The dealers started offering them a spotters fee each time they would bring a customer to the dealership. If the customer bought the car, the broker (or spotter) would be paid. After some time, a business model evolved where businesses would set up and call themselves motor brokers. Motor brokers would typically be started by car sales people who wanted a change of lifestyle. They were almost exclusively one-person operations, and operated as de facto car dealers. They would be licensed as car dealers, and fous on achieving the best bottom line deal for the customer. As the popularity of the Internet increased, the first pure online car brokers appeared around 2003. These car brokers are typified by the lack of a dealer's license, and only dealing in new cars. This minimises the labour component of the business and allows a high level of automation. In spite of car brokers having been in existence for decades, general public awareness of them in Australia is relatively limited.  Buying new cars  Car brokers work with their own established network of new car dealerships. When a client requires a new car, the car broker will contact one or more dealers in their network and determine which one will provide the required car at the lowest price. Delivery and location parameters may also be considered. Some car brokers offer to deliver the car to the client's home or place of work  Buying used cars  Some car brokers can help source used cars as well as new ones. In many of these cases, the car broker will buy the car and then sell it to their client. Used car brokers are generally licensed. The reasons for having a dealer's license are: * The car may be bought at an auction where private sellers cannot bid. * The car may be sourced from a private seller, but the buyer must purchase from a licensed dealer due to financing requirements. * Clients often prefer buying from a licensed dealer as statutory warranties apply in most cases. Many clients buy used cars via brokers without first seeing the car.  Other services  Other services provided by car brokers can include: * Test drives. Using a car broker to arrange test drives removes the often stressful situation of having to go to a dealership and be subjected to a sales pitch while trying to evaluate a car. * Financing. Typically, a finance broker will be aligned with the car broker to source discounted finance. * Pre-approved finance. * Cars are one of the most expensive depreciating assets people buy in their lives. It's a right of passage to adulthood when a person buys their first car, but many younger people can not usually afford a car. That's why people approach car financiers. Car Financiers lend money to allow accepted clients to purchase their next car sooner than they otherwise would, and work with the client to create a repayment plan.

Regulations  Many car brokers disclose their referral fee (also called dealer fee) on their websites. These referral fees are usually minimal amounts also known as \\"spotter fees\\" and as dealers are not having to pay for extra advertising or staff costs they welcome the extra volume orders from their regular brokers.  Alternatives  With the Internet's popularity ever increasing car brokers are becoming less common. Today we see more online classifieds/broker type systems. Online web applications have almost completely replaced the broker. And broker fees have become listing fees, with some sites also charging a spotters fee when the deal has been sealed.

Developed by former TCM marketing director Eric Weber, it was originally hosted by industrial rock/heavy metal musician and independent filmmaker Rob Zombie. The movies were programmed by Eric Weber until 2007, when TCM programmer Millie De Chirico took over the role. The series was launched in an attempt to attract more young viewers to Turner's older-skewing audience.Dempsey, John. \\"TCM digs deep for database\\". Variety. 2005-10-23. URL retrieved 2006-12-02.

History The parish of Doulting was part of the Whitstone Hundred. The parish includes the village of Bodden, which was founded in 1541 by Earl Michael Bodden (1512-1569). Notable former residents include Trish Bodden (1753-1777), who disguised herself as a man to fight in the American War of Independence (she was killed at Saratoga), and Amrose Bowden (sic), the first English colonist to settle in Maine.Bodden Family Crest Also a part of the parish is Prestleigh which was on the former Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The viaduct that carried it over the village was demolished in 1996; the railway itself had been out of use for a number of years before this. There is one pub in the village, the Prestleigh Inn. Doulting village dates from the 8th century when King Ine of Wessex gave the local estate to Glastonbury Abbey after his nephew St Aldhelm died in the village in 709.Powicke, Sir F. Maurice (editor) [1939] (1961). Handbook of British Chronology, p. 254. London: The Royal Historical Society. In his honour the local spring which is the source of the River Sheppey is called St Aldhelm's Well. The well head was built in the late 19th century and incorporates a wrought-iron pump handle. It is marked with a cast-iron plate with raised initials: \\"W.N.F.M.\\", and an additional brass memorial plaque dating from 1976. Folklore has attributed healing powers to the water from the well. The poet John Edmund Reade went to school in Doulting, and later wrote a poem about a return visit there, called 'Lines upon Doulting Sheep-slate', a \\"sheep-slate\\" being a piece of pasture used for grazing sheep. In it he says that: Grey Doulting's spire above the waste a sheeted spectre rose; And Mendip's bleak and barren heights again enclosed me round, Like faces of forgotten friends met on forgotten ground. The tithe barn at the southern end of the village dates from the 15th century and was used to store tithes, from the local farmers to the ecclesiastical landlord at Glastonbury Abbey. Around the village there are some extensive quarries of freestone, from which Wells Cathedral and later additions to Glastonbury Abbey and other churches were built. Doulting Stone Quarry has been producing stone since Roman times. Until 1994 it was operated by Amalgamated Roadstone Corporation (part of Hanson plc since 1989), at which time the landowner terminated the tenancy and now operates the quarry as an independent business. The stone is oolite of middle Jurassic age deposited as sediments in fairly shallow coastal seas. The heritage East Somerset Railway runs just to the south of the village, and terminates at the Mendip Vale railway station. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non- metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Wells county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Religious sites St Aldhelm's church The parish church is also dedicated to St Aldhelm and dates from the 12th century. It is a Grade I listed building, and has a tall spire rather than the towers which are more usual in Somerset. It has a two-storey porch which incorporates a carving of the Green Man into its vaulting. The local primary school is dedicated to St Aldhelm as well.

It inhabits the Centre Hills and South Soufriere Hills Important Bird Areas on the island of Montserrat in the Lesser Antilles of the West Indies, and is the national bird of this British territory. It is threatened by habitat loss, and was classified by BirdLife International as Critically Endangered, with a current estimated population of between 200 and 800. Much of its habitat was destroyed by deforestation, Hurricane Hugo and the volcanic activity between 1995 and 1997. However, a reduction in volcanic activity on the island has allowed the population of the Montserrat Oriole to rebound. As a result, the bird has been reclassified to the status of Vulnerable. Female at Frankfurt Zoo, Germany The oriole once was found in three main areas: the bamboo forest east of Galways Soufri√®re, the leeward slopes of the Chances Peak mountain and the Centre Hills (especially the Runaway Ghaut area). The diet of the bird consists mainly of insects and fruits. The birds usually lay two spotted eggs. All models indicate that they begin breeding at the age of one year. Most of them were almost wiped out during the volcano eruptions and only about 200 of them are still surviving. The binomial name of this bird commemorates the American naturalist Frederick Albion Ober. Description Among the Caribbean members of the genus Icterus, Montserrat Oriole is the only one that shows substantial sexual dimorphism in plumage coloration. The male Montserrat Oriole has a full black hood, with black eye and silver-black bill. The black reaches to the middle of the breast, leaving the appearance of a small yellow spur near the wing. The wings are all black with no wing bars and the tail is all black as well. The belly, flanks and rump are rich yellowish-orange. The legs are blackish gray. The female Montserrat Oriole has an overall greenish olive drab appearance. The head has a greenish yellow appearance, with the back and tail being more green. The wings are greenish brown with a yellow leading edge. The belly, flanks, breast and throat are a uniform greenish yellow. Juveniles are very similar to females, but have an overall duller appearance.Oppel, S., A. Cassini, J. Daley, and C. Fenton (2012). Montserrat Oriole (Icterus oberi), version 1.0. In Neotropical Birds Online (T. S. Schulenberg, Editor). Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.2173/nb.monori1.01 Habitat Historically A forest and edge species, the Montserrat oriole probably occurred throughout the main hill ranges prior to anthropogenic forest clearance. The Montserrat oriole is believed to have formerly had a total range of around 30 square kilometres. In the lowlands, it probably occurred in the wetter forests of the west and south of the island, particularly along the steep river valleys, known locally as ghauts. Most forest habitat, including the hill forests, was destroyed by clearance for plantation agriculture during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Beard, 1949). However, with the decline of the plantations, secondary forest developed over most of the hill ranges.Hilton, Geoff, et al. ‚ÄúRapid Decline of the Volcanically Threatened Montserrat Oriole.‚Äù Biological Conservation , vol. 111, 2003, pp. 79‚Äì89. Present day Today, the Montserrat Oriole inhabits mesic to wet neotropical forests, and these forests are now restricted to two areas of the island: the Centre Hills (1110 ha) and the South Soufriere Hills (250 ha). It formerly occurred across the island's three main forested hill ranges (the Centre, Soufri√®re and South Soufri√®re hills), and has also been observed in agricultural and residential areas of lowland Montserrat, but this is likely due to individuals wandering from core population areas. Today, the Montserrat Oriole is confined to hill forests on the small island of Montserrat. However, volcanic eruptions between 1995 and 1997 destroyed around two-thirds of its habitat, all but removing this species from the Soufri√®re and South Soufri√®re hills, and largely restricting it to just the Centre Hills. In total, the Montserrat oriole is thought to presently occupy an area of less than 13 square kilometres. Behavior Because of the small range of this species, information relating to their behavior is limited. What we do know, is that the bird tends to move around the forest solitarily, or frequently in pairs. The extent of daily movements and home range size unknown, but believed to exceed radius of 50 m. There is evidence that seasonal movements to higher elevation may occur, especially during dry season when the forest at higher elevations retains some moisture offers more food. Orioles can be inquisitive and will frequently approach humans, but they can also be shy and inconspicuous and are easily overlooked. Because the species has few natural predators, no predator-avoidance behavior is known. However, Pearly-eyed Thrashers (Margarops fuscatus) are aggressive competitors at fruiting trees, and may be potential predators of young and possibly adult orioles. In the presence of Pearly-eyed Thrashers, Montserrat Orioles often reduce vocalizations and become more secretive. Voice The Montserrat Orioles song is a loud series of melodious whistles, but slow and methodical. Single notes given are given every 2 ‚Äì 3 seconds. Notes are composed of single syllables, or two syllables, usually short, sharp whistles or lower pitched gurgled whistles. One predominant note is a sharply descending whistled 'tseew'. The song is mostly heard during breeding season, but does not sing consistently at high rate. Both sexes can produce song. The sound of the call is similar to other orioles, a harsh and sharp chic or chuck note, often repeated incessantly when bird is alarmed. It is said that the call is the easiest way to detect the presence of this species. Feeding Like the behavioral data, limited information exists on the feeding habits of the Montserrat Oriole. Research we do have suggests that the Montserrat Oriole has a varied diet that consists of Arthropods (insects, spiders), snails, and to a lesser extent fruits, and possibly nectar and flowers. Foraging occurs frequently in flowers, and it is likely that both nectar and associated arthropods are being consumed. Larvae of aquatic and semi-aquatic invertebrates that are found in water-filled Heliconia floral bracts presumably are an important diet item. Wild individuals have been observed to consume mango (Mangifera indica); captive individuals have consumed kiwifruit (Actinidia) and papaya (Carica). Foraging behavior The oriole forages mostly in pairs. It uses a strong bill to pry bark and leaf-stems open to extract arthropods, but also gleans arthropods from foliage. When foraging on flowers, it relies on eyesight to obtain invertebrates. Prey items that are too large for immediate ingestion are held with claws and manipulated with the beak while the bird is perched on a branch. Although fly-catching has been observed, leaf-gleaning is the more dominant mode of foraging. Frequently, orioles search hanging dead leaves, vine tangles, and leaf covered branches for arthropods. Measurements MALE (n = 37 individuals): tarsus length: 22.0 mm (25.8; range 24.9-26.4); body mass: 36.6 g 38.0, range 36.0-39.0). FEMALE (n = 11 individuals): tarsus length: 20.9 mm (24.3, range 22.0-27.2); body mass: 33.6 g (33.7, range 31.5-35.4). JUVENILE (n = 25 individuals of both sexes): tarsus length: 20.9 mm; body mass: 34.3 g. Population In 1984, Arendt and Arendt estimated that about 1000-1200 Montserrat Orioles were present on the island, but that number was likely an underestimate (Evans 1990). Initial surveys suggested that much of the population had survived the eruptions, with healthy numbers remaining in the Centre Hills and a smaller relict population in the South Soufri√®re hills. These surveys were confirmed by scientists publishing in the journal Bird Conservation International who extrapolated that the population must contain around 4,000 individuals.Arendt, W., Gibbons, D., & Gray, G. (1999). Status of the volcanically threatened Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi and other forest birds in Montserrat, West Indies. Bird Conservation International, 9(4), 351-372. doi:10.1017/S095927090000352X But between 1997 and 2003, the population declined very rapidly. Thankfully, later surveys discovered a remnant population occupying an area of just one to two square kilometres in the South Soufri√®re hills. Since 2010 there has been a reduction in volcanic activity, and improved efforts in surveying since 2011 have shown that the oriole's population is currently stable or mildly increasing.Hurrell, Shaun, and Sarah Sarah Harvey. ‚ÄúThe Montserrat Oriole Is No Longer Critically Endangered.‚Äù BirdLife Internationals: Americas, BirdLife International, 20 Jan. 2017, www.birdlife.org/americas/news/montserrat-oriole-no-longer- critically-endangered. In 2012, abundance estimates derived from repeated point counts coupled with the assumption of birds using a 100 m radius of forest around each sampling station yielded a total population estimate of 765 birds (95% CI: 492 - 1345), with 540 birds (95% CI: 377 - 902) in the Centre Hills and 225 birds (95% CI: 115 - 442) in the South Soufriere Hills. Effects of human activity on population The direct effects of human activities on the Montserrat Oriole's population currently are low. However, the conversion of forest habitat to housing and agricultural plantations in the past has severely reduced the extent of suitable forest habitat on the island of Montserrat. Ongoing housing developments may encroach on the margins of the protected Centre Hills forest, and lead to further, albeit very small, loss of forest habitat. Conservation status Multiple zoological expeditions have brought individuals for conservation in the last thirty years. Back in the late 1990s, the RSPB worked with international partners, notably Durrell Wildlife and the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, to mount a rescue of some orioles into ex situ care, ensuring the species was not lost forever. In 1999, at the height of the volcanic eruption, some birds were also taken into captivity to safeguard the species against extinction in the wild. Captive breeding at Jersey Zoo (UK) was successful, and in February 2012 there were 48 individual birds alive in 14 different zoos. Due to persistent threats in the only remaining wild habitats, captive population may have to be maintained for the next 25 years. Threats No information exists on predation on adult birds. Eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation by introduced mammals (rats, mostly Rattus rattus) and native birds (Pearly-eyed Thrashers, Margarops fuscatus). Pearly-eyed Thrashers are opportunistic omnivores, and occasionally pursue adult or immature orioles, but it is unlikely that such attempts are successful. All birds of prey that regularly occur on Montserrat are mostly associated with open habitats, and are therefore unlikely predators of Montserrat Orioles. American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) occasionally hunt in forest habitat, but it is unknown whether they prey on orioles. Its populations are also at risk of further volcanic eruptions, as well as other natural destructive events, such as hurricanes, which are a frequent disturbance in the Caribbean region. Invasive animals Non-native mammals such as rats (Rattus rattus and R. norvegicus), pigs (Sus scrofa), and goats (Caprus hirca) are abundant and widespread in the forests on Montserrat. Rats act as nest predators and kill both eggs and chicks. Pigs and goats affect the forest undergrowth and alter the structure of the forest vegetation, which may reduce the availability of optimal nesting habitat. Pigs also uproot Heliconia plants, which are an important foraging substrate for Montserrat Orioles. Territoriality The Montserrat Oriole defends territory aggressively against conspecific intruders during the breeding season. Although birds are present in territories year-round, territories appear to be less important outside the main breeding season, and the territorial response can be much reduced or completely lacking. Offspring are tolerated in territories for up to 3 months, but length of post fledging care and tolerance depends on the re-nesting decision of the territorial pair. Inter-specific aggression is rare. Orioles sometimes displace smaller forest bird species from Heliconia flowers in the process of foraging. Occasionally, territorial adults defend flowering trees and aggressively chase off both conspecifics and other bird species. Reproduction The Montserrat Oriole has a smaller clutch, more extended parental care, and higher adult survival than most orioles nesting in the North Temperate Zone. A clutch of usually two or three eggs is laid with an average annual productivity of 1 fledged chick per pair, and successful pairs may occasionally rear up to three broods per year. Unsuccessful pairs may attempt up to five clutches in a single season. Incubation duties, which may be shared equally by both parents or have little input from the male, usually last for around 14 days. Both adults feed the chicks for the 13 days that they are in the nest, with an average of 40 days taken for post-fledgling parental care. However, this relationship will not last much longer than three months. Reproductive investment Montserrat Orioles are multiple-brooded, and can lay up to five clutches per season when some of these nests fail, and raise a maximum of three broods per year. No information exists about the factors controlling the cessation of breeding activity, but last clutches are generally initiated before the end of August. In each year, a small number of pairs may occupy territories and construct nests without attempting to lay eggs. After nest failure, new clutches are generally laid within 3 weeks, whereas after successfully raising a brood a new clutch is generally initiated within 5 weeks. Sexual behavior The social system of the Montserrat Oriole is characterized by social monogamy and high mate fidelity. Pairs occur in breeding territories year-round, and show strong fidelity to the nesting territory in successive years. Divorce of partners is uncommon, but does occur. In most cases, the female retains control over the breeding territory. Phenology Montserrat Orioles breed mostly between late March and September, coinciding with the peak rainfall season on Montserrat. The lay date of first clutches is around mid April (¬± 30 days). A single active nest was found in January 1999 and recently fledged juveniles were observed in December 2004, but such unseasonal nesting events are rare. Demographics Adult survival is higher in Montserrat Orioles than for temperate orioles, and ranges from 60-76% per year (Allcorn et al. 2012). There appears to be substantial annual variation in adult survival, which is likely a consequence of environmental conditions. In years when a volcanic dome collapse led to heavy ash fall over existing forest areas, adult survival was reduced compared to years when no ash fall occurred. This reduction is presumably a result of food shortage, as the volcanic ash suppresses insect availability (Marske et al. 2007). Rainfall, which may also affect the availability of food, has a comparatively minor influence on adult survival. Because of the high adult survival, Montserrat Orioles are long-lived birds and population dynamics depend heavily on adult survival and to a smaller extent on juvenile survival and recruitment. Although nesting success is low, it is possible that Montserrat Orioles could maintain stable populations if re-nesting and long parental care of fledglings compensate for the high mortality of eggs and chicks. Nesting Construction characteristics The Montserrat Oriole nests are a hanging basket structure sewn onto the underside of horizontal leaves or leaf clusters, which is typical for the genus. The nest is built entirely by the female. Males indicate potential nest sites to their mates by hanging upside down from the underside of chosen leaves. The female begins building the basket by shredding strands out of the leaf frond. These form the \\"ribs\\" of the structure, and the female oriole then weaves the basket around these ribs with fine strands of vegetation obtained from Heliconia and other forest plants. Nests are typically constructed 1.5 ‚Äì 20 m above the ground, with nests in Heliconia usually around 3‚Äì4 m, and nests in woody tree species higher above ground. Nests are not conspicuously lined. Heliconia leaves are the most commonly used nest substrate (83% of 229 nests) at present, but because Heliconia is an early successional plant that has benefited from human forest modification and hurricanes, this apparent preference may be fairly recent. Alternative nest substrates are leaves of banana (Musa acuminata), Cordia sulcata, Cecropia spp., and Coccoloba spp. These broad leaves provide shelter from heavy rainfall events, which are common during the breeding season.Richard I. Allcorn, Geoff M. Hilton, Calvin Fenton, Phil W. Atkinson, Christopher G. R. Bowden, Gerard A. L. Gray, Mark Hulme, Joah Madden, Elizabeth K. Mackley, Steffen Oppel, Demography and Breeding Ecology of the Critically Endangered Montserrat Oriole, The Condor: Ornithological Applications, Volume 114, Issue 1, 1 February 2012, Pages 227‚Äì235, https://doi.org/10.1525/cond.2011.110033 Nesting period Eggs are laid in daily intervals, and incubation commences once the clutch is complete. Only the female incubates. The male remains generally within sight of the nest and responds aggressively to both intra- and interspecific intrusion into the nest's vicinity throughout the incubation period. Mean length of incubation is 13.9 ¬± 0.2 days (n = 70 nests). Mean time from hatching to fledging is 13.1 ¬± 0.3 days (n = 56). Both parents feed nestlings, but no information exists on feeding rates and diet delivered to nestlings. Success rate Nesting success is generally low. Reproductive output averages slightly over one chick per pair per year, but is unequally distributed among pairs and varies substantially among years. Nest failures are mostly a result of nest predation, with smaller numbers of nests failing after ash fall or structural collapse of the nest-supporting leaves. Post- fledgling parental care Both parents share the duty of feeding fledglings. Mean length of post-fledging parental care is 40 ¬± 5 days (n = 35 broods), but parental care can be very long (up to 88 days after fledging). Parental care gradually diminishes over time after fledging, and can be 1‚Äì2 weeks shorter when the pair subsequently starts a new nest in the same season. Brood division is common in pairs that feed more than one fledgling, and each parent appears to preferentially feed one of the fledglings. The female provides most of the care for solitary fledglings. After about 55 days post-fledging, males start chasing fledglings to encourage them to leave their natal territory. Priorities for future research Currently no information exists on the survival and recruitment of juvenile birds. This critical parameter is important for the development of more precise population models that can predict the species' response to future climatic changes, and research is needed to describe juvenile movements and the range of survival probabilities among years with differing environmental conditions. Very little is known about the diet of Montserrat Oriole, and the role that dietary abundance plays in increasing reproductive output. Fecundity appears to increase with higher pre-breeding season rainfall, but a mechanistic link has not been established yet. Furthermore, no information currently exists on genetic bottleneck effects as a result of the dramatically reduced population size following the volcanic eruption. Work is ongoing to assess the genetic health of the species across temporal and spatial scales. Samples have been collected from the extant wild population, from captive birds, and from museum specimens, and will be analysed for genetic structure and overall diversity.

He is best remembered for having written the melody of the World War II classic \\"Lili Marleen\\", originally a poem from the 1915 book Die kleine Hafenorgel by Hans Leip. Other works were the operas Schwarzer Peter and Das kalte Herz, the musical K√§pt'n Bye-Bye, from which comes the evergreen \\"Nimm' mich mit, Kapit√§n, auf die Reise\\" (\\"Take me travelling, Captain\\"), as well as numerous films, such as ' (1955). Pseudonyms used by Schultze include Frank Norbert, Peter Kornfeld, and Henri Iversen. Life Schultze took the Abitur in Brunswick and went on to study piano, conducting, composing and theatre science in Cologne and Munich. He went to the Bavarian capital in the 1930s as a composer and worked under the name Frank Norbert as an actor in a student cabaret \\"Die Vier Nachrichter\\" (\\"The Four Reporters\\"). This was followed by 1932-34 involvement in Heidelberg and as a conductor in Darmstadt, Munich and Leipzig and Mannheim. The Third Reich After several projects as production manager at Telefunken, Schultze decided in 1936 to try his luck as a freelance composer for stage and film. He delivered a series of compositions for martial and propaganda songs and was advised to become a member of the National Socialist German Workers Party in 1940 in order not to be conscripted. In 1932 he married his first wife, the actress Vera Spohr, with whom he had four children. After his divorce in 1943 he married the Bulgarian actress, singer and writer Iwa Wanja, who contributed libretti to several of his stage works. They had two sons. On behalf of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels he created works such as \\"From Finland to the Black Sea\\", \\"the song of the Kleist tank group\\", \\"tanks roll in Africa\\" and \\"bombs on England\\". The popularity of these combat and soldier songs led Norbert Schultze to be continually in demand by National Socialist propaganda. He also wrote music for Veit Harlan's morale- boosting \\"hold out\\" film Kolberg, and the main theme of the war documentary Baptism of Fire (Feuertaufe). His subsequent comment regarding his war work was, \\"You know, I was at the best age for a soldier, 30 or so. For me the alternatives were: compose or croak. So I decided for the former.\\"\\"The 100 Greatest Braunschweiger\\", Braunschweiger Zeitung Special, Issue 1, 2005. Schultze was defined under denazification as a \\"fellow traveller\\", and on payment of a \\"processing fee\\" of 3,000 DM he got an immediate work permit. His songs being controlled to this day by GEMA (Germany), Schultze ordered that all of his royalties from 1933 to 1945 go to the German Red Cross as is the case to this day. Especially his song \\"Bomben auf Engeland\\" led to him being nicknamed \\"Bomben-Schultze\\" within Germany's writers of popular tunes in the war years. In a German speaking BBC documentary about artists working with Joseph Goebbels he claimed: \\"after writing the tune for national culture bombs on England I said to myself: Oh my god, what if the air-defence hits my relatives or friends. So naive I was.\\" Lili Marleen Schultze wrote the melody to \\"Lili Marleen\\" from the poem \\"Die kleine Hafenorgel\\" by Hans Leip. In 1990 he told BBC researcher Karen Liebreich that the tune was originally written for a toothpaste radio commercial. Sound recordings, first with a female singer Lale Andersen in 1939 at first sold little, but when the German military transmitter in Belgrade signed off with a recording from the singer several times, listeners' letters showed lively demand. The song met the inner mood of millions of soldiers of all armies who were fighting on both sides of the fronts and was translated into about fifty languages to become one of the global cultural \\"index fossils\\" of the Second World War. It was the first German million-seller. Post-war period Schultze remained true to his profession and wrote numerous operas, operettas (such as Rain in Paris), musicals, ballets (Struwwelpeter written pre-war during his time at Telefunken) and Max and Moritz (filmed 1956), music for more than 50 movies, and songs. He was from 1961 president of the Association of German stage writers and composers and from 1973 to 1991 was a board member of the German Composer Association. Until 1996, he held offices on the board of GEMA, the Board of Trustees of the Social Welfare Fund of GEMA and the supply Foundation of the German composers. His later life was spent with his third wife Brigitt Salvatori (married Easter 1992, in a ceremony performed by his daughter), mainly in Majorca but also often in Bavaria.

The hill fort is considered to be medieval as it is on the site of earlier earthwork. The parish of Downhead was part of the Whitstone Hundred. The village was recorded as Dunehevede, meaning the top of the down, in 1196. The manor was given to Glastonbury Abbey by King √Üthelwulf of Wessex, but by 1066 was held under the abbey by Erneis. By the early 18th century the estate was held by the Portmans of Orchard Portman. Downhead Basalt Quarry to the west of the village, opened before 1904 and ceased Basalt mining in 1925. It was serviced by a narrow gauge railway. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography It is close to the Asham Wood biological Site of Special Scientific Interest which is the largest and most diverse of the ancient semi- natural woods in the Mendip Hills. It has been the subject of controversy and attempts to protect the environment from increased quarrying activity in the area, particularly at Torr Works which is also known as Merehead Quarry. The wood occupies 2 deep valleys and the intervening plateau. Most of the underlying rocks are calcareous Carboniferous Limestone and Shales, but Devonian Portishead Beds outcrop along the northern valley. There are a range of unusual flora and fauna. Religious sites All Saints church is a Grade II* listed building with a 14th-century tower and 18th-century nave and chancel. The church tower contains three bells cast in 1782 by William Bilbie of Chew Stoke. In 2007 funding from the levy on nearby quarries was obtained to pay for repair and restoration work on the bells.

The work comprises an outline in the highly elliptical verse format typical of early Indian philosophical texts, and an explanatory auto- commentary. Content ;Chapter 1 :The treatise begins with DignƒÅga's assertion that there are only two means of knowledge: direct perception and inference. Corresponding to these we have two objects: particulars and universals.Direct perception is knowledge which excludes conceptual thought (kalpanƒÅ). This only reveals the bare features of an object via the senses. This knowledge is inexpressible in words, relating to real objects and ultimate reality. Errors of perception arise through misinterpretations by conceptual thought. Each item of sense perception is unique. DignƒÅga does not specify what the nature of the object of perception is, but implies that although it is not atomic or otherwise, it is existent. ;Chapter 2 :The second chapter concerns the \\"inference for oneself\\" ('). This is knowledge of what can be inferred through a middle term ('), which has the three characteristics for a valid middle term, namely, that it is concomitantly present in the thesis, present in a similar example and absent from a dissimilar example. According to DignƒÅga, inference only deals with universals and is always dependent upon the subject/object relation. ;Chapter 3 :The subject of this chapter is the \\"inference for other\\" ('), the process by which one makes public what one knows, by formal means, using a syllogistic means of argument. This typically takes the following form: ;Chapter 4 :DignƒÅga offers examples of how inferences are to be used and how to select relevant examples. In his method of syllogistic logic, agreeing and different examples are needed to establish concomitance of the middle term. ;Chapter 5 :DignƒÅga defines the \\"exclusion of other\\" (anya-apoha). Here, DignƒÅga first eliminates authority as a separate valid means of knowledge, stating that it is a kind of inference. Authority is acceptable only if it does not contradict one's own perception and inference. DignƒÅga states that conceptual knowledge derives from words, but asks what do words mean. He proposes that words express their meaning by exclusion of opposite meanings. Words do not denote real universals, as there is no necessary connection between words and universals. Instead, words only express imaginary concepts and vice versa. In DignƒÅga's view, words do not produce knowledge by referring to particular objects, but only demark X from non-X. That is, the word \\"white\\" does not bring about knowledge of all white objects, but only demarks white from non-white. In this way, some form of classification is possible in the mind through this process of distinctions. This is done by the internal application of agreement and difference, so he maintains that speech derives from inference. However, he adds the proviso that this process is aided by direct perception which helps avoid fallacies. Thus, the imagined world of universals can be made to fit the real world by correcting contradictions in the light of direct perception.

It was established in January 1660, and run by the Morita family of actors until its destruction in the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake which destroyed much of Tokyo. History The Morita-za was first built by Morita Tar≈çbei I and his son Morita Tashichi in 1660, in Edo's Kobiki-ch≈ç district. The theater would burn down only a few months later, and many more times over the years, but was always rebuilt (until 1923). It was designated as one of only four theaters allowed to operate in Edo, by a 1670 government edict; the other three officially designated theaters were the Nakamura-za, Ichimura-Takenoj≈ç-za, and Yamamura-za. After all four were destroyed in the 1703 Great Genroku fire, and rebuilt, there began a tradition of co-producing plays for New Year's celebrations. The Morita-za experienced great success for a time, and took part in a number of major events along with the other three top theaters; for example, in 1717, Chikamatsu's Battles of Coxinga, performed at the Morita-za and two other theaters, was the first instance of a bunraku puppet play being adapted to kabuki. However, in 1734, the Morita-za went bankrupt, and was forced to transfer the rights to its performances to another theatre, through the hikae yagura system. Kawarazaki Gonnosuke III of the Kawarazaki-za, took over the Morita-za's place as a designated theater for a decade or so. This relationship between the two theaters would continue through the Edo period, as the Morita-za went bankrupt numerous times in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Though on shaky ground in terms of financial stability, the Morita-za would see a great number of significant kabuki events over the following decades, including the introductory performances of many now-famous plays, and other such special occasions. In 1781, Ichikawa Danz≈ç IV, performing at the Morita-za, became the first performer to take on seven roles in the grand epic Chushingura (The Tale of the 47 Ronin). In 1858, after a number of closings and reopenings of the theater, the Morita-za opened once more, changing its name, however, from „ÄåÊ£ÆÁî∞Â∫ß„Äç to „ÄåÂÆàÁî∞Â∫ß„Äç (both are pronounced the same, as \\"Morita-za\\"). The character ÂÆà (mori) means \\"protection\\", and this change was perhaps made to seek better luck for the theater, and protection from fire and from bankruptcy. The theater would then be moved and rebuilt in 1872, leaving Saruwaka-ch≈ç for Shintomi-ch≈ç; the new building was larger, and had a few new features, such as indoor toilets and a seating section for foreigners. A few years later, in 1875, the theater was renamed Shintomi-za, after the district, in celebration and recognition of its becoming a stock company (sogo shosha). Though the theater would continue to be destroyed by fire, and to face financial difficulties, it continued to improve and to experiment. The Shintomi-za would be rebuilt bigger and better several times in the late 19th century, and experimented with new styles of productions. In September 1879, it premiered a play called Hy≈çry≈´ Kidan Seiy≈ç Kabuki (ÊºÇÊµÅÊ∞óÂõ£Ë•øÊ¥ãÊ≠åËàû‰ºé, \\"A strange story about drifters and Western Kabuki\\"); the story was one of Japanese exploring Europe and the United States, and featured a number of Western actors, and Italian- style arias. It was not well-received, and was a commercial failure in this first performance, but is representative of the kinds of experimentation and innovation that the Shintomi-za explored. Morita Kanya XII, then head of the theater (zamoto) was forced to hand over official management duties in 1894, due to financial problems, but stayed on as producer until his death three years later. In 1909, the theater was bought out by the Sh≈çchiku Corporation, though it continued to be managed by members of the Morita family. Finally, in 1923, the Great Kant≈ç earthquake destroyed much of the capital, including the Shintomi-za, which was never rebuilt.

MTV, the first and most popular music television network in the U.S., has come under criticism for alleged censorship in their programming. Throughout the decades, MTV has altered or removed shows from the channel's schedule to address complaints; and music videos have been censored, moved to late-night rotation, or banned from the channel's rotation for various types of controversial content.  Censorship in full-length programming  The hit show Jackass was subject to frequent censorship in the early 2000s. The popularity of the show, combined with the propensity of young viewers to attempt to imitate the show's risky stunts, led to substantial controversy. Although the show featured prominent warning messages at its start, end, and upon return from all commercial breaks urging viewers not to re-create any stunts seen on the program, nor submit footage to the network of those stunts for casting consideration on that or other MTV series, the show was nonetheless blamed for many injuries. In 2001, then-Senator Joe Lieberman urged Viacom to take more responsibility for the program's content; which led MTV to only air the show after 10p.m. The creators of Jackass expressed frustration over the restraints that MTV's producers imposed on stunts after Lieberman's statement. These limitations eventually led to the departure of several cast members, and to the conclusion of the show. MTV's influence also affected its famous animated program, Beavis and Butt-Head. In the wake of a controversy that followed a child burning down his house after allegedly watching the show, producers moved the show from its original 7p.m. time slot to a late-night, 11p.m. slot. Beavis' tendency to flick a lighter and scream the word \\"fire\\" was removed from new episodes, and controversial scenes were removed from existing episodes before rebroadcast.Censorship & Scandals: Beavis & Butt-head Some of the edits were so extensive that when series creator Mike Judge compiled his Collection DVDs he commented that \\"some of those episodes may not even exist actually in their original form\\". The Parents Television Council has argued that much of the censored material on MTV is easily discernible because of the context in which it is presented.  Censored music videos  MTV has frequently edited music videos to remove lyrical references to drugs, In this case, a reference to crack cocaine was removed from the video for \\"My Band\\" by D12. sex, nudity, violence, weapons, homophobia, suicide, religion or advertising, and completely edits out swear words. Usually, all racial slurs are censored on MTV music videos The report mentioned that \\"nigga\\" was censored out of the videos \\"Freak-a-Leek\\" by Petey Pablo (p. 6) and \\"My Band\\" by D12. (p. 8). and programming,Making the Band 2 Episode Summaries and MTV has emphasized racial tolerance for people of all races and creeds.MTV.com - think - Discrimination -> Racism Examples of lyric edits have included: * In the song \\"Beautiful Girls\\" by Sean Kingston, the word \\"suicidal\\" in the chorus was altered to \\"in denial\\". * In Michael Jackson's single \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", MTV has replaced the words \\"Jew me\\" and \\"kick me\\" with \\"do me\\" and \\"strike me\\" in the line \\"Jew me, sue me... kick me, kick me; don't you black or white me\\".Michael Jackson videography on JacksonAction.com Jackson later explained that the song used the words to describe prejudice and that it was poor judgment to select Jewish people as explanatory words. * \\"This Love\\" by Maroon 5 had the words \\"coming\\" and \\"sinking\\" muted out due to possible sexual connotations. * \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" by Foster the People was edited to remove references to the song's subject daring people to \\"outrun my gun\\" and to run \\"faster than my bullet\\". Videos moved to late-night or obscure rotation In attempt to address criticism over risqu√© content, MTV has sometimes moved certain videos to late-night rotation in censored format.  Sexual content  * \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\" by Cher was pushed to hours after 9p.m. due to the singer's revealing clothing.MTV * \\"Baby Got Back\\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot was aired only after 9p.m., due to its depictions of women's bodies. (The station had recently instated a policy against showing female body parts with no reference to a face.) * \\"Closer\\" by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails was heavily censored when aired on MTV due to sexually explicit imagery that contained a nude bald woman wearing a crucifix mask, NIN frontman Trent Reznor in bondage, and an image of a vulva, along with the song's notorious lyric \\"I wanna fuck you like an animal.\\" The objectionable content was replaced with a picture that said \\"scene missing\\". * The song \\"√âtienne\\" by Guesch Patti was moved to late-night rotation in MTV Europe in 1987 due to a striptease scene.\\"La Discoth√®que du 20√® si√®cle\\", 1988, Polygram Direct, p. 14 * In February 2004, following the controversial Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in which performer Justin Timberlake exposed the breast of co-performer Janet Jackson, MTV made several efforts to limit daytime rotation of music videos that could be perceived to have too much sexual content. Such videos included: ** \\"Hotel\\" by Cassidy ** \\"I Miss You\\" by Blink-182 ** \\"Salt Shaker\\" by Ying Yang Twins ** \\"Splash Waterfalls\\" by Ludacris ** \\"The Jump Off\\" by Lil' Kim ** \\"This Love\\" by Maroon 5 ** \\"Dirrty\\" by Christina Aguilera ** \\"Toxic\\" by Britney Spears  Misogyny  * \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\" by The Prodigy was initially given late-night rotation on MTV's 120 Minutes on December 7, 1997 due to a fistfight, sexual scenes and allegedly misogynistic language in the lyrics but was removed from rotation altogether after around two weeks, a decision supported by the feminist group National Organization for Women. In 2002, MTV2 showed this video in its special Most Controversial Videos.  Political content  * In 2002, only MTV2 would play the Public Enemy video \\"Gotta Give the Peeps What They Need\\", because it contained \\"free Mumia\\" in the lyrics. * In 2004, the video for \\"Megalomaniac\\" by Incubus was moved to late-night because of depictions of German leader Adolf Hitler and people drinking oil. * Also in 2004, alleged glorification of gun violence led MTV to play an edited version of the video \\"99 Problems\\" by Jay-Z between 6p.m. and 6a.m. only.  Foreign edits  * \\"Turn Me On\\" by Riton and Oliver Heldens featuring Vula - all shots where some doctors try to cut out a man's heart, along with the close-up of the man were replaced by completely different scenes due to violence. **This edit was made on MTV's sister channel MTV Hits. Banned music videos  From MTV in the United States  Several videos have been perceived as too controversial to play on MTV even in censored form, for varying reasons.

He worked in a combination of the Art Nouveau and Symbolist styles. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics.  Biography  His father was the Prussian statesman Karl von Hofmann, who served as Minister-president of the Grand Duchy of Hesse from 1872 to 1876 and was briefly Trade Minister in the cabinet of Otto von Bismarck. Ludwig began his studies in 1883 at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, then studied with Ferdinand Keller at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe. In 1889, he attended the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris, where he came under the influence of Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and Paul-Albert Besnard. After 1890, he was a freelance painter in Berlin. From 1894 to 1900, he travelled extensively and spent a great deal of his time at his villa in Fiesole. His appreciation of antiquity and attraction to the idea of Arcadia permeates much of his work. After 1895, he was a regular contributor of illustrations for the Art Nouveau magazine, Pan. In 1896, he became a member of the Berlin Secession and he was married in 1899. He was also a member of the Deutscher K√ºnstlerbund In 1903, he was appointed a Professor at the Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School, where he became a member of the avant-garde literary and artistic group centered around Harry Graf Kessler. Jean Arp and Ivo Hauptmann were among his students. In 1916, he was named a Professor at the Academy in Dresden, where he remained until 1931. He also provided illustrations for a new translation of the Odyssey by Leopold Ziegler and works by Gerhart Hauptmann (Ivo's father). His overall production slackened in the 1930s and, in 1937, some of his works were labeled as \\"degenerate art\\". He retired to Pillnitz, near Dresden, where he died in 1945. His remaining works were almost confiscated by the Russians after the war, but his widow managed to save them.

Making his professional debut in 1978, he reached the top division in 1983. In 1987 he won his first y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship with a perfect score and became the sport's 62nd yokozuna. However, he was able to win only one more championship before his retirement in 1991. He has remained in sumo as a coach and in 1999 became the head of Shibatayama stable. He was elected to the Japan Sumo Association's board of directors in 2018. His peak weight was 210 kg (463 lbs) in May 1989. Early life Aoki was born in Memuro Town, Kasai District, Tokachi, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. At school he did judo, but after a sumo tournament in the area, he was recruited to Hanakago stable by wrestler Kaiketsu Masateru and fought his first bout in March 1978 aged 15. When Kaiketsu set up his Hanaregoma stable in 1981, he took Aoki with him. Makuuchi He reached the second j≈´ry≈ç division in March 1982, and the top makuuchi division a year later in March 1983. He made his san'yaku debut at komusubi just three tournaments later. In November 1983, ranked as maegashira 3, he won his first special prize and three gold stars by defeating all three yokozuna (Kitanoumi, Chiyonofuji and Takanosato). This earned him promotion to sekiwake. The next March, he defeated three yokozuna and three ≈çzeki and won special prizes for Fighting Spirit and Outstanding Performance. He was runner-up in the July 1985 tournament, recording 12 wins against 3 losses, enough to secure promotion to ≈çzeki. He was runner-up again in his ≈çzeki debut, scoring 12‚Äì3 once more. His performance over the next few tournaments was good but not spectacular, until in May 1987 he won his first tournament title with a perfect record of 15 wins and no losses, becoming the first man other than Chiyonofuji to win a top division y≈´sh≈ç in the new Ry≈çgoku Kokugikan. After two runner-up performances in the next two tournaments, in September of that year he was promoted to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank. His three tournament record of 40 wins and just five losses tied with Wakanohana II as the best produced by a candidate for yokozuna promotion in the six tournaments per year era (post 1958). Yokozuna His first tournament as yokozuna finished with a disappointing 8‚Äì7 score, but in March 1988 he beat yokozuna Hokutoumi in a play-off to achieve his second tournament victory. However, the Kokonoe stable yokozuna Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi were to prove dominant over the next few tournaments and he never won another tournament. He scored a famous victory over Chiyonofuji on the last day of the November 1988 tournament, however, ending Chiyonofuji's 53-bout winning streak in what turned out to be the last sumo match of the Sh≈çwa period. From 1989 he began to suffer from sleep apnea. He gained weight, passing 200 kg, and began to suffer leg problems. He lost some weight through a combination of training and diet, but this weakened him and he never fully recovered. He missed most of the July tournament due to a knee injury, then in September he became the first yokozuna ever to go make-koshi, or turn in a losing score of just 7 wins out of 15 bouts. He did the only thing expected of him ‚Äì he offered to resign ‚Äì but he was told by the Japan Sumo Association to soldier on. In his comeback tournament in January 1990 he scraped by with 8 wins but suffered a serious ankle injury and missed the next four tournaments, an unprecedented absence for a yokozuna. He finally returned to the ring in November 1990, and scored ten wins, defeating Chiyonofuji again on the final day. In March 1991 he was runner-up for the seventh and final time in his career, finishing one win behind Hokutoumi on 12‚Äì3. His final day defeat to Kirishima handed the y≈´sh≈ç to Hokutoumi and robbed him of the chance of a play-off (which Hokutoumi admitted he would almost certainly have lost as he was injured in his bout the previous day). ≈ånokuni missed the following tournament in May due to a fever resulting from a skin infection, and upon his return in July he was defeated four times in the first eight days. He announced his retirement from sumo at the age of just 28 after being beaten by Akinoshima on Day 8, leaving a disappointing record of just one y≈´sh≈ç and two runner-up performances in his 23 tournaments at yokozuna rank. He never managed to obtain the highest rank on the banzuke of Yokozuna East in any of those tournaments. Discounting the special circumstances of Futahaguro's departure from sumo he was the second youngest yokozuna to retire, after Tochinoumi. Retirement from the ring ≈ånokuni has remained in the sumo world as an oyakata, or elder, and opened his own training stable, Shibatayama-beya in 1999. In March 2008 the stable produced its first sekitori, Daiy≈´bu, but he spent only one tournament in j≈´ry≈ç and retired suddenly in June 2010 after falling out with his stablemaster. Daiy≈´bu filed a lawsuit in September claiming that he was slapped and punched, and his topknot was cut off against his will. Shibatayama was questioned by police over the alleged incidents. The case was eventually settled out of court. In March 2016 Shibatayama and one of his wrestlers, Komanokuni, were ordered by the Tokyo District Court to pay 32.4 million yen (287,500 USD) in compensation to another former wrestler who the court ruled had faced \\"daily abuse\\" since joining in 2008 and had to undergo four surgeries for a detached retina, eventually losing sight in the eye in 2013. Shibatayama appealed the ruling, and in November 2016 a court-mediated, confidential settlement was reached. In 2013 his old stable closed when Hanaregoma-oyakata reached the mandatory retirement age, and their wrestlers transferred to Shibatayama stable. As of January 2020 the stable has one sekitori, Sakigake. He was elected to the board of directors of the Sumo Association in 2018 and has the role of head of the public relations department. Personal life He has been married since 1989. He has a reputation as a baker of cakes, and often appears on baking shows on television. He published a book (Á¨¨62‰ª£Ê®™Á∂±Â§ß‰πÉÂõΩ„ÅÆÂÖ®ÂõΩ„Çπ„Ç§„Éº„ÉÑÂ∑°Ê•≠, 62nd Yokozuna ≈ånokuni's National Sweets Tour). He baked a cake to celebrate Daiy≈´bu's promotion to j≈´ry≈ç. His autobiography, titled Winning Even When You Lose, was published in 2008. Fighting style ≈ånokuni favoured grip on his opponent's mawashi was migi-yotsu, a left hand outside and right hand inside position. His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri, which accounted for nearly half his victories at sekitori level. He was also fond of uwatenage, or overarm throw. He had a somewhat defensive style, preferring to wait for his opportunity rather than take the initiative right from the beginning of a bout.

Background Born in Dingwall, he was educated at Glenalmond College in Perthshire and it was playing for them he was first scouted. Career He debuted for Scotland in the second-half defeat against Wales at the age of 22 in August 2003 (23‚Äì9). Hall had already represented Scotland at national under-19 and under-21 levels, before starting a training contract with the Glasgow Caledonians (now Glasgow Warriors) before turning professional in 2002. He began his career with Glasgow in the 1999‚Äì00 season, making three substitute appearances in the Welsh-Scottish League and 1 appearance in Scottish Inter-District Championship. He made the bench the following season but did not play. He spent much of the 2001‚Äì02 season recovering from a broken leg but played for Glasgow in 5 matches that season. He then transferred to Edinburgh Rugby where he spent five years learning his craft and cementing his place as Scotland's first-choice hooker. He was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup but picked up a knee injury and was forced to withdraw. For the start of the 2007‚Äì08 season Hall went back down the M8 to rejoin the Glasgow Warriors. In March 2012 he signed his second contract extension, which runs until 2014. On 24 March 2015, it was announced Hall would retire at the end of the season and move into a career in financial services.

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 264 - 265. The Clan MacCallum may have originally been a separate clan until the 18th century, when the chief of the Clan MacCallum adopted the name Malcolm after inheriting the Malcolm estate, and the two clans were drawn together under the same chief. History Origins of the Clan The name MacCallum is derived from Mac Ghille Chaluim which means son of the disciple of Columba. The MacCallums settled in Lorne towards the end of the 13th century. Maol or shavenhead is Scottish Gaelic for monk. Therefore, Maol Chaluim can be translated as monk or disciple of Columba. Historian Ian Grimble has challenged the idea that MacCallum and Malcolm are simply interchangeable versions of the same name. Grimble claims that Colm was common throughout all areas of Celtic settlement. The name Malcolm appears as a surname as early as the 14th century in Dumbartonshire and Stirlingshire. Malcolm was also the name of four Scottish kings. 15th, 16th and 17th century  Duntrune Castle, seat of the clan chief, from the east In 1414 Ronald MacCaullum of Corbarron was appointed as constable of Craignish Castle. In May 1562 Donald McGillespie Vich O'Challum received a charter of the lands of Poltalloch in the parish of Kilmartin in the county of Argyll from Duncan Campbell of Duntrune. The Reverend Archibald MacCallum translated parts of the Bible into Gaelic. In 1642 he succeeded his cousin to become the fourth Laird of Poltalloch. His son was Zachary MacCallum who was educated at the University of St Andrews and was also a noted swordsman. Zachary's younger brother was Duncan whose son, Neil MacCallum served in the French Navy and is said to have been the natural father of Louis-Joseph de Montcalm. Zachary was a supporter of the Marquess of Argyll and he was killed in 1647 by forces of Sir Alexander MacDonald at Ederline. After killing seven of the enemy Zachary MacCallum turned to Sir Alexander MacDonald, who would have been his eighth that day if MacCallum was not taken from behind by an enemy (Maclean), who killed him with a Scythe. John Malcolm of Balbedie was chamberlain of Fife during the reign of Charles I. He had four sons: Sir John Malcolm who was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia (see: Malcolm baronets), Alexander Malcolm, Lord Lochore who became a judge, James Malcolm who fought for John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee at the Battle of Killiecrankie and Michael Malcolm. 18th and 19th centuries In the late 18th century chief Dugald MacCallum, the ninth of Poltalloch changed his surname to Malcolm. This may have been because he inherited the Malcolm estates in 1779. Of the Malcolm chieftainship line: Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm was Commander in Chief of Saint Helena, and won the regard of Napoleon. Sir Pulteney Malcolm also commanded HMS Royal Oak. According to research by the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership, during the 18th and 19th centuries, the Malcolm family greatly increased their wealth due to their activities in slave trading and their ownership of plantations in Jamaica, redeploying their slave-derived wealth in agrarian improvement and infrastructure in Britain. The records show that Neill Malcolm the 12th, owned more than 2000 enslaved people on 11 separate plantations The 12th Laird opposed Abolition and claimed thousands (millions of pounds in 'today' money, in compensation for the loss of his slaves in 1834 from the Slave Compensation Commission. The Malcolm family have a recent entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography that details the role of Neill Malcolm, 12th of Poltalloch in accelerating his father's move from slave trading to investment in Britain and portrays him as a 'paternalistic' landlord in Scotland. The same entry details the role of his son, Neill Malcolm or 13th of Poltalloch in driving clearances and evictions from his estates in Scotland. John Wingfield Malcolm of Poltalloch was created Lord Malcolm in 1896, and died in 1902, when the peerage became extinct, though his brother inherited his estate, and the feudal title of 'Malcolm of Poltalloch', descended with the chieftainship of the Clan. The Chief Malcolm family had an impressive reputation for military and naval success throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In addition to this, more than one of the chiefs of the clan has entered into the world of politics, the last of these being Sir Ian Malcolm, who was a Member of Parliament until 1919. More recent examples include Australian-born political journalist Mungo Wentworth MacCallum (b. 1941) and Stephen McCallum, Adelaide-born labour organiser and prominent operating figure within the Socialist Left faction of the Australian Labor Party in South Australia and Tasmania. The beginning of the modern West Highland White Terrier breed is attributed to Colonel Malcolm of Poltalloch, Scotland in Argyllshire in the late 1800s. The story has it that Colonel Edward Malcolm was hunting with his pack of cairn terriers when he thought he saw a rabbit running through the underbrush and shot it, only to find that he had shot his favorite Cairn. From that day forward, he determined only to breed white dogs, because they were easy to see. At the same time, the Campbell of Rosneath began to breed white dogs which he called ‚ÄúRoseneath‚Äù terriers after the name of his estate. Later, the ‚ÄúPoltalloch‚Äù and ‚ÄúRoseneath‚Äù terriers were combined into the West Highland White Terrier, a name coined by Colonel Malcolm of Poltalloch Estates, which remains a very popular breed today. Clan Chief The current Chief of Clan Malcolm is Robin Neill Lochnell Malcolm, 19th Laird of Poltalloch.

Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Shepton Mallet Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Huxham Green The hamlet of Huxham Green is just off the A37, south of Shepton Mallet. It is notable for the large area of common land at its centre (comprising two adjoining registered commons). This is one of the few areas of common land in this part of Somerset and is thought to have once been a holding area for cattle herds being driven to the markets at Lydford-on-Fosse and Glastonbury. There is a public right of Freedom to roam over the common land by virtue of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, and several public footpaths extend across the surrounding countryside. Huckeymead Lane, which crosses the common, ends at a bridleway that leads to the Monarch's Way. Local wildlife include roe deer, barn owls and (in the large pond on the common) greater- crested newts. Midsummer view over the common land at Huxham Green Huxham Green includes four farms which date back to the Middle Ages and were once owned by Glastonbury Abbey.

The contemporary diocese is co-extensive with the department of Dr√¥me. The Cathedral of Valence was originally dedicated to Saints Cornelius and Cyprianus (Bishops of Rome and of Carthage, both mid-third century martyrsSaint Jerome wrote that they had been martyred on the same day, September 14.), but in 1095, during his visit to France to rouse up the aristocracy for a Crusade to liberate the Holy Land, Pope Urban II rededicated the cathedral to Saint Apollinaris, one of Valence's sixth century bishops. The Cathedral had fourteen Canons, including a Dean, a Provost, the Archdeacon, a Theologian, and the Abbot of S. Felix.Gallia christiana XVI, p. 291. In the Great Western Schism (1378‚Äì1417), the Bishops of Valence-et-Die were all appointed by and were loyal to the Popes of the Avignon Obedience. Pope Pius VI, who had been taken prisoner and deported from Italy by troops of the French Directory, was imprisoned in the fortress of Valence. After six weeks he died there, on 29 August 1799. His body was buried in the chapel, and a month later, on First Consul Napoleon's orders, given a public funeral and buried in the town cemetery.

He was the last male member of the Silesian Piast dynasty descending from W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile (1105‚Äì1159). Family George William was the eldest but only surviving son of Duke Christian of Legnica-Brzeg (1618-1672) by his wife Louise (1631-1680), a daughter of the Ascanian prince John Casimir of Anhalt-Dessau. He had three siblings: * Karolina of Legnica- Brieg (1652-1707), last Silesian Piast duchess, married to Frederick, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Wiesenburg (1651‚Äì1724) in 1672; * Louise (1657‚Äì1660); * Christian Louis (1664-1664). As the only surviving son, George William was the sole heir to his father's possessions. Duke Christian of Legnica-Brzeg had spent many years in exile in Poland and in the Duchy of Prussia during the Thirty Years' War, after George William's grandfather Duke John Christian of Brieg had fallen out of favour with the Habsburg emperor Ferdinand II. Duke Christian became sole ruler over the Silesian duchies of Legnica and Brzeg in 1664. After the abdication of King John II Casimir Vasa of Poland in 1668, he even put forward his candidacy for the Polish throne; to win the affection and support of the old nobility, he initially wanted to give his newborn son an old Piast name (like Mieszko or Boles≈Çaw); however, the Calvinist clergy of his duchy opposed this, maintaining that the idea could bring the return to paganism over Poland. The duke, however, saw to it that his son spoke Polish and wore Polish clothes. Life The deaths in 1663 and 1664 of his paternal uncles Duke George III of Brzeg and Duke Louis IV of Legnica without surviving issue left him as the only heir of his father in the still vast Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg. As a result, since his early years, George William received a careful education. During his upbringing, he was put in the hands of the Anhalt-Bernburg count-marshal August Friedrich Bohne, and the personal doctor Henry Martini. During this first period of his education, he acquired an excellent knowledge of German, French and Latin, also understood Italian, Spanish and Polish; he was also educated in theology, philosophy, and rhetoric. After his father's death in 1672, the then twelve-year-old George William succeeded him as Duke of Legnica and Brzeg; during his minority, the regency was exercised by his mother, Dowager Duchess Louise who held the towns of Wo≈Ç√≥w and O≈Çawa as her dower (wittum). Fearing claims raised by the Habsburg Emperor Leopold I in his capacity as ruler over the Crown of Bohemia, Duke Christian had devised by will that his son was formally under the tutelage of his maternal uncle Prince John George II of Anhalt-Dessau and the mighty Hohenzollern elector Frederick William of Brandenburg. The day before his father's death, Louise sent her son to study at the Viadrina University in Brandenburgian Frankfurt/Oder, considered as an act of mistrust by the Imperial court. On the other hand, the regency of the dowager duchess faced the opposition of the Protestant estates of Legnica-Brzeg, thanks to her increasingly open support for the Catholic faith; a major scandal occurred when the young duke's sister Karolina secretly married Frederick, a member of the aristocrat Catholic family of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Wiesenburg. The Brandenburg elector reached an understanding with the Habsburg emperor, and in 1673 George William returned to Brzeg, where he received the homage by the estates. On 14 March 1675, the young duke could take formal possession of the government of his lands after he went to the Imperial court in Vienna, making his solemn homage to Emperor Leopold I, who confirmed his coming of age and the succession to his father's lands. Immediately after the beginning of George William's rule, Duchess Louise was forced to give up her area of Wo≈Ç√≥w. The announcements of the start of a good and prosperous government by George William were stopped with the sudden death of the duke on 21 November 1675. The cause of his death was an intense fever, developed shortly after his return from a hunt, the first sign of smallpox. The duke was buried in the church of St. John in Legnica, alongside his father, where his grieved mother had a mausoleum built. Legacy Funerary medal, 1675 Upon his death, the Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg reverted to Emperor Leopold as ruler over the Bohemian crown lands, which since 1526 were integral part of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy. Leopold took up the government by a Landeshauptmann deputy, despite the claims of George William's morganatic uncle Count August of Legnica, and had several Counter-Reformation measures implemented. Duchess Louise retained her lands of O≈Çawa until her death in 1680, when they were also incorporated into the Bohemian lands. The independent Masovian Piasts had died out in 1526, while the Teschen (Cieszyn) line had become extinct in 1653. George William was therefore the last ruling member of all the Piast dynasty, which finally became extinct with the death of his only surviving sibling, Karolina, in 1707. The term \\"Piast dynasty\\" was first used by the Polish historian Adam Naruszewicz in his books History of Poland, which he started in 1779. On George William's burial crypt a text was carved referring to him as the last of the Piast dukes of Silesia, who are since the 17th century Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN Warsaw 1975 vol. III page 505: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Piast Dynasty referred to as \\"Silesian Piasts\\".

It is about 1 mile west of the A19 and 8 miles north-east of Northallerton. It is on the River Wiske and West Rounton is nearby. The population taken at the 2011 Census was less than 100. Details are included in the civil parish of West Rounton. East Rounton was the site of Rounton Grange, a country house designed by the architect Philip Webb in 1872 to 1876 for the industrialist Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell. It was demolished in 1953.  Early history  The area was named ‚ÄúRantune‚Äù in the Domesday survey of 1086, valued at ¬£2, and with The Lord being the King, William the Conqueror. The Church of St Lawrence is thought to probably date back to the 13th century, but at least to 1483. It was restored by Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell in 1884. In a field to the north of the church are the remains of the medieval village. The village appears on maps of 1577 and 1611, but is absent from later maps of 1645 and 1720. There is an 18th century bridge over the River Wiske, where an old inn used to stand; the Black Horse.  Recent history  In 1866, Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, a scientist and ironmaster (Dorman Long ‚Äì Middlesbrough) and early patron of the Arts and Crafts movement, bought the estate. Architect Philip Webb was commissioned by Lowthian Bell to design Rounton Grange to replace an existing farmhouse. Building commenced in 1872 and completed in 1876, creating a ‚Äúlandmark of nineteenth century domestic architecture‚Äù in the view of Country Life magazine. William Morris and Sir Edward Burne-Jones were engaged as interior designers. Additional buildings were added by Lowthian Bell‚Äôs son, Sir Hugh Bell, using George Jack as architect, including the East Lodge in 1909 linked by outside electric lights to the Grange. The Rounton Village Hall, built in 1907 by Tarrans of Hutton Rudby, funded by Sir Hugh & Lady Bell, now includes a War Memorial at the front. The hall is adjoined on either side by three cottages (The Square). It was used during the First World War as a hospital for wounded soldiers, and is still in use today by local residents. With two sets of Death Duties suffered in the early 1900s, the Grange became too expensive to maintain. It was offered to the National Trust, but was declined due to lack of an endowment. The Bell family moved to Mount Grace Priory in 1926 and the contents of the Grange were sold in 1932. The house was demolished in 1953 and the gardens abandoned. Although the Grange no longer exists, various estate buildings still do, built in the Arts & Crafts style and mostly designed by Philip Webb. These include the Old Lodge, Home Farm, Garden House and walled gardens, the Coach House (used to hold the coaches and a horse-drawn steam-driven fire engine), the Motor House, Keeper‚Äôs Cottage (home of the gamekeeper to the Grange) and Rounton House, the latter designed by George Jack (Philip Webb‚Äôs assistant) in 1905 for the use of the estate manager. Pear Tree Cottage was originally the Rest House for sick or injured estate workers. The Old School House was the village school, opened in 1877 but closed in 1967. Opposite the Village Hall, The School House was the residence of the headmistress. The Old Post Office was the village shop and post office / telegram office, closing in 1979. A stained-glass window memorial to a local resident, Gertrude Bell, grand-daughter of Lowthian Bell, historian and extensive traveller, is included in The Church of St. Lawrence. It was made by Douglas Strachan and depicts Magdalen College, Oxford and Khadimain, Baghdad. Miss Bell was the subject of a film in 2015, ‚ÄúQueen of the Desert‚Äù, and of a documentary, ‚ÄúLetters from Baghdad‚Äù, the following year.

He was educated at Ludgrove School (1979‚Äì1984), Eton College (1985‚Äì1989) and the University of Edinburgh (1990‚Äì1994), where he graduated with 1st Class Honours in English Literature. In 1995 Cumming was approached for recruitment by the United Kingdom's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) but did not go on to work for them. Career Cumming's first novel, A Spy by Nature was published in the UK in June 2001. The novel's hero, Alec Milius, is a flawed loner in his early 20s who is instructed by MI5 to sell doctored research data on oil exploration in the Caspian Sea to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). In August 2001, Cumming moved to Madrid. His second novel, The Hidden Man (2003), tells the story of two brothers investigating the murder of their father, a former SIS officer, at the hands of the Russian mafia. The Hidden Man also examines the clandestine role played by SIS and the CIA during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. His third novel, The Spanish Game (2006), marks the return of anti-hero Alec Milius, who becomes involved in a plot by the paramilitary Basque nationalist organization ETA to bring down the Spanish government. The Spanish Game was described by The Times as one of the six finest spy novels of all time, alongside Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Funeral in Berlin and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Typhoon, published in the UK in 2008, is a political thriller about a CIA plot to destabilise China on the eve of the Beijing Olympics.

The architecture is predominantly neoclassical in style with an Italian influence. Many individual buildings are listed, and Little Germany is also protected as a Conservation Area.  History and information  The buildings within Little Germany date back to the 19th century, developing from 1855. Most of the buildings were constructed for the use of textile businesses, although are also a few non-commercial buildings, for example Baptist and Methodist chapels. The commercial buildings are the legacy of merchants from mainland Europe, many of them Jewish, who spent large sums of money constructing imposing warehouses for the storage and sale of their goods for export. A large proportion of the merchants came from Germany hence the name Little Germany. Bradford became more attractive as a centre of international trade in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War, which disrupted commercial relations between France and Germany. Architectural practices included Milnes & France, Lockwood & Mawson, Andrews & Delaunay and J.T. Fairbank building in italianate style. An 1871 building by George Corson for Scottish clients is in Scottish baronial style. Caspian House (61 East Parade) was built in 1873, as the warehouse of D. Delius and Company; the senior partner in the business was the father of the composer Frederick Delius. Little Germany is also the home of the Bradford Playhouse, which has a mural on the back of the building that commemorates the centenary of the founding of the Independent Labour Party in Bradford in 1893.  Renovation  Little Germany is still one of Bradford's busiest commercial areas, with over 110 businesses and organisations with 3,000 workers. It attracts around 100,000 visitors each year. The local authority is currently promoting plans to regenerate the area by renovating and converting the interior of the old buildings into housing, hotels, offices, whilst preserving the originally Victorian distinctive architecture.  Redevelopment projects   Eastbrook Hall redevelopment  Eastbrook Hall Ham Construction undertook the redevelopment of Eastbrook Hall in Little Germany. The project cost an estimated ¬£11 million and converted the building into 63 high-quality apartments as well some commercial usage on Leeds Road. The project included a refurbishment of the exterior and roof of the listed building which had suffered extensive fire damage. The hall was built in 1903 and was originally used as a Methodist mission. The redevelopment was being funded through a public private sector funding agreement, as well as the Prince's Regeneration Trust. Work was finally completed in 2008, some months after the original projected finish date was set.  The Gatehaus  The Gatehaus is an 11-storey glass building constructed within the Little Germany district. Construction began in 2005 and was completed in 2007 with a total cost of ¬£22 million. The project was originally proposed as a 17-storey landmark but was changed due to a rethink after suggestions that its height was incompatible with the surrounding Victorian buildings. The scheme was developed by Asquith Properties.  Freemans  In April 2012 retail giant Freeman Grattan Holdings, now a German-owned company, secured a deal to open a new head office and house around 300 staff in a Grade-II-listed former wool warehouse in Little Germany.

It operates Monday & Wednesday drop-in that provides advice around accessing benefits, support showers and laundry facilities. There is also a Supported Employment Programme which provides opportunity for people who have experienced homelessness and crisis to get back into work. Plus a Winter Night Shelter and support services such as access to therapy. Church in the Chapel Union Chapel is a Congregational church, which describes itself as \\"An open community exploring and revitalising the faith in challenging times\\" and meets every Sunday for worship. The church meets every Sunday at 11am and is committed building community and encouraging social justice. It also runs Culture Cafe 11am - 2pm each Wednesday to help tackle social isolation and provide a space for conversation and creativity. History The congregation first met in 1799 in a house in Highbury Grove as a union of evangelical Anglicans and non- conformists, and moved to a previous building on the present site in Compton Terrace, just off Upper Street, in 1806. The current building is in the Victorian gothic style of architecture. It was designed by James Cubitt of Loughton, and built between 1874 and 1877, with further additions from 1877 to 1890, while Henry Allon was pastor. The chapel was used for a major scene in the 1982 film, Who Dares Wins. Since 1982 and facing demolition the charity Friends of Union Chapel has helped conserve the buildings. The charity Union Chapel Project established in 1991 organise activities including gigs and events to help raise money for the building and open it up. Behind the church is the large Sunday School, built on the Akron Plan.

It is undoubtedly one of the finest in the world. Neither James Cubitt, the architect of the Chapel, nor Rev Henry Allon, the minister at the time, wanted the congregation to be distracted by the sight of an organ or organist: they wanted the music itself to be the focus during worship. So the organ is deliberately hidden away behind ornate screens under the rose window, which itself actually hints at the organ's importance, with its depiction of eight angels all playing different musical instruments. It is one of just two organs left in the United Kingdom, and the only one in England, with a fully working original hydraulic (water powered) blowing system, which can be used as an alternative to the electric blowers. The organ was restored in 1946 by Monk & Gunther; and by Harrison & Harrison in 2013.

In that year, the Diocese of Ferentino was united into the Diocese of Veroli-Frosinone; which was the name of the historic Diocese of Veroli from 1956. It is immediately subject to the Holy See. History Veroli was only fifty-two miles from Rome, and therefore an excellent benefice for a prelate who was employed in the Roman Curia.Ughelli, p. 1386. In a bull of 18 June 1081 Pope Gregory VII confirmed the extent of the territory of the diocese of Veroli for Bishop Albert.Kehr, II, p. 156, no. 1. Pope Urban II confirmed the possessions of the Church of Veroli in a bull of 2 July 1097,Kehr, II, p. 156, no. 2. and the provisions of the bull were repeated by Pope Paschal II in a bull of 4 September 1108, written for the benefit of Bishop Albert.Kehr, II, p. 156, no. 4. Pope Alexander III, in exile from Rome, lived with his Court at Veroli from 16 March 1170 to 10 September 1170. At some point during his reign, Pope Alexander determined that the number of Canons in the Cathedral of Saint Andrew in Veroli should be sixteen.Kehr, II, p. 161, no. 1. Pope Lucius III left Anagni and sought refuge in Veroli, from 27 March 1184 to 28 May 1184.Jaffe II, pp. 463-465. On 8 September 1351, Veroli was shaken by a major earthquake, while the clergy were singing Vespers in the cathedral. The co-cathedral of S. Salome was completely ruined, and the saint's remains were buried in the rubble for more than six weeks. The entire city of Veroli was heavily damaged.Ughelli I, p. 1396. Cappelletti VI, p. 498. The first steps toward the foundation of an episcopal seminary in the diocese of Veroli were taken by Bishop Girolamo Asteo (1608‚Äì1626), forty-eight years after the Council of Trent had decreed that every diocese ought to have a seminary for the education of the clergy. The first students did not enter the institution until 1652.Caperna, Storia di Veroli, p. 439. On 15 May 1863, Pope Pius IX paid a formal visit to Veroli, \\"to raise the morale of the inhabitants of the area.\\"Caperna, Storia di Veroli, pp. 510-514. In 1818, when the diocese of Fondi was suppressed and its territory handed over to the diocese of Gaeta, immediate protest were lodged by the town of Vallecorsa, who wished to belong to the Papal States and the civil province of Rome, a protest which was entered again and again over the following century. Finally, on 21 March 1921, Pope Benedict XV issued the bull \\"Sedis Apostolicae\\", removing Vallecorsa from the archdiocese of Gaeta and annexing it to the diocese of Veroli.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 13 (Rome 1921), pp. 255-256. Diocesan synods Bishop Ortensio Battisti (1567‚Äì1594) presided over two diocesan synods between 1568 and 1593. Bishop Eugenio Fucci (1594‚Äì1608) held a diocesan synod. A diocesan synod was held by Bishop Eugenio Fucchi between 1596 and 1608.J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus XXXVIbis (Paris: H. Welter 1913), p. 1013, 1021, 1023. A diocesan synod was held by Bishop Fortunato Maurizi (1856‚Äì1868) on 28‚Äì30 June 1863.Prima dioecesana synodus verulana ab illustrissimo et reverendissimo D. D.

Name change By 1956, the Vatican had become aware of changing settlement and employment patterns in cities and towns throughout Italy. In central Lazio, Frosinone had long since become the largest city, as well as the regional capital and seat of magistrates and public services (from the early 19th century). Pope Pius XII, therefore, authorized the Consistorial Congregation in the papal government to issue a decree, adding the name of Frosinone to that of the diocese of Veroli. The decree of 29 February 1956 ordered that the title of the diocese and the title of the bishop should be Verulanus-Frusinatensis.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 48 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1956), pp. 218‚Äì219. Diocesan reorganization The Second Vatican Council, in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses, in particular those with financial and personnel problems.In its decree Christus Dominus, section 22, it stated: \\"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\\" It also decreed that the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat. Based on the revisions, a set of Normae was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. This applied to the dioceses of Veroli and Frosinone. The Vatican therefore continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of dioceses. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Veroli, Frosinone, and Ferentino be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Frusinatensis-Verulana- Ferentina. The seat of the diocese was to be in Frosinone, whose cathedral was to serve as the cathedral of the merged dioceses. The cathedrals in Veroli and Ferentino were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Frosinone, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Veroli, Frosinone, and Ferentino.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Citt√† del Vaticano 1987), pp. 825-828.

Description The Sparl√∂sa Runestone was discovered in 1669 in the southern wall of the church at Sparl√∂sa, now part of Vara Municipality.Run - och bildstenen i Sparl√∂sa, Foteviken Museum Before their historical value was understood, many runestones were used as construction material for roads, walls, and bridges. Following a fire at the church in 1684, the runestone was split in rebuilding the wall. It was removed from the wall in 1937 and the two sections reunited. The stone is 1.77 metres tall and it is dated to about 800 AD based upon its transitional use of rune forms from both the elder and younger futhark, but it has a probably younger line added to it saying Gisli made this memorial after Gunnar, his brother. The dating is based on the style of the images, such as a ship, which suggest the 8th century, like similar images from Gotland. However, a sail on the ship suggests a later dating than the 8th century. The runestone is famous for its depictions and its tantalizing and mysterious references to a great battle, the names Eric and Alrik, the father who resided in Uppsala and the text descending from the gods. The stone provides an early attestation of the place name Uppsala, and the two personal names Eric (\\"complete ruler\\") and Alrik (\\"everyone's ruler\\") are both royal names, known to have been worn by the semi-legendary Swedish Yngling dynasty at Uppsala. Moreover, the mention of a great battle is suggestive of the equally semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars that are mentioned in Beowulf. The words runa Ä r√¶ginkundu meaning \\"runes of divine origin\\" are also in the runic text on the Noleby Runestone and would appear in stanza 79 of the H√°vam√°l of the Poetic Edda several centuries later. The runestone has imagery on four of its sides that apparently is unrelated to the runic text and in one interpretation predates it. One side has a building at the top that is over a crescent ship with a sail marked with a cross and with two birds, possibly peacocks, on its yardarms. At the bottom is a man on horseback hunting a stag and using a hunting leopard, which is not native to Sweden. The next side has an owl, with a head reminding of a lion's, and a goose fighting a snake. One side has a man and a cross band. One suggested interpretation is that the images on the stone are a memorial to Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths from 471 to 526 AD, with the building depicted on the stone a representation of his mausoleum.

Fidenza 1922 as a midfielder. Biography Parma Born in Parma, Emilia‚ÄìRomagna, Savi started his career at hometown club Parma. Savi made his Serie A debut on 23 April 2005, losing to A.C. Milan 0‚Äì3. He was the starting midfielder and replaced by Renato Olive after receiving a caution. He also played the next match, winning Livorno 6‚Äì4. He came off the bench in the first half to replace Jorge Bola√±o in that match. That season Parma almost relegated. Savi also played for Parma at 2004‚Äì05 UEFA Cup, which he made his professional and European debut on 14 April, a 0‚Äì0 draw with Austria Wien. He also played the next two matches, the semi-finals. The team finished as losing semi-finalists to CSKA Moskva. In 2005‚Äì06 Serie A, Savi made 8 appearances. Due to 2006 Italian football scandal, Parma qualified to UEFA Cup again. The club chose a squad rotation tactics, which Savi played all 6 European matches in the first half of the season, including 4 starts in group stage. However, he did not play any game in 2006‚Äì07 Serie A, only 4 matches in the cup. In January 2007 he left for Monza. Loans Savi joined Monza in January 2007. He only played 9 games in Italian third division. In July, he joined fellow Serie C1 club Arezzo (but in another group). He made a double figure appearances before returned to Parma. In July 2008 he moved back to Lega Pro Prima Divisione (ex- Serie C1) for SPAL, at first on loan. On 2 February 2009 the deal became a co-ownership deal. However, in June Parma bought back Savi. He then injured and left for Lega Pro Seconda Divisione club Carpenedolo in August 2009. Savi did not play any league match that season. After 6 months inactive in football, Savi left for another L.P. second division club Crociati Noceto, located 12 km away from the city of Parma. He only played once. FC Brussels Savi moved abroad in 2011‚Äì12 season. In August 2011 it was reported that Savi was finalizing a deal to Maltese club Valletta. However, on 8 September he was signed by Belgian Second Division club FC Brussels, rejoining Parma team-mate Sulaiman Sesay Fullah and numbers of Italian trained players. Savi made his debut on 13 November 2011. After the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, Savi intended to retire due to a cruciate ligament tear in the knee but eventually decided to continue challenging the world of professional football. In August 2012, he joined Serie D side A.C. Fidenza 1922. International career Savi had played for Azzurrini from under-16 to under-20 level. He was the member of U-17 team at 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship qualification, wore no.10 shirt. In the elite round he changed to wear no.13. He played all 6 competitive matches in that tournament as starter The team finished as the runner-up in the elite round group 3, failing to advance. In the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification, he wore no.8 shirt and also played all 3 matches as starter. Azzurrini finished as the third in group 6. Since then Savi followed the team- mate promoted to Italy U-20, a bridging team between U-19 and U-21 in November 2005. However Savi failed to earn any cap since November 2006. His last call- up, however in January 2008. Savi played 3 times in total in Four Nations Tournament, in 2005‚Äì06 and 2006‚Äì07 edition.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 Among its patron saints the city venerates St. Lontius, bishop and martyr, and St. Theodore and St. Apollonius, bishops and confessors in the fourth century. The Christian cemetery discovered near the Church of Sts. Felix and Fortunatus, dates from the earlier half of the fourth century, and these two saints were probably martyred under Diocletian. History The first bishop of whom there is any certain record is Horontius (590), a partisan of the Schism of the Three Chapters. Other bishops were: Vitalis (901), high chancellor of King Berengar of Ivrea; Girolamo (1000), deposed by Emperor Henry II for political sedition; Torengo, in whose episcopate a number of bishops rebelled against the episcopal authority. Uberto was deposed by Pope Innocent III as a despoiler of church property, but the canons put off until 1219 the election of his successor, Gilberto, who was forced by the tyranny of Ezzelino to live in exile. Under Bishop Emiliani (1409) took place the alleged apparition of the Blessed Virgin on Monte Berico which led to the foundation of the famous sanctuary. Pietro Barbo (1451) was afterwards elected Pope Paul II. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Zeno (1468) was distinguished for his sanctity and learning. Matteo Priuli (1563) founded the seminary and made efforts for reform. Alvise M. Ganrielli (1779) restored many churches and the seminary. The See of Vicenza was suffragan of Aquileia, then of Udine, and since 1818 of Venice. The diocese had circa 1900: 219 parishes, with 477,000 souls; 699 secular and 39 regular priests; 10 houses of male religious and 52 sisters; 4 schools for boys, and 52 for girls. The Catholic Press comprised \\"Il Berico\\" (tri- weekly, Vicenza), \\"La Riscossa\\" (tri-weekly, Breganze), and six other periodicals. Bishops  *Pietro Filargis, O.F.M.

An alternative statement of the theorem is that any normal Hall subgroup N of a finite group G has a complement in G. Moreover if either N or G/N is solvable then the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem also states that all complements of N in G are conjugate. The assumption that either N or G/N is solvable can be dropped as it is always satisfied, but all known proofs of this require the use of the much harder Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem. The Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem at least partially answers the question: \\"In a composition series, how can we classify groups with a certain set of composition factors?\\" The other part, which is where the composition factors do not have coprime orders, is tackled in extension theory. History The Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem was introduced by . Theorem 25, which he credits to Issai Schur, proves the existence of a complement, and theorem 27 proves that all complements are conjugate under the assumption that N or G/N is solvable. It is not easy to find an explicit statement of the existence of a complement in Schur's published works, though the results of on the Schur multiplier imply the existence of a complement in the special case when the normal subgroup is in the center. Zassenhaus pointed out that the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem for non-solvable groups would follow if all groups of odd order are solvable, which was later proved by Feit and Thompson. Ernst Witt showed that it would also follow from the Schreier conjecture (see for Witt's unpublished 1937 note about this), but the Schreier conjecture has only been proved using the classification of finite simple groups, which is far harder than the Feit‚ÄìThompson theorem. Examples If we do not impose the coprime condition, the theorem is not true: consider for example the cyclic group C_4 and its normal subgroup C_2. Then if C_4 were a semidirect product of C_2 and C_4 / C_2 \\\\cong C_2 then C_4 would have to contain two elements of order 2, but it only contains one. Another way to explain this impossibility of splitting C_4 (i.e. expressing it as a semidirect product) is to observe that the automorphisms of C_2 are the trivial group, so the only possible [semi]direct product of C_2 with itself is a direct product (which gives rise to the Klein four-group, a group that is non-isomorphic with C_4). An example where the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem does apply is the symmetric group on 3 symbols, S_3, which has a normal subgroup of order 3 (isomorphic with C_3) which in turn has index 2 in S_3 (in agreement with the theorem of Lagrange), so S_3 / C_3 \\\\cong C_2. Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime, the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem applies and S_3 \\\\cong C_3 \\\\rtimes C_2. Note that the automorphism group of C_3 is C_2 and the automorphism of C_3 used in the semidirect product that gives rise to S_3 is the non-trivial automorphism that permutes the two non-identity elements of C_3. Furthermore, the three subgroups of order 2 in S_3 (any of which can serve as a complement to C_3 in S_3) are conjugate to each other. The non-triviality of the (additional) conjugacy conclusion can be illustrated with the Klein four-group V as the non-example. Any of the three proper subgroups of V (all of which have order 2) is normal in V; fixing one of these subgroups, any of the other two remaining (proper) subgroups complements it in V, but none of these three subgroups of V is a conjugate of any other one, because V is Abelian. The quaternion group has normal subgroups of order 4 and 2 but is not a [semi]direct product. Schur's papers at the beginning of the 20th century introduced the notion of central extension to address examples such as C_4 and the quaternions. Proof The existence of a complement to a normal Hall subgroup H of a finite group G can be proved in the following steps: #By induction on the order of G, we can assume that it is true for any smaller group. #If H is abelian, then the existence of a complement follows from the fact that the cohomology group H2(G/H,H) vanishes (as H and G/H have coprime orders) and the fact that all complements are conjugate follows from the vanishing of H1(G/H,H). #If H is solvable, it has a nontrivial abelian subgroup A that is characteristic in H and therefore normal in G. Applying the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem to G/A reduces the proof to the case when H=A is abelian which has been done in the previous step. #If the normalizer N=NG(P) of every p-Sylow subgroup P of H is equal to G, then H is nilpotent, and in particular solvable, so the theorem follows by the previous step. #If the normalizer N=NG(P) of some p-Sylow subgroup P of H is smaller than G, then by induction the Schur‚ÄìZassenhaus theorem holds for N, and a complement of N‚à©H in N is a complement for H in G because G=NH.

He made his Serie A debut at the age of 17 on 22 October 2005, then also making his debut at the European level in the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Cup, scoring also two goals. His first Serie A goal came in an away league match played against Messina on 20 December 2006, and ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw: Paponi's equaliser goal, a reversed bicycle kick immediately dubbed as \\"scorpion kick\\", was saluted among the finest scored in the league season. Nevertheless, Paponi struggled to find space in the first team in the following 2007‚Äì08 season, and in January 2008 he accepted a loan move to Serie B's Cesena, where he scored two goals in 21 games. For the 2008‚Äì09 season he returned to Parma, then in Serie B, playing seven games and scoring twice, but in January 2009 he was loaned out again, this time to Rimini as part of the deal that brought then-Serie B topscorer Daniele Vantaggiato to join the gialloblu.

Paponi also became a financial burden of the club for his wage in 2013. Paponi only played once in 2011‚Äì12 Serie A. In June 2012, Paonessa was definitively under contract with Parma as well as Paponi to Bologna. In 2012‚Äì13 Paponi missed a few games due to injuries. However, his own quality had limited his chance to play: only 3 games in 2012‚Äì13 Serie A, all as substitutes. In April 2013 he left for Canada to have a trial with Montreal Impact. ;Montreal On 19 April 2013 Paponi joined Montreal Impact on loan until 31 December 2013.

It's building a fence at the top of the cliff, rather than being an ambulance at the bottom.\\" Involvement in Schoolies Week Schoolies week is the Red Frogs main event of the year in which they take part. Schoolies week is well known and criticised for the amount of drinking and acts of violence that occur during the 2-week period of celebrations and partying. The Red Frogs Crew have 6 main involvements in schoolies week: *\\"The Walkers\\" - Crew members who offer schoolies assistance whilst walking home from parties and celebrations *\\"The Talkers\\" - Crew members that hand out Red Frogs and promote safe partying *\\"Call Centre Operators\\" - Crew members take thousands of calls from youth in distress or who need assistance in their hotel rooms or situations *\\"The Chefs\\" - Crew members that cook pancakes in the early morning to provide breakfast, and also to help youths recover from the previous night of drinking *\\"The Cleaners\\" - Crew members who help clean schoolies hotel rooms/apartments from vomit and food *\\"The Stage Guys\\" - Crew members who help run the Red Frogs Stage, an entertainment centre throughout the nights Involvement throughout the University year The Red Frogs Crew starts involvement with the university year starting with Orientation Week. In an attempt to keep a good relationship with university students, Red Frog crew members have a stall during orientation week in which they handout approximately 60,000 Uni Planners, 10,000 donuts, 5,000 icy poles and 6 tonnes of Red Frogs. The Red Frogs Crew will also be found attending parties where they have 'Hydration Stations' - a stall set up to help keep university students hydrated throughout the night. The Red Frogs Crew also host many of their own events, such as coffee crawls, cooking pancakes for students at exam time, and hosting BBQ's.  Red Frogs Expansion  Red Frogs have since expanded internationally into countries such as New Zealand, South Africa, United Kingdom, Canada and USA. The model which first started in Australia has now become a blueprint for these countries as the vision to \\"Safeguard a Generation\\" is replicated by passionate locals.

It is the process of friction caused by scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, and rubbing away of materials. The intensity of abrasion depends on the hardness, concentration, velocity and mass of the moving particles. Abrasion generally occurs four ways.Westgate, L. G. (1907). Abrasion by Glaciers, Rivers, and Waves. The Journal of Geology, 15(2), 113-120.Monroe, James Stewart, Reed Wicander, & Richard W. Hazlett. (2011) Physical Geology: Exploring the Earth. Cengage Learning . pg 465,591 Glaciation slowly grinds rocks picked up by ice against rock surfaces.Bennett, Matthew M., & Neil F. Glasser. Glacial Geology: Ice Sheets and Landforms. (2011) Ch. 5 Glacial abrasion. John Wiley & Sons. Solid objects transported in river channels make abrasive surface contact with the bed and walls. Objects transported in waves breaking on coastlines cause abrasion. And, finally, abrasion can be caused by wind transporting sand or small stones against surface rocks. Abrasion, under its strictest definition, is commonly confused with attrition and sometimes hydraulic action. however, the latter less commonly so. Both abrasion and attrition refer to the wearing down of an object. Abrasion occurs as a result of two surfaces rubbing against each other resulting in the wearing down of one or both of the surfaces. However, attrition refers to the breaking off of particles (erosion) which occurs as a result of objects hitting against each other. Abrasion leads to surface-level destruction over time, whereas attrition results in more change at a faster rate. Today, the geomorphology community uses the term \\"abrasion\\" in a looser way, often interchangeably with the term \\"wear\\".Chatanantavet, P., & Parker, G. (2009). Physically based modeling of bedrock incision by abrasion, plucking, and macroabrasion. Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 114(F4). http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008JF001044/full In channel transport Abrasion in a stream or river channel occurs when the sediment carried by a river scours the bed and banks, contributing significantly to erosion. In addition to chemical weathering and the physical weathering of hydraulic action, freeze-thaw cycles (see frost weathering), and more, there is a suite of processes which have long been considered to contribute significantly to bedrock channel erosion include plucking, abrasion (due to both bedload and suspended load), solution, and cavitation.Whipple, K. X., Hancock, G. S., & Anderson, R. S. (2000). River incision into bedrock: Mechanics and relative efficacy of plucking, abrasion, and cavitation. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 112(3), 490-503. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c264/c8e0d4cdef47279e585c5a7c09d409c67f52.pdfAllan, J. D. & Castillo, M. M. (2007). Stream ecology: the structure and function of running waters. Springer Science & Business Media. . In terms of a Glacier, it is a similar principal; the moving of rocks over a surface wears it away with friction, digging a channel that, when the glacier moves away, is called a U-Shaped valley. Bedload transport consists of mostly larger clasts, which cannot be picked up by the velocity of the streamflow, rolling, sliding, and/or saltating (bouncing) downstream along the bed. Suspended load typically refers to smaller particles, such as silt, clay, and finer grain sands uplifted by processes of sediment transport. Grains of various sizes and composition are transported differently in terms of the threshold flow velocities required to dislodge and deposit them, as is modeled in the Hjulstr√∂m curve. These grains polish and scour the bedrock and banks when they make abrasive contact. In coastal erosion Abrasion platform in the Parque Natural del Estrecho, at the Strait of Gibraltar coast in Andalusia, Spain Coastal abrasion occurs as breaking ocean waves containing a sand and larger fragments erode the shoreline or headland. The hydraulic action of waves contributes heavily. This removes material, resulting in undercutting and possible collapse of unsupported overhanging cliffs. This erosion can threaten structure or infrastructure on coastlines, and the impact will very likely increase as global warming increases sea level rise.Zhang, K., Douglas, B. C., & Leatherman, S. P. (2004). Global warming and coastal erosion. Climatic Change, 64(1-2), 41. Seawalls are sometimes built-in defense, but in many locations, conventional coastal engineering solutions such as sea walls are increasingly challenged and their maintenance may become unsustainable due to changes in climate conditions, sea-level rise, land subsidence, and sediment supply.Temmerman, S., Meire, P., Bouma, T. J., Herman, P. M., Ysebaert, T., & De Vriend, H. J. (2013). Ecosystem-based coastal defense in the face of global change. Nature, 504(7478), 79. Abrasion platforms are shore platforms where wave action abrasion is a prominent process. If it is currently being fashioned, it will be exposed only at low tide, but there is a possibility that the wave-cut platform will be hidden sporadically by a mantle of beach shingle (the abrading agent). If the platform is permanently exposed above the high-water mark, it is probably a raised beach platform (aka, marine terrace), which is not considered a product of abrasion but may be undercut by abrasion as sea level rises. From glaciation Glacial abrasion is the surface wear achieved by individual clasts, or rocks of various sizes, contained within ice or by subglacial sediment as the glacier slides over bedrock (Krabbendam & Glasser 2011). Abrasion can crush smaller grains or particles and remove grains or multigrain fragments, but the removal of larger fragments is classified as plucking (or quarrying), the other major erosion source from glaciers. Plucking creates the debris at the base or sides of the glacier that causes abrasion. While plucking has generally been thought of as a greater force of geomorphological change, there is evidence that in softer rocks with wide joint spacing that abrasion can be just as efficient.Krabbendam, M., & Glasser, N. F. (2011). Glacial erosion and bedrock properties in NW Scotland: abrasion and plucking, hardness and joint spacing. Geomorphology, 130(3-4), 374-383. A smooth, polished surface is left behind by glacial abrasion, sometimes with glacial striations, which provide information about the mechanics of abrasion under temperate glaciers.Iverson, N. R. (1991). Morphology of glacial striae: implications for abrasion of glacier beds and fault surfaces. Geological Society of America Bulletin, 103(10), 1308-1316. From wind Much consideration has been given to the role of wind as an agent of geomorphological change on Earth and other planets (Greely & Iversen 1987). Aeolian processes involve wind eroding materials, such as exposed rock, and moving particles through the air to contact other materials and deposit them elsewhere. of these forces are notably similar to models in fluvial environments. Aeolian processes demonstrate their most notable consequences in arid regions of sparse and abundant unconsolidated sediments, such as sand. There is now evidence that bedrock canyons, landforms traditionally thought to evolve only from the fluvial forces of flowing water, may indeed be extended by the aeolian forces of wind, perhaps even amplifying bedrock canyon incision rates by an order of magnitude above fluvial abrasion rates.Perkins, J. P., Finnegan, N. J., & De Silva, S. L. (2015). Amplification of bedrock canyon incision by the wind. Nature Geoscience, 8(4), 305. Redistribution of materials by wind occurs at multiple geographic scales and can have important consequences for regional ecology and landscape evolution.Okin, G. S., D. A. Gillette, and J. E. Herrick. (2006). \\"Multi-scale controls on and consequences of aeolian processes in landscape change in arid and semi-arid environments.\\" Journal of Arid Environments 65.2: 253-275.

Career Kijak studied with the film scholar and John Cassavetes expert Ray Carney, as well as the late Mel Howard at Boston University's College of Communication. He wrote, directed and produced the feature film Never Met Picasso (1996) which starred Margot Kidder, Alexis Arquette and Don McKellar (with music by Kristin Hersh). It won awards for both Best Screenplay and Best Actor (for Arquette) at the 1997 Outfest film festival. Kijak followed that with the cult hit Cinemania (2002) (co-directing and co-producing with the German filmmaker Angela Christlieb), a documentary about five of the most manic-obsessive film-buffs in New York City. The film won the Golden Starfish Jury Award for Best Documentary at the 2002 Hamptons International Film Festival. His next film was a documentary on musician Scott Walker. The film, titled Scott Walker - 30 Century Man was executive produced by David Bowie, and featured Radiohead, Brian Eno, Sting, Damon Albarn and Jarvis Cocker, and provided a look inside Scott Walker‚Äôs creative process over a 40-year career. The film had its world premiere on October 31, 2006, at the 50th London Film Festival, and premiered internationally at the 2007 Berlin International Film Festival and became one of the most critically acclaimed documentaries released in the UK that year. In television, Kijak has directed episodes of the Bravo original series, Queer Eye, and the Sundance Channel's Big Ideas for a Small Planet. Stones in Exile, a film he directed that was commissioned by The Rolling Stones to tell the story of the making of their 1972 album Exile on Main St., had its world premiere at the 2010 Directors' Fortnight in Cannes, followed by broadcast premieres on BBC 1's Imagine, and on a special edition of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on NBC. On February 11, 2013, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Kijak would be directing a feature documentary about the biggest-selling boy band of all time, The Backstreet Boys, a film being produced by Mia Bays (who produced Kijak's Scott Walker film) and Pulse Films. We Are X, a documentary on the heavy metal band X Japan and its leader Yoshiki, was premiered in the World Documentary Competition at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Kijak remarked about the film \\"I might have to quit music films after this one.

It is represented on Corby Borough Council by one councillor.Corby Borough Council: Great Oakley Ward . Retrieved 10 November 2009 The population of the Great Oakley Ward of Corby Borough Council at the 2011 Census was 2,248. Great (and Little) Oakley lie in the upper reaches of the Harpers Brook on a narrow strip of limestone, sandstone and clay where the valley has cut down through the extensive boulder clay capped plateau. This permeable geology presumably provided a narrow strip of open pasture, the oak ley, along the valley within a broad tract of woodland on the boulder clay either side. The townships extended across the boulder clay to tributaries of the Harpers Brook on the south and of the Willow Brook on the north west, where it abutted extensive woodland which lay in the forest. History In 1086 there was one manor of Great Oakley held by Launcelin and in the 12th century this was held of the Honour of Huntingdon by de Houton. During the medieval period the main manor can be traced via various families, including the de Lyons in the 14th century. The manor was later divided but brought back together after 1495 by the Brooke family and much of Great Oakley has been in the ownership of the Brooke family, including the De Capell Brooke baronets, since then. The present lord of the manor is Hugh de Capell Brooke, who lives with his family in Great Oakley Hall, which was extensively renovated in the 1960s. The earliest enclosure recorded in Oakley is in 1505-6 when the Abbot of Pipewell enclosed 26 acres called Oldfald feld and expelled five people. In 1647 a dispute occurred with William Brighunt, keeper of the forest, for trespass by Thomas Brooke by taking conies from the common at Snatchall and collecting tithe wool from lambs that Brighunt had there. Thomas also took wood for his own use during 1625-1695. At the enclosure of the Rockingham Bailiwick in 1833, Great Oakley was considered to be part of Rockingham Forest. The South Fields were enclosed privately in 1786. A notebook contains great detail of the items to consider and ‚Äòerrors to avoid‚Äô; it lists the number of yardlands and beast commons, describes fencing and other costs, discussed what the tenants required, took advice from nearby parishes that had been recently enclosed (e. g. Brixworth), as well as giving retrospective information about cropping in the old enclosures and noting that conditions of tenancy had been to supply coal to the Hall. Great Oakley was also the home of the famous Jack Russell named Roger Moore. Present day The present day village is bisected by Great Oakley Park which surrounds the hall. The greater part of the village lies to the north, with Woodlands Lane (forming the rest of the village) to the south. In the centre of the village is the village hall. This was erected in 1921 by Sir Arthur R. de Capell Brooke for the villagers to use for social activities. Next to the hall is the old vicarage, in the grounds of which there is a large grass mound. Rumour has it that a vicar once had this made so that he could feel nearer to Heaven! The original village hall has now been replaced by a new hall adjacent to the cricket club off Lewin Road, behind Lovap Way. In the grounds of the Hall is St Michael's Church, Great Oakley, which was built of stone in the 13th century. The nave roof is built of Collyweston stone slate. Both the nave and the small tower, which houses three bells, were added to the church in the 16th and 17th centuries. The church register dates from 1718. Inside the church there are several monuments to the Brooke family, and the oak choir stalls are said to have come from the Cistercian abbey at Pipewell. The church is a grade II* listed building. Harpers Brook flows through the village and this stream was once the boundary of Rockingham Forest. There is a well in the village called Monk's Well. This was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and at one time the villagers used it as their water supply. It can still be seen, and is situated in the grounds of Bridge Farm in Brooke Road. The old school building remains opposite the old vicarage and the wall-mounted post box in Woodlands Lane may denote the old post office but there is no sign of the former public house or baker's shop. Although in recent years extensive new housing has been built on land heading towards Corby, much of Great Oakley remains unchanged. A preservation order exists on all trees and stone houses in the village, and this will help to ensure that the character of Great Oakley remains for future generations.

Located in Ayodhya, it is one of the most important temples in the city along with other temples such as Nageshwar Nath and the in-construction Ram Temple. Located in the middle of Ayodhya, 76 steps lead to the Hanumangarhi which is one of the most popular temple complexes of Hanuman in North India. It is a custom that before visiting Ram temple one should first pay visit to Lord Hanuman temple. The temple houses Hanuman's mother, Anjani, with a young Hanuman sitting on her lap. When Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after conquering Ravana, Hanumanji started living here. That is why it was named Hanumangarh or Hanuman Kot. From here, Hanumanji used to protect Ramkot. In the main temple, Pawansut sits in the lap of Mata Anjani. This huge temple and its residential complex is spread over 52 bighas. Many temples of the country including Vrindavan, Nashik, Ujjain, Jagannathpuri have assets, akharas and meetings of this temple. Hanuman Garhi temple is located near Ram Janmabhoomi. In 1855, the Nawab of Awadh saved the temple from destruction by Muslims. The Muslims thought Hanumangarhi had been built over a mosque. Historian Sarvepalli Gopal has said that the 1855 dispute was not for the Babri Masjid - Ram Temple site but for the Hanuman Garhi temple.

It was part of the Roman Curia. Effective 1 January 2017, the work of the Council was assumed by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development.http://gosc.pl/doc/3625382.Start-najnowszej-watykanskiej- dykasterii Description The Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus describes the work of the council as: *Art. 152 ‚Äî The Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers shows the solicitude of the Church for the sick by helping those who serve the sick and suffering, so that their apostolate of mercy may ever more effectively respond to people‚Äôs needs. *Art. 153 ‚Äî ¬ß 1. The Council is to spread the Church‚Äôs teaching on the spiritual and moral aspects of illness as well as the meaning of human suffering . Its tasks also include coordinating the activities of different dicasteries of the Roman Curia as they relate to health care. The Pontifical Council explains and defends the teachings of the Church on health issues. The Council also follows and studies programs and initiatives of health care policy at both international and national levels, with the goal of extracting its relevance and implications for the pastoral care of the Church. The office of President was left vacant following the death of Archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski in July 2016. Monsignor Jean-Marie Musivi Mupendawatu was the last Secretary of the council. The council was suppressed effective 1 January 2017 with the creation of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development with Cardinal Turkson as the inaugural prefect. Work with AIDS patients In November 1989 at the annual conference of the Pontifical Council at the Vatican, recognition was given to an American priest from Massachusetts, Rev James Martin Graham, who was the director of the Archdiocese of Hartford's Office of AIDS Ministry, who pleaded for better communication efforts between the Church and governmental health agencies to share information to better combat AIDS. As a result of his proposal, Graham was appointed by then Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini as the director of the new International Christian AIDS Network (ICAN). As a follow up to this appointment, Archbishop Angelini traveled to the United States in June 1990 and visited Graham's Sts. Martin & James Respite, a hospice and living facility for HIV-positive and AIDS patients in Waterbury, Connecticut, where a 24-hour care residence was named for him. Archbishop Angelini met with several of the patients and gave Father Graham a silver stalk of wheat that would serve as the handle on the door of the Respite's Chapel tabernacle. In an interview with American television, the Archbishop remarked that Graham's Respite was recognized by the Pontifical Council as a model facility that should be followed to make treatment and spiritual care of HIV-positive and AIDS patients available for all. The work of ICAN was short-lived, however, for Father Graham died in 1997. Monsignor Mupendawatu said, in an interview on Thursday, July 21, 2011 with the semi- official Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, that a papal foundation affiliated with the Pontifical Council, that is dedicated largely to AIDS patients, may expand its services to include a global program of distributing anti-AIDS drugs. The initiative would respond to a shortage of antiretroviral drugs and other drugs in poorer countries, where the vast majority of AIDS patients receive no adequate treatment. Mupendawatu is a delegate to the Good Samaritan Foundation, established by Pope John Paul II in 2004, to provide economic support to the sick who are most in need, particularly those suffering from AIDS. Mupendawatu said the Foundation planned to strengthen its activity, particularly in Africa, by increasing its promotion of donations of pharmaceutical and medical material, and by working more closely with local Catholic leaders to place the Church in the forefront of the care for AIDS patients. To favor these efforts, he said, the foundation may open offices on every continent, which would function in coordination with the central office at the Vatican in Rome. \\"The foundation is also studying the possibility of creating its own 'pharmaceutical center' which would allow the collection and distribution of medicines in poor countries,\\" he said. The center would work in cooperation with other church agencies. Mupendawatu said that while more than 25 percent of the global health care to AIDS patients is provided by Catholic institutions, the church needs to do even more in the face of the epidemic, which infects about 7,000 additional people each day. One of the church's priorities is to help make \\"universal and free access to treatment\\" a reality for all those infected with AIDS, he said. Today, only about 5 percent of people with AIDS patients receive adequate care, he said. \\"It is enough to realize that the majority of AIDS patients in Africa live on a dollar a day and cannot afford any treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to reach the essential goal of no-cost drugs,\\" he said. Mupendawatu said the church's insistence that education in responsible sexuality be at least a part of any anti-AIDS strategy has found appreciation in scientific circles, in fact, contrary to what the public has been led to believe. The church's position is that effective prevention of AIDS must include the abandonment of high-risk behavior and the adoption of a \\"balanced sexuality\\" based on permanent monogamy- the inclusion of total premarital chastity and lasting full marital fidelity, he said. He noted that Pope Benedict XVI's monthly prayer intention for July evoked the church's commitment to AIDS sufferers: \\"That Christians may ease the physical and spiritual sufferings of those who are sick with AIDS, especially in the poorest countries.\\" List of Presidents  *Cardinal Fiorenzo Angelini (16 February 1985 - 31 December 1996) *Cardinal Javier Lozano Barrag√°n (7 January 1997 - 18 April 2009) *Archbishop Zygmunt Zimowski (18 April 2009 ‚Äì 12 July 2016) See also *Catholic Church and health care *Dolentium Hominum References External links *Pontifical Council for Health Pastoral Care Category:International medical and health organizations Category:Pontifical councils Category:Christian organizations established in 1985 * Category:Former dicasteries ","title":"Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers"},{"id":"8113925","text":"A Bullet in the Heart (, translit.

They were one of the few surviving bands from the Spanish underground extreme music scene of the nineties. History Machetazo were formed in A Coru√±a, Spain in 1994 as a side project of two other death metal bands from the area. Initially, they were more noisecore-oriented than grindcore. They recorded two demos, 46 Cabezas Aplastadas por un Yunque Oxidado in 1995, and Realmente Disfruto Comiendo Cad√°veres in 1997. The latter was an international underground success, and in 1999 was remastered by the American label Fudgeworthy Records. At this point Machetazo stopped being a side project and became a band in its own right, although line-up problems forced them to continue with only two members. They recorded their first album Carne de Cementerio in 1999, which was released by Razorback Records. After this they released numerous split singles. With Dopi as the sole surviving original member together with the new guitarist Rober, Machetazo recorded their second full length, Trono de Huesos (2002). In this work the band gives tribute to the seminal grind sound in a work in the vein of bands like Carcass or Repulsion. After the recording of Trono de Huesos Machetazo created a more stable line-up, that still exists today: Dopi (drums and vocals); Carlos \\"Cadaver\\" (bass and vocals); and Rober (guitar). After testing this line-up with two singles, Machetazo released their third full length in 2005, Sinfon√≠as del Terror Ciego, a concept album about the Spanish film maker Amando de Ossorio. This record brought them to a wider audience than ever before and 2006 was a year of intense touring and projects. They released a split single with Total Fucking Destruction on the American label Relapse in 2006. In late 2008, Carlos Cadaver left the band. Santi from the grindcore band Nashgul, is now the new bass player. Members * Dopi - drums, vocals (1994-2014) * Rober - guitar, bass (2000-2014) *Iago - bass (2013-2014) Past members *Carlos - bass, vocals (2001-2008) *Chinin - bass, vocals (1994-2001) *Ernesto - drums (1994-1999) *Nacho - guitars (1999-2001) *Gonso - guitar, vocals (1994-1999) Side projects The bandmembers of Machetazo have developed some side projects through the years: Dopi is the drummer, bassist and guirarist of Deadmask, a classic doom band influenced by Saint Vitus, Pentagram and Trouble. The other member in the band is the vocalist Nuria. Deadmask released Under Luciferian Wings, their first MCD in November 2008 with the label PsycheDOOMelic Records. Dopi is also the vocalist of Dishammer an old school Thrash crust band with members of Moho, Looking For An Answer and Disnation. They released Vintage Addiction, their first LP in December 2008. Rober is the guitarist and bassist of Banished From Inferno, an old school death metal trio. The other band members are Roger \\"Rogga\\" Johansson, vocalist of Paganizer, Ribspreader or Putrevore; and the drummer Phlegeton, member of Wormed, Human Mincer, God√ºs or Unsane Crisis. They released Banished From Inferno, their first MCD in August 2008 with the label Ibex Moon Records. Santi is also vocalist in the grindcore band Nashgul, although this is not a side project. Carlos Cadaver was the only member in Machetazo without ended side projects, although he currently is the bassist of the heavy metal band Sister Moon. Labels Machetazo have released material mainly on two labels: Razorback Records has released its three albums on CD, while the Asturian label Throne Records has released them in a vinyl format. But Machetazo has also had its material released on many small underground international labels, like Al Pacino Records, Scurvy Records, First Blood Family, Frigidity Records, Goryfied Productions, Hells Headbangers, Irony Records, Last House On The Right Records, Relapse, Sterilized Decay Records and Upground Records.

Based on the 1995 novel by Dorothy West and written for television by West and Lisa Jones, it stars Halle Berry, Eric Thal, and Lynn Whitfield, and was produced by Oprah Winfrey's production company, Harpo Productions. The story touches on the subjects of marriage, race, prejudice, class, and family in 1950s Martha's Vineyard. The film aired on ABC on February 22 and February 23, 1998. Plot Shelby Cole (Halle Berry) returns to Martha's Vineyard and the Cole family home, in a section of town known as 'The Oval', to wed her white fianc√©, jazz pianist and composer Meade Howell (Eric Thal). While her black high-society parents initially accept the pair, even arranging the wedding to be held at the mansion, they have growing misgivings as to the pair's ability to withstand the racial prejudice of the time, only made stronger after Meade admits that his own middle-class parents will not be attending the wedding because of their prejudice against their daughter-in-law-to-be. Through frequent flashbacks throughout, we see the racial, societal and class choices made by Shelby's white great-grandmother on her mother's side (Shirley Knight), her grandparents and parents to insure the family's standing, even while those choices may have robbed them of the very happiness they sought. While Shelby dismisses and even rebuffs much of their advice, her own doubts grow as she and Meade go through their own current experiences of racism and racial expectations. Seeing her growing misgivings, Lute McNeil (Carl Lumbly), local architect, father and neighbor of the Coles, sees an opportunity to try to win Shelby's heart, having loved her from afar for some time. With Lute's persistent, sometimes unwanted, attentions, Shelby starts to question her marrying Meade. After a racist incident at a local restaurant, Shelby even confesses to Meade that she doesn't want to spend the rest of her life defending their relationship and asks him to give her time to finally decide. Meanwhile, Shelby's mother Corinne (Lynn Whitfield) is battling her own demons within her marriage. Through the flashbacks, we see that her doctor husband Clark (Michael Warren) married her not for love, but for her lighter-skinned looks and status. In the present, Corinne discovers that Clark is having an affair, planning to leave her for his longtime nurse-assistant, Rachel (Charlayne Woodard) after the wedding. However, his inability to resolve his guilt about his marriage and children over the years, and several badly-timed phone calls during the wedding to her leave Rachel sadly resigned to the belief that he will never leave Corinne and she leaves him to marry another. On hearing this, Clark decides to try to spark the love in his marriage again with Corinne. At the same time, Shelby's sister, Liz (Cynda Williams) has her own tribulations with her darker-skinned husband, Dr. Lincoln Odis (Richard Brooks). Lincoln's parents were disinvited from Liz and Lincoln's own wedding by Corinne. Corinne cites Lincoln's parents' discomfort with the local community as the reason, but in actuality Corinne disliked Lincoln's parents' working-class status. That act remains a true bone of contention between Lincoln and Corinne, and he initially refuses to attend Shelby's wedding. With prodding, however, from Liz re-affirming her love for him and explaining that her mother's actions, while horrid, were not at all her own feelings, he finally agrees to come. Meanwhile, Lute has insisted his wife (Patricia Clarkson) give him a divorce because of her family's prejudice against him and her own ambivalence. Lute's wife has returned from New York to plead her case for reconciliation, suspecting that his request for a speedy divorce in Mexico is spurred by his desire to wed another woman. Lute in a rage forces her out of their home and tries to drive her to the ferry out of town, but in the process accidentally hits his youngest daughter with his car. The noise of their argument has brought out the surrounding neighbors, including Shelby, who, shocked by Lute's vehemence, feels that she 'finally can see who Lute really is', accepting that good character and heart, not race or class, make the human being and turns her heart back to Meade. The two marry in the end.

It can be divided into: *The anterior renal fascia, also called Gerota's fascia (after Dimitrie Gerota) *The posterior renal fascia, also called Zuckerkandl's fascia or fascia retrorenalis The renal fascia separates the adipose capsule of kidney from the overlying pararenal fat. The deeper layers below the renal fascia are, in order, the adipose capsule (or perirenal fat), the renal capsule and finally the parenchyma of the renal cortex. The spaces about the kidney are typically divided into three compartments: the perinephric space and the anterior and posterior pararenal spaces. Anterior renal fascia * Anterior attachment: Passes anterior to the kidney, renal vessels, abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava and fuses with the anterior layer of the renal fascia of the opposite kidney. * Posterior attachment: Fuses with the psoas fascia and side of the body of the vertebrae. * Superior attachment: The anterior and posterior layers fuse at the upper pole of the kidney and then split to enclose the adrenal gland. At the upper part of the adrenal gland, they again fuse to form the suspensory ligament of the adrenal gland and fuse with the diaphragmatic fascia. * Inferior attachment: The layers do not fuse. The posterior layer descends downwards and fuses with the iliac fascia. The anterior layer blends with the connective tissue of the iliac fossa. The anterior fascia and posterior fascia fuse laterally to form the lateroconal fascia which fuses with the transverse fascia. In front of the fascia anterior to the perinephric space (also known as Toldt's fascia) is the anterior pararenal space, which contains the pancreas, ascending and descending colon, and second through fourth parts of the duodenum. The fascia posterior to the perinephric space was named Zuckerkandl's fascia. Posterior to this lies the posterior paranephric space which does not contain any abdominal organs. Posterior renal fascia Zuckerkandl's fascia or fascia retrorenalis is a fibrous sheath covering the posterior side of the kidney. It constitutes the posterior layer of the renal fascia and was first described by Emil Zuckerkandl in 1883.

The breed is a scenthound, originally used to hunt large game. Other names include Bosnian Rough-haired Hound and Bosnian Rough-coated Hound. These names refer to the texture of the shaggy coat, usually called broken- haired or hard in English dog fancier jargon. History The former name given to the breed was Illyrian Hound, referring to a pre-Slavic people of the area. Today's breed is descended from indigenous dog types, crossed with an Italian gun dog in the 1890s. Translation of a piece first published as: Provides significant additional background material on the ancestry of the breed. \\"Local hunters, wanting to produce an efficient scent hound, developed this breed in the nineteenth century, using the available stock of dogs.\\"Barak breed website, in Bosnian and English The early type of today's smaller Istrian Shorthaired Hound may also have contributed to the Bosnian Coarse- haired Hound. The Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound was first recognised by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 1965 under the name of \\"Illyrian Hound\\". The name was changed to more accurately describe its area of origin in Bosnia. The breed is in Group 6, Scenthounds, Section 1.1 Large-sized Hounds, and is breed number 155. It is also recognised by the United Kennel Club (US) as the \\"Barak\\", in the Scenthound Group. The breed is not recognised by any other major kennel clubs in the English speaking world, although many minor kennel clubs, internet dog registry businesses, and rare breed registries promote and register it as a unique pet.  Description  A Bosnian Coarse- haired Hound from 1915.  Appearance  The most striking feature of the Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound is its shaggy, hard coat of yellowish (wheaten or red) or greyish colours, often with a white blaze on its head along with other white marks. The standard calls for a body length ten percent greater than height; these proportions are given to differentiate the Bosnian Coarse-haired Hound from other hounds of the area which are \\"a bit low on leg\\" Height ranges from 43‚Äì55 cm (17‚Äì22 in) at the withers, and weight is between 16‚Äì27 kg (35‚Äì60 lb). The dog normally carries its tail curved slightly upward, and its face has a bushy moustache and beard.  Temperament  The breed standard describes its behaviour as lively, as well as courageous and persistent.

Wessig was 2.01 metres tall and, while he was competing, weighed 88 kilograms (6' 7\\", 194 lbs). Shortly before the 1980 Olympics, he surprisingly became East German champion, setting a new personal best result of 2.30 metres and was subsequently nominated for the East German Olympic team. 1980 Olympics At the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, the 21-year-old was thus amongst the mild favourites, but the heavy favorite was the defending champion, Jacek Wszo≈Ça, of Poland: at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Wszola had established a new Olympic record of 2.25 metres. Early in the 1980 outdoor season, Wszola set a new world record of 2.35 on Sunday 25 May (in Eberstadt, Germany), and this mark was tied the next day by 18-year-old West German Dietmar M√∂genburg, at a competition in Rehlingen, Germany. Because of the western nations' boycott of the Moscow Olympics, M√∂genburg did not compete. Of the 16 finalists in the men's high jump (all having qualified with jumps of 2.21 on 31 July), thirteen used the Fosbury Flop style, and three used the classic straddle.http://www.reachoutmichigan.org/funexperiments/agesubject/lessons/newton/high.html Wessig not only out-dueled Wszo≈Ça for the gold during the finals on 1 August, the two shattered the 1976 mark several times, with clearances at 2.27, 2.29, and 2.31. Wessig began the competition at 2.15, and was flawless until 2.29, when he needed two attempts. That proved to be the decisive height: of the 7 men who cleared (the, then new Olympic Record of) 2.27, only 4 managed to scale 2.29. Those four, the Polish champion versus the entire East German team of Wessig, 18-year-old sensation J√∂rg Freimuth, and 22-year-old Henry Lauterbach, would now battle for the medals. With the other three men having all cleared 2.29 on their first attempts, Wessig's first miss at that height dropped him to fourth place, out of the medals. But, he leaped back into first place, all alone, with his first attempt clearance of 2.31. Wessig then out- jumped the Pole at 2.33 to secure the gold medal. Wessig cleared on his second attempt, the Pole just barely brushing the bar off on his third (final) attempt. Wessig continued to jump, alone, setting a new world record with his jump of 2.36 metres. He set the new record on his second attempt, with a sensational clearance. (Wessig's duel with Wszo≈Ça can be seen on YouTube, \\"1980 Moscow Olympics, Mens High Jump\\".) Wessig, having taken 11 jumps during the competition through 2.36, then took three attempts at 2.38. He thereby became the first high jumper who had managed to improve on the Mens High Jump world record at the Olympic Games. The previous world record holder, Jacek Wszo≈Ça from Poland, won the silver medal. Wessig's effort in Moscow was the acme of his career: his world record would stand for three years, and his Olympic record was broken at the 1988 games in Seoul. Later life After the Olympic Games, Wessig tried his luck as a decathlete (best performance: 8015 points, 23 May 1983 in Neubrandenburg; the equivalent of 7974 points according to the scale introduced in 1985). He turned back to the high jump following frequent injuries. In 1985, he came in second at the World Cup. In 1986, he reached seventh place at the European Championships. He became East German champion again 1988 and 1989. Since the end of his active athletics career, he has been running an enterprise in L√ºbstorf-Rugensee, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern which sells sport equipment, sport and leisure systems, as well as park and garden systems. He married the long jumper Christine Schima (best performance: 6.96 metres, 1984; seventh place at the 1982 European Championships).

Squillante also worked as an assassin for mob boss Albert \\"Mad Hatter\\" Anastasia. Squillante was born to Luigi and Bedelia Alberti, one of two sons, the other being Nunzio and seven sisters. He stood at 5-foot-2 and weighed 130 pounds. He married Theresa Scialabba in 1949 and fathered one child, Bedelia. He divorced Theresa in 1951 and married Olivia Hughes and fathered two daughters with her, Donna and Olivia. He is the uncle to mobster Jerry Mancuso. In 1963, Government informant Joe Valachi claimed that Squillante participated in the 1957 slaying of Anastasia underboss Frank \\"Don Cheech\\" Scalise. After the murder, Scalise's brother Joe publicly declared that he would avenge Frank's death. However, the Gambino family did not support Joe's declaration, possibly due to Anastasia's opposition. As a result, Joe was forced into hiding for several months until the family ostensibly forgave him. On September 7, 1957, according to Valachi, Squillante invited Joe to his house. Once Joe arrived, Squillante and several others murdered him, dismembered his body, loaded the remains onto one of Squillante's garbage trucks, and dumped them. In fall 1960, Squillante was indicted on extortion charges. Reportedly, the Gambino family worried that Squillante could not handle the upcoming trial and probable prison sentence. So, to \\"put him out of his misery,\\" the family ordered Squillante's death. On September 23, 1960, Squillante disappeared. According to some accounts, Squillante was handcuffed live to the steering wheel of a rusty Chevrolet and the car was moved into a baling press type compactor. The metal was then melted down in an open hearth furnace. However, some newspaper accounts of that period claim that Squillante was actually seen on September 30 at 2 a.m. driving around the Bronx neighborhood in his brother-in-law's car. In any case, Squillante's body was never found and no murder suspects were ever arrested. See also *List of fugitives from justice who disappeared Further reading *Capeci, Jerry.

His nickname was related to a childhood accident after a falling brick from a construction site had crushed his right hand, resulting in the loss of two fingers. Self-conscious of his deformed hand, White would wear a white glove in public with cotton stuffed in the empty fingers. In 1919, he was convicted of robbery and served a prison sentence in Joliet Correctional Center until winning parole within four years. An early member and much respected gunman of Johnny Torrio-Al Capone organization, White would be declared a public enemy in the Chicago Crime Commission's first published report in 1923 of those \\"who are constantly in conflict with the law\\" along with James \\"Mad Bomber\\" Belcastro, Edward O'Donnell, Jake Guzik, and Al Capone. The following year, White was twice convicted for the murder of Forest Park policeman Edward Pflaume and, despite being released on appeal by the State Supreme Court; he was imprisoned for several years. Following his release, White returned to work for the Chicago Outfit as a labor racketeer competing against rival mobster Roger Touhy (eventually planning the murder of Touhy supporter Teamsters International Vice President Paddy Barrel). In 1933, White and Frankie Rio were supposedly sent to Florida by Paul Ricca to oversee the assassination of Anton Cermak, appearing with Franklin Roosevelt, by Giuseppe Zangara. However, they were held in custody and searched by Chicago police while waiting with politician Harry Hockstein in the main terminal of a Chicago train station on February 13. According to the testimony of Roger Touhy to the Illinois Parole Board in 1957, White and Rio began shooting at Zangara however hit several bystanders instead before disappearing into the crowd dressed in police uniforms of the Cicero Police Department.AmericanMafia.com - Feature Articles 200 at www.americanmafia.com In May 1933, he was convicted on weapons charges and served a year in jail as well as issued a $300 fine although an appeal was later taken. His body was found in his Oak Park apartment, suffering gunshot wounds to the head and body, after a gunfight with two unidentified gunmen seen fleeing from the building on the night of January 3, 1934. He would later be portrayed by Gavin MacLeod as \\"Three Fingers\\" Jack White on the original television series The Untouchables. The Farrell Letter In a 1935 letter to the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, amateur investigator Frank Farrell identified White as the organizer of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. According to Farrell, White perpetrated the massacre as a revenge against Frank Gusenberg and Peter Gusenberg for the murder of his cousin William Davern Jr the previous year. Farrell's theory is generally discarded, mainly on the grounds that there is strong evidence that White had still been in jail at the time of the massacre. http://www.myalcaponemuseum.com/id173.htm Further reading *Schoenberg, Robert J.

He was a former Keeper and Deputy Director of the National Gallery in London. Life Born in 1918, Gould was the son of Rupert Gould, the restorer of John Harrison‚Äôs chronometers, and Muriel Estall. Gould was educated at Kingswood House preparatory school, near Epsom, and then at Westminster School. After leaving school he studied at the Courtauld Institute. During the Second World War he served as Pilot Officer Gould in R.A.F. Intelligence, first in Egypt from 1941 to 1943 and then in Normandy, France. In early 1945 he was transferred to the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies, which was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after World War II. The group of approximately 400 service members and civilians, known commonly as the \\"Monuments Men\\", worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been stolen by the Nazis or hidden for safekeeping. After the war, he joined the National Gallery staff in 1946 and worked there until his retirement in 1987. He was Keeper and Deputy Director for the last five years of his tenure. He was a prolific author, publishing many books and articles during his career. In 1970, Gould established that the National Gallery's Portrait of Pope Julius II was the prime version by Raphael and not a copy, as had previously been thought. He was also responsible for a new attribution of a work to Michelangelo. In his last years Gould lived with his younger sister Jocelyne Stacey in the village of Thorncombe, Dorset. He developed a brain tumour and, after a short illness, died on 7 April 1994. Gould never married and was survived by Jocelyne. A collection of Gould's large-format black-and- white photographs of Islamic architecture in Cairo, taken during World War II, is in the RIBA library. Gould was portrayed during his childhood in the 2000 Channel 4 television drama about Harrison's chronometers, Longitude.

Biography Born in Naples, he was the son of Roberto Sanseverino and a noble girl from a Salerno family. Fernando Sanseverino was the last of the Sanseverino Princes of Salerno. He fought for Emperor Charles V in Germany and France. He took part to Charles' incoronation in Bologna (1530), and was also present at the Conquest of Tunis (1535). He was one of the imperial leaders in the fourth war against Francis I of France and fought at the battle of Ceresole (1544). Returning to Naples, he clashed with the Spanish viceroy Pedro de Toledo, due to his opposition to the institution of Holy Inquisition tribunals in the Kingdom of Naples. He therefore moved to France at the court of King Henry II, embracing the Huguenot faith. His Italian fiefs were given to the Gonzaga family. Ferdinando Sanseverino died at Avignon, in France, in 1568. Main accomplishments He was a passionate supporter of contemporary theatre, and had one built within his palace in Naples. His refusal to accept the Inquisition inside his possession in Salerno created a break between him and the Spanish government in southern Italy. Mainly as a consequence of this, Fernando Sanseverino was forced to exile in France. There, he organized a naval attack of French ships against Naples and Salerno, but it failed because the allied Turkish fleet didn't show up. His legacy in the Principality of Salerno was to bring to the southern Italian city (and the surrounding area) the ideas of the Italian Renaissance.

Licensed to Flagstaff, Arizona, United States, the station serves the Flagstaff area. The station is currently owned by Yavapai Broadcasting Corporation. KVNA is also heard on FM translator K284BO at 104.7 MHz broadcasting from Mt. Elden and serving the greater Flagstaff area, giving the station the \\"Sunny 104.7\\" identification. KVNA has been granted an FCC construction permit to move to a different transmitter site and increase the night power to 70 watts. History KEOS Today's KVNA started as KEOS, which used the slogan \\"Service in Sound in Northern Arizona\\" in the 1950s and 1960s. The station was owned by Flagstaff businessman Jack Bird and licensed to Thunderbird Broadcasting Company; the call letters stood for the initials of the first owner, E.O. Smith. KEOS (\\"Chaos\\") was a 1,000-watt daytimer signing off at sunset each day on the 1290 AM frequency. In 1963, the second radio station to operate in Flagstaff failed. KGPH signed on December 6, 1950, from studios in the Weatherford Hotel. The station would relocate from 1230 kHz to 690 in 1953. KGPH was bought by a part-owner of Phoenix's KOY in April 1956; the new owners changed the callsign to KVNA. In June 1963, KVNA was sold to Frontier Television for $95,000. KVNA was described as defunct by that September, and in October, KEOS filed to take over the superior 24-hour facilities that belonged to KVNA. The application was approved in 1966, but it was not until the station completed construction of its new studio facilities, on September 8, 1969, that it moved to 690. The new KEOS broadcast with 1,000 watts day and 500 watts night, DA-2. The station later changed its call sign to KZKZ after it was sold in 1981. KVNA Last logo under News/Talk format After Communications Ltd. (Ed Raabe and Paul Seyler) purchased the station in 1986, they changed the call sign from KZKZ to KVNA (returning the callsign to the frequency for the first time since 1963), and paired it with a new FM station at 97.5 MHz (KVNA-FM). On July 14, 1988, the station that had been recognized as Northern Arizona's news and sports station, KCLS at 600 kHz, shut down when its owner opted to convert the land into a mobile home park. KVNA moved to acquire on-air talent, including the former KCLS general manager, and sports rights including Los Angeles Dodgers baseball and Flagstaff High School football. In the mid-1990s, under new ownership, KVNA would acquire the dormant KCLS license in order to relocate KVNA to 600 kHz. On December 30, 2014, the \\"Sunny\\" AC format of KVNA-FM moved to KVNA and its FM translator as \\"Sunny 104.7\\". KVNA flipped to sports talk in 2019.

Jones (March 9, 1846January 7, 1935) was an American lawyer, politician, jurist, and law professor. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives in the 48th Congress, and a justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Biography Born in the Town of Union, in Rock County, Wisconsin Territory. His father and mother had migrated to the Wisconsin Territory from Western Pennsylvania and Western New York, respectively. His father, William Jones, died in 1855, and his mother then married Levi Leonard, a pioneer of Rock County. Jones was raised on a farm and attended the Evansville Seminary, in Evansville, Wisconsin. He then taught at the school for three years to pay for his university education. He graduated from the literary department of the University of Wisconsin in 1870, and then from the law department in 1871. After leaving the university, he studied law in the office of William Freeman Vilas and was admitted to the State Bar of Wisconsin that year. Near the end of 1871, he began practicing law in Portage, Wisconsin, but within a year moved to Madison. While in Madison, he went through a series of partnerships, with Alden Sprague Sanborn, A. C. Parkinson, F. J. Lamb, and E. Ray Stevens. In November 1872, Jones was elected district attorney for Dane County, Wisconsin. He was then re-elected in 1874. In 1882, he was elected to the 48th Congress (March 4, 1883 ‚Äì March 3, 1885) on the Democratic Party ticket in Wisconsin's 3rd congressional district. He was defeated seeking re-election in 1884. In Congress, he served on the House Committee on War Claims, and served as acting Chairman when the chairman was unavailable with a long illness. left Jones returned to Madison and became a professor of law at the University of Wisconsin for the next thirty years of his life. He remained involved in local affairs and government, serving as City Attorney in 1891, and as chairman of the first Wisconsin Tax Commission in 1897 and 1898. He also remained active with the Wisconsin Democratic Party. He was chairman of the Democratic State convention in 1892, and represented Wisconsin as a delegate to the 1896 Democratic National Convention at Indianapolis, where he was chosen to nominate Edward S. Bragg for President. In 1920, he was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court by Governor Emanuel L. Philipp, to fill the vacancy created by the death of justice John B. Winslow. In April 1922, Jones was elected to fill the remainder of Winslow's term, which expired in 1926. He did not seek re-election in 1925, and in January 1926 he was replaced by his former law partner E. Ray Stevens. Jones returned to the practice of law. Personal life and family Jones married Olive L. Hoyt in December 1873. They had one daughter together. After the death of his first wife in 1906, he married Katharine McDonald, who survived him. After thirty years as a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, he was conferred a LL.D. in 1916.

Kabat Elvin Abraham Kabat (September 1, 1914 ‚Äì June 16, 2000) was an American biomedical scientist and one of the founding fathers of modern quantitative immunochemistry. Kabat was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1977 and the National Medal of Science in 1991. He is the father of Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founding director of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. He was the president of the American Association of Immunologists from 1965 to 1966, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He laid the foundations of the Kabat numbering scheme, a scheme for the numbering of amino acid residues in antibodies based upon variable regions. In 1969, he started collecting and aligning amino acid sequences of human and mouse Bence Jones proteins and immunoglobulin light chains in 1969. In 1995 he was awarded the American Association of Immunologists Lifetime Achievement Award. Work Kabat was instrumental in the discovery of the structural and genetic basis for the remarkable specificity of antibodies. Kabat first demonstrated that antibodies are gamma globulins. He characterized the size and stunning heterogeneity of antibody-combining sites. Kabat and his coworkers determined the structures of the major blood group antigens, the embryonic-stage-specific carbohydrate antigens and the carbohydrate markers of leukocyte (white blood cell). Some of his published work include: * Life Kabat's parents arrived in the United States from Eastern Europe toward the end of the 19th century. (The family changed their last name from Kabatchnick to Kabat.) Elvin began high school in New York City at the age of 12 and completed it in three years. He started at City College of New York at the age of 15 and graduated in 1932 with a major in chemistry at age 18. In January 1933, Kabat was already working in Michael Heidelberger‚Äôs laboratory doing routine lab chores at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. Kabat started work on his Ph.D. in the Department of Biochemistry, taking most courses at night, and completed his Ph.D. under Heidelberger in only four years. Kabat did postdoctoral work with Arne Tiselius and Kai Pederson in Uppsala, Sweden, to learn the new methods of ultracentrifugation and electrophoresis. He returned to New York City to take up a position as an instructor of pathology at Cornell University Medical College, served for three years before moving uptown and spent the main part of his career at Columbia University. Personal life In 1942, Kabat married Sally Lennick, a young Canadian art student. They had nine children, one of whom is the American mindfulness teacher and developer of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) Jon Kabat-Zinn. References External links *Elvin A.

It was originally released by 4AD on June 25, 1990 in the United Kingdom and in 1992 on 4AD/Rykodisc in the United States. History Livonia is the debut LP by Livonia, Michigan's His Name Is Alive (or HNIA). Frontman Warren Defever began recording on a 4-track recorder in his parent's basement while still in high school. As a result, this album is made up of material originally recorded from 1985 through 1989, rough versions of which appeared in 1988 on a self-released cassette called I Had Sex With God. In a 2006 interview, Defever recounts that he sent the cassette to 4AD label president Ivo Watts-Russell in 1988, who initially felt that Defever and his band \\"needed a lot of work.\\" Ivo also said he wasn't interested in signing any more American bands, due to the difficulty of time zone differences and finding US distribution. He also suggested that Defever try Rough Trade's US branch. Defever responded that he had already been rejected by that label, and continued to submit cassettes to 4AD, with revised and improved versions of the songs appearing on each new tape. Over time, Ivo and his This Mortal Coil partner John Fryer felt they could actually mix Defever's home recordings into something that 4AD could release, and the album finally appeared in the summer of 1990. Due to Ivo and Fryer's contribution, along with other superficial similarities, HNIA were often compared to This Mortal Coil during their early years. The recordings originally consisted of Defever providing the bulk of the music, with Angie Carozzo providing vocals. Once Defever met Karin Oliver in college, he recruited her to become the band's primary vocalist. The album still credits Carozzo as a member, although very few of her vocals remain in the finished product (tracks 10 and 11), and she left the band shortly after the album's release. Track listing The album was only available in the United States as an import until 1992, when Rykodisc reissued the album on CD, with an instrumental bonus track called \\"Livonia\\" appearing at the end of the album. The track was only available on the Rykodisc pressing and was not included on any subsequent 4AD reissues.

In the interview referenced above, Defever said the strings project was originally conceived as a joke while still signed to 4AD. He tried to convince the label that he had originally intended the album to be done with strings and he should be given the chance to re-record the album as \\"originally intended.\\" 4AD actually allowed Defever to move forward with the project, but has refused to release the recordings. Defever re-recorded the project sometime after leaving the label, although details are scarce. It was actually first released as disc 5 of the Cloud Box 10-CD box set on Time Stereo in 2004, under the name Mystery Spot. While Defever gave detailed notes about each CD of this set, his notes on Mystery Spot only said \\"I don't wanna talk about it, but once you listen you can figure it out, if you're smart.\\" Defever also said his intentions for releasing the project was to show 4AD that there was still interest in Livonia in America, where the label is not keeping the album (along with the rest of HNIA's 4AD catalog) in print in the United States, despite nothing preventing them from doing so. The strings CD release was a very limited edition; only 100 copies were made, which sold out very quickly. It is now currently available as a paid MP3 download from the Silver Mountain Media website.

It was released by Universal International and is a sequel to their 1941 hit, Buck Privates. This film marks the final role of veteran actor Nat Pendleton and the film debut of Russ Conway (in the role of an unnamed medic). Plot After serving in Europe during World War II, Herbie Brown (Lou Costello) and Slicker Smith (Bud Abbott) return to the United States aboard a troop ship. Also on board is their old nemesis, Sgt. Collins (Nat Pendleton). As the ship nears New York, Collins and his superiors search the men's belongings for contraband. Herbie accidentally activates a time bomb, made to look like a camera, that he picked up as a souvenir and has to throw it out the porthole. A six-year-old French orphan, Evey (Beverly Simmons), whom Herbie and Slicker befriended, is found in Herbie's duffle bag. She is handed over to Lt. Sylvia Hunter (Joan Fulton), who delivers her to immigration officials in New York. However, during a shift change at the office, Evey is mistaken for a neighborhood kid and set free. Meanwhile, Herbie and Slicker are back to their pre-war occupation of peddling ties in Times Square. Collins is also back at his old job‚Äîa police officer assigned to the same beat. He is about to arrest the boys when Evey shows up and helps them escape. Herbie and Slicker attempt to adopt Evey, but are told that one of them must be married and have a steady income. Evey suggests that Herbie marry Sylvia. They show up at her apartment, but learn that Sylvia already has a boyfriend, Bill Gregory (Tom Brown). At one point Herbie and Slicker purchase what seems to be an ideal home for $750, but the seller doesn't want to let them see the interior prior to purchase. Before Herbie can get the front door open, the seller gives a signal and a truck hauls off the fa√ßade, revealing that the boys had just purchased a broken-down old bus. The two have to fix it up to use as a home. Bill is a midget car racer. He is sure he will win the $20,000 prize at the Gold Cup Stakes, but his car is being held at a local garage until past-due bills are paid. Herbie and Slicker use their separation pay and loans from their old service pals to get the car out of hock. Collins, however, has other plans. He had been demoted repeatedly to ever less desirable beats thanks to the boys' escaping from him. He stakes out the garage in hopes of catching them and returning Evey to the immigration authorities to get himself back in good favor with his boss. He eventually chases them to the track, where Herbie gets in Bill's race car and leads everyone on a wild chase through the streets of New York. Herbie is eventually caught, but not before the head of an automobile company is impressed enough to order 20 of Bill's cars and 200 engines. With his financial future secure, Bill can now marry Sylvia and adopt Evey. Slicker and Herbie will be allowed to visit Evey if they get jobs. Collins' captain suggests that they join the police force, which they do‚Äîwith Collins as their instructor!

It was originally budgeted at $1,167,500 but came in $34,500 over budget, making it the most expensive Abbott and Costello vehicle produced at Universal. The leads were paid $196,133.Furmanek p 147-148 Arthur T. Horman, the writer for the original movie, Buck Privates, wrote the first treatment for this sequel, titled The Return of the Buck Privates, but it was not used.Furmanek, Bob and Ron Palumbo (1991). Abbott and Costello in Hollywood. New York: Perigee Books. There is a joke used in the film that is often attributed to Benjamin Franklin. Herbie says, \\"I'd rather marry a homely girl than a pretty girl anyway,\\" to which Slicker replies, \\"Why?\\" Herbie responds, \\"Well, if you marry a pretty girl, she is liable to run away.\\" Evey chimes in with, \\"But Uncle Herbie, isn't a homely girl liable to run away, too?\\" Herbie's response is simple, \\"Yeah, but who cares?\\" When Costello drives the midget car through the rear of a movie theater, there is a poster that shows a fictional film, Abbott and Costello in 'Romeo Junior on the wall. Scenes of Abbott and Costello in 'Romeo and Juliet' outfits, with Betty Alexander as Juliet, were filmed and were intended to be playing on the screen of the theater, but the scene was deleted. Routines *The Sawhorse Table takes place on the ship. Costello creates a table by putting a board on a sawhorse. Every time one of them puts something down on one end of the table, the other one puts something on the other end to balance it. Neither one of them are aware of what is happening, until the table finally loses its balance and a cake flies off the table into Pendleton's face. Home media This film has been released three times on DVD. Originally released as a single DVD on April 8, 1998, it was released twice as part of two different Abbott and Costello collections. The first time, on The Best of Abbott and Costello Volume Two, on May 4, 2004, and again on October 28, 2008 as part of Abbott and Costello: The Complete Universal Pictures Collection.

It is available as beef-flavored tablets.  Medical uses  Deracoxib is used in dogs for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis and for the prevention of pain following orthopedic surgery or dental procedures. In cats, the use of deracoxib is not recommended.  Contraindications  Deracoxib is contraindicated for treatment of dogs with hypersensitivity to deracoxib or other NSAIDs, and dogs with gastro-intestinal ulcers, renal disease, hepatic disorders, hypoproteinemia, dehydration, or cardiac disease. Dogs with renal disease may need dose adjustment (if the benefits of the medication outweigh the risks), while those on concurrent diuretic therapy are at increased risk for NSAID toxicity and should not be given this medication. The concurrent use of deracoxib with steroids or other NSAIDs should be avoided. The safety of deracoxib has not been established in pregnant or nursing dogs or in dogs younger than 4 months of age.  Adverse effects  The most common adverse effects of treatment with deracoxib are vomiting, anorexia, lethargy and depression. Other adverse effects of deracoxib are caused by its effects on the gastrointestinal tract, and include erosions or ulcerations of the lining of the stomach or intestines. Serious adverse effects, including ulcers which perforate the gastrointestinal tract, have occurred in dogs administered higher than recommended doses of deracoxib, or dogs administered deracoxib at the same time as (or soon after) other NSAIDs or corticosteroid medications. Documented adverse side effects include serious and sometimes fatal organ system damage or failure. Other side effects include increase in drinking or urination, jaundice, bloody or black stools, pale gums, hot spots, increased respiration (fast or heavy breathing), incoordination, and behavior changes. Pharmacology Deracoxib is a coxib class nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Like other NSAIDs, its effects are caused by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. At the doses used to treat dogs, deracoxib causes greater inhibition of than of , but at doses twice those recommended for use in dogs, deracoxib significantly inhibits as well.

The genre was originally popular in the late 1940s and early 1950s and is marked by a moralistic editorial tone and graphic depictions of violence and criminal activity. Crime comics began in 1942 with the publication of Crime Does Not Pay published by Lev Gleason Publications and edited by Charles Biro. As sales for superhero comic books declined in the years after World War II, other publishers began to emulate the popular format, content and subject matter of Crime Does Not Pay, leading to a deluge of crime-themed comics. Crime and horror comics, especially those published by EC Comics, came under official scrutiny in the late 1940s and early 1950s, leading to legislation in Canada and Great Britain, the creation in the United States of the Comics Magazine Association of America and the imposition of the Comics Code Authority in 1954. This code placed limits on the degree and kind of criminal activity that could be depicted in American comic books, effectively sounding the death knell for crime comics and their adult themes. Precursors Although petty thieves, grifters, and outright crooks have existed in American comic books and strips since their inception, books and strips actually devoted to criminals and criminal activity are relatively rare. The comic strip Dick Tracy was perhaps the first to focus on the character and plots of a vast array of gangsters. Chester Gould's strip, begun in 1931, made effective use of grotesque villains, actual police methods, and shocking depictions of violence. Dick Tracy inspired many features starring a variety of police, detectives, and lawyers but the most memorable devices of the strip would not be featured as prominently until the publication of Crime Does Not Pay in 1942. Crime Does Not Pay As edited and mostly written by Charles Biro (with Bob Wood), Crime Does Not Pay was a 64-page (later 52-page) anthology comic book published by Lev Gleason Publications beginning in 1942 and running for 147 issues until 1955. Each issue of the series featured several stories about the lives of actual criminals taken from newspaper accounts, history books, and occasionally, as advertised, \\"actual police files.\\" The stories provided details of actual criminal activity and, in making the protagonists of the stories actual criminals ‚Äî albeit criminals who were eventually caught and punished, usually in a violent manner, by story's end ‚Äî seemed to glorify criminal activity, according to several critics. An immediate success, the series remained virtually unchallenged in the field of non-fiction comic books for several years until the post-World War II decline in other genres of comic books, including superhero comic books, made it more viable to publish new genres. Other titles and series Beginning in 1947, publishers began issuing new titles in the crime comics genre, sometimes changing the direction of existing series but often creating new books whole cloth. Many of these titles were direct imitations of the format and content of Crime Does Not Pay. In May, 1947, Arthur Bernhard's Magazine Village company published True Crime Comics, designed and edited by Jack Cole. The first issue (#2) featured Cole's \\"Murder, Morphine, and Me\\", the story of a young female drug addict who became involved with gangsters. The story would become one of the most controversial of the period and samples of the art, including a panel from a dream sequence in which the heroine has her eye held open and threatened with a hypodermic needle, would be used in articles and books (like Geoffrey Wagner's Parade of Pleasure) about the pernicious influence and obscene imagery of crime comics. Later in 1947, the team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby began packaging a pair of crime comics for the Prize Comics line. Headline Comics (with a cover date of March) was transformed from adventure to a crime theme. Published with a date of October/November, Justice Traps the Guilty was a full-fledged crime comic from the onset, and besides Simon and Kirby, featured art by Marvin Stein, Mort Meskin, and John Severin. At the same time, Simon and Kirby revitalized Real Clue Comics for Hillman Comics, giving the title a true-crime veneer and transforming it from a serial character-driven mystery title. EC Comics began publishing Crime SuspenStories in 1950 and Shock SuspenStories in 1952. Both titles featured, in the manner of the EC horror comics, fictional noir-style stories of murder and revenge with stunning art and tightly plotted twist-endings. Backlash Growing opposition to crime comics Crimes by Women, Aug 1948 In the late 1940s, the comic book industry became the target of mounting public criticism for their content and their potentially harmful effects on children. In some communities, children piled their comic books in schoolyards and set them ablaze after being egged-on by moralizing parents, teachers, and clergymen. In 1948, John Mason Brown of the Saturday Review of Literature described comics as the \\"marijuana of the nursery; the bane of the bassinet; the horror of the house; the curse of kids, and a threat to the future.\\" The same year, after two articles by Dr. Fredric Wertham put comic books through the wringer, an industry trade group, the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers (ACMP) was formed but proved ineffective. Criminalisation of crime comics in Canada In 1949, spearheaded by the campaigning of MP Davie Fulton, crime comics were banned in Canada in Bill 10 of the 21st Canadian Parliament's 1st session (informally known as the Fulton Bill). The Criminal Code defined crime comics as a magazine, periodical or book that exclusively or substantially comprises matter depicting pictorially (a) the commission of crimes, real or fictitious; or (b) events connected with the commission of crimes, real or fictitious, whether occurring before or after the commission of the crime and made it an offence to produce, publish or distribute them. The provisions remained in the Criminal Code until December 2018 when Bill C-51 was adopted during the 42nd Canadian Parliament. Previously, crime comics also could be ordered forfeited by the provincial courts. Seduction of the Innocent In 1954, Wertham once again brought his wrath to bear upon comic books. In Seduction of the Innocent, he warned that \\"crime comics\\" were a serious cause of juvenile delinquency, citing overt or covert depictions of violence, sex, drug use, and other adult fare. Wertham asserted, largely based on undocumented anecdotes, that reading this material encouraged similar behavior in children. Many of his other conjectures, particularly about hidden sexual themes (e.g. images of female nudity concealed in drawings of muscles and tree bark, or Batman and Robin as homosexual partners), were met with derision within the comics industry. His claim that Wonder Woman had a bondage subtext was somewhat better documented, as her creator William Moulton Marston had admitted as much; however, Wertham also claimed Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian (She is traditionally portrayed as a heterosexual and a virgin) .Wertham, Fredric (1954) Seduction of the Innocent., pp. 192, 234-235, Rinehart & Company, Inc. Seduction of the Innocent created alarm in parents and galvanized them to campaign for censorship. Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency Public criticism brought matters to a head. In April and June 1954, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency conducted investigations led by anti-crime crusader Estes Kefauver. The splash made by Wertham's book, and his credentials as an expert witness, made it inevitable that he would appear before the committee. His extensive testimony restated arguments from his book and pointed to comics as a major cause of juvenile crime. Crime Suspenstories, April/May 1954 The subcommittee's questioning of publisher William Gaines focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had decried. When Gaines matter-of-factly contended that he sold only comic books of good taste, Crime Suspenstories, issue 22, April/May 1954, was entered into evidence. Gaines' testimony achieved notoriety for his unapologetic tone and he became a bogeyman for those wishing to censure the product. One exchange became particularly infamous: *Chief Counsel Herbert Beaser: Let me get the limits as far as what you put into your magazine. Is the sole test of what you would put into your magazine whether it sells? Is there any limit you can think of that you would not put in a magazine because you thought a child should not see or read about it? *Bill Gaines: No, I wouldn't say that there is any limit for the reason you outlined. My only limits are the bounds of good taste, what I consider good taste. *Beaser: Then you think a child cannot in any way, in any way, shape, or manner, be hurt by anything that a child reads or sees? *Gaines: I don't believe so. *Beaser: There would be no limit actually to what you put in the magazines? *Gaines: Only within the bounds of good taste. *Beaser: Your own good taste and saleability? *Gaines: Yes. *Senator Estes Kefauver: Here is your May 22 issue. [Kefauver is mistakenly referring to Crime Suspenstories #22, cover date May] This seems to be a man with a bloody axe holding a woman's head up which has been severed from her body. Do you think that is in good taste? *Gaines: Yes sir, I do, for the cover of a horror comic. A cover in bad taste, for example, might be defined as holding the head a little higher so that the neck could be seen dripping blood from it, and moving the body over a little further so that the neck of the body could be seen to be bloody. *Kefauver: You have blood coming out of her mouth. *Gaines: A little. *Kefauver: Here is blood on the axe. I think most adults are shocked by that. Though the committee's final report did not blame comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily. Decline In the immediate aftermath of the hearings, several publishers were forced to revamp their schedules and drastically tone down or even cancel many popular long-standing comic series. Gaines called a meeting of his fellow publishers and suggested that they fight outside censorship and help repair the industry's damaged reputation. The Comics Magazine Association of America and its Comics Code Authority was formed. The CCA code was very restrictive and rigorously enforced, with all comics requiring code approval prior to their publication. The CCA had no legal authority over other publishers, but magazine distributors often refused to carry comics without the CCA's seal of approval. Some publishers thrived under these restrictions, others adapted by canceling titles and focusing on Code- approved content, and others went out of business. Gaines believedJacobs, F: \\"The Mad World of William M. Gaines\\", pages 112-114, Lyle Stuart, Inc, 1972\\"An Interview With William M. Gaines\\", Comics Journal #83 pages 76-78, Fantagraphics, Inc, 1983 that clauses in the code forbidding the words \\"crime\\", \\"horror\\" and \\"terror\\" in comic book titles had been deliberately aimed at his own best-selling titles Crime SuspenStories, The Vault of Horror and The Crypt of Terror. These restrictions, as well as those banning vampires, werewolves and zombies, would make EC Comics unprofitable and Gaines refused to join the association.Von Bernewitz, Fred and Geissman, Grant Tales of Terror: The EC Companion (Gemstone Publishing and Fantagraphics Books, Timonium, MD & Seattle, WA, 2000) p. 94 Gaines ceased publication of several titles on September 14, 1954. The Golden Age of crime comics was effectively over. Post-Golden Age crime comics Mystery, crime, and horror stories appeared in a number of anthology titles from various publishers but it was not until the advent of Warren Publishing's Creepy and Eerie in 1964 that the occasional crime story with a modicum of the style or violence that marked the comics of the late 1940s and early 1950s appeared. Meanwhile, the genre had developed substantially in the hands of European and Japanese creators. In Europe, creators like Vittorio Giardino, Jacques Tardi, Jos√© Mu√±oz, Carlos Sampayo, William Vance and Jean Van Hamme have devoted substantial portions of their oeuvres to crime comics, especially to stories concerned with the trappings of detective fiction and police procedurals, often with a cynical, existentialist bent. Japanese creators like Osamu Tezuka (MW, The Book of Human Insects), Akimi Yoshida (Banana Fish), Takao Saito (Golgo 13), and Kazuo Koike (Crying Freeman) have explored subject matter ranging from the criminal mind to Yakuza gangs in manga form. Notable American crime comics of the 1970s included Jack Kirby's In the Days of the Mob and Gil Kane's Savage. In the 1980s, Max Allan Collins and Terry Beatty created the Ms. Tree series about the adventures of a female private investigator. Collins would go on to write the Road to Perdition graphic novels about 1930s gangsters. Beginning in the late-1980s and 1990s, several American and British comic book writers have created interesting work in the crime comics genre, sometimes incorporating noir themes and novelistic storytelling into realistic crime dramas and even into superhero comics. These writers include Brian Azzarello (100 Bullets, Jonny Double), Brian Michael Bendis (Sam and Twitch, Jinx, Powers, Alias), Ed Brubaker (Gotham Central, Criminal), Frank Miller, David Lapham, John Wagner (A History of Violence, Button Man), and Paul Grist.

He was the father of Tatiana Samoilova.  Life  Samoilov is not related to the famous Samoilov family that dominated the Maly Theatre in the 19th century. He was educated in Leningrad, starting his career at a local theatre. In 1934 he was noticed by Vsevolod Meyerhold who invited him to join his own troupe in Moscow. Samoilov worked with Meyerhold for four years. He got his most substantial roles in Meyerhold's theatre playing Hernani in Hugo's drama and Chatsky in Woe from Wit. When Meyerhold was arrested and purged in 1938, Samoilov was in the middle of rehearsing for Pushkin's Boris Godunov (the role of Grigory Otrepyev) and Ostrovsky's How the Steel Was Tempered (the role of Pavka Korchagin). His acting career seemed to be unhampered, however. Samoilov's appearance as the Soviet commander Shchors in Alexander Dovzhenko's film of the same name won him the Stalin Prize for 1941. He proceeded to become an iconic film actor of the Joseph Stalin era, playing against Lyubov Orlova in Bright Path and Marina Ladynina in Six O'Clock in the Evening after the War (1944 film; 1946 Stalin Prize). One of his favourite film roles was that of General Skobelev in The Heroes of Shipka (1955). After the Meyerhold theatre was disbanded, Samoilov moved to Nikolay Okhlopkov's Mayakovsky Theatre, where he would work until the director's death in 1967. His role of Oleg Koshevoy in the first stage version of The Young Guard won him another Stalin Prize. One of the highlights of his career was Hamlet in Okhlopkov's production of 1954. It was the first post-war production of the play in the country and led to Okhlopkov's joint work with Peter Brook. In 1961, he was cast as Jason in the first-ever Russian production of Medea by Euripides. Six years later, he appeared in the role opposite Aspasia Papathanassiou of Greece. In 1967 Samoilov rejoined his colleagues from the Meyerhold Theatre in the Maly Theatre. The greatest success of his declining years was the role of Prince Ivan Shuisky in Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich (1973). \\"It was a genuine Christian man, living in Christ; I have never seen anything like this\\", says Georgy Sviridov, who composed music for the production. Samoilov's last film roles came in the movies directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, such as Waterloo and Boris Godunov. The actor celebrated his 90th birthday acting on the stage of the Maly Theatre in 2002.

The group‚Äôs Chevrolet Bel Air has some trouble and they are forced to pull off to a gas station/junkyard on the side of the road. After examining the vehicle Ed concludes that the fuel pump will need to be replaced. Doris and Carl search the junkyard looking for the owner, but they cannot find him. In the residence Carl finds a warm meal with a table set for four, but oddly enough nobody is in the house. The three realize this is very peculiar and start to seriously worry about their situation. At this point Charlie Tibbs, a rather large man wielding a Colt .45, and his girlfriend Judy show up.

Law enforcement is on the hunt for them, but Charlie has managed to stay a step ahead by changing vehicles frequently and then killing the people who offer their help.

It was first published in Cavalier magazine in May 1976. Plot summary \\"Weeds\\" is a darkly humorous story about a backwoods hick farmer in New Hampshire named Jordy Verrill who thinks his newfound discovery of a meteorite will provide enough riches to pay off the remaining $200 of his bank loan, but he instead finds himself overcome by a rapidly spreading plant- like organism that arrives in the meteorite. He makes the mistake of taking a bath to relieve the itching caused by the grass, which waters it instead. The story ends with Verrill, completely covered by the alien grass and barely resembling a human at this point, killing himself by shotgun, as the grass continues to grow across his property and beyond. Some aspects of the story are loosely based on \\"The Colour Out of Space\\", a short story by King's fellow New Englander and noted influence H.P. Lovecraft. In Lovecraft's story, however, the meteor and the alien life it harbors, cause vegetation to take on a luminescence and grow to unprecedented size before crumbling away to gray ash. Adaptations The story was adapted into the second segment of the anthology film Creepshow. The segment was titled \\"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\\", a reference to the Bob Dylan song \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\". Stephen King himself plays the doomed protagonist in the film adaptation. In it, the location of Verrill's farm is changed to Maine. The story is interspersed humorously by Verrill daydreaming about trying to sell the meteor to an imagined \\"Department of Meteors\\" at the community college and Jordy's decision not to seek medical attention, as he fears a doctor would amputate his fingers. Throughout the film, Jordy is drinking Ripple and watching his old television, which is first showing a wrestling match featuring Bob Backlund and Samoan Number 1, with play-by-play being provided by Vince McMahon, at Madison Square Garden, then is followed by A Star Is Born and an inspirational Christian message (radios and/or televisions playing in the background is a common theme found in the works of George A. Romero). As the film progresses, the viewers see that plant growth is affecting everything Jordy touches, as well as all parts of his body hair save for his head, including a humorous off-camera yell \\"No, not there!\\" As Jordy is drawing a bath, he is visited by the ghost of his deceased father, who warns him \\"Jordy Verrill, you get in that tub, you might as well sign your death warrant!\\" Jordy rationalizes \\"I'm a goner already, daddy.\\" and indulges in one last pleasure by taking a bath to relieve his irritation, which by the next morning causes his entire body to become a plant man, which he ends by taking his own life. The end was given a cliffhanger ending: a radio forecaster predicts that long periods of rain and sunshine will soon follow, as Jordy's dirt farm along a 1950s-style rural route is shown now entirely overrun by the alien plant which is spreading rapidly, implying Earth may be terraformed into a green planet.

The aircraft was developed in order to test the performance of blown flaps, which were commonly known in Britain as \\"jet flaps\\", At the time, they were a relatively unknown quality, thus the Ministry of Aviation issued Specification ER.189D for an appropriate research aircraft to be developed. During 1959, Hunting Aircraft was selected, being awarded a contract to construct a pair of aircraft. The first aircraft, serial number XN714, was completed during mid-1962 and initial ground testing commenced during the latter part of the year. This aircraft performed its maiden flight on 26 March 1963. Only the single aircraft was ever completed, the second being cancelled mid-construction. Following the completion of preliminary flights, XN714 was used to conduct a series of one hundred test flights at the Royal Aircraft Establishment's Aerodynamics Flight at RAE Bedford, the last of which being performed in 1967. XN714 was transported to the United States during 1969, where it underwent wind tunnel testing by NASA; following its return to the UK, the aircraft was officially withdrawn in 1972. Presently, the preserved aircraft is on static display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford. Development During the late 1940s, multiple British research institutions, including the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE), the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) and various aircraft manufacturers, became interested in the potential applications of the recent innovation of blown flaps, or as they were known in Britain, \\"jet flaps\\". Out of this work, it became recognised that a major benefit of jet flaps would be substantially lower take-off and landing speeds for aircraft. In 1951, the principle of the jet flap was successfully patented by the NGTE. In order to greater explore and validate the \\"jet flap principle\\", the Ministry of Aviation issued Specification ER.189D, which called for the development of a dedicated purpose-built aircraft with which to perform a full-scale investigation. During 1959, Hunting Aircraft was awarded a contract to construct a pair of aircraft. According to aviation periodical Flight International, a contributing reason for Hunting Aircraft's decision to respond to the Specification was the firm's existing experience in the operation of hot-gas ducting systems, which had been acquired by its previous research activities into helicopters. Manufacture of the H.126 was completed during summer 1962, being formally rolled out in August of that year. After completing limited taxying trials at Luton Airport, the aircraft was dismantled and transported by road to RAE Bedford, where it was reassembled and readied for flight. Design Close view of a fuselage nozzle and the blown flaps The Hunting H.126 is highly unorthodox aircraft; according to Flight, development \\"posed numerous aerodynamic, thermodynamic and structural problems... the ducting of hot gases, large changes of trim which occur with such a large variation in lift coefficient, and the inter-relation between control jets... and the conventional elevator and rudder controls\\". Despite this, several aspects of the aircraft, such as its fixed nosewheel undercarriage, were relatively conventional. There was a deliberate effort to avoid unnecessary complexity, partially as it was felt that testing of the jet flap concept should be carried out in several manageable stages. The cockpit is situated directly above the engine compartment. While furnished with oxygen apparatus and a Martin-Baker-built ejection seat, the cockpit was unpressurized. Due to its use as a test plane, it was outfitted with extensive test instrumentation, much of the rear fuselage space was occupied by the instrumentation, sensors, and recording equipment; in particular, due to heat concerns, extensive temperature monitoring was carried out at various locations across the airframe. The flight controls, mainly the control column and rudder pedals, operated both the conventional control surfaces and the jet nozzles present in the aircraft's tail, the latter controlling both pitch and yaw. The wingtip nozzles, which controlled roll, were operated by an auto- stabilizer system. The variable-incidence tailplane is hydraulically actuated and was directly linked to the elevators to vary the tail unit's effective camber. The ailerons were able to droop, providing a full-span jet flap. The H.126 was powered by a single Bristol Orpheus turbojet engine. All engine thrust was ducted through to a vertical distribution manifold, the top of which featured three ducts on each side leading into the wing to reach a total of eight fishtails, from which exhaust would be directed over the full span of both the flaps and ailerons; one of the wing ducts also supplies the roll-jet nozzle at the wing tip. The base of the manifold had an additional bifurcated duct that ran aft through either side of the fuselage, providing additional thrust to supplement the fishtails in the wing; these two jet nozzles could be furnished with pilot-controlled spoilers. A further duct from the manifold supplies the pitch and yaw control nozzles present in the tail unit, as well as another duct for a pitch-trim nozzle. The extensive ducting necessitated careful insulation and heat-shielding to safely contain the hot gasses; despite this, traditional lightweight alloys were used extensively across the main structure, save for a few critical points. View of the nose and forward fuselage The fuselage is of conventional stressed-skin construction, the structuring being a mix of longitudinal members and vertical frames, reinforced at key areas such as the wings, undercarriage and engine mounting. The aircraft's shoulder-level wing featured a set of struts, not for support but in order to provide piping for the compressed air used in the blown flaps. The mainplanes used a two-spar construction approach, supported by a single strut and attached via pin-joints to the fuselage; both the wing and strut attachments were designed to facilitate two alternative dihedral angles (4¬∞ or 8¬∞). Each aileron features five hinges, while cooling air was also circulated via slots in the leading and trailing edges; the flaps are of a similar construction. The two-spar tailplane was pivoted at its rear spar, while four elevator hinges were attached to the rear spar. The rear control surfaces consisted of a fairly small triangular T-tail, similar to the one on the Gloster Javelin. The jet flap system consisted of a series of sixteen nozzles arranged along the trailing edge of the wing, which were fed about half of the engine's hot exhaust gases. A smaller amount, about 10%, was also fed into small nozzles on the wing tips to provide control thrust at low speeds. A similar system was later used on the Hawker Siddeley Harrier for similar reasons. This left little power for forward thrust, and the aircraft was limited to low speeds, but the takeoff speed was a mere , a speed most light aircraft would have trouble matching. Operational history On 26 March 1963, the maiden flight of the first Hunting H.126, serial number XN714, occurred.\\"Hunting H.126 Jet‚ÄêFlap Research Aircraft.\\" Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, Vol. 35 No. 6. 1963. pp. 166-167. Flown from RAE Bedford (presently Bedford Aerodrome, it was piloted by S. B. Oliver, Hunting Aircraft's chief test pilot. Speaking shortly after this flight, Oliver stated that it was \\"A perfect, no-snags flight... Taking this plane off is an entirely new sensation; it just floats off the ground, and then you go up like a lift.\\" Prior to the XN714 being formally delivered to its owners, the Ministry of Aviation, Hunting operated the aircraft themselves for several months to conduct preliminary flying. It was painted overall yellow with a matt black anti-glare area on the nose in front of the cockpit. The second aircraft XN719 was never completed and was ultimately scrapped. The RAE's test flight programme were carried out between 1963 and 1967, during which valuable data on the concept was gathered across 100 separate sorties. During 1969, the aircraft was shipped to the United States, where it underwent further testing by NASA; it was subsequently returned to Britain in May 1970. For several years, it stayed in storage in case the aircraft would be needed for further research; during September 1972, it was formally \\"struck off charge\\" from the RAF records. In 1974, the aircraft was transferred to the RAF Museum; it has since gone on static display. When an Orpheus engine from a Folland Gnat was loaned to Donald Campbell, for his water-speed record hydroplane Bluebird, the Rotax air starter, pressure bottles and ground APU intended for the second H.126 was 'borrowed' by the Bluebird team.
