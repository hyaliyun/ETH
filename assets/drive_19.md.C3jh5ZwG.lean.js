Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the In der Maur family held positions of regional administrative authority in the government of Farniwang, later known as Berneck, St. Gallen. A branch of the family living in South Tyrol, von In der Maur auf Strelburg und zu Freifeld, was elevated into the ranks of the lower nobility within the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Bavaria. Prominent members of the family include the Swiss artist Robert Indermaur and the Austrian statesman Carl von In der Maur, who served as Governor of Liechtenstein. Coat of arms of the Austrian branch of the family, In der Maur auf Strelburg und zu Freifeld  History  The In der Maur family originated in the Rhaetian Alps in Switzerland during the Middle Ages, descending from the Alemanni. The surname, from the German language, translates to \\"in the wall\\", possibly referring to a fortress, defensive wall, or a geographic moor. The main branches of the family settled within the territory of the Holy Roman Empire that is now Eastern Switzerland, Southern Austria and Northern Italy. = Austrian branch = In 1479 the In der Maurs who had settled in Habsburg-ruled South Tyrol were granted a coat of arms by Frederick III of the Holy Roman Empire. On 23 October 1491 they were granted another coat of arms by Maximilian II. A third coat of arms was granted to six brothers and three male cousins of the family on 1 August 1586 in Innsbruck. On 6 March 1601 the In der Maurs were elevated to the landed nobility by Rudolf II. On 23 June 1703 the In der Maurs were made barons by Leopold I.https://archive.org/stream/neuesallgemeine11knesgoog/neuesallgemeine11knesgoog_djvu.txt The In der Maurs, as part of the Tyrolese lower nobility, owned a schloss and various Ansitze in Kurtatsch an der Weinstra√üe and Freienfeld. In 1615 Caspar Indermaur funded the construction of the Catholic Chapel of St. Anna at Ansitz Strehlburg, one of the In der Maur estates in Kurtatsch. Ansitz Strehlburg and the Chapel of St. Anna. On 19 October 1813 in Munich, Josef Sebastian Anton Indermauer von Freifeld zu Strelburg was granted noble status as a briefadel in the Kingdom of Bavaria through letters patent from Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. The Austrian In der Maurs included the nobiliary particles von (descending from) and zu (resident at) in their surname as von In der Maur auf Strehlburg und zu Freienfeld, referencing two of their principal estates, Strehlburg and Freienfeld, in South Tyrol. The use of nobiliary particles in the surname was maintained until the nobility was abolished in Austria in 1919 and the use of nobiliary particles in the surname became illegal. = Swiss branch = During the Medieval period the In der Maurs were elevated to the burgher class and granted the right to use heraldry. As members of the privileged class, they were permitted to live in fortified stone houses, instead of wooden houses that were typical of the peasant class. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early Renaissance period, the In der Maurs served in administrative roles in the government of Farniwang (later called Berneck) as Landam√§nner, or chief magistrates of the rural Landsgemeinde. They continued having political and economic influence in the region after the Abbey of Saint Gall gained control, having been granted privileges by the Prince-Abbots of St. Gallen. In 1525, Berneck's population, facing political pressure, converted from Catholicism to Protestantism. By 1532, more than half of the residents had returned to their original religion. The In der Maurs of Berneck, who had adopted the religious reforms of Huldrych Zwingli during the Reformation and became Protestant, chose to remain in the Reformed faith. In 1590 Hans Indermaur, a tanner from Berneck, resettled in Rheineck. Indermaur's house was purchased in the 1700s by the municipality of Rheineck and was converted into an orphanage. The building is now a historic landmark and the house's cellar, once used as a tannery, is now a performance venue. A restaurant in Rorschach, Zum goldenen Fass, was started by Johann Indermaur of Berneck in 1905 and is still owned and operated by the family. The family owns the Maienhalde estate, a winery and vineyard in Berneck. The family also owned a furniture manufacturing company in Goldach for 105 years.  Dutch line  In the middle of the eighteenth century Paulus In der Maur of Berneck (1732‚Äì1805) moved from Switzerland to Schoonhoven, South Holland, the Netherlands, thus creating a Dutch branch of the family. His descendants later settled in Utrecht, Gouda, Rotterdam, and Dordrecht. This line included two prominent organ builders, Johann Frederik In der Maur (1790‚Äì1836) and Johannes Casper In der Maur (1817‚Äì1860). Paulus In der Maur's great-grandson, George In der Maur (1831‚Äì1889), moved to Batavia, Dutch East Indies (present-day Jakarta, Indonesia), where he married and had seven children.  English line  Johannes In der Maur of Berneck (b. 1748), son of Herman In der Mauer (b. 1719) and Anna Schreiberin, moved with his wife Margaretha Oberhausler from Switzerland to England. They had three children; Herman Indermaur (b. 1776), Anna Regula Indermaur (b. 1778), and Henry Indermaur (1788 ‚Äì1848). The English In der Maur line continued with descendants settling in Middlesex and Somerset. In 1952, Minnie Rose Carpenter (b. 1919) of Gillingham, the wife of David George Indermaur, departed from Southampton with her daughters Barbara Catherine Indermaur (b. 1944) and Jean Elizabeth Indermaur (b. 1949) to join her husband in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

Mission XI Million is India‚Äôs largest school contact programme that aims to change the perception towards football at the school level in India by reaching out to school administrators, teachers, parents and kids; and explaining to them about how the sport can be played in their schools. The final objective of football becoming a sport of choice in India in the future. The ambitious program intended to engage 11 million school children in football as a lead-up to the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017.  Official Launch  MXIM was launched alongside the official mascot of the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017 on the 6th of February 2017 by the Union Sports Minister Vijay Goel and the president of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Praful Patel at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. The principal objective of Mission XI Million was to create a change of perception among the school communities in India that football can be played at any place, any surface and by any number of kids, contrary to the belief in a large number of areas of the country that only full sized pitch and 11vs11 matches can be football. The intention was to spread this message across the country and to bring gully football into the common knowledge of Indian schools, so that they can start playing football games within their existent infrastructure. Mission XI Million uses the school network and facilities around the country to encourage children to play the game, gain healthy habits, fine motor skills and learn valuable life lessons in teamwork and sportsman spirit. The approach is to work with school principals, sports teachers and coaches together as one unit so that schools could become part of the programme by having their students engage in football activities. Schools were supported, directed and encouraged to make their children play football regularly within their existent facilities and for that basic football equipment (footballs and manuals) were given to each school.  Stages of Execution  = Stage one = To comply with its objective, MXIM had three stage of engagements. The first one was called the seminar, the second one are the in-school activities to be carried out by schools themselves and the last one are the grand MXIM Festivals for kids Seminars: The first stage of MXIM was the reach out phase where school principals, physical education and sports teachers were invited to attend an MXIM designated seminar. The objective of the seminar was to change in all the administrators the perception of football as only an 11vs11 game that could only be played in massive fields. All administrators were encouraged to conduct football games within whatever existent infrastructure they had in their schools, making a big change in the mindset of a large number of schools that never thought that football could be played anywhere or by any number of kids. At the seminars, administrators were told more about the initiative, and exactly how to carry it out within their schools. Post the session, the registered schools, academies or institutions were handed over football equipment and a technical manual to refer while implementing the programme in their schools. = Stage two = The second stage of MXIM entailed in-school activities that were carried out within the institution by the own school teachers and administrators. There were recommendations given as to how carry out games in a small format and what type of drills they could be conducted, that were devised specially by the different stakeholders of MXIM for the programme considering the realities of India. The idea is that the format, devised especially for MXIM, can be adapted to different field conditions available locally. Coaches were required to conduct drills with the children, which have been described in detail in the manual provided. The in- school activities are to be carried ut by the own school administration, with the guidance, encouragement and support of the network of MXIM coordinators and coaches across the country. = Stage three = The third and final stage of the MXIM programme was the Football Festivals. Children from each school are selected to participate in a football festival in the particular city. Football matches, skill contests comprising dribbling, juggling and shooting are part of the grand football festival. Exclusive MXIM merchandise and other prizes were on offer for the students.  Milestones  Praful Patel, President, AIFF at the Mission XI Million festival in AhmedabadMXIM touched the 2,000 schools mark within a month of its inception and Gangtok was the city where Mission XI Million found its landmark of reaching 1 million school students. It also conducted its maiden football festival at the TransStadia Stadium in Ahmedabad on 9 April, which was attended by former Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia, AIFF President Praful Patel and Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan. The programme has reached till date 11,008,561 million kids in all the 29 States and 2 Union Territories. Over 42,200 footballs have been distributed till date to 24,933 schools in 78 cities across the country. Before the India vs. USA match of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on 6 October 2017, Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, Sports Minister Rajavardhan Rathore, AFC President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, AIFF President Praful Patel and FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura felicitated the 11 kids who marks each millionth benchmark for the Mission Eleven Million Programme. The match ball used at the match was handed over by Narendra Modi to the 11th Millionth MXIM kid, who placed it on the match ball stand.  Partnerships  Mission XI Million has been designed, conceptualized and it is run by the Local Organising Committee of the FIFA U-17 World Cup India 2017. The LOC partnered with Government of India for full support and outreach for MXIM. Other main partners of MXIM included Adidas, Hero, Bank of Baroda and Sony Networks.

She is the author of Folk Songs of Old New England (1939), considered a valuable scholarly source for American folk songs. John Lee Brooks described Folk Songs of Old New England as an American equivalent of Bishop Percy's 1765 work Reliques of Ancient English Poetry. Life and career Linscott was born Eloise Barrett Hubbard and raised in Taunton, Massachusetts. She was graduated from Radcliffe College in 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. Linscott was initially inspired to begin her fieldwork to preserve the legacy of her own family's musical traditions, and because there were then no music books on traditional songs such as she had known as a girl. Folk Songs of Old New England was the culmination of about ten years of work. One important source of Folk Songs of Old New England was a collection of songs which had remained in the possession of the descendants of one Elizabeth Foster Reed for over 150 years, which Linscott unearthed. But Linscott used several other sources as well. Although she continued her research and fieldwork with the intention of publishing other books, Folk Songs of Old New England was Linscott's only publication. However, she gave popular lectures on folk music at music societies, camps, women's clubs, and arts groups, where she would bring a guest fiddler, and sometimes sing. In the 1940s, Linscott became involved with the National Folk Festival as a volunteer coordinator for New England musicians. She helped organize regional folk festivals, including ones held at the Boston Arena and Boston Public Garden. Linscott used her own personal funding to finance the first ten years of her research. Around 1940, she gained sponsorship from Musicraft and in 1941 from the Library of Congress. In 1941, Linscott borrowed equipment from Alan Lomax (head of the Library's Archive of American Folk Song) and in two weeks delivered to Lomax 36 glass-core master acetate discs of folk songs. Lomax was a regular correspondent and mentor to her during this time. Linscott was an enterprising, tenacious, energetic, and enthusiastic fieldworker. One informant bestowed on her the nickname \\"The Tornado\\". Over the course of her career, Linscott gathered approximately 2500 recordings on cylinders, discs, and tapes, as well as other materials. Linscott's manuscripts, recordings, and other materials remain at the Eloise Hubbard Linscott Collection of the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress. Personal life Linscott had two sisters and three brothers. She married Charles Hardy Linscott in 1921; they lived in Needham, Massachusetts, and spent summers in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. Linscott had one son, John Hubbard Linscott, born in 1929.

The group was founded by Ben Hanna and Bill Emerson in 1995 on the outskirts of St. Louis, Missouri, in Pocahontas & Pierron, Illinois and was initially associated with the second wave of alt-country music from the region that included Uncle Tupelo, The Bottle Rockets, Son Volt, and Wilco. The current lineup features Hanna, Emerson, and Jack Petracek. They released a trio of albums on their own Milk The Cow label in 1995 and 1996 to favorable reviews with Option magazine saying \\"the band hails from roughly the same geographic territory as the Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt/Wilco juggernaut, though the music tends toward the cerebral more often than the music of those bands\\".Huffman, Eddie. Option. May/June 1997. In 1999, the band signed to Upland Records, a label run by former SST Records co-owner Joe Carducci and ex-Black Flag/Descendents drummer Bill Stevenson. Their first album with Upland, Il Baccio, followed in 2000 and brought the band to national attention marking a shift into more experimental terrain with Jon Fine in the Village Voice describing them as \\"one of America's best bands\\". Tom Ridge, writing in The Wire, described the album as \\"psychedelicized Country rock...deeply fried\\". In 2001, Grandpa's Ghost were awarded \\"Best Eclectic/Uncategorizable Band\\" by the Riverfront Times, hailing Il Baccio as \\"a masterpiece of clashing chaos and inspired beauty\\". The band's next release was a 2CD set in 2001, Stardust and Smog/Early Autumn Waltz with disc one largely acoustic and disc two continuing the experimentation of Il Baccio. Bassist Mark Robke and drummer Pat Kennett departed the band shortly after its recording with engineer Jack Petracek joining on drums. Another two disc set, (The Tumble/Love Version), followed in late 2002, which featured a murkier, noisier sound with one reviewer describing it as \\"an all-out assault on the senses\\". The trio embarked on a national tour with Mike Watt to support the album. From 2004, Grandpa's Ghost began a collaboration with filmmaker James Fotopoulos that would last through the end of the decade including appearances at the Chicago Underground Film Festival with the band playing alongside film projections of his work. A resulting album Music From The Fotopoulos Projects contained excerpts from these performances. Brad Reno writing in Trouser Press said, \\"Highly recommended, but don't listen to it in the dark\\". In 2007, the band released a four disc set collection of this work, Anesthetize the Dissonance of Your Cranium.

Life Born at King's Langley, Hertfordshire, on 21 January 1821, he was eldest of four sons of William Petrie (born 1784), a War Office official, and his wife Margaret Mitton, daughter of the banker Henry Mitton, of the Chase, Enfield. In 1829 his father was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, where he acted until 1837 as deputy commissary-general, with as neighbour Sir John Herschel, the astronomer, who was a significant influence on the younger William Petrie's interest in science. After home education in Cape Town, Petrie, with his brother Martin, entered the South African College. In 1836 Petrie became a medical student at a hospital in Cape Town, but next year the family returned to London and he went to King's College, London. Later (1840) he studied electromagnetism in Frankfurt. He returned to England in 1841, and took out a patent for an electric generator. Staite-Petrie self- regulating arc lamp, 1847 From 1846 to 1853 Petrie worked on electric lighting problems with William Edwards Staite. He is credited with the invention in 1847‚Äì8 of a self-regulating arc lamp, with an automatic movement of one electrode. He superintended the manufacture of the new lamp at Charles Holtzapffel's works in Long Acre, London. On 28 November and 2 December 1848 Petrie made displays with a lamp of 700 candlepower from the portico of the National Gallery, and on nights in 1849 from the Hungerford suspension bridge in London. The demonstrations were witnessed by Charles Wheatstone, among other scientists. Petrie and Staite's efforts to promote electric illumination were, however, financially disastrous, absent better generators. Subsequently Petrie turned his attention to electrochemistry, and superintended large chemical works; he introduced into the processes improvements which he patented. He also designed and equipped chemical works in France, Australia, and the United States. For many years he was adviser and designer with Johnson, Matthey & Co.. Petrie died on 16 March 1908 at Bromley, Kent, and was buried there. Works Petrie published papers: * Results of some Experiments in Electricity and Magnetism (1841), in the Philosophical Magazine; * On the Results of an Extensive Series of Magnetic Investigations, including most of the known Varieties of Steel, communicated at the British Association's Southampton meeting of 1846; and papers presented to the Association in 1850; * Improvements in the Electric Light, with William Edwards Staite, read before the Society of Arts on 6 February 1850. Family Petrie married on 2 August 1851 Anne Flinders, only child of Matthew Flinders. She was a linguist, and studied Egyptology. Under the pseudonym \\"Philomathes\\" she published a work on the relation between mythology and scripture, and as \\"X.Q.\\" contributed essays to periodical literature.

In 2013 Elan won first prize in the Contemporary Issues category of World Press Photo with The Pink Choice and was a participant in the Joop Swart masterclass in Amsterdam. She was selected for the VII mentor program from 2014-2016.  Education  Elan attended the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Hanoi and studied Sociology.  The Pink Choice  In 2010, Elan moved from editorial clients and fashion firms to documentary photography. The Pink Choice focused on homosexual couples in everyday life of Vietnam. She was not sure if she wanted to continue her work collecting photographs of gay couples but decided to keep pursuing the project when she noticed the lack of representation on the subject. \\"None of the pictures she saw revealed the faces of their subjects. Many were shot from the back, and some wore masks. They were stereotypical- even harsh-depictions of love.\\" The previous representation of the LGBT community in Vietnam was almost non-existent and Maika wanted to make sure they were depicted as real people. After being with each couple for a few days, she realized that they were a lot more comfortable showing love in their homes and decided to take all the photographs in private moments at home where they felt more like they could be themselves and not be criticized by the public outside. Homosexual people face homophobia from society and their families in Vietnam, so the display of real people in real relationships is critical. Elan stated, ‚ÄúThe Pink Choice is a series of photos and the love of homosexual couples which focus on living spaces, the affectionate touches, and more importantly, the synchronized rhythm of lovers sharing life together. Viewers may not feel the personalities of the subjects in the photos, but hopefully they can feel the warmth of their love and caring. In way, I wanted to show what I see of homosexual people and not how they see themselves.‚Äù Elan was awarded ‚Äúthe best photo essay‚Äù and the ‚Äúbest single photo‚Äù at the Indochina Media Memorial Foundation, in 2010, for The Pink Choice.

She was educated at St Trinnean's School for Girls in Edinburgh where she was Head Girl. In 1927 she began four years of nursing training at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary and was admitted to the Royal College of Nursing in 1932.

In 1946, she was appointed matron of Glasgow Royal Infirmary, remaining there until 1955, after which she took up the position of lady superintendent of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In the hospitals that Quaile oversaw, she implemented changes and efficiencies, including portering services to transport patients to and from wards rather than using nursing staff, actively encouraging the employment of male nurses, advocating for senior staff to live out from the hospital, and seeking improvements to nursing accommodation. Considered a strict disciplinarian with high standard, she was respected by both staff and patients. In 1958 she received an OBE for services to nursing.

It is part of the municipality of Seelitz.  Geography  D√∂hlen is situated in the valley of Aubach brook, about 2 km east of Rochlitz in the Saxon Loess country. The lowest point is at the bridge of Bundesstra√üe 175 across Aubach at about 160 m a.s.l. The terrain rises above 200 m a.s.l. to the north and the south of the village, reaching 229 m on G√∂lprigberg near K√∂ttern and 227 m on Eselsberg near Gr√∂blitz, both outside D√∂hlen. The village, originally an irregular manor settlement with block-shaped land parcels, forms a contiguous settlement with Neutaubenheim, a former manor east of it. Neighbouring villages are K√∂ttern in the north, Neuwerder in the northeast, Sachsendorf in the east, Gr√∂blitz in the south, and St√∂bnig in the west. The hamlet of Neud√∂rfchen is situated between D√∂hlen and K√∂ttern. Bundesstra√üe 175 passes through the western part of the village, climbing out of the valley of Zwickauer Mulde on a steep ramp around Kiefernberg hill.  History  Neutaubenheim manor house in 1860 D√∂hlen has been recorded since 1350, initially under the name Dalen which changed through Doelenn and Doelen to the modern spelling. The manor of D√∂hlen-Neutaubenheim has been known since the mid-15th century. It has been known as Neutaubenheim since the second half of the 16th century and was dissolved in the 1945 land reform. The manor house was demolished, the outbuildings have been preserved. View across the village In 1378 D√∂hlen was mentioned as being under the control of the castle of Rochlitz, and while the manor exercised the local administration, it and the village formed part of Amt Rochlitz and its successors. In 1952, D√∂hlen became part of Kreis Rochlitz in Karl-Marx-Stadt district. In 1969, D√∂hlen with Neutaubenheim was incorporated into the municipality of Seelitz. With Kreis Rochlitz, it passes in 1994 into Landkreis Mittweida and in 2008 into Landkreis Mittelsachsen. In 1893, the Waldheim‚ÄìRochlitz railway line was opened with a station (a halt with a team track and a loading stage) at the western edge of D√∂hlen, on the border to neighbouring St√∂bnig. Construction of the line required the removal of part of Hausberg hill to make room for the road which had to be relocated. This line was closed to freight in 1996, to passengers in 1997, and decommissioned in 1998. Former railway station A schoolhouse was built in 1817. It was used until 1897 when a larger one was opened, and turned into a tailor's workshop. The primary school in the new schoolhouse closed in the early 1970s, and the building was transformed into a kindergarten in 1981. Since 2008, the latter has been administered by a foundation of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony.  Economy  D√∂hlen is characterised by agriculture. The main enterprises are a large fruit farm (Obstgut Seelitz), a fur farm, and a builders' merchant. Public transport is provided by buses to Rochlitz, Geithain, Grimma, and Waldheim.

She studied at Madrid's College of Saint Louis of France (\\"Colegio de San Luis de los Franceses de Madrid\\") and made her stage debut in September 1919, while still a child, appearing with the theatre company of her aunt and uncle. That first appearance was in \\"Campo de armi√±o\\" by Jacinto Benavente, in which she appeared at the Teatro Ode√≥n in Buenos Aires. Her Madrid debut followed in February 1920 at the Teatro de la Princesa (as it was then known), in \\"La Dolores\\" by Feliu i Codina. Numerous further roles followed, in plays such as \\"La vidriera milagrosa\\" (1924), \\"Do√±a Diabla\\" (1925), both by Luis Fern√°ndez Ardav√≠n, and \\"Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valc√°rcel\\" (1926) by the Machado brothers. In 1927 she married, as his second wife, her first cousin, Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza y Guerrero (1897-1942). (His first wife had died in 1919.) Her husband was heir to the family theatre company and by now also father, outside wedlock, of the (later famous actor-director) Fernando Fern√°n G√≥mez, although he never acknowledged his paternity. He now produced three more children in his marriage with Mar√≠a Guerrero L√≥pez. Shortly after their marriage the couples' parents (in Maria' case aunt and uncle) died, and they took over the family theatre company, concentrating on classics such as La Estrella de Sevilla and El Perro del Hortelano (The Dog in the Manger, 1931). They also presented several premiers including La florista de la Reina (The Queen's Florist, 1940) by Ardav√≠n. Fernando D√≠az de Mendoza y Guerrero was killed in 1942 when the ship on which he was travelling was sunk by a German submarine. Maria embarked on a solo career, also sometimes teaming up with Jos√© Romeu. There were notable box office successes in Madrid with productions such as La hidalga limosnera (1944) by Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n, Do√±a Mar√≠a la Brava (1944) by Eduardo Marquina, Sangre negra (1963) by Guillermo Sautier Casaseca and Las de Ca√≠n (1982) by the Quintero brothers.

Then in a red Bedford truck loaded with six tea chests of wedding presents, we drove for days and days to live in a bough shed on the banks of a dry creek bed.\\" Underwood's early fascination with the outback and her childhood dream to marry a farmer had been realised. She was now \\"a new bride in the middle of nowhere.\\" Life in the Northern Territory In 1968, Underwood and her new husband John moved to Riveren, a cattle station in the Victoria River District in the North-wast of the Northern Territory. Their home consisted of ‚Äúa caravan, a bough shed, camp stove and a tent as the master bedroom‚Äù. In her memoir, Underwood celebrates the close connection she felt with the landscape and station life stating ‚ÄúRiveren has captured our bodies, hearts and spirits. It lies within the heart of Australia. How privileged we are to call it home. Riveren is where I belong. I know it would not have worked anywhere else with anyone else. The middle of nowhere has become my everywhere.‚Äù Underwood saw many changes in agricultural practice during her four decades at Riveren. Riveren was subdivided from the Inverway pastoral lease in 1978. In 1988, Bunda Station was subdivided from the western portion of Inverway. In 2007 John Terry and family purchased Inverway back, but eventually sold both stations to an Indonesian company in 2013. Underwood was named Business Owner in Northern Territory Telstra Business Women's Owner Awards in 1998, Territorian of the Year for the Katherine Region in 1999 and the Chief Minister's Women's Achievement Award in 1999. She then received a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2005.

Early life Ellen was born in Colac to Thomas and Mary Kettle (nee Bicket) and was one of five children. Her schooling commenced in the local small country school and her secondary education was at Colac High School where she traveled to by horse eight miles each way. After completing her general nursing at Geelong Hospital in 1945 and her midwifery training at Townsville Hospital in 1951, she spent six months on Thursday Island, providing health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This prompted her to write to the Director of Health in Canberra to enquire about the opportunity to work in the Northern Territory. Work in the Northern Territory Sister Ellen Kettle immunising Aboriginal people at Kalkarindji in 1957. Sister Ellen Kettle's trunk on display at the Northern Territory Library. Kettle used this trunk to store her papers and as a desk. Kettle commenced nursing on the Aboriginal settlement of Yuendumu about from 300 kilometers from Alice Springs on 2 February 1952, where she was known as Nurse Kettle. She was the first permanent sister to be sent there by the Native Affairs Branch of the Northern Territory. Ellen describes her surroundings after commencing at the Yuendumu Clinic as ‚Äúthere were about 400 desert people, few of whom knew any English and I didn‚Äôt their language. Both the hospital and my living quarters were of unlined wartime camouflaged iron with no electricity or reticulated water‚Äù. In 1954, Ellen was appointed the Commonwealth Department of Health‚Äôs first Rural Survey Sister pioneering mobile health work in isolated areas throughout the Northern Territory, visiting all church missions, Government settlements and large cattle stations. This saw the commencement of a register of Aboriginal births and deaths. Over the next five decades, she almost single-handedly revolutionised Aboriginal health care in the Northern Territory by documenting the health status of Indigenous communities and attempting to draw attention to the plight of Aboriginal health, particularly in regard to the high infant mortality rates. In 1958, she began work on introducing standardised records and weight graphs for infants under five years of age. This data was used to publish a weight and height curve for Aboriginal children in 1966. Kettle won the $5000 H. J. Heinz nursing scholarship in 1966 to support her to study in Africa and India. She worked as the matron in charge of nursing at Department of Health in Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea in 1969. She was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for her services to nursing in 1967. She died in Darwin on 2 August 1999 at the age of 77.

She was the first woman to be elected to local council in the Northern Territory. Early life Dean was born in Western Australia and from an early age was interested in photography. In 1914 she was working as an assistant to a photographer retouching and colouring. After doing his job when he took ill one day she was totally committed to photography for her lifetime. She spent time in Sydney before going to New Guinea for seven years. She was evacuated to Sydney when the Second World War began and working as an assistant for a city photographer, Norton Travaire. Over the next seven years she covered an average of 24 weddings each weekend. At the end of the evening, she would ask for the bridal car to drive her home. Photography A portrait of Eric Charles Izod taken by Lillian Dean In 1947 Dean and her colourist Margaret Dewhurst, decided to try working as a travelling photographic team. Arriving in Darwin in 1947 they discovered there was a real need for professional photographers. For the first two years they would do several months of photography and then drive back to Sydney to do the film processing after which they drove back to Darwin to deliver the product. They decided to open a shop in Darwin. Despite white ants destroying one of their cameras before it was unpacked they opened on time and were gratefully welcomed. Their first studio was in an old wartime hut on Daly Street. Initially they had trouble with prowlers, but the installation of floodlights scared off the potential thieves. One was arrested and sent to jail, but returned to the shop upon his release to have his photo taken. She travelled regularly throughout the Territory as a photographer. Dean recounted some interesting and sometimes amusing incidents, like falling into a grave whilst trying to photograph funeral proceedings. When Albert Namatjira came to Darwin and saw the sea for the first time, and then painted it, she was asked to photograph him. Apart from the many weddings she also processed the many photographs that Bill Harney used for his stories of the Northern Territory. She estimated there were around 4,000 of those photos. Dean also specialised in portraits and did many for the Greek population, \\"touching up\\" where necessary. These were often to send back to family in Greece, and in some cases were used where a man was seeking a wife from Greece. Her work also regularly appeared in local newspapers. Eventually Dean moved the shop to Knuckey Street where it remained until she left Darwin in 1971. She also owned land in Fannie Bay. Politics Dean became the first woman to be elected to local government. She served on Darwin City Council from 1958 to 1961, lost the next election, but was re elected in 1966 for a further three years, representing the Fannie Bay area. She was considered an effective and parochial councillor, and was noted for her success in moving that a 25 mph speed limit be enforced over a dangerous section of Gilruth Avenue, which had been the site of many accidents. Dean maintained a keen interest in horse racing and served on the Darwin Turf Club Committee for ten years. She owned and raced a horse named \\"Gentleman.\\" As well, she was a foundation member of the Darwin branch of the Royal Commonwealth Society and the Darwin Bowls Club, and helped establish the Automobile Association of the Northern Territory. She was an active fundraiser for local charities, and friends described her as outgoing, social, strong willed, and determined on issues which mattered to her. Later life Dean retired to Sydney in 1971 after visiting her only child, a daughter, Hazel, in New Guinea. She died on 7 June 1980 at 81 years of age after a long illness.

Until the First World War they also leased Northbourne Court in Kent as their English residence.Downing, pp. 222‚Äì23, 237, 259. They had three children, Gordon (1903‚Äì1987), John (1909‚Äì1942) and Carinthia (1911‚Äì1995, known as Kinta).Downing, pp. 222, 238, 244, 274, 281, 296. In her autobiography, Kinta wrote: \\"It was often said of my parents that they had all of the luxuries of life but none of the necessities.\\"Michael Frank, \\"Sad Youth and Beauty in Tuscany: A Tuscan Childhood by Kinta Beevor\\", Los Angeles Times, 5 May 1999.Nancy McKeon, \\"Vineyards and Villas\\", The Washington Post, 6 June 1999. During the First World War, the Italian Socialists spread anti-British propaganda, which Lina Waterfield sought to counter. In 1916 she founded a British centre in the form of a library in Florence; with the assistance of John Buchan, at the time a leading propagandist in London, this became the British Institute of Florence, the first such institution, and was officially opened by the British ambassador in 1918; she later received the OBE for it.Downing, pp. 248‚Äì49. She became Italian correspondent for The Observer in 1921.Downing, p. 257.David Ayerst, Garvin of the Observer, London / Sydney: Croom Helm, 1985, , p. 196. She interviewed Mussolini several times before and after his rise to powerBoyana Georgieva, \\"The Waterfields of Tuscany\\", British Institute of Florence, 20 May 2014. and clearly described Fascist brutality in her reports.Downing, pp. 257‚Äì60.Ayerst, pp. 245‚Äì46. J. L. Garvin, the editor, ultimately ended her position with The Observer in 1935 over the strength of her aversion to Fascism; he believed Britain must maintain a relationship with Italy to forestall its becoming allied with Hitler's Germany.Downing, p. 273.Ayerst, pp. 252‚Äì54. Janet Ross died in 1927. She bequeathed Poggio Gherardo to the Waterfields' second son, John, with a life interest for Lina, and it became their primary residence. They left Italy after the outbreak of the , returning during the Phony War and finally catching the last train to France after a friend at the British Embassy sent them word on the eve of Italy's declaration of war in June 1940. John was killed in active service in Malta in 1942 and Aubrey died in 1944. After war's end Lina returned to Poggio Gherardo in January 1946, having been invited by Ian Fleming to be the Italian correspondent for The Sunday Times. He sent her telegrams requesting reports on such topics as what the Italians did \\"on a bender\\".Andrew Lycett, Ian Fleming, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1995, , p. 170. She continued as correspondent for Kemsley Newspapers until 1950, when she sold the estate and moved back to the Fortezza della Brunella; in 1952 she returned to England to live with her daughter Kinta in Kent. She died in Sandwich in 1964.Downing, pp. 272‚Äì79. Lina Waterfield was progressive in her politics since her adoption by the Rosses, when she decorated the walls of her room with pictures of heroes of the Risorgimento and refused to be presented at Court.Downing, p. 180. By 1914 she was a suffragette.Downing, p. 242.

She was commissioned to write The Story of Palermo, to be illustrated by her husband, but Dent decided instead to have Lina co-write and Aubrey illustrate Rome and Its Story (1904).Downing, pp. 212, 222. She later wrote Concise and Practical Guide to Rome (1905) and after the Second World War Florence: A Short Guide to the Art Treasures of Florence (1950).

It is a ground orchid with a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf and a single pink flower with a brownish-pink back. The flowers are short-lived and self-pollinating. Description Caladenia pusilla is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, sparsely hairy leaf, long, wide. A single flower long and wide is borne on a relatively thick spike tall. The flower is pink with a brownish-pink back and often a white centre. The dorsal sepal is erect at its base but curves forward and is long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide and are partly joined to each other. The petals are long and about wide and spread widely. The labellum is white or pink with red bars and is long and wide. The sides of the labellum sometimes have a few short teeth near the tip which curls under. There are two rows of stalked calli with yellow heads along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November but the flowers are only open for a day or two, sometimes barely open and are self-pollinating. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia pusilla was first formally described in 1980 by Winifred Curtis from a specimen found on King Island and the description was published in The Student's Flora of Tasmania. The specific epithet (pusilla) is a Latin word meaning \\"very small\\", \\"little\\" or \\"pretty\\". Distribution and habitat This orchid is widespread but localised in Victoria where it usually grows in moist coastal heath, sometimes in forests further inland. It grows in similar habitats in New South Wales south from Wellington. South Australian examples are found in the south- eastern corner of that state, especially on the Yorke Peninsula and Kangaroo Island and in Tasmania it grows in coastal areas, including on King and Flinders Islands. In New Zealand it grows in scrub on the North Island. Conservation Caladenia pusilla is listed as \\"rare\\" under the Tasmanian Government Threatened Species Protection Act 1995.

Life In 1752 Belli replaced the castrato Giovanni Bindi who had died in 1750 as secundo uomo in Dresden. That was the beginning of his career. During the Seven Years' War he returned to Italy, and died in Naples at the beginning of 1760, when he was fatally stabbed one day before the premiere of Johann Adolph Hasse's new opera.

He was tall (as all castrati were), lean, with pale complexion, face like an angel and big eyes. As Johann Joachim Winckelmann reports in a letter to his friend on 30 September 1758: \\"In the evening I am going to the opera [....] I am in Dresden, for the Pilaja is singing, and Lenzi and his wife are dancing. The beautiful, indeed the most beautiful, Belli is going to sing today\\"J.J. Winckelmann: Letter to Johann Michael Francke (1717-1775) of 30 September 1758 from Florence, cited from: J. Schultze, H.

Berlin: Schlesinger, 1824, p. 308 (Google Books: online version) But when the Seven Years' War started, he, Hasse and many other singers went to Italy. Belli remained in contact with Hasse and continued to sing for him.

In his letter, he again refers to the particular beauty of Belli: one might think that he shared a predilection for the singer, as might be suggested by Rabener.

He is now known for investigations on cholera, which may have anticipated the discovery of the responsible micro-organism by Robert Koch Life Born on 18 October 1819 in Bristol, he was the second son of John Champeny Swayne, a lecturer on midwifery in the Bristol medical school; his mother was the eldest daughter of Thomas Griffiths, an apothecary in Bristol. After education at Bristol college, where one of his teachers was Francis William Newman, he was apprenticed to his father and at the same time studied at the medical school and the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Swayne went on to Guy's Hospital and became M.R.C.S. and a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1841. He also studied in Paris, and in 1842 graduated M.B. at the University of London, obtaining the gold medal in obstetric medicine and being bracketed with Alfred Baring Garrod for the gold medal in medicine. In 1845 he proceeded M.D. at London and joined his father as lecturer on midwifery in the Bristol medical school; he was sole lecturer from 1850 until 1895, when he was appointed emeritus professor. In 1853 he was elected physician accoucheur to the Bristol General Hospital, one of the first appointments of the kind out of London; he held this post until 1875, when he became consulting obstetric physician. As a reputed consultant, Swayne had a large practice in the west of England. He was ahead of his time in stressing asepsis, and deprecated long hair or beards for those involved surgery or midwifery. He died suddenly on 1 August 1903, and was buried at Arno's Vale cemetery, Bristol. Works By 1843 Swayne was investigating cholera. In autumn 1849 the Second Cholera pandemic was threatening the city of Bristol, and the Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Society appointed a \\"microscopic committee\\" to look into the disease: it included Frederick Brittan, William Budd and others, as well as Swayne.G. Munro Smith, Cholera Epidemics in Bristol in the Nineteenth Century, The British Medical Journal Vol. 2, No. 2845 (Jul. 10, 1915), p. 60. Published by: BMJ. He described a micro-organism that some have suggested was the \\"comma bacillus\\" which Robert Koch proved to be the cause of the disease in 1884. He took it to be a \\"fungus cell\\", and solicited help with verifying his research from microscopists including Arthur Hill Hassall and Edwin Lankester. George Busk, however, argued that the observation was of a uredo, that is, a fungal plant pathogen. The Royal College of Physicians shortly declared the matter closed.Francis Fowke, On The First Discovery of The Comma-Bacillus of Cholera, The British Medical Journal Vol. 1, No. 1264 (Mar. 21, 1885), pp. 589‚Äì592.

With the advent of the internet, blogs and online magazines have proliferated reflecting the community's multitudinous religious, political, and cultural orientations. AJN and other news sources The primary Australian Jewish news source is The Australian Jewish News (also known as The AJN), a hard copy weekly that also produces a website; owned by Robert Magid and edited by Zeddy Lawrence. Its major rival is an online news magazine, J-Wire, which publishes similar content. It is owned and operated by Henry Benjamin. A recent entry into the market is the free monthly hard copy newspaper, The Jewish Report, which bills itself as a tool for fostering social cohesion.' Literary publications Alongside zines, and other community newsletters, Melbourne Jewry produced two literary journals, the Melbourne Chronicle, in the 1980s and Generation Magazine. The Melbourne Chronicle initially produced a companion Yiddish edition; however, like the Australian Jewish News, which also published additional material in Yiddish, the dwindling Yiddish-speaking market proved incapable of supporting it. After Generation Magazine ceased publication in the 1990s, there was a period in which there was no dedicated publication for Australian Jewish literary expression. In 2009, however, a group of young Jewish writers launched the online magazine, Galus Australis. It billed itself as a pluralist space for the discussion of Jewish Australian ideas and stories, but it ceased publication in 2015. Jewish Women of Words is the newest literary venture in the Australian Jewish media scene. Jewish blogs Australian Jewry's religious and political diversity is best reflected in its blogs. The conservative collective blog, known as Jews Down Under/ publishes opinion pieces arguing from a right wing Zionist perspective; while the Australian Jewish Democratic Society and +61J publish content more critical of the Israeli government. Notable individual blogs have similarly provided the community with a platform for expression. The first such blog, in 2009, to be reported in the wider Australian media was The Sensible Jew, written by Alex Fein. It provided controversial critiques of communal politics. Blogs such as Pitputim and The Fifth Chelek, meanwhile, concern themselves more with religious argument. Radio and television Radio and television have also provided the Jewish community with a broadcast outlet. The long running TV show, The Shtick, first airing on channel 31 and then moving to YouTube, features stories and segments about Jewish life in Melbourne. Melbourne Jewish Radio has also had a long tradition and the SBS station currently provides a service in Hebrew. The community attained a radio licence in 2011 and established the station, LionFM; however, this was short lived as its license was revoked. In its place is the community run radio organisation, J-Air, which bills itself as, 'the Jewish voice of Melbourne'.

Friis was initially a fortification officer and was commanding officer of the Field Telegraph Corps from 1928 to 1932 and of the Military Office of the Land Defence (Lantf√∂rsvarets kommandoexpedition) from 1932 to 1934. In 1934 he was commissioned to build the Swedish Air Force and was appointed Chief of the Air Force, a position he held until 1942 when he retired. Career Friis was born on 1 August 1882 in Malm√∂, Sweden, the son of vice consul Ernst Friis and his wife Sophie (n√©e Thom√©e) and brother of rear admiral Helge Friis (1883‚Äì1956). He passed studentexamen in 1900 and became an officer in 1902 with the rank of underl√∂jtnant the same year. Friis became lieutenant in the Royal Swedish Fortification (Kungliga Fortifikationen) in 1907 and graduated from the Artillery and Engineering College in 1908. Friis was promoted to captain in 1913 and served in the campaign with the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1916. He was a teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1918 to 1919 and at the Artillery and Engineering College from 1919 to 1921 and served as adjutant to the Crown Prince from 1920 to 1932. He became captain in the General Staff in 1921 and major in the General Staff in 1922. Friis (left) and lieutnant general Per Sylvan in 1940. Friis was head of department at the General Staff's Technical Department from 1922 to 1927 and was lieutenant colonel in the General Staff in 1926 and became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Swedish Fortification in 1928. He was commanding officer of the Field Telegraph Corps from 1928 to 1932 and was promoted to colonel in the Field Telegraph Corps in 1932. Friis was chief of the Military Office of the Land Defence (Lantf√∂rsvarets kommandoexpedition) from 1932 to 1934 and became major general in the Swedish Air Force in 1934. In April 1934, the then Chief of the Air Force major general Eric Virgin applied for a year's leave of absence, after Virgin and the Abyssinia government entered an agreements to which Virgin would function as chief adviser of the reorganization of the country's army. Friis took over as Chief of the Air Force and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1936. Friis was determined to make the Air Force as equal and effective weapon as one of the older military branches. Because of this he needed an Air Staff, which was also created by the Defence Act of 1936. The Air Force lacked a staff and pilot trained officer who could be appointed chief of staff. Friis therefore offered Bengt Nordenski√∂ld this position. Nordenski√∂ld often expressed opinions and criticism in an arrogant and hurtful way. He was often on matters of fact superior to his subordinates and opponents, but he found it difficult to acknowledge others work and listen to their arguments. Thereby he sometimes counteracted the Air Force interests, and he compromised at times that particular work satisfaction and the cohesion he sought. This prompted the defense minister Per Edvin Sk√∂ld and the Supreme Commander Olof Th√∂rnell in 1942 to appeal to Friis to remain as Chief of the Air Force. Although Friis shared Sk√∂ld's and Th√∂rnell's opinion on Nordenski√∂ld, Friis felt that Nordenski√∂ld had to succeed him if the Air Force would be able to keep up with the ever-accelerating development. Friis left the position as Chief of the Air Force in 1942 and was placed in the reserve the same year. He was then governor (st√•th√•llare) of Drottningholm Palace, Gripsholm Castle, Haga Palace, Rosersberg Palace, Stockholm Palace, Str√∂msholm Palace, Tullgarn Palace and Ulriksdal Palace from 1947 to 1962. Friis was standard-bearer of the Orders of His Majesty the King (Kungl. Maj:ts Orden) from 1949 and head of the Royal Djurg√•rden Administration (Kungliga Djurg√•rdens F√∂rvaltning) from 1949 to 1962. Friis became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1924 and was board member of Royal Automobile Club. Personal life In 1909 he married Lotty Salin (1887‚Äì1968), the daughter of professor Mauritz Salin and Bertha (n√©e Kempe). Friis was the father of Birgit (born 1910), Lotty (born 1914) and Bertha (1923‚Äì1997). Friis was the father in law of colonel Sven Thofelt (married to Birgit), doctor Ole Berg (married to Lotty) and count Karl-Hampus M√∂rner (married to Bertha). The Friis' acquired the G√∂rv√§ln House in 1937 where they lived until their death in 1967 and 1968.

His first book, Introducing Christian Ethics (1961), became a standard text in his field. He marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and met with Nikita Khrushchev to set up a college student exchange program with the Soviet Union. Education and early life Barnette was born on August 14, 1911, in Taylorsville, North Carolina. He dropped out of school in the sixth grade and his family moved to Kannapolis, North Carolina in 1925. He converted to Christianity there at the age of 19 and returned to school at age 22 on the advice of his pastor, Wade Jones. He graduated at age 26 and went on to study at Wake Forest College, from where he graduated with honors in 1940. After Wake Forest College, Barnette attended Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (\\"Southern\\") in Louisville, Kentucky, where he received a Masters in Theology and a PhD. He later studied at Harvard University, Columbia University and the University of Florida. Career Barnette's first teaching position was at Samford University (then Howard College), in Birmingham, Alabama, from 1946 to 1947 as a professor of sociology, followed by Stetson University in Florida from 1947 to 1951.

In all, he authored fifteen books. For most of his life, Barnette was a committed Baptist. He first converted to Christianity at the North Kannapolis Baptist Church in Kannapolis, North Carolina. He was ordained a minister in 1935. While at graduate school at Southern he ministered at the Haymarket Mission in Louisville, where he was head of the mission for three years, and was referred to as the \\"Bishop of the Haymarket\\". Later, having moved back to Louisville, he was a member of the Crescent Hill Baptist Church there. Social advocacy Barnette was focused on race as a social issue from at least 1946. He helped to found the Interracial Baptist Pastors Conference in Birmingham Alabama while at Samford. On June 7, 1954, Barnette testified before a subcommittee of Congress in favor of strengthening the role of the United Nations. In 1957, he met with Nikita Khrushchev at the Kremlin and helped establish an exchange program for college students between the United States and the Soviet Union.

It offers a full-time three-year fashion design education, and a variety of short and summer courses. It was formerly known as Margrethe-Skolen.  History  The Scandinavian Academy of Fashion Design (former Margrethe-Skolen) was founded by Margrethe Glad in 1931 and is named after the school's patroness Princess Margrethe of Bourbon-Parma. The reason for SAFD's success was partly thanks to Margrethe Glad's effective social network and her travels to Paris. She first went there to renew her wardrobe, returning later to buy models for manufacturing in Copenhagen. In addition, her language knowledge and pedagogical skills helped her along. In the period when the school was established, interest in courses on textiles was high even at the existing schools but SAFD's education in cutting and sewing elegant fashion designs with an international flavor was something quite new. Similarly, the study tours to Paris she arranged for the school's students were unusual at the time. In 1937, Margrethe Glad moved to Frederiksholms Canal, where SAFD was firmly established in the premises near the beach, and the students learned pattern cutting, sewing and draping based on French haute couture tailoring. After a few years, Margrethe Glad retired from the school, and in 1945, SAFD moved to Badstuestr√¶de led by Inga Madsen, who died in 2008. Thereafter Christina Beckman became director of the school. From 1953 the school was located on √òstergade, but in 2012 it moved back to larger and newer facilities in Badstuestr√¶de. The school officially changed its name in 2017 when Margrethe-Skolen became Scandinavian Academy of Fashion Design (SAFD). SAFD is located in the heart of Copenhagen and has, for more than 85 years, trained many of the leading designers, stylists and business people in the Danish and international world of fashion. Today it is internationally known and respected, according to Createur Erik Mortensen: ‚ÄúNot only having interpreted and taught about fashion, but also having insisted on inspiring students to discover the heart of all forms of creativity, fashion and aesthetics. The school has maintained an admirable level of prestige which is too high for those who intend to accept the easiest solutions.‚Äú Graduates of SAFD have achieved great recognition and success both nationally and internationally. Amongst others, can be named: Margit Brandt, Henriette Zobel, Susanne Rutzou, Bendikte Utzon, Princess Benedikte, Rene Gurskov, Rikke Ruhwald and Bitte Kai Rand. Her Royal Highness Princess Benedikte of Denmark is the school's protector and has established a fund from which the annual Benedikte Prize is awarded. It was an honour and a pleasure when the princess herself graduated from the school and she has kept close contact with the institution since that time.  Mission and activities  Copenhagen campus, student working SAFD's strength lies in its creative approach to education in design. The positive, dynamic and creative atmosphere of the school stimulates the students to develop their personality, originality and individuality. This is a development which, through fundamental, factual and creative studies, endows the graduating student with an ability to realise design projects for industry, brands or their own production. Achieving this result demands exertion and stamina. Students have to endure hard work to gain the basic tools of the trade in order to create new forms and show originality in their designs. They must be clever enough in their sketching to give expression to both creative and technical drawings so that these can be used as guidelines in the process towards the optimal solution. Throughout the education, the students will be challenged to exceed their own limits, to create new forms, materials handling and color combinations. The goal is through craft skills to achieve innovative and new interpretations of what already exists. Through research and design process, the students gets a basic understanding of inspiration, shape and depth, elements which are essential to move forward in the design process. The aim is that the students should be able to combine their natural creative aspect of the art, so the issues that the business will make them can be solved in a highly professional manner. At the same time, it is the students duty to contribute to modern society with innovation, quality and sustainability.  Networks and partnerships  SAFD fashion show during Copenhagen Fashion Week SAFD is a member of the network organization Danish Fashion Institute, which was founded by and for the Danish fashion industry. This means that members are helping to support the vision to strengthen the industry and get Danish fashion positioned internationally. It is also part of a strong network, where the best of Danish fashion are represented. SAFD is also member of Danish Fashion & Textile, also known as DM&T;, has been the industry‚Äôs natural point since 1895, and is today a modern industry and employer organization with insight into members‚Äô daily lives and the challenges that the industry faces.

It will cater for the inevitable economic recovery and growth when it returns.\\" =Ngai Tahu Joint Ventures= Initial Ventures On 26 November 2007, the Herald announced that NgƒÅi Tahu and Tainui had met at Arowhenua Marae in South Canterbury and signed deals to establish formal intentions on 23 November 2007 to work together, using a memorandum of understanding to form a basis to establish a working environment between the two iwi. New Zealand Labour Party MP Shane Jones said, \\"You need to remember that Maori trusts and iwi organisations, they're very rarely sellers. They like to hold assets for a long, long time, and given the amount of foreign ownership in the economy, it's good that tribes work together and help to buy back some of those assets that looked lost.\\" As the first joint-activity of the two tribes, in February 2009, NgƒÅi Tahu acquired 6% of Ryman Healthcare and subsequently on-sold 4.5% to Tainui; raisings its shareholding in Ryman to 8%, and establishing Tainui as a shareholder.

The contracts commenced in October 2016, and GoBus is supplying 89 buses, most of which are brand new low-emission buses built locally in New Zealand. The company said it would invest $40 million in new vehicles and equipment as well as establishing two new depot facilities, providing over 250 new driver and management jobs.

She was joined by her domestic partner, Todd Hunter (of Dragon, also ex-XL Capris), on bass guitar and keyboards, and session musicians. They released two albums, So Far 1983-1985 (December 1985) and Pop Art (mid-1986). Scribble disbanded in 1987 with Pigott focussing on her song writing.  History  Johanna Pigott formed Scribble as a synth pop band in Sydney in 1983, the year after her previous group, XL Capris had disbanded. For her new group Pigott provided lead vocals, guitar, piano and keyboards. She recruited her domestic partner (later her husband), Todd Hunter, on bass guitar and keyboards. Hunter was also a member of the rock group, Dragon, and had been her bandmate in XL Capris. 150px In November 1983 the group issued a seven-track extended play, Scribble, on Regular/WEA. Session musicians with Pigott and Hunter were Jeff Oakes on saxophone, Michel Rose on pedal steel and Keith Stirling on trumpet. It provided their debut single, \\"Silly Girl\\", in the same month, with cover art depicting a dark forest and the band's name stylised as bare trees. The track was written by Pigott. Note: User may have to click \\"Search again\\" and provide details at \\"Enter a title:\\" e.g. Silly Girl; or at \\"Performer:\\" Scribble Its music video showed a wistful Pigott singing and playing guitar. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described their sound as \\"winsome, witty pop.\\" Christine Nestel of The Canberra Times opined that \\"[their] first album met with critical acclaim.\\" The group's second single, \\"Adaptability\\", followed a year later in November 1984. The track was co-written by Pigott, Hunter and their former XL Capris bandmate, Tim Gooding; it was used for the theme of a children's TV show, The Cartoon Connection (from 1985). Regular Records released a compilation album, So Far 1983-1985, in December 1985 on Regular/Festival Records. To promote the album Pigott and Hunter assembled a touring version of Scribble with Lee Borkman on keyboards and keyboard bass, Mike Caen on guitar and backing vocals (both ex-Pink Slips), and Tim Powles on drums (ex-Ward 13, on loan from the Venetians). That line-up recorded a studio album, Pop Art, which was issued in mid-1986 via Regular/Festival. Its cover depicts a pop art stylised version of Pigott. Hunter produced the album. Pigott described her preference when performing, \\"Just singing, you can actually concentrate on entertaining rather than playing in tune. When you play and sing you have to concentrate on so many things ‚Äì you're thinking is the amp right, is the mike OK, are you singing in tune. It's a real luxury just being able to relate to the audience without all those things to worry about.\\" By that time the line-up was Pigott, Hunter, Borkman and Caen joined by Neville Anderson (also ex-Pink Slips) on drums, Mark Bell on guitar (ex- Blam Blam Blam, Coconut Rough) and Sandy Chick on backing vocals (ex- Rockmelons). 150px The album had ten tracks, including three singles: \\"Sunday School\\" (April 1986), \\"Don't Give Your Heart Away\\" (July) and \\"Alligator\\" (November) ‚Äì all are co-written by Pigott and Hunter.

The Canberra Times Laurence Boswell declared that their recorded sound was \\"soft and smooth\\" compared with their live show, which was \\"harder and heavier ‚Äî partly due to the guitar work of [Bell].\\" At the end of 1986 the group's line-up was Pigott, Bell, Nicolette Boaz on keyboards, Bill Heckenberg on drums and Geoff Lundren on bass guitar.Scribble and related entries at Australian Rock Database: * Scribble: * Johanna Pigott (1983‚Äì87): * XL Capris: * Lee Borkman (1985‚Äì86): * Mike Caen (1985‚Äì86): * Bill Heckenberg (1986‚Äì87): * Melanie Oxley (1986): * Tim Powles (1985‚Äì86): Hunter had returned to his work with Dragon.

Early life  Reeves was born in Wichita Falls, Texas on June 20, 1940. He retired from the Army in 1985.  First wife  Reeves' first marriage was at 18 to a 15-year-old. The marriage was annulled in 1960.  Manslaughter  Reeves married Sharon Vaughn in 1961. In 1967, while stationed with his wife in Italy, Reeves killed a man and served four months in prison for manslaughter. After his release, the couple returned to the United States and settled in Copperas Cove, Texas.  Second wife  Reeves was married to his second wife for 18 years. They had two sons, Ricky and Randall, while in Italy. In 1977, Sharon pursued an extramarital relationship with John Behneman. She filed for divorce in February 1978 while Reeves was stationed in South Korea. On July 20, 1978, a week after divorcing Reeves, she died of a shotgun wound to her chest that was originally believed to be self-inflicted. The case was re-examined in 1994 and it was determined that she had been murdered. The prosecution demonstrated in court how difficult it would have been for her to shoot herself. A blood spatter expert concluded that Sharon had been wearing a bra and underwear at the time of her death, but when her body was found, she was completely naked. She was 34.  Third wife  Reeves married Myong Hui Chong on Dec. 31, 1980 in South Korea. She drowned in Lake Whitney in Texas in 1986. Her family said Myong was unable to swim and had a strong aversion to water. Bruises on Myong's face made her sister suspicious and she requested an autopsy. Reeves had Myong cremated.  Fourth wife  Reeves met his fourth wife, Emilita Villa, through a mail-order bride service when she was 18. Reeves was 28 years her senior. Emilita was reportedly reluctant to marry him, but felt obligated due to monthly payments Reeves sent to her family in the Philippines. When Emilita became pregnant, Reeves sent her back to her family as he didn't believe he was the father. He changed his mind when she sent him a photograph of their son. She was last seen alive October 11, 1994. She disappeared shortly after telling friends she intended to divorce Reeves. In October 1995, her remains were found by a hunter in a shallow grave near Lake Whitney, where Reeves' third wife had drowned eight years previously.  Investigation and arrest  Emilita's friend reported her missing. The police became suspicious when they found out Reeves had two dead wives, both of whom died after making plans to leave Reeves and after complaining to friends about being mistreated by Reeves. He was arrested on March 21, 1995 for the murder of his second wife and his bail was set at $500,000.  Trial  He was convicted on Jan. 3, 1996 for the 1978 murder of Sharon Reeves and received a 35-year prison sentence. On Aug. 20, 1996, he was convicted of murdering Emilita Reeves and sentenced to an additional 99 years. Reeves appealed against both convictions; his appeals were rejected. His sentences are being served concurrently. He will be eligible for parole in 2026.

It was first established as Drohobych Petroleum Technical College in 1945, transforming into Petroleum and Gas College in 2012. It is the alma mater of many Ukrainian scientists, businessmen and politicians. History =Ukrainian SSR= Drohobych Petroleum and Gas College was founded as Drohobych Petroleum Technical College on January 20, 1945 (Decree ‚Ññ58 of the Ukrainian Government). Since its establishment the school trained over 20 thousand specialists in oil, gas and their refining industry. The first graduation ceremony was held in 1948. Given the increasing demand for industry specialists by Carpathian region companies, college opened a branch department in Boryslav in, 1953. Evening courses were dedicated to specialists training in the fields of \\"Exploitation of oil and gas wells\\" and \\"The technology of oil and gas\\". In 1957 Drohobych Petroleum Technical College was merged with Lviv College of Petroleum Refining. In 1958 college established distance- learning department, conducting training of specialists in the fields of \\"Drilling oil and gas wells\\", \\"Exploitation of oil and gas wells\\", \\"Equipment of oil and gas industries\\" and \\"Chemical technology of oil and gas\\". In 1959 a new branch (evening school) was opened in Dolyna with the following disciplines offered: \\"Exploitation of oil and gas wells\\", \\"Equipment oil and gas industry\\" and \\"Oil and gas industry enterprises planning\\". Due to the decrease in the number of applicants for evening departments, Boryslav and Dolyna branches ceased operations in 1973 and 1975 respectively. =Post- Declaration= In 1997 Petroleum Technical College received a license qualifying it for training junior specialists in the field of \\"Banking\\" and \\"Gas and oil exploitation and storage management\\". Currently, the college prepares specialists in nearly all specialties related to oil and gas extraction and processing. In December 2006, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (Decree ‚Ññ64) accredited Petroleum Technical College as a higher educational institution of the first level and issued its first certificate of accreditation (license serial no. AB482982) granting college the right to provide educational services related to obtaining higher education level qualification \\"junior specialist\\". In August 2012 college was renamed to \\"State Higher Educational Institution \\"Drohobych Petroleum and Gas College\\" (Decree ‚Ññ870 of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine). College today College training is based on primary and secondary education on a full-time, part-time and distance learning basis. Total student population: 1600. Annual college intake ranges from 330 to 400 students. 46 of 99 teaching staff are lecturers of the first category, 7 - teaching Methodists, 3 PhDs, 4 Candidates of Science. The College operates in conjunction with the Ivano- Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas, Kiev Polytechnic Institute and Dnipro State Chemical Technology University. College is also represented as educational consulting office of Ivano-Frankivsk National Technical University of Oil and Gas where alumni may continue their education at university of IV-th accreditation level.

He served in the Republic of China Navy from 1954 to 1997, retiring with the rank of admiral. He was a member of the Legislative Yuan from 2002 until his death. Military career Born Shanghai in 1931, Ku attended both the Republic of China Naval Academy and the United States Naval Academy, and entered the Republic of China Navy in 1954. He became close to Chen Shui-bian while serving as deputy defense minister between 1993 and 1994. As commander of the navy, a post he had assumed in 1994, Ku ended the Advanced Combat System, a program devised in the 1980s by Taiwan to develop a smaller version of the American-made Aegis Combat System. During his tenure, Ku reached an agreement with the United States Navy that allowed the Republic of China Navy use of American rescue vessels, if needed. Political career Ku became the Republic of China's representative to the Netherlands in 1997. Chen Shui-bian assumed the presidency in 2000, and due to the friendship between Chen and Ku, it was speculated that Ku would accept an appointment as minister of defense in the Chen administration, a post that went to Wu Shih-wen. After three years as a diplomat, Ku was recalled and expected to retire. However, Ku was named to the People First Party proportional representation ballot in 2001. For accepting the nomination, he was expelled from the Kuomintang. He was strongly opposed to a 2002 proposal to acquire Kidd-class destroyers from the United States, favoring the purchase of Aegis-enabled vessels instead. Ku was critical of a separate plan to buy Standard SM-II missiles for over NT$40 million each. In 2003, Ku published a book about his naval career and joined the Friends of the PFP. The next year, two members of the United States House of Representatives proposed that Taiwan send the Republic of China Marine Corps to engage in the Iraq War, a move Ku believed to be unnecessary. He was involved in another discussion about the cost of arms procurement in October, over a set of special appropriations that cost NT$610.8 billion. Ku was again named a PFP at-large legislative candidate for the 2004 elections, and won. In 2005, he voted against an arms procurement bill that sought to fund a $480 billion purchase of eight diesel submarines along with missile batteries and military aircraft, berating the government for its dependence on the United States. Ku was hospitalized in November 2006, and died of lymphatic cancer at Tri-Service General Hospital on 15 January 2007, aged 75.

Its primary purpose was to demonstrate its wearer's allegiance to the cause of women's suffrage in the UK. Jewellery was a key mechanism used by British suffragists to identify themselves. Gold earrings in suffragette colours  Visual style  The suffragettes, in particular, successfully embraced the language of contemporary fashion - including its emphasis on delicate femininity - as a strategy for increasing the popular appeal of their movement and dodging the stereotype of the 'masculine' women's rights campaigner. As fashion lecturer Cally Blackman notes, \\"Membership numbers grew, and it became fashionable to identify with the struggle for the vote, even if only by wearing a small piece of jewellery picked out in semi-precious coloured stones or enamel.\\" Most suffragette jewellery featured the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) colours: purple, white, and green. There is some disagreement over who designed this visual branding - either prominent WSPU member Sylvia Pankhurst, who had trained at the Manchester School of Art and the Royal College of Art or Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, co-editor of Votes for Women. Association with the suffragette cause became so fashionable by 1908 that Mappin & Webb, holders of royal warrants for jewellery since 1897, issued a catalogue of suffragette jewellery. There appear to have been close links between the suffragettes and the artists of the Arts and Crafts movement.  Known designers  * Sylvia Pankhurst * Ernestine Mills * Georgie Gaskin * Arthur Gaskin * R C Price  Themes  Popular designs for suffrage jewellery included Sylvia Pankhurst's 'Angel of Freedom' design, hatpins in the shape of an arrow to evoke the prison convict's arrow, and badges displaying photos of the WSPU leaders.  Authentication and contested artifacts  Some writers, particularly those focused on the collectors' market, argue that the significance of jewellery as a means of self- identification with the Suffragette Movement is overstated, due to the popularity of these jewellery colours before and after the period in which suffragettes were most active. However, as scholar Elizabeth Goring notes, the purple-white-green colour combination was deeply symbolic of the Suffragette Movement and the use of these colours \\"offered a powerful means by which suffragettes could publicly advertise their identity,\\" and would not be construed as merely decorative by others. The dearth of items identified explicitly as suffragette jewellery in major collections can be partly attributed to the difficulty of using colour alone, without specific date of origin or other documentation, to distinguish this jewellery from other Edwardian jewellery. Association of medals with the Suffragette Movement is more straightforward, and in 2015 the gallantry medal awarded to Mary Aldham was sold at auction for ¬£23,450. The Museum of London permanent collection contains an example of a bespoke piece of suffragette jewellery with clear provenance, created by Ernestine Mills to commemorate the release from Holloway Prison of Louise Mary Eates, Secretary of Kensington Women's Social and Political Union.

She was born on 13 August 1863 in Paris and died in Paris in 1938. She married √âdouard Jacquemin, but later left him to live with the engraver Auguste Lauzet, a friend of Vincent Van Gogh.  Personal life  She married √âdouard Paul F√©licien Jacquemin, a member of Paul Verlaine's circle, on December 13, 1881. √âdouard ultimately abandoned her, and some time later she moved in with the engraver August-Marie Lauzet. Details of her personal life were mired in controversy and misinformation during her lifetime. Leslie Stewart Curtis has claimed that, \\"If Jacquemin and her art have been largely forgotten, it is no doubt related to the infamy she had acquired among her art world contemporaries. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that she was consciously expunged from written records.\\" However, this can also be attributed, in part, to the relatively scarcity of her surviving works.  Career  Information about her artistic training remains unclear. She has been linked to the little-known artists L√©onide Josephine Leblanc, Jean- Charles Cazin, Edouard Pils, and L√©on Bonnat. Jacquemin exhibited approximately 40 works during her lifetime, most of which were executed in pastel and few of which are extant today. She exhibited at Le Barc de Boutteville gallery in Paris between 1892 and 1897, at the Impressionist and Symbolist exhibitions, at the Salon de La Plume and the galerie Bing. In Brussels, Octave Maus invited her to exhibit at the Salon des XX. During her time there, she associated with Georges Rodenbach. At Le Barc de Boutteville, she became affiliated with Alfred Vallette and Remy du Gourmont.  Work  Jacquemin's art was influenced by Puvis de Chavannes, Edward Burne-Jones, Odilon Redon, and Gustave Moreau. Describing the works she exhibited in the 1894 \\"Peintres Impressionistes et Symbolistes\\" exhibition at Le Barc de Boutteville, the critic Ren√© Barjean wrote that \\"the emotional intensity of the faces explored by Madame Jeanne Jacquemin enchants and will always enchant the poets.\\" Her work, like that of her Symbolist contemporaries, addresses mysticism, dream states, nature, and la douleur, or pain. The particular brand of isolation and otherworldliness found in her works coincides with an ambivalent figuration of gender. Her treatment of the \\"female androgyne\\" has been associated with the efforts of female Symbolist artists to explore psychic states \\"not confined to masculine sensibilities,\\" but that do not necessarily put forward a counter-model of \\"essentialized female sensibility.\\" Her portrait of Saint Georges, for example, has been interpreted by some as a self-portrait, due in part to the figure's delicate facial features and long red hair. Her works include: * La Douloureuse et glorieuse couronne (The Crown of Thorns) (pastel on paper, 1892, private collection, Paris) * Le Coeur d'eau (pastel on paper, 1892, Mus√©e de Folklore at Maison Tournaisienne) * Christ √† la couronne d'√©pines (lithograph published in Le Courrier Fran√ßais, Jun 23, 1895) * Saint Georges (color lithograph published in L'√âstampe modern no. 11, 1898) * R√™verie (alternately titled Daydream, M√©lancolie, and Mysteriosa), a signed worm that has been included in several Symbolist exhibitions in recent decades.

Works  Title page of Brihatpingal, published in Devanagari by Gujarati Sahitya Parishad, 1955 Pathak was a prolific writer of criticism, poetry, drama, metrics and short stories, and also edited and translated works of others. Pathak was profoundly influenced by Gandhian thought but retained his originality and literary exuberance. He wrote short stories under the pen name \\"Dwiref\\", poems under \\"Shesh\\" and essays under \\"Swairvihari\\". His literary career began with a critical article, \\"The poems of poet Balashankar Ullasram Kantharia\\", published in the first issue of Sabarmati in 1922. He also wrote literary observations for Yugdharm. Pathak is well known for his Gujarati short stories. He published three volume of short stories entitled Dwirefni Vato (1928, 1935, 1942). His most acclaimed stories are Mukundrai, Khemi and Jakshani. The first of these suggests that modern education degenerates human values; the second is of love between two members of the lower castes considered to be his most memorable characters; the third reflects his subtle sense of humor. His stories are emotionally linked with life. He published a collection of 68 poems, Sheshna Kavyo (1938), expanded to 73 in a second edition (1951). Visheshna Kavyo, his other collection of poems, was published posthumously in 1959.

Pathak did extensive research in metres of poetry published as Brihat Pingal, for which he was recognized with the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1956. It is a scientific presentation of structure and history of Gujarati prosody. He co-edited several works with Umashankar Joshi; Kavyatatvavichar (1939), Sahityavichar (1942), Digdarshan (1942), Vicharmadhuri: Part 1 (1946).

In his book Politics and the Novel in India, Gopalan V. Gopalan wrote that Pathak's 1937 Aavtikal (Lit. Tomorrow) is characterised by the Gandhian principle of non-violence, trade unionism and the Gandhian ideal of cottage and village industries. But, according to Gujarati Sahityakosh (Encyclopedia of Gujarati literature) Vol. 2, Pathak had never written any novel. According to Gujarati Sahityakosh, the novel Aavtikal, published in 1936, was written by Ramnarayan Nagardas Pathak (1905‚Äì1988), another Gujarati writer associated with Gandhi's satyagraha movement.

Wollen uses that social media site as a platform for her 'Sad Girl Theory', which includes the notion of sadness as a form of power, and the idea that female sadness and self-loathing might include elements of empowerment. According to Wollen, this empowerment may ultimately lead to women uniting. Wollen uses her Instagram feed as an art gallery where she uses her body in her art by objectifying it and putting herself into famous paintings, among other methods. Wollen describes her work as a methodology of survival, a method for rethinking \\"looking\\" and \\"being.\\" Wollen is inspired by feminist philosopher Judith Butler and Butler's theory of gender performativity. In her artwork, Wollen makes visible the performative aspects of online existence and activity and how identity is constructed. According to Wollen there is no distinct binary between \\"the real\\" or authentic and performance; instead, the artist makes visible how performance is an inevitable aspect of online activities (as well as \\"everyday life\\"), and how subjects are mediated through technology and language.  Sad Girl Theory Sad Girl Theory is the proposal that the sadness of girls should be witnessed and re-historicized as an act of resistance and political protest. Wollen states that girls being sad has been categorized as an act of passivity, and therefore discounted from the history of activism. According to Wollen, political protest doesn‚Äôt have to be external to the body. Wollen emphasizes that historically, girls have used their own anguish and suffering as tools for resistance and political agency. Sad Girl Theory is based on the notion that girls‚Äô sadness isn‚Äôt quiet, weak, shameful or dumb: It is active, autonomous, and articulate. It‚Äôs a way of fighting back. According to Wollen, the re-staging of girls' sadness and self- destruction as an act of political resistance opens up a new history of activism. \\"Revolt\\" might then be understood as something internal, personal and performed on our own bodies, emphasizing girls' agency. Wollen also states that the feminist struggle against patriarchal structures has yet to question patriarchal ideals and masculinist tactics of past revolutions, introducing a redefinition of what violence, activism and autonomy can mean for girls by looking at the actions that are already so pervasive in girl-culture (self- hate, sorrow, suffering and even suicide) and asserting them as scenes of protest. Wollen's Sad Girl Theory can be considered an academic response to the liberal feminist ideal that views women as the makers of their own success. Wollen states that feminism needs to acknowledge that being a woman in a patriarchal society inevitably is difficult and related to oppression and suffering; therefore, it is necessary to view the sadness of girls and women as an appropriate and informed reaction to patriarchal structures. Sad Girl Theory is a criticism of liberal ideals of womanhood that depict \\"the successful feminist\\" as famous, rich and happy. According to Wollen, this idea functions as a second oppression that implies that women who are not happy are responsible for the failure of their own emancipation. Sad Girl Theory provided inspiration for artist and writer Johanna Hedva's Sick Woman Theory, a project focused on chronic illness as an embodied form of political protest. Hedva claims, in response to Wollen's work, that she \\"was mainly concerned with the question of what happens to the sad girl when, if, she grows up.\\"  References  Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Feminist theorists Feminist artists ","title":"Audrey Wollen"},{"id":"53421339","text":"Synevyr National Nature Park () is one of National Parks in Ukraine, located in Zakarpattia Oblast, in southwest of the country.

It was founded in 1890 by Jules Wagemans in Maastricht, The Netherlands. Since 1998, Artifort is a Lande Group brand. The headquarters is located in Schijndel. The furniture is made in- house at the production-units in Schijndel, Lanaken, Belgium and Bursa, Turkey. Artifort furniture is known for its organic shapes, upholstery and is sold worldwide both in the contract and residential market. History In 1890 Jules Wagemans set up his upholstery business in Maastricht. His son Henricus Wagemans built this company up to furniture manufacturer ‚ÄòH. Wagemans & Van Tuinen‚Äô. In 1928, the brand name Artifort is introduced, which combines Art and Comfort.Artifort Interieur Design, Whoppah. Artifort‚Äôs breakthrough came in the 1930s when the company started to use Epeda interior springing. The springing is woven from one single steel wire which increases comfort, is more sustainable and saves production time. Initially Artifort made classic wooden furniture. In the 1950s Artifort took its first step along the path of innovative design with the Pingu√Øn and Congo chair designed by Theo Ruth. In 1958 Kho Liang Ie was appointed as aesthetic consultant. His vision, expertise and international network were determining factors in the successes of the 1960s and 1970s. Kho Liang Ie designs the new Artifort logo and recruits designers Pierre Paulin and Geoffrey D. Harcourt. Pierre Paulin introduces new production techniques and uses brightly colored stretch fabric to upholster the organic shapes of his designs. Paulin‚Äôs focus lay primarily with the challenge of addressing functionality and comfort, most notably showcased with his Mushroom chair, developed for Artifort in 1959 and now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Geoffrey Harcourt designs an extensive collection for the contract market that is very successful around the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, Nel Verschuuren, Bruno Ninaber van Eyben, Gijs Bakker and Jeremy Harvey create designs for Artifort. In the 1990s Artifort continued to collaborate with international designers like Jasper Morrison, Wolfgang Mezger, Ren√© Holten and Jan Pesman. In the 1990s, Artifort was acquired thrice. In 1990 by Steelcase Strafor, in 1994 by Samas and in 1998 by Lande Group. Today Artifort is still a Lande Group brand. In the 2000s and beyond, Artifort continued to collaborate with the next generation of international designers like Patrick Norguet and Claesson Koivisto Rune.

It is located at the end of the valley Wied il-Mielaƒß north of the village of Gƒßarb. This natural arch is less well- known than the Azure Window, which collapsed in March 2017 following a heavy storm. Location The Wied il-Mielah Window is at the end of the Wied il- Mielah Valley and is, unlike the more known Azure Window, on the west coast of Gozo. The road from Gƒßarb leads directly to the coast; parking is available on the plateau on natural ground. Directly at the end of the valley, parallel to the old river bed, there is a narrow staircase along the rock to just before the window, almost to the water. Since the ceiling of the window is still thick, you can still enter the window above. Environment The north coast from Gozo to the Xwejni Bay is characterized by a plateau, with steep cliffs, which slope down into the sea, where are many caves. On the plateau, artificial salt pans were used to extract salt from the seawater by evaporation. The hinterland rises slowly here, there is Gƒßarb and the lighthouse Giordan Lighthouse. Wastewater problem  In the past, the Wied il-Mielah Valley was responsible for discharging the wastewater from the surrounding municipalities to the Mediterranean directly at the Wied il-Mielah Window. The sewage flag was often clearly visible underneath the archway into the open sea.Sewage flowing at Wied il-Mielah, Times of Malta, 6.

Life  Born Lucy Brightman in Islington, London, on 22 March 1846, to Benjamin (a butcher) and Abigail (n√©e McNamara). It is believed that Lucy attended boarding school and later became a governess. Between 1847 and 1869, Benjamin and Abigail Brightman ran a coffee house and cafe in Duke Street, and then from 1874-1881 at King Street, Portman Square. In 1876, Lucy married pharmacist Henry Peck. They lived at 6 Derby Street, St Pancras, and they had two children: Ethel Frances Lucy (born August 1877) and Howard (born 1882). = The Dolls' Home Shop = In 1893, Lucy Peck established the now famous Dolls' Home shop at 131 Regent Street. She had previously had a Dolls' Warehouse at 5 Goodge Street from 1890 to 1892. The Peck family lived in apartments over the Regent Street shop. Lucy Peck's surviving notebooks record her methods for casting in Plaster of Paris and Modelling Wax. Lucy Peck specialised in portraits of Queen Victoria as a young girl, modelled after painted portraits. She created play dolls, with wire mechanisms for moving the eyes. She also created fashionable Victorian figures, with layers of clothing including lace petticoats and corsets, and accessories such as umbrellas and fans. The lease on the shop expired in 1908, and the Peck family moved to 162 Shepherd's Bush Road. The Dolls' Home re-opened at 215 High Street, Kensington, where Lucy Peck sold a large range of toys including automata, dolls prams, stuffed toys, dolls' houses and lanterns. Many of her toys and novelties such as Easter Eggs and printed cards were imported from Germany. Her stock included Jumeau dolls, Lehmann clockwork Ostriches and goo-goo dolls. Despite high turnover, Lucy Peck recorded profits of only ¬£2 per week. As well as making her own dolls, Lucy Peck employed other prestigious dollmakers, including Richard Montanari, whose parents had won medals at the 1851 Great Exhibition. By 1914, the shop had moved again to 81 Wigmore Street as a Dolls' Warehouse. After 1918, Peck established a Dolls' Hospital at 306 Earls Court Road. By this time, wax dolls were less popular (bisque dolls were more in demand), and so the demand had shifted from new production to restoration of old items. By 1922, Lucy Peck was retired, and lived in Wimbledon and then Kingston, where she took up clay modelling at Kingston School of Art. She died on October 20, 1930.

In her lifetime, she exhibited in Stills Gallery, Edinburgh; Mercury Gallery, London; The Corridor Gallery, Fife; Pearce Institute, Glasgow; and First of May Gallery, Edinburgh.  Early life and education  Franki Raffles was born in Salford on 17 October 1955. Her parents were Eric and Gillian Raffles (n√©e Posnansky). She had two older sisters, Sally and Emma, and a younger brother, Hugh. Her father managed the E Raffles and Co. textile factory, which had been established by her grandfather. In 1963 the family moved to London where Raffles was educated at Lady Eleanor Holles School. As a teenager she was active in Jewish Youth organisations and aged fifteen she joined a trip to the Soviet Union visiting Moscow and Leningrad. In the summer of 1973, after leaving school and before university, she spent several months in Israel working as a swimming pool lifeguard in Tel Aviv. In September 1973 Raffles took up a place at the University of St Andrews to study philosophy. During her time at St Andrews she was active in the Women's liberation movement and she held strong feminist views for the rest of her life. In 1976, she became the second student ever, and the first female student, to seek nomination for the Rectorship of the University - she was however unexpectedly disqualified for submitting her nomination seven minutes late. Her disqualification was upheld despite all other candidates offering to stand down in favour of a new deadline. She graduated MA (Hons) Moral Philosophy in 1977.  Career  In 1978, Raffles moved to the Isle of Lewis to renovate a derelict farmhouse in the village of Callanish. It was here that she began to experiment with photography.. In 1983 she moved to Edinburgh and began to find work as a self-employed photographer. She worked with community groups, charities and arts organisations, and taught evening classes. She arranged an exhibition of her early photographs entitled Lewis Women. She was awarded a Kodak Bursary and funding from Polaroid to develop and carry out an innovative educational photography project with children with special needs at Pinewood School ‚Äì We can take Pictures. In September 1983 she spent several weeks in Zimbabwe where, for the first time, she introduced an international perspective to her creative practice and photographed a local women's health project, an image from this project was later used in the Women's Press Diary. In June 1984, together with her daughter Anna and her partner, Sandy, Raffles set off to make the journey across the Soviet Union on the trans-Siberian railway to China. The two women spent over twelve months travelling and also visited Tibet, India, Hong Kong and the Philippines. Throughout this period she was taking many photographs, recording women's lives and work. On her return to Scotland she began to select work from her travels for future exhibition. Back in Edinburgh in the summer of 1985 Raffles returned to working as a self-employed photographer. She continued building a portfolio of educational, community-based, charity and campaign project work. In November 1985 she travelled to Mexico on a commission for The Mercury Gallery. In 1986 she carried out a project commissioned by Edinburgh District Council featuring the women athletes in the 13th Commonwealth Games held in Edinburgh. This resulted in an exhibition entitled Simply Women which toured community venues across the city. From then on she was attached to projects developed through Edinburgh District Council's Women's Committee and documented all aspects of the work of the Committee. In 1987/88 this included the booklet and touring exhibition To Let you Understand about women's lives and work across the city. In 1989 Raffles' work was included in The Stills Gallery Touring Exhibition Picturing Women. She also continued to plan international projects and spent time in Dominica and in the Soviet Union. In 1990 an exhibition of photographs taken in Russia, Georgia and the Ukraine, Women Workers, was shown in Glasgow and Rostov-on-Don, Russia. From 1991 Raffles worked, with Evelyn Gillan and a small team of other women, to establish the charity Zero Tolerance, to raise awareness of male violence against women. She was responsible for creating the images used in the early campaigns which were launched to great acclaim in Edinburgh and were then taken up by local authorities across the UK and abroad. At this time she was awarded funding as a Wingate Trust Scholar to undertake a documentary project, entitled Lot‚Äôs Wife, working with immigrant Jewish women, from the former Soviet Union, who had been resettled in Israel. She visited Israel a number of times to carry out this project which investigated ideas of family, identity, and religion. In the autumn of 1994 she was completing the selection of images and editing interviews she had carried out with the Russian Jewish women.  Death and Legacy  Raffles died on 6 December 1994 as a result of complications after giving birth to twin daughters. A retrospective exhibition of her work, Observing Women at Work, was held at the Glasgow School of Art from 4 March to 27 April 2017. The Franki Raffles Archive - including photographic prints, catalogues, negatives, contact sheets, notebooks and other materials - is held at the University of St Andrews Library.

The film stars Henry Cavill, Ben Kingsley, Alexandra Daddario, and Stanley Tucci, with Brendan Fletcher, Minka Kelly, and Nathan Fillion in supporting roles. It premiered at the LA Film Festival on September 28, 2018, originally titled as Nomis. It was later released on August 8, 2019 by DirecTV on video on demand and theatrically on September 6, 2019 by Saban Films. Plot When the body of a young woman is found on a lumber truck, Detective Walter Marshall suspects that the victim leapt to her death to escape from a captor. A breakthrough is inadvertently made in the case when former judge Michael Cooper's vigilante sting to capture a child predator results in his ward Lara being kidnapped. Through a tracker in Lara's earrings, Marshall finds her and other captive young women in a mansion owned by Simon Stulls, a seemingly-mentally disabled man. Simon is arrested and the police attempt to determine if he is responsible for the abductions. In investigating Simon's background, they discover that he was born from rape and his mother attempted suicide before giving birth to him. While Simon is in custody, the police force finds themselves being targeted by another attacker. Technician Matthew Quinn is killed in a car bombing and fellow technician Glasow is forced to free Simon when the life of his infant daughter is threatened. The police recapture Simon after he has killed his father, just as Cooper discovers that Lara is missing. Believing Simon to be responsible, Cooper ambushes his police transport when he is surprised by another man who looks exactly like Simon. It is then revealed that Simon is in fact a pair of identical twins, with one being behind the kidnappings and the other truly being mentally disabled. The twins kill Cooper and kidnap police profiler Rachel Chase before escaping. Using a tracker that Simon left in the police station, a team led by Marshall locates the twins by an icy lake where they are holding Rachel and Lara. Lara escapes and Marshall takes the mentally disabled brother hostage to convince the malevolent brother to release Rachel. After Rachel is freed, Marshall tells the mentally disabled twin to hug his brother. The mentally disabled twin complies, causing both brothers to fall through the ice and drown. Afterwards, Lara reads a letter from Cooper thanking her for all that she has done. Marshall visits his daughter Faye accompanied by Rachel, implying that Marshall and Rachel have entered into a relationship.

On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Moore of Movie Nation described the film as \\"cracked and incoherent\\" and criticized it for \\"[having] a lot of clutter, convoluted craziness and head-slappingly illogical turns in here, too\\", concluding that \\"whatever coherence the players saw on the screenplay page was lost in the trip from page to the shoot on set, and from the set to the editing bay\\".

It was published in the late 1700s; James Lyon (1776-1824) was the nominal owner and publisher, but the de facto owner and author of much of its content was Lyon's father Matthew Lyon. History In the early years of Vermont statehood, there were two newspapers in circulation: the Bennington Gazette and the Windsor Journal. Matthew Lyon was an early political, military, and business leader of Vermont. He founded the town of Fair Haven in 1783, and constructed and operated several businesses, including mills and forges. Having been trained as a printer and bookbinder, in 1793 Lyon decided to create a newspaper as way to communicate his ideas to the voters; he had been an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1791 and 1792, and intended to run again in 1794. Lyon established a newspaper in Fair Haven; though his son James, also a printer and publisher, was the nominal owner, much of the paper's management was overseen by Matthew Lyon, and he authored much of the content. In addition to Matthew Lyon's articles, other stories and columns were prepared by James Lyon and Alden Spooner (1757-1827). In 1794, James and Matthew Lyon sold the physical plant for the Fair Haven Gazette to Reverend Samuel Williams and Judge Samuel Williams of Rutland; they used these items to establish the Rutland Herald, a newspaper which has remained in circulation ever since. Legacy Matthew Lyon failed to win a U.S. House seat in 1794; he was finally elected on his fourth attempt in 1796. As a way to continue communicating his Democratic-Republican ideas to his constituents and oppose the ideas of the Federalists, Matthew Lyon and James Lyon started a new paper, The Scourge Of Aristocracy and Repository of Important Political Truth. In 1798, Matthew Lyon was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, based on anti-Adams administration comments he had made in the Scourge, and a letter to Alden Spooner; Spooner was now publisher of the Vermont Journal, and the letter appeared in his paper. Lyon was held in prison in Vergennes, Vermont; he won reelection to Congress in 1798 while he was incarcerated. Lyon's prison term expired on February 9, 1799; he could not pay the fine which was part of his sentence, or the costs associated with his imprisonment. Political supporters raised the necessary funds, enabling him to be released and take up his seat in the House. After failing to win reelection in 1800, Lyon moved to Kentucky, where he was involved in several business ventures and was again elected to Congress.

She toured with the Robert Shaw Chorale from 1950 to 1953, when she continued her studies in Stuttgart. Her teachers included Res Fischer and Ellinor Junker-Giesen. She appeared first in concert, especially in alto-parts of oratorios. In 1956 she joined the ensemble of the W√ºrttembergische Staatsoper, where she remained for 14 years. She studied a broad repertory, from Baroque to contemporary music, playing as both comic and tragic characters. She appeared as a guest artist, first in 1959 when the Stuttgart Opera performed Wagner's Parsifal at the Vienna State Opera. She was engaged there for Handel's Jephtha, with Fritz Wunderlich, and for Jan√°ƒçek's Jen≈Øfa. In 1961, she appeared at the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo as Annina in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss, which became one of her signature roles. From 1962 she was invited to international festivals.

Built about 1899, it provided power to the surrounding estate of the Scoville family, owners of local iron mining and processing operations. It was converted into a privated residence in the 1950s, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 for its distinctive architecture. Description and history The former Scoville Powerhouse is located in a rural-residential cluster in northeastern Salisbury, at the northwest corner of Twin Lakes Road and Beaver Dam Road. It is set on the south bank of Schenob Brook, near the outlet of the Twin Lakes. It is 1-1/2 stories in height, built out of stone, brick, and concrete and covered by a steeply pitched hip roof. The front facade faces east toward Taconic Road, and is dominated by two steep gables, each rising above now-glassed openings that resemble the openings for carriages in carriage houses. The gable edges are decorated with Gothic style bargeboard. The building has rustic stone corner quoins. The water that powered the building's turbine (still in situ but now bypassed and not operation) was provided via a penstock that runs under Taconic Road just south of the dam (which the road crosses over). and This site on Schenob Brook was first used for power generation in the 18th century, powering a forge and gristmill c. 1748. Land in this area was acquired by Herbert and Robert Scoville in 1899. The Scovilles were by then important political and business leaders in the community, owning one of the local iron works. The developed this area as a country estate, building a large stone country manor (destroyed by fire), a carriage house (across Schenob Brook, also converted to a residence), and the powerhouse, which provided electricity to the estate. Family records are unclear on how long the power station operated, but the estate was sold off in portions in the mid-20th century. The power station was sold in the 1950s and converted into a residence.

Born in Islington, Challener's parents died when he was young, and he was brought up by a relative who worked for the Great Northern Railway. In time, he moved with his relative to Doncaster, and there began working for the railway company as a clerk. He was an early member of the National Association of Railway Clerks (RCA), being a founder member of its Doncaster branch, later in 1897.Adrian Tranter, \\"Challener, John Ernest Stopford\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.55-57 Challener devoted much of his time to the union, attending each of its conferences, and in May 1899 taking the lead on a national campaign to increase clerks' salaries. The union's general secretary, John Hereford, resigned late in 1898 due to poor health, and Challener was the only candidate to replace him, being declared elected at the union's conference in June 1899. From 1900, he also served as the union's treasurer, and from 1902 he became the union's first full-time member of staff. As leader, Challener decided to bring the RCA into the mainstream British trade union movement; he registered it as a trade union in 1900, and arranged for it to affiliate to the Trades Union Congress in 1903. As a result, he was able to increase membership from 537, to 4,500, by 1906. Challener was also politically active. He was the founding secretary of the Doncaster Labour Representation Committee (LRC), although he decided against advocating that the RCA affiliate to the national LRC. He stood for Doncaster Council in 1903 and 1904, although he was not elected, and he was also prominent on Doncaster Trades Council. By 1905, issues with the RCA's finances had emerged. The union's 1905 conference supported a motion criticising Challener for financial mismanagement, although it also supported a motion of confidence in his overall leadership. However, further investigation revealed that the financial issues were due to theft rather than incompetence - he was ultimately revealed to have stolen ¬£380. His mental health declined, and he travelled to Paris in 1906, where he shot himself.

She is known for her geological work assisting husband Edward Greenly in his surveying of Scotland and Anglesey, as well as being an accomplished artist and animal rights' representative. She died of heart failure on 1 March 1927, at the age of 75. The \\"Annie Greenly Fund\\" for detailed geological mapping was established in her honour by the Geological Society of London. Personal life Much of what we know about Annie Greenly comes from the autobiographic work of her husband. Greenly grew up in Bath and Bristol in a liberal evangelical household. Her first introduction to geology came at age 11 when she witnessed an earthquake on 6 October 1863. She first met her future husband Edward Greenly in 1875 in Bristol. Their families were acquainted and encouraged the growing friendship between the two, which was built on philosophical and poetic exchanges as well as Edward's scientific studies. Greenly often helped the then chemistry student with experiments in his home laboratory. When pressed by Edward's parents to either become engaged or break off the relationship, they separated and lost all contact for 11 years. Edward approached her again in 1890, and they soon got engaged and married in 26 September 1891. The couple had no children. Greenly was blind in one eye from an early age. Due to worries for his wife's health Edward Greenly retired from the Geological Survey in 1895, and the couple subsequently moved to Anglesey where they continued their geological surveying and mapping relying on a private income. Despite her obvious interest in geology she stressed herself: \\"I am not a scholar\\". On top of her scientific role, Annie Greenly was a contralto singer and pianist, and a long-standing member of her local branch of the North Wales RSPCA. Edward Greenly (and with him Annie to a lesser extent) was a mystic who shifted from Evangelicalism to pantheistic religion and Buddhism. He strongly believed to be reunited with his wife, who he survived by almost a quarter of a century, in an afterlife. Geological career Greenly became fully involved in her husband's geological work immediately after their wedding. \\"We have agreed that I am not to be ignorant of your subject‚Ä¶ I can begin by reading. Put into our luggage some lucid elementary books.\\" Subsequently, She worked as Edward's field assistant who was working for the Scottish Geological Survey before retiring to Anglesey. She took control of logistics, arranging lodgings and facilities, prepared powdered mineral specimens, and extensively proof-read and edited his writing. Edward reflects on her value as assistant in one aspect in particular: \\"More than one geologist [‚Ä¶] has been killed while examining railway cuttings. When the author was examining cuttings in Anglesey, Annie Greenly always came with him as train-watcher and with her at the top of the bank he was able to concentrate on the geology.\\" More than providing logistical and moral support, however, Greenly revolutionised her husband's surveying technique early on. She encouraged him to follow the exemplary lead of his colleague Charles Clough‚Äôs in all but one respect:, stating, \\"Let Clough be your model in precision, but do not follow him in style. Found your style on nature‚Äôs curves. Watch these wherever you can and where you cannot see them, feel them. To be true, a map must be beautiful.\\" Edward claimed that his wife was \\"the initial source of [his] inspiration\\". Thus her sense of clarity and beauty was critical in developing her husband's style of mapping, including the green line method for which Edward Greenly is famous until today. A thin green line is placed on the map around all rock exposure highlighting the data that the geological interpretation of the map is based on. In particular, Annie was instrumental for Greenly's map of Anglesey. She takes particular credit for the index to the Anglesey memoir which is now held in the National Museum of Wales. Edward Greenly documents her continuous support: \\"some sheets she pronounced to be hopeless and these [‚Ä¶] she rewrote altogether‚Ä¶we worked on opposite sides of the table, I writing, she doctoring.\\" She was highly valued for her persistence and logic. Greenly was meticulous in the reading and editing of her husband's manuscripts, finishing a final piece of work only a week before her death. Together with her husband, Greenly regularly attended the annual meetings of the Geological Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and other conferences and meetings. In 1903, she instigated the first ever female participation in the conference dinner, which extended to other female geologists such as Gertrude Elles and Lady Teall.

Life Boissevain was the youngest of nine children. Her father was a shipowner from a rich Huguenot merchant family and her mother was the daughter of a lawyer. Education Boissevain attended a high school for girls. After graduating, Boissevain attended a lecture on botany by Hugo de Vries, which sparked her interest in the subject. In 1896, she started studying natural science at the University of Amsterdam. Here she specialised in zoology. After graduating, she moved to Zurich to do further research on the Dentalium species and at age 25 attained the title of doctor. Afterwards, she moved back to the Netherlands where she became a curator for Artis, a Dutch zoo and association for zoology. She would remain active as a researcher until 1915, but would retain her interest in zoology afterwards. Four mollusk taxa are named after her: the species Cadulus boissevaini, Antalis boissevainae, Fustiaria Mariae and the genus Boissevainia. Women's rights While in Zurich, Boissevain encountered international students who were interested in women's rights. When she returned to the Netherlands, she visited Aletta Jacobs to talk about the Dutch women's rights movement.Boissevain in 1001 Vrouwen In 1908, Jacobs asked Boissevain to help with the preparation for the third International Congress of Women in Amsterdam. Here, she met other prominent feminists and would go on to become more involved in the women's movement. Together with Rosa Manus, who she had gone to school with, she founded a commission for propaganda within the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht and was its president until 1912. The same year, she and Manus proposed an exhibition that would highlight the circumstances of women between 1813 and 1913, inspired by the exhibitions held to celebrate 100 years of independence from the French. She wrote the catalog for the exhibition De Vrouw 1813-1913, which became successful.Catalog on worldcat During the First World War, Boissevain helped the families of mobilised soldiers and Flemish refugees. In 1915, she was one of the organisers of the International Congress of Women in the Hague. In the same year, she also wrote a book about her life titled Een Amsterdamsche familie, which was published in 1967. After 1915, Boissevain moved to Great Britain and adopted two English girls. She lived in Switzerland with her two daughters from around 1925 to 1928, moved to the Netherlands afterwards and lived in London from 1930 until her death in 1959. She is buried in Amsterdam.

It is still in existence today. The house, called \\"Garinish Lodge\\", was burned in September 1922 during the Irish Civil War (1922‚Äì1923), but later rebuilt.

Retrieved 9 March 2017 Life Chambers received her DPhil in political theory from the University of Oxford, and she subsequently taught at the University of Oxford and the London School of Economics, before moving to the University of Cambridge. She has published on feminism, liberalism, and social construction. Philosophical work In her 2008 book Sex, Culture, and Justice: the Limits of Free Choice, Chambers is concerned about what the state's response should be to cultural practices which individuals freely choose to partake in as a way of securing certain goods, when those practices impose disproportionate costs on vulnerable members of the community. She defends three main claims. First, individual preferences to pursue certain activities are shaped by social construction: if individuals are raised to follow certain practices which are deemed choiceworthy in their community, then they will be more disposed to follow these practices later in life. Second, if social construction brings individuals to form preferences for activities that are self-degrading or self-harmful, the individuals in question are victims of an unjust process of social construction. Third, the state is permitted to prohibit self-degrading or self-harmful activities that individuals freely choose to follow when their preference for following these activities was shaped by an unjust process of social construction; this is because preferences formed by an unjust process of social construction are morally suspect, and the state has a greater obligation to free individuals from pernicious practices that harm and degrade them than to satisfy morally suspect preferences. According to Marion Smiley, Chambers' use of the notion of an unjust process social construction \\"to justify, as well as to limit, prohibition, provides us with a whole new and productive way of using the state to promote gender equality,\\" and she argues that a particular virtue of Chambers' work is that it \\"makes clear why we do not have to choose between gender equality and autonomy in our efforts to prevent harm in the lives of women and all others.\\" In her 2017 book Against Marriage: An Egalitarian Defense of the Marriage-Free State she argues that marriage violates both equality and liberty so should not be recognised by the state, nor have any legal status. This built on her earlier paper 'The marriage-free state' which makes the case for abolishing state-recognized marriage and replacing it with piecemeal regulation of personal relationships.

Her father Thomas was a master plasterer, her mother was named Sarah, and Norah had a brother called Leonard. Norah had a good education and excelled in botany and art. Norah Wellings started working at Chad Valley Co Ltd in 1919. In 1926, she established Victoria Toy Works in Wellington, Shropshire, England. The factory had six employees, including some family members. As well as her own brand dolls, Wellings continued to make Chad Valley dolls in similar style. Wellings' dolls are often made of cloth (felt, velvet and velveteen), and represent children and adults, as well as storybook characters. The manufacturing process involved moulding buckram over a layer of plastic wood, overlaid with steamed felt. The faces were then handpainted on, with a waterproof coating to make them washable. Wellings exhibited at the British Industries Fairs in 1927 and 1929. She was listed as a 'Manufacturer of Soft Fabric Toys of Distinction' and the range included dolls, plush novelties, and mascots. During World War Two, Wellings made dolls representing characters from the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, including Harry the Hawk, which was sold to raise money for the Royal Air Force Comforts Fund. She also made a number of 'Jolly Boy' felt sailor figures, which were sold as souvenirs aboard cruise liners. In 1959, some months after the death of her brother, Leonard, Wellings closed the business, destroyed her designs, tools and unfinished dolls, and retired.

Following his Matura graduation in economics at the Gymnasium of Liestal, he studied economics at the renowned University of St. Gallen. He graduated summa cum laude with a degree in economics (lic. oec. HSG) in 1986. After his studies, he gained his first professional experiences at the American investment banks Merrill Lynch and Salomon Brothers and quickly rose in the ranks. At Salomon Brothers, he initiated the opening of new trading departments in Z√ºrich and Frankfurt. Despite excellent career prospects, he left the firm in 1992 and founded his own hedge fund ‚Äì the RMF Investment Group - along with two partners in Zug. = RMF Investment Group = The investment thesis of hedge funds, i.e. achieving above average returns compared to the reference market and reducing risk through hedging strategies, was widely unknown in Switzerland at the time and was met by scepticism among investors. RMF achieved ground-breaking results. At the beginning, banks and insurance companies in Switzerland did not see the potential in this type of fund, which aimed to also make gains in sideways or negative trending markets. As such, RMF started trading on Japanese warrants and convertible bonds. It was one of the first active hedge fund groups in Europe. RMF‚Äôs investment thesis proved successful, despite difficult periods such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Following these dry spell periods, institutional investors started accepting these concepts. A successful collaboration with LGT Group and Swiss Life (then Schweizerische Lebensversicherungs- und Rentenanstalt) started in 1996 with the launch of Castle Alternative Invest, a hedge fund investment company.

A bronze cast of her 1903 bust of the writer Herman Bang was installed on Sankt Ann√¶ Plads in Copenhagen in 2012. Early life Born in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen on 18 June 1872, Plockross Irminger was the daughter of the merchant Johannes Frederik Plockross (1821‚Äì96) and Cathrine Frederikke Tietgen (1833‚Äì91). After showing interest in modelling from an early age, she began her studies under the sculptor Aksel Hansen before attending the art school run by Emilie Mundt and Marie Luplau. In February 1893 Plockross Irminger was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where she studied sculpture under August Saabye until 1899 when she worked for a number of years in Vilhelm Bissen's studio. In 1908, she married the painter Valdemar Irminger. Career as a sculptor Irminger first exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1897 with En Sp√¶d, a bronze relief. She continued to exhibit there until 1952, especially from 1904 to 1925. She also occasionally exhibited at the Kvindelige Kunstneres Samfund (Female Artists' Society) from 1920 to 1961. Her work was presented at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, at the 1914 Baltic Exhibition in Malm√∂ and at the 1927 Danish National Exhibition in Brooklyn. Thanks to grants from the Academy, she went on study trips to Paris, Germany and Italy. Under Bissen's guidance, Irminger developed her own style bordering on Naturalism. Among her principal creations are Drengen og Pinfsvinet (The Boy and the Hedgehog, 1899 and bronze 1911), Yngling (Youth, marble, 1909), awarded the Academy's medal of the year, and Ung Pige (marble, 1907) which is reminiscent of Ludvig Brandstrup. She also created portraits of J.F. Willumsen (relief, 1900), Herman Bang (bronze, 1904) and Ludvig Brandstrup (1922). She also created two fine bronzes of her husband in 1912 and 1919, characterized by a still, rather introvert look. Also of interest are the decorative funeral urns and the figurines she designed while at Bing & Gr√∏ndahl's from 1898 to 1925. Of special note are her Moder og Barn (Mother and Child, 1902), L√¶sende B√∏rn (Children Reading, 1903), and Ung Pige med Kat (Young Girl with Cat, 1911). The figures became very popular. Many were acquired by museums in Berlin and Dresden. They are still produced today, faithfully reproduced from Irminger's original designs.

Born in Derby, Peet became a fitter in the railway works, and joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers (ASE). He soon moved to Manchester, where he worked at the Gorton Railway Works, and for the first time became active in the union, winning election as branch secretary.Edmund Frow, Ruth Frow and John Saville, \\"Peet, George\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.170-173 Peet became a socialist, joining the Openshaw Socialist Society, and developed an interest in syndicalism, representing Gorton at a national conference on the matter in 1910. Around the start of World War I, he joined the British Socialist Party (BSP), alongside Harry Pollitt. Increasingly prominent in his trade union work, in 1916 he came eighth out of twenty-two candidates for the assistant general secretaryship of the ASE. Inspired by the Clyde Workers' Committee, Peet worked with William McLaine to form the Manchester Workers' Committee, in April 1916. Initially, it attracted little interest, but in September a decision to increase the wages of hourly paid engineering workers but not those of piece workers led to a strike, which the committee supported. Although the strike was soon over, the dispute was not settled for a further three months, and the strike committee then agreed to merge with the Workers' Committee, forming the Joint Engineering Shop Stewards' Committee, with Peet as secretary. The Shop Stewards' Committee played a prominent role in subsequent disputes around exemptions of trained engineers from military service and compelling engineers to work on non-munition work. While the ASE supported local action on these issues, the Committee organised a ballot on solidarity action. This was won, and led to a major two-week strike which spread around the country, ultimately involving 200,000 engineering workers. Peet travelled the country supporting the strike, until he and Arthur MacManus were arrested in London. They and their colleagues then agreed to sign an agreement between the ASE and the Ministry of Munitions which settled the strike and, as a result, Peet and MacManus were released. In August 1917, Peet was an organiser of a national conference of shop stewards' organisations. This formed the permanent Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committees, of which Peet served as secretary, alongside MacManus as chair, and J. T. Murphy as assistant secretary. Two months later, it merged with a movement for the amalgamation of engineering unions, which had been founded in 1915 but had achieved little during the war. The organisation supported the October Revolution, and Peet became its representative to the Hands Off Russia movement. It hoped to affiliate to the Third International; this was not permitted, as it was not a political party, but it joined the Red International of Labour Unions, Peet and Ted Lismer becoming joint secretaries of its British Bureau. The Shop Stewards' Committee became part of the National Workers' Committee in 1921, and Peet was prominent in its calls for a general strike on Black Friday. This was unsuccessful, and Peet was arrested, jailed for a month, and fined ¬£100. The National Workers' Committee in turn merged with the British Bureau in 1922, Peet remaining joint secretary for a year, after which the Comintern ordered that Willie Gallacher and J. R. Campbell replace him and Lismer. In 1920, the BSP became part of the new Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and Peet served on its Manchester District Committee. However, his replacement as secretary of the British Bureau appears to have shaken his support for the party; he resigned from the CPGB some time after 1923, and did not undertake any further political activity. Peet remained active in the ASE, and was one of its delegates to the Trades Union Congress in 1918. He also served as a tutor for the Manchester Labour College. The ASE became the Amalgamated Engineering Union, and Peet devoted himself to the branch, and was still branch treasurer when he died, in 1967.

His uncanny genius at setting up artillery parks gave Frederick the Great high confidence in the artillery's ability to effect the outcome. During the Seven Years' War, Moller gained great fame specifically for his actions at Lobositz, Rossbach and Zorndorf. Military service Moller, born in 1690, joined the Prussian military on 26 January 1720 as a cannoneer in the artillery corps, of which his father was the regimental quartermaster. On 1 April 1729, he was promoted to second lieutenant and on 31 August 1733, to first lieutenant. In 1737, he was dispatched to the Austrian army, to fight in the war against the Ottoman Empire. On 19 November 1741 he returned to the Prussian army, and was promoted to staff captain; in January 1742, he was promoted to captain and on 20 April 1755 to major.Bernhard von Poten, Moller, Karl Friedrich von, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, edited by the Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften [Historical Commission at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences], Volume 22 (1885), pp. 127‚Äì128, digital full text available at Wikisource (version of 8 March 2017, 15:13 UTC) =Battle of Lobositz= The Battle of Lobositz, fought on 1 October 1756, was the first major battle of the Seven Years' War; the artillery played a significant role. The guns started firing at about 6:00 am, but it was occasional fire: after 7:00 am, the artillery put forth a sustained and effective effort.Herbert J. Redman, Frederick the Great and the Seven Years' War, 1756-1763, McFarland, 2015, p.15. Although the Austrians held the higher ground as far as the infantry and cavalry were concerned, and the artillery thundered from the heights above the Prussian line so long and so loudly that even seasoned veterans became unnerved: some of the Croats in Maximilian Ulysses Reichsgraf von Browne's army fled to the rear of the field and even Browne himself, a life-long veteran, admitted to never hearing anything like it.Redman, p 17. From 1:00 pm onward, the Prussian howitzers pounded against the Austrian force so effectively the artillery used its ammunition at a rapid rate. The battle was not an unqualified success, although the Austrians abandoned the field which, in the 18th century, was tantamount to admitting defeat.Redman, p. 22. Moller was promoted to lieutenant colonel the day after the battle, 2 October 1756, and received the Order Pour le M√©rite. Frederick wrote to Field Marshal Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin: \\"Moller has done miracles and secunded me in an astonishing manner.\\" =Battle of Rossbach= At the Battle of Rossbach, the center of action occurred around Moller's battery of 16 heavy guns and two howitzers on the Janush√ºgel. Prince Henry's center, composed of infantry, had marched behind the Janus hill, and was supported by Seydlitz's seven regiments of horse. At about 3:00 pm, on the signal from Seydlitz himself, Moller's artillery opened fire on the Allied troops and tore huge gaps in their lines. The artillery first destroyed any semblance of order among the Allied cavalry, and then raked the infantry. The artillery fire was so thorough the concussion of the bombardment could be felt several miles away. Soubise and his staff thought the Prussians were retreating, and using the guns as cover, and simply hurried to get out of range, but this further disorganized the Allied lines, and caused unit cohesion to break down. Consequently, at 3:30 pm, when Seydlitz's squadrons descended on the Allied army, they wrought havoc among the infantry and cavalry who had remained in columns; those who escaped the artillery and the horsemen ran headlong into Prince Henry's infantry. Again, artillery fire came into focus: Moller's battery on the Janus had been reinforced with three siege guns from Leipzig, and these huge guns battered the Austrians again. Rossbach proved that the column as a means of tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of Moller's fire; the greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.Redman, pp. 130-136. =Battle of Zorndorf= Moller also was present at Prague, Olomouc and Zorndorf. There, at Zorndorf, Moller's artillery was a key to the battle plan. Frederick's plan of attack was first to hammer the Russian right with heavy artillery fire and then to launch Heinrich von Manteuffel's advanced guard against it. Expecting cavalry, the Russians formed in a square, the best way to receive an mounted attack but the worst way to receive an artillery barrage. Moller opened fire with 60 total of his 18- and 24-pounders, placed in two locations around Zorndorf; the initial range was too far, so they closed about 600 paces, and then ripped the Russian squares apart. Russian sources reported that one particular cannon shot killed or wounded 48 grenadiers. Despite this accuracy, Moller's contribution at Zorndorf could not be measured in a single stroke, but in his ability to move his horse artillery around the battlefield. At 1:00 pm, they were in one place, firing canister into tightly-packed Russian formations; at 4:00 pm, they were another place, pounding the Russian line; at 7:00, they were elsewhere, preventing a Russian counter-attack.Redman, pp 210-217. =Last days= Frederick held Moller in high regard. Moller once told the King, \\"Your Majesty, all will be well, my genius will tell me\\", and the outcome had justified his confidence; Frederick frequently asked him in times of trouble, \\"what [did] his genius tell him\\". Moller died in Freiberg, Saxony, on 9 November 1762. Of the military men whose names are listed on the Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great, Moller is one of only three who did not achieve the rank of general.Denkmal K√∂nig Friedrichs des Gro√üen: Enth√ºllt am 31.

It belongs to the class of Mollicutes which includes bacteria featuring reduced genome sizes that may be parasitic or commensal. It is a gram positive bacterium, however its cells lack a peptidoglycan layer. M. mobile cells are covered with membrane- anchored proteins, including surface proteins responsible for adhesion, or attachment to objects and surfaces, and antigenic variation, a mechanism which enables surface proteins to elude host immune responses. M. mobile survival is dependent upon surface proteins which allow it to bind and infect host cells, vary its own surface proteins in order to escape the host immune system, and transport nutrients and ions.  Structure  The M. mobile cell is divided into three parts: the head, neck, and body. The proteins involved in gliding and adhesion, named Gli123, Gli349, and Gli521, are found at the neck. On the surface of M. mobile lies variable surface proteins (Mvsps) made up of 11 genes including mvspA and mvspP. These proteins are considered to be involved in the parasitism of M. mobile. The lack of a peptidoglycan layer within M. mobile creates a flexible cell wall, enabling the bacterium to form a protrusion and glide in a smooth manner. As a result of this cell wall structure, M. mobile is the fastest moving mycoplasma species recorded.  Gliding direction M. mobile moves in a gliding manner along a curved path in the direction of the cell protrusion, otherwise known as the cell pole. The protrusion of the cell, which extends from the cell membrane and consists of hundreds of miniature legs which attach to distant cells, pulls the M. mobile. The gliding machinery, consisting of a large structure of surface proteins, forms at the protrusion. The legs, which are approximately 50-nm long, are protein molecules on the cell surface that aid the cell's motility. This process enables M. mobile to move and releases sialylated oligosaccharides (carbohydrates that have reacted with sialic acid) onto the surface of the object in which the cell attaches to. The proteins on the surface of M. mobile then pull the sialylated oligosaccharides on the foreign cell surface through the use of energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis. Through the use of this action M. mobile is recorded to move 2.0 to 4.5 Œºm per second on solid surfaces. At this speed, the M. mobile is moving 3 to 7 times the length of the cell per second.

Life Sibyl was called the \\"nepta\\" (either \\"niece\\" or \\"kinswoman\\") of King Henry. The term \\"niece\\" was often used to mean that the person was an illegitimate child rather than a niece, so it is possible that she was really Henry's bastard daughter.Given-Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards p. 71 The historian Frank Barlow also implies that she could have been Henry's daughter rather than his niece.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 236 Against this, Kathleen Thompson argues that Henry was not shy about recognizing his bastards, and that it is more likely that Sibyl was the daughter of Henry's elder brother Robert Curthose. Robert was Duke of Normandy from 1086 (although he pawned it in 1096 to another brother, William Rufus, to finance going on the First Crusade),Clanchy England and Its Rulers p. 46 and Falaise was where Robert's legitimate son, William Clito, was being raised.Thompson \\"Affairs of State\\" Journal of Medieval History pp. 150‚Äì151 Katharine Keats-Rohan argues instead that Sibyl was the younger daughter of William de Falaise and Geva de Burcy. William de Falaise was the lord of Stogursey in Somerset.Sanders English Baronies p. 22 footnote 7 Keats-Rohan says that Sibyl was just a \\"kinswoman\\" of Henry's and not a bastard of either Henry or Robert. I. J. Sanders does not believe Sibyl was William's daughter, but does not speculate further on her ancestry. If Sibyl was a bastard, nothing is known of her mother.Given Wilson and Curteis Royal Bastards p. 63 Thompson speculates that if Sibyl was the daughter of Robert, Sibyl's mother may have been someone employed in raising William Clito and that Sibyl was named for Robert's deceased wife, Sibyl of Conversano. Sibyl married Baldwin de Boullers (sometimes spelled Bullers), at the instigation of Henry I. Baldwin had at least two sons ‚Äì Stephen and Baldwin ‚Äì and two daughters ‚Äì Matilda (or Maud) and Hillaria. Matilda married Richard fitzUrse.

She is believed to be the model for several of Lippi's Madonnas.  Life  Madonna and Child, Filippo Lippi, c.1450-1465, Uffizi Gallery, Florence, believed to be a portrait of Lucrezia Buti. Lucrezia was born in Florence in 1435, the daughter of Francesco Buti and Caterina Ciacchi. She became a nun in the Dominican monastery of Santa Margherita in Prato. According to Vasari, while a novice or boarder at the monastery, she met the painter Fra Filippo Lippi who in 1456 had been commissioned to paint a picture for the nuns' high altar. Lippi requested Buti as a model for the Virgin in the painting he was creating for them. Lippi fell in love with Buti during her sittings for the painting and caused a great scandal by kidnapping her from a procession of the Girdle of Thomas in Prato and took her to his nearby home. Despite attempts to force her to return to the monastery, Buti remained at Lippi's house at the piazza del Duomo. In 1457, Buti bore Lippi a son, Filippino, and in 1465 a daughter, Alessandra. Through the intervention of Cosimo de' Medici, the couple received a dispensation to marry from Pius II, but according to Vasari, Lippi declined to marry Buti.

Born in Dulwich, Skinner began working for the Post Office, firstly delivering telegraphs, then as a postman, and as a sorter. He became active in the Independent Labour Party (ILP), probably under the influence of his wife, Phillis Emerson, who also convinced him to become a vegetarian and free thinker.John Saville, \\"Skinner, (James) Allen\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.5, pp.198-200 Skinner opposed World War I as a socialist and a pacifist. He was a conscientious objector, but also refused to take up alternative employment, and so was imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs in 1916. The prison authorities refused to provide vegetarian food, so Skinner suffered greatly from hunger. Although he was released three months later, he again refused military service, and was imprisoned a second time. While imprisoned, he contracted tuberculosis, which left him with a permanent disability affecting his knee and elbow. In 1919, Skinner found work with the Union of Post Office Workers (UPW), and relocated to Manchester in 1920 as the union moved its head office there. He soon became assistant editor of the union's journal, The Post, and wrote numerous articles for it. He moved back to London a few years later, continuing to work for the union, but became increasingly prominent in the ILP. He stood as the Labour Party candidate for Hendon at the 1924 United Kingdom general election, and for Clapham in 1929, and also served as secretary of the ILP's London and Southern Counties division. He supported the ILP's disaffiliation from the Labour Party in 1931 and remained active in the smaller party. During World War II, Skinner served as an adviser to the Central Board for Conscientious Objectors, and after the war, he was secretary of the No Conscription Council and chair of the board of Peace News. He retired from the UPW in 1950, and devoted more time to Peace News, including a period as editor from 1952 to 1955. During this period, he worked closely with A. J. Muste and the two were leading members of the \\"Third Way Movement\\". He was also involved in anti-nuclear campaigning, becoming a sponsor of the Emergency Committee for Direct Action against Nuclear War and was active in the Direct Action Committee. For demonstrating at a rocket base in Harrington, he was sentenced to two months in prison, spending his seventieth birthday there.

Life Italia Conti was born in London in 1873, the daughter of Luigi Conti, an opera singer and member of Garibaldi's Mille expedition. His wife, Italia's mother was Emily Mary Castle (1843‚Äì1914). The family moved to Brighton. Luigi Conti died in 1917 in Brookwood Asylum. Italia was educated in Haywards Heath and at Kensington Academy. Conti wrote to Ellen Terry, who arranged acting lessons for her. Her debut as an actress was a small part in The Last Word at the Lyceum Theatre, London. Conti helped to train a young Gertrude Lawrence without charge (Gertrude's family was unable to pay) and get a start in theatre. In 1908, Gertrude Lawrence's mother, Alice was working for extra money in the chorus of the Christmas pantomime at Brixton Theatre, when she heard about Conti, now 35, who was teaching dance, elocution and the rudiments of acting. Gertrude auditioned for Conti, who decided the 10 year old Gertrude was talented enough to warrant free lessons. Lawrence later joined Where the Rainbow Ends,\\"Foreword\\" by Italia Conti in the Where the Rainbow Ends', 18th ed. on which Conti was working. Conti's training also would lead to Lawrence's appearance in Max Reinhardt's The Miracle staged in London and Fifinella, directed by Basil Dean, for the Liverpool Repertory Theatre (now the Liverpool Playhouse). Charles Hawtrey had asked Italia Conti to train the children to act in Where the Rainbow Ends. Doing this led to Conti's founding of her drama school, the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. In 1925 the academy moved to Lamb's Conduit Street. Bombing in May 1940 destroyed the building, and Conti faced a serious financial loss. The school would be revived, however, at the Tavistock Little Theatre in Bloomsbury. Conti's pupil Gertrude Lawrence went on to be a great star of the theatre. Italia Conti died at Evelyn Cottage, Southbourne, Bournemouth, on 8 February 1946. Her school survived into the 21st century, and is in operation as of March 2020.

While based in Malaysia, Shakir served as an al-Qaeda ‚Äúfixer‚Äù and provided logistical support in the planning of the attacks on the USS Cole, the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and other terrorist attacks. Shakir was arrested in Qatar days after the 9/11 attacks, but was subsequently released and ultimately returned to Iraq.  History  In 1999, Shakir began working as a VIP greeter for Malaysian Airlines, a position he obtained with the help of a contact at the Iraqi embassy, as reported by The Weekly Standard. On January 5, 2000, Shakir escorted September 11 hijacker Khalid al Mihdhar to a waiting car and joined him for al-Qaeda planning meetings in Kuala Lumpur, later named the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. After the meetings, Shakir reported to work at the airport twice before disappearing. Six days after the 9/11 attacks, on September 17, 2001, Qatari authorities searched his person and apartment and arrested Shakir. During the search, authorities found contact information for multiple senior-level al-Qaeda members tied to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Operation Bojinka, the 1998 United States embassy bombings, and the attack on USS. Cole both on his body and in his apartment. Shakir's contacts included the brother of 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. American officials were reportedly aware that Shakir was acting an associate of two 9/11 hijackers who attended the January 2000 meeting in Malaysia and FBI officials were ‚Äúeager to interview Shakir.‚Äù However, Qatari authorities released Shakir, allowing him to flee the country. Shakir was detained in Amman, Jordan en route to Iraq on October 21, 2001, and was held in Jordan for three months before being allowed to return to Iraq.  Confusion over names  In 2004, allegations emerged that Shakir, as a senior-ranking al-Qaeda member, was an officer in Saddam Hussein's private militia. Iraqi military documents named Lt. Col. Hikmat Shakir Ahmad as a member of Fedayeen Saddam. The Weekly Standard published an article which speculated that the al-Qaeda member was a member of Saddam Hussein's militia. However, a 2004 article in the Washington Post quoted a senior Bush administration official who believed that names indicated two different individuals. The 9/11 Commission Report claimed that despite the confusion over Shakir's identity, the al-Qaeda member was still in police custody in Qatar when the Iraqi Fedayeen colonel with a similar name was in Iraq.

She was WCA's first and longest- serving secretary. She campaigned on various social issues and was active in the Quaker relief work for European refugees (Society of Friends); the Barns School for delinquent city boys and the Edinburgh Old People's Welfare Council.  Early life  Agnes Syme Macdonald was born on 8 September 1882 at 23 Dublin Street, Edinburgh. She was the only daughter of Euphemia Henderson (born in Kinross) and Alexander Macdonald (born in Kiltarlity, Inverness). Agnes was the fifth of six children. Alexander Macdonald was a wine and spirit merchant in Edinburgh and Euphemia, took over the business in 1893.  Political career  Agnes joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and says about this choice: ‚ÄòPossibly it's because I was a so-called ‚Äúlady of leisure‚Äù ‚Ä¶ At that time there were too many women running around with no training to do anything‚Äô. She was among the Scottish women who travelled to London to take part in the protests in early March 1912 after the government announced that no further time would be given to the Conciliation Bill, which would have introduced a measure of women's suffrage. Agnes broke a police office window with a hammer and was charged with malicious damage on 5 March 1912 and given two months' hard labour. In 1913 Agnes served as the secretary of the Edinburgh branch of the WSPU. However, she became alienated by the militant suffrage campaigns and helped set up the Edinburgh Women Citizens' Association (WCA) in 1918. Such Women's citizens' associations were formed throughout Britain to politically organize women and to promote women's representation. The Edinburgh association was inaugurated in Edinburgh city chambers on 9 May 1918.

As an artist, he created Realist acrylic paintings and watercolors of urban and suburban scenes, predominantly in the Washington, D.C., area, where he lived and exhibited.  Biography  Val Lewton was born May 23, 1937, in Santa Monica, California. His father, also named Val Lewton, produced a string of successful and influential B movies for RKO Pictures, including Cat People (1942) and I Walked with a Zombie (1943). His mother, Ruth Knapp, was a painter and teacher of autistic children. He graduated from Whitman College (1959) in Walla Walla, Washington, and earned a Master of Fine Arts from Claremont University (1962). After moving to Washington, D.C., he served on the staff of the Smithsonian American Art Museum for 32 years, while maintaining a career as a painter in his own right. Lewton died in 2015 from metastatic melanoma. Soon afterwards, exhibitions of his paintings were planned for the Katzen Arts Center (June 17 ‚Äì August 13, 2017) and Addison/Ripley Fine Art (June 3 ‚Äì July 8, 2017).  Career  =Painter= Chiefly known for his landscapes, Lewton generally depicted cities and suburbs with a detached, impersonal sensibility. Writing about his watercolors in Arts magazine in 1980, Harry Rand observed, ‚ÄúEither by implication or statement, personalities are absent from Lewton‚Äôs work; there is hardly a sense of the lives that move through those spaces he describes.‚Äù The critic compared the artist to Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, and Charles Sheeler. Lewton painted from a young age. On a family trip to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, he discovered the work of Henri Matisse, an encounter that permanently influenced his artistic vision. In the early 1960s, Lewton lived in southern California and taught art classes at the University of California Riverside. During this period, he was inspired by the paintings of Roger Kuntz and the murals of Jos√© Clemente Orozco. In 1963, he reached out to his former Claremont professor, David Scott, then Assistant Director of the National Collection of Fine Arts, who encouraged him to apply to the Smithsonian Institution. The result was a cross-country move to the Washington, D.C. area, and two years later he was included in the Corcoran Gallery‚Äôs annual group exhibition of local artists. In 1973, the Studio Gallery gave Lewton his first solo exhibition in D.C., ‚ÄúVal Lewton Is Dale City,‚Äù a title derived from the Virginia suburb of Dale City. In 1985, The Corcoran‚Äôs 1985 ‚ÄúWashington Show‚Äù included Lewton‚Äôs large-scale painting ‚ÄúH Street Demolition,‚Äù created the previous year. His 60-by-100-foot ‚ÄúAirshaft Mural,‚Äù painted in 1988, relies on a trompe l'oeil effect that gives the viewers the impression of seeing through a concrete pylon built over I-395 to the U.S Capitol Building. \\"I sort of wanted to emphasize the concrete,\\" Lewton told The Washington Post‚Äôs John Kelly. \\"I thought if it looked like it had been penetrated, it would make it look even more solid than it was.\\" = Exhibition designer = Alongside his artistic career, Lewton became known for designing museum exhibitions in ways that suited the style of the artists featured. During his tenure at the National Museum of American Art, which later became the Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM), he created experiences for visitors to discover the work of Robert Rauschenberg, Louis Comfort Tiffany, Thomas Cole, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Frederic Remington, among others. ‚ÄúVal often incorporated a special element in his designs to evoke the era being displayed ‚Äî sometimes as simple as a drapery to evoke a Gilded Age parlor,‚Äù stated SAAM director Elizabeth Broun in Lewton‚Äôs Washington Post obituary. He later worked on a freelance basis for the Phillips Collection and other institutions. In a 2013 blog post for the Phillips, manager of exhibitions Liz Strelka called Lewton the museum's \\"secret weapon.\\" Strelka praised him as \\"a constant and integral part of our exhibitions, and the unsung hero of many an installation, carefully constructing a design layout and paint scheme for most of our special exhibitions, and transforming our spaces for each new exhibition to highlight the inherent qualities of artists and their work on display.\\"  Work in public collections  *National Gallery of Art Corcoran Collection *Smithsonian American Art Museum *The Phillips Collection *American University Katzen Center *The Fralin Museum of Art, University of Virginia *George Washington University *Towson State College *University of the District of Columbia *University of Vermont *The Wilson Building, Washington, DC *DC Commission on Arts & Humanities, Washington, DC References  External links  *https://www.vallewtonpainter.com *http://www.northgallerydesign.com 1937 births 2015 deaths American painters American designers Artists from Santa Monica, California University of California, Riverside faculty Whitman College alumni ","title":"Val Lewton (visual artist)"},{"id":"53423163","text":"Run Away Home is a 1997 book by Patricia McKissack.

It was demolished in 1491 during construction on the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. Name and location San Ciriaco was located near the Via Lata, not far from the so-called arcus Diburi, which was afterwards called the Camilianum. Mariano Armellini describes the arcus Diburi as an ancient arch surmounted by the tower, which was believed to be an entrance to a Roman monument called the Diribitorium, a large building begun by Agrippa, and finished by Augustus. It was apparently used to count votes and distribute salaries to the Roman militias, and its name derives from the diribitores, or election officials. It burned under Titus, together with the adjacent Iseum. By the Middle Ages, the old name of the arch had been lost in common parlance, and it was called arco maggiore (\\"large arch\\") or the arco di Camillo (although according to Christian H√ºlsen that name was more the result of mistaken scholarship in the sixteenth century than an indication that the site was ever associated with someone named Camillus). The arch was eventually named the Camillianum, which was applied to the neighborhood, and by extension, the church of San Ciriaco. Its dedication was to Saint Cyriacus, a Roman martyr of the Diocletianic Persecution, whose relics were kept in the church. History The former location of S. Ciriaco has been identified with the current high altar of S. Maria in Via Lata (shown here). The origins of the church are underhood to be quite ancient, although Armellini notes that the tradition of it dating back to the time of Pope Sylvester is not quite worthy of belief. The church had a substantial connection to Cyriacus himself. His bodies, along with those of his two martyred companions, Largus and Smaragdus, were brought to Rome at the beginning of the fourth century. Their original resting place was near the Porta Salaria. From there they were moved to a cemetery near the Via Ostiensis, and finally, in about the tenth century to transferred ‚Äî not to the church named after him, but to the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata. In 1491, Pope Innocent VIII ordered a complete reconstruction and expansion of the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata, which required the church of San Ciriaco to be demolished. Giovanni Severano attests that San Ciriaco was located precisely where the high altar of Santa Maria in Via Lata is today. The main portal of the church would have been accessed from the modern Via Lata, which connects the Via del Corso to the Piazza del Collegio Romano. =Relation to the stational liturgy= Another church dedicated to Saint Cyriacus in the city ‚Äî San Ciriaco in Thermis ‚Äî was one of the stationes of the ancient Roman stational liturgy, formerly assigned to Tuesday of the fifth week of Lent. The twelfth-century Ordo Romanus XVI provides that San Ciriaco as the site of that day's liturgy. Because it had fallen into ruins, a new station at Santi Quirico e Giulitta was assigned to the day by Pope Sixtus IV (1474‚Äì1484). The station was later transferred to Santa Maria in Via Lata by Pope Sixtus V (1585‚Äì1590) in recognition of the fact that the relics of Saint Cyriacus had been transferred there from San Ciriaco de Camiliano. Santa Maria in Via Lata remains the assigned station for Tuesday of the fifth week of Lent. Monastery The church was noted for the monastery of Ss. Ciriaco e Niccol√≤ (Saints Cyriacus and Nicholas), which was attached to it. H√ºlsen traces the origin of this monastery to the tenth century, citing a document from 972 that refers to monasterium sancti Christi martyris Cyriaci atque Nicolai confessoris, quod ponitur in Via Lata. Armellini states that the name of Saint Nicholas was added to the monastery because there was a church dedicated to him nearby (S. Nicolaus de Pinea), which was eventually subsumed by the monastery complex. H√ºlsen, on the other hand, writes that the additional dedication was due to the translation of some of St. Nicholas' relics in the tenth century, while acknowledging the existence of the church that Armellini mentions. The monastery, having fallen into decadence, was suppressed by Pope Eugene IV with a bull of March 19, 1435. Armellini reports finding in the Vatican Archives a document attesting to the discovery of the cemetery of the ancient monastery church complex, further establishing its location on the current site of Santa Maria in Via Lata: the ruins had been found while the Pamphili family were paving part of their garden to set up a stable. This was during the lifetime of Olimpia Aldobrandini (1623‚Äì1681). In the treasury of the church of Santa Maria in Via Lata, Armellini reports having seen a parchment codex, finished with a cover of beaten silver plate, adorned with cut glass, and containing an ancient copy of the Gospel of Luke. Inside is a dedication, written by the abbess of the monastery of Ss. Ciriaco e Niccol√≤: Suscipe Christe et s. Cyriace atque Nicolae. Hoc opus ego Berta Ancilla Dei fieri iussi. The Gospel book was believed to date from the eleventh century.

She was the longest prison serving suffragette. She worked for Christabel Pankhurst but was sacked; she then worked for Sylvia Pankhurst under name Mary Pederson (or Paterson). In later life she supported women's and children's organisations.  Early life  Mary Elizabeth Phillips was born in St. Mary Bourne, Hampshire, the daughter of William Fleming Phillips and Louisa Elizabeth (Simms) Phillips. Her father was a doctor who worked in Glasgow.  Suffrage activism  Phillips was encouraged by her father to campaign for women's rights and in 1904 she became a paid official of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage. She later reported that this taught her that quiet campaigning was not going to be sufficient and she joined the more radical Women's Social & Political Union in 1907 and established a Glasgow branch of the WSPU. She wrote articles for Forward which was the journal of the Glasgow Independent Labour Party. Phillips assisted Helen Fraser with campaigns for the movement in East Fife. Her next WSPU campaign was in the West of England organising visit plans with Annie Kenney, Elsie Howey, Gladice Keevil, Clara Codd and later was on the platform, speaking in Plymouth in November 1908 with Annie Kenney and Mary Blathwayt. In March 1908 she had been sentenced to six weeks in Holloway Prison following a demonstration outside the House of Commons. As part of another delegation in June 1908, with Emmeline Pankhurst, twelve women including Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Jessie Stephenson, Florence Haig, Maud Joachim and Phillips were turned away from an arranged visit to the Prime Minister on 30 June 1908 and a crowd of supporters tried to rush through a police line who responded with physical force , resulting in a further arrest and 3-month sentence, making Phillips the longest serving suffragette prisoner. A postcard picture of a suffragette being arrested by police is said to be of Phillips. When Phillips was released from prison she was welcomed by Flora Drummond, bagpipes and other suffragettes who posed in tartan for a picture under the slogan \\"Ye Mauna Tramp on the Scotch Thistle Laddie\\". The Scottish suffragettes present compared their struggle to the campaign of William Wallace.alt= Phillips showed other suffragettes different forms of protest, including getting Charlie Marsh to help her pavement chalking in Lambeth, whom Philips noted 'gamely stood the jeering and rough handling' the women got in the process. Her next location from January 1909, was in Newcastle and then back south to Cornwall and Devon. She was among the welcoming party for another released prisoner Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, in April 1909, with the Pankhursts, two Kenney sisters, Vera Wentworth, Minnie Baldock and Mary Gawthorpe. They were taken to join 500 suffragettes at a celebration lunch at the Criterion, Picadilly Circus restaurant. Phillips was arrested later in 1909 again with Vera Wentworth and Elsie Howie for attempting to force their attendance at a men's meeting in Exeter where Lord Carrington in charge of the Agriculture and Fisheries Board was speaking. During her seven days imprisoned she went on hunger strike and was released after four days 'in a dangerous state'. Other WSPU leaders Mary Blathwayt, Emily Blathwayt, wrote in their diaries about Phillips suffering from fainting, and Emmeline Pankhurst wrote to her \\"my dear girl take care of yourself and do everything in your power to recover your health and strength.\\" Phillips also carried out what Christabel Pankhurst called a 'splendid protest' showing ' pluck and ingenuity' by hiding under the stage overnight, jumping out shouting 'Votes for Women' and objecting to Patricia Woodlock's imprisonment when two Cabinet Ministers were being awarded honorary degrees in Liverpool St George's Hall. Millicent Browne planting a tree at Eagle House (suffragette's rest) with Mary Phillips, Vera Wentworth, Elsie Howey and Annie Kenney Phillips was invited to Mary Blathwayt's home at Batheaston where the leading suffragettes met and recovered. It was known as the \\"Suffragette's Rest\\". Significant visitors were asked to plant a tree (in Phiilips case a Picea Pungens Glauca) to record their achievements on behalf of the cause e.g. a prison sentence. Phillips had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU. In November 1909, Phillips wrote to Christabel Pankhurst asking to be relieved of a militant role, which was fully supported and she had no further trouble for the next three years. Around that time she was given the job of being the WSPU organiser in Liverpool but this was short lived and Ada Flatman took over that role. In 1910 Phillips was sent as WSPU organiser for Bradford, when Mrs Pankhurst wrote to her seeking her help to ensure that the women's group did not express sympathy for the loss of Pankhurst's 20-year old son Harry, who had died of polio, by saying ' I want to get through my work, and I know you will all help me do it'. Phillips work at the WSPU mostly under Christabel Pankhurst who had praised her and increased her salary. In late 1912 her own mother, also in the WSPU, had not called Mary to her deathbed in Cornwall due to her belief that the 'movement needed her services'. But on 9 July 1913 she was sacked by Christabel Pankhurst who wrote saying \\"that you are not effective as a district organiser\\"; this may have been due to Phillips no longer strongly favouring militancy. Despite her long support working all over the country, four imprisonments and hunger strike, Phillips had to advertise her own services in 'situations wanted' in The Suffragette. She moved to London's East End, living in Canning Town and immediately went to work with Nora Smyth for Sylvia Pankhurst's rival East London Federation of Suffragettes, with Pankhurst, Keir Hardie, Julia Scurr, Millie Lansbury, Eveline Haverfield, Nellie Cressall and George Lansbury. Phillips continued to promote socialism and wrote for The Women's Dreadnought weekly for working women. She became the full time paid organiser for the federation working with May Billinghurst. In 1916 she was working for the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage who did not support (or decry) militancy. She now went under the name of Mary Pederson or Paterson. Mary inspired working women such as Charlotte Drake, a seamstress and barmaid, a chemical worker's wife and mother of four children under 8 years old, to also become an activist for women's suffrage. Drake was interviewed on the BBC in 1968 and explained the unusual support her husband gave when she was heckled by men about a women's place in society. = Later life = Phillips went on to work for the United Suffragists from 1915-16, and the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and Save the Children Fund. Phillips edited a brewing trade news service from 1928-1955, and then was an editor for the Council of Social Work. She joined the Suffragette Fellowship and Six Point Group, and in an interview in 1955 bemoaned the 'sneaky way' women got the vote as a 'sort of anti-climax really' but 'was very good to be part of it'. Mary Phillips died in a hotel in Hove in Sussex in 1969.

Predating the collapse of the Nazi r√©gime, it is one of the earliest public memorials in Germany to Nazi victims. It was renovated - washed and repainted - in 2013. The memorial enjoys \\"protected\\" status. Erich Garske was born in 1907. He was a technical draftsman by profession. In January 1933, when the Nazis took power, he was already a member of the Communist Party. The Nazis lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity became illegal, and after the Reichstag Fire in February 1933, the authorities devoted particular energy to outlawing activities undertaken on behalf of the Communist Party. Garske nevertheless remained politically active, producing satirical cartoons for the illegal newspapers produced by peace activists. 1933 was also the year in which Erich Garske married Charlotte Schaepe. By the end of 1933 many German communist activists had been arrested, while others had fled into exile. The Garskes did not emigrate and were not, in the short term, arrested. Indeed, when the Communist Party in exile smuggled people back into Germany from Prague, Moscow or Paris to work on party matters, one of the places where they might be hidden and accommodated was in the Garskes' apartment in central Berlin. As early as 1934 they secretly accommodated , a close party colleague of Robert Stamm. From 1942 their Berlin apartment was the work-place and a communications hub for \\"Alfred\\". Erich Garske was able to help Alfred in his work by producing satirical drawings and other art work for illegal party publications, notably with a news journal called \\"Der Friedensk√§mpfer\\" (\\"The Fighter for Peace\\"). \\"Alfred\\" was the code name used by Wilhelm Kn√∂chel, an exceptionally effective communist resistance organiser.

Early life and education Sophy Sanger was born on 3 January 1881 in Westcott, Surrey. She was the youngest daughter of the wealthy London businessman Charles Sanger and Jessie Alice Pulford. At the age of 15, she was sent to Dr. Elizabeth Dawes' school in Weybridge, where she was the only pupil to be taught mathematics. She went up to Newnham College, Cambridge in autumn 1899. Sophy began by studying the Mathematical Tripos from 1899 to 1902 and went on to read moral sciences in 1903. It was in Cambridge at a debate in the Newnham Parliament that Sophy first became interested in politics; listening to a speech by the Quaker Hilda Clark sparked in her a commitment to pacifism.  Work  Sophy Sanger worked for the Women's Trade Union League from 1903 to 1909, setting up its legal advice bureau whilst learning labour law at University College London. Her work on insurance regulations for workplace compensation meant she was called to give evidence before a parliamentary commission in the House of Lords and she helped Labour MPs prepare their case for the Shops Bill. In 1905, Sanger founded a British section of the International Association for Labour Legislation, publishing an English version of its French and German Bulletins. Between 1909 and 1919, she wrote for and edited World's Labour Laws, a quarterly publication which campaigned on issues such as the abolition of child labour, the prohibition of the use of white phosphorus and lead and the prevention of anthrax. She believed that international cooperation and action on specific, practical reforms could effectively combat many worker's rights issues, for example: sweated labour, occupational disease and workplace injury. Sophy Sanger was appointed chief of the International Labour Organization's legislative section, a post she held from its formation in 1919 until 1924.

She is best known for her hand-painted tiles of fairytales, especially of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and Cinderella.  Early life  Lucy Jane Faulkner was born to Benjamin and Ann Faulkner on 16 November 1839 in Birmingham, England. She had two surviving siblings, Charles Joseph Faulkner and Kate Faulkner. They lived in Birmingham until the death of their father, and moved to Bloomsbury after his death. It is unknown what caused his death. Charles had become friends with William Morris when they were both students at Oxford, and through that friendship, Morris was also acquainted with Lucy and Kate. She later married an engraver named Harvey Edward Orrinsmith (son of John Orrin Smith) and changed her surname in the middle of her artistic career. Artistic career Lucy's brother Charles and their friend William Morris founded the company Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., which specialized in home and furniture decoration. At first, Charles hired her and Kate as amateurs just to help with the company, but as they continued working and growing their skills, they were eventually received as legitimate artists and were paid for their labor and compensation. Lucy also became one of the first managers for the company. While her sister Kate dabbled in nearly every aspect of home decorating (including embroidery, tile painting, engraving, gesso painting, and especially wallpaper design), Lucy focused more on painting tiles by hand, which is what she became best known for in the company and as an artist. Lucy Faulkner Orrinsmith was mostly known for her tile paintings of women, particularly from fairytales and legends. Many of her tiles were themed after the Legende of Goode Wimmen, in which there are many depictions of women of classical antiquity. Along with this, she painted stories such as Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast, which were painted in sequence to be hung as mantelpieces over the fireplace. Her paintings of the story of Sleeping Beauty are the more popular of the three stories. After she married Harvey Edward Orrinsmith, however, she stopped painting tiles for Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co., and changed her surname from Faulkner to Orrinsmith. This is one of the primary reasons that she is overshadowed by her sister, Kate. For this reason, many of her works were previously mis-attributed to Kate Faulkner, until it was discovered that Lucy would sign her tiles with either LJF or simply LF. Orrinsmith was also known for writing a book about drawing room decoration entitled The Drawing Room: Its Decorations and Furniture while living in Beckenham, simply under the name ‚ÄúMrs. Orrinsmith‚Äù. In the book, she emphasizes the importance of ‚Äúproperly‚Äù decorating the elements of drawing rooms, including ceilings, walls, moldings, fireplaces, chimneys, skirting, and much more. She also emphasizes using colors that were popular at the time and delves a little into color theory. Lucy also illustrated diagrams depicting how to properly arrange elements within the room and how to decorate everything to look visually appealing to guests. Orrinsmith received plenty of negative criticism and reviews of her book, as many thought that she was very harsh, and that the illustrations that she included as diagrams were of poor quality and did not reflect the skill level that she lectured about in the book. Death and legacy She died in 1910 of unknown causes. Most of her work is located at the William Morris Gallery in London, which has the largest surviving collection of her hand-painted tiles up on display.

Mona Wilson (29 May 1872 ‚Äì 26 October 1954) was a British civil servant and author. She is known for her scholarly work, including The Life of William Blake (1927) and other biographies of literary and historical figures. As a civil servant, she was one of the first women in the United Kingdom to earn equal pay for her work. Life Wilson was born in Hillmorton Road, Rugby to James Wilson (headmaster of Clifton College ) and Annie Elizabeth Moore. She was educated at Clifton High School, Bristol; St Leonard's School, St Andrews; and Newnham College, Cambridge. Wilson became interested in social and industrial problems after she graduated and went on to join the Women's Trade Union League. Wilson became secretary of the Women's Trade Union League in 1899. After being appointed to the National Insurance Commission in 1911, she received a yearly salary of ¬£1000, making her the highest-paid woman civil servant of the time and one of the first women to receive equal pay in the United Kingdom. In 1917, she was involved in creating a mothers' Pensions bill. In 1919, she retired from civil service and began to work on her writing. In 1932, she was made an Associate of Cambridge University.  Writing  She wrote several scholarly works after her retirement from the civil service in 1919, including The Life of William Blake (1927), which went through several reprintings and remained popular for several decades. Her biography of William Blake was considered to be very accessible by Angus Whitehead. The Guardian wrote that Wilson \\"told his story more fully and sensibly than anyone else.\\" The Observer states that her biography was \\"the most satisfactory since Gilchrist.\\" Wilson was featured in Grand Tour: A Journey in the Tracks of the Age of Aristocracy (1935), where she contributes a piece about the Wife of Bath. Jane Austen and Some Contemporaries (1938) describes the biographies of Jane Austen and several women who were her contemporaries. The book was described by The Guardian as being very thorough in its understanding of the people of Austen's time, though a little difficult to follow if the reader is not familiar with the time period. Wilson also published a short story under the nom de plume \\"An Ordeal\\" in The Nation in 1909 and a novella \\"The Story of Rosalind Retold From Her Diary\\" as \\"Monica Moore\\" in 1910.

She served as the first president of the Michigan State Equal Suffrage Association, as well as parliamentarian of the International Label League. She was also the author of a book on parliamentary law. While still a child, she signed the temperance movement pledge under one of the original Washingtonians, later joining the Good Templars and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Early years and education Mary Lydia Thompson was born in Conneaut, Ohio on July 27, 1836, the daughter of Rev. Volney and Lovinia (Singer) Thompson. Her immediate ancestors, the Thompsons and Harpers, emigrated from Vermont and settled in that portion of Ohio known as the Western Reserve. At nine years of age, she was sent to the Conneaut Academy, then just completed. At 15, she began to teach a country school US$1.00 a week and \\"boarded around.\\" Later, she attended the State Normal School (now known as Edinboro University of Pennsylvania) in Edinboro, Pennsylvania. She signed the temperance pledge under one of the original Washingtonians when only eight years old. Career In 1853, Doe joined the Good Templars. In 1878, she became a member of the Michigan Grand Lodge of Good Templars, and held the office of grand vice-templar and of grand assistant secretary for several years. She further showed her interest in temperance by joining the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the various other temperance organizations in the towns where she lived. From the time of the defeat of the suffrage amendment to the Michigan State constitution in 1874, there was no central organization in Michigan for ten years, although a few local societies maintained an existence. In 1877, Doe went to Saginaw, Michigan, where she at once made friends with the advocates of equal suffrage. Through a conjunction of these forces, a convention was called at Flint on May 21, 1884, which resulted in the forming of a State Equal Suffrage Association, with Doe as President, and Governor Josiah Begole as vice-president. She held that office for six years, was active in securing many of the privileges granted to women by the Michigan Legislature, and spent much of her time with other equal suffragists in the State capital. Doe was elected parliamentarian of the International Label League. She was the author of a book on parliamentary law, as well as conducting departments for various newspapers on subjects such as temperance, labor, and woman suffrage. She changed her residence from Saginaw to Bay City in 1886, and opened a store for fancy goods. While a member of Methodist Episcopal Church, she taught Bible classes. She died in Detroit on March 9, 1913, of a cerebral hemorrhage.

The lead single is \\"√â da R√°dio,\\" with a production inspired by The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\\".  Background and development  The band's previous album, Motel, earned the attention from the internet and was very well received by critics. Mateus Carrilho said in an interview that the band's new album would have more less brega music and more pop, reaching larger audiences with radio-friendly songs. He further stated that the new album would be different from the band's previous releases. In search of new sonorities, the band got to collaborate with different producers, including Boss in Drama, Rodrigo Gorky, Pedrowl and Bernardo Martins. The band co-wrote all of the songs: \\"It was a delight to do this second album, ideas bubbled up and we put everything out,\\" Davi Sabbag said.  Critical reception  In its first review, Veneno was praised for its production, since it maintains the good humor that marked the debut of the band, but with a vast sweep of inspirations, mainly from what was being successful in Brazil in the 90s. For Brazilian website It Pop, the album \\"demonstrates that [the band] still has a lot to explore within their influences\\" and \\"while they play with songwriting that revives the national pop, awakening in us a more determined appetite for this genre so underestimated [in Brazil] (...) they go through references to past decades, however looking forward.\\" The website still compared the sound to artists such as Mamonas Assassinas, Bonde do Rol√™ and Blitz. Portal Famosos Brasil also provided the album a favorable review, stating that \\"Veneno ends with an auricular injection of adrenaline, extroversion and euphoria that leave the bittersweet taste of 'I want more'\\" and \\"with the wonderful trashy cover art to the commercial yet risky content they prove, once again, that pop music doesn't need to be taken seriously to have quality.\\"  Copyright claims  The music video for Arrega√ßada was removed from the band's YouTube channel after alleged accusations that they didn't have permission to use the sample of MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This ‚Äì which in turn samples Rick James's Super Freak ‚Äì in the video.

Early life and education  Mary Susan McIntosh was born on 13 March 1936 in Hampstead, North London, to Helena Agnes (Jenny) Britton and her husband Albert William McIntosh, a Jedburgh-born businessman and graduate of the University of Edinburgh, who went on to become the first Professor of Marketing at the London Business School. Both parents were socialists, members of the 1917 Club and later the Communist Party. Her elder brother, Andrew Robert McIntosh, was a Labour politician and minister who was created a life peer, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, in 1982. McIntosh was educated at High Wycombe School for Girls and St Anne's College, Oxford, where she read Philosophy, Politics and Economics. After graduating in 1958, she moved to the United States where she worked as a graduate student and teaching assistant in the Sociology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1960, she was deported from the US for speaking out against the House Un-American Activities Committee.  Academic career  On her return to the UK, McIntosh worked as a researcher for the Home Office from 1961 to 1963 before taking up the post of lecturer in Sociology at the University of Leicester from 1963 to 1968. She later worked at Borough Polytechnic from 1968 to 1972, and as a research fellow studying prostitution at Nuffield College, Oxford, from 1972 to 1975. She joined the University of Essex in 1975 as a lecturer in the Department of Sociology. She later became the first female head of the department, and remained at the University until she retired in 1996. Throughout her career she taught a wide range of courses covering criminology, theory, sociology, social policy, the family, gender studies, feminism and Marxism.  Research  = Criminology and social constructionism = McIntosh's earliest research was in the field of criminology and the sociology of homosexuality. In 1968 she published the paper \\"The Homosexual Role\\" in the journal Social Problems. Based on a survey of gay men in Leicester and London, this paper argued that rather than being a psychiatric or clinical pathology, homosexuality and same sex relationships were influenced by historical and cultural factors, and that \\"homosexual\\" is a social category coercively imposed on some individuals for the purpose of social control. This paper has been described as being crucial in the shaping of social constructionism, a theory later developed by, and widely attributed to, the French philosopher Michel Foucault. McIntosh was critical of the orthodox view of criminology and in 1967 became one of the co-founders of the National Deviancy Symposium following the Third National Conference of Teaching and Research on Criminology at the University of Cambridge. Influenced by sociological approaches and American symbolic interactionism, the Symposium aimed to challenge dominant orthodoxies of crime and deviance and to instigate radical and critical approaches to criminology. Although McIntosh moved away from the field of academic criminology in the mid-1970s, she was a member of the Policy Advisory Committee to the Criminal Law Revision Committee from 1976 to 1985 which reviewed legislation relating to sexual offences. Through this committee, she was involved in efforts to lower the age of male homosexual consent from 21 to 18.  Gay and women's rights  In 1970, McIntosh and her partner Elizabeth Wilson were among a small group of lesbians who contributed to founding and shaping the direction of the London Gay Liberation Front at the London School of Economics. McIntosh was influential within the Gay Liberation Front and was one of the small group that authored the Gay Liberation Front: Manifesto in 1971. Along with a group of feminist colleagues McIntosh founded the journal Feminist Review in 1979, and remained an active member of the journal collective until the early 1990s. McIntosh was committed to campaigning for the legal and financial rights of married and co-habiting women, a cause she pursued with the Fifth Demand Group. McIntosh was also an active member of Feminists Against Censorship, a group of sex positive feminists founded in 1989, who argued against censorship of pornography and defended sexual expression and the right to produce sexually explicit material. McIntosh argued against radical separatist feminist critiques of pornography. Throughout her life McIntosh continued to forge links between the gay liberation movement, the women's movement and lesbian movements.  Politics  McIntosh espoused a sophisticated Marxist feminism and was a member of the Communist Party from 1974.  Retirement  Following her retirement from the University of Essex in 1996, McIntosh worked with the Citizens Advice Bureau in Islington, North London. She entered a civil partnership with Angela Stewart-Park in 2005. After suffering a first stroke in 2010, she died at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London on 5 January 2013 after suffering a second stroke. Her remains were cremated at Marylebone cemetery on 18 January.

Early life  Curtis was born on 2 October 1886 in Sunderland. She was the daughter of George Curtis and Annie Johnson. The former worked at the Post Office while his wife was an elementary school teacher. Curtis was educated at Allan's Endowed Girls' School, Newcastle upon Tyne, Winchester High School and Newnham College, Cambridge. After finishing school, she was an editor of the Victoria County History for seven years while also working as a private tutor.  Civil service  Curtis' civil service career began in 1915 when she became part of the temporary staff of the War Trade Intelligence Department. By 1918, she transferred to the Ministry of Food and became the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Establishment Branch from 1920 to 1922. She became a permanent civil servant in 1923 after passing the first competitive examination for super- clerical grade women, in which she placed first. She then held positions in the Ministry of Pensions and the Post Office. Later, she was assumed the Assistant Secretary and Director of Women's Establishments in the Treasury, which was considered the premier women's post in the Civil Service. She retired from government work in 1942, Curtis headed a government committee addressing children care for England and Wales in 1946. This resulted to the so-called Curtis Report, which was described as \\"the first enquiry in this country directed specifically to the care of children deprived of a normal home life\\". It was presented to the Labour government, which replaced the war- time coalition government in 1945. The report led to the enactment of the Children Act of 1948, which mandated that every local authority must set up a children's committee to advance children's interests. Curtis was created a Dame of the British Empire in 1949.  Academic career  Following her retirement from the civil service in 1941, Curtis was elected Principal of Newnham College, taking office in January 1942. She would hold the post until 1954. She enabled the college to carry on in the face of wartime and immediate post-war restrictions, and as a civil servant, worked to improve the efficiency of academic administration. It was a difficult and frustrating process, particularly amid the restrictions of the post-war period. Curtis played an important part in the negotiations on behalf of the women's colleges which resulted in women finally being awarded degrees from the University of Cambridge. In 1952 she was the first woman elected to the council of the Senate at Cambridge, and she chaired the women's appointments board. She also chaired a committee which promoted the establishment of a third women's college to accommodate the growing number of women at Cambridge: the result was New Hall, opened in October 1954, and now Murray Edwards College.

It is described in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR Part 10). Pharmaceutical companies routinely use FDA citizen petitions to delay the entry of generic drugs into the United States marketplace. Companies use this to counter the parts of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act which make generic drugs more available. In 2016 Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America requested various changes to the FDA petition process which the FDA declined. In November 2016 the FDA updated the citizen petition process. Most citizen petitions are filed by drug companies against competing drug companies. Innovator companies may also present arguments to the FDA that the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) should not be accepted by filing a \\"citizen petition\\" with the FDA. Citizen petitions are part of the basic law governing everything the FDA does - at any time, any ‚Äúinterested person‚Äù can request that the FDA ‚Äúissue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order,‚Äù or ‚Äútake or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action.‚Äù Originally there was no deadline by which the FDA had to respond to citizen petitions filed to protest ANDAs, leading to significant delays in approving generics. In 2007 the law was amended to include a new section, Section 505(q), in the part of the federal code created by the Hatch-Waxman Act; this section said that the FDA could not delay approving an ANDA due to concerns raised in a citizen petition unless the delay was \\"necessary to protect public health issues\\"; it also mandated that the FDA needed to respond to a petition within 180 days - this was shorted to 150 days in a 2011 amendment. In 2014 the FDA issued guidance to industry about submitting citizen petitions and how it would consider them.

Anna Matlack Richards (1834‚Äì1900) was a 19th-century American children's author, poet and translator best known for her fantasy novel, A New Alice in the Old Wonderland. Biography Anna Matlack was raised in a prominent intellectual Quaker family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As a young woman she published fictional works, plays, and poems, including a fictional autobiography as by \\"Mrs. A. M. Richards\\" entitled Memories of a Grandmother in 1854. In 1856 she married landscape and maritime painter William Trost Richards. They traveled abroad frequently and lived in Cornwall, England, from 1878 to 1880. The couple had eight children, only five of whom lived past infancy. Matlack educated the children at home to a pre-college level in the arts and sciences. One of the couple's sons, Theodore William Richards, would later win the 1914 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Anna Richards Brewster, their sixth child, went on to become an important painter in her own right, having received an early arts education from her father as well. In 1881 Matlack published Dramatic Sonnets, a collection of verses designed \\"to give expression to every possible form of conflicting thought and feeling\\". In the 1890s, she published comic poems for children in the popular children's magazines Harper's Young People and The St. Nicholas Magazine. The success of these comics led her to publish A New Alice in the Old Wonderland in 1895, which featured illustrations by her daughter Anna Richards Brewster.

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 1992. He received the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit from Fran√ßois Mitterrand in 2003.  Biography  All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi Born on 4 November 1949 in Amritsar, in the Indian state of Punjab, Mehra did his schooling at Bishop Cotton School, Simla and earned his graduate degree (BSc) with human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry as optional subjects from Government Medical College, Amritsar in 1969 before moving to Delhi to complete his master's degree (MSc) in human anatomy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS). He continued at AIIMS for his doctoral studies and after securing a PhD in 1975 on the immunology of leprosy, did post-doctoral work on histocompatibility and immunogenetics at the laboratory of Jon van Rood in the Netherlands and later with John A. Hansen at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle. On his return to India, he joined his alma mater, AIIMS, as a pool officer in 1977. In 1979, he was elevated to lecturer with the additional responsibility of the clinical and research activities of the Histocompatibility Laboratory established under the Department of Anatomy in 1977, the year he joined AIIMS. In 1993, the laboratory, which served as the core laboratory in India for workshops on histocompatibility as well as a base for researches on human leukocyte antigen (HLA), was upgraded to a full-fledged department under the name \\"Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics\\", which he headed as its founding chair, in the capacity of a professor and served out his career at AIIMS in that position. He also served as the member secretary of the Research Advisory Council and chaired the Dean's Research Committee (DRC) at AIIMS. At the time of his official retirement from service in 2004, he was serving as the Dean of Research and post-retirement, he holds the Dr. C. G. Pandit National Chair of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) at AIIMS, continuing his research at the institution. Mehra resides in AIIMS Campus, in Ansari Nagar, New Delhi.  Legacy  A hand affected by rheumatoid arthritis Mehra, whose research has covered various aspects of histocompatibility and immunogenetics, started his work on the subjects during his post-doctoral days in Europe, and at John Hansen's laboratory in Seattle, where he used DNA-based technologies of HLA analysis to study the immunogenetic aspects of rheumatoid arthritis. Later, in India, he studied HLA-linked genes and identified that a subtype of HLA-DR2 carried a unique class II haplotype which made humans susceptible to diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis. He also differentiated the Indian rheumatoid arthritis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients from the Western Caucasian patients by demonstrating that the former showed a pattern of HLA-DR and HLA- DQ association and these studies helped in characterizing the Indian population with regard to its genomic diversity. His group demonstrated that HLA genes with specific pockets in the peptide binding region controlled the severity of mycobacterial diseases, which was a first-time discovery. Together with Ajay Kumar Baranwal of AIIMS Delhi and Brian D. Tait of the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, he carried out a research project, Antibody Repertoire and graft outcome following solid organ transplantation, which assisted in the prediction of graft rejection and had significance in organ and bone marrow transplantation. He also guided a team of scientists in a project based on polymorphic immunomodulatory genes for developing molecular medicine to combat infectious, autoimmune and rheumatological diseases. His research has been published by way of over 450 articles; of which 287 are listed by ResearchGate. Besides, he has published a book, The HLA Complex in Biology and Medicine: A Resource Book, and has contributed chapters to books published by other researchers, including Textbook of Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Allied and Molecular Medicine. His researches have been cited by many authors, too. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi established a Histocompatibility Laboratory under its Department of Anatomy in 1977, the year Mehra joined as a pool officer at the institution. Subsequently, he took over the activities of the laboratory and by the time he was promoted to professor in 1993, the laboratory had developed into a referral centre as well as a core laboratory for histocompatibility workshops and AIIMS elevated its status to an independent department, the Department of Transplant Immunology and Immunogenetics, with Mehra as its founding chair. Under the aegis of the new department and in association with Dadhichi Deh Dan Samiti, he established the first Asian Indian Donor Marrow Registry (AIDMR), a database of the donors of bone marrow in India in 1994. He would later explain the details of the registry through an article, Asian Indian donor marrow registry: All India Institute of Medical Sciences experience, published in Transplantation Proceedings in 2007. He has delivered a number of keynote addresses or invited lectures including MedIndia 2003 2013 seminar of human genomics at the Guru Nanak Dev University, 2016 India-Japan Regulatory Symposium, and a Guest lecture series organized by Manipur University in 2016.

With one exception, the collection of poems were written at sea by Longfellow in October 1842. The poems were reprinted as anti-slavery tracts two different times during 1843. Longfellow, very conscious of his public persona, published the poems even though he feared it would hurt him commercially. At the time of publication reviews were mixed, but more recently critics (now less bothered by what was earlier done away with as mere sentimentality) have begun to appreciate the collection again, for its political message and for its rhetorical strategies.  Contents  *\\"To William E. Channing\\" ::This poem serve as a dedication to the book and is addressed to William Ellery Channing. It is written in common meter with five stanzas. *\\"The Slave's Dream\\" ::This poem speaks about how a slave sees his home land in his memories, where he is a king. *\\"The Good Part\\" ::This poem tells of how a woman gives her life and fortune to the abolition of slavery. *\\"The Slave in the Dismal Swamp\\" ::A poem about a hunted slave hiding in the Great Dismal Swamp while he hears the hounds baying in the distance. It has six stanzas. *\\"The Slave Singing at Midnight\\" ::This poem is about a lonely slave singing from the Psalms of David. *\\"The Witnesses\\" ::This poem is representing a sunken ship of slaves on the bottom of the ocean as a witness to the slave trade. *\\"The Quadroon Girl\\" ::Poem in twelve stanzas, common meter, about a slave owner who, after raping his maid, sells his own daughter, a quadroon girl, to a slaver who takes her as his sexual slave. *\\"The Warning\\" (written before his trip to Europe) ::Longfellow speaks to the United States anticipating the violence to come, and likens the slaves to the Biblical Samson.  Composition and publication  Many factors that helped influence Longfellow to compose Poems on Slavery. As a young man he read Benjamin Lundy's Genius of Universal Emancipation in his father's library. He considered writing a drama on the subject of Toussaint l'Ouverture so \\"that I may do something in my humble way for the great cause of Negro emancipation\\". Charles Sumner wished Longfellow would devise verses on slavery; Sumner wrote to Longfellow encouraging him to \\"write some stirring words that shall move the whole land\\". Longfellow traveled to Europe for six months in 1842 for his health. In October, before he set sail back home from England, he wrote to Charles Sumner from Charles Dickens's study and mentioned that Dickens's new book, American Notes, had a chapter on slavery. Longfellow wrote the poems soon to be collected as Poems on Slavery that month while on the return voyage to the United States, which fulfilled Sumner's request. Of the eight poems, seven were written while Longfellow was confined to his cabin during a fifteen-day storm. He envisioned his poems during the sleepless nights and then wrote them in the morning. When Longfellow returned home he added a poem he had written previously, and published the eight poems in a 30-page pamphlet. The poem \\"The Good Part\\" was deemed inappropriate, without any type of explanation, for reprinting in Longfellow's Poems on Slavery, by the New England Anti-slavery Tract Association in 1843. In January 1843, Longfellow corresponded with Rufus Wilmot Griswold about reviewing his Poems on Slavery in Graham's Magazine. Griswold wrote to Longfellow that George Rex Graham objected to publishing the title of Longfellow's work, and the magazine made no mention of the poems. In December 1843, Elihu Burritt requested Longfellow's permission to print some of his Poems on Slavery as tracts. In 1845, Poems on Slavery was omitted from Longfellow's collected Poems due to his worry that they could ruin sales in the Southern and Western states. = Longfellow's correspondence regarding the poems= Longfellow sent several letters and copies of the poems to friends and family. In a letter to Henry Russell Cleveland in November 1842, Longfellow told of how he had written the poems on his way home and \\"shall not dare to send them to you in Cuba, for fear of having you seized as an Abolitionist\\". In December 1842, Longfellow sent a letter to John Forster with a copy of the poems. Longfellow wanted to see the how society would respond to the poems and wanted to add more later. A letter that Longfellow wrote to William Plumer Jr discussed how he wrote his poems in a kind spirit. Longfellow sent a letter to his father, Stephen Longfellow, in January 1843, discussing how he thought the poems made an impression. He wrote Ferdinand Freiligrath in January 1843 to let him know that he had used one or two of the wild animals from his menagerie for the poem Slaves Dream. Longfellow wrote to George Lunt that he was \\"sorry you find so much to gainsay in my Poems on Slavery\\" and spoke about his beliefs by using an article by William Ware from the Christian Examiner. Longfellow received many letters about his poems and some people even regretted that Longfellow had written them. Longfellow said his feelings prompted him to write about such things and that he had no regrets about writing them. Longfellow refused to speak at antislavery rallies, though John Greenleaf Whittier attempted to get him to run as a candidate for an antislavery party for Congress. Longfellow felt the apparent political nature of the Poems on Slavery was not something he wished to do again.  Reviews  The book received attention due to it being such a controversial topic and Longfellow's notability. Margaret Fuller, editor of The Dial, reviewed Longfellow's poems in her magazine. She called it \\"the thinnest of all Mr. Longfellow's thin books; spirited and polished, like its forerunners; but the topic would warrant a deeper tone\\". In 1843 John Forster wrote a lengthy review of slavery and Longfellow's poems in the English magazine The Examiner. Forster said about Longfellow's poems: \\"An excellent feeling predominates throughout them, and much graphic power is displayed in the descriptions. Admirable, and most picturesque is this which follows.\\" In May 1843, Longfellow wrote a review of his Poems on Slavery to Isaac Appleton Jewett in a personal letter. Longfellow spoke of how the poems had favorable reception from people, and how he thought that they were \\"so mild that even a slaveholder might read them without losing his appetite for breakfast\\".  Legacy  Even though Poems on Slavery are considered mild today and lacked widespread recognition, the poems are still in print today along with his other poems. Janet Harris, in 1978, remarked on the courage it must have taken for a man like Longfellow, who took such great interest in the public perception, to publish these controversial poems in 1842, even at the risk of it hurting sales for his other writings. Paul K. Johnston, Professor of English at State University of New York at Plattsburgh, notes that Poems on Slavery, like Uncle Tom's Cabin, is \\"rehabilitated as a political statement on behalf of its marginalized characters\\", and has survived a half-century of formalist literacy in the 20th century that considered his and Stowe's work merely sentimental and didactic. Johnston notes also that some of Longfellow's \\"strategies and images\\" anticipate Stowe's.

Maria E. Beasley (n√©e Kenny; 1847-1904) was an entrepreneur and inventor. She is best known for her barrel- making machines and her improvements to the life raft, and she held fifteen different patents in the United States and two in Great Britain.  Biography  =Personal life= Beasley was born Maria Kenny in 1847https://www.amightygirl.com/blog?p=12223. Little is known of her upbringing or education. It is unclear how she was inspired to become an inventor, though some speculate that she was influenced by the Centennial Exhibition (and specifically the Women‚Äôs Pavilion) in 1876. She was married to Samuel Beasley in 1865, and ran the household in addition to her business and creative pursuits. Philadelphia directories from 1880-1890 (with one break in 1887) list her as a dressmaker, despite her filing several patents and developing a barrel-making business during that time. Between 1891 and 1896, Chicago directories listed her occupation as inventor. Beasley died in 1904. = Inventions = Beasley's first patent was granted in 1878. She then had invented a barrel-hooping machine, which she showed at the World Industrial and Cotton Exposition in 1884. Beasley's barrel-hooping machine was designed to speed up the manufacturing of barrels, enabling 1,500 to be produced a day. Beasley's barrel-hooping machine made her quite a lot of money, with the Evening Star writing in 1889, that she \\"made a small fortune out of a machine for the manufacture of barrels.\\" Her invention could make 1,500 barrels a day. Beasley's other inventions included foot warmers, cooking pans, anti- derailment devices for trains and two improved life raft designs, which were also patented in Britain.  Barrel-Making Machines  Beginning in 1878, Maria Beasley received a series of eight patents for the barrel-making process. These included six mechanical patents, including two simply labeled barrel-making machines, two for hoop-driving, one for barrel setup, and one for barrel-stave shaping. She displayed a barrel-making machine at the World‚Äôs Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans in 1884. Her inventions attracted sugar and oil refineries, and royalties from contracts involving the use of her barrel-hooping machine alone amounted to $20,000 annually. Some accounts also suggest that she ran a business of manufacturing barrels herself, in addition to the contracts she had with sugar and oil companies. Life raft design After her success in the barrel-making industry, Beasley sought to create a better life raft that was \\"fire-proof, compact, safe and readily launched.\\" She invented this new design in 1880. Her new design included guard railings surrounding the raft and rectangular metal floats. This design is able to fold and unfold so it is easy to store, even with the rails. Prior to Beasley‚Äôs design, life rafts were typically flat, wooden boards. The concepts of guard rails and reduced size for storage remain in use today, although her exact designs have been long outdated.

Joseph is beating chestnuts from a tree. The Rest on the Flight into Egypt is a subject in Christian art showing Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus resting during their flight into Egypt. The Holy Family is normally shown in a landscape.Schiller, 121‚Äì122; Hall, 124 The subject did not develop until the second half of the fourteenth century, though it was an \\"obvious step\\" from depictions of the \\"legend of the palm tree\\" where they pause to eat dates and rest; palm trees are often included.Schiller, 121‚Äì122; on the miracle itself: 118‚Äì119, 121 It was a further elaboration of the long-standing traditions of incidents that embellished the story of the Flight into Egypt, which the New Testament merely says happened, without giving any details.Schiller, 117‚Äì122 The earliest known Rest is a panel in the large compartmented Grabow Altarpiece by the north German painter Meister Bertram, from about 1379,Schiller, 122 and the subject was mainly found north of the Alps until 1500 or later. Most depictions are made for wealthy homes rather than churches, and the subject only rarely forms part of cycles of the Life of Christ in churches (though the Grabow Altarpiece is one exception). As landscape painting increased in popularity, it became an alternative to the original scene of the family on the road, and by the late sixteenth century perhaps overtook it in popularity.Schiller, 122; Boston The figures are often simply resting, but sometimes more definite camping or picnicking is shown, perhaps assisted by angels. In earlier pieces the Virgin is sometimes breastfeeding, connecting to the long-standing iconography of the Virgo Lactans.Prado Joseph may be active, gathering firewood or fetching water, but in later pieces he is sometimes fast asleep, which the Virgin rarely is. In larger landscapes, other legendary incidents from the Flight may be seen in the distance.Schiller, 122‚Äì123 Background The single New Testament account, in Matthew 2:14, merely says (of Joseph): \\"When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt\\".Authorized Version This account was embellished in various early New Testament apocrypha, which added various legendary incidents. Late medieval accounts continued to add detail, in particular the Vita Christi of Ludolph of Saxony, completed about 1374, just a few years before the time that the first artistic depiction of the Rest is found. This includes a description of Mary breastfeeding, which is found in Meister Bertram's Grabow Altarpiece, the first known painting.Ainsworth, 308 Ludolph also mentions the journey passing \\"through dark and uninhabited forests, and by very long routes past rough and deserted places to Egypt\\",Ainsworth, 308 setting the tone for the great majority of the landscape settings throughout the history of the depiction, though the trees usually clear sufficiently to allow a distant view.David, 249 Hans Memling triptych, 1475‚Äì1480, Louvre While the miraculous legends like the miracles of the palm tree, corn, and pagan statue all fell under the disapproval of the Church in the Counter-Reformation, and generally disappear from art, that the Holy Family must have broken their journey for rests was undeniable, so that the subject's legitimacy in scriptural terms was defensible. The subject also suited Counter-Reformation drives to promote down to earth realism into New Testament subjects, and to increase the role of Saint Joseph. It thus increased in popularity as the other accretions to the story reduced.Hall, 124; Boston One of the legends, going back to the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (perhaps 7th-century), was that at the same time as the \\"miracle of the palm-tree\\" on the third day of the journey, a spring miraculously appeared when the travellers needed water, and the Rest is often set beside a spring or stream, though this can be regarded as natural.Hand and Wolff, 64 Christ taking leave of his Mother is another subject with similar origins in late medieval meditational literature. It seems to have been taken up by Passion plays, and does not appear in art before the late 15th century, peaking in the approximate period 1500‚Äì1520, mostly in Germany.Hall, 67; Langmuir, Erica, The National Gallery Companion Guide, p. 102, 1997 revised edition, National Gallery, London, Development of compositions Rest on the Flight by Caravaggio, c.1597, Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome The panel in the Grabow Altarpiece emphasises eating and drinking: Jesus is breastfeeding, the donkey drinking from a stream, and Joseph eating (probably bread) while offering Mary a bottle. Although the painting has a gold ground, this is one of the panels where landscape settings are painted around the edges. For about a century after this, depictions remain few. An altarpiece by Hans Memling (Louvre) marks the beginning of a sharp increase in depictions of the scene, and introduces the miracles to the background landscape,Prado though the composition, with a standing Virgin, is unusual. In the decades around 1500 the Virgin and Child often dominate the composition in Early Netherlandish paintings, with Joseph and the donkey in the middle distance, if they are visible at all. In a Gerard David in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, Joseph is seen in the background gathering food by beating a chestnut tree with a long stick, a detail probably borrowed from miniatures of the Labours of the Months in the calendars of books of hours, and perhaps a northern substitute for the dates in the legends.Hand and Wolff, 64‚Äì65; Washington page The Washington painting appears to be the earliest in a number of paintings of the subject, or using the central figures in other contexts, that were apparently produced by transfer from copies of drawings. Many of these are loosely attributed to the large Bruges workshop of Adriaen Isenbrandt.David, 279‚Äì295 Despite the fact that on the Flight itself Joseph is invariably shown on foot, leading the donkey on which Mary and the child are seated, in Rests,Schiller, 120‚Äì121; in the West, \\"variants are exceptions and are unimportant as far as the sense of the image is concerned\\" (p. 121). Joseph is typically still shown standing, if not engaged in some activity. After the High Renaissance he often stands behind the Virgin, giving a pyramidal group of figures when she is flanked by angels. Relatively few depictions show him resting his feet seated next to Mary, or eating. These include an engraving of c. 1506 by Lucas van Leyden,British Museum page and a chiaroscuro drawing by Hans Springinklee of 1514.British Museum page The wider landscape of the Patinir in the Prado allows space for depictions in the distance (at right) of the Massacre of the Innocents which provoked the flight, and the \\"miracle of the corn\\". The falling pagan idols are shown both on the top of the temple at far left (though a statue of a rat-headed god is intact) and by the pair of metal feet on the sphere next to the Virgin. The donkey is grazing some way off, and Joseph seems to have obtained a pot of milk, which he is carrying back.Prado There are a number of versions by Patinir or his circle; other prolific makers of Rests include Jan Brueghel the Elder and Jan Brueghel the Younger and various collaborators, and Simone Cantarini (1612‚Äì1648). Part way through painting what would have been an early Italian version of the subject, Giovanni Cariani seems to have changed his mind and added shepherds to create an \\"eccentric\\" composition of the Adoration of the Shepherds (1515-17, Royal Collection).Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque, p. 198, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, Rembrandt's only nightscape, 1647, National Gallery of Ireland Untypical examples with specific activities include the famous Caravaggio, where Joseph holds the sheet music for an angel playing a viol; here both the Virgin and Child have fallen asleep.Schiller, 123 The only piece of detail the gospel gives is that the flight began \\"at night\\", but landscape scenes at night were very rare in art in the first centuries of the subject. In a night scene by Rembrandt (1647, Dublin), the family seem to have joined some herdsmen with a big fire for the night; this is his only night landscape.National Gallery of Ireland page This relates to the painting of the Flight by Adam Elsheimer where they are just arriving at such an improvised encampment; Rembrandt would have known this from a print.Slive, 77, 181 Two other unusual treatments from Dutch Golden Age painting are a realist scene showing the family in more or less contemporary dress in a run-down Dutch tavern or farmhouse by Abraham Bloemaert (1634, Rijksmuseum), and one with Joseph reading from a large book, no doubt religious, by Aert de Gelder (c. 1690, Boston).Boston page The subject is sometimes not easily distinguished from the Holy Family in Egypt, though the presence of the young John the Baptist, and a house nearby, suggest this, as the presence of the traditional ass or donkey suggests a Rest. In any case the \\"rest\\" was sometimes later interpreted to include the entire stay in Egypt, which according to the Golden Legend lasted seven years. A woodcut in Albrecht D√ºrer's series on the Life of the Virgin is always known as a Rest on the Flight, despite showing Joseph clearly well settled in Egypt, with a large house, and busy working on his carpentry, assisted by angels.Schiller, 123 Philipp Otto Runge, 1805, Kunsthalle Hamburg In the same way, depictions of the Flight which include the miracle of the date palm approach being a Rest, as in the influential engraving by Martin Schongauer (before 1491), where Mary remains sitting on the stationary donkey as Joseph gathers dates.Hutchison, 6; Shestack, #40. It was loosely copied by Albrecht D√ºrer, and closely by many others. From about 1550 Italian paintings often have infestations of putti- angels, following German examples in prints,Shestack, #117, by Master BM, with four more grown-up singing angels (British Museum page. Another four assist Joseph in the Schongauer just mentioned, #40 and paintings from the first decade of the century by Lucas Cranach the Elder and Albrecht Altdorfer. General trends in landscape painting affect treatments of the subject. Like the Flight, it was popular with Joachim Patinir and his circle, who set the family amid extensive world landscapes. Maryan Ainsworth contrasts this group, centred on the outward-looking international trading-centre of Antwerp, with the paintings dominated by large figures of the Virgin and Child produced by Gerard David and his circle, based in Bruges, a city that had lost commercial pre-eminence and was now turning in on itself.David, 241‚Äì253, especially 252 18th-century depictions were often set beside classical ruins, and a few 19th- century ones featured Ancient Egyptian architecture. Some Romantic depictions placed the incident in lush paradisal settings, notably one that is \\"the first successful realization of Philipp Otto Runge's ambition to unite Christian orthodoxy with Romantic mysticism and his own personal cosmology\\",German, 186 or, less appreciatively, one where \\"he seeks to express the working of divine forces in nature in a vague, emotional manner\\".Schiller, 123 Examples  * Rest on the Flight to Egypt with Saint Francis, by Correggio, c.1520, Uffizi, Florence. * The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, by Paris Bordone, c.1530, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg * Rest on the Flight into Egypt, c. 1597, by Caravaggio, Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome * Rest on the Flight into Egypt, 1630, by Anthony van Dyck, Alte Pinakothek, Munich. * The Rest on the Flight into Egypt, 1640s (?)Metropolitan page oil on copper, by Pier Francesco Mola, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York * Rest on the Flight into Egypt, c.1665 , by Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.

The episode was written by Angela Kang and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. The episode focuses primarily on Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) accompanying Rosita (Christian Serratos) on a secret mission to assassinate Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) in order to avenge their late boyfriend, Abraham Ford. Elsewhere, Simon (Steven Ogg) and the Saviors pay an unexpected visit to the Hilltop with plans of taking more than just supplies. Plot At the Hilltop, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) have begun training survivors, including Enid (Katelyn Nacon), how to use knives offensively in preparation for the imminent war against the Saviors. Surprising everyone, Simon (Steven Ogg) and a crew of Saviors raid the community, forcing Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Maggie to hide in the cellar. Aware of the Saviors' arrival, Sasha packs her bag and takes Rosita (Christian Serratos) to a secret escape hatch that passes beneath the perimeter wall. After sneaking out of the Hilltop, both rebels begin to carry out their secret mission. During the raid, a Savior walks toward the cellar doors. Enid desperately tries to distract him away from the basement, but he proceeds to enter the cellar. As Daryl, held back from Maggie, readies his knife to attack, the Savior searches the cellar, but soon leaves with some supplies and shuts the door. Once he's gone, Maggie remarks to Daryl that he hasn't spoken a word to her ever since he returned to the Hilltop. Crying, Daryl apologizes to Maggie for unintentionally causing Glenn's death. Maggie resolutely maintains Daryl wasn't to blame, saying that Glenn knew Daryl was \\"good\\", and that nearly killing a Savior unnecessarily would only have detracted from the bigger goal ‚Äî winning the war; they embrace. Eventually, the Saviors leave with Dr. Harlan Carson (R. Keith Harris) in tow, as their new doctor, so that he can replace his now-deceased brother, Emmett Carson, who was burned alive inside a furnace after being thrown in by Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) for a false confession. The Hilltop residents gather at the gates and watch the Saviors leave with Dr. Carson. Gregory (Xander Berkeley), sensing their disappointment, shifts around uncomfortably and continues to lose credibility as a leader. Situating themselves in an empty building near the Sanctuary, Sasha and Rosita set up a sniper's nest. While waiting, they bond over their purpose and past events. At night, Sasha and Rosita attempt to sneak into the Sanctuary, where they encounter Eugene (Josh McDermitt) from the other side of a fence. They urge Eugene to come with them and escape, but he refuses. He tells them to go away and heads back inside the compound; Rosita curses at Eugene, in sincere disappointment. At Sasha's suggestion, Rosita keeps watch as Sasha slips through the fence, but doesn't notice Sasha using a lock to close the opening behind her so that she can lock Rosita out. Despite Rosita's protest, Sasha explains to her that it isn't her \\"time\\" and that Alexandria still needs her. Leaving Rosita behind, Sasha breaks into the Sanctuary, through an open door, to kill Negan herself. Sasha kills another Savior in the process, leaving her fate unknown. As gunfire breaks out, Rosita sobs in frustration and flees when she hears Saviors approaching, but eventually stops to catch her breath and notices a dark figure, holding a crossbow, watching her from a small distance. Production The episode largely focuses on Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and Rosita (Christian Serratos). Martin-Green commented on Sasha's sacrifice as symbolic of the themes of the season saying, \\"I think so many of us have realized that the only fight worth fighting is one for the future. Our value of life has expanded beyond concern for ourselves. We're leaders of this world and we're building a future for us, for our children and hopefully our children's children. Regardless of the sacrifice. It's a prevailing theme of the back half of the season and I think it's an astounding truth.\\" She said, \\"Rosita is needed elsewhere. There has to be a point to these sacrifices, as I say to her, and there would be no point for her to join me when this is my path alone to take. It was definitely emotional, but there was joy there too, the joy that comes from reconciliation and the joy that comes from stepping into what you believe is your purpose.\\" Serratos mentioned the bonding scene between Rosita and Sasha was the most dialogue she ever had on the show. On Rosita's backstory, she commented, \\"She knew that what she had to offer was her appearance and that it could benefit her if she chose to utilize it, and that‚Äôs what she did to survive. And I thought that was just really cool, and the fact that she was doing it 10 times better than all these dudes is a really cool message.\\" The episode also features the re-appearance of Maggie (Lauren Cohan), who has been absent for four consecutive episodes and was last seen briefly in \\"Rock in the Road.\\" This episode also is the first to address the sexual orientation of Jesus. Actor Tom Payne promised ‚Äúhe is the same as he is the comic books in that regard,‚Äù and later said, ‚ÄúI was excited to first establish Jesus as a kick-ass ninja, then have the fact that he happens to be gay dropped in later. The way it‚Äôs done is subtle. It‚Äôs a small moment.‚Äù Reception =Critical reception= The scenes involving Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) (pictured) were noted as highlights, but most critics felt Sasha's decision to sacrifice herself to save Rosita (Christian Serratos) was manufactured. \\"The Other Side\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 69% with an average rating of 6.0 out of 10, based on 29 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"The Other Side\\" delves into the sorrowful aftermath of losing key characters with a slow-building narrative that gathers speed‚Äîand gains power‚Äîalong the way. Writing for Forbes, Erik Kain appreciated the focus on Sasha and Maggie, despite it being more of a \\"Sasha and Rosita\\" episode. He was critical of the decision to go with Rosita's plan rather than Sasha's plan \\"to use the sniper rifle to actually, you know, snipe Negan from a distance\\" rather than Rosita's insistence to \\"go inside the gate. Because I guess you need a sniper rifle for close quarters combat.\\" Kain was critical of Sasha's decision to save Rosita saying, \\"If the show had really explained that Rosita was this awesome, essential part of group, I'd be more inclined to agree with Sasha's decision. As it stands, Sasha seems just as integral to the group as Rosita. It makes as little sense as Sasha agreeing to Rosita's plan in the first place, when the sniper plan is so much better. And it just plain sucks that the better character is waltzing off to certain death, while one of the show's worst characters (at least lately) is safe.\\" He appreciated that Eugene turned out to be \\"the True Coward\\" rather than \\"a wolf in sheep's clothing.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Nick Romano gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade. He felt the moment where Sasha sacrificed herself and told Rosita to flee was a bit \\"forced\\" and felt that, \\"By all accounts, she seemed like she wanted to live.\\" He liked the bonding scene between Sasha and Rosita, and felt that, \\"A moment like this was needed for Rosita, who‚Äôs been frustrating to watch for some time as she makes reckless decision after reckless decision.\\" Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade. He commented that the episode \\"manages something I thought was nearly impossible at this point: it made me care about Rosita and Sasha‚Äôs friendship. Rosita‚Äôs become something of a drag of late, as her rage and self-loathing have made her tediously one note. Her interactions with Sasha, in which she never bothers to hide her resentment over Abraham, have been the worst of it. Sasha is less irritating, but she hasn‚Äôt had a lot to do other than mourn and plot revenge against Negan. Thankfully, by the end of this episode, both women felt a little closer to actual people again. It‚Äôs a simple trick‚Äîthey bond over attempted murder and a list of Rosita‚Äôs ex-boyfriends‚Äîbut an effective one.\\" However, he was critical of the timing it took to get to the emotional payoff of the episode. He praised Eugene's allegiance to Negan and its pay off, as well as Sasha's decision to leave Rosita behind, calling it a \\"nice twist\\" with \\"horrible, horrible consequences\\". Metros Adam Starkey praised the episode, calling it \\"an effectively emotional build with some standout performances\\", enjoying the comfort moments between Sasha and Rosita. Jacob Stolworthy of The Independent praised the episode. He said \\"what makes this episode work on a wavelength most episodes this season have failed to is through the weaving in of the very plot points the writers have taken time to flesh out; viewer‚Äôs patience continues to be rewarded. Take, for instance, both Sasha and Rosita - they‚Äôre both seeking to avenge the death of the man they both loved and, while this has made them more adversary than ally previously, we see them learn to find respect for each other with inevitable death approaching (more on that below).\\" He praised the scene between Daryl and Maggie, complimenting Reedus and Cohan's performances. Stolworthy also noted the impact of Sasha's decision to face Negan alone. He said, \\"In a series where the moustachioed soldier's death was - somewhat understandably - overshadowed by original character Glenn (Steven Yeun), this moment feels like the Abe tribute he's deserved for some time now.\\" Jeff Stone of IndieWire gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade. He felt that the episode was \\"an excuse to give Rosita some semblance of character development, something she‚Äôs been sorely lacking over her four seasons on the show. It‚Äôs also mostly set-up for a cliffhanger to lead us into the final two episodes. It‚Äôs serviceable on both counts.\\" He also questioned Sasha's actions, believing it to be \\"manufactured and under-motivated (like Morgan‚Äôs turn last episode), since Sasha never seemed to have much of a martyr complex, and her major character beat in the series so far was finding a way back from the brink after she became suicidal back in Season 5.\\" Noam Cohen of New York Observer was more negative of the episode, saying, \\"When it decides to slow down to give us character-centric vignettes, rather than letting their personalities and emotions emerge from their involvement in the plot, it starts to lag, and feel like a lot like filler.\\" =Ratings= The episode received a 4.7 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, with 10.32 million total viewers.

As the other Oceanside residents come to check the explosion, Rick's group holds them at gunpoint, explaining his plan to face the Saviors. Natania emerges with Tara, refusing to join them, but just then, a horde of walkers drawn by the blast appear. In the confusion, Cyndie (Sydney Park) subdues Natania with a punch to the face, freeing Tara from gunpoint. Rick efficiently leads both communities into quelling the horde, and Natania angrily concedes to Rick. Rick's group leaves with Oceanside's weapons and some of its survivors willing to help in the fight. At Hilltop, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) continues to take a strong leadership position, which Gregory (Xander Berkeley), its current leader, resents. When Maggie leaves the community to dig up a blueberry bush, Gregory follows her, and apologizes for his behavior towards her. He draws a knife to guard her while she digs up the bush, and contemplates using it on her. However, when walkers appear, he is unable to take action, and Maggie saves his life in time. At the Sanctuary, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) has been captured and placed in a cell. A Savior, David (Martinez), attempts to rape her, but Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) arrives just in time to stop the act and reminds David that rape is forbidden before killing him with a knife. Impressed with Sasha's bravery for attacking Sanctuary, Negan offers her his personal knife and gives her three options for it: kill him, commit suicide, or put down David's corpse before he re-animates as to join them as a Savior. After Negan leaves, Sasha is visited by Eugene (Josh McDermitt) who suggests she join the Saviors like he did, as they make him feel safe. Sasha decides to put down David, and when Negan next returns, tells him that he won before returning the knife. Negan informs her that he heard that Rick's group is up to no good and tomorrow will be a \\"big day\\". Distraught, Sasha pleads with Eugene to bring her a weapon, ostensibly so she can end her life. He brings her one of the poison capsules he previously made, leaving her disappointed. When Rick and the others return from Oceanside, Rosita (Christian Serratos) informs them they have a visitor: Dwight (Austin Amelio), one of Negan's former right-hand men. Daryl (Norman Reedus) attempts to attack him but Rick and the others hold him back, as Dwight begs that he wants to help them. Reception =Critical reception= Sonequa Martin-Green received praise for her performance as Sasha in this episode. \\"Something They Need\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 70% with an average rating of 6.34 out of 10, based on 33 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Something They Need\\" overcomes an uneven arc with humor, an upbeat pace, and a classic Walking Dead cliffhanger. Jeff Stone for IndieWire gave it a C+ moderately positive review, but felt it was mostly \\"perfunctory\\". He felt Sasha's storyline \\"is the only one with any current intrigue, and that‚Äôs mostly a coin flip to see if she‚Äôll live.\\" He also assessed that, \\"At least Sasha didn‚Äôt kill herself (yet) which would be a pretty depressing anti-climax.\\" The Independents Jacob Stolworthy was complimentary of the old-fashioned walker set-piece. He was disappointed with the show's decision not to show Sasha's infiltration and capture in the Sanctuary, and cutting to the aftermath (spoiled by the promotional stills of the following week). He also felt Sasha's death was inevitable and said, \\"...it's unfortunate then that, in one of the episode's most misjudged moments Sasha's big reveal is merely heard in favour of being shown from the viewpoint of Eugene who is listening outside the door. - something of a head-scratcher.\\" Josh Jackson noted the return of Tara in a central role as positive. He said, \\"...while Alanna Masterson hasn‚Äôt been the greatest actress to grace the zombie apocalypse, I can appreciate the everywoman-ness of our bumbling hero.\\" Shane Ryan felt he was \\"burned out\\" with the show. He was complimentary of the action at Oceanside, but levelled some criticisms. He assessed, \\"The plotting of it was bad, the execution was a little strange, but it was still fun because it stuck to the rules of what makes TWD good, on those rare occasions when it actually is.\\" Noel Murray for Rolling Stone was complimentary of the episode's table-setting. He said, \\"About two-thirds of the episode consists of the kind of long, dialectical scenes this show relies on far too often, as a way of killing time instead of walkers and creating the illusion of thematic depth. But here, these pieces serve more of a narrative purpose. And because they're divided across two locations, and broken up by some actually thrilling sequences elsewhere, the overall experience is more satisfying.\\" Sonequa Martin-Green's performance was praised. Josh Jackson felt unlike Masterson, \\"Sonequa Martin-Green, on the other hand, did a great job. I love the way she responded when Negan‚Äôs asked if Rick had put her up to the assassination attempt: ‚ÄúRick? Your bitch? No.‚Äù\\" Noel Murray for Rolling Stone said, \\"The often-underutilized and soon-to-be-Trekkie-fan-favorite Sonequa Martin-Green has been taking full advantage of her increased screen-time over the past two weeks; she does some of her best TWD work to date when Sasha ‚Äì who didn't die in her suicide raid ‚Äì sits locked in a Sanctuary cell, pondering her next move.\\" He went further on the Sasha storyline saying, \\"What's so remarkable about these interactions are the layers of emotions and motivations that Sasha cycles through, from fear and despair to a sense of hope when she realizes she can manipulate the mulleted gent into slipping her a weapon to \\"kill herself\\" ‚Äì which she hopes to use on the big man in charge.\\" Blair Marnell for CraveOnline felt that while it was likely it would be her final appearances on the show, they \\"have also been a gift to Martin-Green, as she‚Äôs never been more important to the series than she is now. In last week‚Äôs episode, Sasha had the really terrific bonding scene with Rosita. This week, Martin-Green carried most of her scenes with Negan and Eugene. She brought the life and fire to this episode, and the series will be poorer for her absence‚Ä¶ whenever it eventually comes. Some critics felt the characterization of the core group of survivors was off. Ron Hagan for Den of Geek! said, \\"Rick and Tara finally discuss the presence of the Seaside Motel group, and that means he's ready to go wage a full-fledged assault on a group of women and children, blowing up dynamite outside their walls, drawing the attention of zombies in the area, and then taking all their guns away to fight his own battle. And yes, that's the hero of the story.\\" He was relieved that the cliffhanger involving Sasha in the previous week was not stretched out to the finale. Zack Handlen for The A.V. Club had a similar perspective on raiding Oceanside and gave the episode a C+ grade. He said, \\"The fact that Tara not only signed off on this plan, but also seems to be one hundred percent behind it, is at odds with everything we know about her. However much she‚Äôs supposed to believe in Rick now (and clearly, she‚Äôs supposed to believe in him a lot), for her to willingly go in on such an openly aggressive scheme is bizarre. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to talk, and see what happens next.‚Äù This is ‚Äúwell, I have this hammer, so I guess this has to be another nail!‚Äù\\" Handlen overall assessed, \\"...we are forcibly reminded of The Walking Dead‚Äôs greatest weakness: Rick Must Always Be Right (except when he‚Äôs trying to fight against his destiny as a leader). The people of Oceanside almost immediately lose what little distinctive identity they once had, falling in line like they were just waiting for some bearded dude to show up and start ordering them around, and there‚Äôs no acknowledgement of the weirdness of this, of how close Rick‚Äôs tactics are to the very man he‚Äôs trying to destroy\\". =Ratings= The episode received a 4.9 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, with 10.54 million total viewers.

The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple, Angela Kang and Matthew Negrete, and directed by Greg Nicotero. In the episode, Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) comes to terms with the decision to commit suicide while in captivity in order to kill Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) reanimated. Brief flashbacks show her short-term relationship with Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and her friendship with Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as a reason to sacrifice herself to protect her friends. Further storylines include the start of the build-up to the All Out War arc with the various aligning survivor communities facing off against Negan and the Saviors. This episode marked Sonequa Martin-Green's final regular appearance in the series as Sasha Williams. Cudlitz reprised his role as Abraham in flashbacks. Khary Payton, Steven Ogg, Katelyn Nacon and Pollyanna McIntosh reappeared as guest stars, before being upgraded to series regulars for the eighth season. This episode was also dedicated in memory of American comic artist Bernie Wrightson, who died on March 18, 2017. The episode received positive reviews from critics. Plot At Alexandria, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his allies question Dwight (Austin Amelio), who warns them that Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has captured Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) and is preparing a major attack. Dwight offers to help stall them, while Rick sends word to Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) and the Scavengers that their help is needed. At the Sanctuary, Sasha convinces Negan to kill only one Alexandrian instead of three for their transgressions, and agrees to help in his plan. Negan has Sasha secured in a casket on a truck as the rest of the Saviors prepare to march. Eugene (Josh McDermitt) provides Sasha with an iPod and some water before the casket is closed. During the trip, Sasha struggles to maintain consciousness, and has daydreams of Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan). The Saviors encounter a roadblock setup by Dwight, giving time for the Alexandrians and Scavengers to take defensive positions. Negan taunts them, and at his word, Jadis and the Scavengers turn their weapons on the Alexandrians, revealing the Saviors offered them a better deal. Negan orders Sasha's casket brought forward, offering Rick that he will let Sasha live if Alexandria surrenders and turns over all its possessions. Rick demands to see Sasha, and Negan goes ahead to open the casket. A flashback shows Sasha took the suicide pill Eugene had given her the day before after the casket was closed. Now a walker, Sasha attacks Negan, and the distraction allows the Alexanderians to fight against the Saviors and Scavengers, however, they are still outnumbered. As Negan prepares to kill Carl in front of Rick, the combined forces of the Kingdom and Hilltop led by King Ezekiel (Khary Payton) and Maggie arrive and fend off the Saviors and Scavengers. Negan is furious to see Maggie still alive. Rick races to find Michonne (Danai Gurira) still alive having battled a Savior to death. When the Saviors regroup at Sanctuary, Negan asks Eugene how Sasha could have died, and he suggests she may have died from suffocation in the casket. Negan remains doubtful but accepts the answer, and tells the Saviors to prepare for war. At Alexandria, the combined group mourn their losses including Sasha's sacrifice. Daryl (Norman Reedus) finds a note from Dwight that he was unaware of the Scavengers' betrayal. Rick, Maggie, and Ezekiel agree to combine their forces in war against the Saviors. Production Sonequa Martin-Green made her final regular appearance as Sasha Williams in this episode The finale marks Sonequa Martin-Green's final regular appearance as Sasha Williams, having been on the show since the season three episode \\"Made to Suffer.\\" The death is a remix of the character Holly from the comic book, however there are some significant differences. Scott M. Gimple stated on Talking Dead that ‚ÄúIt was always about Sasha not being a victim. She had wanted a weapon from Eugene. She wanted a knife. She didn‚Äôt get one, so she became the knife.‚Äù Martin-Green explained Sasha's decision to sacrifice herself and felt that it was ‚Äúright and complete‚Äù. She said, ‚ÄúIt was quite poetic [...] it was the perfect end to my story, the perfect culmination of my life. I felt like all of my roads had led to that moment of getting to that place of complete selflessness. Also, it was beautiful because the way I saw it, that warrior spirit lives on. That even in death, I was still going to fight, because I had realized my purpose. It had been revealed to me. Everything before that had been self-preservation, self-defense mechanisms, basically self-obsession. And over the course of my life as Sasha, it was progressing beyond that to the point that I said, ‚ÄòO.K., I now have a greater purpose that is much bigger than me, that‚Äôs for the future, and I‚Äôm going to do it even in death.‚Äô‚Äù Michael Cudlitz appears in a cameo in this episode in a flashback sequence Speculation had arisen over Martin-Green leaving the show to play the role of Michael Burnham on Star Trek: Discovery. However, she dismissed these claims and said, \\"...what was happening on Walking Dead was already underway. It was the path. It was definitely in place. And then as we were going into the very end of the season, the very end of our shoot for the season --- that's when the opportunity for Star Trek came. And so I know some people might think that I left Walking Dead to do Star Trek, but it did not happen that way. It was after Walking Dead was already ending that the opportunity for Star Trek came.\\" Martin-Green said she was aware of the death of Sasha for a while, though was unaware of the details \\"until a few weeks before\\". She said, \\"I didn't know it would be the suicide pill and the Negan of it all. What Scott did tell me is that it would be heroic and sacrificial and that it would be perfect end to the story. He'd thought about it for a long time and had a vision of it for a very long time.\\" Although Tyreese is not mentioned, Sasha's death serves as a parallel to her brother's death scene in the fifth season episode \\"What Happened and What's Going On\\". Both episodes begin with a flashforward of the deaths (although this is not known until the end of the episode) and feature re-appearances of dead characters, as well as the episode titles referencing time. Reception =Critical reception= \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an 83% with an average rating of 7.5 out of 10, based on 40 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"The First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\" overcomes sporadic doldrums with an action-packed battle sequence, satisfying and innovative storytelling, and impressively imaginative use of a tiger. Jeff Stone of IndieWire gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and summarized it saying, \\"The Season 7 finale is poorly paced, but has enough thrills to get by.\\" Stone appreciated that Sasha \\"went out fighting in her own way\\" but was highly critical of Negan saying, \\"Negan proves he‚Äôs still the dumbest villain of all time, because even after all that, he refuses to kill Rick.\\" He criticized Maggie's ending speech and called it \\"repetitive and sappy\\". Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush gave the episode a positive review saying, \\"It‚Äôs a strong finish to an otherwise uneven season that already alienated many viewers with its premiere, and I appreciate the level of artistry on display in smaller moments like the callback to Sasha and Maggie watching the sunset, or that closing montage. The Walking Dead could use more episodes operating on this frequency, and I suspect there‚Äôs lessons to be learned here. Blair Marnell of CraveOnline felt the episode \\"gave Sasha a memorable send off‚Ä¶and then it just kept on giving it to her. The intercutting between Sasha‚Äôs dream reunion with Abe, her time with Negan and Eugene, and her final moments in the coffin was an interesting way to chronicle the last hours of her life. But it went on for far too long.\\" Overall, she noted the slow pacing and filler episodes of the season and felt \\"it robbed the series of its urgency\\". On the upcoming war, she assessed, \\"In theory, the ‚ÄúAll Out War‚Äù storyline could and should be more intense, but this show's recent history suggests that its approach isn't going to change. Eventually, the audience's willingness to put up with the sluggish pace will catch up with this series. Given the declining ratings, it's possible that it's already started to happen. The Walking Dead has pulled off some amazing feats over the last seven seasons, but even this show can't last forever.\\" Stuart Jeffries of The Guardian called it \\"a satisfyingly gaudy ending, with mobile caskets, shots to the gut and the return of Shiva the almighty CGI tiger.\\" Kevin Yeoman of Screen Rant felt the episode was \\"a drag\\" but assessed that Sasha's death served as the episode's highlight. He went further saying, \\"Her plan, to become a spring-loaded zombie in Negan‚Äôs coffin [...] worked like a charm and the episode‚Äôs technique of filling the frame with Sonequa Martin-Green‚Äôs face while she listened to some Donny Hathaway and reminisced about Abraham set the tone for her departure and suggested that even with the loss everything would be okay. Surprisingly, that‚Äôs where ‚ÄòThe First Day of the Rest of Your Life‚Äô excelled. At making one character's death feel like it meant something after so many of them have increasingly felt like distractions from a go-nowhere plot. In the end, Sasha's death also provided a necessary distraction, one that let Rick and his crew turn the tables on the duplicitous Jadis and her junkyard kids, and finally push back against the bully in the schoolyard. It's just too bad the rest of the hour wasn't as effective as losing Sasha.\\" Elise Nakhnikian of Slant Magazine was critical of the ending but praised Sasha's scenes. She assessed the ending as a whole, \\"...it was disappointing when the season ended with another inconclusive skirmish between the Saviors and Alexandrians. True, this latest attempt at rebellion was a different order of magnitude than any of their earlier clashes: a de facto declaration of war. But it was so badly botched that it did little to change the balance of power, functioning mainly as a prolonged teaser for the battle that will follow (if the TV gods have any mercy) in season eight.\\" Nakhnikian felt Sasha's subplot gave the \\"most emotionally engaging moments, as it did in ‚ÄúSomething They Need.‚Äù She assessed that, \\"The irony of her entering a casket so fully alive and coming out of it (un)dead is poignant, and the initial challenge of figuring out what's happening in her scenes is intriguing, as close-ups of her sorrowful face in the dark give way to flashbacks to her conversation with Abraham and occasional shots of her sitting quietly on a bench next to Maggie. Unlike Maggie's final voiceover about the power of the community Rick's group has established, which tells us nothing we don't already know in language too pedestrian to stir any emotion, Sasha's story resonates, letting us mourn the loss of a character whose best epitaph is delivered by Negan: ‚ÄúYou are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddam fool.‚Äù =Ratings= The episode received a 5.4 rating in the key 18-49 demographic, with 11.31 million total viewers.

The Convento de San Pedro M√°rtir, is a convent located in Toledo (Castile-La Mancha, Spain). The Dominican convent was moved in 1407 from its location outside the walls to the houses donated by Do√±a Guiomar de Meneses. through its successive extensions and modifications, became one of the richest and most important convents of the city. The convent, of enormous dimensions, is organized around three courtyards: The one closest to the entrance is denominated \\"Real\\"; The smallest is called the \\"Silencio\\", and the one of the \\"Naranjos\\" or the \\"Procesiones\\" is located on the side of the epistle of the church.  History and description  Garcilaso de la Vega The cloister called \\"Silencio\\" is the oldest of all and possibly corresponds to a civil construction that was later encompassed in the convent. It has three floors. The low with semicircular arches that rest on columns. Pointed arches appear in the north stretch. Columns and capitals of marble, of great bill, pointed to an Italian origin. The second floor is formed by recessed arches that lean on columns very similar to the lower ones. The cloister of the \\"Silencio\\" contrasts with the \\"Real\\", of much greater size, that began to build with traces of Covarrubias, in 1541, by his disciple Hern√°n Gonz√°lez de Lara. It consists of three floors entirely built of stone. The low floor is composed of semicircular arches that rest on columns. The architectural elements used- slate mirrors in the wainscots, balusters, etc., are the usual in Covarrubias in other works of the moment. Of these same dates is the door that gives access to the convent from the street of San Pedro M√°rtir, that formerly was the main entrance. The cloister of the \\"Naranjos\\", also called the \\"Procesiones\\", underwent a complete transformation in the middle of the 18th century and has reached us with a first floor of arches recessed on columns. Nicol√°s de Vergara el Mozo was in charge of carrying out the works of the new church and the sacristy. This one began to be constructed in 1587 and it is composed of two spaces: The greater, rectangular, is the one that really serves as sacristy, and another, square, houses a small chapel. The walls of the two spaces are formed by arches with niches, which achieves a greater unity between both. Among the arches are erected Doric pilasters with their corresponding entablature running, which also serves as an element of union between the two spaces. The larger space is covered with a flat, fluted and lunished vaulted ceiling. The most direct access from the church to the sacristy is through a door located at one end of the major side. There is the chapel of Santa In√©s, whose Gothic architecture, with vaulted edges, contains several interesting sepulchers. The works of the present church began in 1605 with traces and conditions of Nicol√°s de Vergara el Mozo. Two years later, Vergara died, Juan Bautista Monegro took over the work. Its plant is of three naves, with choir in high and flat presbytery, with two side chapels. The naves are separated by three arches with Doric pilasters that support the entablature, on top of which a barrel vault rises. A beautiful fence of beginnings of the 17th century separates the presbytery from the croisser. The exterior door of the church, Monegro's work, highlights the magnificent Mud√©jar tower of the neighboring church of San Rom√°n. Treated in stone, it contrasts not only with the tower but also with the masonry wall of the church proper. The design of the cover reveals the activity of Monegro as a retablist and his relations with Herrerian architecture. The main theme is the triumphal arch that develops in his lower body. The upper one is formed by a small temple, with the sculpture of the titular saint on a basement running. On top of this, two pyramids are also raised with a ball. In the upper part of the facade there are two windows of very simple trace that serve to illuminate the entrance hall.  Headquarters  In the years 1992-1993 important works of remodeling and integration of the convent were realized within the new structures of the University of Castilla-La Mancha, exposing parts of the subsoil of the primitive constructions. it has been operating as the university headquarters of the Faculty of Juridical and Social Sciences of Toledo.

Archdale was the Sheffield branch organiser for the Women's Social and Political Union and later its prisoners' secretary in London. Active during the First World War, Archdale initiated a training farm for women agricultural workers in 1914. In 1917 she served as a clerical worker with Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps, transferring in 1918 to the women's department of the Ministry of National Service.  Biography  Archdale was born at Nenthorn, Berwickshire to Helen Evans (n√©e Carter) (1834‚Äì1903), one of the Edinburgh Seven, the first group of women to enroll at a British university, and Alexander Russel (1814‚Äì1876), a Scottish journalist and editor of The Scotsman. Archdale was educated at St Leonard's School, St Andrews, then at the University of St Andrews (1893‚Äì1894), where she was one of the first women undergraduates. In 1901 she married Captain Theodore Montgomery Archdale who was stationed in India. Not much is known of her time in India. On returning to Scotland in 1908, she immediately joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), becoming its Sheffield branch organiser in 1910, employed Adele Pankhurst as live-in governess and in 1911 moving to London and taking up the position of prisoners' secretary. Archdale also worked as a writer and journalist. She worked in various capacities on the WSPU's publications The Suffragette from October 1912, and from 1915 she wrote for its successor, Britannia. She was the first editor of the political and literary weekly review Time & Tide (with the unspoken subtext 'wait for no man'), founded in 1920 by Margaret Rhondda. In the 1930s she contributed articles to The Times, Daily News, Christian Science Monitor, and The Scotsman. During the First World War, she was active in multiple positions, including at the Women's Department of the Ministry of National Service in the last year of the war. She started a training farm for women agricultural workers, served as a clerical worker with Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps from 1917, and in 1918 worked in the women's department of the Ministry of National Service.  Political life  Meeting of Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) leaders, Flora Drummond, Christabel Pankhurst, Annie Kenny, Emmeline Pankhurst, Charlotte Despard with two others. 1906 ‚Äì 1907 Archdale took part in a WSPU demonstration in Edinburgh on 9 October 1909. Later that month she was arrested with Hannah Mitchell, Adela PankhurstPankhurst, Spartacus, 9 March 2017 and Maud Joachim and Catherine Corbett in Dundee. They were convicted of breach of the peace after interrupting a meeting being held by the local MP, Winston Churchill, at which women had been excluded. Following their arrest, on 20 October, all went on hunger strike and were released after four days of the ten days imprisonment. The prison governor and medical supervisor assessed that due to her 'configuration' Archdale 'would be particularly difficult to feed forcibly'. In December 1911 Archdale received a sentence of two months' imprisonment for window-breaking at Whitehall. Her daughter, Betty Archdale (1907-2000), remembered collecting stones for her mother to use, and visiting her in Holloway Prison. Archdale was the secretary, and later international secretary, of the Six Point Group, founded by Margaret Rhondda. The group's six aims were: In 1926 Archdale and Rhondda founded the Open Door Council with Chrystal Macmillan and Elizabeth Abbott. The Open Door Council was created to promote equal economic opportunities for women with a focus on economic emancipation. It opposed the extension of protective legislation for women, regarding such legislation as restrictive, and arguing that it effectively barred women from better-paid jobs such as mining. Archdale was also active in the international version, Open Door International, founded in 1929 with Chrystal Macmillan serving as president. In 1927 Archdale began working in Geneva, lobbying for an Equal Rights Treaty at the League of Nations in the early 1930s. The League was the first international organisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. She became secretary of the Liaison Committee of Women's International Organisations, created in 1931 as a coalition to promote equal rights, disarmament and women's representation at the League. From 1929 to 1934 she worked to chair Equal Rights International, founded at The Hague, an organisation dedicated to promoting campaigning for equality of women with men in law and in the workplace. In the late 1930s she was associated with the World Women's Party.  Personal life  On 9 October 1901 Archdale married Captain, later Lieutenant-Colonel, Theodore Montgomery Archdale (1875‚Äì1918), who at the time was stationed in India. She spent her early married life in Lancashire and India. The couple had two sons and one daughter. Archdale appears to have been estranged from her husband from about 1913. According to her biographer, David Doughan, she had a relationship with Lady Margaret Rhondda: \\"By the early 1920s, she was sharing an apartment, and, together with her family, a country house (Stonepits, Kent) with Lady Rhondda\\".

The bill would also have reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through 2019. The bill passed the House House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee but died before reaching a full House floor vote. Because bills do not carry over into the next Congress, Shuster reintroduced an updated version of the bill in the 115th Congress on June 22, 2017. The subsequent bill is H.R. 2997, the 21st Century Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act.\\"H.R.2997 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): 21st Century AIRR Act\\". Congress.gov. Published by the Library of Congress. Retrieved 2017-08-24. his bill also has never reached a floor vote. In the spring of 2016, the Senate passed and the President signed into law a separate piece of legislation which was a short term reauthorization of the FAA. This reauthorization expires in September 2017. In 2017, House and Senate Transportation Committees began to hold hearings on the status of the airline sector (such as infrastructure and safety) in pursuit of a multi-year authorization. A priority for long-term authorization from House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Shuster is the privatization of air traffic controllers. In the short-term reauthorization passed in 2016, the privatization component‚Äîa major component of Shuster's H.R. 4441‚Äîwas not included.  Background  In the United States, the aviation industry helps drive the national economy. The industry employee millions of people and accounts for over 5% of GDP. The American aviation system is the busiest in the world and continues growing. With the size and scope of the American aviation system, the air traffic control system \\"still utilizes World War II-era radar technology.‚Äù According to the House Transportation Committee, ‚ÄúWe have an antiquated, inefficient air traffic control system. Bureaucracy hinders our manufacturers‚Äô ability to compete and threatens to drive jobs in new technologies ‚Äì like drones ‚Äì overseas. And Americans are growing weary of delays and hassles associated with flying.‚Äù\\"21st Century AIRR Act packet\\" . U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Retrieved 2017-08-24. = Air traffic control system reform = The United States‚Äô Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is a division of the Federal Aviation Administration and a unit of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The ATO is the operational arm of the FAA responsible for safe and efficient air navigation. It oversees 17 percent of the world's airspace: the entire United States plus large parts of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The idea to spin off air traffic control from a government agency to an independent, non-governmental body is modeled after Canada's reforms from two decades ago. Under the reform model, a board of stakeholders would oversee the body and would charge user fees instead of aviation taxes. Canada's system is regarded as one of the most efficient and advanced air navigation service providers in the world. Air traffic control costs 26 percent more in the United States than it does in Canada. The FAA's ‚ÄúNextGen‚Äù program is replacing aging equipment. ATC reform would replace the actual system, how it is organized, and who oversees it. An Inspector General report released in January 2017 restarted the debate over moving ATC from FAA to a private corporation governed by the airline industry. Congress must renew the short-term FAA authorization that expires on September 30, 2017, and this issue will be part of the debate. Several events in the past have highlighted need for reform. For example, in September 2014 arson brought down a regional facility in Chicago, which disrupted airline flights for several weeks. In October 2015 the radar room in the tower at Austin- Bergstrom airport flooded. According to UPI, ‚ÄúThe Federal Aviation Administration has long maintained control over air traffic control at the nation's airports due to the sensitive nature of the work and the government's desire to prevent private airlines from competing for space, potentially complicating travel time and creating a safety hazard.‚Äù In February 2017, the Eno Center for Transportation released the report Time for Reform: Delivering Modern Air Traffic Control. The report recommends moving ATC from FAA to either a government corporation or an independent nonprofit organization. The report also proposes changing the funding structure to user fees rather than mix of taxes and general Treasury funds. According to the Eno Center, ‚ÄúThe report finds that spinning-off air traffic control would create a more stable system that the current one, which is subject to political uncertainty. A separate system would not depend on annual budget appropriations, nor subject to budget sequesters and government shutdowns. In the long run this will make running ATC cheaper, providing benefits for the economy and the travelling public.‚Äù = History and opposition = The air traffic control program is \\"an issue with enormous economic consequences that impacts every American regardless of how often they fly.\\" The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is a Washington-based organization lobbies on behalf of the interests of private and corporate jet owners. Drew Johnson, a senior fellow at the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, wrote in an opinion editorial in the Huffington Post that the NBAA \\"is the reason why the nation‚Äôs air traffic control system is so antiquated and incapable of keeping pace with the modern demands of air travel that it accounts for nearly half of all flight delays.\\" In 1993, President Bill Clinton was the first to suggest major reform of the ATC system. He recommended the creation of an independent entity to manage the nation's ATC system. To date, major editorial boards (including the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post) have endorsed the idea. President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee have all publicly supported it, as well. Additionally, \\"Former Secretaries of Transportation and FAA leaders from the Clinton, Bush, and Obama administration ‚Äì including all three former heads of the U.S. air traffic control system ‚Äì support ATC reform,‚Äù according to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. \\"Even though there are far more general aviation aircraft, including corporate and private jet, than commercial planes using America‚Äôs airways, corporate jet owners pay only about 1 percent into the ATC system.\\"  Legislative details  = Privatization of FAA activities and air traffic control = The AIRR Act would remove air traffic control from the federal government and place it into a ‚Äúfederally- chartered, not-for-profit corporation called the ATC Corporation‚Äù on October 1, 2019. This move would transfer all operational control over air traffic services from FAA to the new corporation. FAA employees, property, and facilities would be transferred to ATC, as well as operational control of FAA air traffic services. When Congressman Shuster announced the introduction of the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act, he said that the ATC system is incredibly inefficient and will just get worse as the number of people flying goes up and the FAA falls further behind in modernization. = Other provisions = In addition to privatizing ATC, the bill has a number of other provisions: * It keeps the FAA's role as the country's main aviation safety regulator. * It creates: ** A Safety Oversight and Certification Advisory Committee within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) ** An FAA Task Force on Flight Standards Reform ** A Regional Consistency Communications Board ** A Designated Agency Safety and Health Officer within DOT ** An Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration Office within the FAA ** A UAS detection systems pilot program * It directs: ** The FAA to create a safety workforce training strategy ** The DOT to take actions to ‚Äúpromote U.S. aerospace standards, products, and services abroad‚Äù ** The DOT to create a plan to quicken the pace of integrating civil drones into the national airspace system ** The FAA to submit to Congress a strategic cybersecurity plan * It reauthorizes the essential air service program and small community air service development program for fiscal years 2016 to 2022.  Cosponsors  In addition to the original cosponsor (Frank LoBiondo), the bill was cosponsored by four additional Members of Congress: * Mimi Walters (R-CA) * Jeff Denham (R-CA) * Richard Hanna (R-NY) * Pete Sessions (R-TX)  Legislative history  The following shows the legislative history of the Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act: * 2/3/16 ‚Äì The bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and referred to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure * 2/4/16 ‚Äì The committee referred it to the Subcommittee on Aviation. * 2/11/16 ‚Äì The committee considered and amended (‚Äúmarked up‚Äù) the bill. * 2/11/16 ‚Äì The bill was ordered to be reported favorably from the committee by a vote of 32-26. The Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2016 (H.R.4721) was a separate bill introduced by Congressman Shuster on March 10, 2016. It did not include the privatization of air traffic controllers due to opposition in the Senate. On March 30, 2016, after being signed by President Obama it became Public Law 114-141.https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4721?r=1 The bill was a short-term reauthorization of the FAA that expires on September 30, 2017.  Support and opposition  = Support = The bill has substantial bipartisan support in Congress and in the stakeholder community (such as airlines). Many airlines have said that privatizing ATC would be more efficient, cheaper and reduce flight delays. Airlines for America, the trade association representing airlines, supports the privatization of air traffic control. The group wrote, ‚ÄúThe flying and shipping public deserve modernized air traffic control infrastructure. Unnecessary flight delays that are often the result of outdated, WWII-era technology and procedures cost the United States an estimated $25 billion in 2016 alone. Benefits of modernization will include: enhanced safety, reduced delays, fuel savings, reduced emissions, increased capacity and greater operational efficiency.‚Äù = Opposition = Members of the House and Senate Appropriations committees oppose the proposal because it would reduce their own oversight authority. The same is true for some members of the House Ways and Means Committee; it would take away their role in setting aviation taxes and fees. On February 15, 2016, the New York Times‚Äôs editorial board published an article, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Privatize Air Traffic Control.‚Äù Most of the general aviation(GA) community strongly oppose privatizing air traffic control. Citing a similar switch Canada made in 1996(NavCanada), the high fees associated with a private air traffic control in Canada resulted in a significant decline in the GA community. Flying in Canada with anything other than a major airline has become a privilege of the rich.  115th Congress (2017-2018)  Although all bills officially die at the end of a two-year congressional term, Shuster has kept the issue alive when the 115th Congress began. In January 2017 at the start of the 115th Congress, Shuster began to fight again for a new version of his bill and the privatization of ATC. On February 9, 2017, President Donald Trump met with airline and airport executives at the White House to discuss transportation issues. Trump told the attendees that he supports privatizing the ATC system. Trump called the current system too expensive and ‚Äútotally out of whack‚Äù during the meeting. ‚ÄúTrump pledged he would review regulations on the airline industry and work to provide better infrastructure at the nation's airports.‚Äù Also on February 9, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved a bill that would again shift the entire ATC system to a stand-alone, nonprofit corporation. The bill would reauthorize the FAA for three years. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bill faces ‚Äúan uncertain fate in the Senate‚Äù. Under the bill, the FAA would retain final say over all safety matters. Additionally, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held a series of hearings about FAA reform. In February 2017, the Subcommittee on Aviation held a hearing entitled ‚ÄúBuilding a 21st Century Infrastructure for America: State of American Airports.‚Äù That was the subcommittee's second hearing examining aviation issues in anticipation of the 2017 FAA reauthorization bill. = The 21st Century AIRR Act (2017) = The official logo of The 21st Century AIRR Act published by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (U.S. Government) On June 22, 2017, Shuster reintroduced an updated version of the bill, H.R. 2997, the 21st Century AIRR Act. On June 27, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held a markup (a process where a bill is debated, amended, and voted on in a congressional committee) on the bill and it passed by a vote of 32 to 25.‚ÄúActions - H.R. 2997 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): 21st Century AIRR Act‚Äù. Congress.gov. Published by the Library of Congress. Retrieved 2017-08-24. H.R. 2997 would create a federally chartered, fully independent, not-for-profit organization whose mission would be to operate and modernize the country's air traffic control (ATC) services. The organization would be the service provider for ATC services instead of the FAA. Essentially, the legislation would separate the service provider for air traffic control from the FAA (its regulating agency). The reason to separate the two is to allow the air traffic control system, under the newly created oversight organization, to be free from \\"the government‚Äôs inherent bureaucratic inertia, Washington politics, and funding uncertainty.‚Äù The new service provider (the not-for-profit organization created by the bill) would be run like a business. It would have a CEO who would be accountable to a board of directors, which would be made up of people nominated from each significant sub-industry of aviation (general aviation, cargo aviation, commercial, etc.). The bill would transition the ATC system to the new service provider over a three-year transition period. It is important to note that the FAA would remain responsible for the safety of the country's sovereign airspace and would be able to regulate the service provider \\"at arm‚Äôs length as in most other modern countries worldwide.‚Äù The Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the cost of this new bureaucracy at $20 billion over the first ten years. This figure was subsequently revised upward to $98.5 billion. The bill did not have adequate support in Congress, and Representative Bill Shuster has stated that he will no longer pursue it.

He thereby became the first to complete the formal esoterization of Japanese Tendai.  Biography  Information about Annen‚Äôs life is sparse. Annen notes of himself that he originally came from the same clan as Saich≈ç. At the age of nineteen, Annen was ordained as a Tendai monk, studying under the Tendai priest Ennin (hyperlink). He did not travel to China for study despite plans to do so, and never became head abbot (zasu Â∫ß‰∏ª) of Mt. Hiei. There are disputes as to whether he completed the 12-year training at Mt. Hiei. In 884, Annen received the Dharma transmission from Tendai master Henj≈ç (ÈÅçÁÖß). He was appointed abbot of Ganky≈çji (ÂÖÉÊÖ∂ÂØ∫) in 890, succeeding Henj≈ç. Aside other teachers such as Tenkei and Enchin, Henjo was especially influential in Annen‚Äôs development, since he provided Annen access to all significant Taimitsu doctrinal and ritual teachings. Little is known about Annen‚Äôs activities after 889 (age 49); the year in which Annen died is also contested. Scholarship places the date between 887 and 889 Additionally, there are later stories which give an account of Annen‚Äôs retreat into a state of infinite meditation in a cave in the year 915. These stories are similar to the accounts given of the monk K≈´kai (Á©∫Êµ∑). Annen was succeeded by Genjo ÁéÑÁ†∞, (who was not certified due to Annen‚Äôs death), Daie (Â§ßÊÖß), and Son‚Äôi (Â∞äÊÑè).  Writings  Annen was a prolific writer during his time; forty (out of the supposed more than one hundred) of his works are extant, although in some cases their authorship is dubious. The most important works delineating his doctrine are Shingonsh≈´ ky≈çjigi (ÁúüË®ÄÂÆóÊïôÊôÇÁæ©, \\"On the Meaning of Teachings and Times in Esoteric Buddhism\\") and the Taiz≈çkong≈ç bodaishingi ryaku mond≈çsh≈ç (ËÉéËîµÈáëÂâõËè©ÊèêÂøÉÁæ©Áï•ÂïèÁ≠îÊäÑ, \\"Abbreviated Discussion on the Meaning of Bodhicitta according to the Womb and Diamond [Realities]\\") He also wrote extensively on the precepts and ordination of the Ritsury≈ç system. His writings have value beyond the school of Taimitsu due to the vast scope of esoteric material included in his scholarship.  Doctrine  Annen‚Äôs goal was to unite the various taimitsu doctrines of the contemporary Tendai school into one ‚Äútrue‚Äù esotericism that would encompass sectarian divisions and even the totality of the Buddhist experience. He presented a theory known as the ‚Äúfour ones‚Äù (shiichi ky≈çhan Âõõ‰∏ÄÊïôÂà§), in which he stated that the Shingon view of the world consisted of one buddha, one time, one place, and one teaching. He thereby affirmed the suchness of all phenomena, and provided an absolute reading which encompassed all relative theories of Buddhist doctrines. He also reinterpreted the precepts of the Tendai school in light of esoteric teachings. In the Futsu jubosatsukai koshaku (ÊôÆÈÄöÊéàËè©Ëñ©ÊàíÂ∫ÉÈáà ), Annen argued for a more lenient attitude towards monks who violated the precepts, arguing for instance that the transgressions should be considered in the context of the person‚Äôs whole life, and that the precepts could be violated for certain reasons. Scholarship suggests that Annen‚Äôs attitude towards the precepts was due to witnessing his master, Tankei‚Äôs violations of laws of sexual conduct, and subsequent defrocking. Additionally, it has been argued that Annen‚Äôs treatise contributed considerably to the decline of monastic discipline in the Tendai school.

This links transduction technologies (electrochemistry, optics, ultrasound) with synthetic biology and nanomaterials to achieve sensors and diagnostic systems. The research bridges theoretical methods and modelling with lab-based experimental science.\\" Hall is particularly interested in biosensors and the idea of 'the measured self', as well as other measure environment from the molecular level to a whole system (living or abiotic). She has a special interest in diagnostics for low and middle income countries. Hall (2016) writes: > [The use of biosensors] might involve connecting electrochemistry with an > engineered enzyme and some neat signal processing to make glucose monitoring > easier and cheaper for diabetics; it could be that we are using synthetic > biology to design and produce new silk-like materials that change colour > when they encounter bacteria; we might be taking inspiration from biology to > modify electrodes so that they can respond to our personal environment: the > room we are in, our breath, our activities.

The British Royal Navy captured her in 1779 and took her into service under her existing name. It sold her in 1799. Origin and capture Pilote was commissioned in Dunkirk in March 1779 under Captain Denys. She was valued at 58,700 livres tournois. On 2 October 1779, captured two French cutters, each of 14 guns and 120 men. One was Mutin, under the command of Chevalier de Roquefeiul. She was pierced for 16 guns but carried 14, either 4 or 6-pounders. The other was Pilote, under the command of Chevalier de Clonard. She carried the same armament as Mutine (or Mutin). The cutters surrendered after an engagement that left Mutin dismasted. The Royal Navy took both into service essentially under their existing names. Jupiter shared the prize money with Apollo, , and . HMS Pilote underwent fitting at Plymouth between 28 March and 12 July 1780. Lieutenant Richard Boger commissioned her in May for the Irish Sea. She shared with and in the proceeds of the capture on 24 December of the Dutch vessel Vryhied. That same day and the day before, Pilote was in company with Rattlesnake and they shared in the proceeds of the capture of Jussrow Johanna, Adriana, and Vrow Maria. Pilote shared with a number of other vessels in the proceeds of the taking of the Union American, and the retaking of the brig Industry. In April 1781 Pilote was at Plymouth again where she underwent copper sheathing. In 1781 Pilote captured the Dutch vessel Linderbloom. Pilote was under the command of Lieutenant Charles Seymour Lynn on 5 December 1782 when she captured the Dutch ship Fortun√©e. She was paid off in May 1783 and then Lynn recommissioned her. Between 1786 and 1787 Pilote was under the command of Lieutenant Warwick Oben. From 1791 she was still in the Irish Sea and under the command of Lieutenant Henry Gunter. In March 1793 she was driven on shore at Waterford from her moorings.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ2486, 8 March 1793. Between June and July 1794 Pilote was yet again at Plymouth undergoing work, this time for conversion to a brig. Pilote was under the command of Lieutenant Jackson Dowsing when she captured the French vessel Maria Theresa. Pilote was among the many vessels that benefited from the proceeds of the Dutch men of war, East Indiamen, and other merchant vessels that the navy seized at Plymouth on 20 January 1795. In 1795 Pilote was under the command of Lieutenant Farmery Predam Epworth. While in Pilote he carried dispatches to the West Indies and the Channel Fleet. He received promotion to Commander in in December 1796.Marshall (1825), vol.2, part 2, p.563. In 1797 she was under the command of Lieutenant Henry Compton. On 26 May she captured the French privateer lugger Justine Ad√©la√Øde. Pilote had seen a convoy safely to St Helens when she encountered and captured Justine Ad√©la√Øde ten leagues SSE from Beachy Head. Justine Ad√©la√Øde mounted two guns and two swivel guns, carried a chest of small arms, and had a crew of 20 men. She was three days out of Fecamp, but had taken nothing. On 12 July Pilote captured the Danish ship Emilie, and her cargo. In June 1798 Pilote recaptured the brig Amity. On 28 June Pilote was in company with the 50-gun fourth rate , , and , also later , and possibly the 24-gun post ship , when they fell in with a Swedish convoy of 21 merchant vessels and their escort, a 44-gun frigate. Because Sweden and Britain were not at war, Captain Lawford of Romney shadowed the convoy while sending a lieutenant back to the Admiralty for instructions. On 30 June the lieutenant returned, but his instructions are now lost. Lawford decided to detain the Swedish merchant vessels, which he did on 1 and 2 July, without the Swedish frigate intervening. Ultimately, the Swedish vessels sailed into Margate where they were held for some months before the authorities sent most on their way.Debritt (1801), pp.4-8.

Family Otto Metzger was the son of Jewish parents: Ludwig Metzger (18521931) and Gretchen (Guldmann) (18641943). He grew up in Nuremberg, Germany, where he met his wife, Sophie (Josephthal) (18941998). First World War Otto Metzger had previously served as a reserve officer in the Bavarian Engineers and so, at the outbreak of the First World War, he was immediately conscripted. He served in the Imperial German Army on the Western Front, and rose to the rank of lieutenant, and was awarded Iron Cross medals (1st and 2nd class). Engineering career in Germany After his early schooling at the Neues Gymnasium in Nuremberg, he continued his studies at the Technical University of Munich, and obtained a Diplom-Ingenieur degree in mechanical engineering at the Berlin-Charlottenburg Technical Academy. Otto Metzger then spent several years travelling and gaining engineering experience both in Germany, and also in Austria, France, Britain, USA and in Mexico. On his return to Nuremberg in 1912, he took a post with a local metals company, Schmidtmer & Co, first as an engineer, and then becoming a partner. After the First World War, he returned to his previous work; the company (then called S√ºddeutsche Metallindustrie) was taken over by Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke AG in 1926, and in 1930 became a subsidiary of the conglomerate Metallindustrie AG. He was to stay with that company in various engineering and management positions until 1938, during which time he developed and patented inventions related to impact- extrusion of zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals. Typical products for these patents were seamless cans for zinc-carbon batteries, brass shell casings, and containers for foodstuff and for drinks. Nazi persecution and emigration Starting in about 1933, the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany intensified. This reached a climax on 9November 1938, when Jews were attacked in their homes and businesses during the night of Kristallnacht. Otto Metzger was returning from Britain, where he had just concluded a licensing agreement with a British company, Enfield Rolling Mills Ltd, to use his patented impact- extrusion technology. He was arrested by the Gestapo at the German border, on his way home to Nuremberg, and imprisoned in the Dachau concentration camp. Meanwhile his wife, having had their home and belongings invaded and smashed by Nazi stormtroopers and having spent the night wandering the streets of Nuremberg, waited in vain for Otto‚Äôs return. Otto Metzger was released from Dachau on 15December 1938, and returned home to Nuremberg. By late-February 1939, he had managed to obtain the necessary travel documents to leave Germany, and he and his wife left for Britain. Otto had been unable to obtain documents for his mother Gretchen (who by that time was aged 74); she remained in Nuremberg, and was transported by the Nazis to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where she died in 1943. Later life in Britain On arrival in Britain in early 1939, Otto Metzger was immediately employed by Enfield Rolling Mills Ltd. He stayed with the company until his retirement in 1958, rising to the position of Managing Director. During the Second World War, Otto Metzger was not interned as an enemy alien, as were most German immigrants; the British Government valued his expertise for the war effort. Otto Metzger died of a heart attack in 1961. He and his wife Sophie are commemorated by adjacent rose bushes, planted in the Liberal Jewish Cemetery in London.

The game features vehicles by Volkswagen as part of a licensing deal between Infogrames and the automotive company.  Gameplay  The player begins the game with a standard 1960s Volkswagen Beetle; additional vehicles become available after the player wins races and earns points. The game features 20 race tracks that include environmental elements such as rain and bright sunshine, and includes 17 vehicles that come in more than 50 different styles. In addition to original and New Beetles, the game also features the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, the Volkswagen Thing and Volkswagen buses as playable vehicles. The game includes three gameplay modes: Quick Race, Championship, and Beetle Challenge. Each mode is further divided into five racing modes, known as events, that vary the gameplay: * Buggy: a beach race in which the player must avoid wet sand. * Cross: a stadium with a dirt track consisting of dunes and slopes. * Jump: a track in which the player uses \\"nitro boosters\\" to achieve a large jump. * Monster: a track filled with obstacles in which the player's vehicle is transformed into a monster vehicle with four large tires. The player must smash other vehicles and cause destruction within a time limit, while avoiding traffic cones. * Speed: a street race on a two-lane highway with no nitrous boosters or large obstacles. Specific types of vehicles are used for each event. The game includes a multiplayer mode for two to six players, using a local area network.  Development and release  Beetle Crazy Cup was developed by Xpiral and published by Infogrames. Miguel Tartaj, an executive producer at Xpiral, explained that the idea for the game's concept \\"came from doing all sorts of driving trials. VW had just announced the launch of the New Beetle and we are all 'classic' Beetle enthusiasts so we decided to focus on the Beetle and give it what it deserves: a great game dedicated just to it. The Beetle has always been very popular and people have done incredible things with it since it was first designed.\\" Xpiral secured a publishing agreement with Infogrames after a few meetings. Infogrames signed a licensing deal with Volkswagen to feature the automotive company's vehicles in the game. Xpiral worked on the game for two years. The game was developed with Ambush, an original 3D game engine that was created by Xpiral. The game was announced by Infogrames in December 1999. The game was released in the United Kingdom on 29 February 2000, and in the United States on 6 April 2000.  Reception  Beetle Crazy Cup received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Anthony Baize of AllGame called the game \\"a gem for racing fans and Volkswagen aficionados\\". Baize praised the game's graphics and its surf music, and wrote that the \\"best aspect\\" was the event modes. Tom Price of Computer Gaming World wrote that it \\"is a near-perfect replication of the unique sensation of owning and driving an older .\\" Price noted the vehicles' \\"cartoony\\" graphics, \\"tinny and farty\\" sound effects, and wrote that they \\"handle like crap, just like a real VW,\\" but stated that the game \\"has a weird fun factor\\" because of its various gameplay modes and diverse lineup of Volkswagen vehicles aside from Beetles. Amer Ajami of GameSpot wrote that the different game modes keep Beetle Crazy Cup \\"fresh and enjoyable\\", but criticized the Jump and Monster events for difficulty relating to the controls. Ajami wrote that the vehicles \\"are modeled with a fair amount of detail and are skinned using adequate texture sizes. However, the tracks are somewhat lacking by comparison: The textures used along most of the courses are washed out, and sprite-based trees, crowds, and other outlying objects are typical throughout the entire game.\\" However, Ajami noted that the game's graphics were \\"on par with similar racing games.\\" Jeff Nash of The Electric Playground called the game's controls \\"surprisingly solid\\" but criticized the small number of tracks offered in each racing event, and felt that the game did not offer enough vehicles. Because of the \\"sluggish\\" controls, Nash wrote that the Monster event was \\"a bore to play as the slow movement makes it very difficult to stay interested.\\" Nash noted that the Speed mode \\"is by far the most fun\\" because of its \\"nice selection of tracks with just the right amount of twists and turns\\", and stated that the Buggy and Cross events \\"are both respectable, but the unimaginative track design in these modes makes their races wear thin too quickly.\\" Nash wrote that the game's images \\"are very crisp, and the details around the track are well above average. The graphics do suffer where effects are concerned, however. Reflection, lighting, and smoke effects are all very bland, and often seem to have been thrown in just for the sake of having them there.\\" Nash praised the sound effects, but wrote that the music \\"is so abysmal that it could drive almost anyone to the brink of insanity in no time.\\" Jim Preston of Daily Radar gave the game a positive \\"Hit\\" rating, but called the Monster event mode \\"the weakest of the five modes, as we really weren't interested in avoiding cones or mastering precision driving in a monster truck.\\" Preston noted that the graphics \\"are, not surprisingly, ok. The cars are shiny and realistic, but there is no damage modeling, so plowing headfirst into a guard rail won't cause a scratch. And don't look for any icing on the cake; there are no realtime shadows, 32-bit color or colored lighting here. But the weather effects are fairly realistic, and the night drives through the gloom are actually rather pretty. The backgrounds during the Speed and Buggy modes are realistic and colorful, although not widely varied.\\" Preston concluded that Beetle Crazy Cup was an \\"unpretentious little game that doesn't claim to be anything more than a budget title.\\" Rich Rouse of IGN wrote that the game had \\"quite possibly the most entertaining comedic intro in the history of PC racing games,\\" and noted the use of the words \\"Beetle Racin'\\" several times in the introduction sequence, \\"as if to signify that this was the title of the game when it in fact should read 'Beetle Crazy Cup.' This little tidbit lends to the hypothesis that either the title was changed towards the end of production and there wasn't enough time to alter the intro, or that this was simply a glaring error of the quality assurance team.\\" Rouse called the graphics \\"extremely impressive,\\" but criticized the music: \\"Sounding like a cross between old school country and a circus clown melody, the orchestration here is more than disturbing. Conversely, it must be admitted that these tunes seemed oddly consistent with the general feel of the game.\\" Dave Kosak of GameSpy noted the \\"average\\" sound effects and \\"top notch\\" music, and praised the artificial intelligence, but criticized the game for a lack of customizable vehicles and multiplayer options, as well as the absence of a track editor and the inability to configure tracks. Kosak noted the large number of race tracks and game modes, and wrote that \\"the engine is fast and smooth, and the gameplay is a blast. In that respect, the game is a lot like the car it represents. It's not fancy, but it gets the job done, and it's got tons of style and personality.\\" Steve Bauman of Computer Games Strategy Plus wrote, \\"A simple and fun race game like Beetle Buggin' amuses you for a few days, and after seeing everything you can possibly see, you'll put it on the shelf and occasionally dust it off for a bit more fun. It has little long-term value, but delivers plenty of short-term kicks.\\" William Brown of The Daily Telegraph said he was disappointed by Beetle Crazy Cup and its \\"sluggish\\" and difficult controls, writing, \\"Never has steering been so difficult in a game that should be pure driving joy. The flower power nostalgia does not redeem what could have been a minor classic.\\" Jim Preston of Next Generation called it \\"Fun and colorful. It's the kind of game your mom would buy.\\"  See also  * Beetle Adventure Racing  References   External links  * Volkswagen Beetle Racing video games Multiplayer and single-player video games Infogrames games 2000 video games Video games developed in Spain Windows games Windows-only games ","title":"Beetle Crazy Cup"},{"id":"53424140","text":"Metropolitan Dionysius may refer to: * Dionysius, Metropolitan of Kiev in 1384‚Äì1385 * Dionysius, Metropolitan of Moscow in 1581‚Äì1587 ","title":"Metropolitan Dionysius"},{"id":"53424148","text":"Lumla (Vidhan Sabha constituency) is one of the 60 assembly constituencies of Arunachal Pradesh a north east state of India.

She was graduated from Smith College in 1895, earned her Master's degree in 1897, and her Ph.D. in English from Yale University in 1905. She was an associate professor at Elmira College, 1922‚Äì1924. Smyths mother was from old-line Bangor stock, and she spent summers in the insular coastal hamlet of Islesford, Maine. She began collecting folksongs independently, but soon began working with fellow folklorist Fannie Hardy Eckstorm Smyth, with Fannie Eckstorm, created the 1927 book Minstrelsy of Maine: Folk-songs and Ballads of the Woods and the Coast. Smyth gathered folk songs from coastal areas, which constitute about half the book (Eckstorm concentrated on songs of lumberjacks and other inland people). Smyth and Eckstorm's work came to the attention of Phillips Barry, and they invited him to collaborate. Their second book, British Ballads from Maine: The Development of Popular Songs with Texts and Airs (1929), lists Barry as an editor. While the collaboration between Smyth, Eckstorm, and Barry was fruitful and cordial, Smyth felt that Barry, although a valuable contributor, should not have been given editorial credit, and that this was done in deference to his gender and scholarly reputation. Smyth was a successful song collector and an able researcher. She described to the Bangor Daily News the patience, persistence, and luck that she (and Eckstorm and Barry) needed in conducting fieldwork. According to Smyth, many people were surprised that anyone would be interested in their old songs, and relationships and trust had to be built over time before sources would open up. One trick Smyth employed would be to sing a song wrongly on purpose, knowing that few could maintain silence in the face of that, and would jump in with their version.

Vasco do Rego SJ (born 8 January 1925) is a nonagenarian Jesuit priest from the region of Goa, who has played a significant role in the promotion of Konkani language, literature and music, particularly after the end of Portuguese rule in the area, post-1961. He has been editor of the religious monthly Dor Mhoineachi Rotti for a long stint. Role played Rego is credited with playing an important role in translating the Old Testament into Konkani. Konkani sacred music Writing in the Herald newspaper, journalist Melvyn Misquita says it was a \\"humiliating experience\\" that led Rego to compose \\"Goa's first Konkani Carol in 1963 and hundreds of original Konkani hymns, including a lengthy 18-verse hymn on St Francis Xavier\\". Fr. Rego contributed many hymns in the Gaionancho Jhelo. In January 2015, at the time of the canonisation of Joseph Vaz, the first Goan saint, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Rego was credited with writing the lyrics to the hymn Jose Vaza, Amchea Bhava (Jose Vaz, Our Brother), which was put to music by Fr. Joaquim Loiola Pereira. This hymn was sung at the Mass where Pope Francis elevated the Goan missionary who worked in Ceylon to the altar and which can be heard at about 2:30:48 into this recording. The site song-from-goa.at has a number of sheet- music versions of the work of Rego. In March 2016, the nonagenarian Rego was credited with being one of the four - two priests, and as many musicians: Fr Ubald Fernandes, Fr Vasco Rego SJ, Schubert Cotta and Roque Lazarus - responsible for writing the lyrics of the Konkani film Enemy. Recognition In Goa, he is credited with playing a major role in the fields of Bible translations into Konkani and liturgical translation, building a Konkani religious vocabulary, composing hymns both in lyrics and music for Konkani, and developing the world of Konkani preaching and writing in the Roman script of Konkani. Long-time Jesuit He has been a member of the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits since 1945, was ordained priest in Belgium in 1955, and was inspired by his theologian-teacher Fr Pierre Charles, S.J. to use the Konkani language and music in the liturgy of the people in Goa, where Konkani is a widely spoken language. Rego was the Rector of Goa's famed Bom Jesus Basilica, where the remains of saint Francis Xavier reside, during which period many prominent global figures visited this shrine, among them being Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, President Mario Soares of Portugal, Russian and Indian cosmonauts and Pope John Paul II. Rego is the grandson of Roque and Claudina Correia Afonso, a couple who had seven priests among their 52 grandchildren. His brother is Fernando do Rego.

She wrote poems, short stories, and approximately 34 melodramas of which only 11 remain extant. She is mostly known for adapting dramatic versions of Edward Bulwer-Lytton's Last Days of Pompeii (1835) and Ernest Maltravers (1838), and Robert Montgomery Bird's Nick of the Woods (1838), among others. In an era when successful plays typically ran 3-4 nights, Last Days of Pompeii set a record by running for twenty-nine days.Amelia Howe Kritzer, 'Antebellum Plays by Women: Context and Themes' in The Oxford Handbook of American Drama, ed by Jeffrey H. Richards and Heather S. Nathans (116) This was the earliest known example of a \\"long run\\" for a play, a technique which became regularly used by Thomas Hamblin. Medina is also accredited as the first women in American Theatre to earn her living exclusively as a dramatist. Louisa Medina's progressive inclinations concerning her education and self-reliance marks her as an indicator of the rise of First-Wave Feminism in America.\\"NWHM Exhibit: The History of Women and Education.\\" NWHM Exhibit: The History of Women and Education. N.p., n.d. Web. 03 Mar. 2017 Early life and education Few details are known about Medina's early life, but she spent most of her life in Europe. According to an interview she gave to the Spirit of the Times, her father was a Spanish shipping magnate whose business went bankrupt, leaving her in the charge of distant relatives. Although the unknown relatives were indifferent to her education, Medina pursued \\"the bold, masculine studies usually adopted by the male rather than the female gender.\\"The Spirit of the Times, 1 October 1836, page 258. She reportedly learned Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and English by the time she was a teenager.

She became the governess of Bowery Theatre manager Thomas S. Hamblin's children, and, ultimately, the Bowery's chief playwright and Hamblin's partner. It is speculated that Medina and Hamblin entered a relationship prior to Hamblin's divorce with his last wife. Works While Medina's plays were wildly successful, she drew nearly universal admiration from her peers and the press. Theatrical manager and actor Lester Wallack wrote in his memoirs that Medina \\"was one of the most brilliant women I have ever met.\\"Lester Wallack, Memories of Fifty Years (1889), page 119. An article in the New York Mirror praises 'the fertility of her invention‚Äìwhich is one of the highest attributes of true genius.'The New York Mirror' 28 April 1838, page 351. Many of Medina's plays were presumably lost in the numerous fires that destroyed the Bowery. Besides the plays mentioned above, she also write the early horror story 'Burial by Fire' (1838),The Ladies' Companion June 1838, pages 61-65. 'Panorama of Life' (1838),Burton's Gentleman's Magazine November 1838, pages 325-327. and composed the dedicatory address at the re- opening of the Bowery in 1837 after a fire.'Address' The New-Yorker 21 January 1837, page 287. At least one story, 'Chess Play' (1843) seems to have been published posthumously.The Rover 22 May 1843, pages 61-62. Medina's association with Hamblin made her the chief dramatist of the Bowery Theatre in 1833, and one of the most successful dramatists of the day. In his first spell as Bowery manager, Hamblin accrued heavy debt, which threatened to drive the theatre into ruin. Medina's plays, especially Last Days of Pompeii is credited with saving the Bowery.Rosemarie K. Bank, 'Theatre and Narrative Fiction in the Work of Nineteenth-Century American Playwright Louisa Medina\\" Theatre History Studies vol 3 (1983), page 61. Medina's plays, almost always adapted from novels, blended romantic melodrama and spectacle. According to one source, 'she is partial to startling and terrible catastrophe.'The Spirit of the Times, page 258. The Last Days of Pompeii included the spectacle of an erupting volcano on stage and Nick of the Woods had two characters ride a flaming canoe over a waterfall. Controversy and death In 1838, Hamblin took on eighteen-year-old ingenue Louisa Missouri Miller to star in Medina's Ernest Maltravers. Miller was the half-sister of Josephine Clifton, an actress who had previously worked for Hamblin (and probably been his mistress for a short period). After Miller earned a resounding success in her role, her mother, a notorious brothel owner, tried to take Miller from Hamblin's influence, which resulted in Hamblin arranging for Miller to be his ward. Miller went on to live with Hamblin and Medina amidst rumour that she was Hamblin's mistress. Shortly after this affair, Miller suddenly died of \\"brain fever,\\" with many people suspecting Medina of poisoning her rival.For an account of these events, see Miriam Lopez Rodrigues, Women's Contributions to Nineteenth-Century American Theatre (2011), pages 32-33, as well as Patricia Cline Cohen, et al, editors, The Flash Press (2008), pages 33-38. Also, 'Death of Miss Missouri! Great Excitement in New York--A Coroner's Inquest!' The Daily Picayune 26 June 1838, page 2. Medina would die a few months later from mysterious causes in the home that she shared with Hamblin. Although some accused Hamblin of poisoning her, the coroner's inquest found that the case of her death was apoplexy.'Inquest on the Body of Louisa Medina Hamblin' The New York Spectator 15 November 1838, page 3. After her death, Medina's plays were revived almost yearly, with Nick of the Woods appearing as late as 1882.Bank, 60.

She previously served as editor-in-chief of Essence Magazine and Ms. Magazine. She co-authored the authorized biography Maya Angelou: A Glorious Celebration, and is currently working on her own memoir titled When Blacks Became Americans. She teaches media and communications at SUNY Old Westbury College as a visiting professor.  Early life and education  Gillespie was born in 1944 in Rockville Centre, New York to Charles M. Gillespie and Ethel Young Gillespie. She grew up in a working-class family; her father was a church sexton who also ran a floor waxing business, and her mother a domestic worker who operated a catering business. Gillespie and her sister, Charlene Gillespie, grew up in Long Island, New York. She graduated from a mostly white and Jewish high school and then enrolled in Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois near Chicago, where she received a B.A. degree in American studies in 1966.  Career  Upon graduation, Gillespie moved to New York City after being employed by Time-Life Books, Inc. as a researcher. In 1970, she was hired as a managing editor at the newly-founded African American publication Essence Magazine. After being promoted to editor- in-chief a year later, at age 26, she started the process of transforming Essence Magazine into one of the fastest growing women‚Äôs publications in the United States, as well as a trusted source of inspiration, information, and affirmation for millions of African American women readers. In 1980, Gillespie left Essence to join Ms. magazine as a contributing writer. She went on to serve as contributing editor, executive editor, and finally editor-in-chief by 1992, making her the first African American woman editor-in-chief of a mainstream publication in the United States. Under Gillespie's leadership, Ms. magazine reached the most diverse readership in its history. During her tenure at Essence, Gillespie also served as vice-president of Essence Communications, from 1975 to 1980, and as a member of the board of directors. She co-founded Liberty Media for Women, a limited liability corporation composed of women investors, and served as President.

Resisting with the Communists during the Second World War and then excluded from the Party, he narrowly escaped death in the camps. After the war he studied at Babe»ô-Bolyai University. He is a philosopher, mathematician and science historian, who specialized in the philosophy of mathematics. He worked on non-Euclidean geometry, mathematical irrationality, freedom, Plato and Platonism, Aristotle, Spinoza, Kant, and Hegel. He died on May 11, 2010, in Paris Biography T√≥th was the son of an official of the Habsburg army who had fought in Italy during the World War I with the twelfth Imperial-Royal Horse Artillery Regiment. His father's name was Abraham Roth, but Imre falsified his own documents, choosing \\"Toth\\" as a contrivance to escape anti-Jewish persecution, certain as he was that Roth would soon be recognised as a typically Jewish name. He studied at a Roman Catholic high school, where he found no answer to his doubts about mathematical issues, according to him because of teachers either incompetent or hardly inclined to discuss the truly problematic aspects of those issues. This inclination of his towards such problems apparently explains why he became interested in philosophy, an interest which was to be later fostered by his father's decision to send him to the theological rabbinical seminary in Frankfurt, in order that the young scholar could so have access to the Institute's rich philosophical library. Subsequently, Imre enrolled at the King Ferdinand I University in Cluj; the teaching work of some outstanding faculty members seems to have at this stage reawakened his strong interest in mathematics. With the World War II Imre T√≥th's family was displaced, but his father had beforehand grouped together quite a few of his family's philosophical works, including the Critique of Pure Reason of Immanuel Kant, the Ethica of Baruch Spinoza, and some works by Denis Diderot and Friedrich Nietzsche. Finally, he left a letter asking that the books were not captured. In 1940 Imre entered the underground resistance movement to the Nazis, joining a communist group: for these activities (in particular, for writing on a wall Down with fascism, down with the war, death to fascists) he was arrested and, after interrogation and torture, sentenced to death. He managed somehow to serve a mere six years in prison, and was joined there by news of the successful Operation Overlord (the Normandy landings of the Allies) on June 6, 1944, just as his deportation to Auschwitz along with the group of remaining Jewish inmates of that prison was practically underway. During his last period of imprisonment he was injured by a guard, and hospitalized; he was forced for a while to walk with crutches. Soon did he recover, but his gait was to remain hindered for life. As a detainee he worked out numerous reflections on The Quadrature of the Parabola, a treatise by Archimedes, laying the groundwork for future studies. Following the outcome of the war, he was awarded recognition as \\"the youngest working class hero in the Resistance\\". After the end of conflict he took up his studies at the Babe»ô-Bolyai University, attending classes in mathematics and philosophy from 1945 to 1948. Later on he would teach philosophy and history of mathematics at the University of Bucharest. In 1958 he was struck off the Romanian Communist Party, due to his harsh criticism of the government (he was accused of being an \\"idealist enemy\\", and an \\"agent of imperialism\\"), so he expatriated to Federal Republic of Germany and prosecuted his academic career teaching from 1969 to 1971 at the Goethe University Frankfurt and from 1971 to 1972 at the Ruhr University Bochum. Later until 1990 he held the chair of the History of Sciences at the Institute of Philosophy of the University of Regensburg. T√≥th gave lectures in many universities in Europe and overseas, from Frankfurt to Princeton (Institute for Advanced Study), from the Italian Institute for Philosophical Studies to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris, the city where he died.

It was established in its present form in 2012 from the merger of Sir John Cass Faculty of Art, Media and Design and the Faculty of Architecture and Spatial Design at London Metropolitan University, though it has a history stretching back to the 1800s via its various predecessor institutions. The school took its former name from philanthropist Sir John Cass (1661‚Äì1718), who helped establish funding for education in Aldgate and whose statue is displayed in the University: however, his name was removed from the institutional name in June 2020 because of his associations with the slave trade. The school is presently based at the University's refurbished Aldgate Campus which comprises three buildings, Goulston Street, Calcutta House and The Calcutta Small Annexe in Aldgate, London. The school offers courses across a range of subject areas: art (encompassing fine art, photography, English, creative writing, theatre and performance practice), architecture (including spatial planning and urban design) and design, which includes 3D design (fashion, textiles, furniture, product and jewellery), interiors and visual communication. Courses are provided at all levels including short courses, foundation year, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Learning through practice, playing with process and working with clients; students at the School gain real-world experience in both individual and collaborative projects, engaging with professionals, communities and companies. There is a strong emphasis in the teaching studios on socially engaged architecture, art and design applied to both local and global contexts. The many specialist facilities available to students include wood, metal and plastic workshops, darkrooms and digital manufacturing technology. The school's regular exhibitions, including the famous Summer Show, regularly attract large audiences. Studios A studio or unit is a study group with a particular theme or focus taken by year two and three undergraduate art, architecture and design students and by postgraduate architecture students at The Cass as part of their studies. Studios are led by both academic staff and professional practitioners, sometimes linking to external organisations or project briefs. At the start of each academic year, the leaders of each studio present their studio's themes, position and approach to allow students to choose from a wide range of issues, methods of working and types of project. During the year the studios come together for major events such as Celebration Week ‚Äì when students present work in progress to panels of external critics ‚Äì and summer exhibitions. Controversy over sale of Central House Controversy erupted in late 2015 after London Metropolitan University unveiled plans to cut many of the Cass's signature programmes while moving the Cass from its traditional Aldgate location (which would be sold) to its Holloway campus; this plan attracted opposition from many of Britain's most renowned artists and designers. Senior members of the faculty, such as dean Robert Mull, resigned in protest over the decision and other initiatives, amid protests by students and staff. Despite the opposition, the sale went through in February the next year, though the building continued to be leased out to the university. Location in Aldgate In March 2019 London Metropolitan University formally announced that The Cass would remain in Aldgate. The decision, which was made following a series of discussions with students, staff, industry professionals and the local council, was formally ratified by the University's Board of Governors and announced to the School by the University's Vice-Chancellor Professor Lynn Dobbs Name change On 10 June 2020, the University announced that it would be dropping \\"Sir John Cass\\" from the school's institutional name with immediate effect. The school is now known as The School of Art, Architecture and Design, pending a further official name change. The decision was made in the wake of the George Floyd protests, and calls by the Black Lives Matter movement for the removal and revision of monuments and names commemorating historical figures connected with the slave trade.

Born in Deptford, then in Kent, James' parents died when she was young, and she was brought up by a former employee of her father. She found work making confectionery, and in 1889 she joined the Women's Trade Union Association (WTUA). As a result, she was sacked from her job, but the WTUA helped her find work as a typist, while she volunteered as an organiser and assistant secretary of the WTUA. Its activist Amie Hicks provided her with accommodation and legally adopted James as her daughter.\\"James, Clara Grace\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Through the WTUA, James founded the Confectioners' Union, and served as its general secretary. She worked with Clementina Black and John Burns to win a strike among chocolate makers in 1890, but the union faced high levels of opposition from employers and a highly mobile workforce, leading to its decline and dissolution in 1892. Thereafter, James focused her efforts on trying to organise box-makers. Lilian Gilchrist Thompson paid the WTUA ¬£70 a year for two years to employ James as an investigator. James and Hicks were the only two women to give evidence to the 1891 Royal Commission on Labour. James also served as a delegate to the London Trades Council, and for a time was the only woman to do so. The WTUA was refounded in 1894 as the Women's Industrial Council (WIC), and James remained active within it, serving on both its investigation and organisation committees. However, with her sponsorship having concluded, Thompson instead paid for her training as a gymnastics teacher. Once she had completed this, James set up a series of \\"Working Girls' Clubs\\", providing lectures, physical drills, social meetings and citizenship classes. These proved popular, and in 1899 the WIC founded the Clubs Industrial Association to formalise this activity. Among the young women who attended her classes was Margaret Bondfield. James eventually left the Clubs Industrial Association, founding the rival Working Girls at Play organisation, which by 1909 organised 22 regular clubs across London. She began suffering from poor health and had to give up teaching, retiring to Canvey Island. There, she served as a parish councillor, and ran a holiday home for working girls from London.

After being sold cheaply as a foal she was eventually sent into training with Frances Crowley in Ireland. In four races as a two-year-old in 2004 she showed very promising form, winning a maiden race and finishing placed in both the Moyglare Stud Stakes and the C L Weld Park Stakes. In the following spring she finished sixth in the 1000 Guineas before recording her biggest victory in the Irish equivalent three weeks later. Her victory made her the first Irish Classic Race winner to be trained by a woman. She was well beaten in three subsequent races and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Background Saoire (Irish for \\"holiday\\" or \\"freedom\\") is a chestnut mare bred in Wales by Louise Parry of the Pembrokeshire-base Pantycoed Stud. As a foal she was entered in the Tattersalls sale in November 2002 and was bought for 4,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Larry Stratton. In September 2003 she returned to the sales ring at the Tattersalls Ireland sale and was sold to Martin Cullinane for ‚Ç¨65,000. The filly subsequently entered the ownership of Joseph Joyce and was sent into training with Frances Crowley at Edenderry, County Offaly. Crowley, formerly a successful amateur jockey under National Hunt rules is married to the leading Irish jockey Pat Smullen and is the sister-in-law of the trainer Aidan O'Brien. Her sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Farhh, Sariska, Somnus, Kyllachy and Excellent Art. Saoire's dam Polish Descent was an unraced mare who produced several other winners including Awinnersgame who won a valuable sales race at Doncaster Racecourse in 2008. She was a descendant of What Joy, a half-sister to the dam of Mon Fils. Racing career =2004: two-year-old season= Saoire made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Limerick Racecourse on 22 July in which she started at odds of 7/1 and finished second, beaten three quarters of a length by the favourite Showbiz. In a similar event at Leopardstown on 15 August she started the 11/2 second choice behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Mona Lisa in an eighteen-runner field. Ridden by Fran Berry, she raced in mid-division early on, made steady progress in the straight and caught the favourite in the final strides to win by a short head. The filly was then stepped up sharply in class for the Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and finished strongly to take third place behind Chelsea Rose and Pictavia. Saoire ended her season in the C L Weld Park Stakes at the Curragh on 2 October. Starting the 100/30 third favourite she stayed on in the closing stages to finish second to Jazz Princess with Virginia Waters in third. =2005: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Saoire was sent to England for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 May in which she was ridden by Jamie Spencer and started at odds of 16/1. After being restrained by Spencer in the early stages she stayed on in the last quarter mile and finished sixth of the twenty runners behind Virginia Waters, Maids Causeway, Vista Bella, Karen's Caper and Cape Columbine. Crowley subsequently stated that the filly had become upset on the flight from Ireland. Three weeks after her run at Newmarket Saoire was one of eighteen fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh, with Mick Kinane taking the ride. Virginia Waters started favourite ahead of Maids Causeway and the British challenger Damson (Queen Mary Stakes, Phoenix Stakes) with Saoire the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting. The other runners included Jazz Princess, Mona Lisa, Titian Time (runner-up in the Prix Marcel Boussac) and Penkenna Princess (Fred Darling Stakes). The outsider Sanserif set the pace with Saoire settled just behind the leaders before moving into contention in the last quarter mile. Kinane sent Saoire to the front a furlong out an she held on in a \\"blanket finish\\" to win by a short head and half a length from Penkenna Princess and Luas Line with the first ten fillies home finishing within three lengths of the winner. Crowley became the first woman to officially train a winner of an Irish Classic: Toby Wellesley had trained the winner of the Irish 1000 Guineas in 1948 but did not receive credit as women were not allowed to hold training licenses at that time, and the license was instead held by her male assistant. After the race Kinane said \\"We were right up there from the start and she never dropped out of the first three or four. knew the others were coming to me but she picked up really well\\" while Crowley commented \\"I was watching from a little way down the track from the winning post and I thought we were second. It's fantastic to win a Classic. I made history a few years ago when I was the first woman to win the Irish amateur riders' title and it is great to do it again\\". Saoire was moved up in distance and matched against older fillies and mares for the first time in the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 25 June but she made little impact and finished eighth of the ten runners behind the four-year-old Alexander Goldrun. Despite her poor run in the Pretty Polly she was stepped up in distance again for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the same track on 17 July. After reaching fifth place approaching the final turn she could make no progress in the straight and finished sixth behind the French-trained Shawanda. On her final racecourse appearance Saoire contested the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown on 10 September. After racing in second place she appeared to be outpaced in the straight and finished fifth to Attraction.

Military career After a chance encounter with King Frederick William I, whom Stutterheim liked, he was admitted to the Berlin Cadet corps in 1729. From 1732 he entered the \\"Regiment Kr√∂cher zu Fuss\\" as a flag-bearer. In 1735, he was promoted to ensign and in 1739, to second lieutenant. As such, he went to the First Silesian War and at the Battle of Mollwitz, Stutterheim demonstrated his command abilities and a keen sense of the battlefield. Always ready to encourage initiative in his officers, Frederick awarded him the Order of Pour le M√©rite, and gave him a position at the cathedral in Cammin, and a captaincy in a company in the Regiment La Motte zur Fuss. Stutterheim then fought in the battles of Chotusitz, Hohenfriedberg, and Soor, where, he was wounded. In the year 1747, Stutterheim was promoted to the major and, at the Battle of Lobositz, he again demonstrated his leadership; the king gave him an extraordinary pension of 500 thalers a year. In May, 1757, Stutterheim commanded an infantry regiment as a lieutenant colonel. In this year, in which Stutterheim was also promoted to colonel, he fought at Prague, Kol√≠n, and Breslau; he concluded the year at the Battle of Hochkirch. On 1 January 1759 Stutterheim was promoted to major general and received his own infantry regiment. In 1760 he took part in the battles at Liegnitz and Torgau, where, at the latter, he led a battalion of grenadiers in the initial assault. He was severely wounded at Torgau. In 1761 he returned to the army of Prince Henry, who sent him with 1,600 men to protect the Mark against an invasion of the Swedes. He also made the last campaign, in 1762, under Prince Henry; In the Battle of Freiberg, on 29 October 29, he commanded the left wing of the attacking line. In recognition of his share of the victory, he received a canon at St. Nicolas in Magdeburg. When the peace was concluded, King appointed Stutterheim as inspector of the East Prussian infantry and sent him to K√∂nigsberg. In 1768, after becoming lieutenant general on 24 August 1767, he received the Black Eagle Order and another regiment, the former \\"Regiment Kaunitz zu Fuss\\". He was also appointed governor of Konigsberg, Pillau, and Memel. In the War of Bavarian Succession, he was attached to the King's army at the point of a special corps from Upper Silesia. On 16 August 1778, his corps took possession of the city of Troppau. Accolades Shortly before his death, Frederick wrote a short poem, Alt Stutterheim > Ihr k√∂nnt versichert seyn da√ü Euer Schicksal keinen bessern H√§nden als den > meinigen anvertraut sein kann, Eure Dienste bleiben meinem Herzen > unverge√ülich. > You can be assured that your fate can not be entrusted to better hands than > mine, your services will remain unforgettable to my heart.

He led a relatively uneventful career overshadowed by his successful and talented brother until mid-way through the Seven Years' War. At that point, losses in the general staff forced Frederick the Great to dig deeper into the talent pool to replace his general staff, who were dying of old age, in battle, or simply to sick to carry on. At one point tapped to replace the aging and ailing Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt, he alienated the King; in 1778, immediately prior to the outbreak of the War of Bavarian Succession, a chance comment by Stutterheim on the pending hostilities got him into trouble with the King. He was relieved of his dignities and honors and sent to his estate in retirement. Family He was born 2 November 1718 on the paternal estate Sellendorf in the Lower Lusatia. His parents were Joachim Friedrich von Stutterheim (1683‚Äì1745) and Johanne Eleonore von Hacke (1687‚Äì1737). His father was a captain in the Polish-Saxon army, and a landowner.Bernhard von Poten.

M√§rz 2017, 18:54 Uhr UTC) Military career Young Stutterheim entered the Prussian infantry at the age of fourteen. King Frederick took him into his retinue, appointed him as a lieutenant-in-chief in May 1757, and sent him to East Prussia on the 6 September, to support the Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt, who was standing there against the Russians. After the Battle of Gross-J√§gersdorf on 30 August, the aging and ill Lehwaldt had asked that the King send him somebody \\"either to take command of the corps or to assist him.\\" The King sent Stutterheim. At that time (early 1758), the king wrote to Christoph von Dohna, the second in command, who had to replace the old Lehwaldt, to use Stutterheim as a middleman to influence Lehwaldt, but soon Stutterheim managed to irritate the King, Lehwaldt and Dohna. As early as the 4 March, Frederick sent a very unfriendly letter castigating Stutterheim for not sending enough information, and for not acting as he was ordered. The latter accusation was based on the fact that, according to the King's opinion, the Mecklenburg Duchy was not producing enough recruits; this complaint formed the central theme in the King's complaints about Stutterheim's defects for the remainder of the war. Despite this, in 1758 Frederick promoted Stutterheim to colonel and, on 26 February 1759, to major general. On the latter occasion he wrote that he was satisfied with Stutterheim's report on the deliveries of recruits, and hoped that this was the case, and that the Stutterheim should be worthy of advancement. In April 1759 Frederick made Stutterheim Chief of the completed Bornstedt Infantry Regiment Nr. 20. Frederick's pleasure with Stutterheim was short-lived, and revived to be continued throughout the war. Lieutenant Heinrich von Manteuffel, who then commanded against the Swedes in Pomerania, must have had a better opinion of Stutterheim; he asked for him as commander of his infantry, and the King replied that he should have him, but that Manteuffel should not count on him too much. When, on 28 January 1760, Manteuffel fell into Swedish captivity at Anklam, Stutterheim assumed command. The Russians began their movements against Prussia the middle of August; Stutterheim kept retreating further west toward the Prussian border, much to Frederick's annoyance. The more enterprising Wilhelm Sebastian von Belling had greater success against the same adversaries and managed to hold them at bay for a while until strategic necessities of maintaining communication between both forces required him to retreat. Stutterheim kept his command only because Prince Henry, who was instructed to send someone to relieve Stutterheim, declared that he could not dispense with any of his good generals. At the conclusion of the war, Stutterheim managed to stay out of the King's line of sight. On 24 August 1767, Stutterheim was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general, and in January 1773, he received the Order of the Black Eagle. However, immediately before War of Bavarian Succession, he was completely disgraced. On a visit in Potsdam, in 1778, he allowed himself to comment on the imminent war; the King heard about it and, when Stutterheim asked for his retirement, he received it but, at the same time, the King withdrew his dignities and honors. Stutterheim retired to his estate at Kloster Mansfeld and died there on 29 March 1780.

History View of the castle from the south. Baldenstein Castle was the family castle for the Knights of Baldenstein, the first of which was mentioned in 1246. The central tower which now forms part of the castle was built around the same time. Very little is recorded about the Baldenstein family and by 1289 the castle was owned by the Freiherr von L√∂wenstein. Before 1289 he lost the castle in a war with the Freiherr von Rh√§z√ºns, but in the peace treaty of that year received it back after giving Schwarzenstein Castle to Rh√§z√ºns. In 1349 it passed to the √úbercastel family. Wilhelm von √úbercastel planned to expand and strengthen the castle, but was prevented by the Bishop of Chur, until he granted the Bishop certain rights. Originally the castle consisted of a rectangular bergfried. During the Late Middle Ages an administrative and residential wing was added to the west. Around 1400 the castle passed to the Freiherr von Stein. Through marriage it then passed to the von Ringg (later Ringg von Baldenstein) family in 1453. In 1562 Luzius Ringg sold the castle to Jakob Ruinelli. The Ruinelli family lived in the castle for several generations. Jakob's grandson, also named Jakob, accompanied J√ºrg Jenatsch to Rietberg Castle in 1621 to murder Pompeius Planta during the B√ºndner Wirren. He, in turn, was stabbed to death in 1627 in a brawl between drunken officers. After his death the castle was inherited by the Rosenroll family. During the 16th and 17th centuries the castle was further expanded with a new, larger wing replacing the medieval residential wing. During the same time, the medieval ring wall was replaced with a new crenelated wall. In 1738 the castle was acquired by the Salis-Sils family, who owned it for almost half a century. In 1782 it was inherited by Francesco Conrado, from Chiavenna in Italy. Francesco became a member of Senate of the Helvetic Republic after the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798. Eventually his descendants changed their name to Conrad and still own the castle. In 1877 the residential wing was mostly destroyed in a fire. It was rebuilt to its present appearance in the following years.

The residential wing has many Gothic Revival elements from the repairs following the 1877 fire. The tower-like avant-corps was topped with crow-stepped gables after the repairs. On the ground floor of the residence wing is a hall with a painted ceiling from the third quarter of the 17th century and a fireplace with the coat of arms of the Rosenroll and Ruinelli families. On the second floor there is a sideboard from 1677 and a painted oven from 1670.

He became a lieutenant general in 1811 and general of the infantry in 1824. Career Stutterheim was the son of Lieutenant General Joachim Friedrich von Stutterheim and his wife Sophie Therese von Lettow. Born in 1750 in Pomerania, he entered the military service of Prussia on 4 February 1763, in his father's infantry regiment, called Alt-Stutterheim.Bernhard von Poten, Stutterheim, Ludwig von, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Band 37 (1894), S. 75‚Äì76, Digitale Volltext-Ausgabe in Wikisource, (Version vom 8.

Vernon Lyman Kellogg, trans. Oxford: Clarendon Press; London & New York: H. Milford, 1916, p. 37. He was promoted on 6 June to staff captain and on 1 July 1778 to company captain. He was transferred to the Infantry Regiment No. 55 on 2 April 1789, where he was promoted to major on 4 July 1790. He fought in the war against the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising in Poland, especially at the meeting at Rawka on 6 June and the end of August 1794 was at the Siege of Warsaw, where he received the Order Pour le M√©rite for his actions. In November 1795, he was transferred to the East Prussian Fusilier Brigade, and in September 1797 he was appointed brigadier. =Napoleonic wars= In the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7) against France, Stutterheim commanded the 21st Fusiliers, which was garrisoned in Heilsburg, East Prussia, part of modern-day Poland.German Canadian Museum, Schlacht von Jena - Auerstedt 1806, p. 247. At the Battle of Heilsberg, his regiments formed the advanced guard for the Russo Prussian army.Digby Smith. The Napoleonic Wars Data Book. London: Greenhill, 1998. pp247-248. For his insightful and brave conduct in the Battle of Eylau, he was promoted on 8 March 1807, to major general. Subsequently, he participated at the Battle of K√∂nigsberg (1807) on 14 June 1807 in support for the 3rd Outpost Brigade commanded by Prince von Anhalt Schaumburg. There he had his Fusiliers Nr. 21, two infantry battalions, four squadrons of dragoons, and 1 horse artillery battery. Most of the third outpost brigade under the direct command of the Prince had become separated from the main force on the night of 12/13 June and came up behind the French line. They tried to break through to rejoin Stutterheim's support unit, but were overwhelmed and capitulated.Smith, p. 249. After the loss at Eylau and the subsequent Prussian military disintegration, he aligned himself with the army officers supporting a nationalist war.Enno E. Kraehe, Metternich's German Policy, Volume I: The Contest with Napoleon, 1799-1814, Princeton University Press, 2015, p.72. At the Battle of Heilsberg, Stutterheim's garrisoned troops were part of the advanced guard attack on the French army. The King awarded Stutterheim the Order of the Red Eagle. On 11 December 1809, he became governor of K√∂nigsberg. He retired on 26 November 1811 as a lieutenant general with his pension. On 18 July 1813, though, he returned to the military service for War of the Sixth Coalition. During the Sixth Coalition, he served as quartermaster general of the 30,000 man-strong Austrian H√ºlfkorps, commanded by Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg,Ludwig August Friedrich von Liebenstein, Der Krieg Napoleons gegen Russland in den Jahren 1812 und 1813, Hermann, 1819 - Napoleonic Wars, 1800-1815, Volume 1, pp. 305-306. although he does not appear to have moved west with Schwarzenberg's force,Smith, pp. 443-517. remaining behind to defend eastern Prussia to defend the countryside between the Vistula and the Oder. =Administrative work= After the war, Stutterheim belonged to a board of inquiry that examined the conduct of officers imprisoned by, or who collaborated with, the French. He also participated in the examination of Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, who had managed to salvage the Prussian army after the debacle in 1807. On 8 June 1814, he was governor of K√∂nigsberg for the second time, and held this post until his second retirement on 13 June 1825. In March 1824, he was promoted to General of the Infantry.

It is harvested from Streptomyces netropsis that also produces netropsin. Distamycin prefers AT-rich DNA-sequences and tetrades of [TGGGGT]4. Distamycin inhibits the transcription and increases the activity of the topoisomerase II. Derivates from distamycin are used as alkylating antineoplastic agents to combat tumours.

Both architects have written and lectured on a wide range of topics related to architectural design. In 2006 they were awarded the prestigious Heinrich Tessenow Gold Medal and Erich Schelling Medal for their contribution to architecture.  Buildings  Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates met in London in the early 1990s and were part of a group of architects, theorists and artists who met regularly between 1994 and 1995.The group included Tony Fretton, Adam Caruso, Mark Pimlott, David Adjaye, Jonathan Woolf, Brad Lachore, Juan Salgado and Ferruccio Izzo. The group (informally called Papers on architecture) had a common interest in the urban character of London and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson.Peter Allison, Outside In ‚Äì London Architecture, catalogue published by Architekturforum Tirol, Verlag Anton Pustet: Salzburg, 2000 Among the earliest realised projects by Sergison Bates architects are the public house (pub) in Walsall and the semi-detached house in Stevenage, both of which use motifs of informal architecture.Irina Davidovici, Tectonic presence, in Sergison Bates, Buildings, Quart Verlag: Luzern, 2012 A number of other small scale projects, primarily in London, followed, which also displayed an interest in creating a robust architectural expression through the use of lightweight low-tech construction methods (i.e. thin brick-slip fa√ßade panels on the Studio house in Bethnal Green and cement boards as cladding for a timber panel structure in the self-build housing project in Tilbury). This preoccupation with breathing layered wall constructions culminated in the exhibition project and book ‚ÄúBrick-work: thinking and making‚Äù.Sergison Bates architects, Brick-work: thinking and making, gta Verlag: Z√ºrich, 2005 The unrealised competition design for a museum on the Danish island Bornholm (included in ‚ÄúBrick-work‚Äù) indicated a shift towards a more heavy and monolithic construction form and spatial expression. Two examples of this change in direction are the Urban housing project in Finsbury Park built with a loadbearing wall of brickwork and precast concrete, and the Centre for the applied arts in Ruthin that adopted structure and pigmented fa√ßade elements made of concrete cast in situ. From 2010 Sergison Bates architects were awarded commissions through design competitions for projects in Flanders (Belgium), Switzerland and Austria. In 2016 the firm completed their most prestigious building to date, the Welcome centre and offices for the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research in Shanghai (China).  Writing  In addition to their built work Sergison Bates have produced a significant output of texts, either co-written or authored independently. These were developed from lectures notes or articles for architectural magazines. So far Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates have published three collections of essays: Papers (2002), Papers 2 (2007) and Papers 3 (2016) comprising 54 essays in total.Papers (2002): 10; Papers 2 (2007): 20; Papers 3 (2016): 24 The texts can be described as phenomenological observations of the built environment.Essays with titles include ‚ÄúWorking with appearances‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearning from looking at buildings‚Äù (J. Sergison), ‚ÄúFeeling at Home‚Äù and ‚ÄúTen Rooms‚Äù (Stephen Bates) from Papers 2. The architects consider the process of writing an integral part of the reflective work of architectural design.Sergison Bates architects, ‚ÄûPreface‚Äú in Papers 2, GG: Barcelona, 2007 In the introduction to a lecture given at the Harvard School of Design, I√±aki Abalos described Sergison Bates‚Äô work and approach to architecture as follows: \\"In my opinion there is a serious understanding of the meaning of the notion of material cultural in their work, combined with a radical sense of provocation. Radical in the etymological sense, because it goes to the roots, to the radice, the origins and sense of our historical, typological and material patrimonies, understood as the main references an architect has to deal with if he or she pretends to have a sense of time of the city as a collective cultural construction.\\"Harvard GSD. Lecture: Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates, ‚ÄûOn Continuity‚Äú. Accessed 1. February 2017. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgOk0qCbkSc  Approach and influences  In the Essay ‚ÄúTectonic presence‚Äù Irina Davidovici describes the work of Sergison Bates architects as oscillating between the complementary aspects of the ‚Äúformal‚Äù and the ‚Äútectonic‚Äù where ‚Äúthe use of images has always been sustained by constructional research‚Äù. In the preface to the catalogue of selected works published in 2006, the renowned architectural historian √Åkos Mor√°vanszky states that the architecture of Sergison Bates is concerned with ‚Äúprecision‚Äù interpreted as an ‚Äúexpression that unveils the significance of nuance‚Äù.√Åkos Morav√°nszky, in: Sergison Bates architects, Catalogue 1996-2006, London 2006 In addition to their identity-defining interest in the work of the Smithsons (both their buildings and writings)Jonathan Sergison, ‚ÄúLessons learnt from Alison and Peter Smithson‚Äù, in L‚Äôarchitecture d‚Äôaujourd‚Äôhui, (344) 2003 ‚Äì see also Sergison Bates, Papers 2, GG: Barcelona, 2007 ‚Äì as well as ‚Äúimages of ordinary typologies‚Äù, the work of Sergison Bates is inspired by English classicism, as exemplified in their fascination with Hardwick Hall.‚ÄûSergison Bates‚Äô inspiration: Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire‚Äú.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History The arms of its founder (Thomas de Lyons) are on the outside of the tower. The interior has some fine tombs, and some relatives of the poet Robert Southey are buried in the churchyard. The building underwent Victorian restoration between 1871 and 1872 when the chancel, vestry and south chapel were added. In 2011 the heating system in the church failed. Since then solar panels and new radiators have been installed. In 2016 an appeal was launched to replace the flagstones within the church. The parish is part of the benefice of Long Ashton with Barrow Gurney and Flax Bourton within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The church has a nave, north and south aisles, chancel and vestry along with a three-stage west tower. The tower contains a peal of eight bells having been increased from six to eight in 1897 and rehung in 1903. The Tenor of this fine peal weighs in at 30.3.23 CWT or 1573 KG making the bells here the 11th heaviest ring of 8 in the world. After 107 years of continual use, the bells were rehung once again in 2010 By John Taylor & Co of Loughborough, and were hung on self aligning modern ball bearings, making the bells easier to ring. The fine rood screen is from the 15th century. Within the church is a 19th century church organ which was rebuilt by J.G.Haskins & Co. Churchyard Amongst the gravestones and memorials in the churchyard are several which are Grade II* listed buildings. The oldest is for John and Alice Smith who died in 1591. A chest tomb of Elizabeth Phelps from 1698, and one of Anna Whiting from 1700, The memorial to George Whiting was added in 1709, and Robert Whiting in 1662, while another Robert Whiting is from 1679, and another with the same name from 1693. Together the chest tombs, which have renaissance details form an important group. Other monuments are to Philip Bower, the Pomroy family, the Ford family, Elizabeth Hayward, William Cambridge, William Poultney James Miller and John Howard.

Hardison is well known for being one of the first high profile black models after her appearance at the 1973 Battle of Versailles fashion show. She is also known for her activism on diversity in the fashion industry. Hardison has received several accolades for her work, including the 2014 CFDA Founders Award. Hardison is the mother of actor Kadeem Hardison.  Life and career  Hardison was born in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from George W. Wingate High School, Hardison attended the New York University Art School and the Fashion Institute of Technology but did not graduate from either. For a brief period Hardison worked as a corrections officer at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility. During the 1960s, Hardison worked in the garment district of New York City as saleswoman. In 1967, she was discovered by African American designer Willi Smith and began working for Smith as a fitting model, soon crossing over to the runway and print industries. Along with Beverly Johnson, Iman, and Pat Cleveland, Hardison broke barriers in the 1970s appearing in Allure, Harper's Bazaar, and Vogue. In 1973, she was featured in the Battle of Versailles fashion face off, a historical moment in which France's best designers competed against the top American designers of the time. Hardison then joined Click, a startup modeling agency, in 1980, as a booking agent where she produced fashion shows, handled public relations for design houses, and became a contributing editor at several magazines. Concerned with the politics of the fashion industry, Hardison changed her focus from modeling to activism in 1981.

The formation can be traced from Hertfordshire to Dorset, but the chalk of Berkshire is only about half the thickness seen in other locations as it is thought that it was deposited over an area of relatively higher ground (the Berkshire-Chiltern Shelf, part of the London Platform) and therefore in shallower seas.

The movie is the latest feature film directed by the Brazilian filmmaker Aluizio Abranches who also produced the movie with Ilda Santiago. The screenplay was written by Fernando S√£o Thiago and the two great actors Alexandre Borges and Camila Morgado star in the movie. The film is a production of Hare Filmes, founded as Lama Filmes in 2001, that produced The Three Marias (2001) and From Beginning to End (2009). Distributed by Imagem Filmes, the film debuted in Brazilian cinemas at the end of 2015 with great reception from the public and critics. Plot Heitor and Alice land a job shooting the wedding of a woman (Bruninha, played by Lu√≠za Mariani) who is marrying the rich son of a Senator and a socialite. It's shown that Heitor has a problem taking too many antidepressants. While shooting the bachelorette party, Heitor meets Pen√©lope, who spots him about to eat an antidepressant that he'd dropped. She steps on it, crushing it to powder, and walks into the party. Heitor accidentally eavesdrops and learns that Pen√©lope is the groom's former lover and that, spurned by the groom's mother, Pen√©lope plans to befriend Bruninha and break up the wedding. Distracted by Pen√©lope, Heitor hands his camera to a waiter (Fernando, played by Fernando S√£o Thiago) and asks him to hold it for him. Fernando takes the camera and starts shooting photos of the bachelorette party. Pen√©lope convinces Heitor to help her get into the wedding when she reveals that she's pregnant. Meanwhile, desperate for more help after an employee leaves, Heitor hires Fernando and instructs Alice to teach him. Pen√©lope and Heitor meet a former lover of Heitor, Laura, who is stunningly beautiful and financially successful. Pen√©lope learns that Bruninha is actually pregnant and decides to not crash the wedding. Meanwhile, Alice stirs up some young protesters to loudly protest the outdoor wedding in the middle of the wedding ceremony, which is swiftly finished. While hiding, Pen√©lope reveals to Heitor that she isn't pregnant and he storms away. That evening Pen√©lope goes to Heitor's house and falls asleep on his couch after apologizing. She wakes to find that he moved her to his bed and slept on the couch himself. Heitor mentions that he doesn't really know what to do with the video because of the protesters who ruined the main portion of the wedding. Pen√©lope buys some presents for Heitor, Alice, and Fernando to apologize and talks them into letting her help edit the wedding video. She says that they aren't making the video for the bride and groom but rather for the parents, and that since the Senator is more important than his wife, they should focus on him. Also, they should lie a little in the video. After finishing, Heitor and Alice deliver the video where Bruninha's mothers is astonished to see a cut of Pen√©lope in the video. It's revealed that they managed to tweak the sounds of the protesters to chant, \\"The Senator is King...\\" etc. The Senator loves it, and when Bruninha's mother tries to pay Heitor 1/10 of the promised price, the Senator instead gives Heitor an even larger check, which he shares with Alice, Fernando, and Pen√©lope. Pen√©lope continues working with them and sets up a social media account for Heitor to meet up with Laura. Pen√©lope then secretly messages Laura as Heitor, even going so far as to engage in cyber sex, then invites Laura to meet at a wedding. Laura arrives drunk and tries to have sex with Heitor then rushes off. Heitor follows at a distance and spots her drunkenly punching holes in a condom with a needle. He convinces Pen√©lope to make a scene, then says that she mixed antidepressants with alcohol and that he has to take her home. Alice gets drunk and kisses Fernando then runs off. That evening, Heitor finds that Pen√©lope has stolen a small memento of every wedding she's been to, including the wedding photograph of his own mother. Heitor is shocked, but says that his love for Pen√©lope is strong enough that he can live with his foible of hers, and that he hasn't taken an antidepressant since he met her. The next morning, Alice wakes up to find that Fernando put her in his bed to sleep it off while he slept on the couch. Alice presents Fernando with a business card with his name on it, welcoming him into the wedding-shooting business, calling it a family, and Heitor gives Pen√©lope a business card with her name on it. They are all shown to be friends with each other as they continue to shoot weddings.

Josselyn (January 14, 1842 - April 4, 1905) was a first lieutenant in the Union Army who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the American Civil War at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. Biography Simeon Truman Josselyn was born in Buffalo, New York on January 14, 1842, the son of Samuel J. Josselyn and Rebecca (Teachout) Josselyn. He enlisted in the Union Army on April 21, 1861 in Amboy, Illinois. He rose to the rank of sergeant before receiving his second lieutenant's commission in November 1862. He was promoted to first lieutenant in November 1863 and discharged in June 1864. He was awarded the medal \\"for extraordinary heroism on 25 November 1863, while serving with Company C, 13th Illinois Infantry, in action at Missionary Ridge, Tennessee. While commanding his company, deployed as skirmishers, First Lieutenant Josselyn came upon a large body of the enemy, taking a number of them prisoner. Lieutenant Josselyn himself shot their Color Bearer, seized the colors and brought them back to his regiment.\\" The flag that Josselyn took was from the 18th Alabama infantry, and eventually was forwarded to Daniel Butterfield, then to the War Department, and finally to the State of Alabama. In this action against the 18th Alabama Infantry, Josselyn single-handedly captured the nine men of the regimental color guard, who were returned to the Union lines as prisoners. After the war, Josselyn worked for the Illinois Central Railroad. He later moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he worked as an accountant and paymaster for the Union Pacific Railroad and was the corporate secretary for the Omaha Fire Insurance Company. He subsequently started his own insurance brokerage, S. T. Josselyn & Company. Josselyn was a Mason and a member of the Grand Army of the Republic and Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Her work focuses on personal experiences as a Latina and self-proclaimed Nuyorican growing up and living within New York City.  Biography  = Early life = The daughter of two Puerto Rican parents from Spanish Harlem, Michele Carlo grew up with her family in a primarily Italian and Irish neighborhood in the East Bronx. Much of her later artistic work focuses on issues of identity stemming from childhood experiences in the Bronx. = Career = Carlo attended New York City Community College for a year before being accepted into the School of Visual Arts. She obtained the position of assistant art director at an advertising agency, however after participating in a production of Guys & Dolls Carlo decided to suspend her pursuit of a career in visual arts in favor of one in acting and performance. In 1995 she appeared in the independent film Living in Oblivion. From 1995 to roughly 2004, Carlo was a regular participant in productions at Surf Reality, an underground venue on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Beginning in the mid-2000s she began appearing at performance storytelling events hosted by The Moth, The Liar Show, and Literary Deathmatch. Carlo published her memoir, Fish Out of Agua: My Life on Neither Side of the (Subway) Tracks, in 2010. Her essays and stories have also been published in Huffington Post and SMITH magazines, Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul, and Lost & Found: Stories from New York.

In Carlo's 2010 memoir, Fish Out of Agua, she calls herself a \\"double outsider:\\" Her freckles and curly red hair caused people to often mistake her as white, much to the dismay of her proudly Spanish-speaking relatives, yet she finds that she is not white enough for her friends and schoolmates. At one point she recalls her father telling other residents of their neighborhood that although they may be Puerto Rican, their family was from the \\"Italian part\\" of Puerto Rico, in an attempt to avoid ostracism and prejudice. Later, she recalls getting lost at a Puerto Rican Day parade and a voice on the loudspeaker announcing, \\"'Will the family who brought the little redheaded white girl please come pick her up?' I looked around. I am at the bandstand! I am that lost girl!\\" In her memoir, Carlo's descriptions of such memories use both intimately personal memories as well as humor in order to chronicle a childhood of trying to find some sort of balance in her identity. \\"New York is like a shark,\\" she says in an article by Curbed New York. \\"If it stops moving, it dies.\\" In her latest project, There Goes the Neighborhood, Carlo continues to use her own experiences to reflect New York City's ever-evolving nature. The 55-minute solo performance revolves around her struggle to find a new apartment after being forced out of the one she had lived in for twenty years, and in doing so touches on issues of gentrification in Brooklyn. At one point in the show, she describes riding in a car with a realtor who, not realizing that Carlo herself is Puerto Rican, tells her, \\"I don't recommend that you take an apartment above 10th street, dear...That's where all the Puerto Ricans live.\\" This personal account provides evidence of the physical and social boundaries that obviously still exist within many New York neighborhoods, and in doing so speaks directly to Carlo's Latinx audience (especially those who may be white-passing). In the article by Curbed New York, she also cites the formation of the Prospect Park Alliance and its successful efforts at cleaning up the park and the surrounding area as a tipping point for Brooklyn's gentrification. \\"Nobody wants to be chased up five flights of stairs screaming, 'Open the door' because you're about to be jumped. but why can't there be some kind of common ground that respects the elderly and longtime residents that do not have the wherewithal or desire to relocate? How is it right to tell a family, 'Well now that the neighborhood's safer, and the park is clean and the schools are better, you don't get to live here anymore.'\\" In her observations of this transformation, Carlo questions the motives of those who led the effort to make this area \\"the beautiful oasis it is today.\\" In cleaning up the area surrounding Prospect Park, did such groups also hope to scrub out long-time residents and racial minorities, as well as the unique culture they had created? Overall, reflections on the past in There Goes the Neighborhood and Carlo's other works provide more than just moments of nostalgia for New York natives. They chronicle the evolution of an entire city, and how these changes affect entire groups of people and the Latinx community as a whole.

The SCGC has certification under the Federal Status of the Artist Act to represent the interests of all composers in Canada working on English-language productions. The SCGC is a member of the Coalition for the Diversity of Cultural Expressions.  Background  The SCGC was first founded in 1980 as the Guild of Canadian Film Composers (GCFC)The Toronto Film Scene, Spotlight On: The Screen Composers Guild of Canada, June 5, 2013 by composer and jingle producer Ben McPeek. He wanted to form an association that could demonstrate to the film and television industries that first class scores could be composed and recorded in Canada. By organizing people who had a stake in the business of composing for film and television the GCFC would raise awareness with regard to the talent available in our country. If the work was being done locally there would be considerably savings both in time and money, which was an advantage for the producers/directors. Members also knew that if they couldn‚Äôt do the job the work would go to someone locally and therefore keep the work in Canada. By keeping the work in Canada members would then have a better shot at the next job as a result of the growth of the local industry has been ingrained in our organization ever since. This idea of thinking collectively to help the community and in the long run help the individual. Subsequently, more people were hired locally the industry began to take root and less work was being sent to other countries. Ultimately when the industry flourished each of the individuals would benefit. The original members include composers such as Glenn Morley, Harry Freedman, and Bill McCauley. The membership of the Guild was made up not only of composers but lawyers, agents, publishers such as Bob Hahn and Tony Tobias, and others who had an interest in the making of film and television music.  Organization and Growth  In the early 1980s the Guild met at the Canadian Music Centre and had approximately 15 members. The original mandate was \\"The Guild of Canadian Film Composers is a national association of professional composers and music producers for film, television, and new media. The Guild's purpose is to further the interests of its members with respect to Canada's cultural industries and agencies, film producers and music publishers.\\" In the mid 1990s, the Guild created a new mandate \\"To improve the quality and status of music as it applies to film and television, through education and the professional development of its members and the producing community.\\" During this period professional development took on an informal structure with members exchanging information, providing knowledge of contracts, potential jobs and negotiation tactics. The Guild also created a Composer (As Contractor)/Producer Model Agreement which has become a standard in the industry., SCGC Model Contract. The GCFC received certification May 23, 2003 under the Federal Status of the Artist Act. Government of Canada Canada Industrial Relations Board, Status of the Artists Act, Certification, 2013-04-29 The Guild of Canadian Film Composers changed its name to the Screen Composers Guild of Canada in 2010 to reflect the change in the film and television industries to include media for both large and small screens, and the changes in its members' working environments and skills.SaskMusic Directory, Associations In 2014 the Ontario Media Development Corporation funded a research study entitled \\"Baseline Study on the Membership and Industry of the Screen Composers Guild of Canada\\" which documented the professional environment of screen composers in Canada and serves as a baseline for subsequent studies to be measured against.OMDC Research, Screen Composers Guild of Canada Baseline Study  Rights and Representation  The SCGC is a member of Music Creators North America (MCNA), a joint lobbying group made up of the SCGC, the Songwriters Association of Canada, the Society of Composers & Lyricists, The Council of Music Creators, The Songwriters Guild of America, Songwriters of North America, LA Branch, and La Soci√©t√© professionnelle des auteurs et des compositeurs du Qu√©bec.Music Creators North America, official website Through the MCNA, the SCGC represents music creators at CIAM, the International Music Creator advisory body for International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC).CIAM Partner Organizations, Music Creators North America, retrieved 03-17-2017.

Nowlin. The film is also produced by Nowlin, alongside Ridley Scott, Wes Ball, Courtney Solomon and Mark Canton. Originally advertised as Phoenix, the film tells the story of the disappearance of three teenagers who set out to find the source of the widely reported 1997 UFO phenomenon known as the \\"Phoenix Lights\\". It was released on April 21, 2017 to mixed reviews, with many critics unfavorably comparing it to The Blair Witch Project. Plot Sophie Bishop and her boyfriend Dan visit Sophie's parents in Phoenix, Arizona on the 20th anniversary of her older brother Josh's disappearance. On March 13, 1997, the family witnesses the Phoenix Lights during Sophie's 6th birthday party, with Josh recording the incident. Several strange lights appear in a \\"V\\" formation over the city before disappearing, followed closely by fighter jets. Josh becomes convinced they have witnessed UFOs, though others remain skeptical. Hoping to find answers to her brother's fate, Sophie begins reviewing all of Josh's saved videotapes. In the tapes, Josh begins investigating the Phoenix Lights with the help of his friends Ashley and Mark. Ashley and Josh interview two astronomers, who theorize that the lights were flares dropped by jets from the nearby Luke Air Force Base. However, Ashley and Josh remain unconvinced. Several days later, more mysterious lights appear over Mesa. Hoping to capture the lights on film and in better quality, Josh, Ashley, and Mark drive to Mesa. Upon arrival, the trio climb a hill on the outskirts of the town before noticing a spotlight in the distance facing sky- ward. Curious, the trio hike toward the spotlight where they find a gathering of Sheriff's Deputies and mysterious men. Josh notices the cars belonging to the men have no license plates. The group is then spotted by the men, forcing them to flee. The next day, Josh plots the apparent course of the lights, determining they will soon appear over an isolated area of the desert. In the present day, Sophie continues to interview multiple parties regarding the trio's disappearance. Only the group's abandoned car and a camera with single tape was discovered. Sophie views the recovered tape, showing the beginning of the group's journey to find the lights and discovering a charred animal corpse. As the tape ends, Sophie refuses to believe Josh did not record the remainder of the trip. She concludes that Josh must have had a second camera. Sophie and Dan visit the local high school, where Ashley was a film editor and would have had access to such equipment. However the film teacher does not have any logs that may have been filled out, leaving Sophie at a dead end. Before departing Phoenix, she interviews her parents who reveal that the strain of Josh's disappearance caused them to divorce. The next night, Sophie receives a call from the teacher, who claims to have found something. She returns to Phoenix and receives a box that had been mailed to the school several years prior before being placed in storage. Sophie and Dan open the box and discover a heavily damaged camera. Dan manages to retrieve the tape from within the camera before watching it with Sophie. The film then cuts to Sophie after having watched the tape, clearly distraught by its contents. She then contacts a Captain at Luke Air Force Base for an interview. Upon arrival however, the Captain appears confrontational with Sophie while Dan waits with the camera in the car. Sophie then returns and claims the Captain ordered her to \\"not let the footage get out\\". Dan asks Sophie what to do next, with Sophie giving him a look of determination. The film then cuts to the contents of the recovered tape, comprising the remainder of the film. The last film begins moments after Josh, Ashley, and Mark find the charred corpse. The trio continues to hike through the desert and up a hill. Meanwhile, Ashley and Mark appear to grow closer, much to the disdain of Josh. After waiting at the top of a hill for several hours, the trio witness a single light in the distance. The light hovers for several minutes before accelerating along the horizon. The light grows progressively brighter and faster before discharging several, smaller lights. All the lights subsequently vanish. The trio celebrate their recording before hiking back to the vehicle. As night falls, the teens become lost and disoriented. Mark ventures up a hill alone to try and spot the car. After he leaves, Ashley and Josh hear loud sound in the distance that appears to be getting closer. A bright light then appears behind the hill before passing over them. Mark returns, visibly distressed but apparently unharmed, claiming to have found the car. As they walk back, Mark refuses to disclose what he saw at the top of the hill. The trio then find the car and attempt to return home. As they drive, the light appears behind the car and pursues them. They attempt to flee before the light disables the car and vanishes. Unable to fix the vehicle, the trio hike along the road attempting to get back to town. As they walk, Mark begins showing severe symptoms of an unknown illness, including a nosebleed, fever, and disorientation. Mark then claims to hear voices, before running out into the desert while claiming to see his brother. As Ashley and Josh run after him, the light returns and Mark vanishes without a trace. Ashley begins to panic, while Josh comforts her. The two then notice a house light in the distance and resolve to follow it. Along the way, the two discover more charred animal corpses. In addition, Ashley also begins to show similar symptoms as Mark, including her hair falling out. Continuing on, Ashley begins to hear an unknown sound. She then claims to see her father in the distance before running off with Josh following her. As they run, the light returns, causing lightning and high winds around them. Josh then captures the source of the light, revealed to be an alien craft appearing as several concentric, rotating rings. Josh then witnesses Ashley being lifted off the ground before being abducted in a flash of light. The tape then cuts to Josh arriving at the deserted home, still pursued by the alien craft. He attempts to hide inside the house. Meanwhile, the craft causes various appliances to explode and gravitational distortion. Josh begins to scream as the craft removes the roof of the house, then also quickly lifts him off the ground in a flash before the camera cuts out. The tape resumes as the camera catches a brief glimpse of space, before falling back down to Earth. The camera lands, recording the sunset for several minutes before dying as the credits roll.

Description and history The caverns comprise an irregular series of neo- Romanesque ambulatories and chambers hollowed out of sandstone, with carved archways, pillars, symbols and niches, apparently for candles. They are located about west of Caynton Hall, beneath privately-owned woodland, within a disused stone quarry.

It was first described by Hjalmar Th√©el, a Swedish scientist. Scotoplanes globosa, along with numerous other sea cucumbers were discovered by Th√©el during an expedition on the between the years of 1873-1876. Scotoplanes globosa was officially described in 1882, 6 to 9 years after its first sighting. Scotoplanes globosa is most closely related to the genus Peniagone.  Ecology  Congregations of smaller Scotoplanes globosa are often observed on the ocean floor in groups of 10 to 30. However, groups of Scotoplanes globosa have been observed to be as many as 600 individuals in one congregation. A congregation of Scotoplanes globosa is called a ‚Äútrawl‚Äù. These groups of Scotoplanes globosa often appear to all be facing in one direction, into the ocean current. It is believed that this behavior aids S. globosa in the detection of the richest feeding sites. Scotoplanes globosa has also been observed to be the host of multiple deep-sea parasites, such as the small gastropods Stilapex and Crinolamia, and various parasitic crustaceans. These parasites typically bore small holes into the body wall of S. globosa. Scotoplanes globosa are also often accompanied by a symbiotic lithodid crab, the Neolithodes diomedea. It is believed that approximately 22% of Scotoplanes globosa are attended by at least one of these crabs. At this time, scientists are unsure whether the relationship between S. globosa and N. diomedea is mutualistic or commensal.  Anatomy  Scotoplanes globosa is typically 2 to 15 cm in length and appear to be a translucent white color. S. globosa is covered in tube-like feet which are used in locomotion. The tube-like structures found on top of the Scotoplanes globosa are also feet, as opposed to antennae. Scientists are still unsure whether these upper- tube-feet are used in locomotion or used as sensory accessories. They are quite buoyant and are easily displaced by strong currents. = Locomotion = Scotoplanes globosa has a soft, round body with five-to-seven pairs of long, tube-like limbs extending from its body. S. globosa uses these limbs for locomotion. They ‚Äúwalk‚Äù along the ocean floor using muscle constrictions to push fluid in and out the tube feet cavities. Scotoplanes is the only genus of holothurians that have been observed to \\"walk\\" in this manner.  Distribution and habitat  Scotoplanes globosa are found in almost all deep-sea regions in the world. Specifically, S. globosa live on the abyssal plain. They are commonly found off the coast of San Diego, as well as in the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Scotoplanes globosa typically live at depths of over 1000 meters, and have been found in the deepest locations in the ocean.  Diet  Scotoplanes globosa is a deposit feeder, eating detritus which has sunk to the ocean floor. S. globosa has been observed to strongly prefer consuming fresh, recently fallen (approximately within the last 100 days) sediments on the surface of the ocean floor as opposed to older sediments. These freshly-fallen sediments are more nutrient-rich. Scotoplanes globosa captures food through its mucous-covered tentacles which surround their mouth. S. globosa is also known to congregate around the carcasses of whales which have fallen to the seafloor. Lundsten et al. (2010) determined that S. globosa find deep-sea whale carcasses by smell, as well as other nutrient-rich food sources; the extremely nutrient-rich whale carcasses also attract other deep- sea creatures in large numbers.''

This was an orchestra which played music during silent films shown in the famous Tuschinski movie theater in Amsterdam until the Nazi occupation 1940-1945. Owner and managing director was Abraham Tuschinksi. In the second half of the 1920s Louis de Vries worked with the Excellos Five, Marek Weber and The Ramblers together with his brother Jacob. In 1930 he played with Ben Berlin and in 1931-1932 with Juan Llossas. From 1933 onwards he worked with his brother once more, almost up until his death.

Controversies In 2016, Jane published an open letter to Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive officer of Yelp, where she worked as a customer service representative for Yelp's Eat24 food delivery service. Her letter focused on Yelp's low wages and the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was fired shortly after publishing the letter, the news of which garnered significant media attention. She received severance pay of $1,000 and wasn't allowed back at Yelp. The letter detailed struggles of living on an after-tax wage of a little more than $8 an hour, living 30 miles from the workplace in an apartment costing $1,245 a month, with commuting costs of more than $11 per day. Several outlets published critiques of Jane's life choices that argued ways to alleviate her economic struggles, such as having a roommate. These pieces painted Jane as an entitled millennial, earning her nicknames such as \\"Narcissa by the Bay\\" from the conservative National Review. In an interview with VICE, Jane shot back against critics, asking \\"Who is the right messenger? Up until now, how many of the people accusing me of being entitled were actually discussing the living wage issue? If they don't think I'm the right voice to say this stuff, why don't they find the person who is and uplift their voice rather than bringing down mine? Any voice is still better than silence.\\" The media storm generated criticism directed at Yelp. Prank orders increased and many customers said they would stop using the service. Yelp responded that the high cost of living was to blame and announced additional customer support jobs in Arizona. Yelp instructed customer service representatives not to talk about their wages to customers. Other outlets used the open letter to promote moving to lower cost areas and to highlight weakened economic conditions for Americans in their 20s and 30s. Two months later, Yelp raised the pay of Eat24 customer service representatives from $12.25 to $14 an hour, added 11 paid holidays (from zero), and increased the number of days of paid time off from 5 to 15. Yelp did not reference Jane in its announcement and said that changes had been in the works since quarter 4 2015 ‚Äì three months before Jane published her letter. Employees at Yelp reportedly dispute this claim and believe Jane was the \\"whistleblower\\" who prompted the changes. The controversy was highlighted in Nebraskan Junior Senator Ben Sasse's 2017 book The Vanishing American Adult, where he wrote that \\"Some parents may quickly nod their heads in hearing that Talia Jane was fired from her job\\" and claimed \\"Our Founders...would panic at the survivability of a nation if we have too many Ms. Janes\\". In an analysis for the Washington Post, writer Malcolm Harris noted that Jane was \\"pilloried in the media as just another entitled millennial who wanted things handed to her\\" but noted of the resulting wage increase: \\"Many large labor actions have achieved less\\". Jane was named one of Business Insider's 100 \\"most amazing and inspiring people in tech right now\\" as well as one of Inc.com's \\"25 Coolest Women in Silicon Valley,\\" both of which credited her open letter for sparking conversation about living wage in Silicon Valley. She spoke about this experience at XOXO Festival. Her talk focused on the impact of online harassment. In May 2019, she was the recipient of a sexually explicit message via Twitter that was sent to her by a Seattle Times reporter.https://www.seattlepi.com/seattlenews/article/Seattle-Times- reporter-Mike-Rosenberg-DM-sexual-13820880.php The reporter was suspended by the Times and resigned from the paper on June 7, 2019.

In good seasons it forms clumps of up to ten plants.Caladenia radialis habit Caladenia radialis labellum detail  Description  Caladenia radialis is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which often forms clumps of up to ten plants after good rainfall. It has a single erect, hairy leaf, long and about wide. One or two red and cream-coloured flowers long and wide are borne on a stalk tall. The sepals and petals have long, brown, drooping thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal curves forward and is long and about wide. The lateral sepals and petals have about the same dimensions as the dorsal sepal although the lateral sepals are slightly wider. The labellum is long, wide and cream-coloured with red lines. The sides of the labellum sometimes have a few short teeth, the tip is curled under and there is a dense band of red or cream-coloured calli along the mid-line. Flowering occurs from August to early October.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia radialis was first described in 1927 by Richard Rogers from a specimen collected near Dowerin and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (radialis) is derived from the Latin word radius meaning \\"ray\\", \\"rod\\" or \\"spoke\\", referring to the radiating red lines on the labellum.  Distribution and habitat  The drooping spider orchid is found between the Fitzgerald River National Park and Northampton in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in a range of habitats including on granite outcrops and near the edges of salt lakes.

S. Jayaraman was one of fifty prominent writers featured in the SG50 publication on Tamil writers. His contributions are considered as part of Singapore literature, a collection of literary works by Singaporeans in any of the country's four main languages: English, Malay, Standard Mandarin, and Tamil. The author was also a practitioner of kundalini yoga with the Simplified Kundalini Yoga Society in Singapore.  Early life  S. Jayaraman arrived in Singapore in 1949 without an ability to neither read nor write. He attended night classes to study English, Tamil and Tamil literature in the 1950s. His Tamil tutor was Murugu Seenivaasan from whom he studied Tamil literature and prose writing. He also took part-time courses at the Singapore Electronics Institute in the 1960s and build a radio as part of his practical assignments. He received a Diploma in Electronics from the then Member of Parliament for Anson Govindasamy. He married J. Rajamani in 1954 in India. S.

Simple tunes and simple verses make the story to be followed easily. The villu, a bow, the age-old weapon of warriors - paradoxically lends itself to be used as a primary musical instrument for the Villu Pattu artists. He also participated in an essay writing competition organised by the Kilang Thirukkural Association and won the first prize for an essay entitled \\"Thirukuralum Ghandhiyadigalum\\". In his free time, S.

Three IRA members killed six civilians and themselves in the explosion. The event was one of the bloodiest of 1972, the deadliest year of The Troubles.  Background  Since 1971, the Provisional IRA had been waging a campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland. Gun and bomb attacks became daily occurrences in the province as the campaign continued. In January 1972, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment shot dead 14 civil rights protesters in Derry, in an event later known as Bloody Sunday. The attack enraged the nationalist community and as a result support for the IRA surged. In the following months the ferocity of the conflict, and as a result number of casualties, rose dramatically. Military installations and civilian businesses were targeted frequently. Civilians often fell victim to the IRA's attacks. This most prominently occurred on Bloody Friday, when at least 20 bombs planted by the IRA exploded in quick succession in Belfast. As a result of the bombs, 9 people were killed and another 130 injured. Newry, a mainly nationalist town near the Irish border, had a lot of IRA supporters.

It was developed by Mattis \\"machineboy\\" Folkestad and released on January 5, 2017. The game's plot features a Scandinavian milkmaid, Ruth, who loses her cows to a spacecraft, and has to jump aboard to save them. Plot The puzzle adventure game takes place in space and in 1920s Norway. The main character is Ruth, a milkmaid living alone with her cows on a farm in a Nordic fjord in the 1920s. The game's story begins with Ruth doing tasks and chores on her farm, longing for a different life after the mysterious disappearance of her mother and death of her father. Then a spaceship flies overhead and abducts her cows from a field. Ruth has to get on the wing of the ship as it flies away, and figures out how to get inside to rescue her friends the cows. Later gameplay involves an intergalactic feud involving an oppressive monarch, and other characters such as an oracle, and space cows. Gameplay The game is a point-and-click adventure game.‚Äù Players start by exploring the farm and surrounding area, encountering various challenges and puzzles. The game allows both running and walking speed. Early tasks include milking cows, patching the roof, making cheese, and also rescuing a lost cow. Puzzle solving is used to get through obstacles, not leveling up, and the skills learned in the first day are useful later on in the game. In between gameplay, there are also animated video clips to move the story along. On day two, the game becomes a science fiction venture concerning alien situations. When a spaceship abducts Ruth‚Äôs cows, Ruth has to get on the wing of the ship as it flies away and figure out how to get inside. Development The game was independently developed by Mattis \\"machineboy\\" Folkestad, a developer in Oslo, Norway.

The game is completely written in rhyme, and is available in English, French, and Norwegian. Reception The Microsoft Windows version of the game was given a score of 74 out of 100 by Metacritic, a review aggregation website.

He renews novel with the reg genre. His related works titled REN uniquely contextualise narratives, philosophical mosaics, speeches, dreams, lyrical and dramatic inserts, and more. \\"It was good to read REN. Hamvas and Kr√∫dy came to my mind. And I saw the continuation of tradition in you book.

Bailey powder puff design, U.S. patent no. 471,680, 1892. Ellene Alice Bailey (1853 ‚Äì July 22, 1897) was an American designer and inventor specializing in clothing and household goods. She patented over a dozen of her many inventions. Biography Ellene Alice Bailey was born in Pond Fort, just south of Wentzville, Missouri, the third daughter of Robert Bailey, a judge, and Lucinda (Zumwalt) Bailey. Early in her career, she moved to New York and built a business from manufacturing her own designs or selling them for outside manufacture. Bailey became a designer of clothing and household goods, as well as an inventor of practical devices. Her first design was the \\"Pond Fort boot\\", a close-fitting, knee-high boot that she patented in both the United States and Canada in 1880. Later clothing designs included a perforated felt chest protector, a sleeve holder, a waterproof leg protector, a detachable brassiere frame, and a corset shield. One of her early inventions was the \\"Dart\\" needle, first patented in 1884. She initially manufactured the Dart needle herself, making the first 60,000 on her own after the man she hired for the job absconded. She later had the needle manufactured by an outside firm. Other practical objects for the home included a holder for rubber overshoes, a manicure case, a photograph album, several clocks, ornamental tables, and a hand pinking device. A number of Bailey's inventions were novelty or seasonal goods, such as a silver whisk broom and a music roll sold as a Christmas card. On occasion, she improved designs originated by other inventors to make them salable. Bailey may have been the first American to patent a powder puff with her 1882 invention of a small drawstring cloth bag with a perforated bottom to distributed the powder evenly. She went on to invent three more variations on her powder puff, the last of them patented in 1892.

This saturation reaction is assisted by a FMN cofactor and the enzyme is a member of the a/√ü-barrel flavoprotein family. The sequence of the enzyme has been obtained from bacteria Pseudomonas putida M10 and has been successfully expressed in yeast and other bacterial species. The enzyme is reported to harbor high sequence and structural similarity to the Old Yellow Enzyme, a large group of flavin- dependent redox biocatalysts of yeast species, and an oestrogen-binding protein of Candida albicans. The enzyme has demonstrated value in biosynthesis of semi-opiate drugs in microorganisms, expanding the chemical diversity of BIA biosynthesis.  Enzyme structure  Morphinone reductase is a dimeric flavoenzyme comprising two 8-fold a/√ü-barrel domains, each with a non- covalently bound FMN prosthetic group located toward the center and C-terminal end of the barrel. At the active site, the Cys-191 residue serves as a proton donor in the oxidative half-reaction with a/√ü unsaturated enones. Residues His-186 and Asn-189 are involved in ligand binding and they represent a conserved feature which is also observed in Old Yellow Enzymes. The residue Arg-238 contributes to a key interaction with the flavin as the side chain of this group is located close to the N-1/C-2 carbonyl region of the flavin isoalloxazine ring, stabilizing the negative charge developed during enzyme reduction. {style=\\"margin: 3 auto;\\"  3D structure of a morphinone reductase single subunit. The non-covalently bound FMN prosthetic group is shown in sticks. PDB ID: 1GWJ. Figure generated by PyMOL.  FMN prosthetic group and key residues at the active site of morphinone reductase. }  Enzyme catalysis  Morphinone reductase takes two substrates, namely morphinone and codeinone, and converts them to hydromorphone and hydrocodone respectively. The catalysis is part of the degradation pathway of morphine and codeine in Pseudomonas putida M10: morphine dehydrogenase and morphinone reductase together form a two-step catalysis converting morphine to hydromorphone, and codeine to hydrocondone. {style=\\"margin: 3 auto;\\"  Initial steps of the morphine degradation pathway in Pseudomonas putida M10.  A proposed reduction mechanism catalyzed by morphinone reductase. } The prosthetic group FMN serves as a cofactor in the redox reaction catalyzed by morphinone reductase. In the reduction of morphinone to hydromorphone, FMNH2 is oxidized to FMN which is then reduced by NADH (and H+) to regenerate FMNH2. Previous studies showed that NADPH could not be used as a reducing agent, which suggested the enzyme's specific toward NADH as a substrate. Studies have shown that the mechanism of flavin reduction in morphinone reductase involve the rapid formation of an E-NADHCT charge-transfer intermediate prior to FMN reduction. It was suggested that the enzyme adapts a two-step kinetic model where the oxidized enzyme (state A) undergoes an enzyme-coenzyme charge-transfer intermediate (state B) before regenerating the reduced form of FMN cofactor (state C). The reduction mechanism involves transfer of a hydride ion from the N5 atom of FMN to 2-cyclohexenone. The other proton donor for the saturation reaction remained uncertain. Steady-state kinetics experiments suggested that morphinone reductase may follow a hybrid two-site, ping-pong kinetic mechanism in which the alkaloid substrates, i.e. morphinone and codeinone, bind independently at separate sites and sequential redox reaction is facilitated by reducing equivalents passed between the binding sites by means of redox- active prosthetic groups, i.e. FMN.  Potential regulatory mechanism  The enzyme was shown to be highly similar to an oestrogen-binding protein from the fungus species Candida albicans, in which the binding of oestrogen prevents the reduction of 2-cyclohexenone. In addition, previous experimental characterization results suggested that morphinone reductase activity is competitively inhibited by progesterone and cortisone, which indicates that the regulatory mechanism of morphinone reductase could be related to its structural resemblance to the oestrogen-binding protein.  Industrial relevance  The enzyme yields hydromorphone and hydrocodone, which are both valuable semi-synthetic opiate drugs. Hydromorphone is a powerful analgesic, which is shown to be more potent than morphine. Hydrocodone is a FDA-approved, mild analgesic and antitussive. Notably, morphine and codeine are natural products of the opiate biosynthetic pathway in opium poppy plant Papaver somniferum. Modern technologies in genetic engineering and metabolic engineering enabled the production of these natural products in microorganisms. Complete biosynthesis of opiate compounds has been achieved in genetically tractable organisms Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. Morphinone reductase was also successfully expressed in these two organisms. The enzyme represents a promising candidate for downstream modifications of opiate compounds, allowing the biosynthesis of valuable semi-synthetic opiate drugs in microorganisms. As an example, morphinone reductase was used as part of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of hydrocodone in yeast.

Life  Sophia was a daughter of Johann Adolf I, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels (1649-1697) by his first wife Johanna Magdalena of Saxe-Altenburg (1656-1686), daughter of Frederick William II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg. This made her a princess of Saxe-Weissenfels and a member of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin. In Leipzig on 16 October 1699 Sophia herself married George William, Margrave of Brandenburg- Bayreuth (1678-1726), who she had met during a visit to the Leipzig Fair earlier the same year. She thus became margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Soon afterwards he founded his own court, giving him the opportunity to build the Schloss Erlangen. Sophia had considerable influence on cultural life in Bayreuth, which was described as the finest venue for singspiel in Germany. Hans Joachim Bauer: Barockoper in Bayreuth, Laaber 1982, S. 5 Sophia brought her love for German-language opera to Weissenfels, making it the only theatre which exclusively showed German-language works. However, her spending on festivities and culture increased the state's debt. In 1705 the foundation stone was laid for a new church in the St. Georgen district of the city - it was dedicated to Hagia Sophia after her. Sophia was described as superficial, and her marriage proved unhappy. Her dalliance with a Swedish baron irritated George William that he attacked the baron at table with a stick and had his wife taken to Plassenburg. Historischer Verein f√ºr Oberfranken zu Bayreuth: Archiv f√ºr Geschichte von Oberfranken, Band 5-6, S. 12 After her husband's death, she moved to Schloss Erlangen, where she lived for 8 years.

To marry him Sophia converted to Catholicism and as a result she was granted an annual pension from the imperial court in Vienna.

The church's foundation stone was laid in 1705. Stone was supplied from twenty nearby and distant quarries and in 1709 the church's outer shell was completed. As George William had hoped, the church was consecrated on the feast day of his name-saint George, 23 April 1711, though some work had to be carried out after consecration.

Influenced by house music, Detroit techno, and disco, she released several recordings on the independent dance music label 100% Silk, including Queen of Cups, Far Away So Close, and Memory of Water, reissued in 2017. KQED named Cherushii's album Meow Wolf‚Äôs Arcade Soundtracks: Wiggy‚Äôs Plasma Plex one of the 10 best Bay Area albums of 2016. Fellow electronic musician Maria Minerva has called Cherushii \\"criminally underrated\\". Dolan was one of 36 victims of a fire that broke out at an underground venue and artist collective in Oakland, California commonly referred to as the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016. Biography Cherushii was born Chelsea Faith Dolan on September 14, 1983. She grew up in Marin County, California and began playing music around the age of 6, when she was gifted a Casio keyboard. She was classically trained at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music as a teenager. After years of written correspondence with Japanese pen pals Chelsea traveled to Japan, where she adopted the moniker Cherushii because it was easier to pronounce than her name. Her introduction to electronic music at raves in the early 2000s set the path for her career as an electronic musician. Cherushii was a champion of women in electronic music and recognized their contributions as a source of influence in a field that often lacks recognition for women. In an interview with Chicago's Reader about the influence of Detroit DJ and producer Kelli Hand (aka K-Hand) Cherushii said \\"I deeply admire her for all the work she's done, and yet her lack of recognition is so discouraging. In a culture as supposedly forward-thinking as electronic music, women are still so often invisible.\\" From January 2014 to December 2016 Cherushii was host of radio shows on UC Berkeley's community radio station KALX, where she devoted sets to Italo Disco, Detroit techno, or contemporaries in the local electronic music scene such as David Last and Roche. In August 2015 Cherushii co-founded a dance music night called Run the Length of Your Wildness to provide a space for local electronic musicians to showcase their music. =Death= Cherushii was scheduled to perform at the Ghost Ship warehouse on December 2, 2016 as part of fellow music producer Golden Donna's (Joel Shanahan) tour. At approximately 11:20 pm a fire started inside the warehouse, trapping attendees inside. The Alameda County Coroner's Bureau confirmed 36 people trapped inside, including Cherushii, died of smoke inhalation. A public memorial was held on December 17, 2016 at Public Works in San Francisco. Music In 2013 Cherushii signed with 100% Silk and released Queen of Cups, a four track album described as an \\"expansive blueprint of slow-burn deep house but threads it through with waves of synth wash, acid flash, and simmering strobe glow, for a loose yet composed suite of 21st-century free-spirit pulse generation.\\" In 2015 Cherushii released Starlight Express, Nobody's Fool, and Far Away So Close, 3 EPs. In 2016 Cherushii released Manic. After Cherushii's death 100% Silk released a memorial edition tape of Memory of Water, previously out of print. =Gear= Cherushii opted for hardware analog gear at a time when laptops were transforming electronic music production and was known to carry heavy suitcases full of equipment to her shows. She used a Yamaha RS7000 before advancing onto the Elektron Octatrack of which she was quoted as saying: \\"Like most Elektron gear, learning to play it is an ongoing journey that you definitely won't complete in the first few months. But its ability to sequence both audio and MIDI makes it a great machine for live sets, and you can't beat its compact size for travel.\\" Cherushii also used the compact Access Virus TI,a digital multitimbral polyphonic synth. Among her gear was also a hand built and highly modified X0xb0x (analog Roland TB-303 hardware clone), which she received as a gift from fellow musicians.

History The property that Pacific Shores Center was developed on had many uses through the years from part of the Redwood City Harbor Company to cement production to being part of saltworks with Leslie Salt. In the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois bought of land adjacent to the Port of Redwood City and Westpoint Slough and formed the Pacific Shores Center Partnership to develop it. After many years of planning Redwood City and the partnership had a complete development agreement with plans for a land swap, that decreased the total property to , and public shore space to allow for public use of parts of the property. In Jay Paul Company entered into an agreement to buy the rights for the project by outbidding several other competing developers with a bid. By early 2000 with the buildings not even complete; Excite@Home, Phone.com, Informatica Corp, and BroadVision Inc. had all signed leases. Demand at the time caused rent prices to increase for the center as well. At this time there were plans for a ferry service to connect San Francisco and Alameda, California to an adjacent ferry terminal to mitigate traffic concerns at the time with so many of the expected workers to be projected commuting. By the burst of the Dot-com bubble had decreased demand for office space and the center previously estimated to fill completely was sitting with a vacancy rate of 65%. However fortunes changed and in late 2006 the campus was sold from Jay Paul to Starwood Capital Group for over for the center which had hit 90% capacity. Tenants at the time included Eidos Interactive, PDL BioPharma, DreamWorks Animation, Threshold Pharmaceutical, Openwave, Symantec, and engineering firm Rudolph and Sletten. The following year two of the buildings, specifically the ones PDL BioPharma was located within, were sold to Shorenstein Properties for an undisclosed sum, for the first time making Pacific Shores Center to have more than one owner. San Mateo County filed a lawsuit in August 2009 over a tax dispute with the Center. County officials claimed that the sale of property in 2006 never had the property transfer taxes paid while the Center argued over the county tax code. Starwood Capital ran into issues with overdue debt in and brought in Blackstone with an ownership stake. Starwood also sold off two of the buildings at the complex to Informatica for . In , Google bought the six buildings, over half the center, at of office space, which Starwood and Blackstone owned, for . Shortly after Google's purchase, Shorenstein Properties sold the two buildings they owned to DivcoWest Properties for about . This has left Pacific Shores Center with fragmented ownership to this day with the three owners all with different sections. Other Pacific Shores Center is used more than just as an area for work. The facilities present include a fitness center that includes a gym, pool, and spa along with playing fields. Public shore access allows for people to park and walk along the Westpoint Slough on a section of the San Francisco Bay Trail. The annual Stanford University Treeathlon triathlon competition is hosted in part at the center along with the Westpoint Harbor.

Early life Pomeroy was born in Astoria, Oregon, and later moved with his parents to the state of Washington. He received his bachelor of science degree from the University of Washington in 1927 where he was a founding member of the Sigma Pi fraternity chapter. He earned his law degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1931. He married Loretta Tyler and they had a daughter, Paula Pomeroy LeFavor, and a son, Allan Merritt Pomeroy. After graduating from law school, Pomeroy became a practicing lawyer. He eventually became a judge and public servant, serving as Justice of the Peace in Kitsap County (1934-1936), acting Seattle municipal judge (1942), assistant United States Attorney for Western Washington (1942-1948), and King County Superior Court judge (1948). Mayor In 1948, Pomeroy was defeated by a slim margin in his first bid for the mayor's office by incumbent Mayor William F. Devin. The defining issue of the election had been Devin's Tolerance Policy where small time gambling was tolerated. Devin (and Police Chief Eastman) said this was the best deterrent to major vice and police corruption. Pomeroy said this was an official acceptance of illegality. He promised to end the practice and get rid of Eastman. This promise led to enough voters switching sides for Pomeroy to win the 1952 election by a small margin. He named H.J. Lawrence as Police Chief and said that card rooms would no longer be permitted. Pomeroy was credited with making Seattle a well known city by bringing the World's Fair to the city in 1962. Pomeroy had to bring in community and business leaders, as well as a petition campaign, to convince the city council to approve an $8.5 million bond issue to build the opera house and sports center needed to attract the fair. Eventually the council approved a $7.5 million bond issue with the state matching that amount. In 1952, Pomeroy cut the ribbon opening the Alaskan Way Viaduct. In April 1954, during the Seattle windshield pitting epidemic police in the Seattle area were swamped with calls of car windshields being pitted. Close to 3,000 windshields had been reported as being pitted, and no one knew what to do. Under pressure, Pomeroy first wired Washington Governor Arthur B. Langlie, then President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking for assistance. Many theories were put forth for the cause of the damage but an investigation by the Seattle Police Department determined that most of the damage was to the windshields of older cars. In cases were auto lots were involved, brand new cars were unpitted; used cars were. The damage had been there all along, it had just gone unnoticed. Sergeant Max Allison of the Seattle Police crime laboratory declared that all the damage reports were \\"5 percent hoodlum-ism, and 95 percent public hysteria.\\" Area residents had become participants in a collective delusion. Within a couple of days reports of damage had ceased. In 1955, Pomeroy appointed the Mayor's Advisory Committee on Police Practices to investigate charges of police brutality. The committee condemned police practices in the predominantly black Central District neighborhood. As a result, a program was started to improve police relations with the black community. Several police officers participated in intercultural workshops sponsored by the Seattle Public Schools and others were enrolled in race relations classes at Seattle University. The effectiveness of the program was questioned by many. In 1956 Pomeroy lost his re-election bid to Gordon S. Clinton. Pomeroy and Police Chief Lawrence's inability to close down the card rooms were a major reason for Clinton's victory. The ousting of an incumbent mayor is rare in Seattle. It wouldn't happen again until Greg Nickels beat Paul Schell in 2001. After politics After losing the mayor's race Pomeroy went back to practicing law. At the time of his death he was a senior partner in the law firm of Pomeroy, Zelensky, Furnia, and Munro. He was a member of several clubs and societies, including the Moose Lodge, Fraternal Order of Eagles, Kiwanis Club, the Sons of Norway and the Alaska-Yukon Pioneers. He also served as Exalted Ruler of the Seattle Elks. He died on July 7, 1966, of a heart attack in his Seattle home, at the age of 59.

The buildings are late 17th century although the institution developed from an earlier Augustinian community. The chapel was completed by 1671, date in which it was consecrated; and in 1677, year of the death of the convent's patron Cardinal Don Pascual de Arag√≥n, the works of the conventual dependences were practically finished.  Description of church  Although the church's crossing, in its lateral development, protrudes slightly in floor, the plan cannot be described as a Latin cross, it is essentially rectangular with a single nave divided in three sections: the crossing, the greater chapel and the choir, high, at the feet, on a wide lowered arch. The nave and the main chapel have half-barrel vaulted ceilings and lunettes; In the transept, dome on pechinas (pendentives), without drum and with blind lantern. On a base of ashlar masonry, there is a limpid and undeveloped interior elevation, articulated by Tuscan pilasters that, extended on the smooth frieze, reach the capitals located directly under the cornices. Four buttresses support the dome in the crossing. Regarding this, the presbytery is slightly elevated, where the pilasters of articulation appear subtly boxed; On its front, the main altarpiece; On the side of the epistle, the fence that gives to the low choir of the nuns - wide rectangular stay and of low height, whose low ceiling is materially occupied by an enormous shield, frescoed by Francisco Rizi, of the Cardinal Pascual de Arag√≥n, and on the gospel side, the chapel of the Christ. Fine simplicity and marked desornamentation are the criteria handled throughout the interior. The counterpart is in the nobility of materials - marble, jaspers and bronzes - used for altarpieces, picture frames and plaques with inscriptions. Each of the details that configure this architectural space is executed with a weighting, exquisiteness and a final finish that surprise; Fruit, all of it, of a measured proportion and balance. The exterior is, in general, of brick seen with rafters of stone, of cubic volumes and rectilinear profiles, as is customary in the 17th-century architecture of Toledo.  Other buildings  Among the conventual dependences is to note the small cloister, which acts as a distributing element of rooms, formed by two floors, four galleries each, which, through arches of half a point, open to a courtyard.  Paintings  The walls of the nave are decorated with paintings by Sim√≥n de Le√≥n Leal, which represents Ferdinand III the Saint before Saint Hermenegild (1670), and of Carlo Francesco Nuvolone (before 1646), represents the \\"Assumption of the Virgin\\", Giovanni Peruzzini, Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis, and Giacinto Giminiani, Apparition of the Child to Santa Rosa de Lima, both signed in 1670.Nicolau Castro, Juan, \\"A work signed by the Madrilenian painter Sim√≥n Le√≥n de Leal and details of other paintings in Toledo\\", \\"Bulletin of the Seminar of Studies in Art and Archeology\\", t. 58, 1992, pp. 425-430. √öbeda de los Cobos, Andr√©s, The Assumption of the Virgin by Carlo Francesco Nuvolone restored in the Prado Museum, Bulletin of the Museo del Prado, t.

She completed twenty-five murals and seven sculptures throughout Chicago, as part of the art projects for the New Deal's Section of Painting and Sculpture. Later, she completed seventeen ceramic murals for the 3rd Unitarian Church, which was designated as a Chicago Landmark in 1960. In addition to her artwork and exhibitions, Kauffman taught art for forty-one years at various universities in Chicago, Rockford, Illinois and Valparaiso, Indiana. Early life Camille Andrene Kauffman was born on April 19, 1905 in Chicago, Cook County, Illinois to Charlotte Camille (n√©e Henriksen) and George Francis Kauffman Kauffman came from an artistic family. Her father was a dress designer and her paternal grandfather, Francis Xavier Kauffman designed furniture. Her brother G. Francis would become a cartoonist and illustrator. She attended Austin Community Academy High School of Chicago before entering the Art Institute of Chicago, graduating in 1926 and winning the John Quincy Adams Fellowship from the Institute for a year of continued study abroad. In 1927, Kauffman went to Paris, where she studied with Andr√© Lhote and traveled throughout Europe, before returning in 1928 to take up a teaching post at Valparaiso University. Career Kauffman was hired as a professor of Painting and drawing at the Art Institute of Chicago upon her return and simultaneously worked instructing art at Valparaiso University. Both assignments were part time and in 1933, when she was approached by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), she joined the federal program. During her time with the WPA, Kauffman produced over 50 easel paintings, 25 murals and 7 sculpture projects earning $24.50 per week. Some of her first works for the WPA were murals painted for the Brookfield Zoo, which was under construction at the time. Between 1936 and 1940, Kauffman painted four murals for the cafeteria of the Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School including Amusement Park, Circus, Rodeo, and Stock Show The murals were painted over with housepaint, but the outlines of the canvases are visible on the walls and might be able to be restored. In 1937, Kauffman painted Incidents in the Life of Luther Burbank for the Luther Burbank School. The following year, she completed a second mural at the school, Circus. The murals at Burbank were still extant in 2001. The playground houses at Oak Park, Illinois contain Kaufman's bas relief sculptures depicting fairy tales. These included a cast stone relief based on Thumbelina by Hans Christian Andersen, at the Watts Playground on Hayes Avenue at Division Street; a stone sculpture titled The Cutting of the Cake based on Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, for the Lincoln Playground at Kenilworth Avenue and Fillmore Street; and a cast stone work Captain Flint based on Robert Louis Stevenson's character at the Pyott Playground on Lake Street at Taylor Avenue. She painted murals at the Cook County Children's Hospital, but they were destroyed when the building was demolished. Kauffman created two bas reliefs for the Lincoln Elementary School in Evanston, Illinois. Children in Fruit Tree and Monkeys are intricate wood carvings with three-dimensional style. In addition, she completed commissions at the Washington School in Evanston and the Lowell School in Oak Park, as well as a mural for the Forest Park Public Library. In 1940, Kauffman won the federal commission to paint Preparation for the First County Fair in Ida Grove‚Äì1872 for the post office mural in Ida Grove, Iowa. During her time with the WPA project, Kauffman earned her bachelor's degree in Fine Arts in 1939 and completed her Master of Fine Arts in 1941. In 1943, when the WPA project ended, Kauffman resigned her teaching post at Valparaiso University and took a position as an aircraft engineering drafter in a war plant. When the war ended, she returned to teaching, taking a position at Rockford College as the chair of the art department, while still teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1947, she designed the Jane Addams medal for Rockford to be awarded to students for distinguished service. Taking a sabbatical to study ceramics in 1951 at the Art Institute, she returned as an associate professor to Rockford in 1952. She completed two ceramic murals that year, Deduction and Induction, which were installed on either side of the entrance of the new science building at the university. In 1955, Kauffman began a series of seventeen murals for the Third Unitarian Church, for which she also designed a large stained glass window, which is the dominant feature of the south wall of the building. The first ceramic tile portrait was of Woodrow Wilson and was unveiled as part of the centennial celebrations for Wilson's birth. The last portrait was of Roger Williams and was completed in 1963. Kauffman retired in 1967 from the Art Institute, but continued working and exhibiting her works. She held a one-woman show at the Vanderpoel Art Gallery in 1971, painted a mural for the Viola Gitzel Memorial Addition to the Forest Park Library in 1972, and was part of a three-artist exhibit at Loyola University in 1985. One of her works was chosen in 1990 from a state-wide competition, to hang in Chicago's State of Illinois Building. Death and legacy Kauffman died on July 4, 1993 in Chicago. Throughout her lifetime, her works were exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, Riverside Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, as well as at numerous galleries in Chicago. The Third Unitarian Church of Chicago, known as the \\"church of the murals\\" because of Kauffman's artwork has been designated a Chicago architectural landmark. Photographs of the murals were displayed in New York and at an exhibit hosted by the U.S. National Society of Mural Painters in Moscow, at the College of Industrial and Applied Arts.

Work was initially led by Antonio della Porta and after his death in 1702 by Gottfried von Gedeler. It was the first baroque building built from scratch in Franconia. Christian Ernst moved his third wife Margravine Elisabeth Sophie of Brandenburg into the Schloss in 1703 when it was still incomplete, giving it its initial name, the Elisabethenburg. Behind it was a 280 metre wide and 550 metre long garden with an orangery (completed in 1706), the Konkordienkirche (completed in 1706, now the Geological Institute), the Hugenottenbrunnen fountain, an equestrian statue and a now-lost Sylvan theater. After a short time as a princely residence, the castle served as a widow's residence until the early 19th century. It suffered several fires in the 18th century and on 14 January 1814 a final serious fire broke out in a roof space filled with rubbish - it could not be extinguished since the temperature was -25 ¬∞ C and the water froze in the hoses and even once the water had been heated the syringes could not pump it high enough. The castle was completely destroyed and only its furniture was saved.

This species is endemic to Kenya, and grows in along roads and other open treaded places in the forest zones the central highlands of Kenya.  Taxonomy  In 1902, Spencer Le Marchant Moore was the first to describe this species of sunfleck as Coreopsis jacksonii, based on a specimen collected by Frederick John Jackson from the Kiambu County in Kenya in 1899. John Hutchinson assigned a plant collected by Battiscombe from the Aberdare Range in Nyandarua County to the genus Guizotia and called it G. reptans. Earl Edward Sherff described in 1923 a plant from the western slopes of Mount Kenya, found by Mearns, as Bidens spathulata. By 1926 he had realised it was identical to Moore's species, but as he thought it better placed in Bidens, he made the new combination B. jacksonii. Robert Elias Fries collected a slightly different specimen in 1928 that he called Guizotia reptans var. keniensis, while Sherff also had a plant he regarded as sufficiently divergent and called it Coreopsis jacksonii var. arthrochaeta in 1929. It wasn't until 1974 that J. Baag√∏e synonymised all of these names, and had to create the new combination Guizotia jacksonii to satisfy the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. cited on  Description  Guizotia jacksonii is a low (about 1 cm high) perennial, herbaceous, creeping plant, which branches sparingly, each hairless stem 3‚Äì30 cm long, that makes roots at the nodes and sometimes forms clumps. The leaves are set opposite along the stem and may be unequal to each other, lacking a leaf stalk, oval in shape 1‚Äì6¬º cm long and ¬Ω‚Äì2¬Ω cm wide, merged at the narrowed foot with the opposing leaf. The edge of the leaf has distanced and very small teeth ending in a gland, and are often rolled back. There may be some hairs on the leaf or only on the veins. The flowerheads sit individually in the axil of the leaves near the tip and stand on a stalk of ¬Ω‚Äì3 cm long. The involucre is ¬æ‚Äì1¬º cm long, the individual bract with a row of hairs along the rim. The scales (or paleas) set on the common base of the florets (called receptacle) at the foot of each floret are yellowish and up to 3 mm long. Each flowerhead has four to nine yellow ray florets on the outside with a tube of 2 mm long, and a strap of ¬æ‚Äì1¬Ω cm long, tipped with three teeth. In the middle are seven to thirteen disc florets, each 3¬æ‚Äì5 mm long. The ripe indehiscent and one-seeded fruits (called cypselas) are brown in color and 3¬Ω mm long. There is no hairy or scaly pappus present. The species has thirty chromosomes (2n=30).  Distribution  Guizotia jacksonii is an endemic of Mount Elgon, Cherangani Hills Forest, the Aberdare Range, Mau Forest and Mount Kenya, where it occurs between 2350‚Äì3900 m altitude.

Logging historians, such as Stewart Holbrook, Robert Pike, and others, have called him \\"the last lumberjack\\" of the old-fashioned type who \\"cut a swath of timber from Maine to Oregon\\" and \\"yelled like crazy devils every spring when they pounded the bars in Bangor, Saginaw, St. Paul, and Seattle\\". The U.S. Forest Service maintains the Jigger Johnson Campground in the White Mountain National Forest, which they named in honor of him. Early life Albert \\"Jigger\\" Johnson was born on May 12, 1871, in Fryeburg, Maine to parents of Yankee stock. According to legend, when Jigger was born he came out of his mother's womb with a wad of tobacco in his lip, caulk boots on his feet, and a peavey in one hand and an axe in the other.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . Another legend states that he only had two formal days of schooling. On the first day, the Jigger forgot his books, and on the second day the teacher was out sick. At the young age of 12, he went to work in the woods as a \\"cookee\\", or cook's assistant, at a lumber camp in Milan, New Hampshire. Jigger's duties as cookee required him to help the cook prepare food, serve the loggers their meals, clean the dishes after mealtime, and to chop fire wood during any spare time. During meals, it was forbidden for the loggers to converse with one another, due to it interfering with the cook and cookee's job. One evening, a few newcomers decided to talk during dinner, and continued to talk after the young Jigger politely asked them to stop. One logger started arguing with the boy Jigger, and the next thing the loggers knew was that the youth had jumped onto the fully grown man and sunk his teeth into his ear. After the other men separated the two, part of the man's ear remained in Jigger's mouth.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. The other loggers were so impressed that a young boy would even attempt to take on a fully grown man that they all combined a portion of their wages and bought the Jigger a can of chewing tobacco.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . Later loggers would say that because of this, men who fought Jigger would never caulk his face, from fear of his teeth. Logging career The young Jigger soon worked his way up the ranks in the woods - swamping roads, tending landing, and chopping, to eventually emerge at the age of 20 as head chopper in charge of a logging camp somewheres on the Androscoggin River. Old loggers who worked for him, such as Stewart Holbrook, claimed that Johnson had few equals as a woodsman at a time when a man working in the woods was judged by the smoothness of the scarf of his axe‚Äôs undercut. They said that the Jigger was an unusually good logger and that he could fell a tree uphill, downhill, with or against the wind, even so that upon falling it would drive a stake previously set in the ground. Johnson worked for many years as a logging foreman in the woods of Co√∂s County, New Hampshire for the Connecticut Valley Lumber Company (C.V.L) in the winter, and as a river boss on the Connecticut River in the spring. Robert E. Pike claimed in his 1967 book, Tall Trees, Tough Men, that whenever Jigger entered the camp of a new logging operation, for his resume he would exclaim, \\"I can jump higher, squat lower, turn sideways quicker, and spit further than any son-of-a-bitch in a camp.\\"Pike, Robert E. (1967). Tall Trees, Tough Men, W. W. Norton & Company, New York. . As a foreman, Jigger was known to have kicked off the knots of a frozen hemlock log barefooted, and supposedly wouldn't hire anyone else who couldn't do the same.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. He was well known to be an honest, hardworking boss, who would pay his men high wages to work for him. He would walk into saloons at Berlin, New Hampshire and Sherbrooke, Quebec and could convince drunken loggers to work for him driving logs down the most dangerous parts of the Connecticut River.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . Although he paid his men handsomely, he expected a lot from them. On one occasion during a river drive, Jigger told his men to wait at camp while he went to recruit more log drivers in West Stewartstown, New Hampshire. Some of his workers disobeyed his orders and went down to the Line House on the Beecher Falls‚ÄìEast Hereford Border Crossing.Holbrook, Stewart (1961). Yankee Loggers: A Recollection of Woodsmen, Cooks, and River Drivers, The International Paper Company, New York. . Once he returned to camp, Jigger realized at once where the missing men had gone and immediately left for the Line House. Upon entering the Line House, the Jigger grabbed a peavey that was hung on the wall, and ran into the crowd swinging. The bouncer, a bulky French-Canadian by the name of Lapointe, then knocked Johnson to the ground and began stomping him with his cork boots. Jigger managed to grab a hold of Lapointe's feet and lifted him up and placed him onto a hot wood stove and held him there for a few minutes, all the while Lapointe bellowed.Pike, Robert E. (1959). Spiked Boots: Sketches of the North County, W. W. Norton & Company, New York. . When Jigger finally let up, he proceeded to jump into the air and grabbed a hold of a kerosene lamp from the ceiling and smashed it over the bouncer's head. The kerosene met the heat and ignited Lapointe's clothes. Lapointe ran outside, still ablaze, and had to be put out by bystanders, while Jigger's frightened men returned to camp. In his younger years, Jigger Johnson boasted that he would not leave any tree standing from Bangor to Seattle, nor any virgins.Holbrook, Stewart (1938).

Forest Log, Oregon Department of Forestry, Salem, Oregon, 1931. Johnson worked on the Connecticut River for the C.V.L. until 1915, when the last long-log drive occurred. He then continued to work for the remainder of his logging career on the Androscoggin River. Sensing that the long-log drives were coming to an end, Jigger retired from working in the woods in the early 1920s.  Fire warden and the Civilian Conservation Corps Shortly after the end of his logging career, Jigger Johnson found a profession as a fire warden for the United States Forest Service and was stationed at their lookout tower on Mount Chocorua, and later at Carter Dome.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. It was there that Johnson, when sober, looked for forest fires. On days when he drank, mostly when the weather was rainy, he clogged up the telephone lines with reports of bizarre snakes and small dragons,Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. .Langlois, D. \\"Coffee Grounds\\", Dappled Grass, Concord, New Hampshire, 2006. a rare condition caused by extreme alcohol abuse known as alcoholic hallucinosis. On one occasion while the Jigger worked on Carter Dome, he and a friend, Robert Monahan, set off from \\"The Dome\\" to Berlin to replenish his potato supply and to stock up on bootlegged hard liquor.Burbank, Rob. \\"Fire Towers of Old\\", The Mountain Ear newspaper, Salmon Press, Wolfeboro Falls, New Hampshire, 1988. When they reached the town of Gorham, they stumbled upon a celebration that included a potato race. Bob and Jigger banded together and won the race, with the prize being a half-bushel of fresh potatoes. He and Monahan then lugged the sack of potatoes up to Carter Dome, where the two men had a feast.Monahan, Robert. \\"The Jigger\\", Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, 1975. After the U.S. Forest Service was forced to let him go due to his drinking, Johnson was hired to man a privately owned fire tower on Bald Mountain in Maine. However, this job did not last too long due to a conflagration that burnt down the tower, which was caused by one of Jigger's homemade alcohol stills exploding.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . After this, Jigger was hired to teach survival skills for the Civilian Conservation Corps in Gilead, Maine.Holbrook, Stewart (1938). Holy Old MacKinaw: A Natural History of the American Lumberjack, The Macmillan Company, New York. . It is there that the Jigger entranced the young men with his tales of old. The CCC, like the Forest Service, was forced to relieve him because of his heavy alcohol consumption, which forced the Jigger into finally deciding to go into self- employment as a trapper of wild game. Trapper Jigger's final job before his death was fur trapping. He erected a crude cabin in the White Mountain National Forest near Douglas Brook in Albany, New Hampshire. As a trapper, Johnson was known to have been somewhat of a one-man Hudson's Bay Company, catching lynx, bobcat, mink, muskrat, weasel, fox, and fisher, often alive and with nothing but his own hands.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. Once, the Jigger used a deer carcass to lure two bobcats under a tree that he had climbed. While the bobcats were having their feast, Johnson pounced on them and bagged them, live, barehanded. One of these cats was sold to the University of New Hampshire, which wanted a wildcat for use as a mascot, for the sum of $50. On another occasion, a man from Portland, Maine asked the Jigger if he could catch him two bobcats for a show he was doing, and if he could, he would pay him $25. Jigger agreed, and captured two bobcats and tied their feet together and started out for the train station, occasionally hitting their heads together to keep them quiet. Johnson asked the stationmaster how much it would cost to ship the cats to Portland, and after about ten minutes, the stationmaster revealed to Jigger that there wasn't any tariff on shipping bobcats, thus he could not ship them. Johnson ended up hiring a taxi driver to drive him to Portland, and he hand delivered the cats himself. Death After selling a lynx pelt for the sum of $100, the Jigger went to the town of Conway to celebrate. The next morning, after realizing he had not checked his traps in over 24 hours (as state laws required), Johnson hired a man to drive him back to Passaconaway. The car ended up sliding off the road just as the Jigger was about to get out of the car, pinning him to a tree. Jigger was taken to the Memorial Hospital in Conway, where he died on March 30, 1935. Legacy Following his death, Jigger Johnson was made famous by writers, such as Stewart Holbrook and Robert Pike, for his extraordinary intuition, tolerance to cold weather, ability to consume massive amounts of any proof alcohol, and his enormous strength.Monahan, Robert. \\"Jigger Johnson\\", New Hampshire Profiles magazine, Northeast Publications, Concord, New Hampshire, April, 1957. It is through the recounting of the Jigger's numerous off-the-job exploits by these historians that the Jigger has become somewhat of an American folk hero.Appalachia Appalachian Mountain Club, 1964. In the 1940 Warner Brothers film King of the Lumberjacks, there is a character played by Joe Sawyer named \\"Jigger\\", who is loosely based on Jigger Johnson. In 1969, the United States Forest Service opened the Jigger Johnson Campground in the White Mountain National Forest, near where the Jigger once trapped, which they named in his honor.

Marianne Nicolson (‚ÄòTayagila‚Äôogwa; born 1969) is a Dzawada‚Äôenuxw visual artist whose work explores the margins at which public access to First Nations artifacts clashes with the preservation of indigenous cultural knowledge. Born in Comox, British Columbia, she was trained by a master carver in traditional Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw design in the early 1990s. She utilizes painting, photography, mixed-media, sculpture, and installation to create modern depictions of traditional Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw beliefs, and has exhibited in Canada and throughout the world since 1992.  Personal life  Marianne Nicolson was born in 1969, in Comox, British Columbia to a Kwakwaka'wakw First Nations mother of the Dzawada'enuxw descent, and a Scottish immigrant father from Stornoway. She decided to become an artist when she was five years old. Nicolson is an outspoken advocate for Indigenous land rights, and integrates this in her artwork. Nicolson is involved in her community, both as a Nunwakola Cultural Society board member and through artistic projects. One community project in 2019 gathered over 55 participants, young and old, connected to the Musgamakw Dzawada‚Äôenuxw (part of the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw First Nations). As part of a fish farming protest, Nicolson and the participants created a pictograph series. These pictographs were not only community building but they also played off her cliff painting from 1998. She currently lives in the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw community of Kingcome Inlet, BC (Dzawada‚Äôenuxw people), after moving there in the 1990s.  Education  In 1996, Nicolson graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. She continued her education at the University of Victoria (UVIC) in 1999, receiving her Master of Fine Arts. In 2005, after returning to UVIC, she graduated with a Masters in Linguistics and Anthropology. Later on, she received her PhD in Anthropology and Art History, also from UVIC. She also studied the Kwak‚Äôwala language and directed research investigating the link between indigenous language and indigenous worldview.  Awards  * Emily Award- In 2019 Nicolson received Emily Carr University's Emily Award, which honours outstanding achievements by university alumni. * Fulmer Award of Distinction- She also received the Fulmer Award of Distinction in 2019. An award that recognizes individuals who have made a profound contribution to their First Nations culture.  Artistic career  Her practice is multi-disciplinary encompassing photography, painting, carving, video, installation, monumental public art, writing and speaking. All her work is political in nature and seeks to uphold Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw traditional philosophy and worldview through contemporary mediums and technology. Marianne Nicolson has exhibited in many countries. Such galleries and exhibitions include the 17th Biennale of Sydney, The Vancouver Art Gallery, The National Museum of the American Indian, Nuit Blanche in Toronto, Museum Arnhem and many others. Major monumental public artworks are situated in Vancouver International Airport, the Canadian Embassy in Amman, Jordan and the Canadian Embassy in Paris, France. = Cliff Painting = Marianne Nicolson's artistic career was established after the completion of her Cliff Painting in her traditional homeland of Kingcome Inlet in 1998. The pictograph, which covers a surface of 28 by 38 foot on 120 foot cliff makes reference to the history of the Dzawada‚Äòenuxw tribe of the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw First Nations. It is the first mural to be completed in sixty years, celebrating the strength of her community of Gwa‚Äôyi. A copper design represents wealth, and the Kawadilikala, the Dzawada'enuxw ancestor is also depicted while carrying a treasure box with the sun on it.  Major Exhibitions  =Bax'wana'tsi - The Container for Souls= This instillation was held at Artspeak, in Vancouver, BC from January 7 to February 11, 2006 and later held from October 19 to November 18, 2006 at Gallery 101, in Ottawa, ON. Nicolson's piece, a light box that casts shadows on the surrounding walls of a raven, owl and two girls ‚Äî the artist's aunt and mother as young women, took up the entire gallery. Viewers become part of the work and part of the history it tells. The box holds the possibility for purification and healing for a landscape ravaged by the visitor, carrying the memories of Aboriginal life and community. = The House of the Ghosts = Nicolson transformed the Vancouver Art Gallery into a Northwest Coast Ceremonial House for the exhibition. This site-specific projection ran from October 4th to January 11th, 2009. The gallery used to be a former Provincial courthouse, through this piece Nicolson gives hope to the survival of Pacific Northwest Coast First Nations cultures and communities, despite active efforts to suppress and eradicate them. =Walking on Water (Thin Ice)= Exhibited at Equinox Gallery from April 6th to May 4th 2013, Nicolson's sculptural installation Walking on Water (Thin Ice) features a myriad of blue glass sculptures inserted into wooden supports. These glass shapes take the form of killer whale fins which, in Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw tradition, signify healing. Other Northwest Coast symbols are featured, such as owls, which carry the spirits of the deceased according to Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw principles, and also are becoming extinct as a result of habitat loss. The installation addresses issues of global warming through responding to a devastating flood that occurred in Kingcome Inlet. The title Walking on Water (Thin Ice) touches on this, inferring collective social denial and the repercussions they will inevitably face. =A Precarious State= This major installation consisted of a 6'x35' lit blue glass wall, which bears the carved image of a sinking killer whale being ridden by figures. The whale looks strained and it is not clear whether the figures are the source of the whale drowning or if they are drowning with the whale.This installation was commissioned by the Canadian Embassy in Amman, Jordan, in 2013 = Foolmakers in the Setting Sun (Ni‚Äônu≈Çamgila le‚Äôe Banistida \`T≈Çisala) = Foolmakers in the Setting Sun (Ni‚Äônu≈Çamgila le‚Äôe Banistida\`T≈Çisala), exhibited in 2014 at Gallery 2 in Grand Forks, British Columbia, depicts the dan\`tsikw (powerboards) that serve as spiritual powers during the 'tukwid, a traditional Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw ritual. Illustrations of a ghost and two nu≈Çamgila (foolmakers) are carved onto the three glass boards. Light is sent off onto the boards, simulating the sunset, producing shadows of the carved ghosts, which grow taller until they pass through an image of the Alberta Tar Sands on the wall at dusk. Foolmakers in the Setting Sun addresses how global warming and environmental contamination as a result of the pipeline project would destroy the planet, through the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw worldview =The Rivers Monument= Her art piece titled The Rivers Monument has been installed at the A-B Connector at Vancouver International Airport, since January 2015. The Rivers Monument consists of two 8.5 m-tall blue glass poles, similar to totem poles on the Northwest Coast, enclosed by a water feature and an oval wooden bench at the base. Displaying indigenous designs inside the glass, the two poles represent the Columbia River and the Fraser River, revealing their respective histories concerning how European colonizers‚Äô construction of dams greatly reduced the salmon population and obliterated thousands of indigenous pictographs. Marianne Nicolson has expressed optimism about the YVR for selecting her \\"very political\\" artwork for the connector, \\"[pushing] their own boundaries slightly\\" and raising awareness about indigenous peoples and their histories. = AWI'NAGWISKASU: Real Land = April 21 - July 2, 2017, The exhibit was curated by Jesse Birch and Liz Park and featured the artists' scope via paintings, installations and video. The works therein represented concerns/fears about the surrounding waters of the community. = Tunics of the Changing Tide: = In her 2007 painting Tunics of the Changing Tide, exhibited at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2017, Nicolson has illustrated two garments bearing the figures of a Thunderbird, a mink, a snake, and a tree. Outlines of ravens, wolves, and people are painted in the background, and objects such as coppers and coins, representing wealth and status, are attached on the surface. As its title implies, Nicolson's painting draws attention to the experiences of the Kwikwasut‚Äôinuxw and DzawadaÃ±‚ÄôenuxÃ±w in terms of their economic growth and decline due to colonization, and makes reference to the swing from the flourishing economy of the 1880s to the downfall of the Northwest Coast nations in the 1920s due to potlatch ban legislation. A 1929 coin on the Thunderbird denotes the revival of cultural traditions amongst the KwakwaÃ±kaÃ±‚Äôwakw, and their resistance against assimilation. = To refuse, to wait, to sleep = The exhibition To refuse, to wait, to sleep was held at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2017. Nicolson's piece \\"The Sun is Setting on the British Empire\\" was commissioned for the exhibition. She reworks the British Columbia provincial flag by repositioning and inverting the Union Jack below a setting/rising sun that has been recreated in the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw style. Nicolson references the flag's original orientation (1895-1906); while the early version shows the sun atop the Union Jack and suggests a cooperative situation and mutually beneficial alliances between the crown and Indigenous nations, these emblems were reversed in 1906 and symbolically reveal a relationship of oppression, theft and genocide. By righting the symbols of the flag back to their original relationship, Nicolson's banner instills hope for and assertion of Indigenous rights over the land, which today remain largely unresolved. It was installed on the exterior of the Belkin and remains there as an outdoor art piece. = Waterline = Nicolson's work Waterline, exhibited in 2018 at the Birmingham Museum of Art, gives focus to sacred and life-sustaining waterways. The form of the sculpture is derived from traditional bentwood boxes. The images that are presented as the light moves up and down, mimicking the tidal flow of waters, show animals and symbols important to Nicolson's Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw heritage. The installation references ancient Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw cliff pictographs that are in danger of being lost because of industrial structures now control the rise and fall of river-water levels and indigenous sites, causing ancient Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw pictographs on cliffs and river rocks to disappear under rising water, and then reemerge. = Hexsa'am: To Be Here Always = Exhibited at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in 2019, Hexsa'am: To Be Here Always aims to foreground Dzawada'enuxw First Nation's lawsuit to extend Indigenous land title to waters in order to fight Marine Harvest Canada and Cermaq Canada fish farms in the Broughton Archipelago near Kingcome Inlet. The lawsuit and exhibition raises issues about Indigenous jurisdiction, land and water \\"in a way that journalism or political protest in the streets do not\\".

Susan Frowde was born in East Knoyle in Wiltshire in 1756, the daughter of James Frowde Esq., a local gentleman. She met Pellew in 1782 and they married on 28 May 1783 when she was aged eighteen and he twenty-six. The couple lived in Truro, Cornwall, for a short period after their marriage before moving to New Road in Flushing, close to Falmouth where Susan's brother-in-law Samuel Pellew was Collector of Customs. Susan and her husband had six children: * Emma Mary Pellew (18 January 1785 ‚Äì March 1835) * Pownoll Bastard Pellew, later 2nd Viscount Exmouth (1 July 1786 ‚Äì 2 December 1833) * Julia Pellew (28 November 1787 ‚Äì 26 December 1831) * Fleetwood Broughton Reynolds Pellew, later an admiral and knight (13 December 1789 ‚Äì 28 July 1861) * George Pellew, Dean of Norwich (3 April 1793 ‚Äì 13 October 1866) * Edward William Pellew, later a minister (3 November 1799 ‚Äì 29 August 1869) After Pellew was knighted for defeating the French frigate Cl√©op√¢tre in the Action of 18 June 1793, King George III awarded Susan a ¬£150 annuity from the Privy Purse to cover additional household expenses associated with her husband's new title. Susan later became Lady Exmouth, when Pellew was made Baron Exmouth of Canonteign in 1814. In 1797, as her husband's fame increased following the Action of 13 January 1797, when Pellew's frigate HMS Indefatigable and her consort HMS Amazon defeated the French 74-gun ship Droits de l'Homme, Susan and the family moved from their terraced house in Flushing to the rented Trefusis Manor. Susan was a devoted wife who supported her husband's naval career, managed their estate and raised their family during his absences at sea; however, she vehemently opposed his political ambitions and when he was appointed MP for Barnstaple in 1802 she refused to accompany him to London. When Pellew was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station in 1805, Susan chose to remain in England with her family. Though the couple were apart for five years, they maintained a regular correspondence. While Pellew was serving in the East Indies, Susan took in a young woman in reduced circumstances, Jane Smith, who came to regard Susan and Pellew as her adopted parents. In 1804 Susan bought the family's first property, Hampton House in Plymouth. She lived there until 1811 when she sold the property to the Reverend Robert Hawker. In 1812 Susan purchased two new properties for the family: Canonteign House, where her eldest son Pownoll lived with his wife Eliza, and West Cliffe House (now Bitton House) in Teignmouth where she and her husband resided after his retirement, with various children and grandchildren, until his death in 1833. Susan disapproved of the posthumous biography of Pellew, commissioned by his brother Samuel and written by Edward Osler, and she burned the majority of her husband's personal correspondence.

Luetta Elmina (Bumstead) Braumuller (December 4, 1856 ‚Äì December 13, 1898) was an artist and publisher who founded the periodical The China Decorator. Biography Luetta Elmina Bumstead was born in Monson, Massachusetts, in 1856, the fourth of six children of Colonel Arnold Bumstead and Elmina M. Bumstead. Developing an early interest in art, she made several trips to Europe to study art, in 1880 (Berlin), 1882 (Berlin, Paris, and S√®vres), 1889 (Dresden), and 1890 (Paris). She studied drawing and painting, especially painting on porcelain and glass painting. She married Otto L. Braumuller, a New York piano manufacturer; they had two children, Herman and Bertha. In the United States, she taught ceramic art and in 1882 published a handbook entitled Lessons in China Painting. Feeling that a periodical would find a wider readership, in 1887 she founded The China Decorator, a monthly magazine devoted to the art of china painting. A success from its first issue, it had a large circulation in both the United States and Europe. Braumuller developed a reputation of one of the country's experts in modern porcelain and pottery, and her magazine spurred a surge of interest in china painting in the United States. After her death at the age of 42 in 1898, the magazine continued for a year under the direction of her husband and son.

He specialized in the study of colloids. Early life and education Bartell was born on June 16, 1883 in Concord, Michigan. He was an undergraduate at Albion College and graduated in 1905. After a short period as an instructor of chemistry at Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, Bartell returned to Michigan and began graduate studies in chemistry at the University of Michigan. He received his Ph.D. in 1910. Academic career After finishing his Ph.D., Bartell remained at the University of Michigan as faculty, reaching full professorship in 1924. Bartell's research and teaching were focused on colloid chemistry and included the development of one of the first courses on the topic in United States universities, first offered in 1913. This course led to the publication of widely used and well-regarded laboratory manual in colloid chemistry. Among those undergraduate chemistry students recruited to assist with Bartell's courses was future biochemist Albert Baird Hastings. Bartell served on several university administrative committees, co-organized conferences on colloid chemistry, and co-organized the American Chemical Society's Colloid Division in 1926. The ACS recognized him for his career achievements with the award of its Kendall Award in Colloid Chemistry in 1959. Bartell's research work had military applications and he was involved in war efforts throughout his career, serving as a captain in the Army's Nitrate Division starting during World War I and as a consultant to what was then the War Department starting in the 1920s. During World War II he was recognized for materials science advances in developing a water- and heat-resistant fabric treatment called \\"aerobond\\", for which he received funding from the Office of Scientific Research and Development in 1944 and which was proposed in 1946 for further development for peacetime applications. Bartell retired from his faculty position, assuming professor emeritus status, in 1953, though he continued to advise Ph.D. students after his official retirement. Personal life Bartell and his wife married in 1921 and had two children. Their daughter died young in 1946; their son Lawrence Bartell eventually became a noted professor of chemistry in his own right, serving on the faculty of Iowa State University and later as the Philip J. Elving Professor of Physical Chemistry at the University of Michigan. Floyd Bartell died on March 5, 1961.

He was suffect consul during the nundinium of September to October AD 83 with Lucius Calventius Sextius Carminius Vetus.Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70-96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), p. 160 Although some experts consider him a rival with Trajan as heir apparent to the emperor Nerva, he is primarily known from inscriptions. His polyonymous name has led to many interpretations. One, based on the form of his name used in consular dating (\\"M. Cornelius Nigrinus\\"), is that he was born Cornelius and adopted by a Curiatius Maternus (likely the orator of Tacitus' Dialogus de oratoribus), but Olli Salomies notes \\"the order of the names makes this altogether unlikely\\".Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 132 Ronald Syme suggested that \\"not perhaps a Cornelius adopting a Curiatius (still less the reverse, as some incautiously assumed), but rather the son of a Curatia. That is, a presumed sister of (C.?) Curiatius Maternus, orator, dramatist, and the central character in the Dialogus of Tacitus.\\"Syme, \\"The Paternity of Polyonymous Consuls\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 61 (1985), p. 193 Some authorities have suggested that this Curiatius is the same person as the orator in Tacitus' short work.T. D. Barnes, \\"Curiatius Maternus\\", Hermes, 109 (1981), pp. 382-384  Life  Maternus was born to the equestrian order; his hometown was Liria in Hispania, where an inscription honoring him was found. While still an eques, Maternus served as a military tribune of Legio XIV Gemina, which was stationed in Roman Britain at the time. He was adlected into the Roman Senate as an ex-praetor by Vespasian for his loyalty in the Year of Four Emperors.George W. Houston, \\"Vespasian's Adlection of Men in Senatum\\", American Journal of Philology, 98 (1977), p. 39 He served as governor of Gallia Aquitania from AD 80 until at least as late as 83; we have no record of another governor for this province until 94, when Senecio Memmius Afer is known to have held the position.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 304-306 He was later governor of Moesia from 85 until its division into Moesia Inferior and Moesia Superior; subsequently he was governor of Moesia Inferior until 89.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 310-315 He apparently was involved in Domitian's Dacian War, for during his governorship Maternus received a number of dona militaria, or military decorations, including two mural crowns and two camp crowns. A few years passed until Maternus was appointed to govern Syria in 95, which he held into the reign of Nerva.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 324-328  Maternus and Nerva  In a letter Pliny the Younger wrote to his friend Quadratus, while recounting an anecdote set during the short reign of the emperor Nerva, Pliny alludes to a man in charge of a massive army in the eastern part of the empire, about whom there was a lot of gossip, some causing apprehension.Pliny, Epistulae, IX.13.11 It is commonly presumed that this person was the governor of Syria; further, due to the date, this person is commonly assumed to be a rival to Trajan for the position of successor to Nerva.Andrew Berriman, Malcolm Todd and Malcom Todd, \\"A Very Roman Coup: The Hidden War of Imperial Succession, AD 96-8\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 50 (2001), pp. 317-323 It was thought that this unnamed person was Gaius Octavius Tidius Tossianus Lucius Javolenus Priscus, known to be governor of Syria in the 90s. However, Berriman, et al., believe it unlikely that Javolenus Priscus, \\"known as a jurist and member of Trajan's consilium rather than a military man, could have contemplated a challenge for the throne, much less that he would have remained in favour with Trajan thereafter\\".Berriman, et alia, \\"Very Roman Coup\\", p. 319 More recently G√©za Alf√∂ldy and Helmut Halfmann have presented Maternus as the individual Pliny likely alluded to in his letter to Quadratus.Alf√∂ldy and Halfmann, \\"M. Cornelius Nigrinus Curiatius Maternus, General Domitians und Rivale\\", Chiron, 3 (1973), pp. 331‚Äì373 An anomaly in the career of Aulus Larcius Priscus, suffect consul in 110, supports Maternus' identification. At the time, Priscus, who had been quaestor of Asia, then military tribune of Legio IV Scythica based in Syria, was appointed to the governorship of Syria. Syria was an important province, and its administration was usually assigned to a senior senator who had previously held the consulate. An appointment like this would only be made in an emergency, when something had happened to the previous governor. Any rival to Trajan, upon the latter's ascension to the throne, at the least would have been removed from an imperial position, and at most would have been executed. Whatever his fate, we have no record of Maternus after AD 97.

She served as the art editor of Demorest's Magazine. Secret Society Buildings New Haven,\\" from a drawing by Alice Donlevy (ca. 1880) Early years and education Born in Manchester, England, 7 January 1846, Donlevy came to the United States in her infancy, after the death of her mother. In 1854, her father, the inventor-engraver, John Intaglio Donlevy, married Harriet Farley. In 1856, Horace Greeley took Donlevy to the New York School of Design, a free art school for Women founded in 1852. Greeley convinced the school's director, Henry Herrick, to allow the 10-year-old girl to begin studying the arts of engraving. When the School was moved to the Cooper Union in 1858, Donlevy went with it. For seven years, she devoted her attention to designing wood-engravings for books and magazines, being one of the first workers in this art to introduce that original feature of American wood-engraving, the use of dots instead of lines for shades and shadows. Later, engraving was given up for designing for decoration. Since childhood, she drew with pen and ink for reproduction, her father, John Intaglio Donlevy, having invented certain valuable reproductive processes. She exhibited, while still very young, in the Academy of Design, and won prizes for general attainments. She received a second prize awarded by the Philadelphia Sketch Club for illumination. At the age of 14, she wrote for the press. Career In 1867, Donlevy published \\"Practical Hints on the Art of Illumination.\\" The manual, illustrated with Donlevy's original art work, encouraged artists working for industry as copyists to learn the arts of design. Thereafter, she wrote for the Art Review of Boston, the Art Amateur, the Art Interchange, St. Nicholas, Harper's Young People, The Ladies' World, Demorest's Magazine, and the Chautauquan. She served as the art editor of Demorest's Magazine. In 1867, she was one of the nine professional women artists who founded the Ladies' Art Association of New York. Among new professions for women established by the association was that of porcelain painting. In 1887, Donlevy was one of the committee of three to go to Albany, New York and lay before the New York State Legislature plans of free art industrial instruction for talented boys, girls and women, to be given during vacation seasons and on Saturday afternoons. The bill passed both houses. It was defeated later by eight votes when called up for reconsideration by Robert Ray Hamilton. Probably the best work of Donlevy was the aid that she personally gave to promote the interests of struggling associations and individual artists by means of free lectures and free lessons, and also by giving the latter introduction by means of public receptions at which their works were exhibited. Donlevy died in 1929. Her papers are held by the New York Public Library.

Her ideas reflected the principles of the feminist movement in the 60¬¥s. Women¬¥s development through education is the main topic of many of her pedagogical reflections. As an active socialist, she was a member of the PSE (Partido Socialista Ecuatoriano) as she believed it to be the national revindication movement, that represented principles to fulfill Ecuadorian needs. She and her husband invested their intellectual effort, as well as their own economic resources, to change the methodology that teachers used in Ecuadorian schools. Her work is considered a milestone in the struggle to reach quality education for women.  Life  Elisa Ortiz was born on September 12, 1902 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Her parents were √Ångel Jorge Ortiz Montufar and Victoria Guadalupe Garc√©s Salazar. She grew up in a changing time when Eloy Alfaro had begun a period of liberalism in Ecuador. When Elisa was eight, her family had to move to Ambato due to her mother‚Äôs illness. There, she studied in a private school where she was severely punished. Because of this traumatic event, she refused to attend an educational institution. She and her siblings were home-schooled. At the age of sixteen, she went back to Guayaquil to finish her education. She studied at ‚ÄúNormal Rita Lecumberri‚Äù, being one of the most brilliant students. She got a scholarship at ‚ÄúNormal Manuela Ca√±izares‚Äù High School. On July 25, 1921 she graduated and began to work as a Spanish teacher in the same High School at the age of nineteen. In 1924, she met Alfonso Aulestia Bravo, a coworker, and they got married. Sponsored by the German Mission, he got a scholarship to study in the ‚ÄúTecnische Universit√§t Berlin‚Äù in Berlin. Back from Germany, they both implemented new methodologies to improve technical education and try to contribute to the country‚Äôs development. She dedicated her life to her convictions of empowering women through education. On November 27, 1991, she died peacefully among her children at the age of 89.  Professional  = Educational field = * 1921: She joined the ‚ÄúNormal Manuela Ca√±izares‚Äù workforce.

She traveled to Peru to understand its educational system, because of which she was accused of economically impairing the State treasury; she permitted the registration of two pregnant girls for their senior year and she accepted the registration of an Afro-Ecuadorian student. * 1941: Elisa was invited by the Ann Arbor University of the State of Michigan, USA, to teach Spanish and to observe the institutional structure, the academic fundamentals and the organization of that University‚Äôs educational system. When she returned to Ecuador, she had been removed from her position and told that her educational services were no longer required. * 1946 to 1963: due to the rejection experienced in her own country, she exiled herself to Chile, country that welcomed her, valued her professional competence and she was hired her as a Teacher in the Pedagogical Section of the Ministry of Education. * 1963: she was called by the Ministry of Education of Ecuador to work as a technical advisor for the Holistic Education Planning Department. * 1964 to 1971: She was a technical advisor for the Holistic Education Planning Department Planning until 1971 when she retired. =Political field= * 1922: She joined the ‚ÄúPartido Socialista Ecuatoriano‚Äù * 1924: She presided the ‚ÄúCentro Feminista Luz de Pichincha‚Äù.

The unit recruited mainly from New South Wales, and had detachments in Murrumburrah, Gunnedah, Gundagai, Quirinidi, Mudgee, and various other NSW towns. The 1st Australian Horse wore distinctive myrtle green uniforms with black embroidery. Two detachments of the regiment served under General French's Cavalry Division during the Second Boer War in 1899, composed of 141 men and 157 horses. The first contingent left Newcastle on 14 November 1899 for Cape Town, South Africa, arriving on 13 December. The first detachment fought in the Battle of Slingersfontein on 16 January 1900 resulting in heavy casualties, and the first Australian casualty of the war. The unit then participated in the Battle of Poplar Grove and took part in occupying the towns of Driefontein and Bloemfontein. The regiment also took part in both the advance to Pretoria and the Battle of Zand River, as well as the subsequent Surrender of Pretoria on 1 June. They also saw action in the Battle of Belfast in 1901. The unit withdrew from South Africa by late March 1901.

Biography  Friedman, n√©e Shenberg, was born in Los Angeles to Nathaniel and Hortense Schenberg. After majoring in design at University of California, Los Angeles, she taught design at Los Angeles City College before moving with her husband to Minneapolis in 1958. She was hired by the Walker Art Center as a design consultant in 1969. Friedman was promoted to Curator of Design in 1979, after having conceived and organized several seminal exhibitions, such as the 1975 exhibition, Nelson/Eames/Girard/Propst: The Design Process at Herman Miller (Design Quarterly 98/99),http://www.worldcat.org/title/nelson-eames-girard-propst-the-design- process-at-herman-miller/oclc/6202594&referer;=brief_results bringing about further scrutiny and critical accolades for design as an art. She continued to work at Walker Art Center in many capacities up until her retirement in 1990. In addition to curating exhibits on architecture and design, including the Walker's noted 1986 exhibition Frank Gehry, architect, Friedman was also instrumental in shaping the remodeling and interiors of the Walker. Friedman was also interested in making architecture and design more accessible. \\"What interests me about movements in architecture and design is when something really has an impact on the way people live and the way they think.\\" In addition to her role as Curator of Design, Friedman also wrote extensively and served as an editor for several exhibition publications. Her first job at the Walker Art Center in 1969 was as the editor of Design Quarterly, a publication started by the Walker (1954-1996; previous title: Everyday Art Quarterly, 1946-1953). The last issue she edited was no. 152 (1991). In 2013, the Walker Art Center named their design fellowship, the Mildred S. Friedman Design Fellowship, a program started under Friedman's leadership in the 1980, in Friedman's honor.  Major exhibitions  Friedman curated or co-curated many large shows, from the 1970s up until the mid-2000s. In addition to Frank Gehry, architect, other notable shows include De Stijl, 1917-1931: Visions of Utopia and Tokyo: Form and Spirit. The last show she curated, Architecture Tomorrow, was a three year long series that ran from 1988-1991, ending after she retired.

He played alongside Edmond Cohanier in Georges Marion's Swiss band in 1925 and with Paul Gason's ensemble in Belgium. Through the end of the 1920s he played with a number of dance orchestras and with the ensembles of Lud Gluskin and Gregor. He later became conductor of the Jazz du Poste Parisien, and played with Michel Warlop and Wal-Berg in the mid-1930s. In 1934, he emigrated to the United States, where he worked again with Gluskin; the pair were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for their soundtrack to The Man in the Iron Mask.

She was built in 2018 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France, the fourth in Royal Caribbean's Oasis class of cruise ships. At , she is the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassing her sister ship , also owned by Royal Caribbean International. Description and design Symphony of the Seas measures in length and has a gross tonnage of 228,081 across 18 decks. She is able to accommodate 5,518 passengers at double occupancy up to a maximum capacity of 6,680 passengers, as well as a 2,200-person crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 22 restaurants, 4 pools and 2,759 cabins. For size perspective, Symphony of the Seas is about 30 metres (98 feet) longer than the largest military ships ever built, the U.S. Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. When compared to landmarks, Symphony of the Seas is as long as 3.5 football fields and twice as long as the height of the Washington Monument. Facilities include a children's water park, a full-size basketball court, ice-skating rink, a zip line that is 10 decks high, a Broadway-style theater with seating capacity of 1,401 passengers, an outdoor aquatic theater with Olympic-height platforms, and two rock-climbing walls. There is also a park containing over 20,000 tropical plants. The plants are maintained by an onboard team of one landscape specialist and three horticulturalists. One of the cocktail bars onboard includes electronic ordering via tablet and drink preparation by two robot bartenders that can prepare up to two drinks per minute. A significant part of the ship design was focused on the infrastructure, including safety, air conditioning, electric systems, water systems, and power generation. The ship includes a number of independent fire zones which can be cut off in the event of an emergency. Symphony of the Seas is powered onboard by six marine-diesel sets each composed of three 16-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 16V46D common rail engines and three 12-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 12V46D engines. The ship power system has a fuel consumption rate between 1,033 and 1,377 gallons of fuel per engine per hour. The energy efficient design of Symphony of the Seas enables it to accomplish shipboard power generation with 85 MW versus the 100 MW normally found on Oasis class ships. One of the key design features is the use of only LED or fluorescent lights in order to avoid the heat generation from incandescent bulbs, thereby reducing the load on air conditioning systems. The air conditioning systems are localized in order to minimize the inefficiencies of blowing cold air around the ship from a central location. Additional energy efficiency is accomplished by using a 2 MW steam turbine to recover waste heat from the engines and converting it into energy to power a portion of the onboard hotel load, such as laundry and other electrical loads. The ship's size and electrical load made it favorable to install the waste heat recovery system, which reduces the need for oil-fired boilers. For propulsion, Symphony of the Seas uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7380 horsepower. Among the Oasis class ships, Symphony of the Seas uses 25% less fuel due to the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water. The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship. Symphony of the Seas is designed to be a zero-landfill ship with all waste recycled, processed through water-purification systems, incinerated, or sent to a waste-to-energy facility. Construction and career On 29 October 2015 the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint- Nazaire, France. Symphony of the Seas floated out on 9 June 2017. Actors Alexa Vega, Carlos Pena Jr. and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \\"Godfamily\\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor. The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018. Night view of Symphony of the Seas at Saint-Nazaire From 15 to 18 February 2018 the cruise ship underwent sea trials and was formally turned over to Royal Caribbean International on 23 March. On 24 March the ship left Saint-Nazaire for M√°laga under the command of Rob Hempstead, arriving on 27 March, and arrived at the vessel's first homeport of Barcelona, Spain on 29 March. Symphony of the Seas in Naples, Italy On 31 March 2018 Symphony of the Seas offered her first passenger cruise and began her maiden voyage on 7 April for a week-long trip through the Mediterranean. During her first season Symphony of the Seas continued to sail on seven-night Western Mediterranean cruises from Barcelona. She repositioned on 28 October and arrived on 9 November at her new home port at the Royal Caribbean terminal at PortMiami in Florida, United States to provide cruises of the Caribbean. In January 2019, while Symphony of the Seas was docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a passenger jumped overboard and survived. The passenger and his friends were turned over to Nassau law enforcement. They were not charged, but were required to return home at their own expense. In August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials. During the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean has suspended all service across most of its fleet, including Symphony of the Seas, until 31 October 2020. A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April 2020. The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.
