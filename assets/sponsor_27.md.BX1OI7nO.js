This meteorite is important because it was the first fall of an iron meteorite viewed and reported by a significant number of witnesses, despite its low remaining total known weight. The Hraschina meteorite also proved that rocks really can \\"fall from the skies\\". History Drawing by M. W. Haidinger depicts the fall of the meteorite based on eyewitness accounts. On 26 May 1751, at 18:00, a fireball was seen over Hra≈°ƒáina and sounds like detonations were heard as far away as Vara≈ædin, giving an estimate of nearly of area over which the meteorite's sound was audible. Many people taking their Sunday evening walk witnessed the event. Baltazar Adam Krƒçeliƒá, a clergyman, historian, and a noted chronicler of daily events, who was spending time in the village of Bi≈°kupec, recorded the following: :\\"In Bi≈°kupec near Vara≈ædin an unusual phenomenon like a small cloud was seen ‚Äî although it was not a cloud ‚Äî which became paler and paler, produced an explosive sound and then dispersed. In their ignorance, the common folk thought that the heavens had opened.\\" Iron masses of and fell to the east of Hra≈°ƒáina and were later recovered. The larger mass penetrated into the ground. But there are reports that it went much deeper. The smaller mass was split at the place of the fall and partly used by the local villagers for making nails, while the rest of it was split further in Bratislava and subsequently lost. The Zagreb Catholic chapter sent the meteorites and an official report (the \\"Protocol of Bishop Klobuczezky and Curate-General Wolfgang Kukuljevic\\") to the Empress Maria Theresa. The meteorites were deposited in the Treasury in Vienna and then to the Court museum, now the Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Museum of Natural History in Vienna).T√∂r√∂k, J.

The north summit (Nordgipfel) is recorded as 3,286 metres high in the literature, but is 3,288 metres high according to the Federal Office for Metrology and Survey. The south summit (S√ºdgipfel), by contrast, is only 3,270 metres high. The two peaks are about 300 metres apart. They appear from the north as a stubby, cone-shaped, firn-covered dome, but from the east as a forbidding, dark rock face. Sharp, prominent ridges radiate from the peaks to the northeast and southwest, along the main crest of the mountain range. The twin peaks are the highest points in the summer skiing area of the Hintertux Glacier and, since the end of the 1990s, have been accessible from Hintertux on cable cars and ski lifts; which makes them a popular destination for day trippers. The north summit was first conquered in 1867 by Dr. Berreitter, the south summit on 7 September 1872 by the brothers, Max and Richard von Frey from Salzburg.  Surrounding area  The Gefrorenen- Wand-Spitzen are surrounded by glaciers. To the west the vast Gefrorene-Wand- Kees reaches up to the summits; to the southwest the Gro√üe Riepenkees reaches the 3,000 metre mark; to the northeast lies the little Friesenbergkees and, to the southeast is the Kleine Riepenkees. Their neighbouring peaks are: along the northeast ridge (Nordostgrat), separated by the Friesenbergscharte (2,904 m), the Riffler; along the southwest ridge (S√ºdwestgrat), separated by the broad Riepen Saddle (Riepensattel), lies the Olperer, at 3,476 metres, the highest peak on the Tux Crest. To the northwest the terrain falls away into the Tuxer Tal, and to the southwest into the Zamser Grund. An important settlement is Hintertux, some 6 kilometres away to the north as the crow flies. The Finkenberg village of Ginzling lies just under 11 kilometres to the east.

The spill itself however was not publicly disclosed until a month later. There were suspicions of official cover-ups by the State Oceanic Administration (SOA). Ownership The oil field is 51% owned by China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and 49% owned by the United States company ConocoPhillips. Spills 1st oil spill On June 4, 2011 the Penglai 19-3 oilfield caused an oil spill from a sea floor leak that lasted until June 7. 2nd oil spill On June 17 a second oil spill that occurred at the Penglai 19-3 oilfield, but was contained within 48 hours. By the second leak, it was reported that a total of 840 square kilometers of first grade clean water in Bohai Bay was polluted. 3rd oil spill A third leak took place on July 12 with the Suizhong 36-1 oil field. This occurred just one day after the Huizhou refinery explosion incident. In total the leaks contaminated a total of 4,250 square kilometers. The media has described the spill to be six times the size of Singapore. Leak disclosure The oil spill was not publicly reported until 31 days later on July 5, 2011. It was only revealed because of a public microblog tip-off that appeared on June 21. The news of the oil spill was withheld by the State Oceanic Administration (SOA) for a month. In a statement by the SOA, the US company ConocoPhillips managing the platform was held responsible for the leak, and was fined 200,000 yuan (US$31,000). CNOOC however, said they informed government authorities from the start. Environment impact Outside of the spill area, dead seaweed and rotting fish can be seen around Nanhuangcheng island (ÂçóÈöçÂüéÂ≥∂) in Shandong province. \\"The oil, containing toxic substances and heavy metals, will greatly affect the growth of marine lives that live on the seabed, such as clams, scallops and some kinds of crabs,\\" Xinhua reported last week quoting Cui Wenlin, director of the environmental monitoring centre with the North China Sea branch of the SOA. Bohai is a half-closed sea with comparatively low self-clean ability due to limited water exchange with the outside, he added. The environmental monitoring centre Cui directs has been monitoring the impacts of the oil spills on the Bohai's water quality, seabed sediments and marine lives. Though the US firm claims that no oil sheen reached the shoreline after the spills, Xinhua reports that \\"dead seaweed and rotting fish have been reported in the water around Nanhuangcheng Island, about 74 kilometres south from where the leaks originated\\". Responses Further criticism followed that if the spilled oil were to flow into the Yellow Sea, this will damage both North Korea and South Korea. Korean media have complained about Beijing being as irresponsible as the Japanese's reluctant to share information about its nuclear disasters. ConocoPhillips said the spill was the equivalent of 1,500 barrels of oil. But many Chinese environmental organisations questioned the credibility of the spill volume released by ConocoPhillips. Zhong Yu, senior action coordinator of Greenpeace, an international environmental organisation, told Xinhua that ‚Äúthe amount is questionable‚Äù because, apart from ConocoPhillips and the SOA, ‚Äòno third party attended the assessment‚Äô. In addition, 11 environmental organisations sent an open letter to ConocoPhillips China and CNOOC Ltd on Thursday, asking the two companies to assist the organisations and other people concerned to visit the scene of the leak to investigate the incident and its aftermath. Track records The CNOOC has recently come under scrutiny for several accidents involving its facilities, the third such incident on the Bohai Sea in less than two months. Following an oil spill on Tuesday in its Suizhong 36-1 oilfield, it was to be shut temporarily, SOA announced in a statement. By Wednesday afternoon, CNOOC finished cleaning up an oil slick near the oilfield and gradually resumed production.

It came after when he was appointed as the vice‚Äìcaptain in early‚ÄìJanuary 2014. He later captained RB Leipzig again for the second time this season, which came against SV Elversberg on 2 March 2014 and scored, as well as, assisting another goal, in a 2‚Äì0 win. Then, on 3 May 2014, Kaiser scored a hat‚Äìtrick, as well as, setting up two goals, in a 5‚Äì1 win over 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken, a win that help the club reach promotion to 2. Bundesliga after finishing the season in second place and became the first team since the introduction of the 3. Liga to win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga after only one season. Initially playing out as a defensive midfielder position, Kaiser then switched into playing as an attacking midfielder position. For his performance, Kaiser was named 3. Liga Player of the Year. In the 2014‚Äì15 season, Kaiser was featured for the first two league matches to the season before suffering a thigh injury. After returning to the first team from injury, he then scored his first goal of the season, as well as, setting up two goals, in a 3‚Äì1 win over Karlsruher SC on 24 September 2014. In the next match against Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, Kaiser captained the side for the first time this season, in a 2‚Äì2 draw. Following this, he continued to regain his first team place for the rest of the season. A month later against Erzgebirge Aue in the second‚Äìround of DFB‚ÄìPokal, he played a vital role during the match when he scored, as well as, setting up two goals, in a 3‚Äì1 win. Later in the 2014‚Äì15 season, Kaiser captained the side in number of matches in absent of Daniel Frahn. Despite missing two matches later in the 2014‚Äì15 season, Ahead of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Kaiser was given a captaincy following the departure of Daniel Frahn to 1. FC Heidenheim. He started out playing in the central‚Äìmidfielder at the start of the 2015‚Äì16 season following a tactics change. Kaiser then set up a goal for Davie Selke, who scored a header, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Eintracht Braunschweig on 15 August 2015. It wasn't until on 4 October 2015 when he scored his first goal of the season, in a 3‚Äì2 win over 1. FC N√ºrnberg. His performance resulted in him signing a three‚Äìyear contract, keeping him until 2018, later that month. His goal against FSV Frankfurt on 13 December 2015 earned him December's Goal of the Month. Under his leadership at RB Leipzig, Kaiser helped the club promoted to the Bundesliga after beating Karlsruher SC 2‚Äì0 on 8 May 2016. Despite missing four matches in the 2015‚Äì16 season, In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Kaiser remained captain for the side following a new management of Ralph Hasenh√ºttl. He then scored his first goal of the season, but was the only one who missed the penalty in the shoot‚Äìout, which saw Leipzig eliminated by Dynamo Dresden in the first round of DFB‚ÄìPokal. Kaiser played his first Bundesliga match since 2012 against his former club, TSG 1899 Hoffenheim and scored in a 2‚Äì2 draw in the opening game of the season. He was the first RB Leipzig to score in the Bundesliga. Kaiser started the season at the first team place, but soon lost his first team and was demoted to the substitute bench. Despite this, Kaiser remained involved in the first team for the side towards the end of the season. At the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season, Kaiser went on to make a total of 26 appearances and scoring 2 times in all competitions. Ahead of the 2017‚Äì18 season, Kaiser's captaincy status was in doubt after Manager Hasenh√ºttl made a decision to give a captain role to either Diego Demme and Willi Orban. Eventually, the role went to Orban. His first appearance of 2017‚Äì18 season came on 27 August 2017, coming on as a second‚Äìhalf substitute, in a 4‚Äì1 win over SC Freiburg. He also made his UEFA Champions League debut, where he played 16 minutes after coming on as a second‚Äìhalf substitute, in a 2‚Äì1 loss against Be≈üikta≈ü on 6 December 2017. However, he continued to struggle in the first team and playing time, due to strong competitions. Kaiser, himself, said he wanted to stay at the club until the end of the season.

Umayyah al-Damri against Abu Sufyan occurred in AH 4 of the Islamic Calendar See #no. 28. i.e. AD 625. According to Ar-Rahƒ´q al- Makhtum (the Sealed Nectar), a modern Islamic biography of Muhammad written by the Indian Muslim author Safi-ur Rahman Mubarakpuri, biographers have said that Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri was sent on an errand to kill Abu Sufyan (the leader of the Quraysh), who had also sent a Bedouin to kill Muhammad. The Mission was unsuccessful, but Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri killed three polytheists along the way.. The Mission Reason for mission Muhammad ordered the Mission of Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri to assassinate Abu SufyanMubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 211. to avenge Khubyab bin Adi. According to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri, the Quraysh ordered Khubyab bin Adi to be crucified by Uqba bin al-Harith because he had killed Uqba bin al-Harith's father.Mubarakpuri, The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet, pp. 350-351. Events during the mission Per Al-Tabari, Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri set out and first visited the Ka'bah where he was spotted by one of the Meccans. The Muslim assassins then fled and hid in a cave. While the Muslims were still in the cave Uthman bin Malik al-Taymi came close riding his horse while they were hiding. Then Amr bin Umayyah al-Damri came out of hiding and killed him, he \\"stabbed him below the breast\\" with a dagger and al- Taymi gave out a loud scream which other Meccans heard. The Muslims remained in the cave until the pursuers left. They then went to al-Tanim and found the spot where Khubyab bin Adi was crucified on a cross. Al-Damri untied Khubayb from the cross, and traveled \\"forty paces\\" before he was spotted. He dropped Khubayb's body and again hid in a cave. While he was in the cave a Bedouin shepherd from the Banu Bakr tribe passed by, he had one eye as he had lost an eye .He asked \\"Who is there?\\", al-Damri replied: \\"One of the Banu Bakr.\\". The Bedouin lay down next to al-Damri and began to sing \\"‚ô¨ I will not be a Muslim as long as I live ‚ô¨\\" and al-Damri replied \\"You will soon see!\\". The Bedouin then went to sleep and al-Damri states: > I went to him and killed him in the most dreadful way that anybody has ever > killed anybody. I leant over him, stuck the end of my bow into his good eye, > and thrust it down until it came out of the back of his neck. After that I > rushed out like a wild beast [Tabari, Volume 7, p. 148] Al-Damri then fled and came to a place called al-Naqi. At this place there were two Meccans sent as spies by the Quraysh to check on Muhammad. Al-Damri \\"shot an arrow at one of them and killed him\\", and he then called on the other spy to surrender. After he surrendered, he tied him up, brought him to Muhammad and told him what happened after being questioned about it. Muhammad looked at him and laughed. > \\"Well done!\\" he said, and prayed for me to be blessed.

From 1924, Seligman headed the Paris and New York offices of Jacques Seligmann & Cie., a prominent art dealership. Originally named Germain Seligmann with two Ns, he dropped one of them in 1943 when he obtained United States citizenship.\\"Jacques Seligmann & Co. records, 1904-1978, bulk 1913-1974\\", Archives of American Art. Retrieved 15 July 2011. Biography Beginnings The son of Jacques Seligmann, a German-born French and American antiquarian and art dealer, Seligman was raised in Paris in the luxurious H√¥tel de Monaco. He showed an early interest in art and often visited the company's galleries together with his father who introduced him to the art trade. He frequently joined his father on business trips including a one to St. Petersburg in 1910 in connection with the acquisition of the Swenigorodskoi enamels. Seligman joined the French army immediately after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 where he served first in the 132nd Infantry Regiment of Reims and, from 1916, in the 24th Infantry Brigade where he was promoted to captain. In 1917, he acted as liaison officer to the First Division of the American Expeditionary Forces where he served as translator for George C. Marshall. Moving company priorities to modern art In 1920, after being discharged at the end of the war, Seligman became a partner in his father's company. As a result, the name was changed to Jacques Seligmann et Fils. He became president of the New York office where he concentrated fully on art rather than the antiquarian market in which his father had first been interested. In 1923, on the death of his father, he became president of both the Paris and New York interests, changing the name back to Jacques Seligmann & Cie.\\"German Seligman\\", Encyclop√©die Universalis. Retrieved 17 July 2011. Seligman developed a strong interest in modern art for the New York gallery, dealing in works by Pierre Bonnard, Paul C√©zanne, Honor√© Daumier, Edgar Degas, Henri Rousseau, and Vincent van Gogh but in the face of resistance from other members of the family turned to C√©sar Mange de Hauke who had studied art in England and France and arrived in the United States in 1926. For a short period de Hauke worked as a sales representative for Seligman but the two soon decided to set up a subsidiary, de Hauke & Co., Inc., to deal in modern art. Established in 1926, the company purchased art in Paris and London for sales in the United States. Works by Amedeo Modigliani, Odilon Redon, Ker-Xavier Roussel and √âdouard Vuillard were exhibited and sold in New York. Soon coverage was extended to Paul C√©zanne, Jacques-Louis David, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Jean Ingres, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Georges Seurat. Pablo Picasso was featured twice, first in 1936 with paintings from the Blue Period and the Rose Period, and second in the November 1937 exhibition Twenty Years in the Evolution of Picasso showcasing the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon which Seligman had acquired from the Jacques Doucet estate. The Museum of Modern Art acquired the painting for $24,000 raising $18,000 toward the purchase price by selling a Degas painting and obtaining the remainder from donations by the co-owners of the gallery Germain Seligman and Cesar de Hauke.Fluegel, Jane. \\"Chronology\\". In: Pablo Picasso, Museum of Modern Art (exhibition catalog), p.309, 1980. William Rubin (ed.). As a result of the successful new business strategy, the other family members withdrew their opposition and Jacques Seligmann & Co., Inc. adopted Seligman's evolving preferences. De Hauke's company was dissolved and de Hauke returned to Paris. Seligman was a member of committee coordinating art for the New York World Fair in 1939. Nazi looting In the late 1930s, the Paris office came under increasing pressure as a result of political developments. Many of the assets were taken over by the Vichy government and sold at public auction. The archives were burnt by company staff to prevent confiscation by the Nazis. Seligman moved the company headquarters to New York. After the war, Seligman's efforts were concentrated on recovering artworks looted by the Nazis. There was a general family reconciliation with all working towards the interests of the company. In 1951, the Duc d'Arenberg commissioned the company to sell an important collection of illuminated manuscripts and other artworks.  Marriage  On June 6, 1946, Seligman married Ethylene Jackson (1907-1993) of Kansas City, Missouri. Jackson, a college graduate with a degree in art history, had thirteen years‚Äô experience at the Nelson Gallery in Kansas City: not only had she served as executive secretary to the gallery‚Äôs first director, Paul Gardner, she had been curator of the gallery's decorative arts collection as well as their American period rooms. In November 1942 Jackson became acting director of the gallery when Paul Gardner was commissioned as a major in the US Army, to become one of the famed Monuments Men in North Africa and Europe. Jackson was acting director for three years and a month, until Gardner's return in December 1945. After the wedding, she moved to New York City to live with her new husband. Closure of the company On Seligman's death in 1978, the company closed. There was recognition of the leading part he and his father had played in developing interest in art in the United States. Those who benefitted from the company's activities included a number of art collectors as well as art museums and institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art. Seligman's written works Seligman began writing in the 1940s, publishing a monograph on Roger de La Fresnaye in 1945 and one on The Drawings of Georges Seurat in 1947. His \\"Oh!

The participation of the best players in Mexico could serve as encouragement for those players at lower levels of the sport in Mexico and eventually play on the Mexico national team at international competitions against high quality foreign teams. The first League season (2010‚Äì2011) started with 4 teams: Mayan Astronomers, Aztec Eagle Warriors, Teotihucan Priests and Zapotec Totems, which were integrated through a draft, where players are ranked in categories \\"AAA\\" \\"AA\\", \\"A\\" and then, each team chose their players in succession, so that 4 sets have the same competitive level. Fifteen days before the \\"play off\\" teams have a period of transfer or exchange of players, where teams will have the opportunity to improve their competitive edge. They play a four round system (\\"round robin\\") and their final. The team with the most points will automatically qualify for the final. Those who remain in second and third place play a best-of-three series. The winner will play the number-one team during the finals. The champion is declared when a best-of-three series is played between these two last teams. For the second season, the Mexican Sports Federation Ice Hockey, AC seek to integrate the Mexican League Elite, a fifth team will consist of novice players. This new team will have the right to select some players from the four other teams prior to start; but the existing four teams can identify a list of \\"protected players\\" that the new expansion team cannot select. Each year will include a Mexican Elite League expansion team until there are 8 teams. Mexican Sports Federation Ice Hockey, AC, awarded cash prizes for winning team in the near future, aims to set salaries for players of all teams, as well as explore the possibility of bringing foreign players to integrate the different Mexican League Elite teams.

The peak is firn-covered on its northern side, but from the south it looks like a rocky summit. Ridges run from the top towards the southwest, north, northeast and southeast, some of them carrying approach paths. The summit is easily attained from the mountain hut of Spannagelhaus to the west or the Friesenberghaus to the south and, as a result, is often visited. In winter it is an easy destination for ski mountaineers. The peak was first ascended during the Austrian national survey. The first tourist climber, according to the literature, was one H. Weber, guided by Georg Samer in 1875.  Surrounding area  The summit block of the Hoher Riffler from the west; in front the Schwarzbrunnerkees glacier The Zillertal Riffler (Zillertaler Riffler) is only enclosed by glaciers to the north and west. To the north the Federbettkees starts just below the summit whilst, to the west, is the much smaller Schwarzbrunnerkees. To the southeast are the remnants of the Rifflerkees, which has largely retreated due to global warming. Amongst the neighbouring peaks are the twin summits of the Gefrorene-Wand-Spitzen (3,288 m) along the southwest ridge (S√ºdwestgrat) on the other side of the 2,904 m high wind gap of the Friesenbergscharte. On the other side of the Federbettkees, along the north ridge (Nordgrat) which swings northeast, lie the Griererkarspitze (2,968 m), Napfspitze (2,925 m) and die 3,038 metre high Realspitze, separated by the col of Obere Rifflerscharte (2,968 m), Along the southeast ridge (S√ºdostgrat), above the Wesendlekarsees glacier (surface at 2,375 m) and separated by the 2,774 m high col of Untere Rifflerscharte, is the Kleine Riffler (2,835 m). The nearest important settlement is the winter sports resort of Hintertux about four kilometres northwest as the crow flies.  Bases and routes  The Friesenberghaus (2,498 m) is the base for an ice-free climb along the south ridge (S√ºdgrat). The base for an approach via the Friesenbergscharte gap and southwest ridge (S√ºdwestgrat) is the Spannagelhaus. Both routes are similar and of climbing grade UIAA I and count as the normal route. According to the literature, it takes about 2 1/2 hours to reach the summit cross from the Friesenberghaus and somewhat less time from the Spannagelhaus. In winter the climb can be done as an easy ski tour.

Aidi has competed at four consecutive Summer Paralympics, winning silver medals at three of the Games. She is also a three time World Championships winner medalist and has held the F54 javelin world record on numerous occasions throughout her career. Personal history Aidi was born in Sfax, Tunisia in 1977. She was born able bodied, but suffered permanent spinal injuries after a medical error. Athletics career Aidi took up athletics at the age of 26, after she became disabled. Her international debut was at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, Greece where she represented her country in all three throwing events available to her classification; the F54‚Äì55 discus throw, javelin throw and shot put. She failed to progress into the final eight for the shot put and discus, but her distance of 12.22 metres in the javelin saw her acquire enough points to finish just outside the podium positions in fourth. Two years after Athens, Aidi competed at her first IPC Athletics World Championships. Held in Assen, the 2006 Championships allowed Aidi a chance to compete against the best athletes in the world outside the Paralympics. She competed in two events, the shot put (T54) and the javelin throw (F54-56). She finished fourth in both. Her first international medals were won at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. In the shot put she threw 6.81 to finish fourth, but success followed in the javelin where her third round throw of 16.83 not only gave her the silver medal but also set a new world record in the F54 category. Further international success followed three years later in the buildup to the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London when Aidi travelled to Christchurch in New Zealand to compete at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships. There she again focused on the shot put and the javelin, finishing fifth in the shot, but a world record throw of 17.27 in the javelin gave her the gold medal. The following year, at the London Paralympics, Aidi attempted to recreate her form from he World Championships. In the women's javelin throw (T54/55/56) despite exceeding her world record from Christchurch twice with distances of 17.28 and 17.40, she was unable to compete against China's Yang Liwan, who led from the first throw. Aidi still left with the silver medal in the javelin, and added a fifth place in the shot put. The next year Aidi retook the world record in the javelin, throwing 18.32 metres at the 2013 World Championships in Lyon, pushing her Paralympic rival Yang, into silver medal place. As well as retaining her javelin world title she also took bronze in the shot put. Two years later, in Doha, she extended her world record in the javelin further, recording a distance of 18.86 metres on the way to winning her third consecutive world championships title. Hopes were high for Aidi at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro and she was chosen by her country to be the flag bearer at the opening ceremony.

They were to be built in Poland, the first destroyers so constructed, and were to be named Huragan (\\"hurricane\\") and Orkan (\\"windstorm\\"), respectively. Their design included greater power and displacement than the first two ships of the class. Their construction was interrupted by the beginning of World War II and they were never completed. History In the late 1930s, the Polish Navy decided to expand its destroyer fleet. With positive reviews of the operational service of the two British- built , Grom and B≈Çyskawica, the Navy decided to order two more ships of that type. This time, however, the order was given (on 1 May 1939) to the recently expanded Polish Naval Yard (Stocznia Marynarki Wojennej) in Gdynia rather than to the British J. Samuel White shipyard in Cowes, responsible for the two previous ships. They would have been the first destroyer-class warships to be built in Poland (till then, the Polish shipyards have been building smaller ships, such as minelayers and minesweepers). The White shipyards were to provide the turbines, and some armament was also ordered abroad (main and secondary guns from Swedish Bofors, and machine guns from the French company Hotchkiss et Cie). The cost of the destroyers was 32 million zlotys, of which 55% was to be spent in Poland. The two new destroyers were planned with several changes in the design. The superstructure and funnels were to be grouped together, and crew quarters layout was changed. Welding was to be used more prominently in the construction. Engine power was to be increased by 2,500 horsepower; the displacement would be increased by 70 tons. Huragan was to be ready for April 1942 (36 months after being ordered), and Orkan, for October of that year. Construction work on Huragan begun on 15 July 1939, when its keel was laid down. The German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 interrupted the construction; some materials were diverted to the improvised armoured train \\"Kashubian Dragon\\".Tadeusz Krawczak, Jerzy Odziemkowski: Polskie pociƒÖgi pancerne w wojnie 1939.

The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil poet saints known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is counted as the earliest of all Chola temples. Shiva in the guise of Nagaraja, the serpent king.. There are many inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from Cholas, Thanjavur Nayaks and Thanjavur Maratha kingdom. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering gopuram gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century. The temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses three gateway towers known as gopurams. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Nageswarar, Pralayamkathanathar and Periyanayagi being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the Vijayanagar period that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend During the time when Adisesha was feeling under the weight of the earth, he did penance at Kuvivanam. Parvathy appeared and blessed him at this place to get strength. The water body in the temple is called Naga Theertham. Th temple known is for its shrine of Rahu, one of the nine celestial bodies in the Navagrahas. A legend has it that the mythological serpents Dakshan and Kaarkotakan worshipped Lord Shiva here. Legend also has it that King Nala worshipped Shiva here as in Thirunallar. There is a Naganathar temple at Tirunageswaram having similar features like temple. This place has been referred in Tevaram written by Saint Tamil poet of 7th Century AD, Thirugnana Sambanthar. History Aditya Chola constructed this temple during the 9th century. It is great marvel of Chola architecture, building technology and astronomy. The orientation is structured in such a way that it allows sunlight inside the temple, right on the sanctum only during the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May). It bears another name called Surya Kottam or Keezha Kottam. The Karuvarai (Sanctum Sanctorum) of Nageswaran temple is similar to Sarangapani Temple, as it is made in the form of a Chariot. The temple consists of three gopurams in the eastern, western and southern directions. The temple is designed in such a way that during the first three days of Tamil month Chittirai (April - May), the rays of the Sun falls directly in the base of the presiding deity in sanctum sanctorum.R. 2001, pp. 217-8 The temple had been a centre of learning as seen from the inscriptions in the temple. The inscriptions indicate specific subjects like Purvamimansa styled as Pravahakarma. There were also provisions made for feeding and maintaining for teachers and students. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture The temple is one of the prominent Shiva temples in Kumbakonam. The temple shows early Chola art in its best form particularly in the form of human figures. The sanctum is of padabandha-padmaka type stands on padmopana. The lotus leaves of the padmopano are carved with vitality. In its iconographic scheme the Ardhanari, Brahma and Dakshinamoorthy in the niches of the outer wall are featured. The other sculptures on the walls almost life-size reflect either the donors to the temples or contemporary princesses and princes. The epic scenes are in low relief on the plinth below the pilasters of the walls of the sanctum, recalling the wood work. The Devi shrine is an independent structure situated in the outer prakaram(outer precincts of a temple), detached from the axial unit, though it faces south, a feature common to Saiva Devin shrines. The complex of Nataraja shrine is in the form of a chariot on wheel drawn by horses as in the case of Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram and Sarangapani Temple in Kumbakonam.Temples of South India P.112. V.V. Subba Reddy Similar architecture of halls (Mandapas) simulating a chariot drawn by elephant or horses is found in Sarangapani temple at Kumbakonam, Mela Kadambur Amirthakadeswarar Temple, Sikharagiriswara Temple, Kudumiyamalai, Vriddhagiriswarar Temple, Vriddhachalam and Thyagaraja Temple, Tiruvarur. According to historian Harle, the temple is counted among the four early extant temples of the Chola Empire, with the other three being Koranganatha Temple in Tiruchirappalli district, Moovar Koil in Pudukottai district, and Brahmapureeswarar temple in Thanjavur district. These temples follow the Pallava architecture which are relatively small in size. They all have a fair- sized porch, locally called ardhamandapa attached to the sanctum, both of which are slightly below the ground level in a pit kind of structure. The structures are also predominantly built of stone. During Rajendra Chola's Ganges expedition, the victorious chola army brought a beautiful Vinayagar statue as a war trophy to the chola empire. The Vinayagar statue was kept at this temple and was aptly named as Gangai Vinayagar. Currently, the Vinayagar is present in the ardha mandapam, in front of the sanctum of Nageswarar. The Vinayagar seems to be in the Pala style. Festivals and religious importance Nageswaran chariot The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaiva community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed five times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Ardha Jamam at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Nageswarar and Periyanayagi. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshipers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ' (Monday) and ' (Friday), fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, pournami (full moon day) and sathurthi. Mahashivaratri during February - March is the major festivals celebrated in the temple. The major festival of the temple is the Brahmotsavam temple during Tamil month of Panguni when the Sun's rays fall directly on the image in the sanctum. Religious importance Tirugnana Sambandar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Nageswarar in ten padigams in Tevaram, compiled as the First Tirumurai and second Tirumuari. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Nageswarar in 12 padigams in Tevaram, compiled in the Fourth, fifth and sixth Tirumurai. Sundarar, the 8th century Nayanmar revered Nageswarar in seven padigams, which is compiled in Seventh Tirumuari. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. The temple is counted as the 52nd in the list of temples in the northern banks of Cauvery. Twelve Shiva temples are connected with Mahamaham festival which happens once in 12 years in Kumbakonam. They are Kasi Viswanathar Temple, Kumbeswarar Temple, Someswarar Temple, Nageswaran temple, Kalahasteeswarar Temple, Gowthameswarar Temple, Kottaiyur Kodeeswarar temple, Amirthakalasanathar Temple, Banapuriswarar Temple, Abimukeswarar Temple, Kumbakonam, Kambatta Visvanathar Temple and Ekambareswarar Temple.Mahamaham Festival 2004 (in Tamil), Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, 2004 As per a Hindu belief, people troubled by Sarpa-dosha or Malefic effects Rahu-Kethu seek a relief by offering prayers in a single day to Kudanthai or Kumbakonam Nageshwarar in the morning, Thirunageshwaram Naganathar at the noon, Thirupamburam Pambureswarar in the evening and Nagoor Nageshwarar or Naganathar temple at night.

Its first flight was in March 2011. Design and development The Dyn'A√©ro Twin-R is a twin engine development of the four-seat, single-engine Dyn'A√©ro MCR4S, with a 580 mm (1 ft 11 in) greater span and increases in tail surface areas. It was originally intended that it should be built from drawings but changes to French multi-engine aircraft regulations led to plans for kit production. The Twin-R follows previous MCR series structural practice with much use of carbon fibre, notably in the spars and ribs of the wings and control surfaces, which have pre-formed aluminium skins. The fuselage is a carbon fibre monocoque. The wings have constant chord as on the MCR4S, though the increased span raises the aspect ratio to 10.8, and the Twin-R uses the winglets of the early MCR4S versions (2001-2), with curved (in plan) trailing edges, rather than the later, straight edged ones. The aileron span is increased by 20% and the flaps are electrically operated. Like the MCR4S, the Twin-R has a swept fin, ventral fin and T-tail but the fin is taller and the all flying tailplane of greater span. The rudder area is almost doubled and the surface is double hinged to control yaw when one engine is shut down. The cabin and rear fuselage of the Twin-R are similar to that of the MCR4S. The cabin has a large, forward hinged, one piece canopy with trapezoidal windows aft. It seats the pilot and three passengers in two side-by-side rows. The twin 74 kW (99 hp) Rotax 912ULS flat four engines are wing mounted. The tricycle undercarriage has wing mounted, faired main legs and wheels. The Twin-R appeared in public for the first time at the AERO Friedrichshafen 2010 show. It flew for the first time on 3 March 2011 piloted by Christian Briand.

Working with government-led subsidies, HomeSun now offers free cavity wall insulation. The company's particular focus within the category is residential blocks of flats of three storeys and above. The Business Model In 2010, HomeSun brought Free Solar PV to the UK, took 350,000 applications. To enable Free Solar, HomeSun used the Government-led ‚ÄòFeed-in Tariffs‚Äô and inverted the traditional business model. Instead of homeowners having to find the money to buy solar panels, HomeSun paid for the panels as well as 25 years of maintenance. In return, HomeSun received the Feed-In Tariff and the homeowner received free electricity. The company delivers the free proposition with boilers and now, Cavity Wall Insulation for blocks of 3 storeys and over. Background After the introduction of FIT scheme passed through parliament by the Labour government on 1 April 2010, HomeSun planned to install 100,000 panels worth ¬£1 billion over three years as part of their ‚Äòfree solar‚Äô scheme.Energy Firm's ¬£1bn Solar Power Giveaway 5 August 2010 Sky NewsHomeSun offers free solar panels to UK homes 6 August 2010 Energy Efficiency News The new Conservative government‚Äôs introduction of financial caps on this scheme led to fears that the solar industry would suffer, however Daniel Green, CEO of HomeSun, maintained that the benefits of solar energy would still be felt by ordinary households.Government reductions to feed-in tariff rates for solar PV are a bad choice 11 July 2011 Architects Data FileSolar panels on schools on hospitals in jeopardy 19 March 2011 The Daily Telegraph The HomeSun free solar panel installation scheme was highly commended by the Microgeneration UK Awards in 2011, (while the company‚Äôs partner Carillion Energy Services won the Commercial Innovation award for Project Bright, a privately financed end-to- end delivery model for installing solar PV).Microgeneration UK Awards 2011 30 June 2011 Heating and Ventilation News Now, HomeSun have received funding for free cavity insulation which comes from the utilities as part of their government-led ECO programme. HomeSun has been selected to install ECO measures and the funding they receive covers everything from surveys, access equipment, market-leading insulation products, and the guarantee. However, just like the solar subsidies, this government-led funding is due to be cut March 2014. The Company HomeSun is based in New Oxford Street, London. The company was founded upon ‚Äògreen principles‚Äô to take action against climate change. The company was co-founded by Daniel Green and Bill Sneyd. Sue Welland (a founding partner of HomeSun) was founder of The CarbonNeutral Company.Me And My Partner: Dan Morrell And Sue Welland 17 November 1999, The Independent The company is accredited to renewable energy trade bodies including Act On CO2, The Energy Saving Trust, Renewable Energy Association, Solar Trade Association and the Micropower Council. Media HomeSun has featured on BBC TV and many UK news and media outlets. In 2010, BBC Breakfast featured an investigation into how HomeSun could help UK consumers save money on their electricity bills. The company has also featured in articles on home solar energy by the Financial Times,Enlightened energy 28 January 2011, The Financial Times The Sunday Times,With energy prices rises, the heat is on 12 June 2011 The Sunday Times and The Guardian.Free solar panels sound good, but buying them yourself is better Saturday 14 August 2010 The Guardian More recently, HomeSun has featured in The Guardian as a solution to cheap ways of improving wall insulations.‚ÄúWhat is the cheapest way to improve wall insulation?‚Äù Selling your home HomeSun leases comply to the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) guidelines, and they offer Deeds of Variation to keep up with the latest amendments. However, in reality most lenders in the UK have additional requirements over and above the CML guidelines. HomeSun have a policy of refusing to consider further changes to the lease agreement, drastically reducing the number of lenders that potential buyers can use. This goes against their sales patter which claims that \\"Over 7,000 free installations have been completed by HomeSun and in each case, lenders accepted the HomeSun lease.http://www.homesun.com/selling-a-house-with-solar- panels/\\" HomeSun do not provide a way of terminating the lease during its term, other than by paying the \\"buy-out\\" charge.

To the northeast just below the summit lies the Tuxer Joch-Haus.  History  In early times there was a busy bridle path over the Tuxer Joch from the Brenner route into the Zillertal valley. As early as prehistoric times the saddle was known to humans. Finds of tools made of hornstein and south Alpine flints indicate that the Tuxer Joch was crossed by Stone Age peoples. A decorative pin from the Bronze Age was found at the pass. Farmers drove their cattle over the saddle, and farmers and traders also crossed the pass bearing local products. Occasionally funeral processions also passed this way, because the village of Tux once belonged to the parish of Schmirn on the other side of the saddle, so the dead had to be carried there. Later this parochial structure was changed, but the secular administrative arrangement was not altered until 1926. But the Tuxer Tal had long been oriented towards the Zillertal and when it was subsequently linked by a road in the 19th century, the Tuxer Joch lost its importance for local traffic and has since acted merely as a transit path for walkers. In 1940/41 a plan emerged to build a tourist road over the Tuxer Joch, and a full-blown project was developed. This project was not just set up for tourist purposes, because a side road to the Brenner Pass was of considerable military-strategic importance to the Wehrmacht.

Initially founded to construct locomotives, the company produced the first iron bridge in France, and moved away from mechanical to civil engineering projects in France, North Africa, Europe, and in East Asia and South America. In 1968 the company merged with the electrical engineering company SPIE to form Spie Batignolles. After being briefly owned by the AMEC group (2003) the civil engineering construction activities were split and sold. As of 2011, Spie Batignolles SA is the effective successor of the company. History Ernest Go√ºin et Cie. On 18 February 1847, Ernest Go√ºin, having gained experience in England on the manufacture of locomotives and machine tools whilst acting on behalf of the Chemin de fer de Paris √† Orl√©ans, founded the company Ernest Gouin et Cie. With the financial backing of several bankers, including James de Rothschild, the company was launched with total capital of 750,000 Francs. One of the primary reasons for the company's creation was to manufacturer locomotives for the newly formed Chemin de Fer du Nord (1845); initially the company focused on locomotive manufacture.Rang-Ri Park (2000), pp.364‚Äì371\\"Soci√©t√© de construction des Batignolles\\", Archives nationalesRang-ri Park-Barjot, (2004 conference paper), \\"1.1 The Soci√©t√© Ernest Go√ºin et Cie : from locomotive making to general contractor\\" The company introduced the first Crampton locomotive into France, and gained orders from the not only the Chemin de Fer du Nord, but also the Paris Orl√©ans and the Paris Lyon railways. A financial crisis (as well as the 1848 revolution) caused recession, and a drop in locomotive orders, spurring the company to diversify. One new product was production of spinning machines. Another was iron bridge manufacture, and in 1852 the company constructed France's first iron bridge. The structure, built of the Seine at Asni√®res had a total length of . Despite erratic orders the company expanded rapidly; by 1856 a second share issue doubled the capital of the company, the same year the company's revenue was 7 million francs. In 1855 the company's factory was enlarged to accommodate the construction of iron bridges. Further orders for iron bridges came from France, and abroad, giving the company work for several years, and steady growth. To compensate for the uncertainties in the locomotive building business, the company began production of steam engines, as well as shipbuilding ‚Äì acquiring a large shipyard in Nantes, and became a supplier to the French Navy. Experience with the building of iron bridges led to it undertaking related work, including the construction of foundations, and masonry. In 1862 the company entered the railway line construction field. It worked with the Compa√±√≠a de los Caminos de Hierro del Norte de Espa√±a constructing a section of a line across the Pyrenees which included many earthworks and tunnels. Railway works were also undertaken in Italy (on the Naples-Foggia line), and in Russia and Poland; including a bridge over the Vistula. On 1 January 1872 the company was converted to a joint stock company, the Soci√©t√© de Construction des Batignolles.Rang-ri Park-Barjot, (2004 conference paper), 1.2 The Soci√©t√© de Construction des Batignolles : an activity increasingly turned to public works Soci√©t√© de Construction des Batignolles Conversion to a public company, the Soci√©t√© de Construction des Batignolles (SCB), in 1872 allowed the company to raise capital. By 1880 over 5 million francs of shares had been issued. The new company was to continue the work of Ernest Gouin et Cie.; shipbuilding, bridges and other civil engineering works, and machine and locomotive building. Ernest Go√ºin died in 1885, to be succeeded by his son Jules as chairman of the company. With most mainline railways in Europe complete by the 1870s, the group's search for contracts became increasingly international. By the 1880s civil engineering was becoming the core business.Rang-ri Park- Barjot, (2004 conference paper), 2 The Rise of a global group strategy The company undertook some large railway construction projects such as the construction of the line from B√¥ne to Guelma in Algeria for the Compagnie des chemins de fer B√¥ne-Guelma, and the line from Dakar to Saint-Louis, Senegal. These were operated as concessions by subsidiaries of the SCB. By 1913 the company had fourteen subsidiary companies located throughout the world running railways. The company also constructed canals for irrigation, ports and harbours, and water and sewerage systems. Profits from concessions in north Africa, in particular Tunisia, were high (over 25% in the 1890s), and allowed expansion without share issues or loans. The First World War caused a halt to international civil engineering contracts, except for a line in Greece of significance to military supply. The plant in the Avenue de Clichy produced armoured cars, gun carriages, bombs, trench mortars and other war material. The peace brought opportunities for rebuilding; including a potential demand for new locomotives.Jean Monville et al, \\"Une Histoire de SPIE, Na√Ætre et rena√Ætre\\", La SCB et le Premier Conflit Mondial p.48 (p.57 html version) In 1917 a locomotive construction company, the Compagnie g√©n√©rale de construction de locomotives (Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon) in Nantes was formed by the SCB and the Soci√©t√© des forges de Ch√¢tillon-Commentry-Neuves-Maisons. In 1928 SCB closed its factory on the Avenue de Clichy in Paris, transferring locomotive and other manufacturing to the Nantes subsidiary. The Trinity Bridge (Saint Petersburg) was built between 1897 and 1903 After the divestment of metal manufacturing to 'Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon' most of the company's sales were overseas; one-third came from French colonies, and two-thirds from other countries, much from eastern Europe.Jean Monville et al, \\"Une Histoire de SPIE, Na√Ætre et rena√Ætre\\", La Chantiers G√©ants de Construction p.49 (p.58 html version) In the interwar years the company undertook several major projects including the construction of the Port of Gdynia, and ports in Madagascar and Djibouti, the Congo-Ocean Railway (Chemin de fer Congo-Oc√©an), and began work on a dam near Sansanding on the Niger. The construction of the Chemin de fer Congo-Oc√©an caused a scandal as it used essentially forced labour, with a very heavy cost in life‚Äîup to 20% of the workforce in some parts.Jean Monville et al, \\"Une Histoire de SPIE, Na√Ætre et rena√Ætre\\", p.50-54 (p.59-63 html version) In the years preceding the Second World War, after the 7 July 1938 law relating to industrial mobilisation in war, the SCB obtained several contracts from the French state, such as fortification constructions and armament factory constructions. The subsidiary 'Batignolles-Ch√¢tillon' also received numerous orders and expanded its factory, not only for locomotive production but also for the ministries of war. After the beginning of the war and during the German military occupation many overseas projects were halted, and work in France was much reduced. Under pressure from the Nazis, Ernest Go√ºin (CEO) agreed to help with the construction of the Atlantic Wall, for which he was imprisoned after the Liberation of France. He was released and returned to the position of CEO in October 1946.Jean Monville et al, \\"Une Histoire de SPIE, Na√Ætre et rena√Ætre\\", p.112-115 (p.121-124 html version) The immediate postwar period was a prosperous one for SCB; the Monnet Plan allocated 50% of expenditure on civil engineering projects. Works included reconstruction of the Port of Le Havre, dams for EDF, including the 2000GWh Barrage de Donz√®re- Mondragon. In Algeria the Barrage de Foum-el-Gherza was constructed.Jean Monville et al, \\"Une Histoire de SPIE, Na√Ætre et rena√Ætre\\", p.117 (p.126 html version) In French Equatorial Africa through FIDES, and CAIFOM, (and in association with Schneider SA through a limited liability joint venture SCTP.) the company returned to pre-war success, such as with the extension of the port in Doula and the bridge over the Wouri, in Cameroon.Pierre Said Mohamed (1995), \\"L'irresistible d√©clin d'une firme prestigieuse : 1945‚Äì1954\\", pp.322‚Äì326 Additionally SCB agents began to seek potential contracts in South America and the Middle East; this led to work such as the extension of the port in Guayaquil, Ecuador. In South Africa the company's skill in building hyperbolic cooling towers brought orders for the subsidiary African Batignolles Construction Ltd.. By 1950 profits were not sufficient at 2.5% to cover the need for capital investments. It was the barrage in Edfina (near Metoubes, Egypt) that put SCB into financial deficit: The dam, built on the Rosetta canal was originally to be built by the Czech firm 'Hrabb Lozowski'. They were unable to complete the financial arrangements and the contract was passed to a 50/50 venture between SCB and the Netherlandsche Maatschappij Voor Haven. The Czech firm's costings turned out to be underestimates, and the attempts to re-negotiate the terms failed, additionally the unreliability of manpower due to the First Arab-Israeli war caused problems, as did poor Franco-Egyptian relations. The contract turned to litigation, but the case bogged down and by 1950 the company had already required major loans from the Cr√©dit National d'Escompte and the Cr√©dit Lyonnais banks. The losses were large and the company used a share issue to raise capital. On 6 May 1954 the Empain group through its holding SPIE acquired a 20% stake in the company. After the problems in Egypt the company focused on medium-sized projects, seeking a reliable income stream, and was involved in works on the River Rhine between Basel and Strasbourg. To compensate for the loss of markets due to French decolonisation the company became more involved in Latin America, and South Africa, and was contracted to build an airport in Indonesia (\\"Project Waru\\" : Juanda International Airport). The company income grew modestly in the late 1950s. In 1962 Jean-Edouard Empain became a director of the company. The company returned to large scale projects in an attempt to improve its profitability and the company also started to undertake building and property development projects. The company was still experiencing financial problems; in 1967 operating income was negative. In 1967 was decided to merge the company with the engineering company SPIE.Pierre Said Mohamed (1995), \\"L'Echec du relevement autonome : 1955‚Äì1968\\", pp.326‚Äì329 The merger took place in 1968 forming SPIE Batignolles. Legacy The company was part of Spie Batignolles; owned by the Schneider group until 1997, when it was divested as part of an AMEC leveraged management buyout. The company became Spie SA with three divisions ‚Äì Spie Batignolles became the name of the construction division. The SPIE group was acquired by AMEC in 2003 the construction division was acquired in September 2003 by the management and Barclays Private Equity Finance, by 2005 the company sought to sell the other SPIE assets. The electrical engineering, and rail divisions were sold separately between 2006 and 2007. Spie Batignolles continues to undertake civil engineering construction work.

He recorded it in Chicago in 1937 around the beginning of his incarceration at the infamous Parchman Prison Farm in Mississippi. It was his first recording for producer Lester Melrose and remains his best-known song. Several blues and other artists have adapted the song, often with variations on the lyrics and music. Background After several attempts at recording for Victor Records and Okeh Records in the early 1930s, Bukka White came to the attention of Vocalion Records' producer Lester Melrose. Melrose arranged for White to record a single in Chicago in 1937, but White was arrested and convicted for a shooting incident and received a two-year sentence at Parchman Farm. However, White did manage to record two songs\\"Shake 'Em On Down\\" and \\"Pinebluff, Arkansas\\"before serving his time, either by jumping bail or through an arrangement by Melrose. Original song \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\" was recorded September 2, 1937, by White on vocal and guitar with an unidentified second guitarist. The song is a moderate-tempo twelve-bar blues notated in 4/4 time in the key of E. Music writer Mark Humphrey has described the rhythm as \\"shuffling\\" and its lyrics as \\"risqu√©\\": The phrase \\"shake 'em on down\\" may have originated in White's claim that he extorted money from hobos when he was freighthopping trains in the early 1930s. The song became a best seller and blues historian Ted Gioia notes that his single \\"earned White the status of a celebrity within Parchman\\". Prior to his arrival at the Farm, the inmates and even guards contributed to the purchase of a guitar. White was largely exempt from the hardest work details and, in the evenings, spent a lot of time practicing. He often performed, sometimes with a small combo, including for the governor ‚Äì \\"When White performed for the governor of Mississippi, on the latter's visit to Parchman, he was surprised that the politician already knew about him\\", according to Gioia. White recalled the governor asking him: Largely on the strength of \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\", when White was released from prison, he was able to resume his recording career with Melrose and Vocalion, despite the shift in public taste that had taken place in the previous two and a half years. Renditions by other artists Following Bukka White's success, \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\" was recorded by several bluesmen. Some used White's title or a variation, such as \\"Ride 'Em On Down\\", \\"Break 'Em On Down\\", or \\"Truck 'Em On Down\\". Big Bill Broonzy recorded a similar version in 1938,Vocalion Records 4149 (1938) whose popularity surpassed the original. Other versions followed by Tommy McClennan,Bluebird Records 8347 (1939) Big Joe Williams,Bluebird 8969 (1941) and Robert Petway.Bluebird 8838 (1941) Ernest \\"Buddy\\" Lewis was one of the few people‚Äîwithout obvious ties to a Mississippi background‚Äîto record the tune, which he did in either 1949 or 1950.Pelican Records (Beaumont, Texas) Doctor Ross also recorded it, for Sam Phillips in 1952, but it was not released until many years later.Sun Records (1952) Eddie Taylor recorded a version as \\"Ride 'Em On Down\\" in 1955.Vee-Jay Records VJ 185 (1955) Mississippi Fred McDowell recorded several renditions, using both acoustic and electric slide guitar, including one for the 1972 album Live in New York. Beginning in the mid-1960s, rock artists have adapted the song. British rock band Savoy Brown recorded the song for their 1967 debut album Shake Down. Led Zeppelin's \\"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\\" (1970) uses some similar lyrics: Similar lyrics also appear in Led Zeppelin's song \\"Custard Pie\\" (1975): The Black Crowes recorded a live version, which was included on the Japanese release of The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion (1992). Recoil reworked a recording of Bukka White performing \\"Shake 'Em On Down\\" into \\"Electro Blues for Bukka White\\" on Bloodline (1992), and again into \\"Electro Blues for Bukka White (2000 Version)\\" on the \\"Jezebel\\" single (2000). R.L. Burnside recorded several versions, including one with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for A Ass Pocket of Whiskey (1996). The song was recorded by the North Mississippi Allstars for the Grammy-winning album Shake Hands with Shorty (2000). Their version was featured in the 2003 film Holes. HowellDevine adapted it for their third album, Modern Sounds of Ancient Juju (Arhoolie, 2014).

It is found on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean. Bivalves are molluscs with a body compressed between two usually similar shell valves joined by an elastic ligament. There are teeth at the edge of the shell, and the animal has a muscular foot, gills, siphons, mouth and gut and is surrounded by a mantle inside the shell. Taxonomy The genus Tellimya used to be included in the family Montacutidae but has now been transferred to Lasaeidae. Montagu originally described this species as Montacuta ferruginosa but it is currently placed in the genus Tellimya. Description This mollusc grows to up to eight millimetres in length and has a fragile, thin glossy shell. It is broadly oval in shape with the umbo or beak and the hinge being in the posterior half. The ligament joining the two valves is internal. The right valve has a single cardinal tooth which is a continuation of a ridge on the shell. The left valve has a single anterior lateral tooth and there are no posterior lateral teeth on either valve. The periostracum is thin and covered with a thick ferruginous deposit. This obscures the sculpture of concentric lines with a small number of faint radial lines. The anterior adductor scar is larger than the posterior one. The line made by the edge of the mantle is wide and the margin is entire. There are a number of tubercles along the ventral portion of the middle fold of the mantle. The interior of the shell is white and sometimes nacreous.Marine Species Identification Portal Distribution Tellimya ferruginosa occurs in the North Sea, round the British Isles, north to Norway and south to the Mediterranean Sea, Morocco and Madeira. Biology Tellimya ferruginosa lives under the surface of the sediment and prefers muddy sand. It is often found living as a commensal of the sea potato, Echinocardium cordatum. Up to fourteen of the bivalves have been found associated with one urchin.Fish, J.D. and Fish, S., (1996). A student's guide to the seashore. Second edition. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

Councillors standing down at the election included Gwen Richardson and Erica Shaw, while former Labour group leader David Potter and the former Conservative council leader from the 1980s and 1990s, Stephen Reid, attempted to return to the council. Meanwhile, independent councillor David Leeks, stood for the Conservatives after joining the party.

As an expert in healthcare artificial intelligence, Riskin has promoted healthcare quality improvement and helped shape policy in the US and globally. Riskin's companies, featured in Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, have influenced the care of millions of patients.;; He continues to practice, teach, and perform research as Adjunct Professor of Surgery and Adjunct Professor of Biomedical Informatics Research at Stanford University. Early life and education Riskin was born on October 15, 1971 and grew up in Los Angeles, California. He began writing software at age 5, selling software at age 12, and winning regional awards in software programming during grammar school. As a teenager, Riskin studied at Brentwood High School, where he received the Bausch and Lomb Outstanding Scientist Award. He began college at age 16 as a Regent‚Äôs Scholar at University of California, San Diego.https://www.linkedin.com/in/danriskin/ He received a medical degree from Boston University and completed surgery residency at University of California, Los Angeles and a critical care and acute care surgery fellowship at Stanford University. He earned an MBA with focus in bioinformatics and bioengineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Upon completion of his training in 2008, Riskin was promoted to Consulting Assistant Professor of Surgery at Stanford University.  Business  While a student at MIT and Stanford in 2005, Riskin designed a painless wound closure device for which he later was issued US patents and FDA approval. Riskin cofounded Wadsworth Medical Technologies, which commercialized the product under the Dermaloc brand. The company was acquired by DQ Holdings and the product was rebranded DermaClip for sales in the US and China. The product has been used successfully on hundreds of thousands of patients. In 2008, Riskin joined Mohr Davidow Ventures as Entrepreneur in Residence and the Obama Campaign Health Advisory Committee and the Health IT Subcommittee. He was subsequently funded by the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation to develop advanced technology to enable value-based healthcare. In 2011, Riskin founded and became CEO of Health Fidelity, a company which implements artificial intelligence to measure clinical quality and risk for value-based healthcare. As CEO, Riskin secured relationships with Harvard, Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia, and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He grew the company through three rounds of financing;;; and transitioned company leadership on a $29 million round.; Health Fidelity has become prominent in value-based healthcare, with one customer saying that Health Fidelity \\"added approximately $200 million in revenue\\" to their business. After Health Fidelity, Riskin returned to public service, testifying on the 21st Century Cures Initiative in 2014. In Congressional retreat and briefings, he discussed approaches to leverage newly collected health data to refine the standard of care. Riskin was funded to pursue this work by the National Institutes of Health starting in 2015 and the National Science Foundation in 2018.; This led to creation of Verantos, a company focused on using real world evidence to tailor therapy and support personalized medicine. As CEO, Riskin secured relationships with multiple top 10 biopharma firms and published on advanced scientific approaches for tailored therapy. Policy and public service Riskin has advocated a bipartisan approach to leverage clinical data to improve US healthcare quality. He described two decades of health data reform. The first, from 2010 - 2020, would institute electronic data capture and enable value-based healthcare. The second decade, from 2020 - 2030, would leverage the massive amounts of collected data to tailor therapy and enable personalized medicine. Focusing on the first decade of healthcare data reform, capturing electronic information and improving value-based workflow, Riskin promoted a transition to electronic health records and use of data to improve care within the Obama Campaign Healthcare Advisory Committee starting in 2007. These efforts were enacted through the HITECH Act in 2009 and Affordable Care Act in 2010. Riskin's academic work \\"Re-examining health IT policy: What will it take to derive value from our investment?\\" encouraged national discussion on innovation and analytics. He founded and build a company, Health Fidelity, with a vision to capture accurate electronic information and improve value- based workflow. Focusing on the second decade of healthcare data reform, tailoring therapy based on real world evidence, Riskin provided Congressional testimony in the 21st Century Cures Initiative in 2014. He met in Congressional retreat to help refine the law in 2015. The 21st Century Cures Act, passed in December 2016, included a pathway to incorporate real world evidence into regulatory decision-making. Riskin's academic work \\"Real world evidence in cardiovascular medicine: assuring data validity in electronic health record-based studies\\" described an approach to use advanced technology and data to enable credible real world evidence. He founded and built a company, Verantos, with a vision to refine the standard of care based on real world evidence. Riskin has continued to focus national attention on healthcare quality as a member of the HHS Quality Measurement Task Force, in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Grand Rounds, in FDA Grand Rounds and workshops, and through academic publication.

Holland is an English theoretical physicist, known for his work on foundational problems in quantum physics and in particular his book on the pilot wave theory and the de Broglie-Bohm causal interpretation of quantum mechanics. Holland was educated at Hazelwick Comprehensive School in Crawley, West Sussex and at Imperial College. He did his Ph.D. on algebraic topological methods in physics under David Bohm at Birkbeck College. Holland has worked at the University of London, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris), Bristol UWE and the University of Oxford. He is an editor of Physics Letters A.Peter Holland, Quantum physics homepage In 1993, Holland published his book ‚ÄúThe Quantum Theory of Motion‚Äô‚Äô in which he presented a comprehensive account of the causal interpretation of quantum mechanics initiated by Louis de Broglie and, in a more complete form, by David Bohm. ;Recent work Drawing upon numerical trajectory-based methods for solving the Schr√∂dinger equation, and upon methods of hydrodynamics, Holland showed in 2004 how the time evolution of the wavefunction could be derived exactly from the dynamical evolution of a congruence of spacetime trajectories. The method achieves the same result as Richard Feynman's path integral formulation (the mapping of the initial wavefunction through time) but, instead of using Feynman's 'all possible paths' between two points, it employs at most one path. This is a considerable conceptual advantage in understanding quantum motion and is potentially a computational benefit too. Another difference with Feynman is that, while the trajectories do the job of evolving the quantum system in time, the initial wavefunction is integral to the trajectory dynamical equations, as it provides the initial density and the initial velocity. Using Riemannian geometry Holland formulated this method in very general terms that includes as special cases quantum many-particle systems and spin. He has applied it to other field theories such as electromagnetism and second-order wave equations. Holland has published many peer-reviewed articles on the foundations of physics including the quantum potential, quantum hydrodynamics, quantum field theory, symmetries, hidden-variables theories, quantum back-reaction, quantum Hamilton-Jacobi theory, classical-like quantum systems, and the history of physics.

The episode was written by Melinda Hsu Taylor and directed by Fred Toye. Tom and his team are sent to scout out an old motorcycle shop, and Weaver insists he take Pope along. After arriving at the store, Pope manages to escape and attacks a nest of sleeping Skitters, attracting the attention of nearby Mechs. Meanwhile, Anne attempts to communicate with the captured Skitter.  Plot  The Skitter that Tom captured is being held in a cage. Anne and Harris are given the task of studying it. The Skitter seemed to become angrier by the sight of Tom, who tells it that he remembers him. Pope tells Weaver that there is a motorcycle shop nearby. He tells Tom to take a team to get the bikes. Tom reluctantly agrees to let Pope accompany them. Tom, Hal, Dai, Anthony, and Pope set out on a country road. Tom tells Dai that he worries about his sons. Tom says that his wife could have handled the situation with Hal better than him. Anne shows the Skitter pictures, hoping to learn how to communicate with it. Harris thinks this is a waste of time. Scott shows Weaver a radio he made. Matt is given the responsibility of monitoring communications on the radio. On their hunt for bikes, the group see a group of Skitters sleeping upside down like bats. Pope wants to shoot them down, but Tom decides to leave them alone after Dai reports that there are Mechs nearby. Anne starts to give the Skitter water to drink as Harris walks in with the dead Skitter that Pope and his gang killed. This aggravates the Skitter that is still alive. Before eating, Lourdes says a prayer. Weaver notices her and tells her she is lucky to still \\"believe in something.\\" At the motorcycle shop, the gang prepares to get the bikes. Hal finds a locket that Karen would have liked. Tom and Hal talk about Karen. Both Tom and Hal agree that Hal's mother was always better at this parenting thing than Tom. Back at the high school, Harris prepares to cut into the Skitter. Anne tells him he can't do that because the Skitter is a living creature. She says their job is to learn to communicate with the Skitter, not to kill it, but Harris disagrees. Mike's son Rick wakes up but doesn't recognize his father. Mike confronts the Skitter and threatens to kill it if it doesn't begin communicating with him. When the Skitter does not begin communicating with Mike, Mike thrusts his gun into the Skitter's mouth. The Skitter falls unconscious to the ground. Harris tells Anne and Mike that he found a \\"pressure point\\" near the Skitter's soft palate. Anne notices that interference came onto the radio both times the Skitter was provoked and theorizes that Skitters may have \\"radios in their heads\\" that they use to communicate with each other. However, while the Skitters communicate at radio- frequencies, their communications only have roughly the same range as a human voice, so the captured Skitter cannot alert the other aliens. Anne attempts to perform an autopsy on the old Skitter corpse from Pope's hideout, but it has been dead for too long, and the insides have already rotted into \\"mush.\\" As the gang prepares to leave the motorbike store, Pope knocks Dai out and escapes on a motorcycle. He goes back to the sleeping Skitters and blows them up with a few grenades attached to a can of gasoline. Rick wakes up and reattaches the \\"harness\\" to his back. Scott's radio experiences interference waves at this time and Mike runs in to find Rick about to let the Skitter out. Harris communicates with the Skitter through Rick, asking the Skitter through Rick what the Skitter wants from them. Mike runs over and rips the \\"harness\\" off his son, knocking his son out. A group of armed \\"harnessed kids\\" finds Tom and the others. The kids fire, shooting Dai in the leg. Anthony suggests that they shoot back, but Tom says no. The kids move together, only shooting when there is a target. Tom makes a Molotov cocktail and throws it under a car. The kids open fire on the car. Hal and Anthony get away, but Tom and Dai are ambushed by a Skitter. Dai kills it, and they drive away. Tom tells Weaver that he will look for the drugs needed for the operations and then go look for Ben. Weaver says that if his child was still alive, nothing on earth could keep him from going after him. Tom and Hal talk about Ben. Hal mentions that he's worried that Ben will be different when he gets back. Tom tells Hal that Ben is strong. Later, Tom goes to eat and is surprised to see fresh bread. Margaret tells him that it's a parting gift from Pope. Around the table, Tom, Hal, Matt, Dai, Anthony, Anne, and Lourdes share what they are thankful for and then hold hands and pray before their meal. Weaver, sitting at the next table, quietly whispers along with them.  Production   Development  The episode was written by Melinda Hsu Taylor and it was directed by Fred Toye. Melinda Hsu Taylor later writes the second part of the two part Sanctuary episode. Fred Toye later directs Silent Kill. Greg Beeman stated in his blog that a difficult production problem the crew faced were the scenes involving the caged Skitter. The Skitter was designed and built by Todd Masters in Vancouver. Beeman stated that the alien \\"really looked real on set and it worked flawlessly.\\" In Prisoner of War the Skitter that attacked Tom was a full-scale animatronic puppet. It took five people to operate it. The crew shot the episode in the summer and \\"the guy inside the suit was buried beneath six inches of foam rubber.\\" The Skitter suit caused him to heat up quickly. He could only go ten or fifteen minutes between takes, at which time he would need to take a break, which was time consuming.  Reception   Ratings  In its original American broadcast, \\"Grace\\" was seen by an estimated 4.07 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. \\"Grace\\" received a 1.4 rating among viewers between ages 18 and 49, which is down a tenth versus the previous episode‚Äôs 1.5 rating.  Reviews  The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-. Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic said of the episode: \\"Not every episode can feature a major battle between the survivors and the aliens, for both production reasons and storyline reasons. The show wouldn't last half a season if that were the case. But Falling Skies has done a strong enough job building up characters that \\"Grace\\" felt like more than filler.

In 1661, upon the discovery that Bahai had purposely omitted troop losses in this battle in his reports, he was deprived of his hereditary rank of baron. Nonetheless in 1662 he was appointed the first military-governor of Ninguta. In 1673, he was rewarded for his success in organizing a tribe of natives called the Meljere into 40 companies known as the New Manchus (Êñ∞ÊªøÊ¥≤), as a result he was given a minor hereditary rank five years later. In 1676 he removed his headquarters to a city west of Ninguta, called Kirin, and from 1682-83 took part in the preparations for attacking the Russians at Albazin. However he was deprived of all offices in 1683 after he false reported a famine that did not exist.

A small admittance fee is required to access the park, but individuals or groups may purchase a membership that allows access to the eleven parks operated by the Grand River Conservation Authority. It is a popular destination for many local residents, with over 65,000 patrons visiting every year to enjoy the geological attractions of the park, as well as the historic ruins of the Rockwood Woolen Mills. Location Located in Rockwood, Ontario and situated a short distance from the city of Guelph, this conservation area is on both sides of the Eramosa River and is a central location within Southern Ontario. The nearby Highway 401 and Highway 7 allows this conservation area to be easily accessible from some of Southern Ontario‚Äôs major cities, such as Toronto. History Ruins of the old Mill. The Rockwood Woolen Mill was established in 1867 by brothers John Richard, Thomas, and Joseph Harris, and their brother-in-law Thomas Wetherald. The firm advertised in publications in nearby cities such as Guelph, Milton, and Georgetown. The business thrived. Over the years, the mill was powered by the water of the Eramosa River, hydro, and steam. In the 1880s, a fire harshly damaged the mill. It was replaced by a stone structure in 1884. One of the founding brothers, John Richard Harris, died in 1899; as a result, his sons took over the business. During the First World War, the mill would frequently operate 24 hours a day, securing vast orders for Canadian army blankets. The mill closed its doors in 1931, in the midst of the Great Depression. Stone walls of the old woolen mills at Rockwood Conservation Area. After the closure of the mill, William Harris, son of John Richard, transformed the site into a private park named Hi-Pot-Lo Park. In 1959 the Grand River Conservation Authority obtained the mill and land from Harris, and the official opening of the park took place in 1963.\\"Rockwood Conservation Area marks 50 years\\" Guelph Mercury. Retrieved 2013-11-10. A large restoration of the mill ruins was completed over the winter of 2010, allowing it to be open to the public for the 2011 season. Environmental features The Rockwood Conservation Area has a rich and unique geological aspect. A few specific features that are a part of the environment at the Rockwood conservation area include glacier bluffs, potholes, caves and some of the oldest dated trees in Ontario. The cave system includes a series of 12 caves, which is one of the most extensive networks in Ontario. Within the caves is a prominent feature called flowstone, which over many years is created by flowing water that deposits a type of calcium carbonate called calcite. Another feature at Rockwood are the potholes. Within the conservation area, there is over 200 potholes that all vary in measurements. These potholes are also known as giant's kettles, which are large cavities that have been drilled by flowing water carrying stones and gravel. As well, glacial bluffs are seen at Rockwood. These have been formed over thousands of years after the earth‚Äôs most recent ice age ended. They can be relatively small and get as large as 30 meters deep and 200 meters wide. Wildlife A female wild turkey with juveniles While the area consists of wildlife typical to most of southern Ontario, such as deer, coyotes, raccoons, opossums, skunks, beavers, ducks and geese. The Rockwood area has a varied supply of fish that includes perch, crappie, rock bass, sunfish and chub. A more recent addition to the wildlife at Rockwood has been the reintroduction of wild turkeys. Due to unregulated hunting, wild turkeys were at one point completely gone. However, eastern wild turkeys from the southern United States were introduced to this area within the past 20 years and are now permanent residents. Activities Camping The Rockwood Conservation Area has around 105 campsites in four main campgrounds, serviced and unserviced campsites are available on a daily term. Other facilities include washrooms and a concession. Fishing Fishing is permitted within the Eramosa River. The Grand River Conservation Area and the Ministry of Natural Resources fill the waters once a year with rainbow trout in a goal to promote fishing. Trails With occasionally high cliffs and steep inclines, the two main trails allow hikers to travel beside the river‚Äôs edge and within the forest. Accessible by wheelchairs in most areas, these trails can be reached from either the beach or the mill ruins. Swimming There is a large sandy beach in the conservation area which allows visitors to go swimming during the summer. There is no beach patrol in this area, however a life-jacket loaner program is offered. Recreation A mini golf course is located near the front entrance as well as a playground for children. Canoeing is one of the more popular activities at the conservation area. Canoes, kayaks and paddleboards can be rented on weekends during the summer. Rockwood Nature Centre The Grand River Conservation Authority operates the Rockwood Nature Centre in Rockwood Park.

In the exchange, the client begins by making a cleartext request, which is later upgraded to a newer HTTP protocol version or switched to a different protocol. A connection upgrade must be requested by the client; if the server wants to enforce an upgrade it may send a \`426 Upgrade Required\` response. The client can then send a new request with the appropriate upgrade headers while keeping the connection open. Use with TLS One use is to begin a request on the normal HTTP port but switch to Transport Layer Security (TLS). In practice such use is rare, with HTTPS being a far more common way to initiate encrypted HTTP. The server returns a \`426\` status code to alert legacy clients that the failure was client-related (\`400\` level codes indicate a client failure). This method for establishing a secure connection is advantageous because it: * Does not require messy and problematic URL redirection on the server side; * Enables virtual hosting of secured websites (although HTTPS also allows this using Server Name Indication); and * Reduces the potential for user confusion by providing a single way to access a particular resource. If the same resources are available from the server via both encrypted secure means and unencrypted clear means, a man-in-the-middle may maintain an unencrypted and unauthenticated connection with the client while maintaining an encrypted connection with the server. Disadvantages of this method include: * The client cannot specify the requirement for a secure HTTP in the URI (though the client can require such via the upgrade negotiation); and * Since HTTP is defined on a hop basis, HTTP tunneling may be required to bypass proxy servers. Use with WebSocket WebSocket also uses this mechanism to set up a connection with a HTTP server in a compatible way. The WebSocket Protocol has two parts: a handshake to establish the upgraded connection, then the actual data transfer. First, a client requests a WebSocket connection by using the \`Upgrade: WebSocket\` and \`Connection: Upgrade\` headers, along with a few protocol-specific headers to establish the version being used and set up a handshake. The server, if it supports the protocol, replies with the same \`Upgrade: WebSocket\` and \`Connection: Upgrade\` headers and completes the handshake. Once the handshake is completed successfully, data transfer begins. Use with HTTP/2 The HTTP Upgrade mechanism is used to establish HTTP/2 starting from plain HTTP. The client starts an HTTP/1.1 connection and sends an \`Upgrade: h2c\` header. If the server supports HTTP/2, it replies with HTTP 101 Switching Protocol status code. The HTTP Upgrade mechanism is used only for cleartext HTTP2 (h2c). In the case of HTTP2 over TLS (h2), the ALPN TLS protocol extension is used instead.

Located in Lebanon, it includes the cities of Beirut and Byblos, and in terms of population, it is the largest Melkite eparchy in the Middle East. Its current Eparch, Georges Wadih Bacouni, S.M.S.P., was elected in November 2018. Territory and statistics The territory of the archeparchy includes Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and its environs; much of Mount Lebanon governorate (to the north Antelias, Jounieh, and Byblos; to the east Baabda, Broumana, and Bikfaya) and south to part of Chouf District. The archeparchy has an estimated population of 200,000 Melkite faithful in 2015. Its cathedral is dedicated to Saint Elias and its see is located in Beirut. It includes 114 priests, 83 men religious, 179 women religious, and 83 parishes.catholic-hierarchy.org History The Eparchy of Beirut is an ancient Byzantine one, elevated to the rank of archeparchy with the Council of Chalcedon in the fifth century. The Greek Catholic Eparchy of Beirut was officially founded in 1724, after the Patriarch of Antioch was divided into two branches, the Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic (or Melkite). Statistical data from the Annuario Pontificio 2010. In 1701, the Greek bishohop of Beirut, Sylvester Dahan, had sent to Rome a profession of the Catholic faith, renewed in the following year. Those were the years when Catholicism obtained great progress in the ranks of the Greeks in the cities of the Lebanese coast, where more entrenched was the presence of Christians of the Byzantine Rite, and this mainly thanks to the missionary work of the Jesuits and the Capuchins. Great impetus to the spread of Catholicism in Beirut and in the surrounding areas was the founding of the Chouerites, that at the beginning of their history had most of the monasteries in Beirutian territory. Belonged to this Order was Athanasios Dahan, Catholic Bishop of Beirut and the future patriarch, who first organized the new Catholic diocese. With his successor Basilios Jelghaf the cathedral was built on land owned by the Chouerites. A dispute between the Order and the Bishop Youssef Sarrouf about the real estate of the cathedral forced the Holy See to intervene to give reason to the Bishop (1784). The bishop Agapios Riashi[Consacrato il 5 settembre 1828 con il nome di Agapios, ma confermato dalla Santa Sede solo il 20 aprile successivo.] was one of the most vocal opponents of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar desired by Patriarch Maximos III Mazloum. Riashi was responsible for the reconstruction of the cathedral in a more impressive and rich decorations including an iconostasis in marble. This church was demolished in the twentieth century for urban needs. On the death of Agapios Riashi in 1878 the Melkite community is divided on the choice of his successor. The Chouerites, which so far had given all the bishops of Beirut, and they considered the seat as their fiefdom, lived a difficult time and had no monks prepared for the episcopate. Patriarch Gregory II Youssef was Damascene and Melkite Beirut feared that ended up imposing a native bishop of Damascus. Eventually prevailed to the Holy See, when Pope Leo XIII with his Papal brief Occasione electionis on August 16, 1881, chose Meletios Fakak transferring him from his see in Zahleh and appointing to new Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Beirut and Byblos. The former Eparchy of Beirut was elevated to the rank of the Archeparchy, uniting it to the seat of Byblos, formerly administered by the bishops of Beirut since 1802. Byblos corresponds to the ancient Byzantine Diocese of Byblos, mentioned in the fourth century. Fakak made his solemn entry only September 30, 1882.

The work was subtitled: Verses addressed to the noble and unfortunate Lady Emilia V, now imprisoned in the convent of. The title is Greek for \\"concerning or about a little soul\\", from epi, \\"around\\", \\"about\\"; and psychidion, \\"little soul\\". Background Countess Teresa Viviani, the daughter of the governor of Pisa, was nineteen years old. Her father had placed her in the Convent of Saint Anna.The Saint Anna Church and Convent had been established in 1406, while the church was finished in 1426, by the Order of the Benedictine Nuns. Shelley had visited her several times and had corresponded with her briefly. After the work was published by Charles and James Ollier in London, Shelley requested them to withdraw it. One possible concern was that readers would interpret the poem biographically. Shelley referred to it as \\"an idealized history of my life and feelings\\". The poem contains autobiographical elements, consisting of 604 lines written for Viviani, whom Shelley met while she was \\"imprisoned\\" in 1820. The theme of the work is a meditation on the nature of ideal love. Shelley advocates free love, criticising conventional marriage, which he described as \\"the weariest and the longest journey\\". Epipsychidion opens with an invocation to Emilia as a spiritual sister of the speaker. He addresses her as a \\"captive bird\\" for whose nest his poem will be soft rose petals. He calls her an angel of light, the light of the moon seen through mortal clouds, a star beyond all storms. In a letter of 18 June 1822, Shelley described the work: Epipsychidion was composed at Pisa, in January and February 1821, and was published anonymously in 1821 by Charles and James Ollier, London. The poem was included by Mary Shelley in the Poetical Works in 1839, both editions. The Bodleian Library has a first draft of Epipsychidion, \\"consisting of three versions, more or less complete, of the 'Preface [Advertisement]'; a version in ink and pencil, much cancelled, of the last eighty lines of the poem; and some additional lines which did not appear in print\\".Locock, C.D. Examination of the Shelley manuscripts in the Bodleian Library. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1903, page 3.

Previously, it was developed and released in November 2012 by Sony Online Entertainment. It is a sequel of PlanetSide, which originally released in 2003. PlanetSide 2 uses the Forgelight Engine, which is able to support thousands of players in continuous large scale conflict on a single map. As in the first PlanetSide, PlanetSide 2 chronicles the efforts of three factions as they fight for territorial control of the planet Auraxis. PlanetSide 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 in June 2015. PlanetSide 2 holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest first-person shooter battle, with over 1158 players being recorded in a single battle. Gameplay PlanetSide 2 is a re- imagining of PlanetSide, featuring the same world and factions, and taking place at roughly the same time period. As in the previous game, it features territory control in open-world, large battles featuring up to 2000 players per continent on foot or in land/air vehicles. The territory system differs greatly from that of the original, being more free-form and based on a hexagonal territory control system. Former SOE took into account balance issues from the first game. As stated by creative director Matthew Higby, the developers created a system to reward combatants on lower population empires through mechanics such as proportionally increased advancement rates and resources to aid the balance of overall empire saturation on each server as much as possible without force-restricting players from being able to play with their friends. PlanetSide 2 is a faster-paced game than the original Planetside and can potentially allow for thousands of players. It also features typical first person shooter elements such as sprinting, iron sights, and regenerating shields. An important aspect is that player skill and teamwork are major determiners when it comes to being able to kill other players and overcome opposing teams. Unlockable skills are available and offer different advantages over enemies in battle. The game also features a day and night cycle, meaning that battles happen at different times of day, which affects gameplay, as night time can provide adequate cover for coordinated attacks. Combat takes place on the continents of the fictional planet Auraxis, which are broken up into numerous territories. Control of territories provides bonuses to a faction in adjacent sectors. The mission system is partly automated and partly controlled by players. It provides focal points for players to attack and defend and helps players get into the action quickly. As the player participates in productive activities such as killing enemies, healing or repairing allies, or capturing bases, they earn experience, which increases their character's \\"Battle Rank,\\" or level, and rewards them with certifications or \\"Certs.\\" Certifications allow the player to specialize in certain roles by allowing them to improve weapons, vehicles or tools they use. Many certifications require the player to invest in upgrade tiers of the certification, which increase the certification's efficiency. For example, the player can purchase five ranks of Nanoweave Armor, which when equipped reduce damage taken from infantry weapons. Using the certification system, the player is able to customize how they play using different classes or vehicles. For example, the player can purchase certifications to alter the main function of the Sunderer vehicle, such as the ability to repair or restock the ammunition of nearby allied vehicles and aircraft. Another currency, called \\"ISO-4\\", is used for \\"Implants\\" which resemble Perks in Call of Duty. Continents can be captured, or \\"locked,\\" by a specific faction. This is done when a faction gains 100 \\"Empire Strength\\" from capturing territory, triggering an \\"Alert\\", which lasts for 90 minutes. Whichever faction controls the most territory by the end of the alert locks the continent and gets rewarded with Certs and ISO-4. A combat advantage is given to the faction that locked the continent, such as decreased cost of aircraft, or less overheating on turrets. Another continent opens up immediately afterward. There are other types of Alerts that are done at random times which involve capturing different kinds of bases and facilities, and award semi-permanent Empire Strength points (until the continent is locked). An update was released in late April 2016 that allowed players to construct their own bases by harvesting \\"Cortium\\", a new mineral that appears throughout the world. Using a vehicle known as the ANT (Advanced Nanite Transport), players harvest the mineral and deploy a variety of structures, such as bunkers, rampart walls and Sunderer garages. Players can also deploy turrets, artillery, silos (where players store their Cortium) and modules, which include adding AI to friendly turrets, automatically repairing nearby structures, and enabling orbital strikes within a certain radius. In early March 2020, PlanetSide 2 received a major update called \\"Escalation\\". This update expanded the Outfit system. Outfits are player-led communities analogous to clans in other games. The update allowed Outfits to call massive spacecraft called \\"Bastion Fleet Carriers\\" down to the battlefield for a limited amount of time. Story Although the story is very similar to the original, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) announced that award-winning author Marv Wolfman has joined the SOE team to write the ongoing historic fiction for the game. This is the first time the PlanetSide franchise narrative has been detailed. There are also many lore videos on YouTube that can provide some insight on how the war for Auraxis came to be. Factions *Terran Republic: An authoritarian colonial government that leverages military might to maintain strict control over the colonial citizens, ostensibly on behalf of the mother Terran Republic back on Earth. The Terran Republic is obsessed with the preservation of law and order, and see the insurrectionary war against themselves as all the more justification for strong-armed countermeasures. They are thus seen by their opponents to be an oppressive and dictatorial force, but many also view the TR as the only hope for lasting security and peace on Auraxis. Their colors are red and black. TR forces are distinguished by their use of rapid fire conventional weaponry, large-capacity magazines, high speed medium tanks and fast flying fighter aircraft. *New Conglomerate: The New Conglomerate operates as a loosely organized band of self-proclaimed freedom fighters. Viewed as corporate-backed terrorist guerrillas by their adversaries, they violently oppose the stranglehold that the Terran Republic has on Auraxis. Led by an unusual quorum of outcasts, frontier industrialists, pirates, and turncoat military leaders, the New Conglomerate is unwavering and prepared to achieve freedom from oppression by any means necessary. Their colors are blue and gold. NC forces use hard hitting electromagnetic weapons such as gauss and railguns that are devastating at short and medium range but are bulky and unwieldy with moderate reload speeds. They employ durable, heavily-armed shock troops with slow, well-armored heavy tanks and heavy fighters loaded with arrays of crushingly powerful ordnance. *Vanu Sovereignty: The Vanu Sovereignty are a secretive and cult-like group who believe that only through the untapped power of ancient alien technology can humanity truly evolve towards the next phase of its existence. They are a technologically advanced and cunning faction, employing powerful reverse- engineered alien technologies on the battlefield. Their singular purpose is to uncover the secrets hidden away in ancient artifacts scattered over the surface of Auraxis, and as such they view the war with its shifting territories and militarized zones as a pointless impedance to their infinitely more important work. They fight only to seize and retain uninterruptible, or exclusive, access to alien artifacts, research and excavation sites, and other scientific materials. Their colors are violet and cyan. The Vanu use advanced plasma and laser weaponry on the battlefield, characterized by lack of bullet drop, high accuracy, low recoil, and quick-re-loadable energy cells. They deploy highly maneuverable, levitating battle tanks known as Magriders capable of efficiently traversing almost any terrain or incline, as well as wraith like anti-gravity fighters known as Scythes capable of inertia-defying breakneck aerobatics. Development Promotion at E3 2012 The first official indications that a PlanetSide sequel was in development appeared in 2009. On September 25, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) sent a mass e-mail to current and former PlanetSide subscribers, asking to fill a survey that would help SOE design the next generation PlanetSide. \\"We plan to expand the PlanetSide universe with another game and we need your help with the design. After all, who knows the game better than you, our customers, the people who actually play it! Don't worry about the original PlanetSide, it isn't going anywhere.\\" In addition, SOE registered the domain www.PlanetSide2.com on September 21. On October 11, SOE president John Smedley posted on his LiveJournal account that the sequel's working title is PlanetSide Next. Little was revealed about the sequel until December 2010, when Smedley said that SOE would be launching a first-person shooter in March 2011, which was soon confirmed by Paul Williams of SOE as referring to PlanetSide Next. On March 31, 2011, SOE announced that it would be ending development of their spy-themed MMO The Agency and refocusing efforts on EverQuest Next and PlanetSide Next. Smedley confirmed that PlanetSide Next had been delayed ‚Äì the result of recently switching to a new game engine ‚Äì and would be available later in the year. The working title was later changed to PlanetSide 2. The official website was later updated to show a video trailer of the upcoming game. Many interview videos were taken after that showing sections of gameplay, but the biggest off-screen game play video was shown at 2012's GDC, showing most of the game aspects. SOE President John Smedley announced that a closed beta test would begin July 30 or 31 2012 \\"barring any unforeseen circumstances.\\". On July 30 Smedley announced that the beta testing would be delayed until at least August 3 \\"to make sure some stuff is awesome.\\". On August 3 Smedley announced that the closed Beta would commence 2pm PDT (GMT-7) Monday 6 August. The beta closed on November 17, 2012, pending the game's official release November 20, 2012. Game engine The game uses SOE's Forgelight Engine which in turn uses Nvidia's PhysX API for its physics engine. This enables more realistic vehicle handling compared to the previous PlanetSide. Weather and day/night cycles are also possible as well as volumetric fog and clouds which players can hide in. Bullets are also simulated by the physics engine so players (other than the Vanu Sovereignty, whose projectiles are not affected by gravity if using some weapons) will need to compensate for gravity while aiming. Another improvement over PlanetSide is the introduction of locational damage (hitboxes) for soldiers and vehicles. This is customizable by the developers so that a sniper rifle shot to the head can have a huge bonus while high rate of fire weapons, such as the Mini Chain gun, and vehicles have small to no bonus. Business model PlanetSide 2 is free-to-play and includes a cash shop for players to purchase in-game convenience items and cosmetic changes using real money. For example, a player can purchase camouflage (paint) for their weapon or vehicle. The developers have indicated an admiration of League of Legendss freemium business model. In 2011, SOE CEO John Smedley said the cash shop \\"will not sell a more powerful gun or vehicle.\\" During the beta for the game, Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Nathan Grayson noted that the cash shop sold secondary weapons for aircraft, but changes have since been made to the game before it left beta. The game also offers a subscription which provides players with increased experience, cert points, and extra resources, which are used to acquire things such as grenades and medical kits. Grayson said that goal of these benefits were convenience rather than making subscribed players more powerful than other players. However, Grayson noted that people purchasing these offerings might then be able to quickly acquire a large number of powerful items. Creative director Matt Higby said, \\"success on the battlefield is still entirely player skill based, [players purchasing cash shop offerings will] just be less impacted for re-deploying to the battlefield. That is a huge benefit, no denying it. Is that 'buying power'? Well, that depends on your definition.\\" People are also able to create cosmetic items for the game with the Player Studio which are then sold for cash. Release PlanetSide 2 launched November 20, 2012. European players were initially unable to play due to an incorrect game launcher on the Steam platform in addition to EU server issues. Sony Online Entertainment's President John Smedley mentioned that a Mac version might be planned for PlanetSide 2. Smedley said: \\"I absolutely strongly share that view. No you aren't going to see PlanetSide 2 on Linux. You will see it on Mac though\\". The official PlanetSide 2 Twitter account responded to a question on the topic of a Mac version as \\"Stay tuned for all potential updates. ^Spoiler\\". A PlayStation 4 version of the game has been said to be released alongside Sony's new console November 2013. After the console launch when the game was not released, players learned that the launch has been rescheduled sometime in late 2014.

Two species are recognized: D. major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single fragment of the lower jaw, and D. chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D. chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown. Some features of the teeth differentiate Dermotherium from both living colugo species, but other features are shared with only one of the two. The third lower incisor, lower canine, and third lower premolar at least are pectinate or comblike, bearing longitudinal rows of tines or cusps, an unusual feature of colugos (the first two lower incisors are unknown in Dermotherium). The fourth lower premolar instead resembles the lower molars. The front part of these teeth, the trigonid, is broader in D. chimaera than in D. major, which is known only from the second and third lower molars. The two species also differ in the configuration of the inner back corner of the lower molars. The upper molars are triangular teeth bearing a number of distinct small cusps, particularly on the second upper molar, and with wrinkled enamel. Taxonomy A Sunda colugo (Galeopterus variegatus), a living relative of Dermotherium Colugos are a small group of Southeast Asian gliding mammals closely related to the primates. Their fossil record is exceptionally poor. Although Paleogene groups such as the Plagiomenidae are considered by some to be closely related to colugos, no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo family, Cynocephalidae, had been reported until 1992. In that year, St√©phane Ducrocq and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the Eocene of Thailand as a new genus and species of colugo, Dermotherium major. In 2000, however, Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that Dermotherium might not be a colugo, since the fossil is so poorly preserved that few traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported dermopteran features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other placental groups. Mary Silcox and colleagues reaffirmed the colugo affinities of Dermotherium in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in molar morphology. In 2006, Laurent Marivaux and colleagues described a second species of Dermotherium, D. chimaera, from material from the Oligocene of Thailand. They gave it the specific name chimaera (Latin for \\"chimera\\") because it shares characters with both the Philippine colugo (Cynocephalus volans) and Sunda colugo (Galeopterus variegatus), the two living colugo species. In addition, they tentatively identified a fossil from the Oligocene of Pakistan as Dermotherium chimaera and regarded some fossils from the Eocene of Myanmar as indeterminate dermopterans. According to a phylogenetic analysis carried out by Marivaux and colleagues, D. chimaera, D. major, and the Myanmar dermopteran are successive sister groups of the two living colugos. Description Known material of Dermotherium includes a handful of jaw fragments and isolated teeth. Dermotherium major is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The holotype of Dermotherium chimaera is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the deciduous third lower premolar are visible. X-ray microtomography reveals the unerupted lower third incisor (i3), canine (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2). The tentatively referred material of this species from Pakistan includes a single M2. The two species of Dermotherium were about as large as the Philippine colugo and larger than the Sunda colugo and differed from both in a number of characteristics of the dentition. Not enough is known of the skeleton of Dermotherium to assess whether the animal already possessed the gliding adaptations of living colugos. The two species are similar in size, but again differ in details of the dentition. In two specimens of D. chimaera, the length and width of the m2 are 5 and 4.3 mm and 5.4 and 4.8 mm respectively; this tooth is 5.4 mm long and 4.9 mm wide in the only known specimen of Dermotherium major. The Pakistani M2 of Dermotherium is 4.3 mm long and 6 mm wide, compared to 4.7 and 6.6 mm in the only known M2 of D. chimaera from Thailand. The lower jaw of Dermotherium major resembles that of living colugos in the presence of a strong angular process (a projecting piece of bone at the lower side of the back of the jawbone) and a retromolar space (a flat space behind the last molars). The coronoid process (a projecting piece of bone directly behind the molars) rises steeply, with its front wall virtually vertical. Lower dentition The i3 of Dermotherium chimaera is an elongate tooth bearing six tines (narrow, high \\"fingers\\" as in a comb) arranged from front to back. The frontmost is larger, the next four are about equal in size, and the sixth is smaller. The number of tines resembles that seen in the Sunda colugo, which has four to seven; the Philippine colugo has three to five. The c1 is also an elongate, narrow tooth; at the front, it is slightly curved towards the midline of the jaw. On the buccal (outer) side of this tooth are six cusps, of which the third (counting from the front) is the largest. The p3 is similarly elongate and rounded at the front, but it is broader at the back, forming a talonid (a \\"heel\\" of cusps at the back of a tribosphenic tooth). There are six cusps on the narrow anterior part of the tooth, and the fifth (identified as the protoconid) is by far the largest. On the buccal side of the talonid is a strong cusp, the hypoconid, with a crest, the cristid obliqua, descending from it towards the front. A second, smaller cusp, the hypoconulid, is present on the lingual side of the talonid, connected to the hypoconid by a postcristid. The pectinate (comb-like) shape of the anterior teeth is a shared characteristic of the colugos and highly unusual among mammals. Dermotherium chimaera resembles the Sunda colugo in that the c1 and p3 are also pectinate; in the Philippine colugo, these teeth are not pectinate. In Dermotherium chimaera, the p4 and m1 through m3 are similar to each other (and unlike the i3, canine, and p3) and appear to form a series of decreasing size from front to back. In D. major, only m2 and m3 are known, but they are similar in morphology and m3 is smaller than m2. In the Sunda colugo, however, the teeth get larger from p4 to m3. The p4 and molars have a distinct trigonid (a triangular group of cusps at the front of a tribosphenic tooth) and talonid. The trigonid contains strong protoconid and metaconid cusps. The metaconid is stronger than the protoconid in the molars, but it is not clear whether this is the case in the p4. In the living colugos, the protoconid is higher than the metaconid in both p4 and m1. The trigonid is longer in the p4 than in the molars. In D. chimaera, the trigonid is broader than in D. major. A low crest, the paracristid, descends from the protoconid lingually and towards the front, forming the front margin of the trigonid; there is no distinct cusp (a paraconid) at the front of the trigonid on the p4, but this cusp is present in the molars. The talonid contains a hypoconid, hypoconulid, and entoconid and is much wider than the trigonid because the hypoconid is displaced buccally. A cristid obliqua descends from the hypoconid and reaches the protoconid. Although a crest, the postmetacristid, descends from the back side of the metaconid, ending in a small cusp, the metastylid, it is separated from the entoconid by a notch. The living colugos lack such a strong postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is near the back lingual margin of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In D. major, this cusp is further to the back than in both D. chimaera and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo. In D. chimaera, a low crest, the post-hypoconulid cristid, reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a small cuspule, the distocuspid, is located. A long crest, the postcristid, connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is similar, but in D. major, both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are absent, and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid. Upper dentition The upper molars of Dermotherium chimaera are triangular in overall shape and much broader than long, with the narrow end of the triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D. chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D. chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone and in front of the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles a U in the Sunda colugo. A cingulum (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D. chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos. Range and ecology Dermotherium major was found in a lignite pit known as Wai Lek in Krabi Province, southwestern Thailand. It is part of the Krabi Basin fauna, which contains at least 40 mammalian genera, mostly artiodactyls but also including some primates, such as Siamopithecus, Wailekia, and Muangthanhinius. This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years ago, during the Late Eocene. Fossils of Dermotherium chimaera come from Phetchaburi Province, further to the north in Thailand. The fossil deposits, located in the Cha Prong pit in a coal mine called Nong Ya Plong, are dated to the Late Oligocene. Other mammals found here include the rodent Fallomus ladakhensis, the rhinoceros Diceratherium sp. cf. D. lamilloquense, the carnivoran Chaprongictis phetchaburiensis, the lipotyphlan Siamosorex debonisi, and a pteropodid bat. Paali Nala, where the M2 tentatively assigned to Dermotherium chimaera was found, is in the Bugti Hills of Balochistan, western Pakistan. The fossil locality, placed stratigraphically in the Bugti Member of the Chitarwata Formation, is thought to be Early Oligocene in age. The Paali Nala fauna also contains a diverse array of mammals, including many rodents, some primates, and rhinos. The specializations of dermopterans are such that they are dependent on a forested habitat, and reconstructions of the paleoenvironments at Krabi, Nong Ya Plong, and Paali Nala suggest that all three fossil deposits developed in a humid, tropical forest environment. Their extinction in the Indian subcontinent may have been caused by the development of a drier climate there during the Late Oligocene.

This was necessary because of other legislation which had been introduced to allow members of the provincial legislatures to cross the floor (move from one party to another) without losing their seats. It came into force on 20 June 2002, and was effectively repealed on 17 April 2009 by the Fourteenth Amendment. Provisions The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) consists of ninety members, ten from each province. Seats in each province's delegation are allocated to parties in proportion to the seats held by the parties in the provincial legislature. Before the passage of the Ninth Amendment, seats in a provincial delegation were only re-allocated when a new provincial legislature was elected, and permanent delegates were appointed for a term that lasted until the next election of the provincial legislature. The Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Act, 2002, which was enacted at the same time as the Ninth Amendment, purported to allow members of the provincial legislatures to cross the floor at certain times without losing their seats. The Ninth Amendment consequently modified the constitution to provide that, if such floor-crossing occurs in a provincial legislature, then the seats in that province's NCOP delegation must be reallocated according to the new makeup of the legislature, and also that permanent delegates' terms of office expire when such a reallocation happens. Legislative history The amendment was introduced to Parliament as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill, part of a package of four bills dealing with floor-crossing. The others were the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Bill, which became the Eighth Amendment, the Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Bill, mentioned above, and the Local Government: Municipal Structures Amendment Bill, which dealt with consequential effects of floor-crossing in municipal councils. The bill was initially passed by the National Assembly on 11 June 2002 with 280 votes in favour, more than the requisite two-thirds majority. It was then passed with amendments by the NCOP on 18 June, with all nine provinces voting in favour. The amendments were approved by the National Assembly on 19 June with 287 votes in favour, and the bill was signed by President Thabo Mbeki on the same day. It came into force on the following day, at the same time as the other three floor-crossing acts. On 4 October 2002, in the case of United Democratic Movement v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others, the Constitutional Court declared the Loss or Retention of Membership Act to be unconstitutional. This judgment had no effect on the Ninth Amendment, which remained in place notwithstanding that there could be no floor-crossing in the provincial legislatures. On 20 March 2003 the Tenth Amendment came into force, constitutionally enabling floor- crossing in national and provincial legislatures. The changes made by the Ninth Amendment were repealed on 17 April 2009 by the Fourteenth Amendment. Formal title The official short title of the amendment is \\"Constitution Ninth Amendment Act of 2002\\". It was originally titled \\"Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, 2002\\" and numbered as Act No. 21 of 2002, but the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005 renamed it and abolished the practice of giving Act numbers to constitutional amendments.

Academic and ministerial career Shortly after ordination in 1834, Drury was recruited by fellow Brown University alumnus and President of Granville Literary and Theological Institution, John Pratt, to teach Latin and Greek. Drury taught there for two years, but he was best known for his abolitionist activism and establishing a station of the Underground Railroad on the Granville campus and working to organize the 1836 Ohio Abolitionist Convention to be held in Granville. In 1836 possibly as fallout from the Granville Riot,The Granville Riot: Granville's Reaction to the 1836 Abolitionist Convention Held at the Bancroft Barn on North Street The Historical Times: Newsletter of the Granville, Ohio, Historical Society Vol. 12 No. 3 (Summer 1998) Download PDF Retrieved on July 17, 2011 Drury accepted a position as a professor of Greek at Cincinnati College where he remained until 1845, except for a year of teaching Latin and Greek at Waterville College in Waterville, Maine during the 1839‚Äì1840 academic year. Beginning in 1845, Drury accepted the first of a series of positions in Covington, Kentucky. Drury was among the first faculty members at the Western Baptist Theological Institute in Covington, where he taught theology. He was also responsible for the classical school attached to the seminary. Drury left the Western Baptist Theological Institute in 1853 to teach and serve as principal at the Covington Public High School that first opened its doors on January 8, 1853. On January 26, 1856, he was named the first Superintendent of the Covington Public School System. Drury's work as superintendent was exemplary, and he was given several raises by the board. These raises, however, violated the charter of the school system (his salary had increased beyond the legal limit imposed by the school charter). In 1859, the members of the board reduced his salary so it would be in compliance with the charter. Drury resigned on the spot. That same year, Drury and a partner opened the Judsonia Female Seminary in the old Western Baptist Theological Institute building (the institute having closed several years earlier in 1855). The Judsonia Seminary did not survive beyond 1861 when the seminary building was used as a hospital during the American Civil War. Beginning with his commissioning as an officer on February 8, 1862, Drury served as chaplain for the 18th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry in the Union Army during the Civil War.Kentucky.

It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The building was constructed in 1914‚Äì1915 from plans submitted by Oregon State Architect William C. Knighton in the American Renaissance style. The building's name was changed in 1918 to honor John Wesley Johnson, the first president of the university. History Johnson Hall, when it was constructed in 1915, was originally designed to house administrative offices and other campus services just like it still does today. Also just like its current day condition, the second floor included the offices of the President, Registrar, Business Manager and all of their related support facilities. All other services were located on the first and basement floors. In its early beginnings, Johnson Hall housed the Guild Theater, major department offices, classrooms and a collections exhibit. At the time when the building was completed the total cost of the project amounted to $103,829.96 making it the most expensive building on campus in 1915. In 1949, renovation removed the Guild Theater whose function was replaced by the \\"New University Theater\\" (Robinson Theater at Villard Hall). The beloved glass panels on the roof of Johnson were dispersed after the renovation. Some sections of the panels were located at the Erb Memorial Union until when in 1998 restoration once again moved the stained glass panels. Today some portions of the glass panels can be seen in the \\"Johnson Hall\\" boardroom while others can be seen in the second story windows of Lawrence Hall. With the late 1960s and early 1970s came the Counterculture and anti-war sentiment. Eugene was flooded with anti-war rallies as students began to take a side against the American conflict in Vietnam. On March 23, 1970 students took to \\"Johnson Hall\\" and held a \\"stay- all-night\\" sit-in. Administration allowed the all night sit-in after talking to the crowd and announcing that as long as the students allowed the administration to return home to their families, they would permit the protestors to remain in the building overnight. The president, however, constantly reminded the students that their occupation of the building was an infraction of the law. According to newspaper reports as many as 200 students spent the night in \\"Johnson Hall\\". The sit-in continued all day Thursday and by that evening there seemed to be no resolution in sight. At that time on Thursday, President Robert Clark informed the protesters that he would not allow them to remain in the building for another night. He also told them that if they did not leave peacefully they would be arrested for trespassing. Clark finally made the decision to call the police. Eugene police backed by lane county sheriff's deputies, entered the building from the front and rear doors. Students did not try and resist them until they were pulled out of the circle they had formed on the floor of the lobby and handcuffed. After this, chaos erupted at the south entrance of the building while a group of protesters were seen staging a sit-down around the police vans. The police reacted quickly and released tear gas clearing a way for the vans. It was at that point the National Guard entered. The crowd of spectators swelled outside \\"Johnson Hall\\" that day to about 700 people after the sit-in was broken up. Many followed the police vans as they made their hurried exit from campus, throwing rocks, trash and anything they could find. The police and national guards intervention resulted in 61 arrests for trespassing and or disorderly conduct that day. Architecture Johnson Hall is of the classically derived American Renaissance style. The style and elevations are unique to the Eugene area. The building itself is composed of brick veneer, terra cotta, and reinforced concrete. Through the years the interior of the building has had some changes done to it but all in all it still retains its original design very well (minus the Guild Theater). When it was first constructed by Knighton in 1915 the building consisted of a four-sided pitched roof with a flat fifth surface in the middle. The middle surface consisted of a large skylight that allowed light in through the center of the building. Contextually within the campus design \\"Johnson Hall\\" works to complete a north/south axis. With its two entrances both being glass doors the design helps to maintain the relationship between the \\"Old Quadrangle\\" and the \\"Woman's Quadrangle\\". Furthermore, the building is contextually significant in the campus' design because being the administration building it is located close to the center of campus. Ellis Lawrence Contribution Ellis F. Lawrence, the University's major architect was involved with parts of the design for Johnson Hall in addition to Knighton. President Prince Lucian Campbell referred to Lawrence as the \\"advisory architect\\" during the construction and even though his contributions were small, Lawrence was said to have had input during the construction of the building at four parts. 1\\\\. He found the location and advised from an outside position on its design with Knighton. 2\\\\. He attempted to improve the acoustics of the Guild Theater with different drapes and floor covering, however no one is sure if this was accomplished or not. 3\\\\. When the hall was named in honor of the University's first president, Johnson in 1918, Lawrence advised against the terra cotta frieze on which \\"Administration Building\\" appeared and instead advocated for using a sign with 6-inch bronze Roman letters over the entrance which read \\"Johnson Hall\\". This sign still remains above the entrance today. 4\\\\. In 1919 Lawrence advised Glenn Stanton from the school of architecture to design the bronze commemorative sign which is also inside the building today. Appearances in media In 1978 \\"Johnson Hall\\" was featured in the American comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House, directed by John Landis. Several scenes were shot inside the Dean's office and outside the building's north entrance.

Parts of Greater St. Louis also support a public transportation network that includes bus and light rail service. Roads and highways Greater St. Louis contains seven Interstates, including four primary routes (I-44, I-55, I-64, and I-70), and three auxiliary routes (I-270, I-170, and I-255). Greater St. Louis also is linked by four U.S. Highways: US 40, US 50, US 61, and US 67\\\\. Interstates Among the primary Interstates, I-70 travels west to east through Warren, St. Charles, and St. Louis counties and the city of St. Louis, leaving Missouri over the newly completed Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge into St. Clair and Madison counties in Illinois. I-55 travels south to north through Jefferson and St. Louis counties and the city of St. Louis, there briefly merging with I-44, then crossing the Poplar Street Bridge with I-64. In East St. Louis, Illinois, I-64 branches off and I-70 joins I-55. The I-55/I-70 concurrency continues into Troy, Illinois in Madison County, with I-55 continuing north toward Chicago. I-44 enters Greater St. Louis at Sullivan in Crawford County, eastward through Franklin and St. Louis counties, merging briefly with I-55 in St. Louis, and terminating at I-70. I-64's western terminus is in Wentzville, Missouri at I-70/US 40/US 61 in St. Charles County, crossing the Daniel Boone Bridge into St. Louis County, entering St. Louis city, and overlapping with I-55 across the Poplar Street Bridge. I-64 then crosses through St. Clair and Clinton counties before exiting the region. The \\"beltway\\" serving Greater St. Louis is the combination of I-270 and I-255, the former a mostly western bypass of St. Louis City. I-270 crosses into Illinois on the northern edge of St. Louis County on the Chain of Rocks Bridge, and continues through Madison County until ending at the I-55/I-70 interchange near Troy, Illinois. In southern St. Louis County, I-270 ends at the I-55 interchange near Mehlville, where the roadway becomes I-255, which continues east across the Mississippi River on the Jefferson Barracks Bridge into Monroe County, where it turns north, traveling through St. Clair County until ending at I-270 in Madison County. Another secondary route is I-170, which is entirely within St. Louis County, traveling southerly from Hazelwood to Richmond Heights. U.S. Highways The Clark Bridge carries U.S. Highway 67 across the Mississippi River Among the U.S. Highways in the region, US 40 parallels or shares an alignment with I-70 in the west, then later with I-64 in St. Charles County; the concurrency continues until merging with I-70 at the Poplar Street Bridge. US 40 continues with I-70 through Madison County. US 50 enters Greater St. Louis near Gerald, eastward through Franklin County; at Union, it meets I-44, both continuing to Sunset Hills in St. Louis County. US 50, eastward, merges with US 61 and US 67 (Lindbergh Boulevard.) The US 50/US 61/US 67 concurrency continues to the I-55/I-255/I-270 interchange, where they follow I-255 across the Mississippi River. US 50 continues east through Monroe County into St. Clair County, traveling concurrently with I-64 into O'Fallon, where US 50 splits, continuing through Clinton County. US 61 enters the region from the south, paralleling I-55 in Jefferson County, continuing to Festus where it travels concurrently with US 67\\\\. US 61/US 67 continues into St. Louis County until reaching the I-55/I-255/I-270 interchange, where US 61/US 67 follow Lindbergh Boulevard. US 61 continues north into Frontenac, where it joins westbound I-64. US 61 continues west through St. Louis County and into St. Charles County, then leaves I-64 in Wentzville and continues north into Lincoln County and beyond. (I-64's western terminus is at this interchange with I-70 and US 40/US 61.) US 67 enters the region northbound in Farmington, where it continues into Festus, traveling concurrently with US 61 and paralleling I-55.

It was built in 1921 as a single-lane bridge across Lost Creek, a tributary of the Middle Fork Willamette River. The bridge was a replacement for a Howe truss design which failed a 1917 inspection by bridge inspector J. W. McArthur. He wrote, \\"An old bridge. Chords badly worm eaten. Downstream chord has been reinforced in middle by a timber bolted on. Wood is but little better than a powder from worm action. All signs indicate a new bridge in from 2 to 4 years.\\" George W. Breeding constructed the present bridge at the same site in 1921 for $3,617, equivalent to $ today. It is also a Howe truss and includes a eastern approach and a western approach. Roadwork in the mid-1970s realigned the road to bypass the bridge, being accessible only to pedestrians afterwards. A dedication ceremony was held November 17, 1986, to reopen the renovated span to vehicle traffic with a load limit. The Parvin Bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Spanish city of Granada, located on the lake, was an important trading centre for much of its early history so it was a prime target for pirates such as Henry Morgan and freebooters like William Walker. History 17th century A map from the book A New Voyage Round the World, published in 1697 by the pirate William Dampier. Lake Nicaragua, then called the Sweet Sea, is the largest freshwater lake in Central America and is connected to the Caribbean Sea by the San Juan River. Due to the destruction of Le√≥n in 1610, by a volcano, the port of Granada became a main centre of commercial activity and was considered the \\"jewel\\" of Spanish colonies in the New World. By 1650 the Golden Age of Piracy had begun in which buccaneers from several races and nations infested the West Indies. The lake is known to have been controlled by pirates as early as 1665 when Henry Morgan led six shallow draft canoes up the San Juan for an attack on Granada. The canoes were twelve metres long and acquired during an attack on Villahermosa, Mexico, after which Morgan's sailing ships were captured by the Spanish. In June Morgan led his band up the river by night while hiding in the day and when they reached the lake the pirates stealthily crossed it and landed outside town. A general assault was then made on Granada and the Spanish were found completely off guard. After the hostilities had ceased Morgan went after the city's treasury of silver and his men set fire to the buildings and sank all of the Spanish boats found in port. The pirates escaped with an estimated 500,000 sterling silver pounds before sailing up the Coco River where Morgan allied himself with the Miskito native Americans who helped in the sacking of several Spanish settlements in the area. Pirates also founded their own towns at the same time, among them Pueblo Viejo and Bluefields, the latter named after the Dutch pirate Abraham Blauvelt. Soon after Morgan left, the pirate Captain Gallardito began operating on Lake Nicaragua and in 1670 he successfully overwhelmed the garrison of Granada. Following that incident the Spanish resorted to fortifying their territory. At one area southeast of Granada the Spanish Army Captain Fernando Francisco de Escobedo began building the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception in 1673 next to a rapid in the San Juan River. The structure, made of stone, was completed in 1675 and it eventually became an important asset in keeping pirates out of the lake, even though it failed in its first test in 1685 when the British buccaneer William Dampier bypassed the fort by landing on Nicaragua's Pacific coast. Dampier then went on to attack Granada after marching overland and he burned the colony down again on September 8. Soon after the city of Leon was attacked and destroyed as well. 18th century The Fortress of the Immaculate Conception in February 2011. Since the founding of British colonies in the West Indies, most notably Jamaica, the constant conflict between England and Spain created a haven for pirates who also served as privateers in war time. Pirates and Miskito Sambu filibusters attacked the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception repeatedly during the 18th century. Perhaps the most famous battle occurred in 1762 during the Seven Years' War. In the 1740s the British had allied themselves with the Miskito Sambus who were a mixed race of African and native American ethnicities, so when war broke out in 1762 the British and the filibusters began raiding Spanish settlements within Nicaragua for slaves, many of whom were shipped to Jamaica. Eventually a force of 2,000 Britons and Sambus sailed up the San Juan in more than fifty boats and canoes where they laid siege to about 100 Spaniards in the fortress on July 26. The garrison commander had died only recently leaving his daughter, the nineteen- year-old Rafaela Herrera and a lieutenant, to lead the defense. Herrera killed the British commander herself on the first day of the battle and for six days afterward the two sides duelled with cannons. Occasionally the British and Sambus would charge forward for a close quarters engagement though they were beaten back every time with heavy losses. A second British expedition was launched in 1780 and it successfully captured the fort. 19th century Rivas on Lake Nicaragua. Filibustering became popular in the 19th century, primarily in Latin America (the term originated from the Spanish word filibustero which meant pirate or buccaneer). Perhaps the most famous filibustering expedition was William Walker's Conquest of Nicaragua in 1855, by which time the country was independent from Spanish rule. A civil war had broken out in 1854 between liberal and conservative forces; the conservatives, or Legitimists, held Granada while the liberals held Leon. Initially Walker had been commissioned by the liberal government of President General Francisco Castell√≥n to bring 300 men to aid in the war against the Legitimihis real intentions were to take over the country, as he had in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico. Walker sailed from San Francisco in May 1855 with sixty men and when he arrived in Nicaragua his small army of filibusters was increased by about 300 Americans and locals, including the pirate Charles Frederick Henningsen. After a series of battles against both the Legitimists and the liberals, Walker established himself as the ruler of Nicaragua and even received recognition from the American President Franklin Pierce. Recognition didn't last long though, when Walker seized property belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company, the United States government withdrew their support. Soon after that the filibusters engaged in a campaign which ended when 4,000 Salvador and Guatemalan troops besieged Granada. Charles Frederick Henningsen was in command of the city at the time and he only had a few hundred men so there was no choice but to retreat to Lake Nicaragua after burning Granada for a final time. When the city was in flames, Henningsen began his retreat on December 14, 1856, leaving behind a message on a lance which read \\"Here was Granada\\". William Walker surrendered to the United States Navy commander Charles Henry Davis in the sloop-of-war on May 1, 1857 and he was later executed for piracy by the government of Honduras.

Founded in 1998, the magazine became online-only publication from October 2016. History The magazine was established in 1998 as XXI, in reference both to the upcoming century, and to Lanata's previous publication P√°gina/12 (21 is 12 with the figures reversed), by Jorge Lanata and colleagues from the television news magazine, D√≠a D: Adolfo Castelo, Olga Gatti, Claudio Mart√≠nez, Jorge Repiso, Ernesto Tenembaum, and Marcelo Zlotogwiazda. The first issue appeared on 16 July 1998. It was advertised as La revista del siglo que viene (\\"The magazine for the century to come\\"). Later, as people would keep calling it \\"siglo veintiuno\\" rather than just veintiuno (\\"Twenty-one,\\") it changed its name to \\"Veintiuno\\". It later appeared as Veintid√≥s (Twenty-two), and from 2000 onward by its current title, meaning twenty-three. Much as Lanata's successful news daily, P√°gina/12, had done, Veintitr√©s adopted a format of bold headlines and graphics, as well as a muck-raking editorial style. Its target audience is the middle and high socioeconomic classes and professionals, government officials, and students. The magazine also became known for its gag gifts, chosen in allusion to the news story of the day. Lanata sold a 75% stake in 2001 to investigative journalist Ernesto Tenenbaum, after which Veintitr√©s was directed by Guillermo Alfieri; Alfieri left the magazine in 2008 to join Lanata's short-lived Cr√≠tica de la Argentina. Veintitr√©s was purchased in 2008 by Sergio Szpolski, who, in turn, sold a 50% stake in Grupo Veintitr√©s (which also published Newsweek Argentina, Tiempo Argentino, among other periodicals, and operates Channel 23) to Mat√≠as Garfunkel in 2011. The media group's broadcasters and publications established themselves as some of the most supportive of Kirchnerism among Argentina's diverse media. In October 2016 the last print edition of Veintitr√©s published, and the magazine was made an online publication.

Bret formed along the southwestern periphery of a weather front north of the Bahamas on July 17. At first, the storm moved little and gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper-level conditions, reaching peak sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). Steering currents in the area subsequently became better established, and Bret turned toward the northeast only to encounter a substantial increase in vertical wind shear. Despite the shear, the storm maintained a well-defined wind circulation for several days, with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center. By July 22, Bret had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours, prompting the National Hurricane Center to discontinue public advisories when it was located about 375 miles (605 km) north of Bermuda. Since Bret remained over the open Atlantic for most of its existence, its effects on land were limited. While moving little, the storm produced inclement weather and widespread cloudiness over much of the north-central Bahamas. Squalls off the eastern coast of Florida generated rough seas along coastlines, injuring a number of people. Although it stayed well offshore, the storm enhanced tropical moisture over Bermuda, causing beneficial rainfall in dry areas. Meteorological history In mid-July, 2011, a broad upper trough dropped southward over the northwest Atlantic, supporting a cold front that extended westward across Bermuda to inland over Georgia. The front produced a large area of light showers to its north, with its westernmost component remaining quasi- stationary over northeastern Florida. On July 16, a surface low developed along the decaying boundary, just off the coast, generating an area of sporadic convection north of the Bahamas. Although a wind circulation was initially absent and surface pressures were relatively high, the low later became better organized under abating shear conditions. At 2100 UTC on July 17, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) declared it a tropical depression, after reconnaissance confirmed the presence of a closed circulation center about 100 mi (160 km) northwest of Great Abaco Island. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Bret just three hours later, owing to a quick increase in winds and deep central convection. Situated along a weakness in the subtropical ridge, Bret drifted very slowly southward during the initial stages of its existence. Though traces of dry air approached it from the west, the cyclone continued to strengthen, as prominent bands of deep thunderstorms tightened around it eastern semicircle. Satellite images displayed a disorganized eye- like feature on July 18, suggesting a rather sharp increase in strength. Indeed, an additional reconnaissance flight into the cyclone found peak surface winds of around 70 mph (110 km/h), just below hurricane strength. Following its peak, Bret began to accelerate toward the northeast in response to building high pressure in the area. It fluctuated little in intensity for several hours, although a combination of high wind shear and a lack of tropical moisture inhibited further development. By July 19, the circulation center had become exposed and devoid of deep convection, and the storm weakened to 50 mph (85 km/h) winds upon moving through the increasingly hostile environment. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Bret retained this intensity for the next couple of days as it briefly slowed, with a distinct low-level circulation and a few patches of persistent thunderstorms over its southwestern quadrant. Early on July 20, the heavily sheared cyclone began to reaccelerate within the deepening southwesterly wind flow. Over the next day, Bret continued to deteriorate in organization; however, a brief decline in the upper winds allowed intermittent bursts of convection to redevelop south of the exposed center. Bret eventually weakened to a tropical depression over cool ocean temperatures early on July 22, once again lacking significant convection while increasing in forward speed. Forecasters at the NHC noted that Bret remained \\"a maverick tropical cyclone by refusing to dissipate despite experiencing very hostile wind shear conditions,\\" with ship data indications of prevailing strong winds. By 1500 UTC, however, the circulation had become ill defined, prompting the NHC to declassify Bret as a tropical system about 375 mi (605 km) north of Bermuda. During the next several hours, the remnant low of Bret continued to move northeastward out into the Atlantic, until it dissipated on July 23. Preparations and impact Bahamas The remnants of Bret passing to the north of Bermuda on July 22 Upon the formation of a depression, the government of the Bahamas issued a tropical storm watch for northwestern islands of the nation. It was upgraded to a tropical storm warning on July 18, when the storm showed signs of intensification. Further south, a severe weather warning was in effect for New Providence and Andros Island, and authorities urged small craft operators to secure their vessels. The warnings were discontinued later that day as Bret turned away from the territory. Since it initially moved little, Bret brought prolonged overcast conditions to much of the northern Bahamas, with most of the activity over the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama. An estimated 3 in (75 mm) of precipitation fell in Abaco over the weekend of July 16-17. In addition, a weather station on the island reported gale-force gusting of up to 48 mph (77 km/h) at the height of the storm. The rain led to the cancellation of a local Little League baseball match. Outer rainbands spawned a waterspout that touched down on eastern Paradise Island, accompanied by lightning strikes and torrents. Nevertheless, locals considered the storm's impact to be generally positive, as its rains aided in alleviating mild drought conditions across the nation. United States and Bermuda Off the coast of Florida, the storm generated rough sea conditions with waves of up to 5 ft (1.9 m); high surf lightly injured several swimmers and surfers in Brevard County. Strong rip currents swept dozens of people out to sea, but all remained unharmed and were quickly rescued. Additionally, the waves washed ashore venomous jellyfish that stung more than 200 people near coastal beaches. Scattered funnel clouds and waterspouts were reported overseas, though the phenomena dissipated soon thereafter without affecting land. Onshore, Bret's effects were minimal; weak morning showers and breezy winds briefly brushed Brevard and Volusia Counties. As the storm lifted out of the area, it drew in a large mass of dry air, limiting chances of much-needed rain to subdue a large wildfire in the Okefenokee Swamp. Light showers from the precursor front skirted Bermuda prior to tropical development, with 24-hour precipitation totals of no more than 0.87 in (22 mm) recorded on the territory. Moisture brought on by the storm from afar enhanced rainfall that ended months of dry conditions in Bermuda; 1.75 in (45 mm) of precipitation fell at L.F. Wade International Airport on July 18, with an additional 1.6 in (40 mm) recorded the next day. Although the rains proved to be mostly beneficial, minor flooding affected some local businesses in poor-drainage areas.

Early life Lawrence was born on December 8, 1905 to George Bertram Lawrence and Della (Chievney) Lawrence. Lawrence attended Medford Public Schools, Northeastern Preparatory School, the Lowell Institute, and Tufts College Engineering School. He worked as a civil engineer prior to entering politics. On June 19, 1930 he married Helen Jones. Early political career From 1934 to 1939, Lawrence was a member of the Medford Board of Aldermen. He was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1939 to 1944. In 1941, Lawrence was a candidate for Mayor of Medford. He narrowly defeated Leland C. Bickford in the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to incumbent John C. Carr 11,500 votes to 11,039. Mayor of Medford Lawrence ran again in 1943. This time he was successful, defeating fellow Representative Michael F. Skerry. During his time as mayor, Lawrence had to deal with shortages from wartime rationing. Because of a shortage of paper, Lawrence requested that citizens separate paper from their other garbage. Any barrels with salvageable paper were not collected by the city. Also during Lawrence's tenure, the City of Medford attempted to control juvenile delinquency by establishing a Youth Commission, creating three new playgrounds, constructing a public swimming pool, and sponsoring activities for boys. Medford was chosen to host the first day of Massachusetts‚Äô week-long celebration of the United States' victory over Japan. As a tribute to the veterans who died in the war, Lawrence oversaw the construction of Memorial Stadium and a memorial tablet in Barry Park. In 1945, the Board of Aldermen chose not to give the job of Fire Chief to Acting Chief John Plante, as he ranked below two World War I veterans on the civil service list. Instead of giving the job to one of the other two men, Lawrence used a clause in the city charter to appoint himself to the position and name Plante as his assistant. This allowed Plante to remain as acting chief. In 1948, the civil service list was reissued and Plante once again fell behind John J. E. Gorham, whom Lawrence named chief on February 10, 1948. In 1948, Lawrence challenged Angier Goodwin for the Republican nomination for Goodwin's seat in the United States House of Representatives. He lost to the incumbent 12,709 votes to 10,579. In 1949, Medford switched to a Plan E form of Government, which meant that the Mayor would no longer be popularly elected, but instead chosen by the City Council. On December 1, 1949, Alderman Frederick T. McDermott was chosen by the Board to become the city's first Mayor under the new form of government, ending Lawrence's tenure as Mayor. In 1950, Lawrence ran for Sheriff of Middlesex County. He finished second out of seven candidates in the Republican primary. In 1951, Lawrence was elected to Medford's first City Council. Town Manager On May 2, 1952, Lawrence was named Town Manager of Saugus, Massachusetts. In 1953 he sold the land opposite Saugus High School to developers for the construction of the New England Shopping Center (which was later redeveloped into the Square One Mall). On January 31, 1956, the Board of Selectmen passed a preliminary resolution to hold a vote to remove Lawrence from office on March 3, 1956, as they no longer had confidence in him as town manager, they had been informed that he no longer wanted to serve as town manager, and the interests of the town would be best served by removing him from office. On February 3, 1956, Lawrence filed an injunction in Essex Superior Court that would prevent the Selectmen from removing him from office and prevent Charles C. DeFronzo from becoming temporary manager. Lawrence claimed that the Selectmen did not follow the proper procedure for removing him because they did not \\"detail the specific reasons for his proposed removal\\". The case was dismissed and a year later the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the lower court's decision. In 1960, Lawrence was appointed Town Manager of Provincetown, Massachusetts. That August he made a request to the state government to provide financial aid to help fight the infiltration of Beatniks into the town. On July 15, 1964, Lawrence left his post in Provincetown to become city manager of Haverhill, Massachusetts. During his time in Haverhill, Lawrence clashed with the school committee over the school department's budget, fought against excess sick leave by city employees, and allowed Amesbury High School to hold classes in the former Haverhill High School building while Amesbury's building was under construction. In March 1967, Lawrence was hospitalized and Public Works Commissioner James Ginty was named acting manager. On April 9, 1967, Lawrence died following a long illness.

Over the next 12 days, the disturbance remained weak while it gradually moved towards the southwest before it started to rapidly develop on January 2, 1998 while it was located near the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. The disturbance was declared a tropical cyclone later that day, but was not named Susan until the next day, after it had intensified into a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Over the next few days, Susan moved towards the southwest and continued to intensify before it reached its peak intensity as a category five tropical cyclone during January 5 while it was located about to the northwest of Vanuatu's capital city Port Vila. At this stage as the cyclone was moving towards the southwest it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards the southeast and subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale-force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600 UTC the next day and starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale-force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. These islands included Viti Levu where a possible tornado destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with. Meteorological history On December 20, 1997, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS), started to monitor a weak tropical disturbance that was located about , to the northwest of Pago-Pago in American Samoa. Over the next two weeks the system gradually moved towards the west-southwest, without developing into a tropical cyclone. During January 2, a mid-level ridge of high pressure developed between Fiji and Vanuatu, which provided an area of low vertical wind shear. The system subsequently started to show signs of significant development, before early on January 3, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated warnings on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 11P. The FMS subsequently reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone, on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, while located near the Fiji dependency of Rotuma. During that day the system continued to rapidly develop with the FMS reporting early on January 4, that Susan had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 120 km/h (75 mph). During January 4, Susan continued to rapidly intensify with the JTWC reporting that Susan had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as convection surrounding the system organized further and developed an eye feature. Cyclone Susan absorbing Cyclone Ron As the ridge of high pressure that was located to the south of the cyclone started to weaken, which meant that Susan started to move further towards the southwest. The FMS then reported at 0000 UTC on January 5, that the system had become a category 5 severe tropical cyclone with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 140 mph (220 km/h), before reporting 6 hours later that Susan had reached its peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 145 mph (225 km/h) and a peak pressure of 900 hPa (26.58 inHg). Around this time, the FMS suggested that the system might have developed a double eye feature, while the JTWC reported that Susan had peaked with 1-minute wind speeds of 260 km/h (160 mph) equivalent to a weak category five hurricane on the SSHS. As the system reached its peak intensity, Susan was moving towards the southwest and as a result, it \\"posed a severe threat to Vanuatu,\\" however during that afternoon, Susan recurved towards the southeast \\"just in time to spare Vanuatu, a direct hit.‚Äù After turning away from Vanuatu, Susan accelerated towards the southeast while remaining near or at its peak intensities, before starting to weaken significantly during January 7. The FMS then reported early the next day, that Susan had weakened into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone while it was located about , to the southeast of Nadi, Fiji, which was close enough for the system to produce gale-force winds in several southern and western Fijian Islands. By 0000 UTC on January 9, Susan had completely absorbed Cyclone Ron, before the final advisories on the combined system, were released later that day as it lost its tropical characteristics and became extratropical. The remnants of the combined system were monitored for another day, until they were last noted bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Effects Cyclone Susan caused one death and at least worth of damage, when it affected the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji during January 1998. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Susan was retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names for the South Pacific. Between January 2‚Äì5, the system impacted the Solomon Islands Temotu province, where it caused damage to several food gardens and destroyed several houses. Ahead of the system impacting Vanuatu, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Council issued various tropical cyclone alerts to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the Maewo, Pentecost and Ambae islands. Because of the upcoming cyclone the national radio station extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5‚Äì6. Vanautu's domestic airline Vanair closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between Santo Island and Port Vila the capital city of Vanuatu. All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan. However, during January 7, Susan moved south-eastwards and the Fijian islands and spared Vanuatu a direct hit. Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale-force winds caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan Islands, including on Ambrym Island, where a woman died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with. After the alerts were cancelled on January 7, by the National Disaster Management Council, most shops and government buildings on Efate island kept their shutters up because Cyclone Katrina was predicted to directly affect the archipelago within a few days. Late on January 6, the FMS issued a tropical cyclone alert for Fiji, while Susan was located about to the west of Nadi, Fiji. The alert stated that Susan, was expected to pass as close as to the southwest of Viti Levu during the next day. They also warned that there was a chance that the cyclone would curve more towards the east- southeast and bring gale force or stronger winds over Fiji. Early the next day as squally strong north to north-easterly winds were starting to affect Fiji, the FMS upgraded the alert to a gale warning for Vatulele, Kadavu, western and south-western Viti Levu and the Yasawa and Mamanuca island groups. The system subsequently passed close enough to Fiji, to cause some minor coastal damage to several southern and western Fijian islands, including on the main island of Viti Levu. The cyclone also brought with it some beneficial rainfall which helped to ease the drought conditions that were present in Fiji. However, gale-force winds, high seas, a heavy swell and storm surge inundated Bequ Island and a village on Kadavu Island, while partly destroying beach-fronts, roads, jetties and bridges within the archipelago. Within Lautoka several shops, power lines, a bus station and the roof of a shopping complex were damaged after what was believed to be either a tornado or tornadic winds developed in one of Susan's rainbands as it crossed the shoreline. Firemen and linesmen from the Fiji Electricity Authority, were called in to assist police to clear downed power wires.

Legislative history Parliament had previously attempted to allow floor-crossing by passing the Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial Legislatures Act, 2002, an ordinary act rather than a constitutional amendment. On 4 October 2002, in the case of United Democratic Movement v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others, the Constitutional Court declared it to be unconstitutional. A week later a draft of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Fourth Amendment Bill was published. The bill was passed by the National Assembly on 25 February 2003 with 300 votes in favour, more than the required two-thirds majority. It was then passed by the National Council of Provinces on 18 March, with all nine provinces voting in favour. It was signed by President Thabo Mbeki on 19 March, and came into force on the following day. The changes made by the Tenth Amendment were repealed on 17 April 2009 by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Formal title The official short title of the amendment is \\"Constitution Tenth Amendment Act of 2003\\". It was originally titled \\"Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, 2003\\" and numbered as Act No. 2 of 2003, but the Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005 renamed it and abolished the practice of giving Act numbers to constitutional amendments.

Valentine was an umpire in the 1965 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In his career, he umpired 947 Major League games.Retrosheet Early life Valentine was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, to William Valentine Sr., a railroad worker, and Margaret Kremer Valentine. Valentine grew up a short distance from Travelers Field, the home stadium of the Arkansas Travelers minor league team. Valentine worked odd jobs at the stadium, including sorting soft drink bottles before games, retrieving seat cushions after games, and shagging foul balls and returning them during games. Valentine began umpiring in amateur and semi-pro games as a teenager. Valentine graduated from North Little Rock High School in 1950, and received a scholarship from the Arkansas State Teachers College to study journalism. However, Valentine continued to umpire, and in 1951 he attended Bill McGowan's umpiring school in West Palm Beach, Florida. He received an offer to umpire in the Class D Ohio‚ÄìIndiana League, and became the youngest professional umpire in baseball history, at the age of 18. Career Valentine spent several years in the lower minors, but was promoted to the Double-A Texas League in 1954. After seven seasons in the Texas League, Valentine was promoted to the Pacific Coast League in 1960, and was hired to the American League staff two seasons later in 1963. Valentine spent six years as an AL umpire, and was chosen as an umpire for the 1965 All-Star Game at Metropolitan Stadium. A few days after the All-Star game, in the same ballpark, Valentine got into an argument with Minnesota Twins manager Sam Mele, in which Mele appeared to throw a punch at Valentine. Mele was suspended five games for his actions. Valentine was also the home plate umpire when Tony Conigliaro was hit by a pitched ball at Fenway Park on August 18, 1967. Firing On September 16, 1968, Valentine received a call from American League president Joe Cronin, informing Valentine that he and fellow umpire Al Salerno were being fired, effective immediately. Cronin told Valentine and the press that he was fired for being a poor umpire. However, Valentine and Salerno had in fact been working to form a union of American League umpires, who were receiving a lower salary than the National League umpires, who were unionized. After the 1968 season, Valentine and Salerno filed a $4 million lawsuit against the American League and Major League Baseball, alleging federal antitrust violations and defamation of character. In addition, the newly formed Major League Umpires Association filed an unfair-labor-practice claim with the National Labor Relations Board. However, Valentine and Salerno lost both cases. In 1970, as a settlement, the American League offered the umpires full reinstatement, back pay, and $20,000 in salary, but Salerno refused the deal because of a provision that stated that the umpires would have to spend time in the minor leagues to improve their skills. After umpiring Salerno's refusal of the settlement ended his and Valentine's careers, and Valentine returned to Little Rock. He worked as a referee for basketball games. He was for a time the executive director of the Arkansas Republican Party, a position originally held from 1970 to 1973 by Neal Sox Johnson. Valentine worked as an announcer for the Arkansas Travelers for eight years. In 1976, Valentine became general manager of the Travelers. In his first season as general manager, the team saw a 34 percent increase in attendance, due in part to Valentine's stunts including giving away tens of thousands of tickets to kids, hoping they would bring their parents to the game with them, and holding midget wrestling and amateur boxing at the stadium. The Travelers' attendance continued to increase over the years, and also saw on-field success, winning five league titles while Valentine was GM. Valentine was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame, the Arkansas Officials Association Hall of Fame, the Texas League Hall of Fame, and the North Little Rock Boys Club Hall of Fame. Valentine stepped down as general manager in 2007 after thirty-one years. He remained executive vice president for two more seasons before retiring in March 2009. He died on April 26, 2015 in Little Rock, Arkansas.

Development Introduction and characterization On July 31, 2008, Melanie is introduced as a sharp-tongued, quick-witted party girl who was well known for seducing men. Upon her debut, she is revealed as the daughter of Jane Layton and Trent Robbins, who is also the father of her half-brother Max Brady. After finding a picture of a young girl that belongs to Trent, it is revealed that Melanie is Max Brady's sister. Max travels to Paris, France (where Melanie lives) and pays Melanie's debt to a man named Les. Quickly upon her introduction, Melanie reveals she has criminal tendencies; using a wealthy French man to drain his bank account, stealing a teacher's wallet during grade school and a diamond bracelet from her friend, Tiffany. She quickly makes an enemies with Max's girlfriend Stephanie Johnson, who doesn't find Melanie's party girl attitude endearing. After being released on bail and leaving Max behind, Melanie meets Nick Fallon, Max's friend and business partner, where the two instantly hit it off. Melanie convinces Tiffany to drop the charges against Max and Stephanie, with Max taking her on a date. Melanie soon moves to Salem after her brother returns to the United States. After moving to Salem, Trent uses Melanie to have a drink with a man who wants more out of Melanie. Nick rushes to her aid where he is shot and hospitalized. Trent is murdered and Nick is revealed as the killer. Biological family reveal After turning in Nick Fallon for the murder of her father, Nick signs over his share of the alternative fuel project to Melanie, allowing her to get a job at Titan, and meeting Philip Kiriakis, whom she develops a crush on. However, because he was her boss, she causally begins dating Nathan Horton. Melanie, unaware of Nathan's deep feelings for her, engages Phillip, who is dating Stephanie Johnson, causing a rivalry with Stephanie. When Melanie sells the project Nick developed to Tony DiMera, Stephanie is kidnapped causing Melanie to help Phillip save Stephanie. However, the two break up despite Melanie's attempts to keep them together. Stephanie flirts with Nathan during their date, causing Melanie to leave. She finds Philip and the two sleep together and soon after begin a relationship. Eventually Philip proposes to Melanie. It was revealed on-screen that Melanie is in fact the long-lost daughter of Dr. Daniel Jonas and Carly Manning in which she was conceived in an affair causing Carly's husband Lawrence Alamain to give her up for adoption. The reveal surfaced when Vivian Alamain returns to Salem to wreak revenge on Carly for murdering Lawrence; learning that Carly has a biological daughter. Vivian plots to kill Melanie in order to hurt Carly as revenge for Lawrence's death. After failed attempts by Vivian, Melanie is accidentally shot by Carly when she attempts to stop Vivian from hurting Melanie. Melanie eventually wakes up from her coma when Vivian attempts to suffocate her with a pillow. Upon learning about her biological parents, Melanie is initially furious with Carly and bonds with Daniel. Relationships In 2011, Melanie was involved in a storyline in which she would fall in love with her best friend Abigail Deveraux's (Kate Mansi) boyfriend Chad DiMera (Casey Jon Deidrick). Speaking of this during an interview with Michael Fairman, Burnett talked about her admiration of the normality of the storyline, stating: \\"How many girls have fallen in love with their best friend's significant other? It totally happens\\".Michael Fairman Chats to Molly Burnett and Shawn Christian In an interview with Daytime Confidential, Burnett talked about Melanie and Brady Black's friendship, which Jamey Giddens said could have been a romance, stating: \\"I love what Melanie and Brady had. I think they were a really authentic team. There was such a genuine admiration and friendship there. It would have been a kind of story that maybe way down the line, any romantic relationship that could have blossomed would have been a real one.\\" Storylines Melanie was first found by her half-brother Max Brady, and she was baffled when she found out that she had a brother living in Salem. Melanie followed Max back to Salem, and eventually moved to town. Trent, who is generally hated by all in town, was murdered; Melanie was the main suspect. She confessed to having a serious fight with him the night of the murder, but had maintained her cool and wouldn't have even attempted to kill him. It was later revealed that Nick Fallon, a friend of hers (he was in love with Melanie, but she wasn't interested in him) had killed Trent, due to problems with an alternative fuel project at the university. Melanie inherited her father's goods. Initially Melanie had encouraged Nick to continue his work with the fuel project so they could sell it in order to attain money and not turn himself in for the murder; however, when Nick became too obsessed with Melanie and even proposed to her at one stage, she turned him in herself to avoid him. Nick was sent to jail. He signed over his share of the fuel project to Melanie, allowing her to get a job at Titan, and she developed a crush on Philip Kiriakis, her boss at the time; however she casually was dating Nathan Horton. She had a rivalry with Stephanie Johnson, Phillip's then girlfriend (who had previously dated Max, and Melanie hated her then too). Nathan and Melanie both worked at the Salem Hospital together, and he developed deep feelings for her. Melanie chose to engage Phillip, unaware of Nathan's true feelings. Melanie was both elated and confused to learn that Daniel Jonas (a doctor at the hospital) was her father, and later it was revealed that Carly Manning was her mother (she was conceived during an affair they had many years ago) and that Trent wasn't even blood-related to her. Melanie developed a deep friendship with Maggie Horton, whom she viewed as a mother. She became instantly well acquainted to her new parents. Nathan and Melanie kissed and fell in love during her engagement, however they were never physical. They planned to run away before her marriage to Phillip, but she stayed true to her commitments. On the day of her wedding, her mother's stalker (who was seeking revenge on Carly for killing her husband, who was Vivian's son, in self- defense) Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) (who had befriended and manipulated Melanie to kill her to get revenge on Carly) poisoned her comb. She was fine, and Vivian's plans to allow Carly to watch her daughter die failed. However, Carly, shot Vivian but Melanie jumped in the way (protecting Vivian who she assumed was on her side). Melanie slipped into a brief coma. Vivian tries to kill Melanie in the hospital, and Melanie tells Vivian her life story, which touches Vivian who relents. Melanie and Phillip are married and Vivian shifts her attention from Melanie to Carly. When Phillip sees Melanie and Nathan together (they were not physical, just passionately holding each other) he goes to his former flame and Daniel, Melanie's father's fianc√©e, Chloe Lane and they have sex. It was later revealed that Chloe was pregnant. She went through her pregnancy with knowledge that the baby had two possible fathers. After the child is born, Phillip is revealed as the father. Melanie left him and ended their marriage, despite briefly tricking him into thinking she loved him to take away his and Chloe's baby, Parker, with encouragement from his own mother, Kate DiMera who despised Chloe. She is pregnant with Phillip's child, but loses the baby during an altercation with Stephanie. She briefly dates Nathan, however he leaves, thinking they can never be together due to the hassle already caused. Melanie dates Dario, Rafe Hernandez's brother, who leaves town, devastating Melanie. Melanie kisses her best friend Abigail Deveraux's boyfriend, Chad DiMera. The two have a fling which upsets Abigail. Later after Abigail has moved on, Gabi Hernandez develops feelings for Chad as well. In order to get Chad all to herself Gabi hires a man to kidnap Melanie, who takes her down into the DiMera tunnels causing an explosion that almost killed Jack Deveraux, because of the experience Melanie leaves town in 2012, to join her mother Carly in Europe. In 2014, Melanie returns to Salem after getting into some trouble in Europe. She develops a relationship with Brady Black and the two get engaged, but when Theresa Donavan threatens Melanie to not allow Brady to see his son Tate unless she leaves town, she breaks off the engagement and exits the show once again in 2015. She comes back for a quick visit in January 2016, for her father Daniel Jonas' funeral. Reception Initially the character was negatively received by fans; Burnett cited that in her first public appearance she was heavily booed by the audience. However, when she departed four years later, it was negatively received by fans. For her work on Days of our Lives as Melanie, Burnett was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in both 2010 and 2012.

The flight was operated by Executive Airlines, doing business as American Eagle, and was operated by a CASA C-212 Aviocar aircraft. Visual meteorological conditions were present as the plane made its final approach to runway 9 at Mayag√ºez on May 8, 1987. The plane crashed 600 feet short of the runway, destroying the aircraft and killing both pilots, but leaving the four passengers with only minor injuries. Accident Flight 5452 took off five minutes late, at 6:20 am, from San Juan with four passengers aboard. Half an hour later, as the flight was landing, witnesses reported hearing the engine make irregular sounds, and then observed the plane bank to the left and impact the ground. It was initially reported that the pilot lost control while landing. The plane crashed short of the runway and slammed into the airport perimeter fence. After the crash, a fire broke out, which was contained within minutes by airport firefighters. Aircraft The aircraft, a CASA C-212~C registered N432CA, was put into service with Executive Airlines in October 1986 after it was purchased from Prinair. As a result of the impact of the crash and subsequent fire, the aircraft was destroyed. The aircraft involved in the crash had prior maintenance troubles related to engine torque. In fact, just a day before the accident, issues with the propeller blade angle were addressed by Executive's maintenance department. Crew The captain, Franklin Rivera Velez, 44, held an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) certificate. He had 20 years of pilot experience, with about 10,000 hours of total flying time. He had accumulated about 5,000 hours of turbine engine airplane experience, 4,500 hours of which were in the deHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter, and 473 hours of which were in the CASA C-212. The first officer, Reynold E. Santiaqo Cordero, 32, also held an ATP certificate. He had 10 years of pilot experience, with about 4,473 hours of total pilot time, 459 hours of which were in the CASA C-212. He was not type rated in the CASA C-212.  Investigation  Early similarities were drawn between Flight 5452 and that of Northwest Airlink Flight 2268, another CASA C-212 which crashed in Detroit earlier that year. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated. The investigation was hindered by the lack of flight data or voice recorders, which were not required on commuter aircraft at the time, and by lack of radar data, as the Mayag√ºez control tower had been shut down by the Federal Aviation Administration due to budgetary constraints. Airport facilities, however, were not a factor in the crash. The NTSB determined early on that the captain had flown an unstable approach, descending steeply and too close to the runway. As a result, the captain would not have had sufficient time to correct problems as they arose. Furthermore, the plane's flaps were found to be in the up position, which is improper procedure. The NTSB could only speculate that either the pilots forgot to set the flaps, or that they incorrectly retracted the flaps while attempting to go-around. The flap- setting error could have contributed to a stall. Ultimately, the cause of the crash was not blamed on pilot error, although that was a contributing factor, but rather on maintenance issues at Executive Airlines. Pilots on prior flights flying the accident aircraft had reported difficulties with the engine thrust, but few proper repairs were done. It seemed likely that one of the engines slipped to idle, causing asymmetrical thrust and a loss of speed. The NTSB concluded that Executive Airlines' scheduled maintenance and inspections of the airplane were not performed in conformance with its approved maintenance program, and that the manner in which required inspections of maintenance tasks were recorded and the subsequent approval of the airplane for return to service were not conducted in accordance with the proper maintenance practices.

Elements of the rebellion continued continued sporadically until 1903. Background French diplomatic and military claims over the island of Madagascar - ongoing for more than four decades - intensified under the reigns of Queen Ranavalona II and Queen Ranavalona III, the island's final monarchs.Oliver, Samuel. Madagascar: An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Island and its Former Dependencies, Volume 1. Macmillan and Co., 1886. Following a successful campaign under General Jacques Duchesne, France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French declared Madagascar to be their colony and exiled Malagasy Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in Algeria) where he died the following year. Queen Ranavalona III and much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. A civil governor, Hippolyte Laroche, was initially appointed to administer the territory. Outbreak Execution of Rainandriamampandry and Ratsimamanga, Madagascar, 1896 (impa-m28578) In December 1895, two months after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular resistance to French rule emerged in the form of the menalamba (\\"red shawl\\") uprising, principally conducted by common peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red laterite soil of the highlands. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity, and political corruption, quickly spread throughout the island. The rebellion did not seek to restore the authority of the queen, as the conversion of the leading members of the royal family was regarded by the rebels as the cause of cosmic chaos. The rebellion was based in peripheral regions far from the capital, already the abode of brigands, runaway slaves and deserters. One if its main motivations was the restoration of traditional ancestor veneration. Another was the rejection of corvee labour (fanompoana), on which had become increasingly common in the Malagasy political order and which the church promoted and relied on. The rebellion broke out only a few days after the French took Antananarivo. It began spontaneously in multiple centres and lacked any unified leadership or coordination. Lacking central coordination, as the revolt developed it encompassed both religious traditionalists and popular Christian preachers, and although it rejected the corrupt old political order, it maintained links with the palace. it also involved both Merina people and members of other ethnic groups. The scale and danger of the rebellion was not immediately obvious to the French, who at first they were only dealing with isolated outbreaks of violence. However in March 1896 a full-scale uprising began, taking them by surprise. The indication that something different was happening was a wave of coordinated attacks on administrative posts of the Malagasy royal government in that month. Members of Ranavalona's court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen's uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her Minister of War, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen's aunt, was exiled to Reunion because the French were reluctant to execute a woman. The resistance led the government of France to replace the island's civil governor with a military governor, General Joseph Gallieni. It was also a principal factor in the decision to exile Ranavalona to R√©union later that same year. The height of the rebellion Lyautey in Madagascar, 1898 At its height, the rebellion may have controlled territory with as many as 300,000 people. The rebels were able to impose a blockade on Antananarivo in July, August and September of 1896, and in the latter month a state of siege was declared in the capital. There was a belief among some of the rebels - particularly Protestants, that the British would arrive to support them against the French. However this hoped for support never materialised and by 1897 hunger was forcing rebel groups to negotiate for surrender. One, in the north of the country, led by Rabezavana, surrendered to Hubert Lyautey in May 1897. Suppression Jacques Berthieu (1838-1896) The resistance movement was mostly put down by the French military by 1900, although revolts continued in west, northwest and east Madagascar until 1903. The rebellion destroyed hundreds of churches and killed an unknown number of Malagasy religious figures as well as five foreign missionaries. Jacques Berthieu, a Jesuit priest executed by the rebellion, was declared a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church in 2012. The number of Malagasy deaths as a result of the rebellion may have 100,000, while French deaths - from disease as well as violent causes - were in the hundreds.

Cromwell has gained financial backing for the tribe's casino development effort from the Malaysian billionaire Lim Goh Tong and his Kien Huat Realty arm of the Genting Group. The chairman hired the former U.S. representative Bill Delahunt to lobby on behalf of the tribe.Former Congressman Bill Delahunt to represent Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, Indian Country Today, March 12, 2011. Because the Wampanoag have long been without a reservation, Cromwell is committed to securing federal lands in trust for the tribe. Under state and federal gaming laws, such land is necessary as a sovereign base for the tribal plan to establish a gaming casino resort, with plans to include hotels, restaurants, slot parlors and retail shopping. The previous council chair Glenn Marshall had similar proposals for a Mashpee Wampanoag land-in-trust reservation, including the establishment of an international free-trade zone and Indian wholesale banking operations independent from state and federal regulators.Glenn Marshall editorial board interview, Standard-Times, 28 August 2007 Cromwell has traveled to Washington, DC, to lobby on Native American issues. He supports the Native CLASS Act to improve education of Native children, and the equal treatment of all Indian tribes by the federal government. He testified before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. He is working to gain Congressional approval for legislation to enable the Wampanoag to acquire land for the government to hold in trust. But the US Supreme Court decision in Carcieri v. Salazar (2012) ruled that tribes not under federal jurisdiction in 1934 could not acquire land that could be classified as trust land by the Department of Interior. Any land they acquired would be treated in common with other privately held land.

Its logo is based on the logo for the New York Central Railroad. Its main feature is a gauge miniature railway, which closely corresponds to a 1:4 scale model of a standard gauge railroad. History TrainTown was founded by Stanley L. Frank of Oakland, California. In 1958 he \\"began bringing his dream railroad to life, building everything himself, from the houses and landscaping to the line's two steam locomotives and one electric engine.\\" The railroad opened to the public in 1968. Frank died in 1977, and his son Robert Frank has continued to run the day to day operations of TrainTown alongside his wife Barbara and his daughter Monica. TrainTown also features a beautiful carousel, a mine train roller coaster, and an airplane ride. The petting zoo includes many animals, some of whom are rescues, such as goats, chickens, ducks, llamas, sheep, and bunnies. Descriptions Called \\"an endearing and surprising modern tribute to trains\\", TrainTown is \\"an obsessively accurate model railroad\\". It has been described as \\"the most well-developed miniature railroad\\" in the Americas. It operates in \\"a wooded 10-acre park on a 20-minute ride past waterfalls and beautifully detailed houses, over a trestle and through several tunnels, all precisely one-quarter the size of the real thing.\\" It carries up to 90 passengers on each ride, and includes four miles of track. TrainTown features an operating replica of a New York Central Hudson locomotive, but numbered 5212, which no New York Central steam locomotive was ever numbered. This is considered by some to be the \\"most beautiful steam locomotive of the 1930s\\". A travel writer said that \\"the whole layout is so cleverly crafted that it's a marvel of dedication to the art of the train buff\\". In 2009, steam locomotive 4-6-4 Hudson, number 6088, arrived at Sonoma TrainTown. It was built in the 1980s and originally ran on the gauge Goleta Valley Railroad.

Chipping Norton is located approximately 75 miles from London. The group gained notoriety in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal, which directly involved members of the group. The core members of the group have been directly involved in the News International phone hacking scandal. Several members of the set, and attendees of their social functions, have been victims of phone hacking by the News of the World. The term \\"Chipping Norton set\\" was included in the 19th edition of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, published in 2012. Members In 2012, The Daily Telegraph identified the following people as being part of a \\"Chipping Norton Set\\": *Racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and Rebekah Brooks (n√©e Wade), former CEO of News International, editor of The Sun and News of the World. Charlie was introduced to Rebekah by Jeremy Clarkson. The Brookses have holidayed with Elisabeth Murdoch and Matthew Freud on their yacht, and the Oppenheimer-Turners at their house in St Tropez. Rebekah Brooks has been friends with Elisabeth Murdoch for more than a decade. In 2001, she was a guest at Elisabeth's wedding to Freud and among a select group invited to her bridal shower. The Brookses live in Sarsden, Oxfordshire, four miles from Chipping Norton. A September 2012 interview with Charlie Brooks was headlined \\"Founder member of the Chipping Norton Upset\\", Brooks explained that the \\"Upset\\" is a family in-joke, in response to the claim that he and his wife are part of the Chipping Norton set, which he called \\"a figment of one journalist's imagination\\". *David and Samantha Cameron. Chipping Norton lies in the constituency of Witney, for which David Cameron, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and the former leader of the Conservative Party, was the Member of Parliament. Cameron's home is in Dean. *Jeremy Clarkson, broadcaster and journalist, then presenter of Top Gear.

Notable gatherings Brookses' wedding reception The guestlist for Rebekah and Charlie Brooks' wedding reception near Chipping Norton in 2009 was described by The Guardian as a \\"powerlist.\\" Guests included Prime Minister Gordon Brown, leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron, and the CEO of News Corporation Rupert Murdoch. Rebekah Brooks was the editor of The Sun at the time of her marriage. The couple repeated their vows in a lakeside ceremony in front of 240 guests, who included Jeremy Clarkson‚Äîat whose house the couple met, Will Lewis, Charles Dunstone, Dow Jones chief executive Les Hinton; and Rupert Murdoch's children James, Elisabeth, and her husband Matthew Freud. 2010 Christmas dinner On 23 December 2010, James Murdoch and Prime Minister David Cameron were guests at a dinner at the home of Rebekah and Charlie Brooks. Brooks was by then chief executive of News International (a subsidiary of News Corporation), and Murdoch was chairman of BSkyB in which News Corporation has a controlling minority stake. The meal took place two days after Cameron had been forced to replace the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, as the minister scrutinising News Corporation's bid for BSkyB. Until April 2012 Cameron had refused to issue an outright denial that he spoke about BSkyB during the dinner with Murdoch in 2010. Murdoch confirmed that they had discussed the bid at the dinner in his testimony to the Leveson Inquiry in April 2012. James Murdoch said he sought assurances at the meal that Jeremy Hunt, who took over Cable's brief, would be more \\"objective\\", Cable had told undercover Daily Telegraph reporters he had \\"declared war on Mr Murdoch.\\" Cable was referring to James Murdoch's father, Rupert. Cameron was accused in 2011 of breaking Parliament's ministerial code of conduct by failing to avoid a possible conflict of interest in attending the Christmas dinner, but he refused to allow an inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Gus O'Donnell. Cameron declared in Parliament that he had \\"never had one inappropriate conversation\\" and that he \\"completely took myself out of any decision-making about this bid\\". A spokesman later said that Cameron had \\"not been involved in any of the discussions about BSkyB.\\" James Murdoch has met Cameron twice since he became Prime Minister, at the Christmas dinner at the Brooks' and a lunch at Chequers in November 2010. Before Murdoch's testimony in April 2012 fellow dinner guest Jeremy Clarkson claimed in July 2011 that Murdoch could not have discussed the BSkyB with Cameron as the Prime Minister and Rebekah Brooks had spent the entire evening discussing sausage rolls. In her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry Rebekah Brooks stated that she and Cameron had attended a second party a few days later on Boxing Day, at her sister-in-law's house. 'Horsegate' A horse, Raisa, was loaned to Rebekah Brooks by the Metropolitan Police from 2008‚Äì2010, stabled at the Brooks' farm and was subsequently returned to the police in a \\"poor condition.\\" In March 2012, David Cameron confirmed that he had ridden the horse with Charlie Brooks before he became Prime Minister in 2010. Cameron had previously stated that he had not. The leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband said that Cameron was in danger of becoming a symbol of \\"how leading politicians get too close to the powerful media.\\" Cameron apologised for a \\"confusing picture\\" to emerge over his connection to Raisa. Cameron said that he was sorry to hear that Raisa \\"is no longer with us...I think I should probably conclude by saying I don't think I will be getting back into the saddle any time soon.\\" On Charlie Brooks, Cameron had earlier told 5 News, \\"He is a friend of mine of 30 years' standing and a neighbour in my constituency, so that's a matter of record. But since I have been prime minister I think I have been on a horse once, and it wasn't that one.\\" Before Cameron confirmed that he had ridden the horse, Jeremy Clarkson said of the affair that \\"I can categorically state that he never rode that horse. I do actually live there. It's all rubbish.\\" Commentary Nick Cohen wrote in the Observer in May 2012 that \\"The non-Murdoch press will not shirk our duty to recall the fabulous social whirl that was once the \\"Chipping Norton Set.\\" We will remind you of how Brooks, Elisabeth Murdoch and Matthew Freud slapped and scratched the backs of David and Samantha Cameron at country homes, while Jeremy Clarkson flitted in and out of their parties ‚Äì gambolling through the Cotswolds like a portly court fool.\\" Peter Oborne described the Chipping Norton set as \\"an incestuous collection of louche, affluent, power- hungry and amoral Londoners\\", while Christina Odone said that \\"Chipping Norton remains a state of mind. It‚Äôs where the stars of Westminster and White City can be machos of the manor, shooting, riding and drinking...Top Londoners who can afford the ¬£750,000 per cottage lifestyle here lead a phoney county life where a BlackBerry is charged, not picked...Anywhere else in the world, country folk are desperate to appear city sophisticates; it's only in Britain that urbanites invest millions in buying a \\"country\\" pedigree.\\" Comedian Graeme Garden, who has lived locally for 30 years, said, \\"I can think of more acceptable reasons for Chipping Norton to be put on the map, rather than through any association with sleazy journalism... But Chipping Norton will get over it.\\" The Mayor of Chipping Norton said that \\"We would prefer to be put on the map for more positive things.\\" His wife, the mayoress, added, \\"Surely people are allowed to have supper at Christmas with their neighbours...Such a lot has been made of the celebrity factor. But we have a lot of well-known people in the area...because it is a beautiful place, and people are allowed to get on with things.\\" In his book I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan, fictional conservative ex-BBC presenter Alan Partridge said that he \\"would love to live in Chipping Norton; Brooks, Cameron, Clarkson, Murdoch.

Though some systems resemble a small PET scanner with a ring of detectors, others consist of a pair of gamma radiation detectors placed above and below the breast. On these systems, mild breast compression is applied to spread the breast and reduce its thickness. The detection process is identical to standard PET scanners. Positrons emitted by the injected 18F-FDG annihilate on interaction with electrons in tissue, leading to the emission of a pair of photons travelling in opposite directions. The detection of two simultaneous photons indicates the emission of a positron at a point on the line linking the two detection events. An image is the reconstructed from the collected emission data. History Mammography using positron emitters was first proposed in 1994. PEM is now approved in the United States and Europe for post-diagnosis imaging, with multiple commercial systems available.

Retrieved July 18, 2011 The Conciliator faction refrained from criticizing the hegemony of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the Comintern and they rejected all suggestion of a split in the KPD. A series of events between 1928 and 1930 led to a loss of their influence in the KPD. In autumn 1928, there was a scandal involving a close friend of Th√§lmann, John Wittorf, who was accused of embezzling between 1,500 and 3,000 Reichmarks from the KPD. He was defended by Th√§lmann, despite his guilt. Afterward, Th√§lmann was deposed from the party's central committee, with support of the Conciliator faction. Th√§lmann was soon reinstated by Joseph Stalin and the Conciliator faction was driven out of the KPD leadership. With Meyer's death in early 1930, the Conciliator faction lost a large part of its influence in the KPD and afterward, found themselves needing to be discreet. Pressure from Stalin led to the expulsion and defamation of several members. Individual, unaffiliated Conciliator groups began to emerge. In Hamburg, a group was formed by Hans Westermann in Hamburg. Eduard Wald founded the Committee for Proletarian Unity (Komitee f√ºr Proletarische Einheit) working primarily in Hanover. Others joined the Socialist Workers' Party or the Social Democratic Party (SPD). After 1933, when the Nazi Party seized control of the government, the Conciliators joined the German Resistance, both unaffiliated groups and those still in the KPD, such as the \\"Berlin Opposition\\" aligned with Karl Volk and Georg Krausz. There was a meeting of Conciliators in Zurich in 1933 and one group published a magazine in exile, called Funke. By 1940, many Conciliator groups had disintegrated, primarily because of repression by the Gestapo. Other prominent members, such as Eberlein and S√º√ükind, fell victim to the stalinist purges. Most members who survived the war rejoined the KPD and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and some joined the SPD.  Postwar term  After the war, the German word for conciliator, vers√∂hnler, was used in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) to refer to anti-Marxist tendencies. The term had been previously used by Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin to vilify certain party members. The third party convention of the SED continued the attack on Social Democratism, with propaganda including the fight against all liberalism and conciliatory tendencies as essential to the fight's effectiveness. The 1984 Handbuch der deutschen Gegenwartsprache (\\"Handbook of German Contemporary Speech\\") published in the GDR defined vers√∂hnler as \\"within the labor movement, someone who exhibits unprincipled anti-marxist behavior, fomenting right or left opportunism\\".

There Park was involved in the establishment of various Korean nationalist organizations in Denver, Nebraska and Hawaii. Park also founded the Korean Military Corps. Following the March 1st movement in 1919, Park became involved with the military training of Korean nationalists in China, but may have also engaged in anti-communist activity. Park was assassinated in Beijing by a Korean communist.  Early life  Park was born on 2 July 1881 in Cheorwon, a rural town in Gangwon province to a family with military traditions. After the death of his parents in his early childhood, Park was raised by his uncle, Park Hee- Byung. Together with his uncle, Park moved to Seoul, and then to Japan. He developed reformist leanings while in Japan, and upon his return to Korea, around 1897, became involved with various reformist and protest movements. His activities were frowned upon by the government and Park was imprisoned.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17 It was while he was incarcerated that he met Syngman Rhee, another reformist. Rhee was working on a book, \\"The Spirit of Independence\\", a treatise on reform and patriotism. Park assisted Rhee in the writing of his book, and smuggled the manuscript out of prison upon his release around 1903.Choe, Kim & Han, 2003 His uncle had by now returned to Korea and Park joined him in Sonchon, in what is now North Korea, and worked at a private school.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17 In late 1904 or early 1905, Park emigrated to the United States of America.Kim, 2003Tikhonov, 2009  Emigration to the U.S.   Life in Nebraska  Park Yong-man in his dormitory at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. Initially settling in Nebraska, Park was a student at the Hastings College. He then moved to Denver, Colorado to again join his uncle, who had also moved to the United States and was one of the first Korean immigrants to live in Denver. Together with his uncle, Park helped organise a Korean nationalist network in Denver. However, when his uncle was assassinated in 1907,McGhee, 2007 Park subsequently returned to Nebraska, this time to Lincoln to study political and military science at the University of Nebraska.Kim, 2003 By June 1909, and now recognized as one of the leaders of the Korean-American community, Park established a military school in Kearney, Nebraska.Lee, 1963 pp. 318 Park was a firm believer in military action against Japan in order to achieve an independent Korea, and such action clearly required trained fighters.Choe, Kim & Han, 2003 With his school, he aimed to provide young Korean-Americans with military drills and training for the anticipated clash with Japan. History, English, Korean and even agriculture were also taught to students.Nielsen, 1997 By 1910, Park was dabbling in journalism and was editor of the Korean newspaper The New Korea (Ïã†ÌïúÎØºÎ≥¥) published by the recently established Korean National Association (KNA) in San Francisco.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17 Syngman Rhee, by now released from prison and living in the United States, was asked to take over Park's military school, which had shifted from Kearney to Hastings, Nebraska. Upon his arrival, Rhee was highly critical of the school and only stayed a short time before departing.Nielsen, 1997 The school eventually was closed in 1915.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17 Life in Hawaii The KNA had one of its two headquarters in Hawaii, the other being in San Francisco,Choe, Kim & Han, 2003 and Park served as its vice-chairman for a time.Choi, 2002 pp. 43-71 This necessitated a move to Honolulu in 1912, and he continued his editorial work at the Korean National Herald. Also while in Hawaii, as Park still considered that a military confrontation with Japan was likely, he established the Korean Military Corps. A firm believer in the use of military force to secure independence for Korea, Park gradually fell out with Syngman Rhee and others in the KNA, who favored a more diplomatic solution to Korea's annexation by Japan. There were also clashes over funding, with Rhee preferring the available funds collected from the Korean-American community to be spent on education rather than maintaining the Korean Military Corps.Tikhonov, 2009 The funding issue became problematic, and the Corps was shut down in 1917 because of this.Choi, 2002 pp. 43-71 Back in Korea, opposition to Japanese rule was increasing, and following the 1 March 1919 uprising which resulted in the Declaration of Independence, Park translated the Declaration into English for publication in Honolulu.Kim, 2003 Then, in May 1919, Park joined the American Expeditionary Force, which was embarking for Siberia.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17  Return to Asia  Park Yong-man in military uniform The American Expeditionary Force had been dispatched to Siberia in 1918 to assist the Czechoslovak Legions in their retreat from the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Japanese forces were also present in the region, nominally to assist in fighting the Bolsheviks, but also as part of a process to expand their influence in North East Asia. Consequently, Park appears to have considered his sojourn to Siberia as an ideal start to combating Japanese colonialism.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17 His role with the American Expeditionary Force was as an intelligence officer, and it is likely that he collected information on the communist Koreans present in Siberia at the time.Kim, 2003 In the interim, three separate Provisional Governments of Korea (PGK) had been established, one each in Seoul, Vladivistok and Shanghai. By September 1919, these had merged into a single government in Shanghai, with Syngman Rhee (in absentia) appointed as president. Park was offered the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional Government.Neff, 2010 Park, having finished his duties with the American Expeditionary Force, arrived in Shanghai in March 1920. However, it seems that Park was only part of the PGK for a few months, if at all.Lee, 1963 pp. 318 It is possible that the selection of Syngman Rhee as head of the PKG was a factor in deterring Park from playing a more significant role with the organisation.Kim, 2002, pp. 16-17 Park was also involved with negotiations to form a secret mutual defense pact between the newly established PGK and the Soviets. Park was now based in Manchuria, spending time training recruits and preparing for a military campaign against Japan. Little is known about his activities in Manchuria, but he returned to Korea at least once, in 1924, with a group of military and business leaders of the pro-Japanese Chinese government.Kim, 2003 Park, now under suspicion of collaborating with the Japanese against communism due to his activities in Siberia and Manchuria, was assassinated in Beijing on 17 October 1928 by a Korean communist, Lee Hae-young.Choi, 2002 pp. 43-71  See also  *History of Korea *Korean independence movement *Sinhan Minbo  Notes   References      * Category:1881 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from Cheorwon County Category:Korean independence activists Category:Korean revolutionaries Category:Korean people murdered abroad Category:University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln alumni ","title":"Park Yong-man"},{"id":"32449181","text":"Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers from Hundred Schools of Thought in Zhou Dynasty. Philosophers of Naturalist are marked by circles in yellow. The School of Naturalists or the School of Yin-yang () was a Warring States- era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of yin-yang and the Five Elements. Overview Zou Yan is considered the founder of this school. His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth). In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of Yan and Qi. In later periods, these epistemological theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief. This school was absorbed into the alchemic and magical dimensions of Taoism as well as into the Chinese medical framework. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the Ma Wang Dui texts and Huang Di Nei Jing. Figures Zou Yan (; 305240 BC) was an ancient Chinese philosopher best known as the representative thinker of the Yin and Yang School (or School of Naturalists) during the Hundred Schools of Thought era in Chinese philosophy. Zou Yan was a noted scholar of the Jixia Academy in the state of Qi. Joseph Needham, a British sinologist, describes Zou as \\"The real founder of all Chinese scientific thought.\\" His teachings combined and systematized two current theories during the Warring States period: Yin-Yang and the Five Elements/Phases (wood, fire, earth, metal, and water). During the Han dynasty, the concepts of the school were integrated into Confucian ideology, Zhang Cang (253-152 BCE) and Dong Zhongshu (179-104 BCE) being the chief instrumental figures behind this process.

A 5‚Äì10 record in the January 2012 tournament meant he suffered demotion to j≈´ry≈ç in March, but he produced a 10‚Äì5 record in Osaka, ensuring a return to makuuchi. In July 2012 he scored eleven wins, picking up his second Fighting Spirit Award and earning promotion to maegashira 1. In September he just fell short with a 7‚Äì8 record, losing to H≈çmash≈ç on the final day. Since then he has largely alternated winning and losing tournaments. Though he has proven his longevity in the top division, it remains to be seen whether he can achieve more consistent performances. He has yet to defeat a yokozuna in more than 30 attempts. Kaisei made his san'yaku debut in the May 2016 tournament, having been promoted to komusubi on the back of an 11‚Äì4 record from the rank of maegashira 7. He is the second wrestler from Tomozuna stable to reach komusubi since the present stablmeaster took over in 1989 and the first since Kai≈ç in 1994. After coming through with an 8‚Äì7 record he earned immediate promotion to sekiwake for the following July tournament. In the last three tournaments of 2016 he posted losing records and dropped to maegashira 9 before recording an 8‚Äì7 in January 2017. He injured his knee training with Hakuh≈ç shortly before the March 2017 tournament and had to withdraw from a honbasho for the first time in his career, bringing to an end his run of 739 consecutive matches from debut, the most among active top division wrestlers. He was demoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time since 2012 after the May 2017 tournament, but made an immediate return to makuuchi after scoring 10‚Äì5 at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 1 in July. In the September 2017 tournament, at West Maegashira #13, he managed to get a record of 9‚Äì6. Being promoted to East Maegashira #10 for the November 2017 tournament, Kaisei finished with a record of 8‚Äì7. In January 2018, at West Maegashira #8, Kaisei finished 8‚Äì7. The March 2018 Tournament saw Kaisei promoted to East Maegashira #6 where he won his first 9 matches, only to lose to Ichinojo on day 10. On day 13 Kaisei was brought up to face yokozuna Kakuryu where he lost. Kaisei finished off the tournament with a 12‚Äì3 record, being a runner-up to Kakuryu, with fellow runner-up Takayasu. This marks the second time that Kaisei was runner-up. Kaisei also got the Fighting Spirit Prize, his third time claiming that prize. In November 2018 Kaisei returned to the sanyaku ranks at komusubi for the first time in 13 tournaments. However, he was restricted by a left calf injury suffered in training shortly before the tournament, missing the first two days and then withdrawing on Day 14 with only three wins, after aggravating the injury. He was also forced to withdraw from the May 2019 tournament after injuring his right bicep tendon against Ry≈´den on Day 7. Fighting at maegashira 15 in July, he injured his right arm and eventually withdrew on Day 11 with only one win, resulting in his demotion to j≈´ry≈ç. He returned to the top division after an 11‚Äì4 record in November 2019. Kaisei obtained Japanese citizenship in November 2014 and has indicated he would like to stay in sumo as a coach after his eventual retirement from competition. Family Kaisei announced in July 2020 that he had got married the previous month to a woman in her 20s after a five year relationship. Fighting style Kaisei's favoured techniques are listed at the Sumo Association as migi-yotsu (a left hand outside, right hand inside grip on the opponent's mawashi), yori (forcing) and oshi (pushing). His most common winning kimarite are straightforward: yori-kiri (force out) and oshi dashi (push out).

She, however, is slowly dying from a debilitating disease. During an epidemic, Albrecht goes to bring her daughter to safety but he catches typhoid and is quarantined in hospital. Octavia, realising the love match, and hearing that √Ñls is now bedridden and dying, dresses up as him and rides by her gates every day to keep her spirits up‚Äîher bed is next to the window.

It was a commercial success and, with its theme of a woman remaining faithful to her husband, was important in raising the morale of German forces; it remained popular after World War II. Plot Elisabeth (Kristina S√∂derbaum) falls in love with Reinhardt (Carl Raddatz), but he leaves their native village to study music, travel the world and build his career as a composer. His most important compositions are inspired by his love for her, Twelve Songs of Elisabeth and Seerosen (water lilies, the couple's special flower), but after she visits him on the day of his final examination at the conservatoire and finds a strange woman asleep in his bed, Elisabeth marries Erich (Paul Klinger), the wealthy heir to the estate of Immensee. Reinhardt returns to win her back, and Erich releases her, telling her that all that he wants is for her to be happy. This causes Elisabeth to realise what love really means and she tells Erich for the first time that she loves him, and remains with him. In the frame story, many years have passed, Erich is dead and Elisabeth and Reinhardt, who is now a renowned composer, meet for tea at his hotel after a performance of his Seerosen; at the end of the film, she tells him she will remain true to Erich and to Immensee, and he leaves for the last time.Jo Fox, Filming Women in the Third Reich, Oxford/New York: Berg, 2000, , pp. 57, 58, 64.David Stewart Hull, Film in the Third Reich: A Study of the German Cinema, 1933‚Äì1945, Berkeley, California: University of California, 1969, , pp. 216-17. The film is loosely based on Theodor Storm's novella of the same title.Cinzia Romani, tr. Robert Connolly, Tainted Goddesses: Female Film Stars of the Third Reich, New York: Sarpedon, 1992, repr. Rome: Gremese, 2001, , p. 87. The scene where Elisabeth finds a woman in Reinhardt's bed had been omitted from the novella on the advice of friends of the author, and two thirds of the novella takes place in Elisabeth and Reinhardt's childhood; instead of using child actors, Harlan chose to cut these scenes and artificially age the two lovers for different stages of their lives (from about 18 to 45 for Elisabeth). Both S√∂derbaum and Raddatz were 31 at the time of filming.Richard J. Rundell, \\"Literary Nazis? Adapting Nineteenth-Century German Novellas for the Screen: Der Schimmelreiter, Kleider machen Leute, and Immensee\\", in Robert C. Reimer, ed., Cultural History through a National Socialist Lens: Essays on the Cinema of the Third Reich, Studies in German literature, linguistics and culture, Rochester, New York / Woodbridge, Suffolk: Camden House/Boydell and Brewer, 2000, repr. 2002, , pp.176-96, pp. 191-92. Despite being subtitled Ein deutsches Volkslied (a German folksong), the film also omits a conversation about folksongs which is important in the novella, in which Erich is dismissive but Reinhardt expounds a German Romanticist view entirely in accord with National Socialism, that \\"[Folksongs are] not made at all; they grow, they fall out of the sky\\" and refers to a melody sung by a shepherd as Urt√∂ne (ancient tones) which \\"sleep on forest floors; God knows who found them.\\"Rundell, pp. 193-94. Themes The character of Elisabeth is presented as a model of \\"German fidelity\\" and the sanctity of marriage,Fox, p. 58. and also of sacrifice, as often in Nazi images of women.Fox, p. 64. As a secondary thematic focus common in many Nazi films, the film contrasts country life and rootedness with internationality and urban sophistication, to the detriment of the latter. The summarised: \\"[Elisabeth] stays at home, deeply rooted and always strong in the homely countryside, which her whole heart is attached to\\"; Reinhardt is pulled away by \\"music and the world.\\"Quoted in Fox, p. 59. After Elisabeth finds a girl in Reinhardt's bed, his landlady explains, \\"These are artists. . . they are more liberal in these matters.\\"Antje Ascheid, Hitler's Heroines: Stardom and Womanhood in Nazi Cinema, Culture and the moving image, Philadelphia: Temple University, 2003, , p. 82. After an affair with an opera singer in Rome, Reinhardt realises that he really loves Elisabeth--who in this instance represents his homeland, Germany.Fox, p. 61. Conversely Erich represents the homeland for Elisabeth.Ascheid, p. 84. At one point Elisabeth is shown swimming naked in the lake, portraying healthy outdoor life. Production Immensee was shot primarily in Holstein, on alternating days with Opfergang, to save money on colour production; Harlan's previous film, Die goldene Stadt, had been very expensive. Originally he proposed to shoot three films simultaneously using the same principals and mostly the same locations and sets, but the third, Pole Poppensp√§ler, another novella by Storm, was dropped. Additional exteriors were shot in Rome.Rundell, pp. 188-89. Joseph Goebbels was so pleased with Die goldene Stadt that he did not interfere with the production of Immensee, and Harlan wrote in 1974: \\"Of all the films that I made during the war, this was the only one which remained true to the original scenarios and was distributed just as I had foreseen.\\"Hull, p. 216.Fox, p. 65. He said that he filmed the novella \\"to reflect his love for his wife\\", S√∂derbaum; she and Raddatz, who played Reinhardt in Immensee and Albrecht in Opfergang, believed that both films were successful with the public because of the genuine chemistry between them. S√∂derbaum received 60,000 RM for her work on the film, three times as much as Raddatz.Rundell, p. 194. Reception Immensee was highly successful, making a profit of 4,305,000 RM on an investment of 2,059,000 RM; it made 800,000 RM in its first month and with a longer run, would likely have overtaken Die goldene Stadt as the all-time leading moneymaker among German films.\\"Bei der Ufa machte man das so ...\\", Der Spiegel, 17 January 1951 . It was seen by more than 8 million people within the original borders of the Reich. At a time when German forces were greatly concerned about the fidelity of their womenfolk left at home, the film was \\"one of the most important cinematic contributions to front-line morale\\".Fox, p. 57. As part of the front and home-front morale effort, it was specially distributed to locations where there was no cinema. S√∂derbaum received many letters from men at the front; she said in a 1993 interview: \\"The soldiers were homesick at the front. And the girl I played was an ideal for them. She loved her husband and was faithful to him. I still get letters today.\\"Fox, pp. 57-58, quoting from Hans-Christoph Blumenberg, Die Reise nach Schweden. Kristina S√∂derbaum. Portr√§t einer Schauspielerin, Interview, Zdf/Sat, 1993.Also in her memoirs, Nichts bleibt immer so: R√ºckblenden auf ein Leben vor und hinter der Kamera; Mary-Elizabeth O'Brien, Nazi Cinema as Enchantment: The Politics of Entertainment in the Third Reich, Studies in German literature, linguistics, and culture, Rochester, New York / Woodbridge, Suffolk: Camden House/Boydell & Brewer, 2004, , p. 167 and note 27, p. 197. Klaus Jebens, who had been a young soldier in 1943, remembered the film so fondly that in 1975 he bought the estate on Lake Pl√∂n where shooting had taken place, and was still living there twenty years later.\\"Fernseh-Vorschau: Der Menschen H√∂rigkeit\\", Die Zeit Culture, 14 May 1993 : \\"Blumenberg hat . . . sogar den seltsamen Erfinder und S√∂derbaum Verehrer Klaus Jebens auf seinem 'Immensee' Hof am Pl√∂ner See besucht.\\" - \\"Blumenberg . . . even visited the strange inventor and S√∂derbaum admirer, Klaus Jebens, at his estate on Lake Pl√∂n.\\" In 1993 he said: \\"It was very depressing. It was wartime. The whole world was . . . destroyed and then we saw this film with this unfulfilled love.\\"Fox, p. 65, quoting the Blumenberg interview. In an assessment of S√∂derbaum's career following her death, a reviewer judged Immensee to be probably her finest work, providing \\"the indispensable grain of believability and grounding\\" for Harlan's \\"excessive filmic phantasies\\" and the unmoving centre holding the film together against the \\"centrifugal forces\\" set up by the externalisation of the novella's internal narrative, with the Roman scenes and their \\"explicitly stated association between Italian architecture and German music\\" pulling the focus away from the Holstein setting.Doris Neujahr, \\"Dieser Zug zur Rebellion: Mit dem Tod der Schauspielerin Kristina S√∂derbaum endet ein Kapitel deutscher Filmgeschichte\\", Junge Freiheit, 23 February 2001 Postwar assessments of the film itself have been mixed. Louis Marcorelles saw it as \\"a film of peace and love . . . convey[ing] a strong feeling for nature and a fervent idyllic mood\\";Louis Marcorelles, \\"The Nazi Cinema (1933-1945)\\", Sight and Sound 25 (Autumn 1955) 65-69, p. 68, quoted in Hull, p. 216 and Rundell, pp. 189-90. David Stewart Hull, in his 1969 survey of Film in the Third Reich, said it was \\"still successful. It has been frequently revived and its original power remains undiminished.\\"Hull, p. 217. In 1989 Norbert Grob, calling for a re-evaluation of the director's legacy, referred to it as one of eight \\"melodramatic masterpieces\\" by Harlan that merit study as cinematic texts.Norbert Grob, \\"Veit Harlan\\", in Hans-Michael Bock (ed.), CineGraph. Lexikon zum deutschsprachigen Film, Installment 15, Munich: edition text + kritik, 1989, p. E4, cited in Eric Rentschler, The Ministry of Illusion: Nazi Cinema and Its Afterlife, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University, 1996, , pp. 167-68. However, Christa Bandmann and Joe Hembus, in their 1980 survey of \\"classics of German sound film\\", find in it \\"plodding sentimentality\\" and sum up the message as: \\"At this time--it's 1943--a German woman waits, is true to her husband, and does without.\\"Christa Bandmann and Joe Hembus, Klassiker des deutschen Tonfilms 1930-1960, Munich: Goldmann, 1980, , p. 217, quoted in Rundell, p. 191. Richard J. Rundell writes of \\"weepy sentimentality\\" and says that \\"the saccharine tone is made far worse by Wolfgang Zeller's bombastic musical score.\\"Rundell, p. 191. Antje Ascheid finds Elisabeth \\"an unremarkable and dull character\\" and sums up the film as \\"[speaking] to contemporary audiences by reflecting a mood of resignation and depression\\", its \\"ideological fatalism\\" an increasingly common response in Nazi culture to the worsening wartime situation.Ascheid, pp. 80, 86.

She also had a regular role in the 1960‚Äì1961 ABC sitcom Harrigan and Son. Life and career Darcy was born in Brooklyn, New York. Darcy's mother urged her to become a stripper, just like her character in Rear Window, to make a \\"fast buck\\". She studied ballet, and danced with the New York City Ballet, and was a model. At age 16, she left home and traveled by bus to California. In 1954 she was cast in Rear Window. She did not even know who Hitchcock was and did not consider herself an actress. Hitchcock had selected her based on a publicity photo of her wearing a black leotard and green feather boa. In Rear Window, she played one of the neighbors of protagonist L. B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart), a wheelchair-bound photographer who passes the time spying on the other tenants of his neighborhood. Her nameless character, who was dubbed \\"Miss Torso\\", practiced her dance moves in a skimpy top and a pair of pink shorts with a 21-inch waistband, courtesy of famed costume designer Edith Head. She had no lines in the film until the end when she greets Stanley who has returned from military service. During filming, Hitchcock asked her what kinds of pie she liked and disliked. She told him she loathed pumpkin pie. When it came time to film her character's reaction to finding a strangled dog, he presented her with pumpkin pie served with \\"crude Cockney jokes\\" to prompt an adverse response. On the last day of filming, Hitchcock and some of the cast presented her with a cake in the shape of her voluptuous figure. \\"It had the breasts and everything!\\" she said. Hitchcock told Darcy that she should get an agent and that if she studied Anton Chekov in Europe, he could make her a movie star when she returned. She ignored both pieces of advice and thought he was joking about the latter. She was paid $350 for her work in Rear Window and had a sporadic acting career. Her most substantive role was in the Chubby Checker film Don't Knock the Twist (1962). She played Madge Albright, a \\"dancing firestorm\\" who is part of a brother- sister dance team. She also appeared in the films Women and Bloody Terror (1970) and The Delta Factor (1970). On television, she played Gypsy, an irreverent secretary for the title father-son team of lawyers in Harrigan and Son, played by Pat O'Brien and Roger Perry. She also had guest appearances on Lee Marvin's M Squad, the Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse and Mitch Connors's Mannix. Darcy was the subject of the 2004 documentary short film Remembering Miss Torso by director Malcolm Venville. She died of natural causes and was survived by her husband of thirty years, actor Byron Palmer. She was said to be the last surviving credited cast member of Rear Window. However, Frank Cady, who appeared as the Thorwalds' upstairs neighbor, survived until 2012 and Harry Landers, who played the uncredited role of Miss Lonelyheart's guest, died in 2017. Rand Harper, who played the role of the honeymooning groom, also survives.

The conservation area, which is located in eastern St. Louis County, Missouri, north of the city of St. Louis, is operated by the Missouri Department of Conservation. One key asset is of river frontage for boating, fishing, and birdwatching. History and description The mouth of the Missouri River was at first thought to be a good site for commercial development, and the would- be town of Columbia, Missouri was platted on the south bank of the confluence. However, the wetland character of the site made it sub-optimal for development. At a later point the site was re-platted as St. Vrain, Missouri, but both developments were fated to become ghost towns by 1870, and it is not known how many inhabitants either community had. Following the failure of the ghost towns, the Columbia Bottom reverted to being wet-footed but fertile farmland. The current conservation area was formed in 1997 as a result of the land condemnations that followed the Great Flood of 1993. Patches of the area continued to be managed by the private sector as agricultural land as of 2011. The nearest limited access highway exit is Exit 34 on Interstate 270, at the northern tip of the city of St. Louis. From this exit it is north on Columbia Bottom Road to the entrance to the conservation area. Trail at Columbia Bottom Conservation Area Admission to the conservation area was free as of 2011. A parking lot and graveled overlook, completed in 2002, provided access to the river confluence, and a visitor center, completed in 2004, stood close to the entrance. The conservation area is located across the Missouri River from the Jones-Confluence Point State Park. Wildlife Indigo bunting at Conservation Area in June 2013 While the Columbia Bottom Conservation Area was originally planned as a place for sportspeople to carry out the taking of game animals such as the whitetail deer and Canada goose, the area has proved to be a popular place for wetland birdwatching.

The Agriculturalists believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king Shennong, a folk hero who was portrayed in Chinese literature as \\"working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached.\\" They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society. Agriculturalism was suppressed during the Qin Dynasty and most original texts are now lost. However, concepts originally associated with Agriculturalism have influenced Confucianism and Legalism, as well as Chinese philosophy as a whole. Agriculturalism has at times been viewed as the essence of the Chinese identity. History To the Agriculturalists, the governance and focus on agriculture by the legendary ruler Shennong served as a model of the ideal government Agriculturalism dates back to the Spring and Autumn period and Warring States period, during a period known as the \\"Hundred Schools of Thought\\" which flourished from 770 to 221 BC. Throughout this period, competing states, seeking to war with one another and unite China as a single country, patronized philosophers, scholars, and teachers. The competition by scholars for the attention of rulers led to the development of different schools of thought, and the emphasis on recording teachings into books encouraged their spread. The result was an era characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments. The major philosophies of China, Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, and Taoism, all originated from this period. Chinese tradition attributes the origin of Agriculturalism to the Chinese minister Hou Ji, a figure known for his innovations in agriculture. The Agriculturalists also emphasized the role of Shennong, the divine farmer, a semi-mythical ruler of early China credited by the Chinese as the inventor of agriculture. Shennong was seen as a proto-Agriculturalist, whose governance and focus on agriculture served as a model of the ideal Agriculturalist government. Xu Xing, a philosopher who defended Agriculturalism, settled with a group of followers in the state of Teng in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher Mencius, and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives. Killing the Scholars and Burning the Books, anonymous 18th century Chinese painted album leaf; Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Paris The rise of the Qin Dynasty in 221 BC saw the \\"burning of books and burying of scholars,\\" that is, the purge of the Hundred Schools of Thought. This included Agriculturalism. The Legalist Qin dynasty was intolerant of other schools of thought, seeking to burn any text that did not adhere to the Legalist philosophy. Because of this, few Agriculturalist texts exist, and most of what is known of Agriculturalism comes from critical assessments by other philosophical schools. The bibliography of the Book of Han (2nd century AD) presents Agriculturalism as one of 10 philosophical schools and lists 9 books belonging to that school. Philosophy Agriculturalism is primarily a social, economic, and political philosophy. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of agriculture, and societies are based upon \\"people's natural prospensity to farm.\\" The Agriculturalists described the ancient political system, seen as ideal, as one where \\"the means by which the early sage kings led their people was to put agriculture before all other affairs...the reason why Hou Ji undertook agriculture was because he considered it to be the root of instructing the masses.\\" Political To the Agriculturalists, the ideal society, modeled after that of Shennong's, is communal, agrarian, and egalitarian. The Agriculturalist believed that the ideal government is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields and cooking his own meals, not his leadership. Said Xu Xing, a prominent Agriculturalist: Economic Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the division of labour, arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self sufficiency. The Agriculturalists supported the fixing of prices, in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They suggested that people should be paid the same amount for the same services, a policy criticized by the Confucians as encouraging products of low quality, which \\"destroys the earnest standards of craftmanship.\\" Reception Agriculturalism was criticized extensively by rival philosophical schools, including the Mohist Mo Zi, the Confucian Mencius, and Yang Zhu. Mencius criticized its chief proponent Xu Xing for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects, arguing that the Agriculturalist egalitarianism ignored the division of labour central to society. He points out that other early Chinese rulers did not work in fields, yet were equally as successful and revered as Shennong. Mencius dismisses Xu Xing as a \\"Southern barbarian with a twittering tongue.\\" Influence Due to its Legalist focus, the Qin Dynasty was thorough in its purging of rival philosophical schools, including Agriculturalism. However, Agriculturalism in its heyday heavily influenced the agrarian policies of Confucianism, Legalism, and other contemporary Chinese philosophical schools, and so subsequently many concepts originally associated with the Agriculturalists continued to exist in Chinese philosophy. The transmission and translation of Chinese philosophical texts in Europe during the 18th century had a heavy influence on the development of Agrarianism in Europe. French agrarianist philosophy, a predecessor to modern Agrarianism, are said to have been modeled after the agrarian policies of Chinese philosophy.

Parker Rd. in Centennial, Colorado. It is a 33-acre former stagecoach stop with a square log structure covered with clapboard. It was a stopping place during the 1800s along the Smoky Hill Trail. It is one of the last two remaining trail houses left on the trail. Mary Hightower was the original owner of the house, having moved there in 1866. It was almost torn down in 1977 until negative publicity stopped it from happening. The site was zoned for commercial development until the County of Arapahoe acquired the land in 2001. History The first Colorado Gold Rush in 1858-1859 began an influx of horse and wagon traffic to Denver, and two of the routes were the historic Smoky Hill Trail from Kansas and Cherokee Trail from Oklahoma. Six way stations sprang up along Cherry Creek, serving travelers in the final stretch into Denver after the two trails merged.http://www.parkerhistory.org/#!cherokee-and-smoky-hill-trails/c1z48 Railroad service reached Denver in 1870, and the wagon trails gradually fell into disuse. Seventeen Mile House closed and became a working farm alongside the Cherry Creek River by the 1880s. It is one of two surviving Way Stations. The stations were named according to how many miles each site is from downtown Denver's intersection of Colfax and Broadway. Four Mile House is the other way station still standing.http://www.fourmilepark.org/ Current Site and Future Plans Today Seventeen Mile House shows the layout as of the 1910s, long after it became a working farm. In 2001, local historic and preservation groups worked together to acquire the property for Arapahoe County.http://www.co.arapahoe.co.us/facilities/facility/details/17-Mile-House- Farm-Park-23 Arapahoe County has a 2007 Master Plan for Seventeen Mile House serving as vision and roadmap.http://www.arapahoegov.com/index.aspx?NID=458 Today the site is an Open Space park administered by Arapahoe County, Colorado, with the Cherry Creek Valley Historical Societyhttp://www.ccvhsco.com/17-mile-house-farm-park.html giving monthly open house tours, and involved in preservation and development. An annual Fall Festival has been held in recent years. This Open Space borders two other Open Spaces, thus contributing to a regional corridor for wildlife areas and biking/hiking trails along the Cherry Creek Valley, which includes Denver's extensive Cherry Creek Reservoir State Park.

Alaska from Air, Graphic Arts Center Publishing Co., page 35, 2003. The rare blue ice is formed from the compression of pure snow, which then develops into glacial ice.Warren, S. G.; Roesler, C. S.; Morgan, V. I.; Brandt, R. E.; Goodwin, I. D.; and Allison, I. (1993). \\"Green icebergs formed by freezing of organic-rich seawater to the base of Antarctic ice shelves\\" Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans, 98, Volume: 98, Issue: C4, William Byrd Press for Johns Hopkins Press, pp. 6921-6928, 1993Marshall Cavendish Corporation. Aquatic Life of the World, Volume 5, Marshall Cavendish, page 260, 2000. Icebergs may also appear blue due to light refraction and age. Older icebergs reveal vivid hues of green and blue, resulting from a high concentration of color, microorganisms, and compacted ice. One of the better known blue icebergs rests in the waters off Sermilik fjord near Greenland. It is described as an electric blue iceberg and is known to locals as \\"blue diamond\\".  Physics of light and color  Blue iceberg seen in the Ilulissat Icefjord, 2015 ;White icebergs Commonly seen white icebergs generally derive their color from the snow and frost remaining on the surface which results in the uniform reflection of incident light. Young glaciers that have not undergone years of compression, may also appear white. Due to the age of the iceberg, there remains a tremendous amount of air and reflective surfaces. The iceberg easily reflects the sun as white light. ;Preferential light absorption and age Blue icebergs develop from older, deep glaciers which have undergone tremendous pressure experienced for hundreds of years. The process releases and eliminates air that was originally caught in the ice by falling snow. Therefore, icebergs that have been formed from older glaciers have little internal air or reflective surfaces. When long wavelength light (i.e. red) from the sun hits the iceberg, it is absorbed, rather than reflected. The light transmitted or refracted through the ice returns as blue or blue-green. Older glaciers also reflect incident light preferentially at the short wavelength end of the spectrum (i.e. blue) due to Rayleigh scattering, much in the same way that makes the sky blue. ;Color spectrum and water Light is absorbed and reflected in water. Visible white light is made up of a spectrum of colors from the rainbow, ranging from red to violet. As the light travels through the water, the waves of light from the red end of the spectrum dissipate (i.e. are absorbed), while those from the blue end, become more prominent. Underwater divers have direct experience of these effects. Above the water, all the colors remain visible. As the diver swims deeper under water, the colors begin to disappear, starting with red. At an approximate depth of , red is no longer visible to the naked eye. At , yellow looks greenish-blue, because the water has absorbed the yellow light. Finally, all that remains visible to the naked eye, appears as a mutation of blue or green, while the water above the surface filters out the sunlight. As the diver swims deeper into the ocean, he finds that the blue colors start to disappear, to the point where the underwater world deep below the surface, becomes completely black, devoid of any color at all.Graver, Dennis. Scuba diving, 4th ed. Human Kinetics, pp. 31-32, 2010. Sherratt, Thomas N.; and Wilkinson, David M. Big questions in ecology and evolution, Oxford University Press US, page 172, 2009.  RMS Titanic  Since 1912, reports made by witnesses of the RMS Titanic tragedy have stated that the ship hit a blue iceberg.Bonner, Kit; and Bonner, Carolyn. Great Ship Disasters, Zenith Imprint, page 43, 2003. Following the sinking and subsequent discovery of the Titanic, scientific research and forensic analysis have reconstructed the tragedy to ascertain the reliability of the statements made by the survivors. Reports released in the last decade of the 20th century have shown that a blue iceberg in the north Atlantic would have been easily detected.McCarty, Jennifer Hooper; Foecke, Tim. What Really Sank the Titanic: New Forensic Discoveries, Kensington Publishing Corporation, page 67, 2009. Alternative theories suggest that pack ice, rather than a blue iceberg, was responsible for sinking the ship.Collins, L.M.

It has become an iconic part of the city's skyline, with the exterior of the building having a pink salmon color and concrete structure, along with having a postmodern style with multiple gables at the top. The building was originally known to have the National Science Center at Fort Discovery, which closed in December 2010. It has also been found to be the 80th tallest building in the state of Georgia.Georgia Skyscraper Diagram SkyscraperPage.com. Retrieved 2015-07-01. History The concept of the building was developed on November 24, 1987 by French investors who unveiled plans to develop an $18 million, three-tower complex along the Savannah River called Port Royal. The complex will comprise condominiums, a shopping center, and a hotel. Even though the hotel never went through, construction for the tower and the center started 10 months later. On May 7, 1991, Port Royal had its grand opening, which was completed as a $45 million project. It includes the 18-story tower that features 56 condominiums and 128,000 square feet of retail space. This became the Shoppes of Port Royale, which opened two days later and was proven to be unsuccessful. Retailers began shutting down within a year, and, during the first two years, only seven of the luxury condos were sold, with listings up to $400,000. The shopping center became dead in 1995, and the state Board of Education agreed to transfer $10 million in lottery money to help fund construction for the new museum that will take its spot. After its completion, the new National Science Center at Fort Discovery had its grand opening on April 23, 1997. This project received $13 million in state and local government money, and a private fund-raising campaign created an extra $6.5 million. However, Fort Discovery suffered terribly when it dropped two-thirds of its staff and reduced its hours when state funds were delaying. After a few years, Fort Discovery closed on December 31, 2010 after 13 years of operation. The site has been stripped to its bare concrete floors and columns to make way for any new development. Future In January 2012, after more than a year on the market, the Fort Discovery property below River Place Condominiums was purchased for $2.1 million by California businessman Moshe Silagi. The name of the center was soon changed to Discovery Plaza, and has been renovated several times to become an office complex. The center will be able house up to 700 workers within the next five years and plans to serve both government and commercial clients. It also features an auditorium, with a capacity of 220, that will be for community and public purposes, along with a base of operations for the police in the region. The facility has been viewed by Unisys multiple times, which then announced that it will select Discovery Plaza as the permanent site for a new client service center. The company is currently using temporary office space throughout Augusta and expects to be moved in later this year. The service center will be used to provide IT support services to Fort Gordon and the U.S. Army, which recently selected Unisys for the Army Enterprise Service Desk, a single point of contact for Army personnel who need help desk or other end-user IT support services.

He is also known for his translations of Terence‚Äôs The Eunuch (Eunuchus), and Plautus' The Brothers Menaechmus (Menaechmi),Bryn Mawr Classical Review: http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2000/2000-01-11.html as well as other classical and literary works. His translations of plays have been republished multiple times, and have been performed around the world. Lysistrata has had over two hundred productions. Parker was Professor of Classics at the University of Texas at Austin for forty years, recruited there in 1967 by William Arrowsmith. Earlier he had been a professor at Yale (1953-55) and at the University of California, Riverside (1955-67). He taught classes in Greek and Latin languages and literature, as well as a discipline of his own creation, parageography‚Äîthe study of imaginary worlds. His courses crossed traditional disciplinary boundaries and were popular; he was known at the University of Texas for his breadth of knowledge and teaching, and won graduate and undergraduate teaching awards. In 2011 the Journal Didaskalia dedicated its new endeavors to \\"Douglass Parker, who embodied the interplay between scholarship and practice, between an acute understanding of the ancient world and a keen sense of modern audience.\\" Didaskalia subsequently published a pair of wide-ranging interviews from 1981 and 1982. Parker had a passion for jazz, playing the trombone throughout his life, and elements of jazz improvisation and creativity were themes in his research and teaching. He also had interests in fantasy and science fiction, and published one of the first scholarly analyses of Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings. Creativity and fantasy are foundations of imaginary worlds‚Äîincluding those of the Odyssey, the Land of Oz, and Middle Earth‚Äîand in parageography Parker sought insight on the creative process of writing. He referred to the parageography course as \\"a course in 'Applied Creativity'\\". Parker often combined elements of creativity with comedy, and starting in 1979 for example, developed installments of Zeus in Therapy, a series of humorous verse monologues in which Zeus reflects on his experiences and complains to his therapist about difficulties of managing the universe. The imagined sessions in these installments get at the power of one's innermost thoughts. A theatrical adaptation of \\"Zeus in Therapy\\" was developed by the Tutto Theatre Company in August 2013.

Description Pentaclethra macroloba is a canopy tree which reaches heights of and a trunk diameter of . Leaves are twice compound, arranged in a spiral on the stems. The leaf blades, which can be up to long, consist of 15 to 20 paired leaflets long. Flowers are small, with purple petals ( long) becoming greenish towards their tips. Inflorescences are racemes; despite producing about 200 flowers per inflorescence, each one produces only a few fruit. Distribution The species ranges from Nicaragua to the Amazon basin and exists in three distinct populations. One population ranges from the Amazon, through Venezuela and the Guianas, to Trinidad and Tobago. The second population occurs in western Colombia and Darien Province in Panama. The third is found in western Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. It grows in lowland forest from sea level to 600 m above sea level, and is especially abundant in wetter areas. Ecology Seeds are mechanically dispersed when mature pods split. Submerged seeds developed air pockets that allowed them to float; this has been interpreted as evidence that the species has adaptions for dispersal by water (hydrochory). Like many leguminous plants, P. macroloba is a nitrogen fixer which forms a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium, which grows in specialised root nodules. While root nodules are typically found on buried roots, P. macroloba individuals growing in swampy areas produce nodules on aerial roots. Uses Timber The sapwood of the tree is whitish, drying to pink, while the heartwood is reddish brown. The timber has a specific gravity of 0.51‚Äì0.61 and is used to make furniture, cabinets and for general construction. Oil Pracaxi oil Pracaxi oil, which is extracted from the seeds of P. macroloba, is rich in oleic, linoleic, and behenic acid, and is used medicinally by indigenous Amazonian populations. It is used as a replacement for synthetic hair conditioners in 'green' cosmetics.

She claimed during an interview published in the June 1973 edition of Star Magazine that she had sexual relationships with Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Alice Cooper, David Bowie, and Marc Bolan. At the time of the interview she was 16, but despite the age of consent in California being 18, none of the people she named were investigated for child sexual abuse or charged with a criminal offence in relation to these alleged encounters. Life as a groupie Starr first attended concerts around Los Angeles with older friends who had dropped out of school in late 1968. She claims to have lost her virginity at age 12 with Spirit guitarist Randy California after a gig at Topanga, California. She had a younger sister, Corel Shields (born 1959), who according to Chris Charlesworth was involved with Iggy Pop in Autumn 1973, when Corel was 13-14. Pop later immortalized his involvement with Starr herself in the 1996 song \\"Look Away.\\" It refers to Sable being thirteen, which would be in 1970 or 1971. > I slept with Sable when she was 13, Her parents were too rich to do > anything, > She rocked her way around L.A., 'Til a New York Doll carried her away‚Ä¶ Starr became one of the first \\"baby groupies\\" who in the early 1970s frequented the Rainbow Bar and Grill, the Whisky A Go Go, and Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco; these were trendy nightclubs on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip. The girls were named as such because of their young age. She got started after a friend invited her to the Whisky A Go Go at the age of 14. Starr later described herself at that period as having been \\"nuts to begin with. I always liked getting into trouble\\". She had considered herself unattractive, so she had a nose job when she was 15. During the time Starr was a groupie, she continued to live at home with her family and attended Palos Verdes High School to placate her parents. In 1973 she gave a candid interview for the short-lived Los Angeles-based Star Magazine, and boasted to the journalist that she considered herself to be \\"the best\\" of all the local groupies. She also claimed that she was closely acquainted with some of rock music's leading musicians, such as Jeff Beck, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Marc Bolan, and Alice Cooper. She added that her favorite rock star acquaintance was Led Zeppelin's lead singer, Robert Plant. When asked how she attracted the attention of the musicians, she maintained it was because of the outrageous glam rock clothing she habitually wore. She was often photographed alongside well-known rock musicians; these photos appeared in American rock magazines such as Creem and Rock Scene. Starr admitted to having gotten into fights with rival groupies and she allegedly had a confrontation with Bianca Jagger, who at the time was married to Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger. According to Starr, she knocked on Bianca's hotel room and when the latter opened the door she was told \\"in a few four-letter words to 'get lost'\\". Lori Mattix, a fellow baby groupie, claimed that Starr once told her to \\"keep her hands\\" off of Jimmy Page, saying \\"if you touch him, I will shoot you. He‚Äôs mine.‚Äù Her closest friends in Los Angeles were fellow groupies Shray Mecham and \\"Queenie\\". Model Bebe Buell described Starr as having been one of the two top Los Angeles groupies of the era, adding that \\"every rock star who came to Los Angeles wanted to meet her\\". She ran away from home when she was 16 after meeting Johnny Thunders, guitarist in the glam rock band the New York Dolls.McNeil, Legs, McCain, Gillian (1996). Please Kill Me: the Uncensored Oral History of Punk. New York: Grove Press. p.150-151 She went to live with him in New York City. Their relationship didn't last, mainly due to his violent jealousy and drug addiction. He had wanted to marry her after she became pregnant with his child, but she refused and instead had an abortion. Tired of the physical abuse Thunders often inflicted upon her, and unable to adjust to the New York lifestyle, Starr moved back to Los Angeles. She claimed that \\"he [Thunders] tried to destroy my personality. After I was with him, I just wasn't Sable Starr anymore. He really destroyed the Sable Starr thing\\". She made frequent visits to New York where she had an affair with Richard Hell, befriended Nancy Spungen, and participated in the local burgeoning punk rock scene. By the early 1980s, she was no longer part of the groupie milieu. Later years and death She later moved to Lake Tahoe, Nevada. She became a table game dealer at Carson Valley Inn in Minden until shortly before her death. Starr died at her home in Nevada on April 18, 2009 of brain cancer at the age of 51. She was survived by her partner, her daughter, and her son.

Cold North Wind Inc. is the parent company of Paperofrecord.com, which was founded by R. J. Huggins of Ottawa Canada in 2001.  History  Cold North Wind, Inc. (CNW) was created in 1999 to digitize archived newspapers and place them online for use by libraries and consumers.PaperofRecord.com Completes Sale of Digital Newspaper Archives to Google IT News Talk, retrieved Dec 3, 2008 The site is accessible by fee-paying members, and contains over 21 million archived newspaper images from several countries. The idea for the site was conceived in 2001 at a Mexican restaurant in Ottawa by R.J. (Bob) Huggins and others at Cold North Wind. The site carriers digitized newspapers from the United States, Mexico and Europe, including newspapers from cities and small towns.All the News That's Fit to Scan The company digitized microfilm newspaper article images, for online access from a computer, and eventually automated the process. Cold North Wind asserts that it was the first company in the world to digitize an entire newspaper's history, beginning with the Toronto Star and its 110-year collection of back issues, which the company says was \\"archived in less than four months\\". Following this, the same process was used to archive The Globe and Mail. In 2006 Google along with the shareholders of Cold North Wind, Inc. reached an agreement to privately sell POR to Google. The sale remained confidential until 2008 when the news was then publicly announced. The sale was seen as a positive step for POR due to Google's large scale and resources. Google News offers a news archive search independently; however, the addition of the archived material found on POR broadened the scope of their archives.  Features  CNW worked with the National Archives of Canada and created an online archive featuring portions of former prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King's diaries, as well as working toward an online version of the Canadian Historical Dictionary. Genealogy is one of the applied uses of POR, as are sports media and author publication.

Books such as the Reference sources in history: An introductory guide, Chocolate: history, culture, and heritage, Ontario‚Äôs African-Canadian heritage: collected writings by Fred Landon, 1918‚Äì1967 use the site as primary sources for historical and genealogical purposes. The Washington Star, which has been out of circulation since 1981 ending its 130-year-long run, has also now been archived on POR.

It broadcasts from Ludington, Michigan. It airs Westwood One's Good Time Oldies format and can be heard in a very small area around Ludington and Scottville. In late 2013 and early 2014, WKLA added two FM translators to extend its reach, 92.7 W224CA in Ludington (formerly a rebroadcaster of sister station WWKR) and 107.9 W300CG in Manistee (which has since moved to a different frequency and is simulcasting WKLA's sister station WMLQ). 92.7 covers a larger coverage area than 1450 AM. WKLA is also the home of Manistee Chippewas football and basketball despite the 1450 signal not reaching Manistee itself. As of September 2016, the station is airing the news/talk programming of sister station WLDN 98.7 FM on an assumed temporary basis pending retuning and installation of a new antenna for WLDN, as the latter's previous antenna was used to put WKLA-FM on the air on 96.3. In February 2017, WLDN returned to the air on 98.7 FM, allowing WKLA and W224CA to resume the oldies format. History The AM station went on the air on October 8, 1944, originally housed on the second floor of the Masonic Temple in downtown Ludington. Karl L. Ashbacher was the original owner, with his initials being the original basis for the call letters. (Previously the family had operated WKBZ in Ludington from 1926 to 1934, moving it to Muskegon, Michigan in the latter year.) In 1945 the WKLA studio moved to the Ludington Chamber of Commerce office at 204 E. Ludington Avenue. Raymond A. Plank purchased the station in 1949. In 1951, the station was moved to its current site at 5941 W. US 10 in Ludington. In 1971, WKLA expanded its programming with WKLA-FM. Programming on WKLA for many years consisted of full service MOR programming and adult standards. WKLA-FM spent much of its programming day simulcasting the AM signal before introducing a separate adult contemporary format around 1980, which it has retained since. Talk programming was introduced in the late 1990s, and the station soon went all talk prior to the switch to oldies in 2010. Other past owners of WKLA include Tom Plank and Chickering & Associates. In 1996, the station was purchased by Roger Baerwolf under the corporate name of Lake Michigan Broadcasting, Inc. Until July 2012, the company owned and operated WKLA AM/FM, WMTE AM/FM (Manistee) and WKZC-FM (Scottville). In June 2012, it was announced that Lake Michigan Broadcasting was selling all of its Ludington/Manistee stations to Synergy Media, which already owned and operated WWKR in Hart and WMLQ in Manistee. Synergy assumed control of the stations the following month and began simulcasting WKLA's programming on WMTE-FM. On June 19, 2013, the licenses involved were transferred to Synergy Media at a price of $580,000. Former translator W300CG now operates on 107.7 FM as W299CB, rebroadcasting sister station WWMN.

He is primarily known as a Rabindrasangeet artiste although he had recorded a few Bengali modern songs as well.  Career  Sagar Sen made an entry into the world of Rabindrasangeet in the early 1960s. It was an era when stalwarts like Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Debabrata Biswas and Chinmoy Chattopadhyay were highly established and extremely popular. However, his unique attributes like his melodious baritone voice, attention to the minute details and the most appropriate emotional delivery and style required for the rendition of songs composed by Rabindranath Tagore appealed to the masses on a large scale. Sagar Sen's first recording with All India Radio was in the year 1958. Thereafter, he started performing as a Rabindrasangeet singer at Akashvani, Kolkata. He participated in the recordings of Tagore's operas namely, Shap Mochan (1966) and Valmiki Pratibha (1967) under the direction of Santosh Sengupta. However, the big breakthrough came in 1968 with the recording of the song 'Ami Jene Shune Bish Korechhi Paan', a song from Tagore's opera 'Mayar Khela', which played a great role in establishing him as a very coveted artiste of Rabindrasangeet. Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s he recorded numerous songs with the erstwhile Gramophone Company of India Ltd. The year 1974 saw the release of his first stereophonic Long Play (LP) record, which comprised 14 songs of Tagore, 7 each from 'Puja' (Devotional) and 'Prem' (Love) category. He founded a musical institution in Kolkata named 'Rabi Rashmi' where students learned Rabindrasangeet under his tutelage. 'Rabi Rashmi' was extremely popular in its times and was also known for its regular performance of various concerts like 'Shraban Sandhya (An Evening of Shravana)', 'Shapmochan (Tagore's Opera)‚Äô, 'Rituranga (Seasons' Varieties)', 'Gaaner Jharnatalay (Under the Fountain of Songs)', 'Swadeshi Neye Bideshi Kheya (Tagore's Songs from Western Tunes)', 'Bishwajana Mohichhey (The World is Spellbound)' organised at prestigious venues in Kolkata like Rabindra Sadan, Sisir Mancha and Kala Mandir . Such concerts were organised by Sagar Sen and performed by his students as well as himself and other famous artistes like Hemanta Mukhopadhyay, Chinmoy Chattopadhyay, Suchitra Mitra and Bani Thakur. In August 1975, the inaugural session and opening ceremony of the Kolkata Doordarshan was initiated by Sagar Sen along with Sumitra Sen, another renowned artiste of that time.  Style  His style of rendition appealed to every dedicated listener of the genre through its simplicity which succeeded in the manifestation of sublime realization. His uniqueness lay in the fact that he gave extreme importance to the minute details of the notations. His songs exhibit the perfect blend of the emotional delivery (which is a unique attribute of Rabindrasangeet) and technical perfection.  Modern songs and playback  Sagar Sen performed as a playback artiste notably in the Bengali movies Je Jekhane Dnariye (1974), and Parichay (1979) and also in movies like Abirbhab and Mantramugdha. He received a BFJA Award in 1979 for the song 'Aj Jyotsnaratey Sobai Gechhe Boney' in the movie Parichay. He also sang a few modern Bengali songs like 'Ei Jibon Emni Kore Ar To Soy Na' and 'Ki Holo Chand Keno Meghe Dheke Gelo' in 1980 and a duet with Sabita Chowdhury 'Trishito Nayane Eso' all composed by the maestro composer, Salil Chowdhury.  Personal life and death  Sagar Sen was born in 1932 in Faridpur, Bangladesh (disputed Baranagar, Calcutta). However, he was primarily based in Kolkata, throughout his musical career. In 1981, he was diagnosed with cancer. Despite this diagnosis, he continued recording and performing in concerts in high spirits, throughout the last one and a half years of his life. He died on 4 January 1983, at the age of 50. He was survived by his wife and three sons, Priyam Sen, Pritam Sen and Promit Sen. Promit Sen has established himself as a renowned Rabindrasangeet artiste and continues to sing today. Until their divorce, he was married to notable actress Swastika Mukherjee.

Adams was accompanied by his young son Michael and his best friend Cedric Wright on a long road trip around the west. They came upon the scene while traveling through the Chama River valley toward Espa√±ola in late afternoon on November 1 (see section \\"Dating\\", below); accounts of what transpired differ considerably. An example of a Weston exposure meter. An average light reading is obtained from the device and the arrow on the circular panel is rotated across the value, yielding a range of aperture and shutter speed combinations that would properly expose the scene. The initial publication of Moonrise was at the end of 1942, with a two-page image in U.S. Camera Annual 1943, having being selected by the \\"photo judge\\" of U.S. Camera, Edward Steichen. In that publication, Adams gave this account: Adams' later accounts were more dramatic. In his autobiography, completed by his assistant and editor Mary Alinder shortly after his 1984 death, the traveling companions encountered a \\"fantastic scene\\", a church and cemetery near Hernandez, New Mexico, and pulled to the side of the road. Adams recalled that he yelled at his son Michael and at Wright to \\"Get this! Get that, for God's sake! We don't have much time!\\" Desperate to capture the image in the fading light, they scrambled to set up the tripod and camera, knowing that only moments remained before the light was gone. Adams had given a similar account in his 1983 book Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs Dating the image Beaumont Newhall, a photographer, curator and friend of Adams, was curious that Adams did not know the date of the photograph. While Adams remembered that the photograph was taken in the autumn, he had variously given the year as 1940, 1941, 1942, and‚Äîdespite the picture having been published in 1943‚Äî1944. Newhall wondered if the astronomical information in the photograph could provide the answer, so he approached David Elmore of the High Altitude Observatory in Boulder, Colorado. Focusing on the autumn months of 1941 through 1944, Elmore found 36 plausible dates for the image. Elmore determined a probable location and direction for the camera alongside the highway. Using that location information, he then plotted the Moon's apparent position on his computer screen for those dates to find a match. Elmore concluded that Moonrise was taken on October 31, 1941, at 4:03 p.m. Adams thanked Elmore for determining the date and used that date in several subsequent publications, including his 1983 book Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs that used the date but rounded the time to 4:05 p.m. Dennis di Cicco of Sky & Telescope magazine read about Elmore's results and tried verifying them. Di Cicco entered the position, direction, and time into a program that displayed the Moon's position, but the resulting position did not match the Moonrise image. Di Cicco was intrigued by the discrepancy. Working off and on over the next ten years, including a visit to the location, Di Cicco concluded in 1991 \\"that Adams had been at the edge of the old roadbed, about 50 feet west of the spot on the modern highway that Elmore had identified\\".Portions of the old highway are still visible on Google Maps. Di Cicco's calculations determined that the image was taken at 4:49:20 p.m. on November 1, 1941. He reviewed his calculations with Elmore, who agreed with Di Cicco's result. Elmore had been misled by his computer monitor's distortion with an additional slight discrepancy in Adams' coordinates. In 1981, the IBM PC's CGA display did not have a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio; plotting software would have to compensate for that aspect ratio to make an isotropic plot.

Founded in 1919 as an Orthodox Jewish congregation, the members purchased their current building‚Äîa former church‚Äîin 1920, and renovated it in 1926. Following World War II the congregation declined. The members considered selling the building in the 1970s, but a campaign to save it led to its receiving much needed repairs, and the 1982 designation of the building as a site of historical importance by the City of Toronto. An influx of younger, more liberal families, led to the congregation becoming an unaffiliated egalitarian Conservative synagogue. Early history The Beach Hebrew Institute was founded in 1919 by Jewish residents in The Beaches neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which was then a largely Anglo- Saxon area in the east part of Toronto far removed from the Jewish neighbourhoods further to the west in The Ward and around Spadina Avenue.\\"A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BEACH HEBREW INSTITUTE\\" , Beach Hebrew Institute website. Accessed July 23, 2011. The forty or so Jewish families living in The Beaches at the time tended to be more prosperous and had either been born in Canada or immigrated at an early age and so spoke English as their first language, compared to the Yiddish speaking, impoverished, recent immigrants who predominated in the city's main Jewish neighbourhoods. Many of them either owned local shops in the area or summer homes.\\"Beach Hebrew Institute ‚Äì Early History\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives. $1,500 (today $) was raised towards the purchase or construction of a synagogue building and, in 1920, the old Kenilworth Avenue Baptist Church, originally built in 1895, at 109 Kenilworth Avenue (at Queen Street) was acquired with a $4,500 (today $) mortgage. In 1926, the synagogue was renovated; a new facade was added, electrical features were installed, an upstairs gallery was installed to serve as a school, and a new basement layout provided more space. The red brick front facade was built to make the building look less like a church and more like a synagogue. It features a round top, a large Star of David, and five stained glass windows.\\"Beach Hebrew Institute ‚Äì Architecture\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives. The Beach Hebrew Institute was located in not only a largely Anglo-Saxon area, but also one that in the 1930s exhibited antisemitism with the creation of \\"Swastika Clubs\\" that organized anti-Jewish marches, and signs on the Boardwalk reading \\"No Dogs or Jews Allowed\\". It therefore tried to maintain a low, inconspicuous profile, and its unconventional name, which avoided using the word \\"synagogue\\", was \\"due to the lack of Jews in the area, as well as the anti-Semitic atmosphere at some points.\\"Lorraine O'Donnell Williams (2010).

Post World War II The synagogue remained popular until after World War II when many of the congregants followed much of the rest of Toronto's Jewish community as it migrated north up Bathurst Street to Forest Hill and further north. The decline in membership forced the synagogue to cancel its Hebrew and Sunday schools and disband the Beach Sisterhood. However, there was a brief revival caused by a new wave of Jewish families in the 1950s, followed by two decades of further decline. By the 1970s, older members considered selling the building until an influx of young more liberal Jewish families moving into the neighbourhood, some of whom were intermarried couples or recent converts, led to the synagogue's revitalization.\\"Beach Hebrew Institute ‚Äì Restoration\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives. A major campaign to raise money to restore the synagogue was conducted including charity auctions, bazaars and the involvement of high-profile politicians such as the mayor and Members of Parliament. Media interest followed as well as the 1982 designation of the building as a site of historical importance by the City of Toronto. The congregation's fundraising goal was met resulting in needed repairs to the walls, plumbing and furnace as well as the renovation of the basement to enable it to operate as a function hall. Originally Orthodox, the congregation is now unaffiliated and egalitarian, and describes itself as \\"liberal Conservative\\"\\"Beach Hebrew Institute ‚Äì The Synagogue Today\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives.\\"Beach Hebrew Institute ‚Äì Religion\\", Toronto's First Synagogues, Ontario Jewish Archives. or \\"Conservative egalitarian\\".

Early political career Zambito was a Progressive Conservative Party of Quebec candidate in the 1985 provincial election, running in the Montreal division of Dorion. He focused his campaign on subsidized housing, community services for the elderly, and improved services at the city's Jean Talon Hospital. The Progressive Conservatives did not have a strong provincial base in Quebec, and Zambito finished fourth against Liberal Violette Tr√©panier on election day.David Wimhurst, \\"Dorion: Three candidates feel they can win riding,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 November 1985, A7; \\"How the province voted, riding-by- riding,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 December 1985, C6. Zambito was narrowly elected to the Saint-Leonard city council in the 1986 municipal election, winning as a Ralliement de Saint-L√©onard (RdSL) candidate in the city's twelfth ward.Debbie Parkes, \\"Renaud wipes out St. Leonard opposition,\\" Montreal Gazette, 3 November 1986, A8. The RdSL won a majority on council, and Zambito initially supported mayor Raymond Renaud. In May 1988, Zambito and seven other councillors, led by Frank Zampino, charged that Renaud's administration was undemocratic and resigned from the party to sit as independents.Amorell Saunders, \\"Eight St. Leonard city councillors quit mayor's 'undemocratic' party,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 May 1988, A3. Frank Zampino later consolidated the rebel group as the Parti municipal and was elected as Saint-Leonard's mayor in the 1990 municipal election. Zambito was re-elected to council as a Parti municipal candidate in 1990, 1994 and 1998.Mike King, \\"Zampino, 8 councillors acclaimed in St. Leonard,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 October 1994, A6; Irwin Block, \\"Second acclamation in a row for Zampino,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 October 1998, A6. Post-amalgamation All municipalities on the Island of Montreal were amalgamated into a single government in 2001, and Saint-Leonard became part of the new city of Montreal. Zambito was elected to the Saint-Leonard borough council in the 2001 municipal election as a candidate of the Montreal Island Citizens Union, which was later renamed as Union Montreal.John MacFarlane and Angus Loten, \\"'We showed who's boss': Team Tremblay captures the east,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 November 2001, A7. He was re-elected in 2005 and was elected to a seat on the Montreal city council in the 2009 municipal election. In 2003 Zambito was up for re-election in St-Leonard and joined newly formed political party Equipe Coderre after his former party Union Montreal, under the former Mayor Gerald Tremblay, applied for dissolution after several raids were conducted by Montreal's anti-corruption squad (UPAC) and an investigation by the Charbonneau Commission. Denis Coderre, mayoral candidate and party leader, removed Zambito from his party after Radio-Canada's investigative program Enqu√™te, was planning to report that he had profited from a land deal by taking advantage of his position on council. Amidst allegations of a kick- back scheme Zambito dropped out of politics and is now working as a real- estate broker for Keller-Williams. Italian politics Zambito ran for the Italian Senate in that country's 2006 general election, as a candidate of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in an overseas Senate division reserved for Italian voters in North America and Central America.Jeff Heinrich, \\"When in St. Leonard, do as the Romans,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 March 2006, A3. He appeared on the ballot as \\"Liborio Zambito.\\" Berlusconi's list was defeated by Romano Prodi's coalition, known as The Union. Zambito subsequently broke with Berlusconi's party and sought election to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2013 Italian general election as a candidate of Mario Monti's With Monti for Italy coalition. Although Monti's list received enough votes for one regional seat, Zambito did not place first in the list's candidate preference votes and was once again not elected.

Avoid sites with excessive frost. A sunny situation is preferred, though it does better with a small amount of shade. Fertilizers may be used, but only recommended if they have a low pH (higher acid) levels. This plant strikes easily from tip cuttings. Alternatively, seed propagation is also successful. Seeds may be treated by very hot (but not boiling) water for two minutes. After drying overnight, they should be planted and placed in a sunny situation. Germination usually occurs within two weeks.

It is a pastoral improvisation recorded by Evans at the end of the recording session and is one of his simplest, built on a gentle Cmaj7 to G9sus4 two chord progression, the same first chords of \\"Some Other Time\\" from the musical On the Town by Leonard Bernstein which Evans also recorded. The same progression featured in the opening to \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" which he recorded with Miles Davis the following year; Davis took a liking to the piece and wanted to reuse it. Although a peaceful piece, it features a lot of discordant notes in the latter half. The composition, with its free form peaceful melody and timeless, meditational quality, has featured in numerous soundtracks of films and music in ballet choreography and has been recorded by fellow jazz musicians. It featured in Bo Widerberg's Love 65 (1965), Gaurav Seth's A Passage to Ottawa, Philip Seymour Hoffman's Jack Goes Boating (2010), and Dan Gilroy's Roman J. Israel, Esq. (2017). Pianists Richie Beirach, Ricardo Fioravanti, Liz Story and Stefano Battaglia, the guitarists Stephen D. Anderson and Nino Josele, flautist Herbie Mann, and classical pianist Jean- Yves Thibaudet have all recorded Peace Piece. The Kronos Quartet also recorded Peace Piece as a string quartet on the album Music of Bill Evans with Eddie G√≥mez on bass and Jim Hall accompanying on guitar. Evans evokes the feeling of being alone in the piece and recalled that a teenage fan said that when he first heard it he \\"felt like he was standing all alone in New York\\". Evans had many requests to play the piece live in his last years but he refused because he believed that the composition would lose its value and meaning as it had been an inspiration at the moment only. He only ever played it once live with the Bill Evans Dance Company in Seattle in 1978 to accompany an abstract and lyrical modern dance put on by the dancers. Chuck Israels, later a bassist of the Bill Evans Trio, speaking of Peace Piece on his website: > Peace Piece is an example of the depth of Evans' compositional technique. It > is an ostinato piece, composed and recorded long before the more recent > superficial synthesis of Indian and American music; in fact, it owes more to > Satie and Debussy than to Ravi Shankar. The improvisation starts simply over > a gentle ostinato, which quickly fades into the background. Evans allows the > fantasy that evolves from the opening motive (an inversion of the descending > fifth in the ostinato) more freedom than he would in an improvisation tied > to a changing accompaniment. He takes advantage of the ostinato as a > unifying element against which ideas flower, growing more lush and colorful > as the piece unfolds. Polytonalities and cross rhythms increase in density > as the ostinato undulates gently, providing a central rhythmic and tonal > reference. The improvisation becomes increasingly complex against the > unrelenting simplicity of the accompaniment, until, near the end, Evans > gradually reconciles the two elements.\\" Jacques R√©da, a poet and jazz critic, has written a poem in French about Peace Piece. Peace Piece bears some resemblance to Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Berceuse in Db major; both pieces use a two-chord left-hand ostinato throughout, and they both have an ornamented melody line.  In films The piece has been used in several films, including Corrina, Corrina in 1994 (performed by John Beasley), Peace Is Every Step in 1997 (Bill Evans version), Jack Goes Boating in 2010 (Bill Evans version), and Roman J.

It was the final aircraft designed by Burt Rutan prior to his retirement. Development The Bipod was originally designed to be an electric propulsion testbed, later evolving into the flying car concept. The vehicle was constructed for market evaluation and testing only. No flight testing was planned, or done, on the single prototype built. Design The BiPod uses twin fuselages with tandem wheels joined together by a wing surface. The wings, stabilizers and tail tips are removable for road operations. The left cockpit is configured for road operations (i.e. it is driven as a car from the left-hand station), the right cockpit is configured for air operations (i.e. it is flown from the right-hand station). The wingspan of nearly 32 feet (9.7 m) is reduced to 7.9 feet (2.4 m) when the wings are removed (they can be carried between the two fuselage sections during road operation). Thus the vehicle can be parked in a regular-sized garage stall when the wings and tail surfaces have been removed. Propulsion Each fuselage section has a 450cc gasoline engine, which drives an electric generator. The generators power 15 kW electric motors; two such motors drive the rear wheels for land use, and four such motors drive four propellers (two on the horizontal stabilizer and two on the wings).\\"The use of electric power transmission decouples engine location from propeller location without the need for mechanical shafts and gear boxes, enabling BiPod's unique geometry.\\" (Scaled Composites press release, reported in Flying) Although not installed to date (July 2011), the testbed configuration will eventually incorporate rechargeable lithium batteries for additional power during takeoff or for extra climb performance.Pia Bergqvist, Rutan's Swan Song: A Flying Car, Flying, September 2011, p. 20. In addition, as of the first flight the propellers and propeller drive motors had not been installed; the \\"flights\\" consisted of brief hops above a runway after the drive wheels had been used to accelerate the vehicle to .

The water forms a tunnel after reaching the bottom. This tunnel is approximately long and runs below ground level. On 31 July 1961, a Swiss couple went swimming but the woman drowned in a pit because of the overflow. Her body was recovered 3 days later in river Phusre with great effort. Her father wished to name it \\"David's falls\\" after her but changed to Devi's Fall. Its Nepali name is Patale Chango, which means \\"underworld waterfall\\". This is one of the most visited places in Nepal. After exiting the tunnel, the water passes through a cave called Gupteshwor Mahadev Cave or \\"cave beneath the ground\\".

Independent cities are classified by the United States Census Bureau as \\"county equivalents\\", and may also have similar governmental powers as a consolidated city-county. However in the case of a consolidated city-county, a city and a county were merged into a unified jurisdiction in which the county at least nominally exists to this day, whereas an independent city was legally separated from any county or merged with a county that simultaneously ceased to exist even in name. Of the 41 independent U.S. cities, 38 are in Virginia, whose state constitution makes them a special case. The three independent cities outside Virginia are Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis, Missouri; and Carson City, Nevada. The most populous of them is Baltimore, Maryland. Virginia Top 10 most populated cities in Virginia (2010). History In the Commonwealth of Virginia, all municipalities incorporated as \\"cities\\" have been \\"independent cities\\", also called \\"free cities\\", since 1871, when a revised state constitution took effect following the American Civil War and the creation of West Virginia. Virginia's thirty-eight independent cities are not politically part of a county, even though geographically they may be completely surrounded by one. An independent city in Virginia may serve as the county seat of an adjacent county, even though the city by definition is not part of that county. Some other Virginia municipalities, even though they may be more populous than some existing independent cities, are incorporated towns. These towns always form part of a county. Incorporated towns have limited powers, varying by each charter. They typically share many aspects such as courts and public school divisions with the county they are within. In the Commonwealth of Virginia, there are two classes of city. The primary difference relates to the court system. A first-class city (e.g., Richmond) has its own District Court and also its own Circuit Court. A second-class city (e.g. Norton or Emporia) has its own District Courts, but not its own Circuit Court. As a second-class city, Fairfax shares a Circuit Court with Fairfax County, while Falls Church shares a Circuit Court with adjacent Arlington County. In Virginia, a District Court is not a court of record, so all cases are heard by a judge; all jury trials are heard in a Circuit Court. Three older Virginia counties, whose origins go back to the original eight shires of Virginia formed in 1634 in the Colony of Virginia, have or had the word city in their names; politically, however, they are counties. The independent cities were formed to centralize trading and legal matters as the older system of merchant ships cruising from plantation to plantation was inefficient. The colonial capital of Williamsburg was created for this reason, being a port for the James River. Two of these counties are Charles City County and James City County, whose names originated with earlier \\"incorporations\\" created in 1619 by the Virginia Company as Charles Cittie and James Cittie. Another was Elizabeth City County, originally part of the older Elizabeth Cittie, which became extinct in 1952 when it was consolidated politically by mutual consent with the small City of Hampton, the county seat, and the Town of Phoebus to reform and expand into the current independent city of Hampton, Virginia, one of the large cities of Virginia. Former cities Former independent cities, now extinct, that were long extant in Virginia include: * Bedford, which gave up its city charter in 2013, and is now an incorporated town in Bedford County. * Clifton Forge, which gave up its city charter in 2001, and is now an incorporated town in Alleghany County. * Manchester, which was consolidated by mutual agreement with the City of Richmond in 1910. * South Boston, which gave up its city charter in 1994, and is now an incorporated town in Halifax County. * South Norfolk, which merged with Norfolk County in 1963 to form the City of Chesapeake. Two other independent cities existed only for a short time: * Nansemond, created from the former Nansemond County in 1972, was merged in 1974 with the then-City of Suffolk and three unincorporated towns within the county's former boundaries, to form today's City of Suffolk. * Warwick, which was formed from the former Warwick County in 1952, was in 1958 consolidated by mutual agreement with the newly expanded City of Newport News. Other states Some states have created independent cities in order to cater to the special requirements of governing their largest cities and/or capitals: * The City of Baltimore has been separate from Baltimore County, Maryland since 1851. * Carson City, Nevada consolidated with Ormsby County in 1969. Ormsby County was simultaneously dissolved. * The City of St. Louis was separated from St. Louis County, Missouri in 1876. Other entities similar to independent cities An independent city is not the same as: * A consolidated city-county (such as San Francisco, Philadelphia, or Denver), in which the city and county (or, as in Louisiana, a parish; or as in Alaska, a borough) governments have been merged (in some cases, the city takes up all the land within the county's boundaries, while in other cases, several other independent incorporated communities exist). A consolidated city-county differs from an independent city in that the city and county both nominally exist, although they have a consolidated government, whereas in an independent city, the county does not even nominally exist.Cities 101 -- Consolidations, from National League of Cities * A county such as Arlington County, Virginia that is completely urbanized but only contains unincorporated communities, no incorporated cities or municipalities. * A \\"Federated\\" City-County multi- tiered type of government such as applies between Miami and Miami-Dade County, Florida. * The City of New York, which is a sui generis jurisdiction: the city is made up of five boroughs, each of which is territorially coterminous with a county of New York State. * Washington, D.C., which has a special status as the U.S. capital. It is not part of any state; instead the District of Columbia is under the jurisdiction of the Congress of the United States in accordance with Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. The District was originally divided into three independent cities and two counties. Alexandria County (which now forms Arlington County) and the independent city of Alexandria were returned to Virginia in 1846. The three remaining entities (the City of Washington, Georgetown, and Washington County) were merged into a consolidated government by an act of Congress in 1871. Congress has established a home rule government for the city, although city laws can be overridden by Congress. In practice, the city operates much like other independent cities in the United States. * Cities and towns in New England traditionally have very strong governments, while counties have correspondingly less importance. Today, most counties in southern New England (Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts) have almost no governmental institutions or roles associated with them (aside from serving as a basis for court districts, along with demarcating National Weather Service warnings and media markets). Counties in southern New England still have a nominal existence, and so no city or town in those three states is truly separate from a county, although the town and the county of Nantucket, Massachusetts (on the island of that name), are coterminous, and the City of Boston used to provide both the complete governance and the complete revenue of its county, Suffolk County, although Suffolk County also includes three much smaller cities. * Cities and towns in the Unorganized Borough of Alaska. Alaska is not divided into counties, but has near-equivalents called boroughs. However, unlike county-equivalents in the other 49 states, the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state. The area not territory of any borough is referred to as the Unorganized Borough, although it does not have its own local government. The Census Bureau divides the Unorganized Borough into several census areas which it treats as county equivalents for statistical purposes.

Claudiana) The Virgin Mary: The Roman Catholic Marian Doctrine is the English title of Italian Protestant theologian Giovanni Miegge's 1950 work La vergine Maria: Saggio di storia del dogma. In the original Italian language it has gone through four printings, the most recent in 2008. Overview The book presents, in chronological order, the development of Roman Catholic Mariology. It is primarily a critique from a Protestant viewpoint of Gabriel Roschini's 1947‚Äì8 Mariologia. It touches on a variety of doctrinal points, including the idea of the perpetual virginity of Mary, then turns to the uses of terms referring to Mary, including \\"Mother of God\\" and \\"Queen of Heaven\\". Georges A. Barrois of Princeton Theological Seminary sees it as an attempt to find out the time and place when Roman Catholic doctrine \\"became inconsistent with the spirit or with the patterns of thought of original Christianity\\". Translations The book was translated into English by Waldo Smith, with an added foreword by John A. Mackay, and published in 1956 by Westminster Press. Reviewers present differing viewpoints on the quality of Smith's translation. Robert M. Grant of the University of Chicago praised it, with the exception of minor errors such as the plural \\"apocrypha\\" where singular \\"apocryphon\\" should be used instead, and referring to the Society of Jesus as the \\"Company of Jesus\\". However, Eamon Carroll of The Catholic University of America was much more critical, describing it as \\"full of failures to express the sense of the Italian at all\\". In particular he criticises a passage in which a declarative statement of Saint Leo the Great (Pope Leo I) was made into an interrogative in translation, completely inverting the meaning, and the frequent mistranslations by way of false friends. The French translation, by Jacqueline Tadjer-Orenpo, was published in 1961. Reviews Miegge comes in for criticism from Barrois for his scriptural exegesis, particularly in his interpretation of Mark 3: 31‚Äì35 and John 19: 25‚Äì27, where he states that Mary is \\"rebuked\\" by Jesus. Similarly, Miegge argues that Roman Catholic theologians \\"read too much\\" into the words of the angel Gabriel to Mary in Luke 1: 28 (the Annunciation), an assessment with which Barrois agrees; however, Barrois also states that Miegge seems to put too little weight on these words. Carroll, himself a Catholic who admits that he is disposed to disagree with Miegge's analysis, praises the clarity with which Miegge analyses Catholic and Protestant differences in their conception of Christianity, but evaluated his description of Catholic Marian belief and practise as \\"often far removed from reality\\". It was also reviewed in the International Review of Mission and The New York Times. Editions *. **Second edition 1959. . **Third edition 1982, with preface by Alfredo Sonelli. . *. *. *. *.

A train of the Circumvesuviana line, a local railway providing transport in the area around the Mount Vesuvius, derailed between the San Giorgio a Cremano and Naples stations. The accident led to a single fatality, seventy-one-year-old Giuseppe Marotta, who lost his legs in the wreck and died shortly after arriving at Loreto Mare hospital. Among the fifty-eight injured, a twenty-five-year-old man entered a coma, and a woman had to be treated for severe wounds of the thorax and head. Eleven other people had severe wounds and had to be hospitalized. Derailment An ETR 200 Metrostar The train was traveling on a junction shared between the Circumvesuviana service and a Naples subway route from San Giorgio a Cremano to Naples. The rolling stock involved was an ETR 200 Metrostar, one of the latest acquisitions from the Circumvesuviana administration, just one year old and with a perfect maintenance record. At 11:10, after leaving the Centro Direzionale station, the train left the rails and hit a wall at the rail-side. The three permanently joined passenger-cars overturned, and the engine hit an electricity pole. The first car was crushed under the second one. First aid was provided by workers from a nearby factory to a man with crushed legs: they used their belts to stop blood loss, but the man died shortly after being transported to the nearest hospital. Medics of Loreto Mare hospital were on strike (due to salary conditions), but suspended the protest to provide first aid to the injured passengers. While people promptly called the 118 medical emergency number, response from ambulances was slow, taking more than twenty minutes to bring the fifteen ambulances required to transport the injured from the disaster scene. Twenty technician and three cranes from Protezione Civile later joined the rescue operations. Causes The main cause of the accident was excessive speed. Apparently the train was travelling at twice the maximum allowed speed, in a section where the speed limit was just 20 km/h. The train driver, Giancarlo Naso, said he did not remember anything from the moments before the accident, and appeared confused to the police officers who eventually got him into custody. He was an experienced driver, with twenty years experience on the line.http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2010/08/06/news/napoli_deraglia_la_circumvesuviana-6117070/ One witness, a nineteen-year-old passenger named Patrizio Straiano, said the driver was talking on his mobile phone shortly before the crash, and he could have missed the speed limit signal. The driver had fled the scene of the accident after the train derailed.http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/Cronaca/2010/8/6/DERAGLIAMENTO- CIRCUMVESUVIANA-Video-Un-testimone-Il-macchinista-stava-parlando-al- cellulare/104778/ Maintenance work to provide structural reinforcement to the side walls had been completed three days before the accident, but allegations that the line had structural problems and reports of anomalies were dismissed. Although the train was equipped with an automatic speed control system, the required rail components were not installed. Local newspapers blamed the accident on cost cutting and bad maintenance by Circumvesuviana, and on the privatization of local mass-transport services.http://www.ecostiera.it/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=3819&Itemid;=74 Aftermath The derailment caused severe damage to the railway infrastructure. Local service was provided using buses for a number of weeks afterwards. Other incidents Circumvesuviana had been involved in two previous accidents. On 6 December 1992 a switch malfunction, instigated by bad weather, caused a derailment. On 22 January 2009 a tree toppled by the wind hit the overhead electric wires and fell onto a train passing below. The train driver and guard were severely injured, but ultimately recovered.

The other work by Xenophon on horsemanship is ', Per√¨ hippikƒìs, usually translated as On horsemanship, De equis alendis or The Art of Horsemanship. The title De re equestri may refer to either one of the two works. Hipparchicus deals mainly with the duties of the cavalry commander (hipparchus), while On horsemanship deals with the selection, care and training of horses in general.  History  The treatises of Xenophon were written in about 350 BC, and were considered the earliest extant works on horsemanship in any literature until the publication by Bed≈ôich Hrozn√Ω in 1931 of a Hittite text, that by Kikkuli of the Mitanni Kingdom, which dates from about 1360 BC. A treatise on horsemanship by Pliny the Elder is believed lost, as was that by Simon of Athens, which is twice mentioned by Xenophon in On horsemanship. Some fragments of Simon's treatise survive, however; they were published by Franz R√ºhl in 1912.

This murder, which occurred during a raggin incident, led to the passing of the first anti-ragging legislation in India. Details Pon Navarasu was a first year student at the Rajah Muthiah Medical College, Annamalai University. He was murdered on 6 November 1996. His body was dismembered and the body parts were scattered in different parts of Tamil Nadu. They were recovered over the next few days. His father Prof. P. K. Ponnusamy, a former vice-chancellor of the Madras University, filed a police complaint on 10 November The next day John David. a senior student at the same college surrendered to judicial custody and confessed to the murder after a week-long interrogation. According to his confession, the murder took place while he was ragging Navarasu. The police said that David had assaulted Navarasu during a ragging session in his hostel room as the latter refused to strip and lick footwear. David's college mates testified that he had a reputation for being a bully and humiliating freshers. Delivering the much-awaited judgement in a packed court hall, a Cuddalore judge S.R. Singaravelu said the motive of the murder was probably, 'that while other juniors had obliged the accused, the disinclination of Navarasu, who happened to be the son of a vice-chancellor, might have irritated the accused and made him desperate and led to an ego clash.' The gruesome nature of the murder caused a public outcry and the Tamil Nadu government passed an anti-ragging ordinance criminalising ragging. Later this ordinance was formalised as the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Ragging Act, 1997. Thus Tamil Nadu became the first state in India to ban ragging in educational institutions and criminalise the act. John David was convicted of Navarasu's murder and was given a double life sentence (to be served consecutively) by the Cuddalore district sessions court on 11 March 1998. The Madras High Court overturned the verdict on 5 October 2001 and acquitted him. The state of Tamil Nadu appealed to the Indian Supreme court. On 20 April 2011, the supreme court overturned the high court acquittal and confirmed the lower court's conviction. It also ordered the double life sentences to be served concurrently. John David, who had been released in 2001, turned himself in again a few days later and is currently serving his sentence. Navarasu's parents have established a non-profit anti-ragging organisation in his memory.

It documents and evaluates disorders of the equilibrium function measured by investigation procedures such as the Unterberger test, the LOLAVHESLIT test, the NEFERT test, the Romberg's test and the WOFEC test.  Method  During investigation, the patient carries a worker's helmet with two lamps fixed on it on his head; two additional lamps are fixed on the patient's shoulders. An instant camera located above the patient records the patient's movements during investigation. A computer records the results and prints them into a polar coordinate system.  History  After the Unterberger test, Romberg's test, and the WOFEC test were introduced, the deviations in the patient's movements were, at first, marked with chalk on the floor of the investigation room. In 1927, Russian medician Talpis proposed a method to record the deviations using a camera and a light source. In 1960, A. Guettich introduced the light markers on a worker's helmet; evaluation of the light trace recordings, however, was aggravated by the photographic processing taking too much time. Introduction of cranio-corpo-graphy in 1968 made it possible to evaluate the recordings directly after the investigation by using an instant camera. In 1993, the method was further developed to US-CCG (‚ÄûUltra-Sound Cranio-Corpo-Graphy‚Äú) by replacing the light markers through ultrasound markers.

History Litigation among those within a company has historically been very restricted in UK law. The attitude of courts favoured non-interference. As Lord Eldon said in the old case of Carlen v Drury,(1812) 1 Ves & B 154, 158 \\"This Court is not required on every Occasion to take the Management of every Playhouse and Brewhouse in the Kingdom.\\" If there were disagreements between the directors and shareholders about whether to pursue a claim, this was thought to be a question best left for the rules of internal management in a company's constitution, since litigation could legitimately be seen as costly or distracting from doing the company's real business. The rule in Foss v Harbottle The board of directors invariably holds the right to sue in the company's name as a general power of management.e.g. Model Articles, art 3 So if wrongs were alleged to have been done to the company, the principle from the case of Foss v Harbottle,(1843) 67 ER 189 was that the company itself was the proper claimant, and it followed that as a general rule that only the board could bring claims in court. A majority of shareholders would also have the default right to start litigation,cf Alexander Ward v Samyang [1975] 2 All ER 424 and Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London & Suffolk Properties Ltd [1989] BCLC 100 but the interest a minority shareholder had was seen as relative to the wishes of the majority. Aggrieved minorities could not, in general, sue. Only if the alleged wrongdoers were themselves in control, as directors or majority shareholder, would the courts allow an exception for a minority shareholder to derive the right from the company to launch a claim. In practice very few derivative claims were successfully brought, given the complexity and narrowness in the exceptions to the rule in Foss v Harbottle. This was witnessed by the fact that successful cases on directors' duties before the Companies Act 2006 seldom involved minority shareholders, rather than a new board, or a liquidator in the shoes of an insolvent company, suing former directors. Derivative claim Derivative claims are used by shareholders against directors alleged to have breached their duties of care or loyalty, exemplified in current litigation against BP plc executives for losses connected to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill catastrophe. The new requirements to bring a \\"derivative claim\\" are now codified in the Companies Act 2006 sections 261-264.For highly instructive comparison in the US, see Joy v North, 692 F 2d 880 (1981). Another model for a derivative claim in the German Aktiengesetz ¬ß 148, whereby 1% of shareholders, or those holding at least ‚Ç¨100,000 in shares, can bring a claim. Section 260 stipulates that such actions are concerned with suing directors for breach of a duty owed to the company. Under section 261 a shareholder must, first, show the court there is a good prima facie case to be made. This preliminary legal question is followed by the substantive questions in section 263. The court must refuse permission for the claim if the alleged breach has already been validly authorised or ratified by disinterested shareholders,See CA 2006 s 239, stipulating that a breach of duty can only be ratified by disinterested shareholders. It also appears that disinterested shareholders would not, however, be competent to ratify fraudulent behaviour, contrary to public policy. or if it appears that allowing litigation would undermine the company's success by the criteria laid out in section 172. If none of these \\"negative\\" criteria are fulfilled, the court then weighs up seven \\"positive\\" criteria. Again it asks whether, under the guidelines in section 172, allowing the action to continue would promote the company's success. It also asks whether the claimant is acting in good faith, whether the claimant could start an action in her own name,CA 2006 s 263(3) whether authorisation or ratification has happened or is likely to, and pays particular regard to the views of the independent and disinterested shareholders.CA 2006 s 263(4), and see Smith v Croft (No 2) [1988] Ch 114 This represented a shift from, and a replacement of,The pre-2006 case law may still be indicative of the present law, however since according to CA 2006 s 260(2) a claim can only be brought \\"under this Chapter\\", the sole rules for derivative actions are contained in ss 260-264. the complex pre-2006 position, by giving courts more discretion to allow meritorious claims. Still, the first cases showed the courts remaining conservative.e.g. Mission Capital plc v Sinclair [2008] EWHC 1339 (Ch) and Franbar Holdings Ltd v Patel [2008] EWHC 1534 (Ch) In other respects the law remains the same. According to Wallersteiner v Moir (No 2),[1975] QB 373 minority shareholders will be indemnified for the costs of a derivative claim by the company, even if it ultimately fails. *Stainer v Lee [2010] EWHC 1539 (Ch); [2011] B.C.C. 134; [2011] 1 B.C.L.C. 537 *Wishart, Petitioner [2009] CSIH 65; [2010] B.C.C. 161 *Kleanthous v Paphitis [2011] EWHC 2287 (Ch) Personal claims and reflective loss While derivative claims mean suing in the company's name, a minority shareholder can sue in her own name in four ways. The first is to claim a \\"personal right\\" under the constitution or the general law is breached.e.g. Pender v Lushington (1877) 6 Ch D 70, cf Macdougall v Gardiner (1875) 1 Ch D 13 If a shareholder brings a personal action to vindicate a personal right (such as the right to not be misled by company circularsSee Prudential Assurance v Newman Industries Ltd [1982] Ch 204. The duty to not mislead arises from the law of tort, and negligent misstatement.) the principle against double recovery dictates that one cannot sue for damages if the loss an individual shareholder suffers is merely the same as will be reflected in the reduction of the share value. For losses reflective of the company's, only a derivative claim may be brought.See further, Johnson v Gore Wood & Co [2002] 2 AC 1, Giles v Rhind [2002] EWCA Civ 1428, Gardner v Parker [2004] 2 BCLC 554 Amending articles A company's articles may be demonstrated to have been amended in an objectively unjustifiably and directly discriminatory fashion. This residual protection for minorities was developed by the Court of Appeal in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd,[1900] 1 Ch 656 where Sir Nathaniel Lindley MR held that shareholders may amend a constitution by the required majority so long as it is \\"bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole.\\" This constraint is not heavy, as it can mean that a constitutional amendment, while applying in a formally equal way to all shareholders, has a negative and disparate impact on only one shareholder. This was so in Greenhalgh v Arderne Cinemas Ltd,[1951] Ch 286 where the articles were changed to remove all shareholders' pre-emption rights, but only one shareholder (the claimant, Mr Greenhalgh, who lost) was interested in preventing share sales to outside parties.See also, Brown v British Abrasive Wheel Co [1919] 1 Ch 290, Sidebottom v Kershaw, Leese & Co Ltd [1920] 1 Ch 154, Dafen Tinplate Co Ltd v Llanelly Steel Co (1907) Ltd [1920] 2 Ch 124, Shuttleworth v Cox Bros and Co (Maidenhead) [1927] 1 Ch 154, Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw [1940] AC 701 and Citco Banking Corporation NV v Pusser's Ltd [2007] UKPC 13 Just and equitable winding up A drastic right of a shareholder, now under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 122(1)(g), to show it is \\"just and equitable\\" for a company to be liquidated. In Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd,[1973] AC 360 Lord Wilberforce held that a court would use its discretion to wind up a company if three criteria were fulfilled: that the company was a small \\"quasi-partnership\\" founded on mutual confidence of the corporators, that shareholders participate in the business, and there are restrictions in the constitution on free transfer of shares. Given these features, it may be just and equitable to wind up a company if the court sees an agreement just short of a contract, or some other \\"equitable consideration\\", that one party has not fulfilled. So where Mr Ebrahmi, a minority shareholder, had been removed from the board, and the other two directors paid all company profits out as director salaries, rather than dividends to exclude him, the House of Lords regarded it as equitable to liquidate the company and distribute his share of the sale proceeds to Mr Ebrahimi. Unfair prejudice The most numerous type of case in company litigation involves unfair prejudice petitions in closely held businesses. The drastic remedy of liquidation was mitigated significantly as the unfair prejudice action was introduced by the Companies Act 1985. Now under the Companies Act 2006 section 996, a court can grant any remedy, but will often simply require that a minority shareholder's interest is bought out by the majority at a fair value. The cause of action, stated in section 994, is very broad. A shareholder must simply allege they have been prejudiced (i.e. their interests as a member have been harmed) in a way that is unfair. \\"Unfairness\\" is now given a minimum meaning identical to that in Ebrahimi v Westbourne Galleries Ltd. A court must at least have an \\"equitable consideration\\" to grant a remedy. Generally this will refer to an agreement between two or more corporators in a small business that is just short of being an enforceable contract, for the lack of legal consideration. A clear assurance, on which a corporator relies, which would be inequitable to go back on, would suffice, unlike the facts of the leading case, O'Neill v Phillips.[1999] 1 WLR 1092 Here Mr O'Neill had been a prodigy in Mr Phillips' asbestos stripping business, and took on a greater and greater role until economic difficulties struck. Mr O'Neill was then demoted, but claimed that he should be given 50 per cent of the company's shares because negotiations had started for this to happen and Mr Phillips had said one day it might. Lord Hoffmann held that the vague aspiration that it \\"might\\" was not enough here: there was no concrete assurance or promise given, and so no unfairness in Mr Phillips' recanting. Unfair prejudice in this sense is an action not well suited to public companies,See Re Blue Arrow plc [1987] BCLC 585 when the alleged obligations binding the company were potentially undisclosed to public investors in the constitution, since this would undermine the principle of transparency.

MPEG-D Part 3) and also as an MPEG-4 Audio Object Type in ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009/Amd 3 in 2012. It uses time-domain linear prediction and residual coding tools (ACELP-like techniques) for speech signal segments and transform coding tools (MDCT-based techniques) for music signal segments and it is able to switch between the tool sets dynamically in a signal-responsive manner. It is being developed with the aim of a single, unified coder with performance that equals or surpasses that of dedicated speech coders and dedicated music coders over a broad range of bitrates. Enhanced variations of the MPEG-4 Spectral Band Replication (SBR) and MPEG-D MPEG Surround parametric coding tools are integrated into the USAC codec.  xHE-AAC  The MPEG-D USAC standard (ISO/IEC 23003-3) defines the xHE-AAC profile (Extended High Efficiency AAC), which contains all of the tools of the HE-AAC v2 profile plus the mono/stereo capabilities of the Baseline USAC profile. As a result, a decoder built according to the xHE-AAC profile is able to also decode the bit streams created for the previous members of the AAC family profile(s). The xHE-AAC profile was designed for applications relying on a consistent performance at low data rates while being able to decode all existing AAC-LC, HE-AAC and HE-AACv2 content. xHE-AAC extends the operating range of the codec from 12 to 300 kb/s for stereo signals and allows seamless switching between bitrates over this range for adaptive bitrate delivery (using standards such as MPEG-DASH or HLS for example). xHE-AAC also includes MPEG-D DRC mandatory loudness control to playback content at a consistent volume and offers new dynamic range control profiles for listening in noisy situations. xHE-AAC is a mandatory audio codec in the Digital Radio Mondiale standard. In April 2016, Via Licensing announced the launch of a xHE-AAC patent pool licensing program for 2016. In 2018, xHE-AAC was included in Via Licensing's AAC patent pool at no additional cost. xHE-AAC is supported in Android since Android P and in iOS since iOS 13.

It was one of the worst accidents in the recent history of the state railway company Ferrovie dello Stato. In the accident, a cargo and a passenger train collided in dense fog after the passenger train's driver passed two red signals, possibly as a result of an unwarranted assumption by the driver that the line was clear, despite the warning signals. Accident FS E652 similar to the one pulling the cargo train involved in the accident Cargo train n.59308, engine FS Class E652.100, left Rome in the morning of 7 January, headed to San Zeno-Folzano with a full load of girders. At the time of the accident, it was traveling at a speed estimated below 30 km/h on a single-rail stretch in the Verona-Bologna line near the abandoned station of Bolognina di Ronchi di Crevalcore. The area was covered by a dense fog, a common condition especially in winter in the Po valley. Visibility was estimated at 50 metres or less. At 12:53 Intercity 2225, a commuter passenger train, having left Verona at 11:39 and heading to Bologna, collided head-on at high speed with the slow moving cargo train, breaking up on impact. The passenger cars were lifted by inertia and piled up on top of each other. Some of them suffered extensive damage even though they were all MDVE class, a very widespread Italian steel-framed design which has proven itself safe since the early 1980s. The passenger train engine left the rails, leaving the first car fully exposed to the cargo train locomotive. The second car came to rest in an almost vertical condition. First rescue Two hundred rescuers were dispatched to the disaster. The fog, low visibility, and muddy soil impaired rescue efforts. Throughout the rescue operation, ambulances had to be towed by tractors provided by local farmers. Early assessments led to estimate 13 deaths ‚Äì including the four drivers of the trains ‚Äì and over 60 injured. Five passengers had to be hospitalized in critical conditions. A toll-free number for relatives to receive information on victims and wounded was established. Fifty people escaped the crash unscathed and were brought to Crevalcore by a bus provided by the comune. They later reached their destination by another train. Local supermarkets set up a canteen service for the hundreds of rescuers and provided first necessities for survivors. In the end, 17 were killed and more than 65 injured. Among the victims were all four train conductors (Vincenzo De Biase and Paolo Cinti from the Intercity, Equizio Abate and Ciro Cuccinello from the cargo). The cargo engine had to be demolished in place, along with some of the cars. Psychological issues The eeriness of the disaster scene, along with the severity of the accident, led to psychological distress among both the survivors and the responders. Psychologists were sent to the crash site in order to cope with shocked passengers and firemen. The response to the Crevalcore accident was later used as a case study by Bologna University of Psychology. Survivors' reactions were mixed: some of them displayed disbelief about the happening, while many were shocked into silence. Some exhibited irrational behaviors, such as crying for a miracle, or thanking the Virgin Mary while running in circles. Feeling of powerlessness on the part of survivors who tried to help the injured was a major cause of post-traumatic disorders. Some survivors experienced \\"survivor's guilt\\", believing that they could have given more help. Fog framed a horrific panorama for the firemen and medical personnel reaching the scene. The ghostly wreck ‚Äì much bigger than expected ‚Äì emerged from the fog \\"like a movie scene\\" (as stated by a rescuer questioned by University psychologists), just four to five meters away from the torn carriages. Rescuers who concentrated intently on their tasks were found to have coped better with the psychological pressure. Some firemen kept working well beyond usual limits, trying to overcome their feelings with excessive work. Less experienced or less well trained rescuers experienced confusion and trauma when confronted with the unexpected enormity of the tragedy; this led to logistic problems, slowing the response. Hallucinations were documented among some responders (for example, a severed human head was seen above the piled up coaches), inducing some cases of mass hysteria. Cries from the injured people were deemed a main cause of psychological breakdowns among the rescuers. After the Crevalcore accident, new procedures of stress management and psychological counseling were developed to help responders better cope with the consequences arising from this sort of incident, moving from self-managed stress control (such as, for example, relying on the need to keep a \\"tough guy\\" stance in front of fellow responders) to a group-based approach (one such approach involves conducting \\"ceremonies\\" to help those involved rationalize the shocking experiences).Psicologia contemporanea, 206, marzo aprile 2008 37; Psicologia contemporanea, 206, marzo aprile 2008 Almost all the responders, relatives and survivors who experienced mental problems ultimately managed to overcome them with help from counselors. Related suicide Train driver Alberto Guerro, a close friend of the cargo train's drivers, hanged himself five days after the disaster. He had already been suffering from post-traumatic depression after being involved in the Lavino di Mezzo (Bologna) derailment more than eight months before, and his friends' tragic endings are thought to have been a factor in his suicide. He is sometime dubbed Crevalcore's 18th victim. Inquiry Five years after the disaster, the inquiry established that Vincenzo De Biase, engineer of the passenger train, missed two red signals entering a rail block occupied by the cargo train. In the time when the accident happened, station controllers were not required to alert train drivers by phone in case of unusual crossings and charter trains, although it was a common practice anyway. The conditions for this accident unfortunately occurred soon after a shift change, so the customary phone call was forgotten. De Biase was a very experienced train driver, who had been working for many years on the line. Most likely, according to the inquiry, he ignored the red signals since he had not received an advisory phone call. While fog may have been a factor, it was downplayed in the final inquiry response. Early hypotheses of his being under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or being talking on his cellphone, were dismissed after checks. The official inquiry, led by Bologna's public prosecutor Andrea Scarpa, charged 10 people, including Trenitalia CEO Mauro Moretti and the Head of the infrastructure division of RFI Michele Mario Elia, of causing a rail disaster, involuntary homicide and involuntary wounding. They were all discharged on 11 May 2009. Ultimately, the predominant blame was placed on De Biase, with minor remarks about the line's lack of extra safety measures. The inquiry result was disputed by train engineers associations and unions, who displayed 17 cardboard coffins in front of the courthouse. Aftermath The crash location was one of many single-rail stretches of country's secondary railways. As many others, it was not equipped with automatic speed control and had only basic block control signaling. The nearest station, Bolognina di Crevalcore, was unmanned and the switch controls were remote controlled. The Bologna-Verona railway, linking two major cities, is 114 kilometers long, but some two-thirds of it (72 kilometers) were single rail. An upgrade to a two- rail line has been completed in 2009, along with installation of SCMT (a device self-limiting train speed if needed) and SSC centralized control systems. Any of these upgrades could have avoided the disaster. Trenitalia blamed the lack of upgrade on unexpected funding cuts and missed payments by Silvio Berlusconi's government.La Repubblica, 5 January 2007 A new special fund had been assigned on 20 December 2004, just 17 days before, to be paid off in the following years. After the disaster, a security system installation was planned. Just 10 months later the new SCMT automatic control was installed, and cargo trains routes were changed in order to lighten the load on single rail stretches in favor of better equipped main lines. Line upgrade was deemed a priority and works were quickly initiated. Railwaymen unions' requests for reduced speed limits in dense fog, new rules for train crossing and calls for a full scale deployment of automated traffic control systems on the whole Italian network went unheeded. A 24-hour strike was held on 16‚Äì17 January 2005, in protest against the cuts to safety budget and the practice of blaming drivers and engineers in accidents where better equipment could have been a lifesaver. In the two years before the Crevalcore accident, five accidents including the Rometta Marea derailment caused injuries that could have been avoided by better funding of safety measures. A city park located near the Bolognina station was dedicated to the victims, named Parco 7 gennaio 2005.

Plot Boston Police Department officers Detective Sergeant Nick Walker and Detective Lieutenant Bobby Hayes discover and steal several shards of gold while on duty. Nick buries his share under an orange tree sapling in his garden; his wife, Julia, thinks that the tree is a surprise gift and mentions how content she is with their life together. Nick realizes that they do not need the gold, and decides to submit it as evidence. During a raid later on, Hayes tells Nick that he can't let him turn in the gold, and kills Nick, triggering a shootout to cover up the murder. Time stops around Nick and he is drawn into a vortex in the sky, but is suddenly pulled into a room just before he reaches the top of the vortex. In the afterlife, Nick finds that he faces eternal damnation for his thievery. As penance, Nick is recruited for the R.I.P.D. (The Rest In Peace Department), who are responsible for finding and returning souls who refuse to move on to the afterlife. Left unchecked, these souls become \\"deados\\", monsters disguised as humans, and when their souls begin to rot, the environment rots around them. He is partnered with Roycephus \\"Roy\\" Pulsipher, a former U.S. Marshal and Union soldier in the American Civil War. Their first stop is at a cemetery to watch Nick's funeral, and Nick attempts to make his presence known to Julia but is not recognized. Roy explains that R.I.P.D. officers are given new identities and appearances to prevent them from revealing that the afterlife exists; Nick appears as an old Chinese man while Roy appears as a beautiful blonde woman. On his first field mission, Nick aids Roy in interrogating a suspected deado and discovers the perpetrator is in possession of gold like he and Hayes had stolen. Nick and Roy submit the gold as evidence before visiting one of Roy's informants. Nick tricks the informant into revealing Hayes as his contact. They follow Hayes to Nick's old house, where he \\"discovers\\" Nick's stolen gold. Roy and Nick track Hayes and observe him handing the gold off to a deado whom they stop and interrogate. The deado overpowers them, taking the gold and transforming into a hulking monster that leads them on a chase through the city that attracts the attention of normal humans and causes a panic. When the two return to R.I.P.D. headquarters, Chief Mildred Proctor is informed by \\"Eternal Affairs\\" that the gold fragments they found are part of an ancient weapon called the Staff of Jericho, which has the power to reverse the flow of souls from Earth to the afterlife. She also receives orders to remove Roy and Nick from the case and to suspend them from active duty due to the exposure caused by the monster's rampage. Roy and Nick argue, and Nick leaves by himself to try again to reveal himself to Julia, but she is unable to recognize him due to his altered identity and she flees. Roy tails him and they argue, but finally make amends as wells as forgiving Nick and decide to work together to stop whatever Hayes is planning. They discover that Hayes is a deado and arrest him, but a confiscated item of his freezes the whole department. Hayes and a group of deados escape with the remainder of the gold and assemble the Staff of Jericho, intending to use it to remain in the living world indefinitely. Hayes takes Julia hostage and stabs her as a necessary human sacrifice to activate the staff. A battle ensues; Pulsipher destroys the Staff of Jericho, and Nick exacts his revenge on Hayes. Being critically wounded by the sacrifice puts Julia close enough to death to see Nick for who he is; they reconcile and share a tearful farewell, with Nick encouraging Julia to continue living for both of them. Later, Proctor informs Nick that Julia will live. She reinstates them both fully, though she adds 53 years to Roy's term in the R.I.P.D. due to her revealed affections for him. As a reward, Roy also gives Nick a new appearance, but he is dismayed to find it is that of a Girl Scout.

He was an editor in Arbeiderbladet from 1952 to 1964 and 1968 to 1970, director of the International Press Institute from 1964 to 1968 and editor-in-chief of the Norwegian News Agency from 1970 to 1980. Personal life He was born in Hamar as a son of politician Fredrik Monsen (1878‚Äì1954) and teacher Aasta Inger√∏ Hansen (1884‚Äì1962). He was a brother of Randi Monsen, and through another sister he was a brother-in-law of Halvard Lange. He was also an uncle of Even Lange. Himself, he was first married to Olav Scheflo's daughter Beret Scheflo (1917‚Äì1981) from 1941 to 1950. He was then married to Poppi Tichauer Krogvig from 1952. Career He finished his secondary education in 1932, and then began a journalist career. He started out in the newspaper S√∏rlandet under editor-in-chief Olav Scheflo, his future father-in-law. Monsen was a correspondent in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. Monsen then worked in Bergens Arbeiderblad from 1937 to 1939, and in the labour movement's main newspaper Arbeiderbladet from 1939 to 1941. In 1940 the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany had begun, and Monsen was a member of the Norwegian resistance movement. He was imprisoned in M√∏llergata 19 from 1 December 1940 to 19 May 1941. After his release he fled to Sweden, where he worked in the information service for Norwegian authorities-in-exile. From 1943 to 1945 he worked out of London, where the government-in-exile was seated. He returned to Arbeiderbladet in 1945. He served as acting press attach√© for Norway in Berlin from 1948 to 1949, but returned to Arbeiderbladet again. In 1952 he was promoted to editor. He remained here until 1970, except for a period from 1964 to 1968 when he was the director of the International Press Institute in Zurich. From 1970 to 1980 he was the editor-in-chief of the Norwegian News Agency. He also chaired the Norwegian Press Association from 1954 to 1958. In the Labour Party, to which the newspaper Arbeiderbladet belonged, Monsen was known as a \\"hardliner\\" in foreign and security policy. His brother-in-law Halvard Lange served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1945 to 1965, and was a proponent for a pro-American policy in the Cold War. Monsen also supported anti-communists like Haakon Lie. In 1963 the Labour Party was about to elect a new editor-in-chief of Arbeiderbladet. The editor who was about to step down, Olav Larssen, wanted Monsen. Larssen had also worked with Per Monsen's father in Demokraten from 1913 to 1916. On the other hand, Einar Gerhardsen was against the election of Monsen as editor-in-chief of Arbeiderbladet in 1963, and Monsen was not elected.

Founded in 1914, and first published on Women's Day, it is the first socialist women's journal, and the most politically left of the women's periodicals. While the journal's beginnings are attributed to Lenin and several women who were close to him, he did not contribute to the first seven issues. It was re-organized in May 1917 as a Bolshevik journal administered by the Zhenotdel, the Women's Section of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, becoming their central publication. Later that year, its editors organized the First Conference of Working Women of the Petrograd Region (chaired by Klavdiya Nikolayeva, one of the journal's editors), promoting the Bolshevik cause in the elections to the Constituent Assembly. From the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Rabotnitsa served as the official women's publication under the Communist Party in Russia. History The journal Rabotnitsa was established in 1914 in St. Petersburg. Nadezhda Krupskaya, Lenin's wife, helped in commissioning the publication. However, Konkordiia (n√©e Gromova) Samoilova, Inessa Armand, a close friend of Lenin, were instrumental in actualizing the magazine. Anna Yelizarova-Ulyanova, one of Lenin's sisters, found a press willing to print two issues per month. The first editor was a male, Felix Vasilievich Martsinkevich, while the publisher was a female, D.F. Petrovskaia, the wife of a Bolshevik Duma deputy. Its editorial board was composed of Armand and Samoilova, as well as A. I. Yelizarova-Ulyanova, N. K. Krupskaya, P. F. Kudelli, L. R. Menzhinskaya, Y. F. Rozmirovich, and L. N. Stal. It prospered at the encouragement and support provided by Lenin. It was published by Izdatel'stvo \\"Pressa\\" in the Russian language. The money needed to support the publication was collected from women workers. The mimosa (technically, the Silver Wattle) is the symbol of the celebrations of Women's day in Russia and Italy. The first issue was published on International Women's Day, 23 February 1914, with 12,000 copies. It lacked a cover, illustrations and an issuing body. It was a quarterly journal for the period 24 February (8 March) to June 1914. In its first year, its circulation was 12,000. Initially, there were seven issues of which three were confiscated by the police as there was strict censorship by the Communist Party. The magazine ceased its publication after the seven issues due to the difficulties associated with World War I. The journal restarted on 10 May (23), 1917, its cover announcing that it was now a part of the central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party. Following the October 1917 Revolution, the magazine created a citywide awareness of the revolution. This was followed by the \\"First All-Russian Congress of Women Workers\\" in 1918 after which the tsarist government closed the magazine, and all members of the editorial board were jailed. Its publication was resumed in Moscow in January 1923. Ulyanova worked for the magazine at that time, but did not follow the instructions of her brother, Lenin, who by now was abroad, and she resisted efforts by Armand to make the magazine more theoretical. In 1926, the magazine published articles about a perceived male resistance to women entering metal and machine-tool work jobs, which were typically dominated by men. Within 10 years the magazine congratulated its readership, stating that women \\"form more than one quarter of all metal workers and machine construction workers, and almost a quarter of all workers in the coal industry...\\" In 1933, Joseph Stalin complemented the magazine with a personal greeting. A 1935 issue was on the topic of motherhood; in 1936, that was an article on narcotics easing labour pain; and in 1946, there was an article on new fabrics. For Rabotnitsa, the period between 1914 and 1944 has been described as \\"the most dramatic and challenging years of its existence\\", when strong ties were maintained between the press and the political leadership of the country. Rabotnisa was relaunched in 1996. Advocacy Rabotnitsa is one of the oldest Russian language magazines exclusively devoted to women and families. The magazine's basic theme is to advocate proletarian internationalism and international labor solidarity as a means to checkmate imperialism. Its advocacy is for \\"social justice, the emancipation of women, and worldwide peace.\\" The magazine meant to make women workers aware of the political situation in the country and acted as a catalyst in participation of women in the socialist revolution in Russia. The magazine's editors wrote about transforming domestic life through raising the consciousness of men, and blamed social problems on the lingering influence of patriarchy. The magazine paved the way for the women workers to \\"participate in state and public life and in the building of communism\\". It was instrumental in awakening the women workers to the political reality of the times and brought them under the party's banner. It also helped in propagating Leninist ideology of the socialist revolution. Similar publications Like Krest'yanka (\\"the peasant woman\\"), Rabotnitsa's audience was the ordinary woman and not the activist; and these were the only publications that were available both throughout the country as well as throughout the Stalin era for that audience. Rabotnitsa functioned as a women's supplement to Pravda (\\"truth\\"). Circulation The magazine cost four kopeks in 1914, and the circulation that year was 12,000; in 1918, it was between 30,000 and 40,000. By 1930, it was published in bimonthly press runs of 265,000 copies. In 1974, circulation was 12.6 million; and in 1986, it was 13.3 million. In the 1990s, its circulation was reported to be a record high. It began as a bi-weekly pamphlet, evolved into an illustrated weekly, and later became a monthly journal. Awards and criticism Rabotnitsa has received many awards, such as the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1933) and the Order of Lenin (1964). Criticism from the Bolshevik women readership centered on the magazine being out of touch with its audience. However, this may have been aimed at Armand. Editors preferred stories of interest to women workers, as well as their poetry and fiction, while Armand preferred theoretical and propaganda pieces written by √©migr√© women such as herself. In spite of a poor review of its quality, Soviet women found the magazine to be \\"a friend, an adviser, a consultant, and an entertainer\\".

As implied, three individual images, or messages, can be displayed on a Trivision.http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1056921/JCDecaux-switches-off- rotating-billboards/ The Trivision is most commonly used as a commercial sign and is used both indoors and outdoors. Trivision billboards are commonly found along highways and in city centers. The changing messages on the rotating prisms are intended to catch the attention of its viewer. Many individual studies that have been made in different countries, shows that the movement within a Trivision attracts attention and increases brand impact. The basic principle was used to change scenes in ancient Greek theatre with wooden prism devices known as Periaktos. The first U.S. patent using this principle in a motorized display was issued in 1901. In 1950 many suppliers existed in USA. Today the product exists all over the world and can be built in all size and shapes such as curved, giant sizes, city format, on walls, in landscape format, portrait format, and over bridges. The sign can be used on-demand, meaning the correct message will appear when the command is given to the sign. Commonly these signs are used in traffic and often called ‚ÄúVariable Message Sign‚Äù (VMS). A VMS can be used for directional, speed limit, warning, parking guidance and toll booths. The VMS can also be used in advertising for applications, such as morning- and/or evening-messages. Other names of this sign include: Tri-Face, Three Message Sign, Prismavision, Prismatic displays.

The tradition of annual blacksmith gatherings at Helf≈°t√Ωn started in 1982. Initially, the event involved only blacksmiths from the former Czechoslovakia. Thanks to the efforts of the master blacksmith Alfred Habermann, who spread the information about the event not only in the Czechoslovakia but also abroad, the gatherings gradually turned into a meeting place for blacksmiths from all over the world. The Hefaiston is visited by artist blacksmiths from the Central and Western Europe, but also from Japan, Argentina, Canada, Israel, Uzbekistan etc.  Structure and organization  The main principle of the Hefaiston remains unchanged for years. It starts one week before the main competition with the workshop called The Blacksmith Forum. During the forum, one or groups of blacksmiths working in the castle realize their ideas and designs. Their iron works are subsequently displayed at the castle, and during the weekend are confronted with the works of their blacksmith competitors. Each gathering is connected with the competition. The expert jury evaluates the works of blacksmiths in two categories, works imported to Helf≈°t√Ωn and works created directly at the castle. The jury evaluates the exhibits in the following categories: * Classical artistic blacksmithing * Sculptural works and chamber sculpture * Jewelry * Weapons * Damascene metal work * Iron founding work Since 2008, the best blacksmiths receive the Alfred Habermann Award. A part of the exhibited works remains in the possession of the castle, and Helf≈°t√Ωn represent one of the world's greatest collections of artistic metalworks.

Career He finished his secondary education in 1961, entered the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration and graduated with an MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1966. He worked as a finance analyst for Capital Research Company in the US and Switzerland, and ventured into investments. In 1972 he was involved in the family company Th. Br√∏vig, mainly with capital investment. He also became a board member of several companies where he had invested. Investments in companies such as Tandberg, Hafslund Nycomed and particularly Norsk Data (which became defunct in 1992) \\"rescued [...] the family shipping company through a substantial crisis in the 1980s\\". Br√∏vig was a board member of Norsk Data throughout the company's existence. Hafslund Nycomed was started when Hafslund bought Nycomed in the 1980s, and Br√∏vig was behind this as a board member of Hafslund. In 1992, the family shipping company was again saved, this time with the selling of Hafslund Nycomed shares. In Tandberg, Br√∏vig was chairman from 1985 to 1997, then in Tandberg Television. Br√∏vig was also a board member of World Wildlife Fund in Norway from 1988 to 1996 (chair since 1994) and the Norwegian Shipowners' Association from 1990 to 1998 (vice president since 1996). Br√∏vig moved from Switzerland to Norway in 1983. In January 1986 he married Inger Sande.

Tryptophol is an aromatic alcohol that induces sleep in humans. It is found in wine as a secondary product of ethanol fermentation. It was first described by Felix Ehrlich in 1912. It is also produced by the trypanosomal parasite in sleeping sickness. It forms in the liver as a side-effect of disulfiram treatment. Natural occurrences Tryptophol can be found in Pinus sylvestris needles or seeds. It is produced by the trypanosomal parasite (Trypanosoma brucei) in sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis). Tryptophol is found in wine and beer as a secondary product of ethanol fermentation (Article in French) (a product also known as congener) by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is also an autoantibiotic produced by the fungus Candida albicans. It can also be isolated from the marine sponge Ircinia spiculosa. Metabolism Biosynthesis It was first described by Felix Ehrlich in 1912. Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast attacks the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with hydroxyl. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. Tryptophan is first deaminated to 3-indolepyruvate. It is then decarboxylated to indole acetaldehyde by indolepyruvate decarboxylase. This latter compound is transformed to tryptophol by alcohol dehydrogenase.Pathway: tryptophan degradation VIII (to tryptophol) at BioCyc.org It is formed from tryptophan, along with indole-3-acetic acid in rats infected by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. An efficient conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetic acid and/or tryptophol can be achieved by some species of fungi in the genus Rhizoctonia. Biodegradation In Cucumis sativus (cucumber), the enzymes indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADH) and indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADPH) use tryptophol to form (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde. Glycosides The unicellular alga Euglena gracilis converts exogenous tryptophol to two major metabolites: tryptophol galactoside and an unknown compound (a tryptophol ester), and to minor amounts of indole-3-acetic acid, tryptophol acetate, and tryptophol glucoside. Biological effects Tryptophol and its derivatives 5-hydroxytryptophol and 5-methoxytryptophol, induce sleep in mice. It induces a sleep-like state that lasts less than an hour at the 250 mg/kg dose. These compounds may play a role in physiological sleep mechanisms. It may be a functional analog of serotonin or melatonin, compounds involved in sleep regulation. Tryptophol shows genotoxicity in vitro. Tryptophol is a quorum sensing molecule for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is also found in the bloodstream of patients with chronic trypanosomiasis. For that reason, it may be a quorum sensing molecule for the trypanosome parasite. In the case of trypanosome infection, tryptophol decreases the immune response of the host. As it is formed in the liver after ethanol ingestion or disulfiram treatment, it is also associated with the study of alcoholism. Pyrazole and ethanol have been shown to inhibit the conversion of exogenous tryptophol to indole-3-acetic acid and to potentiate the sleep-inducing hypothermic effects of tryptophol in mice. It is a growth promoter of cucumber hypocotyl segments. The auxinic action in terms of embryo formation is even better for tryptophol arabinoside on Cucurbita pepo hypocotyl fragments.

Early life Partner went to school in Winchester and then at Charterhouse School in Surrey, England. He first discovered photography at Winchester School of Art, taking portraits and photo documentary images. Partner's British influences included the early Victorian masters David Hill, Robert Adamson, and Julia Margaret Cameron. He was also influenced by 20th century American photographers such as Paul Strand, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams and the surrealist Man Ray; and by the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood of painters. After art school, Partner moved to Paris, working as a photographers‚Äô assistant, primarily with fashion and advertising photographers, learning to use mixed lighting techniques, as well as the business of photography. Partner worked on many major advertising campaigns including for Citroen, De Beers and G.H. Mumm. Partner also assisted on photographing portraits of Paris mayor Jacques Chirac, Spanish artist Salvador Dal√≠ and Russian artist and designer Ert√©. Career In the 1980s, Partner moved to London where his first published photograph was in the Sunday Times Magazine, and then also in The Observer, The Sunday Telegraph, The Daily Express and The Mail on Sunday on Sunday magazines. A feature on his work in the magazine Creative Review led to commissions from business magazines and design companies, where he worked on many of the top 100 plc's annual reports, developing a distinctive style of large format industrial photography. In 2005, Partner initiated a series of 100-plus portrait photographs of all United Kingdom government ministers, with the intent of highlighting the normality of the lesser-known personalities in government. The ‚ÄúHeads of Government‚Äù series, now held in several national collections, was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in London during 2005/2006 In 2006/2007, in recognition of his expertise and interest in the institutions that have developed over generations he was honoured to receive the first ever photographic commission from the British House of Commons entitled ‚ÄòWorking for Parliament‚Äô. Following in the footsteps, he later discovered, of Victorian MP and photographer Sir John Benjamin Stone, this saw Partner photographing over 100 staff from all departments of the House of Commons at the Palace of Westminster. This was followed by an exhibition at Portcullis House, Westminster and a commemorative book.

It was federally listed as endangered species of the United States in 1996.USFWS. Determination of Endangered or Threatened Status for Fourteen Plant Taxa From the Hawaiian Islands. Federal Register October 10, 1996. This plant has a short, thick stem growing up to about 36 centimeters in maximum height. The leaves have leathery blades measuring up to 8 centimeters long. They are heart-shaped or kidney-shaped and are divided into several large lobes. The inflorescence is a cluster of flowers at the top of the stem. Each cluster has up to three bisexual flowers and up to seven male flowers with nonfunctioning female parts. The flowers have purple petals, making it easy to identify among the sanicles present in Hawaii. This plant grows in boggy habitat among other plants such as Argyroxiphium grayanum and Oreobolus furcatus. By 1996 there was only one population remaining on Oahu, and possibly another, but the latter had not been seen in years. On Maui there were three populations. The total global population of the plant was estimated to be no more than 210 individuals.

Biography  L√©on-Joseph-√âmile Coornaert was born on 31 August 1886, in Hondschoote, Nord, France. He was the thirteenth and last child of a family of farm workers. After the death of his father in 1898, he entered the Petit S√©minaire Saint- Fran√ßois d'Assise in Hazebrouck, which he left in 1903. Profoundly influenced by the education he received, he returned to the school very regularly throughout his life. After graduation, he split his time between his studies and his work. He was a member of Le Sillon, a political and religious movement started by Marc Sangier. After earning his Bachelor of Arts in Journalism in 1906, he pursued studies in history in Lille (at the Institut catholique de Lille) and then at Sorbonne where he obtained a graduate degree in medieval history. Although exempted from military service, he enlisted in 1915. He first fought in the 1st Infantry Regiment, then joined 8th Engineer Regiment until the end of the First World War. He was a Sergeant Engineer who worked in the intelligence section, a role which utilized his knowledge of German. He married Alice Robert in 1921 and traveled regularly until the end of his life to his family home in Allarmont, Vosges. The couple had three children. √âmile Coornaert died in Paris on 25 February 1980. He is buried at Allarmont. His wife Alice died in 1991 at the age of 94.  Labour historian  Released from the army in 1919, √âmile Coornaert passed the History teacher's examination (known in France as \\"l'agr√©gation d'histoire\\") and worked in Alen√ßon, Nancy, and at the Lyc√©e Condorcet in Paris. He received his PhD in 1930, and was named Director of Economic Historical Studies at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes where Marc Bloch took a liking to him. He started collaboration with Bloch and the Annales in 1932. √âmile Coornaert was named the Chair of History at the University of S√£o Paulo in Brazil (1934‚Äì1935), where he created a French Studies department. In 1936, √âmile Coornaert replaced Fran√ßois Simiand as Chair of Labour History at the Coll√®ge de France. He was chosen over Maxime Leroy and Maurice Halbwachs for the position. Halbwachs assessed that \\"Coornaert is mediocre.... he has done some scholarly work on 15th century corporations... he has a strong Belgian accent, and no other characteristics. A Christian Democrat, and currently a member of the resistance... but a good Catholic, and intent on subsidizing private schools.\\" √âmile Coornaert published two theses on the drapery-sayetterie of Hondschoote (13th to 18th century) and the wool industry in Bergues-Saint-Winnoc (14th to 17th century). In 1941, he wrote a book on French Corporations before 1789.  Membership in the Resistance  In 1941, √âmile Coornaert joined the Resistance movement created by Henri de Montfort, Director of Services at the Institut de France. The group, composed notably of diplomat Paul Petit, writer Marietta Martin, and Suzanne Feingold, published La France continue beginning in 1941. The newspaper was printed by the Parisian press of Francisque Gay, situated on Cardinal Street. The tone of the paper was considered \\"very literary and occasionally rude. It made blunt, violent attacks against P√©tain.\\" La France continue was, along with L'Universit√© libre and T√©moignage chr√©tien, one of the rare resistance journals which denounced the situation faced by the Jewish people. The members of the group followed a Christian-based ideology. After a large part of the group was arrested at the start of 1942, several of the remaining members joined the Jacques Destr√©es' Resistance movement. √âmile Coornaert cooperated with different networks doing information work. Following World War II, La France continue became Ici Paris, on 13 June 1945.  Union activist  √âmile Coornaert had worked before the war for the French Confederation of Christian Workers at the √âcoles normales ouvri√®res. After the war, √âmile Coornaert stayed close to his Christian Democratic background. He contributed to the relaunch of the Syndicat g√©n√©ral de l'√âducation nationale (the General Union of National Education), affiliating it with the CFTC with Marcel Reinhard, a teacher at Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. During a meeting on 26 October 1944 √âmile Coornaert was elected president of the union. He enforced the notion of using the union as an \\"instrument of social transformation\\" which would continue the work of the Resistance through \\"a revolution without hatred and without violence, inspired by a spiritual conception of the world.\\" He represented the union as part of the commission preparing the implementation of the Langevin-Wallon plan to reform education. After the rejection of a school policy motion which he had presented, √âmile Coornaert left his position as president of SGEN but continued his involvement in the life of the union. The position he had held was dismantled.  Academic life  In continuing his activities as a historian, √âmile Coornaert published books on France and international commerce in Antwerp, end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century (1961) and French compagnonnages, from the Middle Ages to modern times (1966). His final book, published in 1977, was on the historical profession (Destins de Clio en France depuis 1800). In 1958, he became a member of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, one of the five academies in the Institut de France. He was named a member of the Historical Commission on the French Revolution, a commission created as part of the Committee for Historical and Scientific Works (CTHS, 1969-1980).

Early years and education Marietta Martin (also called Marietta Arthur-Martin or Marietta Martin-Le Dieu) was born 4 October 1902 at Arras (Pas-de-Calais). She was the daughter of Arthur Martin, editor-in-chief of Le Courrier du Pas-de- Calais, and Henriette Martin-Le Dieu. When she was four, her father died, and she lived with her mother, a piano teacher at Arras, and her sister Lucie. During the German offensive in the north of France in August 1914, the family took refuge in Paris.https://web.archive.org/web/20160310114556/http://plaques- commemoratives.org/plaques/ile-de-france/plaque.2006-09-29.0175398730/view After attending high school at the lyc√©e Moli√®re, she enrolled in the Faculty of Medicine then switched to study for a degree in literature. She learned several languages, becoming fluent in English, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish and Danish. She was a musician, playing the piano and the violin. She travelled in several countries, and had long stays in Poland, where she lived with her sister and her brother-in-law, Adam Ros√©, a diplomat and minister. Her travels inspired her to write an essay on Marie-Th√©r√®se Geoffrin.http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32424300j/PUBLIC In 1925, under the guidance of thesis supervisor Fernand Baldensperger, she presented her thesis for the degree of doctor of comparative literature. Its subject was the life and work of David Ferdinand Koreff, a German doctor whose connections included some notable French writers.http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb30896161j/PUBLIC Writer Suffering from lung disease, Marietta Martin spent several years between 1927 and 1931 in Switzerland, in a sanatorium in Leysin in the Canton of Vaud. In 1933, her first literary work was published, Histoires du paradis (Stories of Paradise).http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb32424298t/PUBLIC In a letter written from Switzerland, she summarised her thought: \\"If a message has to be sent around the world, it shouldn't be based on suffering, that would increase suffering; it would be a false message. If it is a message for the earth, it should be a message for body and spirit. To really live, according to all the rules, the definitive teaching is: be joyous.\\" In 1936, Martin was approached by Maurice Tailliandier (1873-1951), out-going deputy of the second electorate of Pas-de-Calais (Arras), where he belonged to the Republicain et social group. He asked her to prepare documents for his political campaign. She accepted the work, in the name of support given by her father to Henri Tailliandier, Maurice's father, who had been deputy in the same electorate from 1885-1910. In 1938 Marietta Martin prepared a collection of her poems, Adieu temps (Farewell, time) that was published posthumously in 1947. Resistance worker Shortly after the beginning of the war, Marietta Martini became part of the R√©seau Hector, an important intelligence and combat group in the Zone Nord, the northern and western part of France under the German military administration in occupied France during World War II. She joined La France Continue, a resistance movement in France which between 1941 and 1942 published an underground newspaper with the same name. Her bedroom in the rue de l'Assomption in Paris (16 th arrondissement) became the editorial office of the newspaper. Others who worked in this movement included Henri and Annie de Montfort, Paul Petit, √âmile Coornaert, Suzanne Feingold and Raymond Burgard. Twelve issues of the newspaper were published between 1941 and 1942. Marietta Martin wrote articles for the newspaper, and delivered copies by bicycle in Paris. She also sent out several thousand copies by post. La France Continue was distributed by a group led by Robert Gu√©don. In February 1942, the group was shut down by Geheime Feldpolizei, the German secret military police. Paul Petit, Raymond Burgard and Marietta Martin were taken in the same raid. The military police searched Marietta Martin's room on the night of 7 to 8 February 1942 and seized a document with the title \\"Avec de Gaulle, avec l'Angleterre\\" (With de Gaulle, with England). In a judgement in 1943, it was described as a fairly long political article, written by her and reworked several times. The German authorities would have put it in a safe place, but it has never been found. Marietta Martin was accused of writing and circulating clandestine publications and of being an activist in the Lib√©ration Nationale movement of Henri Frenay and Robert Gu√©don. She was imprisoned in La Sant√© Prison in Paris, and then deported to Germany 16 March 1942, where she stayed in eight successive penitentiary establishments. Along with Paul Petit and Raymond Burgard, she was condemned to death on 16 October 1943 by the People's Court (Germany) (Volksgerichtshof) of Sarrebruck for complicity with the enemy. In prison in Cologne awaiting execution, she was cared for by fellow prisoner and Resistance worker Gilberte Bonneau du Martray. Other Resistance workers in the prison at that time included Elizabeth Dussauze, Jane Sivadon, H√©l√®ne Vautrin et Odile Kienlen. Because of bombardments, Marietta Martin was transferred, on a stretcher because of weakness, to Frankfurt. She died there on 11 November 1944. In 1949, her body was repatriated to Paris where she was buried with military honours in the Clichy cemetery. Honours and recognition On 18 April 1946 Mariette Martin was posthumously awarded the Legion of Honour and the Croix de guerre. On 26 August 1947, she was cited for the order of the army corps. She was made a sub-lieutenant of Free France (Forces fran√ßaises combattantes, France Libre).

For their motto, Henri de Montfort chose a quotation by Georges Clemenceau: \\"Dans la guerre comme dans la paix, le dernier mot est √† ceux qui ne se rendent jamais.\\" (\\"In war as in peace, the last word belongs to those who never surrender.\\").Quid.

Biography  Spiridion LusiHis surname Lusi is the Italianization of Greek surname Louzis was of Greek origin. He was born on the island of Cephalonia in 1741, at that time a possession of the Republic of Venice. He migrated to Italy where he resided for many years and was educated in the Greek College at Venice, and later at the University of Padua. He was eventually sent as Venice's minister to London, and in Prussia and Berlin. From 1763 to 1765, he translated the four volumes of a translation of Lucian from the Greek language into Italian, in four volumes published in London and Venice in 1764. Lusi added some dialogue translated by Gasparo Gozzi. Several years later he moved to Vienna. In 1775, whilst Lusi was in Breslau, he made the acquaintance of Frederick the Great. He came to Berlin in 1777, where he was introduced into society and presented to the king at Potsdam. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, he joined the volunteer corps as a Captain, fought with distinction against the Austrians and was soon promoted to Major. In 1780 he was hired as Prussian ambassador to London, a position he assumed in February 1781. With the improvement of Prussia's relations with England, which occurred in the last years of Frederick's reign, Lusi managed to exert a more fruitful ambassadorial activity. In 1784 he was appointed Colonel. He was recalled in October 1788 from London, and in 1790 he accompanied the new king, Frederick William II, who contracted an army against Austria. In January 1792 he had a son, Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig August Spiridion (Œ¶œÅŒµŒπŒ¥ŒµœÅŒØŒ∫ŒøœÇ ŒõŒøœçŒ∂Œ∑œÇ), who would eventually become captain in the Guards Regiment. In 1792 he was appointed Major General by King Frederick William III, and Lieutenant General in 1798. In 1800 he was appointed ambassador at St. Petersburg, but he was dismissed two years later at his own request. Thereafter he lived quietly and withdrawn in Potsdam, where he died in 1815. His descendants settled both in Germany and in Ireland. The name died out in Ireland in 1919 with the death of his granddaughter Countess Elise de Lusi, but his other Irish descendants include the physicist Professor John Joly FRS (1857‚Äì1933).http://divainternational.ch/spip.php?article352 In Germany still are living descendants.

Description Persoonia arborea is a large shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of , its young branchlets densely covered with greyisf to rust-coloured hairs. The leaves are narrow spatula-shaped to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide. The flowers are arranged singly in the axils of leaves on a pedicel up to long, the tepals long, hairy on the outside with a spine long on the end and white anthers. Flowering occurs from December to March and the fruit is a yellowish green, oval drupe up to about long and wide. Taxonomy Persoonia arborea was first formally described in 1865 by Ferdinand von Mueller in the fifth volume of Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae, based on material he collected from the \\"headwaters of the La Trobe and Yarra Rivers\\".

She fought with her friend Mariya Polivanova who acted as her spotter. Natalya fought bravely throughout the war; she was killed fighting German Wehrmacht forces near Novgorod in August 1942. She was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's highest award for bravery, on 14 February 1943. Early life Natalya Kovshova was born on 26 November 1920 in Ufa, modern-day capital of the Republic of Bashkortostan in Russia. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to Moscow. She was educated at a high school in Moscow. After graduating from high school, Kovshova began work at a Moscow research institute while waiting to be accepted into a university of aviation. She met a girl named Mariya Polivanova while in the institute; the two became good friends. World War II When the German-Soviet War began in 1941, Kovshova joined a Narodnoe Opolcheniye (self-defence) unit in Moscow with Polivanova at age 21. These self-defence groups were started when German Luftwaffe aircraft began to bomb Russian cities and towns. Kovshova was put in charge of the observation and communication department. She spent many nights in the control tower. After her experience at the self-defence group, Kovshova attended sniper training in the 528th Rifle Regiment as well as the Central Women's Sniper Training School. After her training had been completed, she was sent to the front with the 528th Rifle Regiment. In January 1942, Kovshova and Polivanova, who had joined the same regiment shortly after Kovshova, began fighting the German forces on the Northwestern Front. Both women established themselves as the Regiment's resident snipers. Kovshova was the shooter in the two-women sniper team, and Polivanova acted as the spotter. They both fought in the Battle of Moscow when the 528th Rifle Regiment were sent to help defend Russia's capital. During the battle, Kovshova proved to be an expert sniper, killing many German soldiers. She also dug numerous anti-tank emplacements, machine gun nests, and infantry trenches during the defence. She took the job of training new soldiers how to use the rifles. She also trained the best students to become snipers, teaching them marksmanship early; passing on her shooting skills. For her actions in the battle of Moscow, Kovshova was awarded the Order of the Red Star. 1944 Soviet postage stamp depicting Polivanova and Kovshova Kovshova expressed great hatred of the Germans during the war. She was inspired by the Soviet propaganda explaining how the Soviet soldiers were fighting for the liberation of the Motherland. She wrote to her mother in 1942: \\"You can hear horrible stories from local residents who have been in the hands of the fascist pigs. The women we live with had a guest come to visit said that the Germans shot her brother and four of her friends simply because they went outside after 4pm.\\" Natalya found great delight in killing German soldiers. She wrote to her mother on 7 July 1942: \\"My dearest Mama!\\" \\"Please don't be angry that I didn't write to you about being wounded. But I didn't want to worry you for no reason, since nothing serious happened...\\" \\"I've been back with my unit 2nd June 1942. Now Mashenka [Mariya] and I are working with the young snipers. Their statistics are looking good. In the last two weeks of June our students took down 3 Fritzes. Not bad!\\"... \\"A few days ago five of us went on reconnaissance without saying anything to the company commander. We were right under the German's very noses and they had no clue!\\" On 14 August 1942, Kovshova's regiment was committed to the fighting near the village of Sutoki-Byakovo in the Novgorod Oblast. The machine gunners and snipers resisted the German offensive in trenches. The Soviet soldiers were killed one after another, until only Kovshova and Polivanova remained, both wounded. As being captured was not an option, Kovshova decided to pull the pin of her grenade, and wait to blow the German soldiers up when they reached the trench. When the Germans finally reached the trench, Kovshova detonated the grenades, killing herself, Polivanova and many German soldiers. She was posthumously awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union shortly after, in recognition of her sacrifice. It is estimated that Kovshova and Polivanova together killed over 300 German soldiers. A Soviet fishing factory trawler was christened \\"Natalya Kovshova\\" in the 1960s.

It focused on underground and post-industrial music, including ambient, heavy metal, gothic, and industrial music. The site, which was established in 2003, was one of the longest-running webzines of its kind and has been dubbed \\"one of the leading online magazines for post-industrial music\\" and \\"the internet's foremost authority on neofolk.\\" The website temporarily closed in June 2010 but was relaunched in July 2011 at a different domain. The staff stopped publishing new content in August 2019, without explanation, and by January 2020, the domain had expired. History Heathen Harvest has given support to many underground artists and rarely features mainstream bands. It has a current review archive of over 4,800 individual reviews of underground music albums.Heathen Harvest review archive Retrieved 19 July 2011 Heathen Harvest originally began as the Heathen Harvest Music Review, written by Malahki Thorn for RFD Magazine in 2002. Thorn had moved from San Francisco to pursue a quieter life away from the city in Trinity County, California and wanted to share his high-school influences through post-industrial music with the Radical Faeries community. In December 2006 the site design was overhauled and the magazine began publishing on a bi-monthly basis.Heathen Harvest new design Retrieved 19 July 2011 Multiple journalists collectively contributed over one hundred articles per month, such as Nick Quarm, Sage L. Weatherford, Patrick O‚Äôsullivan and Elena ZG, who would make up the core of the magazine for most of this period. Soon more journalists were welcomed onboard but eventually (with the exception of Sage L. Weatherford, Patrick O‚Äôsullivan, and Elena ZG), all of this original group left or were dismissed. A handful of new writers entered Heathen Harvest, but gradually those running the webzine began to burn out due to the amount of money and time it was taking to process the immense amount of material submitted. The US record label First Fallen Star said of the webzine, \\"amid an ocean of pathetic websites offering up poorly written one-paragraph reviews merely to justify turning around and selling the albums on eBay for profit, Heathen Harvest was always, and continues to be, a site diligently maintained by a group of serious people, writing serious reviews of the music we all love\\". Heathen Harvest has been entirely self-financed and non-profit since its foundation, being driven purely by volunteer staff \\"motivated by their love of music and art\\". Closure, relaunch, and final closure In June 2010, Thorn announced that issue 84 of Heathen Harvest was to be the final issue, citing financial concerns as the reason for the closure. At the start of 2011, a collective of the old Heathen Harvest staff assembled to officially restart the webzine in a blog format on a different server. It took several months to restart the webzine and the new site was finally launched on 4 July 2011 under the name of The Heathen Harvest Periodical to distinguish it from the old site, and under the new domain heathenharvest.org. The site worked mostly with digital review media and became more selective over what it reviewed. The old site, heathenharvest.com, remained online for archival purposes until 2013. In early 2020, heathenharvest.org went offline. A user on the power electronics Special Interests forum relayed that the site had been shut down intentionally. There was no official announcement of the closure. An archive of the site's posts made between 2011 and 2016 remains online at the old Heathen Harvest blog.

He concentrates particularly on the work of Liszt; Barnes also has worked extensively with Philip Glass, whose Piano Concerto No. 2 he premiered in 2004 at the Lied Center for Performing Arts. Barnes teaches at University of Nebraska-Lincoln school of music. He also teaches summer courses at the Vienna International Piano Academy. Praised by the New York Times for his ‚ÄúLisztian thunder and deft fluidity,‚Äù and the San Francisco Chronicle as ‚Äúferociously virtuosic,‚Äù pianist Paul Barnes has electrified audiences with his intensely expressive playing and cutting-edge programming. He has been featured four times on APM‚Äôs Performance Today and on the cover of Clavier Magazine. His recent performance at Lincoln Center was featured in the New Yorker Magazine. He has performed in England, China, Korea, Austria, Russia, Greece, Italy, Serbia, Hungary, and in all major cities throughout the US. Deeply inspired by the aesthetic challenge of minimalism, Barnes commissioned and gave the world premier performance of Philip Glass‚Äôs Piano Concerto No. 2 (After Lewis and Clark). The Omaha World Herald praised Barnes playing for his ‚Äúdriving intensity and exhilaration.‚Äù Nebraska Educational Telecommunications' production \\"The Lewis and Clark Concerto,\\" a documentary/performance of the concerto featuring Barnes, won an Emmy for Best Performance Production. Additional performances included collaborations with conductor Marin Alsop at the prestigious Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music and also the Northwest Chamber Orchestra where the Seattle Times called Barnes' performance \\"an impressive feat.\\" The world- premier recording with the NWCO was released by Orange Mountain Music. Gramophone Magazine remarked that this recording is \\"certainly one of the most enjoyable recent releases of Glass's music...Paul Barnes is a shining soloist.\\" Orange Mountain Music also released Barnes' recording of his transcriptions from the operas of Philip Glass, including both the Trilogy Sonata and the Orph√©e Suite for Piano. Gramophone Magazine observed that ‚ÄúBarnes offers a surprisingly expressive reading‚Ä¶. Atmosphere and rhythmic vitality are important, and these qualities Barnes has in abundance.‚Äù The American Record said \\"Barnes is an expressive pianist with a lovely tone and a flair for the dramatic.\\" New York critic Joseph Dalton described Barnes' playing of the Glass transcriptions as \\"atmospheric and elegant,\\" while San Francisco critic Michael McDonagh hailed Barnes' performance as \\"remarkably effective, highly expressive.‚Äù The Trilogy Sonata and the Orph√©e Suite for Piano are published by Chester Music of London and are available at sheetmusicplus.com. Barnes also serves as head chanter at Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church in Lincoln where his fascination with Byzantine chant led to a commissioned piano concerto \\"Ancient Keys\\" written by Victoria Bond based on a Greek chant. The world-premier recording of this concerto as well as Gershwin‚Äôs Rhapsody in Blue was released on Albany Records. With performances throughout Europe, the Near East, the Far East, and the U.S., Barnes' unique lecture/recitals have received international acclaim. Liszt and the Cross: Music as Sacrament in the B Minor Sonata explores the fascinating relationship between music, theology, and the Orthodox icon. Barnes' live recording of this lecture recital was recently released on the Liszt Digital label. The British Society Newsletter reviewed the recording and wrote that Barnes was ‚Äúa fine pianist and gives us a performance of resounding conviction.‚Äù Clavier Magazine wrote \\"It is a majestic, reverential performance that elevates listeners to the sacred experience Barnes so eloquently describes in the lecture.\\" Barnes is the Marguerite Scribante Professor of Music and Co-Chair of Piano at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Glenn Korff School of Music. He teaches during the summer at the Vienna International Piano Academy and the famed Amalfi Coast Festival in Italy, as well as the Piano Plus Festival in Corfu, Greece. He also coaches the students of Menahem Pressler, Barnes' own teacher, at Indiana University where Barnes received his doctorate in Piano Performance. In great demand as a pedagogue and clinician, Barnes has served as convention artist at several state MTNA conventions and was recently named ‚ÄòTeacher of the Year‚Äù by the Nebraska Music Teachers Association. Recent performances include a celebration of Philip Glass's 75th year in 2012, where Barnes performed all of his Glass transcriptions at Lincoln Center and the world premier of N.

Upcoming performances include the world premiere of Barnes‚Äô solo transcription of Joan Tower‚Äôs Piano Concerto ‚ÄúHomage to Beethoven‚Äù on April 5 of 2014 at Lincoln Center‚Äôs Bruno Walter Theater. His eleventh CD The American Virtuoso featuring the music of Philip Glass, Samuel Barber, and Joan Tower was released on Orange Mountain Music to much critical acclaim.

This chemical compound can dissolve in water to form hydroastatic acid, which exhibits properties very similar to the other five binary acids, and is in fact the strongest among them. However, it is limited in use due to its ready decomposition into elemental hydrogen and astatine,Fairbrother, Peter, \\"Re: Is hydroastatic acid possible?\\", accessed July 3, 2009. as well as the short half-life of the various isotopes of astatine. Because the atoms have a nearly equal electronegativity, and as the At+ ion has been observed,Advances in Inorganic Chemistry, Volume 6 by Emeleus, p.219, Academic Press, 1964 dissociation could easily result in the hydrogen carrying the negative charge. Thus, a hydrogen astatide sample can undergo the following reaction: :2 HAt ‚Üí H+ \\\\+ At‚àí \\\\+ H‚àí \\\\+ At+ ‚Üí H2 \\\\+ At2 This results in elemental hydrogen gas and astatine precipitate. Further, a trend for hydrogen halides, or HX, is that enthalpy of formation becomes less negative, i.e., decreases in magnitude but increases in absolute terms, as the halide becomes larger. Whereas hydroiodic acid solutions are stable, the hydronium-astatide solution is clearly less stable than the water-hydrogen-astatine system. Finally, radiolysis from astatine nuclei could sever the H-At bonds. Additionally, astatine has no stable isotopes. The most stable is astatine-210, which has a half-life of approximately 8.1 hours, making its chemical compounds especially difficult to work with,Gagnon, Steve, \\"It's Elemental\\", accessed July 3, 2009. as the astatine will quickly decay into other elements.

He was \\"the fifth member\\", involved in album cover conception and graphic design, bringing in Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Lynn Goldsmith and Franky Boy. He also managed tour production. He signed T√©l√©phone at Path√© Marconi. He met Philippe Constantin, whose musical knowledge pleased him and who became his closest friend. Shortly after signing the contract, in November 1977, T√©l√©phone released its first album. It went gold in a few months. The band sold millions of albums over the years. In 1980 Ravard established the \\"Telephone Music\\" a publishing company. He was one of the first to invest money in video promos (with such director as Julian Temple who made Argent trop cher and √ßa or Jean-Baptiste Mondino Un autre mooned). Ravard signed the band to a deal with Virgin UK and hired a British booking agent to get dates outside France. Fran√ßois Ravard handled A&R; for toward Anglo-Saxon producers including Mike Thorne, Martin Rushent, Bob Ezrin and Glynn Johns. In 1985, due to internal tension, the band split up.

He produced short films and three feature films: Divine enfant by Jean-Pierre Mocky (1988), Stan the Flasher by Serge Gainsbourg (1990), La Pagaille, de Pascal Thomas (1991). In 1994, while sharing office with Philippe Constantin, the latter introduced him to Marianne Faithfull. Ravard became her impresario, manager and A&R; person. He encouraged her work in theater, cinema, recordings, tours and readings. Faithfull got the leading role in Black Rider. Fran√ßois Ravard then worked with her on the 20th Century Blues album, followed by a worldwide tour: An Evening in the Weimar Republic. Faithfull then recorded Seven Deadly Sins. The show appeared in opera theaters all over the world. For the Vagabond Ways album, Ravard suggested the Roger Waters song Flower Child and Elton John For Wanting You. For the album Kissin Time, he brought in collaborators Blur, Billy Corgan, Beck, Dave Stewart and Jarvis Cocker. On Before the Poison he arranged contributions from PJ Harvey and Nick Cave. Ravard co-produced the Dream'in My Dream documentary, as well as Live In Hollywood. He encouraged Faithfull to work with Patrice Ch√©reau (Intimacy) and Sofia Coppola (Marie-Antoinette).

In the US and Britain the most widespread genus name for otodontids with serrated teeth is Carcharocles, and the owners of unserrated ones Otodus. In countries of the former USSR, like Ukraine or Russia, all of these genera were attributed to Otodus, because scientists like Zhelezko and Kozlov thought that the absence or presence of tooth serrations is not enough to place these sharks in different taxa.

In 2007, the creative team established the Liverpool Carnival Company with an aim of delivering a Carnival event the following year. 2008-2010 The first official Carnival Parade took place on Saturday 2 August 2008 as part of the European Capital of Culture celebrations with over 500 performers from across the UK, Brazil (Mangueira), the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and Spain taking part. The Parade led to an evening street party held at iconic Liverpool music venue The Picket. A similar event followed on Saturday 1 August in 2009 and at the slightly earlier date of Saturday 17 July in 2010. In 2010, the first Carnival Queen competition was held which went on to become a popular annual fixture in the festival calendar. 2010 Parade Participants: * Sambatuc (Paris) * Paraiso School of Samba (London) * Oy√° Batucada (Birmingham) * Republic of Swing (Manchester) * Cordoa de Ouro Capoeira (Liverpool/Manchester) * Oxiris (Wirral) * Manchester School of Samba * Batala Liverpool * Liverpool Samba school * St Peter and Paul‚Äôs Samba Group (Widnes) 2011-2012 Crowds in Williamson Square at Brazilica Festival 2012In 2011, it was decided to expand the annual Parade into a weekend of activity celebrating the culture of Brazil in greater depth. It is from this point the festival became known as 'Brazilica'. One of the most notable additions to the festival was the positioning of a music stage, Latin American food festival and market place in the city centre location of Williamson Square that took place on the same day as the annual Carnival Parade. Instead of finishing at The Picket (as in previous years) the Parade came to an end at Williamson Square where performers took to the stage to close the festival. In anticipation of Brazil playing host to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the festival also hosts a Soccer Zone in the Clayton Square area of the city centre. The programme has been delivered by Liverpool F.C., Liverpool AFC, Liverpool Homeless FC and Brazilian Soccer Schools since 2011. The festival also continued to host its annual Carnival Queen dance competition and, in 2011, hosted its inaugural Carnival Ball event. Both remain popular annual events taking place during the festival. In 2012, Brazilica Festival teamed up with Festinho to open the weekend with a club night at Cream Nightclub featuring DJs including Norman Jay and DJ Marky. By 2012, the festival had attracted over 80,000 visitors making it officially the largest Samba Carnival in the UK. 2013 ‚Äì present An announcement was made in October 2012 that Brazilica 2013 would expand into a week-long cultural festival, taking place from Friday 12 July - Friday 19 July 2013 and that the annual city centre Samba Carnival and Parade would take place on Saturday 20 July 2013. 2013 Parade Participants: * Sargento Pimenta (Rio) * Paraiso School of Samba (London) * London School of Samba (London) * Rhythms of the City (London) * Liverpool Samba School (Liverpool) * Manchester School of Samba (Manchester) * Hull Samba (Hull) * Oxiris (Wirral) * Karamba Samba (Chester) * Grupo Sambafriq (Chorley) * Batala Liverpool (Liverpool) * Arco Iris (Cambridge) * Oya Batucada (Birmingham) * Nottingham School of Samba (Nottingham) References Brazilica Festival Category:Brazilian diaspora in the United Kingdom Brazilica Festival Brazilica Festival ","title":"Brazilica Festival"},{"id":"32452459","title":"GER Class E72"},{"id":"32452477","text":"Harry Albemarle Swepstone (14 January 1859 ‚Äì 7 May 1907) was an English international footballer, who played as a goalkeeper.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Cornell University. As a student, he worked as an exercise rider for, among others, Hall of Fame trainer James E. Fitzsimmons. Gerard started practice as a veterinarian for racehorses, some highly successful ones, such as Canonero II, who won the Kentucky Derby. In 1977, he masterminded a highly publicized scandal involving horse switching. He had imported two horses from Uruguay, a champion named Cinzano, and the much cheaper Lebon. After Lebon had under- performed in his earlier races, Gerard ran Cinzano in its name. Cinzano subsequently won, as a 57-1 outsider, at New York's Belmont Park, and Gerard collected a $77,920 winning on a bet. Later, a Uruguayan journalist recognized the horse as Cinzano from a newspaper photo, and an investigation was started. The story was broken in the States on October 21, 1977 by News Worlds racing editor, Daniel Keating in New York. When John Piesen of the New York Post told Keating that he had broken a story on October 23rd, Keating told him he broke it two days ago. Keating also asked Rupert Murdoch to cease claiming the Post had broken the story. Nothing happened. In September 1978, Gerard, represented by attorney F. Lee Bailey, testified that Lebon had \\"died in an accident at Gerard's New York farm the day he and Cinzano arrived from Uruguay\\", and his wife testified that she had switched horses without his knowledge. Gerard was convicted of fraud, then fined $1,000 and sentenced to one year in prison, which was shortened on appeal, otherwise retaining his ill-gotten gains.

From 1934 he worked at the Frankfurter Zeitung, first as a music critic, then from 1938 as editor of its literary section. The government closed the newspaper in 1943, and Dirks was forbidden (Schreiberverbot) to publish any of his writing. He began work at the Catholic publisher Verlag Herder.German Wikipedia: Walter Dirks. Dirks is the author of several dozen books. He was active in the post-war reconstruction of the city of Frankfurt. Dirks also participated in forming a new political party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), joining Protestants and Catholics.From 1949 to 1963 the CDU was led by Adenauer formerly of the Zentrumpartie. The CDU became known for fielding center-right candidates. Cf., Fritz Stern. Five Germanys I have known (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux 2006), pp. 195-196. In a 1946 article, Eugen Kogon, Clemens M√ºnster, and Walter Dirks advanced the vision of a Christian socialist future for a democratic Germany.French Wikipedia: Walter Dirks. The CDU, however, took another direction.Peter H. Merkl, The origin of the west German republic (Oxford Univ. 1963), pp. 104-105. After 1948 the CDU Finance Minister saw an opening to favor free enterprise. An \\"economic boom\\" followed that supplied consumer goods. \\"In the CDU/CSU the business wing replaced the labor wing in control.\\" From 1946 Dirks was co-editor of Die Frankfurter Hefte.Gerd-Rainer Horn and Emmanuel Gerard, Left Catholicism, 1943-1955: Catholics and Society in Western Europe at the Point of Liberation, KADOC-studies 25, Leuven: Leuven University Press, 2001, , pp. 196-202. At Sudwestfunk, a public radio corporation, from 1949 Dirks was a political commentator on domestic issues. During 1953-1956 he worked with Theodor Adorno at the Institut fur Sozialforschung (IfS), then home of the Frankfurt School of social criticism. From 1956 to 1967 he was manager in Cologne of public television Westdeutscher Rundfunk. He co-founded in 1966 the Bensberger Kreis, a circle of Catholic intellectuals.German Wikipedia: Walter Dirks; (where Ernst-Wolfgang B√∂ckenf√∂rde was a member). Dirks, an advocate for socialism, was an opponent of nuclear weapons and rearmament. With other writers such as Eugen Kogon in Die Frankfurter Hefte, he articulated these positions.Alice Holmes Cooper, Paradoxes of Peace: German Peace Movements Since 1945, Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1996, , pp. 67-69 From the 1960s until the end of his life, Dirks' political orientation and point of view was in the minority among German Catholics. Gustav Heinemann the President referred to him as a moral conscience of the community.French Wikipedia: Walter Dirks. Gustav Heinemann (SPD) was President of the BRD, 1969-1974. In 1941 he married Marianne Ostertag (1913-1991), (German Wikipedia). who later served on the Central Committee of German Catholics (ZdK). Marxism and Christianity A 1947 journal piece by Dirks, \\"Marxismus in christlicher Sicht\\",English: \\"Marxism from a Christian point of view\\" published in Die Frankfurter Hefte (February 1947). acquired great influence. On the subject of Communism, it was the \\"decisive essay for the whole post-war German Christian thinking\\". Addressed were positive similarities between the prophetic passages of the young Marx and the Christian gospel of love and community. Marx was first to identify with the realities of proletarian life, which Dirks saw as an act of love. Dirks wrote of this \\"radical thinking out of the existence of the helpless and exploited\\" and of Marx's \\"essentially Christian act... of solidarity with the other, with the neighbor, a sacrifice\\".Charles C. West, Communism and the Theologians. Study of an encounter (London: SCM Press 1958; New York: Macmillan [pb 1963]), pp. 104-107 (at 105: West's \\"decisive\\" quote, Dirks' \\"radical\\" and \\"essentially\\" quotes) & 110, 331-333; cf. 247 (per Helmut Gollwitzer); Marx as first per factory worker poverty (105-106, 247, 331-332).Jean-Yves Para√Øso, \\"Walter Dirks und der junge Marx: Zu Walter Dirks' Aufsatz 'Marxismus in christlicher Sicht'\\", Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte, v. 7/2, pp. 319-335 (1994). Accessed 2020-9-27. In terms moral and spiritual Marx had described the \\"human relations in producing\\" and \\"the real world of power conflicts and selfish drives, without idealizing it.\\" Marx thus widened the scope of the social justice project. As did then the Lutheran theologian Paul Tillich, Dirks saw beyond his inheritance of bourgeois idealism, looking forward. Yet, unlike Tillich who countered Communism with a 'religious socialism', Dirks understood Communism as another faith. Accordingly, he faulted Marx for an Hegelian pantheism and for confusing spirit and ideology. Despite the prophetic quality of the early Marx, Dirks did not assume that he was \\"the appointed bearer of an historic promise\\". Rather, the moral claim on the Christian was to acknowledge, to listen to, and to minister to the working class. The project was to assist the exploited \\"until he can solve problems better and think better than the Communist\\". Dirks called on Christian churches for a responsive commitment, and renewed vigor.West, Communism and the Theologians (1958, [pb 1963]), 104-107 (107: West's \\"until\\" quote) & 110 (West's \\"human relations\\" and \\"real world\\" quotes, and \\"appointed\\" quote), 247, 331-333; bourgeois idealism (105-106, 332), call on churches (107, 247, 332-333); Tillich, 78-87, 91-104. The Monk and the World Dirks hereSee bibliography: 1952, translated 1954. describes himself as a lay Catholic Christian, mentioning other like authors: Chesterton, Belloc, Bloy, Hello, and the novelist Bernanos (p.2). He introduces his book as one intending to show what benefit comes to the secular world from the monks. The point of view taken is journalistic. He tells it \\"from a personal way of thinking that seeks\\" a pathway through secular realities to \\"develop a consciousness\\" of the unity, so that one may share in \\"the true entirety of the history of God\\" (p.31). How do we laity benefit from the witness of monks? They live their lives in common, under vows of poverty, obedience and chastity. To answer the question we must comprehend how this life style \\"deviates so astonishingly from the norm of human existence\\" (p.33). In the main, Dirks offers brief narratives of the major founders of monastic institutions: St. Benedict, St. Francis, St. Dominic, and St. Ignatius. Each began in part as an answer to a historical challenge (pp. 71-73). About St. Francis (pp. 152-181), Dirks historically situates the start of the Franciscan order when medieval societies began to transform into urban business cultures (pp. 164-167). Buying and selling became a focus in the evolving role of the merchant. Hence the laity faced novel situations. St. Francis is quoted expressing the connection between violence and property: >> >>> \\"Sir, if we had property, we would need weapons for our protection. For from property, litigation and quarrels arise, and through these the love of God and one's neighbor is greatly diminished. And so in this world we desire no property whatever\\" (p.162).Reference to Karl Marx made here, and at p.168. >> >> As Dirks sees it, the mission of St. Francis was to the wealthy. His was not a movement of the poor against the rich, although he recognized the contradiction between the hierarchy's wealth and the admonitions of Jesus. The perplexing thing (then and now) was that St. Francis preached poverty, \\"Lady Poverty\\", to the rich. To be sure, he urged the rich to give alms, yet the \\"threat to the rich man from his wealth caused him much greater anxiety\\" (p.163). St. Francis saw that \\"the nature of wealth had changed. ... that riches were striking root in men's hearts in a different way. ...it had become more intimately precious\\" (p.165). The merchant was put \\"in the slow process of learning how to separate workaday atheistic behavior from devout observance\\" and \\"under these conditions he was imperiled\\" (p.166).Also discussed: the Third Order, 155-156, 164, 171-175.

As with his 1974 debut solo album Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead it consists entirely of songs, rather than the comedy-narrative-with-integral-songs of its immediate predecessor Sir Henry at Rawlinson End. Background Teddy Boys Don't Knit was written during Stanshall‚Äôs residence at his Thames river houseboat Searchlight with his second wife Ki Longfellow, his stepdaughter Sydney and his infant daughter Silky - a period which Longfellow has described as Stanshall‚Äôs \\"first, real and only taste of family life.\\"Album information on Teddy Boys Don't Knit from www.gingergeezer.com homepage Consequently, several songs on the album have domestic themes: \\"The Tube\\" (written for and about Silky Stanshall and her infant digestive process), \\"Bewilderbeeste\\" and \\"Calypso to Colapso\\" (for and about his love of Ki), \\"Fresh Faced Boys\\" (dealing with Stanshall‚Äôs struggle against his own father‚Äôs wishes for him to be well-groomed, well-behaved and socially presentable) and \\"Possibly an Armchair\\", in which Stanshall muses on ageing and on whether in old age he is likely to become the same kind of person as his elderly father had himself become. The album was recorded at Morgan Studios, Willesden Green in 1981 and released in between Stanshall's two spoken-word comedy albums, Sir Henry at Rawlinson End and Sir Henry at N'didi‚Äôs Kraal (and shortly after the shooting of the film version of Sir Henry at Rawlinson End). Although not part of the Rawlinson End sequence in itself, Teddy Boys Don't Knit does feature several songs written (and in some cases used) for the project: \\"Gums\\", \\"The Cracks Are Showing\\" and \\"Terry Keeps His Clips On\\" (a song inspired by Terry clips). Several other songs emphasize Stanshall‚Äôs love of language and language games. The title of \\"Flung a Dummy\\" is taken from an unusual phrase which Stanshall had heard a stranger on a train use as a synonym for dying, while \\"Ginger Geezer\\" is written almost entirely in Cockney rhyming slang. Other songs parody and mock the lifestyle of the rock-and-roll musician. As he had on Men Opening Umbrellas Ahead, Stanshall made use of the musical talents of his fellow former Bonzo Dog Band members Neil Innes and Roger Ruskin Spear, his frequently-called-on musical director Pete Moss and multi-instrumentalist Jim Cuomo.

She was born at Dorchester, the third daughter of William Barnes, the Dorsetshire poet, by his wife Julia Miles. She began writing at eighteen, and from the small profits of stories and magazine articles saved enough to visit Italy, a cherished ambition. There she met and in 1867 married Samuel Thomas Baxter (1810‚Äì1903), a member of a family long settled in Florence, which then became her home. For thirty-five years she was a well-known figure in the literary and artistic life of the city, and in 1882 was elected an honorary member of the Accademia delle Belle Arti. For thirteen years her residence was the Villa Bianca, outside Florence, in the direction of Vincigliata (near Fiesole) and Settignano. Among those with whom she was associated in literary research was John Temple Leader, a wealthy English resident at Florence, who owned the castle of Vincigliata. Her literary pseudonym of ‚ÄòLeader Scott‚Äô combined the maiden surnames of her two grandmothers, Isabel Leader being her mother‚Äôs mother and Grace Scott the mother of her father. Her principal publication was The Cathedral Builders (1899 and 1900), an important examination of the whole field of Romanesque architecture in relation to the Comacine masons. Her biographer for the DNB observed that: > though necessarily based on Merzario‚Äôs I Maestri Comacini, the book shows > much original observation and research and, if its arguments are not always > conclusive, the international scope of the work and its wealth of > illustration render it a storehouse of information and a useful introduction > to an unfrequented field of speculation. The intention of the work was to > attribute the entire genesis of mediaeval architecture to masonic guilds > derived, so it is supposed, from the Roman Collegia. Apart from this work and numerous magazine articles, she published: * A Nook in the Apennines, 1879. * Fra Bartolommeo and Andrea del Sarto, 1881. * Ghiberti and Donatello, 1882 * Luca della Robbia, 1883 * Messer Agnolo‚Äôs Household, 1883. * Renaissance of Art in Italy, 1883 * A Bunch of Berries, Bungay, 1885 * Sculpture, Renaissance and Modern, 1886 * Life of William Barnes, 1887 * Tuscan Studies and Sketches, 1887 * Vincigliata and Maiano, Florence and London, 1891 * The Orti Oricellari, Florence, 1893 * Echoes of Old Florence, Florence and London, 1894 * The Castle of Vincigliata, Florence, 1897 * The Renunciation of Helen, 1898 * Filippo di Ser Brunellesco, 1901 * Correggio, 1902. She translated from Italian: * Sir John Hawkwood by John Temple Leader and G. Marcotti (1889).

Traditionally the club has a working class history that has overcome many obstacles to provide an opportunity for local children and adults to enjoy Rugby League. The Corrimal team is represented by a Cougar, and their emblem displays this creature in front of a red background in the shape of football. The name \\"Cougars\\" was chosen following a competition involving local school children. Robyn Fletcher of East Corrimal Public School was the winner. Underneath the name is the inscription \\"Est. 1912\\". Their colours are Green and Red. The Cougars play out of Ziems Park, Corrimal. Ziems Park Ziems park was officially opened as the home ground of the Corrimal Cougars Rugby League Club on Saturday 14 April 1934. With Corrimal defeating Thirroul 5‚Äì0 for the Grant Gup, the Grant Cup was donated by Corrimal Hotel publican John Grant for the occasion. The Ziems family originally own the land and used it as an abattoir for their local butcher shop but in the early 1930 Arthur Ziems, spoke to members of his family about donating the land to the rugby league club. The family agreed on condition that the club fence of the land to be used for rugby league. In 1970 the ground underwent major improvements including the banks around the main oval with the help of the South Bulli Mine's community relation project to become regarded as one of the best grounds in the Illawarra district.

CUofSS consists of two campuses; one in the capital of Juba, while the other is located in the city of Wau. The university is fairly new as it was established and operating since 2008. However, the university was founded approximately three years before the independence of South Sudan. History In July 2007, five bishops from Sudan decided to establish a Catholic university that would have campuses and institutions in both northern and southern Sudan. The Catholic University of South Sudan opened with 50 pioneer students on 29 September 2008, as a private institution of higher education. In its first year of operation of the 2008‚Äì2009 academic year, the school enrolled 250 students, which is reported to be a high number for a country like that. The Jesuit Father Michael Schultheis served as its first vice-chancellor (2008‚Äì2013), followed by Dr fr. Matthew Pagan Daniel. In 2013, the campus in Wau started a project establishing new areas of study, including mineralogy and mining studies. The campus fully instituted these by 2014. Location and faculties The university's main campus is located in the city of Juba, Jubek State, in the southern region of South Sudan. The city of Juba is the capital of South Sudan and is the largest city in the country. The university maintains a second campus in the city of Wau, Wau State, which is approximately northwest of Juba. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences is located in Juba. However, the Faculties of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences and Engineering is based in the city of Wau. The second campus in Wau also offers mining and mineralogy studies, implemented by 2014. School description The university offers fine arts classes, including art and social sciences, and also science related classes, including agricultural sciences, economic sciences, engineering, mineralogy, and mining classes. The school has a container library, which was donated to the school in 2009.

Within the narrative framework of the novel, Captain Paxton, United States Army Infantry, is a fan of Burroughs' Barsoom series, and after having a shell blow off his legs during trench warfare in World War I, he finds himself drawn across the gulfs of space to Mars (where his body is whole again) like John Carter before him. He sends Burroughs a first person manuscript of his adventures on the dying planet, which Burroughs publishes. On Mars, Paxton is taken in by elderly mad scientist Ras Thavas, the \\"Master Mind\\" of the novel's title, who educates him in the ways of Barsoom and bestows on him the Martian name Vad Varo. Ras has perfected techniques of transplanting brains, which he uses to provide rich elderly Martians with youthful new bodies for a profit. Distrustful of his fellow Martians, he trains Paxton as his assistant to perform the same operation on him. But Paxton has fallen in love with Valla Dia, one of Ras' young victims, whose body has been swapped for that of the hag Xaxa, Jeddara (empress) of the city-state of Phundahl. He refuses to operate on Ras until his mentor promises to restore her to her rightful body. A quest for that body ensues, in which Paxton is aided by others of Ras' experimental victims, and in the end (and after meeting fellow Earthman John Carter) he attains the hand of his Valla Dia, who in a happy plot twist turns out to be a princess. Further appearances In the following novel, A Fighting Man of Mars, Paxton relays Tan Hadron of Hastor's adventure to Burroughs on Earth via the Gridley Wave (named after Jason Gridley, a character in Burroughs' Pellucidar series). Paxton is not involved in this story's plot, other than the framing device of transcribing and relaying it. Paxton is also mentioned at the beginning of Synthetic Men of Mars. When Dejah Thoris is badly injured in an accident and Ras Thavas, the only surgeon that can possibly help her, has gone missing without a trace, John Carter decides to seek out Paxton instead, hoping that, as Ras Thavas' former student, he can perform the surgery. He is however captured by the Hormads before he has a chance to locate Paxton, and Paxton himself is again not involved in the plot.

It is a return to the largely spoken-word, solo comedy format of Stanshall's second album Sir Henry at Rawlinson End and is a sequel to the same work. Background Sir Henry at N'didi's Kraal continues the story of the dissolute aristocrat and explorer Sir Henry Rawlinson, this time dealing with his attempts on behalf of the \\"Geographic Society\\" to locate a lost tribe of Zulus in South Africa. In contrast to Sir Henry at Rawlinson End, it is almost entirely spoken word, with only one song included. The album is predominantly a parody of the colonial manners and attitudes of the British Empire, using Sir Henry as a mouthpiece for various ridiculous and sometimes racist philosophies which Stanshall could spoof. It has been described as \\"a contradictory mix of Sir Henry's belief in racial superiority and (Stanshall's) genuine affection for African culture.\\" The album was recorded at a low point in Stanshall's life following his separation from his second wife Ki Longfellow and their young family, during which he was suffering from severe alcohol and prescription medicine abuse. Stanshall was unhappy with the album's unpolished content, editing and low production values and subsequently disowned it.

Although Stanshall would continue to produce one- off recordings, advertisements and the comic opera Stinkfoot, Sir Henry at N'didi's Kraal would be his final album.

History On 2 March 1882, the Comiss√£o dos Far√≥is e Balizas (Commission on Lighthouses and Beacons) released the first plans for the installation of a lighthouse in Ponta das Contendas, equipped with a second- order lantern, that would illuminate a 240¬∞ focal range with 4 clarions (three white and one red). A year later, there was a determination that Ponta de S√£o Jorge would be a better candidate. By 1902 the lighthouse had not yet been built. A new commission judged that Ponta de S√£o Jorge was too obscure, and judged that a more convenient site would be Ponta das Contendas. The revised project substituted the second-order lantern for a fifth-order light, with six clarions. A parcel of land owned by Manuel Ferreira Louren√ßa was purchased in 1926 for 1200$00 r√©is (equivalent to 6 euros). Finally, in 1930, the construction of the lighthouse began, under the direction of Ant√≥nio Tomaz. On 1 February 1934, the completed lighthouse was inaugurated, with the installed third-order lamp (with a 500-millimetre focal distance). At the inauguration: > After all the preparations and at the arrival of the hour, the lighthouse > chief lit and put into function the optics, His Excellency the Captain of > the Port gave a speech to the people. The mechanism allowed for a fifteen-second beacon interval, using an incandescent bulb powered by petroleum gas, resulting in a visible range of . On 1 June 1958, the beacon was electrified. The new electric bulb increased the light's visible range to . In 1964, a paved road to the lighthouse and connections to the public water system were finally completed. The lighthouse began to operate with a 1,000-watt/120-volt lamp in 1983, reducing its range to , or 23 nautical miles. This was followed in 1985 by the introduction of a two-sector red lamp, with the objective of assisting navigation in the most dangerous sectors, including those near the islets of Fradinhos. In 1998, the connection to the public electrical network was completed. On 1 February 2009, the lighthouse celebrated 75 years of operation on the Contendas Point. Presiding over the ceremony were representatives of the Portuguese and Azorean governments, the Maritime Department, and the Captain of the Port Authority of Angra do Hero√≠smo. Invited guests included the president of the local government, the Commandant of the Command Zone of the Azores, commander of the Air Base No. 4, U.S. Forces Commander, the President of the Historical Institute of Terceira, and other representatives of local authorities. Public activities which accompanied the speeches included the unveiling of an azulejo to mark the anniversary, the activation of a private radio transmitter, visits by 500 children from 14 schools in Angra do Hero√≠smo, Porto Judeu, S√£o Sebasti√£o, Praia da Vit√≥ria, Areeiro-Fontinhas, Vila Nova, Agualva, Outeiro, and general guided tours with a film \\"Far√≥is de Portugal, cinco s√©culos de hist√≥ria\\". Architecture Located along the maritime coast, in the south- east corner of the island of Terceira, called Ponta das Contendas, it is situated in an elevated zone, resulting in a focal point that is 54 metres above sea level. Although protected by a wall, the lighthouse (ARLHS AZO-007; PT-745; Admiralty D2664; NGA 23532) is on the edge of a high cliff, and accessible only from the Estrada 509, alongside several agricultural fields. Its plan is composed of four inter-connected rectangular rooms connected by a central body (taking the form of a \\"H\\"), on which the main 13-metre-high prismatic white tower is surmounted by a red cupola. The lighthouse building complex consists of three spaces for lighthouse-keepers, two cisterns, an office and inspection room. The first floor terrace gives access to the tower, through two narrow openings, to the terrace, and from there to the dome structure, which is manufactured steel topped by a weather-vane. The building, which is circled by a cornice and terrace, is painted white. The light terrace and the lamp housing atop the building are painted red. The structure is interspersed with square sash windows and sills. It is illuminated by crystal optic, with a third-order Fresnel rotation beacon, with a 500-millimetre focal length. The light characteristic is four flashes every fifteen seconds (Gp Fl.(4)W.R. 15s), white on 220¬∞‚Äì020¬∞ and 044¬∞‚Äì072¬∞ and red otherwise. It is visible for .

Various long-distance track events are involved. The most well known of these is the 100 km Ultra marathon which began in 1959 and is one of the biggest and oldest of its kind (only a 1x100 km loop). You can do the run alone, as a couple or in a Team of 5. The Ultra marathon is also a part of the European Ultramarathon Cup. Along with the 100 km Ultra marathon there are a night marathon and a half marathon taking place.  Route  The start for all distances is at the ‚ÄúKongresshaus‚Äù in Biel/Bienne. The 100 km run starts on Friday night at 10pm and the marathon and half marathon at 10.30pm. The route takes the participants through the cities and towns of Biel/Bienne, Nidau, Port, Bellmund, Jens and Kappelen to Aarberg, a medieval town made more special by the atmosphere created by the thousands of spectators. It is in Aarberg where the half marathon runners cross the finish line. After it is onto Lyss where the Ultra marathon participants may have a supporter on a bike join them. The route then continues onto Grossaffoltern and Scheunenberg then through to the Limpach Valley to Balm bei Messen and Oberramsern which brings the race to kilometre 39. Here in Oberramsern is the finish line for the night marathon. The night marathon route is the same as the 100 km except that the runners have done an additional loop through Biel/Bienne. The 100 km runners start to head South now to M√ºlchi, Etzelkofen and Jegenstorf where they will soon hit the 50 km mark. They continue onto Kernenried and Kirchberg. Then it is time for the runners and their bike support to separate for 10 km as they bumpy track on the Emme river begins. This part of the route has been nicknamed the Ho Chi Minh trail by previous participants. When the fastest runners reach here it is still dark out and due to branches and big stones on the path most runners will have a head lamp to help them. Just before Gerlafingen the narrow path ends and the bike supporters can rejoin their runner. Over Biberist, L√ºterkofen-Ichertswil and Bibern the run continues to Arch and the Aare river. The route then follows the Aare approximately 10 km past B√ºren. The last kilometres go past Br√ºgg direction Biel/Bienne until the finish line in the city of Biel. Last possible finish time is Saturday at 7pm, 21 hours after the start.

The Private Apartments of the Winter Palace are sited on the piano nobile of the western wing of the former imperial palace, the Winter Palace in St Petersburg. Access to the private rooms, for members of the Imperial Family, from the exterior was usually through the Saltykov Entrance (centre in the photograph to the right) which was reserved for use by only the Tsar, Tsaritsa and grand dukes and grand duchesses. A second access was through a discrete box-like porch, on the western end of the Palace's Neva fa√ßade. From the ground floor, it can be accessed from the October Staircase, formerly known as His Majesty's Own Staircase; this double-flighted imperial staircase was a secondary entrance to the private apartments, and provided a more convenient route to the palace's ground floor and private entrances than the more formal and ceremonial public route through the state apartments. During the October Revolution of 1917, this was the entrance by which the revolutionaries gained access to the palace in order to arrest the Provisional Government in the small private dining room. Since that date it has been known as the October Staircase and has a plaque commemorating the event. Despite its size and grandeur, the October Staircase was a secondary staircase, the Jordan Staircase being the principal. From the palace's more formal rooms, the private apartments are entered through the rotunda, a circular room which served as an ante and waiting room for those to be received by the Tsar. Another entrance is from the Malachite Drawing Room, which served as both a private and state room, and was often the assembly point for the beginning of imperial processions from the neighbouring Arabian Hall which led to the principal state apartments - particularly for imperial weddings, when the bride would be formally dressed in the Romanoff wedding regalia by the Tsaritsa in the Malachite Drawing Room. The private rooms overlook a lawned and wooded garden, created from a former parade ground by the last Empress of Russia, who wanted a private place for her children to play. Until 1917, this wing was rather like a private house within a palace; it was used by the Imperial Family whenever in residence. Following a severe fire in 1837 when most of the palace was destroyed, the private apartments were rebuilt in various styles according to the tastes of their intended, individual occupants, the immediate family of Tsar Nicholas I; thus they are an array of eclectic styles and loose interpretations of earlier 18th century tastes and fashions. During the reigns of the following three Tsars many changes were made in decoration and use, but the layout remained essentially unchanged. In 1904, the last Tsar Nicholas II and his family abandoned the Winter Palace in favour of the more private Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo. From this date until the fall of the monarchy, the Winter Palace was used only for formal state occasions. It was in the Private wing of the Winter Palace, following the February Revolution of 1917, that the Russian Provisional Government established itself. A few months later during the October Revolution this was the area of the palace most damaged during the famous Storming of the Winter Palace, a defining moment in Russia's history. The plan used (right) is based on the arrangement of rooms prior to 1917; it has since been altered to accommodate the palace's use today as part of the complex of buildings which comprise the State Hermitage Museum. Many of the former private rooms are not regularly open to the public, or have been much changed. The piano nobile of the Winter Palace. The private apartments are shaded pink.

Apartments of Nicholas I and Alexandra Feodorovna The Rotunda (28 on the plan). This circular, domed hall, dating from the early 19th century, links the state and private rooms of the palace, and in its design represents the final and neoclassical stage of the palace's evolution. The apartments of Nicholas I and his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, were in the northwest corner of the palace, a suite traditionally occupied by the monarch since the time of Catherine the Great, and now form part of the Apartments of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna. Catherine the Great had her throne room here, before Giacomo Quarenghi completed the building of the larger St George's Hall in the eastern wing in 1787, suggesting that rooms were formerly less intimate and private than they latterly became. During the 1780s, the interior design of the palace was changed from the ornate rococo designed by Francesco Rastrelli to the simpler Neoclassical decoration still prevalent in the state rooms today; the private rooms, however, seem to have been frequently redecorated according to the (often simple) tastes of their occupants; and in terms of decoration, luxury and use they do not correspond to the Petit appartement du roi at Versailles or to the Private Apartments at the Hofburg Palace, in Vienna, or at Windsor Castle. Following the fire of 1837, Nicholas I was responsible for the rapid rebuilding of the palace. He insisted that the exterior remain unchanged, but allowed large parts of the interior to be redesigned in a variety of tastes and styles, leading the palace to be described as \\"A 19th-century palace inspired by a model in rococo style.\\" Maria Alexandrovna Several eminent architects were employed to rebuild the palace, most notably Vasily Stasov, who was charged with the rebuilding of the state rooms in identical or similar styles to that which had been before, and Alexander Brullov. It is Brullov who is most closely associated with the private apartments. Able to work competently in a variety of styles, his commission was to rebuild the private and semi-private rooms according to the tastes of their intended occupants. The architects involved in the rebuilding of the palace were able to take advantage of construction developments not available to Rastrelli and Quarenghi in their original plans. Following the fire, it was discovered that large quantities of wood and hidden voids had been one of the reasons the fire had spread so drastically. In order to avoid a repeat of this, hidden behind the new but classical fa√ßades, the architects were able to use the latest techniques in building. These included the large-scale use of steel to support the vast ceiling spans of the Baroque state rooms, avoiding the need for supporting columns. However, in the smaller rooms the ceilings were built with less flammable brick vaults, which were to have a significant effect on Brullov's decorative schemes for the private rooms. Vaulting lent itself to both Gothic and Byzantine forms of interior design. Nowhere in the palace is the Gothic more evident than in the ground floor drawing room created by Brullov in 1838 for the daughters of Nicholas I. Later the architect Andrei Stakenschneider was employed to carry out many projects at the palace. He decorated the crimson boudoir of the Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna in a Rococo revival that Quarenghi had all but eradicated from the palace 70 years earlier. Apartments of Alexander II and Tsaritsa Maria Alexandrovna Memorial bust to Alexander II placed on the spot where he died in 1881. The Crimson Cabinet, the study of Maria Alexandrovna Tsar Alexander II died on the chaise longue by the columns This suite of rooms is at the centre and southern end of the private wing, overlooking the Admiralty and Palace Square. In the apartment of the Tsaritsa, originally rebuilt by Brullov, the hand of Andrei Stakenschneider is evident. His chief distinction was an ability to combine an eclectic mix of architectural styles, frequently combining Classical, Gothic and Oriental motifs in the same scheme. This is nowhere more obvious that in the suite created for Tsaritsa Maria Alexandrovna, where the Gold Drawing Room combines all of these motifs. Maria Alexandrovna used the Gold Drawing room as her state Drawing Room with her more private rooms beyond: the Crimson Drawing Room followed by her Boudoir, before the most private of her rooms, the bedroom. Her study, in a corner of the palace, by contrast with the preceding Gold Drawing Room was simply decorated having plain white walls adorned only with gilded sconces, and a vaulted ceiling broken onto palales by gilded moulding. By contrast again, the small boudoir beyond was in an ornate rococo revival style created by the architect Harald Bosse in 1853. Tsar's Study (14) Until the assassination of Alexander II, this room was traditionally the Tsar's study, having been used for this purpose by both Alexander I and Nicholas I. Originally designed by Giacomo Quarenghi in 1791, the room contains a recessed alcove in the style of a Baroque state bedroom, indicative of its original use. Following the fire of 1837 it was redesigned by Alexander Brullov. It was here, in March 1881, that the fatally wounded Alexander II was carried to die (on the chaise longue to the right of the picture). Following his death a memorial bust was placed on the spot where he died; this remains in place today. The room, like many of the private rooms, is accessed from the aptly named \\"dark corridor.\\" It was along this long passageway that Maria Fedorovna in her memoirs talked of following great drips of congealed blood to find the dying Tsar in his study.

Immediately after the ceremony, his mother insisted the couple make their home with her at the Anichkov Palace. There they began their married life in six small rooms. The Dowager Tsaritsa forbade the new Tsar and his wife to set up their own court until six months after her husband's death. Therefore it was not until May 1895, when the Dowager went to Copenhagen, that the couple could set up their own household, but it was first a small palace at Peterhof and then the Alexander Palace in the imperial compound at Tsarskoe Selo, which even at this early stage in their marriage and reign became their near-permanent home. The bedroom of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna photographed in 1900. From December 1895, however, the Tsar and Tsaritsa did reside for periods during the winter at the Winter Palace. They extended and redesigned the rooms which had been prepared for Nicholas, as Tsarevich two years earlier. The architect was commissioned to redecorate a suite of rooms in the northwest corner of the palace. He lowered many of the vaults, the flatter ceilings creating a more intimate atmosphere. He often employed a different era as the theme for each room, ranging from medieval to rococo and art nouveau. In style and content, the suite was intended to epitomise the domestic ethic of the couple, which was to live in an almost bourgeois fashion in small cosy home; at heart the Tsaritsa was a \\"hausfrau\\". She was criticised for her taste, which was to \\"make over in the style of an English gentlewoman, stuffing rooms with knickknacks and drowning them in chintz.\\" The court was horrified that the furniture was purchased mail order from Maples of London, while her mauve boudoir has been described as \\"a horror to all who saw it.\\" Unlike most sovereigns of the day, Nicholas II and his wife shared a bedroom (5). From this was a large bathroom (overlooking an internal courtyard) designed by the court architect, Krasovsky, which had a sunken bath reached by eight marble steps. The bath was in a recess lined with Dresden tiles. The Tsaritsa also created the private garden (35) beneath the windows of the private apartments on the site of a former parade ground. Before this, the only garden of the palace was the very overlooked one (32) created in the palace's principal courtyard for her mother-in-law a few years earlier. These two areas remain the only gardens of the palace. During the reign of Nicholas II and his wife, court life was quieter than it had ever been, due to the Tsaritsa's retiring nature and mistrust of St Petersburg's high society. In the Tsaritsa's opinion: \\"Saint Petersburg is a rotten town, and not one atom Russian.\\" Under her influence, gradually the great court receptions and balls at the Winter Palace, which humoured and cultivated the powerful nobility, came to an end, to be briefly replaced by theatricals held in the Hermitage which \\"no one enjoyed.\\" Then even the theatricals ceased. Empire (2) and Silver (3) Drawing Rooms A 19th-century view of the private wing showing projecting, canopied balconies; these along with the wall surrounding the private garden have now been removed. The Silver and Empire Drawing Rooms were part of the suite of rooms reserved for the private use of the Tsaritsa. They form an enfilade which culminates in the Malachite Drawing Room, which served as the Tsaritsa's State Drawing Room, where she gave audiences and conducted her official business. It was also in the Malachite Drawing Room that Romanov brides were traditionally robed before walking in procession through the state rooms to the Palace's Grand Church for their weddings. Originally part of the suite of Maria Feodorovna, these two drawing rooms were redesigned for Nicholas II and his wife in a French style, the Silver Drawing Room in a 19th- century interpretation of the Louis XVI style and the Empire Drawing Room in a faux Napoleonic empire style. From these rooms, the Tsaritsa was able to withdraw to still more private apartments, her boudoir, dressing room and bedroom. Study/Boudoir The former study or boudoir (4 on plan) of the Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna (wife of Nicholas II) was redesigned for her by Alexander Krasovsky between 1894 and 1895. The room had previously formed the private suite of the wife of Nicholas I when, as her boudoir, it was decorated in red. For Nicholas I, devoted to his wife, spending an evening in this room with her was one of his favourite pastimes. Today the room displays the work of Heinrich Gambs, a notable Russian cabinet maker of the early 19th century. Gothic Library The Gothic library designed by Krasovsky for Nicholas II The Gothic library (9 on the plan) is the largest room of the suite refurbished for Nicholas II by Krasovsky; he designed it in a form of heavy Puginesque wooden gothic, redolent of romantic perceptions of the Middle Ages. Elsewhere, he employed themes ranging from the rococo to art nouveau. The library and the small dining rooms are the only rooms to retain their Krasovsky decoration. Many of the rooms formerly belonging to Nicholas II are small, narrow, dark and awkward in design, especially Nicholas's narrow study. Small Dining Room (8) His Majesty's Own Staircase (today the October Staircase), which gives access to the private apartments from the ground floor. It was used by revolutionaries during the storming of the palace. Formerly known as the Pompeian Dining Room, the Small Dining-room was redecorated in 1894-95 for the newly married Nicholas II and his Tsaritsa, by Krasovsky. A rococo plaster-work style was chosen to frame 18th-century St Petersburg tapestries. Above the fireplace is a plaque recording the facts of the arrest of the Provisional Government which took place in this room on the night of 25 October 1917. Private apartments and the Hermitage Museum Following the Government's arrest in the Small Dining Room, an eyewitness account records a systematic destruction of the apartments by the Bolsheviks: > The Palace was pillaged and devastated from top to bottom by the > Bolshevik[s]...Priceless pictures were ripped from their frames by bayonets. > Packed boxes of rare plate and china...were broken open and the contents > smashed or carried off. The library....was forced open and ransacked.....the > Tsaritsa's salon, like all other rooms, was thrown into chaos. The colossal > crystal lustre, with its artfully concealed music, was smashed to atoms. > Desks, pictures, ornaments--everything was destroyed. For a brief period following the revolution, the private apartments were open to the public to display the life of the former rulers, as this was the area of the palace where entry had been gained by the revolutionaries, and as a consequence, much had been destroyed so it is hard to know how accurate the depiction of the imperial private lives could have been. Today, with the exception of the library, the rooms are simply decorated and display part of the Hermitage Museum's vast collection of art; no reference is made to their former use. Much of the art collection displayed in the palace today is not original to the Winter Palace, but has been brought from numerous other palaces and estates which were nationalised after the revolution.

Its function is to provide a comprehensive set of visual helps to the driver, about block signaling, speed limits and temporary limitations. It's usually part of the more complex SCMT system. SSC get its information via a microwave transponder, called Punto Informativo (PI). Above lines equipped with the proper set of transmitters, it can show a complete replication of any kind of light signal, block maximum speed rating and special conditions straight into the drivers desk, improving safety in low visibility condition and helping drivers to notice anomalies. The system is rated for speeds up to 150 km/h, thus making it useful on most of the Italian network. It can be used on single and double track lines, effectively working on both directions if needed. It's designed to work along with SCMT, but it can be used independently. About five thousand kilometers of the Italian network are equipped with SSC but not with SCMT. SSC's job is purely informational, relying on driver's intervention in case of obstacles ahead, while SCMT can actively engage emergency brakes and speed limits. The system is made by a ground device (SST, Sotto Sistema di Terra, or Ground Subsystem) transmitting microwave inputs according to the given signal condition, and an onboard computer receiving and processing the signals (SSB, Sotto Sistema di Bordo, or Onboard Subsystem).

Early life Mosca was born, raised and attended Bloom High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois. He worked for his parents, Provino and Lisa Mosca, at their local restaurant, which was also named Mosca's. Mosca enlisted in the United States Army during World War II and served in the European Theater as an infantryman. He was wounded in action by shrapnel during battle in Italy. Mosca was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star for his service. He was transferred to the British military forces, who assigned him as a waiter for officers and visiting dignitaries due to his restaurant experience prior to the war. He served British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and future Yugoslavian President Josip Broz Tito in 1944, when they ate together at the Villa Rivalta in Naples, Italy. Mosca's parents and brother, Nick, moved to New Orleans during World War II because their daughter, Mary Mosca, had married a New Orleans resident named Vincent Marconi. John Mosca also moved to New Orleans following the end of the war and his honorable discharge from the United States Army. Restaurant In 1946, Mosca and his parents opened a new restaurant, called Mosca's, in a Waggaman, Louisiana, building that was once a tavern. Mosca decided to offer a menu similar to his parents' former restaurant in Illinois, specializing in family- style platters. However, they decided to include local Louisiana ingredients and cuisine, including seafood, such as oysters and crabs. Among the newer entrees added by Mosca were marinated crab salad, barbecued shrimp and baked oysters. The menu has remained virtually unchanged since the restaurant's founding, as of 2011. Mosca's was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, but rebuilt and reopened just ten months later. Mosca would wake up at 5 a.m. to shop for ingredients and make the pasta and sausage by hand. He worked at Mosca's consistently until approximately a month before his death in 2011. John Mosca died from prostate cancer at his home in Harahan, Louisiana, on July 13, 2011, at the age 86. He was survived by his wife, Mary Jo Angellotti Mosca, and daughter, Lisa Mosca. His wife and daughter still run Mosca's.

It was established in 1984 in Tha Song Yang District, Tak Province in the Dawna Range area and houses 50,000 Karen refugees;TBBC, Camps - Populations the number continues to rise as of June 2019. Mae La is the largest refugee camp for Karen refugees in Thailand. Over 90% are the persecuted ethnic Karen.UNHCR Thailand and Japan‚Äôs Pilot Resettlement Program 25 August 2010 The camps are overseen and run by the Thailand Burma Border Consortium (TBBC), a union of 11 international non-governmental organizations that provide food, shelter and non food items to the Burmese refugees and displaced people. The first refugees arrived in 1984, mostly of the Karen or Karenni ethnicities, fleeing armed conflict and ethnic persecution by the Burmese government. Thousands of villages, especially in the Karen and Karenni States, were razed and burned during the conflict. Many refugees cited similar stories: direct military attacks by the Myanmar army, forced labor, destruction of homes and food crops, and enslavement. The camp was originally established following the fall of the Karen National Union (KNU) base at the Thai village of Mae La on the border, and had a population of 1,100 people. Until 1995, refugees on the Thailand-Burma border lived in village-type settlements and were allowed to travel outside the camps to get food and shelter materials. However, due to attacks by the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), it was moved to the site where Zone C currently lies. After the fall of Manerplaw in January 1995, a number of camps were attacked in cross- border raids and the Thai authorities began to consolidate camps to improve security; Mae La was designated as the main consolidation camp in the area. In April 1995, Mae La increased in size from 6,969 to 13,195 due to the closure of five camps to the north ‚Äì Mae Ta Waw, Mae Salit, Mae Plu So, Kler Kho and Kamaw Lay Kho ‚Äì and the move of Huay Heng later in October of the same year. Over the following year, the camp doubled in size again to 26,629 as those lost in the move came back into the camp. In March 1997, some people were relocated here following the closure of Huai Bone camp (aka Don Pa Kiang) and again in February 1998 when Shoklo camp was closed. The camp was attacked in 1997 by DKBA troops with support from Burma Army units. There have been no incursions since then, but a mortar shell landed in Section A5 in March 1998. During the dry season, this area is quite tense with concerns relating to camp security, with threats of armed attack and/or attempts to burn the camp. The area of Karen State lying opposite Mae La camp is mostly rural, with no large settlements or infrastructure. The Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) maintains its 7th Brigade Headquarters nearby, and there are several Burma Army and Democratic Karen Buddhist Army outposts in the area (the DKBA is a faction of the KNLA which split off and aligned itself with the Burma Army in 1994). Mae La is considered an educational centre for refugees, so the current population includes several thousand students who come to study in the camp (some from other camps but mostly from Burma). They are registered only as temporary inhabitants. In total, as of July 2014 there were 2,763 students boarding in the camps. However, there are only a handful of schools on the Thailand-Burma border where students can apply once they finish a post-ten level school, leaving thousands of aspiring university students unable to complete further education. Thai authorities allowed refugees to register with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) periodically during 2004 and 2005, and since 2005, all registered refugees have been eligible for resettlement to third countries. In June 2014, 96,206 had been resettled, with the vast majority (75%) of them headed to the United States, followed by Australia, Canada, Finland, and Norway. Resettlement numbers have declined each year since 2008, mainly because the majority of those who were able to register in 2004 and 2005 have already left. The group settlement program to the United States has now closed, but a significant number of those eligible for resettlement remained and were expected to depart in 2015. Documentary Capital of Mae La is a documentary film about the Mae La refugee camp, the largest refugee camp of the nine along the Thai-Myanmar border. It was produced by Jiraporn Laocharoenwong of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Chulalongkorn University and Nuankhanit Phromchanya, the film's director. The film premiered in Amsterdam before being shown at the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre.

Niranjanananda was one of those few disciples, whom Ramakrishna termed as \\"Nityasiddhas\\" or \\"Ishwarakotis\\" ‚Äì that is, souls who are ever perfect.Swami Niranjanananda, RMIC [Niranjanananda is termed Senior since there was another swami, Niranjanananda (Junior) also known as Pandalai Maharaj, later in the Ramakrishna Mission who died in 1972].Swami Nrmalananda, a Unique Disciple of Sri Ramakrishna Even though his tenure with the newly formed Ramakrishna Mission was short lived owing to his early death, he left an indelible mark in spiritual and philanthropic activities. He had a majestic appearance, being tall with broad shoulders and strong physique. Biography Early life Niranjanananda was born as Nityaniranjan Ghosh and he was called by the short name of Niranjan. Little is known about his early life except that he came from a village called Rajarhat-Bishnupur in 24 Paraganas of Bengal province. He lived in Calcutta with his maternal uncle Kalikrishna Mitra. In his boyhood he became associated with a group of spiritualists and was considered as a successful medium.The Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashram, Mayawati, 1943. He was very frank and open minded, a trait which was appreciated by Ramakrishna. He had an abhorrence for married life and a relatively short temper, even though he was tender in nature. He later took up job with an indigo planter in the district of Murshidabad. Influence of Sri Ramakrishna Group photo taken on 30 January 1887 in Baranagar Math, Kolkata. Standing: (l‚Äìr) ) Shivananda, Ramakrishnananda, Vivekananda, Randhuni, Debendranath Majumdar, Mahendranath Gupta (Shri M), Trigunatitananda, H. Mustafi Sitting: (l‚Äìr) Niranjanananda, Saradananda, Hutko Gopal, Abhedananda Niranjan was about eighteen years old when he met Ramakrishna for the first time. When he came to know of his leanings towards spiritualism, Ramakrishna apparently chided him saying that, \\"if you think of ghosts and spooks, ghosts and spooks you will become, if you think of God, divine will be your life.\\" He later told Niranjan when he visited him for the second time, \\"My boy, days are passing, when will you realise God?\\". Niranjan was very impressed and he continued his association with Ramakrishna. Once when Niranjan was travelling by a boat to Dakshineswar, some of his fellow passengers began to speak ill about his master. At this, Niranjan got angry and threatened to drown the entire boat. When Ramakrishna heard about the incident he disapproved by saying that, \\"Anger is a deadly sin, why should you be subject, to it? Foolish people in their pitiable ignorance say many things. One should completely ignore them as beneath notice\\". Ramakrishna also disapproved of Niranjan working in an office, but he consented when he heard that Niranjan took up the job to maintain his aged mother.\\"God Lived with Them\\", by Chetanananda, published by Advaita Ashrama, 1997, page 243 When the master was ill and was kept in Shyampukur by his devotees, Niranajn quit his job to work as the gatekeeper of the house. There he was fooled by actress Binodini Dasi who visited an ailing Ramakrishna in the disguise of a European gentleman. Later when Ramakrishna was shifted to Cossipore garden house he continued with his role as a gatekeeper with utmost devotion and prevented at least two lay disciples of Ramakrishna from entering the premises when the master was critically ill, among them Ramachandra Dutta and Atul Ghosh, the brother of Girish Chandra Ghosh. After the death of Ramakrishna, there was a dispute among his disciples with the ownership of the relics which was mitigated with the help of Narendra (later Vivekananda). Niranjan, together with Shashi Maharaj (later Ramakrishnananda) preserved most of the relics in a separate urn and this they kept in the house of Balaram Bose, which was later removed to Belur Math. Monastic life Niranjan took his monastic vow along with other brother disciples in 1887 and came to stay permanently in the Baranagar Math, the first abode of the monks of the Ramakrishna order. He was given the monastic name of Swami Niranjanananda (Niranjan ‚Äì the blameless or the guileless one, and ananda ‚Äì bliss), by Vivekananda. In the monastery he did most of the laborious tasks, being physically stronger. He travelled to Puri and returned in April 1887. He made an altar for the Master in the old monastery house and also planted a Bel Tree on the same spot where Ramakrishna was cremated in Cossipore and created an altar around the tree. He went for a pilgrimage in November 1889 to Deoghar and stayed in Banshi Dutt's garden house living on alms. He went to Prayag (Allahabad), travelled through various parts of India and went to Colombo in Sri Lanka. For sometime he lived there as a preaching missionary teaching the ideals of his Master. In 1895 he returned to the Alambazar monastery before the birthday of Ramakrishna. When Vivekananda returned to India, Niranjanananda went to Colombo to receive him in 1897. He travelled with Swami Vivekananda all over Northern and Southern India. In 1898 he went to Almora and there he initiated Shuddhananda (Sudhir Maharaj). He then went to Varanasi and lived on alms. He inspired a group of youth to follow the path of service and renunciation, who later organised the home of service. He later went to Kankhal near Haridwar and became ill and came back to Calcutta for treatment. Upon recovery he went back to Varanasi, met Vivekananda there. During Vivekananda's illness he arranged for Ayurvedic treatment and during the latter's last days he was his gatekeeper, preventing people from crowding and disturbing an ailing Vivekananda in his room. After Vivekananda's death he returned to Haridwar. During his last days he suffered from chronic dysentery. He died 9 May 1904. With Holy Mother Niranjanananda, like his brother disciples held the Sarada Devi in very high esteem, calling her the holy mother. He took Girish Chandra Ghosh to the holy mother in her native village of Jairambati when the latter was going through a period of depression. Before his death he came to meet her and insisted that she did everything for him, including preparing food for him and feeding him. Character and legacy According to Ramakrishna, Niranjan was an ever pure soul and it was easy for him to realise god because he was guileless. According to the memoirs of his associate Achalananda (Kedar Maharaj) and the accounts of other brother disciples, Niranjan was marked for his simplicity, truthfulness, purity, fearlessness, steadiness (in any matter of principle) and renunciation. He once saved Sarada (Trigunatitananda), a brother disciple from drowning. He earnestly took up philanthropic and charitable work at the behest of Vivekananda and later formed the Sevashrama or the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service at Varanasi, by inspiring a group of young men to renounce the world and take up the service of the poor. Despite in need for fund he refused donation from a rich person when the latter went back on his promise. He nursed many of his brother disciples, including Yogananda whenever they were ill. He believed in Ramakrishna as the infinite god in human form, did not put much stress on rituals, and had tremendous faith in the doctrine of service.

Founded in 1898, Auburn Bearing is one of the oldest continuously operating thrust ball bearing manufacturers in the United States. Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing is most known for its line of thrust bearings that incorporate a \\"V\\" groove raceway, historically known as the \\"Auburn Groove,\\" which is specifically designed to reduce rolling friction by containing the ball bearings with four points of contact.  History  In 1860, Mark Dean Knowlton founded a Chicago-based paper box manufacturing business. The business, operating under the name M.D. Knowlton & Company, prospered throughout the decade until it eventually became a victim of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. With Mr. Knowlton's courage and determination, he was able to rebuild his business and resume his paper box manufacturing operation within the same year. In March, 1892, he sold his interest in the paper box manufacturing portion of his business in order to concentrate on inventing production machinery for the paper box manufacturing industry. In 1888, Mr. Knowlton moved his machinery business to Rochester, New York, where he then formed a partnership with Fred H. Beach, and the two business men began operating under the new business name Knowlton & Beach. In 1893, Knowlton & Beach introduced a near frictionless ball bearing to the market, presumably the first such bearing of its time, and in 1900, the company's bearing business was incorporated as the Rochester Ball Bearing Company and became a division of Knowlton & Beach. A year later in 1901, Knowlton & Beach further expanded their bearing business with the acquisition of the Auburn Ball Bearing Company, a manufacturer of ball and roller thrust bearings established in 1898 in Auburn, New York. Auburn Ball Bearing became the second division of Knowlton & Beach and was relocated to Rochester, New York to continue its operations. Auburn Ball Bearing's primary product, their Auburn Four-Point-Cone-Contact Ball Thrust Bearings, incorporates an exclusive \\"V\\" groove raceway, designed to distribute the load evenly over the balls as they travel on four points of contact, creating a straight line rolling effect and decreasing the amount of friction created by a full contact round groove design. Auburn Ball Bearing Company manufactured various sizes and configurations of their \\"V\\" groove thrust bearings for applications in industries including paper box manufacturing, railroad jacks, U.S. submarines, and U.S. Government Light Houses. Early company documentation illustrates Auburn Ball Bearings were used to support revolving lenses in the Carysfort Reef Light, Jupiter Inlet Light, and the St. Simons Island Light in the early twentieth century. Ball bearing in a v-groove raceway showing four points of contact. In 1904, Fred Beach retired and withdrew his interest in the Knowlton & Beach co-partnership. Mr. Knowlton subsequently took over the entire interest of the company, and later that year, he incorporated the company in New York under the name M.D. Knowlton Company. Mr. Knowlton served as president of the M.D. Knowlton Co. and the Auburn Ball Bearing Co. until his death in 1906. Knowlton was succeeded by his son, Colonel Frederick K. Knowlton, who served as president of the company until his death in 1939. During his time as president, the Auburn Ball Bearing Division of M.D. Knowlton Company was able to patent a number of new and useful improvements in the design of bearings, particularly in the design of ball thrust bearings, under inventor Francis A. Collins, Jr. *Ball Bearing Patent US1219919A ‚Äî Triple-race ball bearing which is self-contained, readily positioned, and high efficient in its operations (patented March 20, 1917). * Ball Bearing Patent US1219920A ‚Äî Double thrust ball bearing which is self-contained, and, therefore, capable of being handled and positioned as a unit (patented March 20, 1917). * Ball Bearing Patent US1219921A ‚Äî Double thrust ball bearing which is capable, when installed, of slight radial movements to accommodate itself to the radial position of the shaft, due to wear of the bearings, but is also capable of accommodating itself to angular changes in the position of the shaft, while providing a means for holding the parts of the bearing together to form a unit of the same so that it may be readily handled and positioned (patented March 20, 1917). The business continued through the war years and post-war period under family direction. In 1969 and 1970, M.D. Knowlton Company moved operations to Victor, New York, where the Knowlton Building then served as the company's headquarters.  The Company Today  On August 18, 2006, Fairport Products, a designer and manufacturer of power transmission parts, acquired the Auburn Ball Bearing Division of M.D. Knowlton Company, and its operations were then moved to the small town of Macedon, New York. The businesses continued to operate as two separate business entities until June 10, 2013, when the two companies became one under the new name Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing. Under the leadership of the current owner and manager, Peter Schroth, Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing continues to manufacture the original Auburn Groove Thrust Bearing which features a unique V-groove raceway designed with four contact points to reduce rolling friction. Auburn Bearing that feature this proprietary bearing design have the advantage of carrying larger radial loads than the typical round groove thrust bearing design. The company also manufacture round groove industry standard bearings. Auburn Bearing & Manufacturing specializes in custom, obsolete, and hard-to-find bearings in low- to mid- production volume. Furthermore, the company is increasing their capabilities in manufacturing custom radial bearings. Their products are distributed by a large network of industrial distributors including Motion Industries, Kaman Industrial Technologies, Applied Industrial Technologies and BDI.

He has contributed his talents to over forty Gold and Platinum albums, and over thirty Top 40 singles. His work has also been associated with twenty-one Grammy Award nominations. Background Shenale was born in Canada in 1951. His family relocated to the United States in the late-1950s. His earliest memories of music consist of hearing his father, an avid lover of classical music, play the violin, cello and mandolin in their home during his childhood. After attending a Latin High Mass at the age of five, he recalls being drawn to the piano in an attempt to recreate the music he had heard during the ceremony. The experience awakened his passion for the art and he soon found himself improvising his own music. It wasn't until the age of twelve, however, that he began formal piano lessons. Shenale began serious composition while in high school, drawing inspiration from classical composers such as Ravel, Granados, Britten and Stravinsky. He soon discovered modern-day musicians such as The Yardbirds, Jimi Hendrix and The Beatles which ignited his passion for rock and roll, leading him to form his first band. During his undergraduate studies, he first majored in physics and then music before dropping out in favor of playing and travelling with a hard rock club band. Although he considers himself \\"a performance rock 'n' roll musician based in classical music,\\" Shenale acknowledges that technology is a major aspect that runs throughout the majority of his work and is equally at home with both acoustic and electronic instruments and processes. Early work Shenale's early work began in film, a medium he would subsequently revisit throughout his career, with 1971's The Young Graduates. Continuing throughout the 1970s he recorded and performed live with artists such as Gregory Hines, Redbone, Jon Lucien, Bobby Womack and Severance. However, he considers his collaborations, specifically during the latter part of the decade, with artists such as Jim Keltner and The Beach Boys to be of particular value and significance, affording him a considerable amount of time in-studio where he was given the opportunity to work with state-of-the-art equipment and to learn the language and various philosophies behind recording professionally. Shenale's instruments of choice during this time included the Hammond, Fender Rhodes, Clavinet, Orchestron, Mellotron and Leslie Cabinet, along with various other synthesizers. Career in popular music Shenale's work has been featured on albums by artists such as Tori Amos, Willy DeVille, Jane's Addiction, Tracy Chapman, Billy Idol, Janet Jackson, Diana Ross, The Bangles, Dionne Warwick, Rick Springfield, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray and John Hiatt. Career in film, theater, and other works Shenale's work has also been featured on films and musicals by director's such as Curtis Hanson, John Hughes, Carl Reiner, Herbert Ross, Walter Hill, Richard Lester, Brian Yuzna, Steve Miner, Paul Verhoeven, Frank Oz, Marianne Elliott.
