Throughout his music career, Harris worked closely with Michael Lloyd on projects outside the WCPAEB including the Rogues, California Spectrum, and Brigadune. In 1973, he recorded a self-titled solo album on Capitol Records. Biography Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Harris is the eldest son of symphonic composer Roy Harris. In 1962, the family moved to Los Angeles, where a year later Shaun Harris, along with his younger brother Danny, began performing in the Kim Fowley-produced surf rock band the Snowmen. In 1964, the group released the \\"Ski Storm\\" single on Challenge Records. While attending the Hollywood Professional School, the Harris brothers befriended Michael Lloyd, the leader of the rival band the Rouges. Shortly afterwards, Shaun Harris assumed the role of bass guitarist with the Rouges, and recorded the single \\"Wanted: Dead or Alive\\" for Fowley's own Living Legend record label in 1965. Another project, known as the Laughing Wind, recorded the single, \\"Good to Be Around\\" in the same year. With Roy Harris's financial backing, the Harris brothers and Lloyd recorded demos, which would later appear on the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's debut album Volume One in 1966. Released on the small FiFo label, Volume One was made possible thanks to Bob Markley, a former scholar of law attempting to gain fame on the Sunset Strip with the group under his command. Shaun Harris is the only band member, other than Markley, to appear on every album recorded by the WCPAEB, including the final effort credited to \\"Markley A Group\\" in 1970. Between 1967 and 1968, while the group was on hiatus, Harris and Lloyd formed the side-project, California Spectrum, which performed live and released two singles \\"Sassafras\\" and \\"She May Call You Up Tonight\\" in early 1968. Following the distribution of Markley A Group, the WCPAEB disbanded. A year after the band's demise, Harris recorded the solo single \\"I'll Cry Out from My Grave (God I'm Sorry)\\", a rare sunshine pop record produced by Lloyd and released under the alias Brigadune. In 1973, Harris signed with Capitol Records issuing a self-titled album which boasted a country rock sound unheard of in any of his earlier work. Recorded with top session musicians from the Wrecking Crew, Beach Boy Bruce Johnston, and Lloyd, Shaun Harris was nonetheless hindered by sharing the same release date as Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. In the 1990s, the album acquired a cult following, particular among WCPAEB fans, and was reissued on Rev-Ola Records in 2005 with the mono version of \\"I'll Cry Out from My Grave (God I'm Sorry)\\". Music critic Jason Ankeny described Shaun Harris as mainstream pop far departing from Harris's stint with the WCPAEB, but also noted its \\"melodies and arrangements are atypically complex and its lyrics are profoundly introspective, exploring themes of melancholy, self-doubt, and even suicide with uncommon candor\\". The poor sales of the album prompted Capitol Records to cut Harris from their roster. He reunited with Lloyd and his brother for smaller projects including Grand Concourse and Rockit, and also served as president of Barry Manilow's publishing company before retiring from music in 2004. Harris has since been living in Oregon to write a play about his life.

The episode was written by Ben Sokolowski and Keto Shimizu and directed by Gordon Verheul. It was first broadcast on February 10, 2016 in The CW. The episode revolves about Nyssa offering an elixir named Lotus to Oliver that can reverse the effects of the Lazarus Pit and offers him to heal Thea, in exchange for him killing Malcolm. They convince him to meet with Nyssa to give her the command of the League of Assassins but Malcolm will not give it too easy. Meanwhile, Felicity meets with her father, the Calculator, and listens to why he left, questioning if he is a bad man. The episode received generally positive reviews. Plot On Lian Yu, Taiana is furious at Oliver for killing Vlad. When he shows her the rock with symbols, Taiana takes the stone and asks for Reiter to barter her escape, but Reiter takes the stone and keeps them imprisoned. He tells Taiana to kill Oliver, or she will die. They begin conspiring to escape by killing Reiter and his men. Reiter then tells Oliver that they will begin to dig underneath to find what he is looking for. Five years later, Nyssa tells Oliver she will give him the elixir if he kills Malcolm . Meanwhile, Felicity confronts Noah, her father, over his past, and he gives her a USB proving some of his crimes. The team is considering whether to kill Malcolm. They finally decide to meet with Malcolm to give the League's ring to Nyssa. Laurel meets with Nyssa to negotiate another way: Oliver can convince Malcolm to give his power to her in exchange for the elixir. Nyssa agrees but threatens to kill people if Malcolm refuses. Oliver asks for a sample of the elixir to prove the value. They put it on Thea and some of the scars heal themselves. Oliver, Diggle, Laurel and Malcolm meet with Nyssa to give her the ring. However, Malcolm snatches the ring and brings assassins to attack them. Nyssa and her fighters escape and Malcolm is stopped by Oliver. The team decides to intercept and neutralize Nyssa and her group. Meanwhile, Felicity takes her father to the labs of Palmer Tech but she is sending him into a \\"trap\\". Oliver confronts Malcolm for not following Nyssa's conditions, and Malcolm responds by denying Nyssa his power and also reveals that he knows Oliver has a son. In order to bring peace, Oliver arranges a sword fight between Nyssa and Malcolm. However, before the fight, Oliver uses ancient rules to switch Nyssa's place for him, as he is still her husband. Oliver swiftly defeats Malcolm and, instead of killing him, cuts his hand with the League's ring, knocks him out and gives it to Nyssa. He is finally given the elixir and Nyssa becomes the new Ra's al Ghul. He gives the elixir to Thea and she is healed. Noah meets with Felicity. She confronts him for having abandoned her, and he admits that the police are looking for her and Lance. Then the police arrive and arrest him. Seeing the new role and darkness on her, Nyssa brings Malcolm, Oliver and Laurel over, takes her ring and throws him on the fire, disbanding the League of Assassins. Malcolm is furious about Oliver's betrayal and threatens to make him suffer. At night, Malcolm meets with Darhk to tell him the person Oliver loves the most: William, his son. Production In January 2016, it was revealed that the 13th episode for the fourth season would be titled \\"Sins of the Father\\" and was to be directed by Gordon Verheul and written by Ben Sokolowski & Keto Shimizu. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 2.44 million viewers with a 0.9/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 2% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was seen by 2.48 million viewers and a 0.9/3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.9 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. =Critical reviews= \\"Sins of the Father\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode an \\"okay\\" 6.7 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"This week's Arrow was disappointingly uneven despite the strong thematic story ties and the idea that multiple characters were grappling with change and redemption. Only one of the several action scenes stood out, and the rooftop duel was disappointingly brief and unsatisfying. Luckily, the resolution of this conflict and the major twist that resulted spell good things for the show in the weeks ahead.\\" The A.V. Club's Alasdair Wilkins gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Sins Of The Father' is a solid enough episode, though I'll admit it feels like it's missing something. I suspect some of that goes back to the problem that hung over so much of the third season, as Arrow struggled to make all the business with Ra's al Ghul compelling. Nearly a year later, my best explanation for the relative failure of that season is that the show never really got across why the League story mattered. \\" Andy Behbakht of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"Overall, despite some mixed feelings about it, 'Sins of the Father' was a solid episode in many ways as the intensity worked better once the whole episode had played out and it did set up more things to look forward to. Malcolm became a bit more relevant again, even though he lost the title, the league as well as a hand (want to bet how many episodes it will take before he get some sort of cybernatic hand?), but at least now he has a bigger role to play again. The one thing that still remains irrelevant is those darn flashbacks.\\" Jonathon Dornbush of EW stated: \\"When life offers a choice, do you simply accept the options presented to you, or do you, as Oliver attempts to throughout 'Sins of the Father,' discover an alternative that might actually be the best choice to make? On Arrow this week, nearly every major decision either implicitly or explicitly involved fathers. From Malcolm Merlyn to Felicity's returning father to Nyssa's dead dad to Oliver himself, fatherhood looms large over the characters' choices in this episode (which, if the utterance of that word approximately 72 times within the first 15 minutes didn't tip you off, was most certainly the theme of the week).\\" Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5.0, stating: \\"There were certainly some surprises on Arrow Season 4 Episode 13, but unless we're being fooled, it seems as though we have been given a pretty good indication of where the remainder of the season is heading. We might know who is in the grave and who is responsible for putting them there.\\" Noel Kirkpatrick of TV.com wrote positive about the episode, stating \\"I think many of you, dear readers, are in agreement with me that Oliver has generally sucked at this sort of thing (i.e., the back of half of last season), and while he didn't suck too much less here, we at least got to see him grapple with the decision-making and what happened when his plans went awry. As a result, it was not only a nice departure from the usual Arrow routine, but it also didn't get bogged down in that whole 'I plotted this off- screen' nonsense that plagued Season 3's storyline. Essentially, while Oliver was still in charge, at least Diggle and Laurel were piping in with opinions, and Oliver was listening to them and weighing his options with their advice. I like it when the show treats Team Arrow as a team, what can I say.\\" References External links  2016 American television episodes Arrow (TV series) episodes Television episodes set on fictional islands ","title":"Sins of the Father (Arrow)"},{"id":"51306056","text":"Thomas Bessis is a French bridge player.

The aim of the offensive was to establish a new supply line into Aleppo city, after a previous Army offensive had cut-off all rebel access to Aleppo. The offensive =Initial rebel attack= On 31 July, the Army of Conquest launched a counter-offensive both south and north of Aleppo in an attempt to lift the siege on the rebel-held areas of the city. Fierce fighting was reported at the Al-Castillo Highway, while the rebels managed to capture the Al-Hikma school and two hills on the southern outskirts of Aleppo, which constituted an advanced Army defense line, after two rebel suicide car-bombers attacked government positions in the Rashidin neighborhood. The suicide bombings largely destroyed the former school. The wide-scale rebel offensive reportedly included 8,000‚Äì10,000 fighters, 95 tanks, hundreds of rocket launchers and a large number of suicide-bombers. By evening, the rebels also took control of Al-‚ÄòAmariyah village and reached the nearby 1070 Al- Hamadaniyah Housing Project where fighting continued. At this point, the Russian Air Force started to conduct heavy air-strikes in an attempt to push back the rebel offensive. During the night, the 1070 Al-Hamadaniyah Housing Project was also taken by the rebels. The fighting then shifted to the Al- Assad Military Academy. The next morning, government reinforcements arrived at the Al-Assad Military Academy, after which the Army started a counter-attack and reportedly managed to cut the road between the Al-Hikma school and the 1070 Housing Project, leaving the rebels besieged at the Housing area. An assault on the 1070 Housing Project then started. However, later in the day, the rebels once again advanced and took control of Mushrifah village (also known as Sharfa), that is situated on a hill that overlooks the Military Academy. Later that evening, a new Army counter-attack was launched, and the military managed to recapture the 1070 Housing Project neighborhood, one hill, and a factory. Elsewhere, the Army backed by intense Russian Air Force bombardment launched a large assault on the Handarat Camp. Some speculated that the potential government capture of the Handarat Camp would create a new supply route to west Aleppo‚Äôs neighborhoods. Meanwhile, Kurdish forces reportedly rejected an offer by some government soldiers for Kurdish fighters to leave the YPG-controlled part of Aleppo. =Army counter-offensive and rebel offensive on Ramouseh and artillery school= On 2 August, the Army continued with its push to regain ground and managed to retake several more positions in the vicinity of the 1070 Housing Project, as well as Al-‚ÄòAmariyah village and two more hills. Still, later in the day, the rebels launched an assault on the Ramouseh district, with two rebel tunnel bombs detonating under buildings that were used as barracks by government forces. Subsequently, rebels inside Aleppo made an advance into Ramouseh, attempting to flank the Military Academy. Further to the south, the rebels also took control of the village of Huwayz and a hill at Al-‚ÄòAmariyah. At the same time, on the western edge of Aleppo, the rebels seized the Minyan Sawmills area. However, this turned out to be a trap when the Army called in four precise Russian air- strikes on the complex, killing 38 rebels and forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the rebel assault on Ramouseh was slowed due to heavy Russian air- strikes, despite the rebels holding overlooking positions. The attack on Ramouseh was eventually repelled with minimal rebel gains, that were recaptured, and the Army managed to retake Huwayz and the surrounding hills. While the heavy fighting on the southwestern edge of Aleppo continued, government forces reportedly secured 30 percent of the Handarat Camp in the northeast of Aleppo during the day. In the course of the day's fighting, rebel forces suffered heavy casualties with several commanders killed. There were also pro-government claims that rebels had used chemical weapons during their attacks. The rebels were reportedly irritated by the lack of progress at the 1070 complex, Military Academy, Sawmill and Ramouseh and were preparing a fourth assault against government lines that would include more suicide car- bombers. By 3 August, the Army counter-attack had recaptured 5 out of 8 positions that were lost since the start of the rebel offensive, including the two villages and two hilltops. The rebels were still in control of one village and four hilltops. By this point, rebel commanders reportedly decided to abandon their pre-planned six-stage offensive to review future military maneuvers in the region, with plans being made for the next attack wave. On 4 August, the fourth rebel assault was launched, targeting Ramouseh and Al-‚ÄòAmariyah. The rebels once again seized Al-‚ÄòAmariyah and its nearby hill, or at least a part of it. Meanwhile, the Army was still trying to fully recapture the 1070 Housing Project and retake the Al-Hikma school with the support of Russian air-strikes. On 5 August, the Army recaptured all of the points they lost the previous day, including Al-‚ÄòAmariyah. Later, a rebel attack on the Military Academy started, with two suicide car-bombers attacking government positions. The suicide bombings, combined with heavy artillery fire, caused confusion among government forces, creating an opportunity for the rebels to enter the base and capture a part of it. However, heavy air- strikes managed to provide the Army enough time to regroup, push the rebels out of the base and repel the attack. Still, a breach on the southern end of the Military Academy still existed. Meanwhile, government troops managed to take the Steel Factory after clashes with rebels at the Handarat Camp. =Rebel assault on artillery base, breaking the siege= On 6 August, after a new attack, the rebels took control of the Armament school and most of the Artillery school, and thus more than half of the Military Academy. The Artillery school had been used as an artillery base. Fighting continued at the Air Technical school, with the rebels eventually being repelled. Shortly after their advances at the Military Academy, rebels both inside and outside Aleppo advanced into the Ramouseh neighborhood, linked up and captured it. With this advance, the rebels managed to cut the government's supply line into the government-held part of west Aleppo and announced the Army's siege of rebel- held east Aleppo had been broken. However, the new rebel supply line was still under Army artillery fire and being hit by air-strikes, making both sides essentially under siege. Since the rebel offensive started, at least 130 civilians had been killed, most by rebel shelling of government-held districts. 500 fighters on both sides also died, mostly rebels. At the end of the day, the rebels were in control of the entire Military Academy base, after taking the Air Technical school, and the Ramouseh district, while the Army still held the Cement Factory and parts of the military housing.Factions incur regime, the Russians, the Iranians and the Lebanese Hezbollah the biggest spiritual and military loss since 2013 The rebels captured a number of armored vehicles and an undisclosed amount of ammunition during the capture of the military academy, as shown on footage on the next day.

Hailing from an artistic family in north Rajasthan, Khetanchi studied fine art in Jaipur and worked for some time as an assistant art director in Bollywood and an illustrator for magazines, before returning to Rajasthan to focus on painting. Khetanchi is known for painting petite female figures, Rajput women, Rajasthani village women and forts, as well as adapting classical European paintings to Indian versions. Another form associated with him is calendar kitsch. Distinguishing features of his style are uniqueness, delicacy and swiftness of drawing. Though he is recognized as a realist painter and self-identifies as such, his works span from Romanticism to deep Realism and are held in various private and corporate collections in India and abroad. His paintings have been displayed at solo and group exhibitions at Jaipur, New Delhi, Mumbai, Singapore, Dubai and London. Life Khetanchi was born in north Rajasthan on 2 February 1958. He hails from Sardarshahar town in Churu district. His father Khetaram was a painter who worked as an art teacher in a government school in Sardarshahar. Khetanchi grew up in Rajasthan in an environment conducive to art and ventured into painting at the age of 15, starting with portraits and then moving to paintings. He was inspired by the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Ingres. Khetanchi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Drawing and Painting from University of Rajasthan in Jaipur. He developed his painting skills in Mumbai, working on film sets and sketching passers-by at the Juhu beach. While in Mumbai, he worked as an assistant art director with Manzoor ul Haq on several Bollywood films like Muqaddar Ka Sikandar (1978), Abdullah (1980), Jwalamukhi (1980) and Kaalia (1981). Khetanchi says he did not like the environment of Bollywood and decided to channelise his creativity into painting only. He returned to Rajasthan and started with painting forts and culture of the state. Over the years, he captured the culture, traditions, rural beauty, crafts and textiles of Rajasthan. As per Khetanchi, he received limelight and recognition starting from 2003, when his work was exhibited in both New Delhi and Jaipur. Khetanchi lives in Jaipur, where he works from his studio. Work Gopal Swami Khetanchi with a painting of the Jaisalmer Fort Khetanchi works with oil on canvas, and has been doing so since 1971. He has not experimented with acrylics as he feels that he has better control on colour values with oil colours. He usually takes a month's time to complete a work and works in four layers. Khetanchi's work saw several phases and styles like Realism, Surrealism and Abstraction, before ending in a combination of traditional and modern art. In 2006, the style in his exhibition Shringar combined fine linework of Rajasthani miniature paintings with the prettiness of Victorian kitsch. By 2011, he had moved from pure figuration to conceptual renderings and started experimenting with different palettes and imaging styles. Erik Maell writes of Khentanchi: As per critic P B Chandra, Khetanchi is perhaps the only artist after Ram Gopal Vijayvargiya to specialize in painting women in various moods and beauty. Chandra believes that Khetanchi's depiction of women is inspired by the style of Raja Ravi Varma, although Khetanchi says that he has not tried to imitate any past painters or copy any contemporaries and that his style of work is different. Chandra wrote in 2003 that Khetanchi's works were regional in emphasis with a heavy dose of romanticism. Khetanchi is known for giving a unique Indian or Rajasthani touch to his works, especially to the robes and background. His recreation of Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus has a pearl-clad Rajasthani woman coming out of a lotus in place of a shell. When Indianising European paintings, Khetanchi adapts the figures to Indian concepts of beauty and does not paint figures completely nude to avoid any controversies. As per art critic Prayag Shukla, Khetanchi's recreations of sorts of European paintings have both a Western and an Eastern context. =Reinterpretations of Mona Lisa= Khetanchi has reinterpreted the Mona Lisa in two oil-on-canvasses painted in 2006: Devashree (24 by 36 inches) and Bani-Thani (20 by 30 inches), of which the latter is a combination of the Mona Lisa and the eponymous painting Bani Thani by Nihal Chand. Bani-Thani was used in the promotion for Le Festival des √âcrivains du monde: √âcrivains de l‚ÄôInde held in Paris in 2014 and on the cover of the November‚ÄìDecember 2014 edition of Nouvelles De L'Inde, the bimonthly publication of the Indian embassy in Paris. =Gandhigiri= Through his Gandhigiri canvasses (2010), Khetanchi depicted Mahatma Gandhi's dream of an independent India free from poverty and hardships by juxtaposing Gandhi's face with that of common people. Art curator Archana Bahl Sapra said that the exhibition showed the \\"contrasting picture of shining India and whining Bharat\\". Some paintings showed Gandhi almost lost, as he sees an India which is modern, fast-moving, tech-savvy, busy and Bollywood-obsessed with consumerism at its peak, while others showed him seeing people struggling in poverty due to corruption and government policies. =Monuments= Monuments is one of the favourite themes of Khetanchi. He has painted the Jal Mahal and Hawa Mahal in his own distinct style. In addition, he has painted many forts including three forts of Jaipur (Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh Fort and Amber Fort), Jaisalmer's Sonar Killa, Chittorgarh's Vijay Stambha, Udaipur's City Palace, Jodhpur's Mehrangarh Fort, Bundi's Taragarh Fort, Bikaner's Junagarh Fort, Kuchaman Fort and Kumbhalgarh Fort. His exhibition titled Rajputana (2012) displayed eleven paintings of various forts in Rajasthan. Views Khetanchi, known for his love for Rajasthan, says of the state: From 2008 to 2010, Khetanchi researched the message and teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and their contemporary relevance. Khetanchi sees Mahatma Gandhi as a motivational force in his life. He is passionate about Gandhi's vision and says: Khetanchi believes that while art may not offer solutions to social problems, it helps bring them into focus. He feels that foreign tourists looking for Rajasthani art should be given correct direction with in-house guidance, and they should not be cheated by being sold cheap art at huge prices. He sees himself as a realist, or a sincere friend of actual truth, and says he chose realistic art because it is nearer to human interest and at the same time it is very much challenging. Khetanchi believes that many heritage places in Rajasthan have been neglected and even guides, who do not know the true significance of the sites, are ignorant about local art forms like the Bundi school of art. Exhibitions Khetanchi does few exhibitions, about one a year. The reason, as per Khetanchi, is that his exhibitions are theme-based. =Solo exhibitions= * 1998: Hotel Park Royal, New Delhi. * 1998: Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur. * 2002: Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur. * 2003: Rabindra Bhawan, Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi. * 2003: Mahakaal at Surekh Gallery, Jawahar Kala Kendra, Jaipur.

She is best known as the lead vocalist and keyboardist of the now- defunct alternative rock band Bulletproof Stockings, which received media attention for performing at several major music venues for all-female audiences, in accordance with kol isha. In 2015, she was included in The Jewish Week's \\"36 Under 36\\", an annual list of influential Jews under age 36. She currently leads the band PERL. Early life Wolfe grew up in Chicago, Illinois in a Chabad family. Her parents are baalei teshuva; her father was a Jewish atheist and her mother was raised Catholic before they respectively. She studied classical piano from the age of six. Wolfe's parents, having not been raised Orthodox, exposed her to secular rock artists like The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, and The Rolling Stones. Her father, a jazz pianist, introduced her to Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Etta James. Growing up, she listened to classical music, oldies and classic rock radio, R&B; and hip hop, and alternative rock and punk bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers, No Doubt, and Green Day. She attended a religious high school, where she often got in trouble for \\"rebellious\\" behavior such as wearing heavy eye liner. She studied psychology at Northwestern University. Career =Bulletproof Stockings= In 2011, Wolfe was introduced through a mutual friend to drummer Dalia Shusterman, who had played for the band Hopewell before becoming religious. Bonding over music, they formed Bulletproof Stockings in December of that year. They released the EP Down to the Top in 2012 and subsequently added violinist Dana Pestun and cellist Elisheva Maister, the latter of whom Wolfe had known since 2009, to their lineup. Wolfe was also featured in the 2013 Canadian documentary Shekinah Rising. The band received considerable media attention for their uniqueness as an all-female Hasidic rock band, as well as a 2014 women-only concert at Arlene's Grocery that was filmed for the Oxygen miniseries Living Different. In April 2016, the band announced via Facebook that they were splitting up to pursue other projects, cancelling a planned debut album called Homeland Call Stomp. =PERL= In the summer of 2016, Wolfe announced a new band called PERL, featuring fellow Bulletproof Stockings members Dana Pestun and Elisheva Maister. They debuted with a July 14 concert on the roof of the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan. Wolfe said of the new material, \\"I‚Äôm finding more of my voice and I‚Äôm a lot more pulled back, and vulnerable. The songs have less drama, more honesty. It‚Äôs been really exciting working on new stuff. Since we‚Äôre starting with piano, violin, and cello, there‚Äôs a lot of room for layering and harmonizing. We‚Äôre also playing with loop pedals and drum machine, as well as working on incorporating other instruments like guitar, saxophone, and trumpet. We‚Äôre having a lot of fun with it.\\" In 2017, Wolfe performed an acoustic piano version of a new song, \\"Say It Again\\", as an exclusive for the website Hevria. The following year, PERL contributed the song \\"Piha Pascha\\" to the soundtrack of the documentary 93Queen. In 2020 they released three singles - \\"Say It Again\\", \\"It's A Party!\\", and \\"Everything Was Flowers\\" - followed by a full-length debut album, Late Bloomer.

He joined The Hill in August 2015 as part of their campaign team. Swan became a national political reporter for Axios in December 2016. While at Axios, Swan broke several stories about the Trump administration. Former Washington Post journalist Ronald Kessler claimed in his 2018 book The Trump White House: Changing the Rules of the Game that Swan is among a handful of reporters to whom President Donald Trump feeds information, with instructions to attribute quotes to an unnamed White House official. Swan was the first to report that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris climate deal; that Steve Bannon was about to be fired; that Trump would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital; and that Trump would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals executive action policy. Swan broke the news that the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was retiring from Congress. In August 2020, Swan was praised by people on social media for the manner in which he had conducted an interview with President Trump. During the interview, Swan pointedly questioned and fact-checked numerous false, misleading, or bizarre statements as the President spoke them. Media columnist for The New York Times Ben Smith wrote that Swan's was \\"perhaps the best interview of Mr. Trump‚Äôs term.\\". Videographer Kyle Kelley, who was filming the interview for Axios, later stated on the Factual America Podcast that despite Swan's critical questioning, Trump seemed to have respected Swan. Recognition For his reporting in the United States, as a member of the Sydney Morning Herald in the Canberra Press Gallery, Swan was presented with the Wallace Brown Award in 2014 for most outstanding young journalist.

Inglis-Flowerdale catchment area While not tributaries of the main river system, Sisters Creek and Seabrook Creek are notable minor creeks which form part of the Inglis-Flowerdale catchment area. Annual rainfall ranges from about at the coast to greater than in the upper reaches of the catchment, some inland from Wynyard. Forestry plantations dominate the landscape in the western region of the catchment, with intensive agriculture land-use in the north and eastern regions. Because of the steep and confining nature of the topography around the Inglis and Flowerdale rivers, both have retained substantial native forests that tend to buffer the rivers from both land-use activities.

This village is famously known for its massive fishing business, modern shipping dock, and traditional Indian homemade alcohol which is also known as Sara. It is also an eponym to Khar Road. It is one of the oldest settlements in Mumbai and the original inhabitants of Mumbai have been living here for centuries. Khar Danda is a popular location considered while shooting Bollywood movies. Several blockbuster movies have been shot here including Akshay Kumar's Special 26.  Danda Havli Khar Danda is also famous for an old tradition and festival named Varin Pada (\\"Havli\\") Holi, This is one of the first Hindu festival ever granted by the British -India government. The story begins when back in the olden days, the people of Khar Danda used to gather woods from Bandra for bushfire tradition. But once due to lack of funds and trees available in Khar-Bandra belt, the people started visiting neighbouring villages to gather wood which led to heated arguments and endless fights between locals, there is a tale that thereafter the goddess of Holi was impressed by the worship and faith shown by the village and appeared to a group of fishermen and stopped them from visiting other villages at the same time when the other villagers were out for wood hunt, she commanded that the whole village shall celebrate Holi 2 days before the actual date of Hindu Calendar so that there was sufficient wood for bushfire available to all the villages in the neighborhood. When the British officer Carter heard this tale, he was surprised and decided that to implement it in that village forever since 1921, Until then to now every here Holi is burnt 2 days before the actual date. Maharashtra Police are always the guest of honor present to celebrate along with the villagers. Reference History Bandra is known to be natural harbour since the ancient times, then called \\"Bandora\\". Khar Danda & Chimbai were the only suitable shores for habitation. Chimbai village was too small then and was frequently flooded during monsoons due to being in low lying area. The fishermen community hence preferred to settle in Khar Danda. During the Portugal Era, the Portuguese sailors along with the villagers built a beacon on a coral reef near Khar Danda, which is till date battling the sea tides and alerting the fishermen's and the sailors about the sea rocks presence in that area, previously named as \\"Uarashi Reef\\" and now renamed to \\"Varashi Reef\\". The Ministry of Home , Maharashtra government has its office of the regional port officer in Khar Danda. A few generation later as the community grew in this Koliwada, the local panchayat Danda Koli Samaj divided the village into small gaothans in order to ease the management. The gaothan were named Dandpada, Madhala pada, Kotpada, Patilpada, Varin Pada & Vetalpada with each gaothan having their own deity. Soon after the Bombay land reclamation progressed Hanuman Nagar & Gulab Nagar were added into the official map of Khar Danda. Khar Danda gaothans Khar Danda Map COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic In the year 2020, the world was impacted by a pandemic that started in Wuhan, China. This led to countries going into lockdown and cities going shut. With the help of BMC and Mumbai Police, Khar Danda sealed itself cutting out to others by barricading all entries and exit to the village. This protected the village from spreading of infection. Certain rules and norms have adhered and shops were allowed to open in a specific time bracket.

Constructed to defend the harbour of Hugh Town from possible French attack, the fortification incorporated Italianate-style bastions with protective orillons and would have been the most advanced design in the kingdom at the time. It was not completed, probably due to a shortage of funds and the passing of the invasion threat, and only the south-west side remains. In the 21st century, Harry's Walls are managed by English Heritage and open to visitors. History In the 16th century, the Isles of Scilly were ruled by the King of England. They were an important strategic location on the route between mainland Europe, Ireland and Scotland, but threatened by the forces of France and Spain. Under Henry VIII, a sequence of defensive works called the Device programme had been built to protect the English mainland from French attack, but although a garrison was established at Ennor Castle on the island of St Mary's, no actual construction work was carried out in the islands.; After Henry's death in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, assumed the throne, with the government controlled by Edward Seymour, the Duke of Somerset. His brother, Thomas, inspected Scilly, resulting in new investments in their defences, initially focused on the island of Tresco.; The Duke fell from power in 1549 and a fresh survey was conducted by Captain William Tyrrell; work then began on protecting the island of St Mary's. Diagram from the early 1550s depicting the intent for Harry's Walls, produced after the work had started In May 1551, John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth, was ordered to construct a fort on St Mary's, probably with the intent of guarding the entrance to the new harbour at Hugh Town.; ; His instructions stated that it was to be positioned \\"upon the little hill betwixt the freshe water and St. Marie Roode\\", and was accompanied by a promise that lead would be sent for the roofing that summer.; A document from the early 1550s noted that a brewhouse and a mill were ready to be sent to St Mary's from South Wales as part of the project, to be installed by the fresh water pond. The name \\"Harry's Walls\\" is the result of the defences being popularly, but incorrectly, attributed to Edward's father, Henry. Contemporary plans showed an intention to create a square fortification with four angular, \\"arrow-head\\" bastions with protective orillons, with living quarters arranged around a square courtyard for the garrison in the centre. It was intended to develop the Italianate ideas first introduced in Portsmouth and Yarmouth under Henry, and would have been what the historian Andrew Saunders considers to be \\"the most advanced piece of military engineering for its date to be seen in this country\\". In 1554, two light artillery guns called sakers were reported installed in the fort. During the reign of Mary I, an unsuccessful attempt was made to create a garrison of 150 men on the island in 1554, partially to provide manpower to complete the project, and in 1591 proposals were again put forward to complete the work. The defences were never completed; instead, new defences were constructed at Star Castle in 1593 and the remains of Harry's Walls were used in the 17th and 18th centuries for the dumping of rubbish.; ; Earlier analysis blamed the poor siting of Harry's Walls for the abandonment of the project. The antiquary William Borlase was critical of the fort during his 1752 visit, noting that it had been \\"begun injudiciously\\" in a poor location.; The writer John Troutbeck, who visited at the end of the 18th century, argued that if the fortification had been completed, \\"it would have been of little use, being placed too far within the head lands, and commanding none of the sounds to any effect. During the 20th century, criticism was levied about its position in relation to the anchorage, and about the size of the site, which was felt to be both too small for the proposed design and too difficult to defend.; ; Detail of the granite walling More recent research suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may have been designed to work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland.; Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable ¬£35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.; The south-west side of the fort, comprising two bastions and a connecting curtain wall made of granite blocks and rubble, is well-preserved.; The angular bastions and their orillons are across and high, while the curtain wall is long and high. The exterior blocks have been robbed in various places, exposing the rubble interior. An unfinished defensive ditch, long, wide and deep runs along the outside. A prehistoric standing stone, later used to help navigation at sea, is positioned just to the north of the fort, with a modern navigational aid positioned alongside it.; In the 21st century these remains are managed by English Heritage and open to the public. The remains are protected under UK law as an ancient monument.

[1997] IEHC 176, commonly known as the C Case, was a case on whether a thirteen-year-old girl (known as C) who had become pregnant as a result of rape and was suicidal could be permitted to travel to obtain an abortion. She was in the care of the Eastern Health Board (EHB), an organ of the Irish state, and the abortion was resisted by her parents, the plaintiffs in the case. abortion law in Ireland at the time of the case made abortion inaccessible within Ireland; however, in the X Case (1992), the Supreme Court had ruled that abortion was permissible under the Constitution where there was a threat to a woman's life, including a risk of suicide. Facts Ms C was brutally raped by an adult male (Simon McGinley) on 27 August 1997, and became pregnant as a result. She is a member of the travelling community and one of a family of twelve. The alleged rapist is also of the travelling community and a long-standing friend of the family. The evidence before the District Court indicated that she lived in particularly squalid conditions which were quite unlike the conditions in which most travelling people lived. The Court believed that the girl was very severely traumatised by the rape. The girl was currently in the care of the Irish state. She became suicidal and the EHB made a court application to bring her to the UK for an abortion. She had an abortion in the UK in December 1997, accompanied by two officers from the Garda S√≠och√°na and her EHB guardian. The parents were opposed to the abortion, and communicated regularly with Youth Defence. The rapist, Simon McGinley, was jailed for 12 years. Law Abortion was illegal in Ireland at the time of the case. It was prohibited under sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, and Article 40.3.3¬∞ of the Constitution of Ireland protected the right to life of the unborn. The substantive clause was added by the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland in 1983. A further clause was added by the Thirteenth Amendment in 1992 in response to the X Case, protecting the freedom to travel to another state to obtain an abortion. A referendum to replace Article 40.3.3¬∞ with a permissive clause allowing legislation by the Oireachtas was passed in May 2018 and was signed into law in September 2018. The specific legislation regulating abortions, the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018, was enacted in December 2018. Abortion services began on 1 January 2019. Court case On 21 November 1997, the District Court made an order that C could leave the country. The parents challenged this order in the High Court, but the court upheld the original order, allowing the EHB to bring her to the UK for an abortion. The court relied on the judgment in the X Case and the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. Reaction The then Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, Desmond Connell, strongly criticised the ruling; however, he declined to fund a Supreme Court challenge. Archbishop Connell claimed that abortion caused mental health problems: Youth Defence picketed the home of EHB Chair R√≥is√≠n Shortall because she didn't stop the case. The Pro Life Campaign criticised the EHB, and called for a full inquiry. Legacy The woman at the centre of the case has occasionally spoken about her experiences, but not revealed her identity. She found the abortion traumatic, and didn't understand what was going on at the time. She didn't know that she would be getting an abortion, and thought that the hospital were going to deliver her baby. In 2009, the rapist was sentenced to 21 years for another rape, this time of an 86-year-old woman in 2008.

The episode was written by Alison Schapker and Grainne Godfree and directed by Jesse Warn. It was first broadcast on October 21, 2014 in The CW. The show is itself a spin-off of the show Arrow, where many characters in the series were introduced during the second season. The episode revolves about Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), a CSI forensic scientist working for the Central City Police Department. The S.T.A.R. Labs team is currently investigating the rampage of a man who seems to control gases and smokes to kill the people who sentenced him to jail. Meanwhile, Wells and Cisco consider using the particle accelerator as a jail for the metahumans, reminding Caitlin when her fianc√©e died trying to stop the explosion of the particle accelerator. Meanwhile, Iris and Eddie consider telling Joe about their relationship. The episode received positive reviews, with critics stating that the series has found a balance after three episodes. Plot A crime family gathers in a restaurant when suddenly, a green smoke appears in the restaurant and kills them all. While investigating the scene, Barry Allen suggests to Joe West that a metahuman that can cause gases may be involved as the doors and windows were bulletproof and closed. Joe also tells Barry that he will reopen Nora's murder in order to free his dad from jail. Upon seeing that Iron Heights Penitentiary may not hold the metahumans, Harrison Wells and Cisco Ramon propose using the particle accelerator as a jail, causing a trauma to Caitlin Snow. In a flashback to 9 months ago, the particle accelerator is successfully launched and everyone celebrates. However, wine began levitating and alarms were heard. In an attempt to shut it down, her fianc√©e Ronnie Raymond entered the particle accelerator but was killed in the process. In a mall elevator, a woman is killed by a man using green smoke. Barry finds the man being formed by the smoke, rather than controlling it. He fights him but he transforms into smoke before he is attacked and spreads gas on Barry. Barry arrives at S.T.A.R. Labs and is forced to administer an antidote and take a sample from his blood. After investigation, they find the man is Kyle Nimbus, he was a hitman for the crime family but he was arrested and the family testified against him and he was supposedly executed when the particle accelerator exploded. This explains that the woman was the judge who gave the sentence and the family. They deduce that the officer who arrested him may be the next target. To Barry's shock, Joe is the one who arrested him. Joe is visiting Henry Allen, who tells him that he reopened the investigation of Nora Allen's death and to clear his name. Suddenly, Nimbus appears and poisons Joe. Barry gives him the antidote and goes after Nimbus. The team deduce that if Nimbus keeps trying hard in catch him, then he will lose his power. Barry then lures him on a chase in the road, where he manages to overexert himself and Barry punches him to finally detain him. In the hospital, Iris and Eddie prepare to tell him of their relationship but Joe reveals he already knew and although a bit upset, he gives them his blessing. Meanwhile, Nimbus is transferred to the new cells in S.T.A.R. Labs, which proves to be efficient in keeping him. Another flashback reveals that during the particle accelerator explosion, Wells entered in his secret room and saw camera footage showing Barry getting hit by the lighting. He states that they will see soon. Release =Broadcast= \\"Things You Can't Outrun\\" was first aired in the United States on The CW on October 21, 2014. It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on CTV. =Home media= The episode, along with the rest of The Flashs first season, was released on Blu-ray and DVD on September 22, 2015.

This was a 16% decrease in viewership from the pilot, which was watched by 4.27 million viewers with a 1.7 rating in the 18-49 demographics. The Flash ranked as the most watched program on The CW in the day, beating Supernatural and also the most watched in the week, beating Arrow. =Critical response= \\"Things You Can't Outrun\\" received positive reviews from critics. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'Things You Can't Outrun' proved that this show can get by just fine focusing on the supporting cast as much as it does Barry Allen. Thanks to the copious flashbacks we learned more about what drives Caitlin, Cisco, and Dr. Wells and saw Ronnie Raymond make his big debut. It would be nice if the same level of attention could be paid to the villains one of these weeks, but hopefully it's only a matter of time.\\" The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak gave the episode a \\"B-\\" grade and wrote, \\"Three episodes in, The Flash remains the most likeable superhero show on television, but it's also flirting with becoming the most formulaic. It's way too early to say the show is stuck in a rut, and there is some forward movement on a few plot strands, but the general contours of 'Things You Can't Outrun' line up pretty closely with what we've seen already. We've got another freak of the week plucked from deep in the DC Comics vault, another pep talk for Barry when he feels being a superhero is too much for him to handle, and another tag scene with Dr. Wells being ambiguously futuristic and evil.\\" Chancellor Agard of Entertainment Weekly stated: \\"Superhero shows and movies live and die on the strength of their supporting casts. Because these stories are so larger-than-life, it's important the supporting characters be developed enough to ground the comic book action: Smallville had Lex, Chloe, Lois, and Clark‚Äôs parents, and Arrow has Felicity and Diggle. The main problem with The Flash ‚Äî which, admittedly, is only three episodes in ‚Äî has been how unremarkable the people around Barry (who aren't Detective Joe West and Dr. Harrison Wells) have been. 'Things You Can‚Äôt Outrun' takes some necessary steps toward solving this problem and also gives us a better sense of what The Flashs low-key episodes will look like.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \\"With these first three episodes as an admittedly small sample, I would say the strengths of 'The Flash' trend more towards the fun than the angst ‚Äî that's what 'Arrow' is for ‚Äî but I also recognize the danger of making the show feel lightweight rather than light. Plus, the show has a bunch of good dramatic actors to work with, and the fact that there are clear stakes in turn makes the lighter and/or triumphant moments have more impact. It's a balance that Berlanti and company will have to carefully maintain going forward, but it's worked for the most part so far.\\" References The Flash (2014 TV series) episodes 2014 American television episodes Television episodes about revenge Television episodes about serial killers ","title":"Things You Can't Outrun"},{"id":"51307337","text":"Agnes Torres is a transgender woman who participated in Harold Garfinkel's research in the early 1960s, making her the first subject of an in-depth discussion of transgender identity in sociology. A modern case study revealed symptoms of malingering. She is the subject of a 2018 documentary short. Early life Torres was born in 1939 and assigned male at birth. She was the youngest of four children. Her mother worked in an aircraft plant; her machinist father died when she was eight. Torres was raised Catholic, but stopped believing in God when she was older.From the age of twelve, Torres took her mother's post-hysterectomy estrogen pills and feminized her body. At seventeen, she began dressing and acting in a feminine manner. In 1958 she was working as a typist for an insurance company, and had a boyfriend. She resisted his desire for intercourse and marriage, leading to a series of quarrels before she disclosed her details to him. Their relationship continued. Appearance When Garfinkel first met Torres, she possessed physiology typically associated with the social categories of \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" at the same time. She had a penis and testicles as well as secondary female characteristics such as breasts. Garfinkel stated: Medical history Torres was found to have XY chromosomes, and neither a uterus nor the hypothesized tumor that might produce estrogen. She was referred to Dr. Robert Stoller, and was interviewed by him; Dr. Alexander Rosen, a psychologist; and Harold Garfinkel, a sociologist interested in the way sex works in society. Torres was taken to be an example of testicular feminization syndrome. She refused to meet or be classified with any other transgender people or homosexuals. She was recommended for surgery as an intersex patient, at a time when such surgery was regularly denied to transgender people. Surgery was done in 1959 by a team of doctors including Elmer Belt. Stoller presented his findings at the 1963 International Psychoanalytic Congress in Stockholm; Garfinkel included an extensive chapter on Agnes in his pioneering 1967 book on ethnomethodology. Post-operative infection and partial closure of her neovagina, weight loss that led to a reduction in breast size, and unpredictable mood changes led to problems with her boyfriend. In 1966 Torres confessed to Stoller that she had indeed taken external estrogens, causing Stoller to doubt his own theories. He retracted his earlier findings at the 1968 International Psychoanalytic Congress in Copenhagen.

They have been an all-female band since 2004. History The band was originally formed as troubadours for a live action role-playing game, but quickly expanded beyond that niche. The young band played their first concert as a support band for Saltatio Mortis (then already a well-known up-and-coming act) in Cologne in early 2001. They found a producer in Roland Kempen of Die Streuner, with whom they would produce their first four albums over the next five years. During this time, several members dropped out to pursue or concentrate on academic or professional careers as the band gradually evolved from a mere hobby venture into an increasingly professional music project. Between 2006 and 2008 the band was reorganized around longtime members Brigitta Jaroschek and Stephanie Keup. They started their own production firm which has been producing the group's albums ever since the fifth. Typically a quintet, Die Irrlichter have performed with any number of musicians between two and six, and have increasingly been performing as a trio since 2013, with different lineups from a core group of regulars. Personnel *Brigitta Jaroschek (n√©e Karin) - Founding member, sings and plays various string instruments including harp, guitar, cister, bass lute, and mandolin. She is a M.A. graduate in Scandinavian Sciences and currently works as a researcher and old Norse teacher at the University of Bonn. *Stephanie Keup-B√ºser - A core member who joined the band shortly after its inception, she sings and plays several instruments including most notably the nyckelharpa, recorders, and shawm. She originally came to the medieval scene not as a musician but as a participant in jousting tournaments, as she is a riding sports and vaulting trainer and paramedic. *Daniela Heiderich - Became a full member in 2007 while she studied psychology at the University of Bonn. After graduation she decided to move to France to study traditional harp and bagpipes (Cornemuse du Centre) at the Conservatoire √† rayonnement r√©gional de Poitiers. After graduating there she now works as a professional musician and teacher, and is also an accomplished dancer. *Annika Thoma - Initially a fan, then a guest (including contributions on cello to the 2015 album, Zaubergarten) and finally a full member after 2015. She sings and primarily plays shawm, recorders, and bagpipes. In her day job she is a trained nurse and nurse teacher. 2009 in Braunschweig Left to right: Stephanie Keup-B√ºser, Jutta Simon-Alt, Brigitta Jaroschek, Jutta Tiedge, Daniela Heiderich Many former band members still do perform with the band occasionally, including *Anna Karin - Founding member, full member until 2007.

General Manager of Security Solutions, Andrew Pyke, said in an interview with Momentum that the company had seized the opportunity after market research had identified future growth in intelligence markets. He said \\"This has been something that Michael Ward and Gerard Foley, in particular, have been working on for several years as part of our company strategy, with strong support from Lynn Dugle and the Raytheon Intelligence and Information Systems team in the US.\\" At its formation, Security Solutions' main market was defined as the civil and defence agencies of the Australian Intelligence Community (AIC) and the intelligence community of Allied nations. Five key areas were identified for Security Solutions to capitalise upon: Cybersecurity, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Intelligence Operations Support and Geospatial solutions. Pyke said the unit would focus on building Government- grade solutions while partnering with other companies better suited to commercial markets. He described the business unit as \\"one of major importance in keeping our nation and Allies safe through use of our leading edge technology.\\"  Woomera test range  As of 2016, Raytheon Australia is upgrading the Woomera Test Range in partnership with the Australian Defence Force and several Australian contractors including CEA Technologies, Daronmont Technologies and Cirrus Technologies. Once complete, the project is expected to deliver \\"the world‚Äôs largest, and most advanced overland test range.\\" The range will be used to test F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and support the United States Armed Forces.

The melody, Zahn No. 7173, was written by Johann Rudolf Ahle who collaborated with the poet. It begins with a sequence of three consecutive rising whole tone intervals. The hymn's last stanza was used by Johann Sebastian Bach as the closing chorale of his cantata O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60. His setting has been quoted in music, notably in Alban Berg's Violin Concerto.  History  Franz Joachim Burmeister wrote \\"\\" in 1662. The topic is a yearning for death. It is inspired by the sentiment the prophet Elijah expresses in the First Book of Kings: \\"It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers\\" (). All seven stanzas begin and end with the line \\"\\". It was printed in 1844 in the hymnal Gesangbuch zum gottesdienstlichen Gebrauche in den Stadtkirchen zu Leipzig (Hymnal for Use in the Service of the Town Churches of Leipzig), in the section \\"Vorbereitung auf den Tod\\" (\\"Of the preparation for death\\").  Melody and settings  The melody, also from 1662, is by Johann Rudolf Ahle, who collaborated with Burmeister on several hymns. He was church musician at Divi Blasii in M√ºhlhausen, a position Bach later also held. The tune begins with an unusual motif of three upward whole-tone intervals, the first half of a whole- tone scale and also the first three notes of the diatonic Lydian mode.BWV 60.5 bach-chorales.com\\"Bach's chorale 'Es ist genug, so nimm, Herr' (Breitkopf und Hartel, No. 216) ought probably to be considered a Lydian choral\\": William Renwick, \\"Bach and the 'Old' Musicology\\", Music Analysis 16, no. 2 (July 1997): 255‚Äì269. Citation on 263. The interval from the first to the fourth note is a tritone, sometimes called diabolus in musica (devil in music). Alfred D√ºrr writes that the opening \\"might have been felt outrageous\\" at the time of its composition, \\"only justified as a musical figure depicting the soul's crossing over from life into death\\".Bach used the hymn's last stanza to conclude his cantata O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60, and it has often been quoted, notably in Alban Berg's Violin Concerto. Berg wrote variations on the chorale in the concerto's last movement. It was his last finished work. Otto Klemperer wrote in the newspaper Wiener Tag on 21 October 1936: \\"The second movement begins with the J. S. Bach chorale 'Es ist genug': 'It is enough! Lord, if it please Thee, my Jesus, come! World, good night. I go to the heavenly house, with a heart full of joy. My sorrows remain below.' The variations on this chorale, the sounds that emanate from the violin, that bring into being a completely new world for the instrument, the way in which at the conclusion the music seems to span the cosmos, from the lowest depths to the sublime heights\\".

The President of the Latvian Republic Valdis Zatlers at the Honorary Consulate of Latvia, 27 June 2008. Building at 57 Chornovil Ave., where the Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Latvia in Lviv is located. The Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Latvia in Lviv was founded on 12 February 1992. Its primary aim was to deepen bilateral inter-regional partnerships and extend cooperation in areas of trade, economics, and cultural relations. Its first representative in Lviv was Volodymyr Hartsyla, a well-known local entrepreneur, public figure, and head of the \\"BEEM\\" group. The consular office began operating on the 20 July 2005. A delegation headed by the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Latvia to Ukraine, Andris VilcƒÅns, participated in the opening ceremony. The main areas of activity of the consulate include the establishment and development of business, academic, and cultural contacts between Latvia and Ukraine, support of Latvian citizens during their stay in the territory of the consular district, and the organisation of different educational and cultural events. In June 2008, the Office was involved in organizing the President of the Latvian Republic Valdis Zatlers' visit to Lviv during his state visit to Ukraine. During this visit, and with the assistance of Honorary Consul V. Hartsula, a number of cooperative agreements were signed between Lviv, Riga, and other towns of the Lviv region and Latvia (Drohobych, Pustomyty and Smiltene, Zhovkva and Cƒìsis, Truskavets and Ludza). For his contributions to the Latvian Republic, V. Hartsula was awarded the oldest Latvian order, 'The Cross of Recognition' in September 2008. The Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Latvia is located at 57 Chornovil Ave. History Official Latvian-Polish relations were initiated on 27 January 1921, when Poland recognized the Latvian Republic. The first consulate of the Latvian Republic in Lviv started its work in June 1929. Jurisdiction of the Consulate extended to all eastern voivodeships of the then Second Polish Republic, including Lviv. In May 1929 Wit Sulimirski was appointed the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Latvia in Lviv. He was an oil manufacturer known in Lviv and Halychyna, owned oil fields in Krosno County, was a member of the supervisory council of the Polish Industrial Bank, and was the JSC \\"Gazolina\\", chair of the Democratic Club in Lviv. The Latvian Consulate was located then at 1 Romanovych St. (presently 1 Sakahansky St., building of the biological faculty of the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv), in the office facilities of the Dnister Oil Union \\"Desna\\", to which the head of the representation had direct ties. The Polish-American Emigration (Colonization) Syndicate was located in the same building. Sulimirski taking office as the Latvian Consul in Lviv coincided with conclusion of the revolutionary agreement of the Lviv Gas Plant and JSC \\"Gazolina\\" on the construction of a gas pipeline Dashava-Lviv (68 km) to the Lviv Gas Plant, supplying it with natural gas. Successful cooperation with JSC 'Gazolina' continued until 1939 when the new regime created the Stryi Production Division of the People's Commissariat of Oil Industry of the USSR.

After the Spanish conquest of the islands, some of that lava was covered with soil to allow for some farming. The tumuli are also built of volcanic rocks. Most of them are built on elliptic or round plans with a truncated cone outline. Some of them reach 8 m diameter and 3 m in height. Inside each tumulus is a pit with its sides marked by stone slabs, in which the deceased bodies were placed. Some coffins have also been found inside some tumuli. The size and building refinement vary noticeably among the tumuli, indicating the social ranks of their occupiers. The particularity of some of these small tumuli are the stones that crown them, which are of different colours and texture than the surrounding volcanic material. The most common ones are a simple ring of volcanic stones, the more sophisticated ones are topped with turret-type stonework and were probably used to bury nobility. Most of the tumuli are occupied by a single individual ; some shelter two individuals. Some children have also been buried in the cemetery. Part of the cemetery space has been surrounded with a dry-stone wall. Some tumuli were built beyond that wall; 8 corpses were found there. Historians think that these people were either Canarians deemed unworthy of burial in the proper ground, or foreigners having landed on the island before the Spanish conquest. ; Traces left by a tsunami The site bears traces of one of the rare tsunami to be documented in the Canaries. It was created by a volcanic emission in the municipality of G√º√≠mar in Tenerife. These traces consist of white stains of marine deposits left behind by the tsunami waves beating on the steep sides of the valley.

Now widely manufactured, they are available in a range of standard sizes and materials Dowty Seal taken over by Trelleborg sealing solutions. Bonded Seals are made by Trelleborg in the United Kingdom to the original specification. A bonded seal consists of an outer annular ring of a hard material, typically steel, and an inner annular ring of an elastomeric material that acts as a gasket. It is the compression of the elastomeric part between the faces of the parts on either side of the bonded seal that provides the sealing action. The elastomeric material, typically nitrile rubber, is bonded by heat and pressure to the outer ring, which holds it in place. This structure increases resistance to bursting, increasing the pressure rating of the seal. Because the bonded seal itself acts to retain the gasket material, there is no need for the parts to be sealed to be shaped to retain the gasket. This results in simplified machining and greater ease of use as compared to some other seals, such as O-rings. Some designs come with an additional flap of rubber on the internal diameter to locate the bonded seal at the centre of the hole, these are called self-centring bonded washers References Seals (mechanical) ","title":"Bonded seal"},{"id":"51307919","text":"USS LST-573 was a United States Navy used in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during World War II.

Biography Mendel was born in the town of Vi»ôeu de Sus, Romania, which was then within the borders of Austria-Hungary. He was the son of Rabbi Dov Berish Elefant and his wife Bava Elefant (n√©e Eisenberger). His father, a rabbi and a dayan (religious judge), was fluent in six languages,Rabbi Chaim Hirsch Manheimmer, Ein Habdolach, NYC: Zecharya Elefant, 1944, pp. 1-6 (preface). and was a bank manager for many years. His mother, Bava, was a businesswoman, and was the mother of 12 children, while some children died at an early age. When Mendel was 11 years old his mother died of liver cancer, and his father remarried later on. Mendel studied at the local Talmud Torah at Vi»ôeu de Sus, and continued on to study at the Yeshivot of Northern Romania and Czechoslovakia, one of them being the Yeshiva of Siget. During his adult years he moved to Czechoslovakia and lived there. During the 1920s, Mendel immigrated to Brazil, to the city of Rio de Janeiro, in order to save money towards his upcoming marriage with his fianc√©e, whom he married upon his return to Czechoslovakia. While in Rio de Janeiro, Mendel published poems and literary articles in local journals and newspapers.Malamud, Shmuel.

During the Nazi invasion and the outbreak of World War II, Mendel was on a mission in Warsaw and fled towards Lithuania. His wife and child in Lvov fled to Lithuania as well, and they were reunited in Vilna. Mendel had been walking in the snow for a long period of time, he developed gangrene and once he arrived in Vilna - the doctors had to amputate his toes, among other things. Later, his health continued to deteriorate, and he couldn't continue to run and was caught by the Germans. The year of death is estimated at 1942. His wife, Ilonka Elefant, and his young son who was approximately 10 years old (known fondly as \\"Pindichku\\"), continued to run until they were eventually intercepted by the Germans and were taken to a concentration camp. Upon arrival at the camp, a Nazi officer noticed the boy who was very handsome and had light blonde hair and blue eyes, and was a talented violinist. He took the boy to his house as a companion for his own son who was his age. Ilonka Elefant perished in the camps, but managed to smuggle out a letter to her sister in hiding through a non-Jewish woman who worked at the camp every day, telling her what had befallen her son.and asking that she find him once the opportunity arose. After the War, Ilonka's sister went to wealthy relatives in South America and they hired private investigators who were able to trace this Nazi Officer from camp to camp, but ultimately lost track of him when the war ended and the camps dissolved. No one knows what happened to the child, and it was assumed that the Nazi officer had eventually killed him.

The term \\"discretionary\\" refers to investment decisions being made by the investment manager based on the investment manager's judgement rather than under the direction of the client. The major aim of the services offered is to outperform benchmarks listed in the mandate; this is called providing alpha. The services provided are usually tailored for institutional business, pension funds and high-net worth individuals. The investment management company has a continuing responsibility to ensure that an investment portfolio is suitable for the client's attitude to risk and investment objectives.  Investment products  Discretionary investment managers may manage investments in any type of securities, according to the investment manager's strategy. The most common investment products are stocks, bonds, ETFs and financial derivatives. All the investment products in the scope of the investment manager's strategy must be outlined in an investment mandate.  Investment process  Due to the nature of the service, discretionary investment management firms provide a mandate in order to ensure that the services that are offered meet the aims of the client's financial goals. The process is structured in a way for the client's capital to be invested according to the strategies specified in the investment mandate. Clients choosing a specific strategy will get the same strategy ‚Äì there is no investment tailoring for the specific client, and the investment capital from a group of investors will be invested at the same time, as in a mutual fund or hedge fund, although each actual client account is segregated and the monies invested will be weighted in proportion to the individual's capital. For example, the investment manager may make a decision to invest 1% of invested funds in a particular security, so a ¬£10,000,000 account will contribute ¬£100,000 to the transaction whilst a ¬£1,000,000 account will contribute ¬£10,000. The most common process is using a systematic approach. This process is widely used because it allows the investment strategies to be exercised in a specific way and makes it easier to report results.  Investment management fees  Investment management fees can include: *Assets under management (AUM) fees: Most discretionary investment management companies charge an assets under management (AUM) fee, typically at an annual rate of 0.1%‚Äì4% of the value of the managed asset portfolio. * Transaction fees: In addition to an AUM fee, a fee may be charged when executing transactions. * Performance fees (as a percentage of profits): This is a fee charged as a share of the profit generated for the client, usually 10%‚Äì30% of the profits. With this type of fee, the client does not need to pay when the fund is losing money.  In the United Kingdom  In the UK, the regulatory authority for discretionary investment management companies is the Financial Conduct Authority, and investment managers are required to have a graduate degree or an investment qualification such as the Chartered Financial Analyst designation (CFA).

The Club also achieved great success in cup hockey, with multiple wins in the Hockey Association Cup and the European Cup in 1990. The move to Duke's Meadow provided access to a first class pitch and the success of the men's 1st XI continued into the mid-nineties. However, during this period membership numbers of both men's and women's sections declined. Retirement of many key members of the men's 1st XI, who could not be easily replaced, resulted in relegation through the leagues and loss of status, reinforcing the difficulty in recruiting new members. In 2000-2001 season the club merged with Ealing Ladies Hockey Club to form Hounslow and Ealing Ladies Hockey Club but this failed to stem the gradual decline of the club. In 2005 the club went out of existence, with the men's section joining Richmond Hockey Club and the women's section merging with Barnes Hockey Club, playing for a period under the name of Barnes Hounslow and Ealing, before reverting to simply Barnes Hockey Club.

The salt shaker style light, which sits on a small hillock on the Cape Breton side of the canal, is the second lighthouse to be built on the site. History The first lighthouse at Balache point was built in 1905, it displayed a fixed white light from a wooden tower. A fog horn was added in 1908, and it housed a 5th order lens from 1922 to 1941. The light was decommissioned in the 1950s. Lighthouse keepers were Allan Nicholson and Catherine Nicholson. Lighthouse in 2014 The current lighthouse was built in 1963, as the rear beacon of a pair of range lights, helping to guide vessels into the canal at its northern end. The canal and its locks, allows ships to pass through the Canso Causeway, which crosses the Strait of Canso. The front range light, built at the same time, was of a similar design, until replaced in 1991 by a more functional skeletal tower next to the water's edge. Description The tapering wooden tower is of the salt shaker design, painted white, with a red lantern and balcony, although pictures from 2008 show an all-white tower and lantern. It has a broad vertical red stripe to mark the range line, matching the stripe on the front range tower. Both the front and rear lights display an occulting yellow light, flashing every eleven seconds, and both have a range of 16 nautical miles. The light is automatic, but only operates seasonally between April and December.

In 1853 the University of Edinburgh granted him a doctorate (MD) but it is unclear if this is where his original medical training took place. From 1853 he began taking on educational roles at firstly the University of Edinburgh then in 1855 added lecturing at the newly founded Dick Vet School, then in the New Town alongside its founder, William Dick.

Whilst his work clearly is of great quality only one public work is known, it is therefore presumed that he specialised in figurative work as largely private commissions. In 1910 he joined the Territorial branch of the Lothian and Border Horse Regiment. As a territorial, he was immediately called into service at the onset of the First World War. He transferred as a Lieutenant to the Royal Field Artillery and won the Military Cross from bravery in November 1917 for the rescue of two men from the battlefield during the Second Battle of Passchendaele.The London Gazette, 26 November 1917 He was thereafter promoted to the rank of Major.

Fundraising activities are done in Sweden as well as Germany and the United States. History The founding of Barnens Regnskog was inspired by the fundraising of 9-year-old elementary school student Roland Tiensuu, his teacher Eha Kern and her husband Bernd Kern. In 1987 Eha Kern, while teaching at Fagerviks School in Sorunda (Nyn√§shamn Municipality), invited an American biologist to show slides and speak to her class about Costa Rica's Monteverde Reserve. The lecture was put into a wider context of the destruction of the tropical rainforests. The lecture had a deep impression on the children. Roland Tiensuu suggested that he and his classmates should raise funds for the Monteverde Reserve's land purchase program. They started with a bake sale, which helped raise enough money to purchase of rainforest for the reserve. Further money was raised by the children through selling cards, painting and handicrafts. Soon after, thousands of rainforest groups were forming in schools and churches around Sweden and were put together in the Barnens Regnskog organization. The first Barnens Regnskog rainforest reserve was established in 1989 in the Monteverde Reserve. The Barnens Regnskog part of the reserve today spans .

The combined evidence in the form of texts and wall reliefs provide the best documented description of a battle in all of ancient history. The Egyptian version of the battle of Kadesh is recorded in two primary accounts, known as the Bulletin and the Poem. These inscriptions exist in multiple locations. Some scholars divide these accounts into three. The Bulletin is repeated seven times and the Poem eight times, spread across temples in Abydos, Temple of Luxor, Karnak, Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum, and two hieratic papyri.: \\"Subsequently the campaign was told al length in two separate accounts which scholars have called the Bulletin (or the Record) and the Poem. The two accounts are supplemented by pictorial reliefs with explanatory captions. The whole composition offers a number of striking features. First the fact that there are two distinct though overlapping accounts. Second the fact that the two versions were not merely carved once on the walls of a temple but were repeated in multiple copies ‚Äì the Bulletin seven times and the Poem eight times. They are inscribed on the walls of the temples of Abydos, Luxor, Karnak, Abu Simbel and the Ramesseum, and the Poem is also found on fragments of two hieratic papyri. Poem The Poem or \\"Poem of Pentaur\\" (pntAwr.t) is known from eight inscriptions, and lists the peoples which went to Kadesh as allies of the Hittites. Amongst them are some of the Sea Peoples and many of the other peoples who would later take part in battles of the 12th century BC (see Battle of Kadesh). The Poem has been questioned as actual verse, as opposed to a prose account similar to what other pharaohs had recorded. Bulletin The Bulletin or the Record is itself simply a lengthy caption accompanying the reliefs.Gardiner, Alan, The Kadesh Inscriptions of Ramesses II (1975) pp. 2‚Äì4. However, Miriam Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 2: The New Kingdom (1978) p. 58, maintains that the Poem is truly just that, contra Gardiner, and prefers to maintain the older tripartite division of the documentation. Eight copies survive today on the temples at Abydos, Karnak, Luxor and Abu Simbel, with reliefs depicting the battle.

This had been agreed at an earlier meeting on the island, on 7 November 1659, which saw the signing of the Treaty of the Pyrenees by the chief ministers. Pheasant Island lies on the river Bidasoa that is still the border between France and Spain, and the tiny island remains joint territory to this day. Those present included, from Spain, Maria Theresa, the Count-Duque of Olivares, chief minister, as well as one of the organisers of the meeting, and the painter Diego Vel√°zquez, who was then sixty years of age. Such grand meetings between reigning monarchs had become increasingly rare in the 17th century. On the French side, there was the widowed queen Anne of Austria, sister of King Philip and mother of Louis XIV, the duke Philippe I of Orleans and Cardinal Mazarin, the chief minister. The meeting was later (by about 1660) depicted in a tapestry in a series on the life of Louis XIV, designed by Charles Le Brun, an example of which is in the Palace of Versailles.

Early life  In 1990, Frassineti completed his study in geography at University of Bologna.  Career  In June 2009, he took over the office of mayor of the municipality of Predappio with a center-left coalition. The village of 6,000 inhabitants in the Italian region of Emilia- Romagna is most widely known as the birthplace of Mussolini. Because of Predappio's historical significance, it was of particular concern to Frassineti to preserve buildings from the 20th century. Frassineti developed the idea of an international documentation centre of the 20th century.  Documentation Centre of the 20th century  The documentation centre was planned to house a permanent exhibition in a space of 1000 square meters to be developed by Italian and international historians under the supervision of the Parri Institute from Bologna. In addition, space would be left for other projects that allow a critical and objective examination of the time period and at the same time cause a \\"learning from the past\\". The project planned to cooperate with the House of Responsibility for Adolf Hitler's birthplace in Braunau am Inn. Among others, the documentation center could receive an Austrian Holocaust Memorial Servant. In September 2011, Frassineti followed an invitation from Andreas Maislinger and Oscar-winner Branko Lustig to participate in the 20. Braunauer Zeitgeschichte-Tage titled \\"Difficult Heritage\\". On 19 July 2016, the district council of Predappio officially gave the Parri Institute permission to proceed with the documentation centre. Costs were estimated to be 3,000,000 euros of which 2,000,000 euros will be provided by the region of Emilia-Romagna from the European Union Structural Fund.

Crashlytics helps collecting, analyzing and organizing app crash reports. Its main product is a software development kit for crash reporting, application logging, online review and statistical analysis of application logs. It supports iOS, Android and Unity. In January 2013, Twitter acquired Crashlytics for over $100 million. Most of the package was in stock vesting over four years with an upfront payment of $38.2 million in common Twitter stock. In January 2017, Google announced that it signed an agreement to acquire Crashlytics and its offspring creations including Fabric and Answers. The acquisition would bolster its existing efforts in mobile by becoming part of the Firebase platform and known as Firebase Crashlytics.  History  Wayne Chang and Jeff Seibert co-founded Crashlytics in 2011. The company raised $1 million from venture capitalists Flybridge Capital Partners and Baseline Ventures as well as individual angel investors. In April 2012, Crashlytics raised an additional $5 million. In March 2012, under privacy pressure, Apple began to deprecate the UDID ‚Äì the unique identifier that ties a user to a specific phone. In response, the Crashlytics team built and released SecureUDID, an open-source alternative to UDID. In June 2012, Crashlytics acquired FireTower.app, a tool used to detect JavaScript errors in websites. This acquisition was to help expand Crashlytics beyond mobile apps and into the mobile web. FireTower.app was a Boston-based company. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but Crashlytics co-founder Wayne Chang says the other side is ‚Äúvery happy.‚Äù In January 2013, about a year after Crashlytics launched, Twitter announced it had acquired the Boston, Massachusetts-based software company. The acquisition price was pegged at over $100 million (valued at about $259 million when Twitter IPO'd), which was Twitter's largest acquisition at the time. In May 2015, SourceDNA released a report that showed Crashlytics as #1 in terms of adoption and usage by apps. The data also showed that Crashlytics was more than #2‚Äì6 combined. In August 2016, MightySignal shows Crashlytics as in 42% of the top 200, which included apps like Twitter, Uber, Amazon, Spotify, Pinterest and many others. In January 2017, four years after Twitter made the acquisition, Google announced it had signed an agreement to acquire Crashlytics.  Fabric  In October 2014, Crashlytics announced Fabric, an expansion of functionality into mobile app analytics, beta distribution, and user identity and authentication. Fabric represented the first introduction of a modular SDK platform, which allowed developers to pick and choose which features they needed while guaranteeing ease of installation and compatibility across all. By further tying distribution of MoPub (mobile advertising) and TwitterKit (login with Twitter and Tweet display functionality) to Fabric/Crashlytics, Twitter was able to take advantage of Crashlytics' large adoption and device footprint to rapidly scale usage of its own mobile developer products. Because of the decision to build on top of Crashlytics, Fabric reached active distribution across 1 Billion mobile devices just 8 months after its launch. The Fabric mobile app launched in early 2016. By the end of 2016, Fabric serves more than 2 billion active devices and processes 310 billion app sessions a month. Through Crashlytics and its mobile analytics service (called Answers by Crashlytics), Fabric was ranked #1 by MightySignal as the most implemented crash reporting and mobile analytics solution among the top 200 iOS apps. In January 2017, Crashlytics and Fabric was acquired by Google. In October 2019, the Fabric team announced that all Fabric features including Crashlytics had been migrated to Firebase and that Fabric would shut down on March 31st, 2020.  Timeline  In October 2011, Crashlytics raised $1 million from Flybridge Capital Partners and Baseline Ventures, along with individual investors David Chang, Lars Albright, Jennifer Lum, Peter Wernau, Roy Rodenstein, Chris Sheehan, Ty Danco, Joe Caruso, and others. In April 2012, Crashlytics raised another $5 million from Flybridge Capital Partners and Baseline Ventures. In June 2012, Crashlytics acquires FireTower.app to expand into the mobile web. In June 2012, Crashlytics wins the MITX Innovation Award from Massachusetts Innovation & Technology Exchange. In January 2013, Twitter acquires Crashlytics for over $100 million (later valued at $259.5 million at Twitter's IPO). In February 2013, Crashlytics announced all Enterprise features were free to all developers. In March 2013, Crashlytics wins the 50 on Fire award. In May 2013, Crashlytics announces support for Android. In February 2014, Crashlytics announces \\"Beta by Crashlytics\\", its mobile app beta distribution tool. In October 2014, Crashlytics announces Fabric, a modular mobile platform to build apps. In May 2015, a third-party site, SourceDNA, ranked Crashlytics as #1 in mobile performance. In May 2015, Crashlytics announces native (NDK) support for Android was announced. In October 2015, Crashlytics announces support for Unity (game engine), the most popular mobile game engine. In December 2015, Crashlytics announces support for Apple's tvOS. In August 2016, Crashlytics was ranked #1 most adopted crash reporting SDK among the top 200 iOS apps by MightySignal. In December 2016, Answers was ranked #1 most adopted mobile analytics SDK by MightSignal. In January 2017, Crashlytics and Fabric were acquired by Google. In September 2018, Google announces that Fabric will be deprecated and developers should use Crashlytics via Firebase. In October 2019, Google announces that Fabric will be deprecated on March 31, 2020. Crashlytics and other Fabric products will continue as part of Firebase.

Biography  Both an author, typographer, or bookbinder, Castaing who by profession was collector of the taille in his hometown, is the author of several plays printed by himself in his print shop. This collection, whose plays have been described as \\"as bad as misprinted\\", has no other merit than its rarity. The author says ingenuously in his preface that by printing 30 copies of his theater, \\"he had no other purpose than to distract himself, without the annoyance to bother over thirty people\\". According to the same preface, it seems that this theater was to consist of four volumes, unless one counts for the fourth volume la Femme curieuse, printed in 1793, and which is part of Volume III. Because of this, his poetry and theater are extremely rare. The local historian L√©on de La Sicoti√®re had his complete theatrical and poetic productions, printed to a very small number of copies in his rich library. Several of Castaing's plays have been performed on the stage of Alencon. Founder of the Alen√ßonnaise Masonic lodge (\\"Saint-Louis-des-C≈ìurs-Z√©l√©s\\"), in 1752, he represented the masonry from Orne at the creation of the Grand Orient de France in 1773.

It was ruled by the Noble Lords, later Counts, of Diepholz from the late tenth century until 1585, when it was mostly incorporated into the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg.  Territorial Borders  The territory of the County of Diepholz at its greatest extent in the sixteenth century stretched from Colnrade and Goldenstedt in the north to Wehdem, Dielingen and Lemf√∂rde in the south. The eastern border was marked by the Wietings Moor (near Barver) and the Neust√§dter Moor (near Wagenfeld). The western border lay to the west of the D√ºmmer See (lake). The distance from the northernmost point to the southernmost point of the county was about 47 kilometers whilst the distance from east to west was 22 kilometers at its widest point.Bach, Otto, Heimatgeschichte im Spiegel der Karte, Diepholz 1999.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 16. The towns of Diepholz, Drebber and Lemf√∂rde, as well as the area around the Auburg Castle (most notably Wagenfeld) fell directly under the allodial rule of the Noble Lords of Diepholz. Their properties in Barnstorf, Goldenstedt and Colnrade fell under the full jurisdiction of the Noble Lords from 1291 in their capacity as holders of the Vicecomitat of Sudholte but was a fief of the Bishop of Munster. The Lords of Diepholz were vassals of the Count of Ravensberg for the tithes of Weddeschen and vassals of the Abbey of Corvey for various smaller goods, such as the \\"wood tithes\\" in Bosel. Their tithes in Aschen and Ostenbeck were fiefs of the Counts of Tecklenburg.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 143. The territory of the county includes most of the modern municipalities of Altes Amt Lemf√∂rde, Barnstorf, Rehden, Diepholz und Wagenfeld. The former District County of Diepholz (Landkreis Grafschaft Diepholz) was named after the territory.  The origins of the Noble Lords of Diepholz  The family belonged to the Germanic Uradel (ancient nobility) and originated from the border area between the districts (German: Gau) of Westphalia and Angria (German: Engern) in the stem duchy of Saxony.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 6. In contrast to neighbouring noble dynasties they were not appointed as territorial counts (Latin: comes; German: Graf) or imperial officeholders by the Holy Roman Emperor but exercised allodial power locally as noble landowners.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 105. Whilst their origins go further back in time, the family name first appears in 1160 (in Latinised German) as de Thefholte,Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 105. and a continuous genealogy of the dynasty only starts with Gottschalk I (cited 1177-1205).Hucker, Berend Ulrich ‚ÄûGenealogie und Wappen der Edelherren von Diepholz in 12. und 13. Jahrhundert‚Äú in Norddeutsche Familienkunde, Jahrgang 1990, pp. 180-181. The continuity in ownership of the feudal domains around Drebber, Barnstorf and Goldenstedt, which later belonged to the Noble Lords of Diepholz, suggests that the dynasty descended from or was related to Folcred, who donated a manor in Barnstorf with its serfs around 890-900 to the Abbey of Corvey for the salvation of his brother Alfric's soul. In 1070, another Folker, undoubtedly a descendant of the first, and his wife Badeloch, donated a manor in Goldenstedt to the Bishop of Osnabruck.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 107. The first members of the dynasty of the Noble Lords of Diepholz who can be identified with certainty are domina Gysela, heiress of Drebber and Molbergen, her brother Gottschalk (cited 1080/1088) and his son, Gottschalk, Bishop of Osnabruck (1110-1118). It remains uncertain whether they are agnatic or uterine forebears of the later dynasty.Hucker, Berend Ulrich, ‚ÄûGenealogie und Wappen der Edelherren von Diepholz in 12. und 13. Jahrhundert‚Äú in Norddeutsche Familienkunde, Jahrgang 1990, p. 180. Around 1085 Gysela swapped various goods around Drebber and Diepholz with the Bishop of Osnabruck in return for the manor in Goldenstedt which had previously belonged to Folker.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 108. The German historian Carl Heinrich Niedberding speculated, based on the geographical location of these earliest known estates, that the Noble Lords of Diepholz might descend from the Saxon leader Widukind, but noted that there was no firm proof for such a descent.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 109. The title used by the Noble Lords (German: edler Herr / Edelherr) of Diepholz was identical to that of their close neighbours, the Noble Lords of Lippe, and underlined their credentials as sovereign territorial lords and as members of the ancient Saxon nobility.  The Sovereign Lordship of Diepholz in the Middle Ages  Inverted coat of arms of the Counts of Diepholz (cited as Graue von Diepoldt) (on the left) in the Wernigerode Armorial (ca. 1475-1500).After the fall of Henry the Lion in the late twelfth century, smaller Saxon territories were able to expand their dominions and influence, and the Noble Lords of Diepholz extended their reach to the north and south from their initial allodial holdings around the town and castle of Diepholz, Drebber, Barnstorf and Goldenstedt. The territory's expansion was however constrained by the moors that surrounded it and by the ambitions of its more powerful neighbours, most notably the Counts of Hoya and the Bishops of Minden. The dynasty tended to conclude marriages with the sovereigns of neighbouring territories such as the Counts of Oldenburg, Hoya and Rietberg, and in 1285 Noble Lord Rudolf II of Diepholz (died 1303/04) married the daughter of the Swedish King Valdemar (died 1302). In order to prevent a division of the territory's modest resources, younger sons tended to enter religious life as canons in neighbouring bishoprics such as Osnabr√ºck, Minden, Bremen and Cologne, where some of them also ruled as bishops.Emil Johannes Guttzeit, Geschichte der Stadt Diepholz, Diepholz 1982; p. 142-145.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 6. The prosperity of the Noble Lords of Diepholz was greatly enhanced by the many members of the family who held high ecclesiastical offices, thus enhancing the dynasty's prestige and allowing it to act with increasing independence within its own domains.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 114. Under the joint rule of the brothers Rudolf II (died 1303/04) and Konrad V (cited 1267-1302), the borders of the Lordship were forcefully expanded and sovereignty attained within their core territories by the acquisition in 1291 of the Vicecomitat of Sudholte, which gave them full jurisdiction over their subjects in the parishes of Drebber, Barnstorf and Goldenstedt.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 118. In addition, in 1285, Konrad V, inherited the rich patrimony of the Lords of Blankena from his cousin, Hermann von Blankena.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 116. Konrad V's son, Rudolf IV (cited 1300-1350), continued to actively extend his possessions by his forceful and considered interventions during a very tumultuous period in the region.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), pp.120-125. In 1350, together with his sons and grandchildren, he founded the parish church of Diepholz (which had previously been in Drebber), which he dedicated to Saints Nicholas, Catherine and Elisabeth.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 125. In 1380, Johann III (cited 1373-1422), the grandson of Rudolf IV, granted town rights to Diepholz. His reign was marked by continuous tensions and conflict with and between neighbouring territories in which Diepholz was largely spared any major depredation.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), pp. 129-133. His son, Konrad IX, died as an ally of the Archbishop of Bremen in a battle near Detern in 1426, whilst engaging the Frisian forces of Focko Ukena. In 1441 Otto IV, Konrad IX's son, married Heilwig van Bronkhorst, thanks to the diplomatic efforts of his uncle, Bishop Rudolf van Diepholt of Utrecht. The marriage dowry included properties in the surroundings of Wagenfeld, Bokel and Struten, which consolidated the dynasty's hold on the lands around Auburg castle to the east of their territories. This marriage would also form the basis of the Count of Diepholz's later claims to Bronkhorst when that dynasty died out in 1553.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 135-136.  From Lordship to County  In accordance with their sovereign status and motivated by their marital alliances with neighbouring sovereign counts, the Noble Lords of Diepholz started titling themselves as Counts of Diepholz during the course of the fifteenth century. Rudolf VIII (died 1510) was the first dynast to describe himself as Count of Diepholz in 1482, and Carl Heinrich Niedberding claims that this pretension was recognised by the Emperor Maximilian I.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 137 & 201\\\\. His son, Friedrich I (died 1529), also regularly used the title in his charters and edicts.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), pp. 139-143, 204-206. The comtal title only came to be generally recognised under Count Johann VI.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 17. After the extinction of the main line of the Lords of Bronkhorst in 1553, the Counts of Diepholz also laid claim to that territory based on their descent from Heilwig of Bronkhorst, and subsequently titled themselves Counts of Diepholz and Bronkhorst.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 17.  The County of Diepholz in the Early Modern Period  Diepholz Castle, the principal seat of the Noble Lords, later Counts, of Diepholz. Under constant threat from his more powerful neighbours and after endless hostilities with the Bishop of Minden, Rudolf VIII, son of Otto IV and Heilwig van Bronkhorst, abdicated his absolute sovereignty over Diepholz in 1510 and recognised the Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg as his liege lord in return for the promise of his protection. This agreement was only formally recognised as valid by the Emperor Maximilian I in 1517.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 139. The moor-covered territory of Diepholz had never been particularly wealthy and from Rudolf VIII's reign onwards the dynasty continuously struggled to cover the costs of its administration and the obligations of their semi-sovereign lifestyle.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 16. After the death of Rudolf VIII of Diepholz in 1510, his three sons, Friedrich I, Konrad XII and Johann VI initially ruled over Diepholz as co-sovereigns. The limited means which the territory disposed over however led the brothers to sign a treaty in 1514 recognising Friedrich I as sole ruler and making financial arrangements for the two other brothers to become canons in Cologne.Kinghorst, Dr. Wilhelm, Die Graffschaft Diepholz zur Zeit ihres √úberganges an das Haus Braunschweig-L√ºneburg. Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Graffschaft Diepholz in sechzehnten Jahrhundert, Diepholz 1912 (herdruk 1979); p.9. Friedrich's territories were constantly under attack by the Bishop of Minden, despite the fact that the Archbishop of Cologne, the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor had issued Inhibitoria instructing the bishop to cease hostilities.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p.140. In 1519 Friedrich I joined the coalition of the Prince-Bishop of Hildesheim in the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud (German: Hildesheimer Stiftsfehde), which led to him and his allies being placed under the imperial ban by Emperor Charles V. To further protect his estates while under the imperial ban, Friedrich I, relinquished sovereignty over the territories around Auburg to Landgrave Philip I of Hesse in 1521, who subsequently re-enfeoffed him with them, thus losing the last vestige of full allodial sovereignty that had not already been abdicated to the Dukes of Brunswick-Calenberg.Nieberding, C.H., Geschichte des ehemaligen Niederstifts M√ºnster und der angr√§nzenden Grafschaften Diepholz, Wildeshausen, etc., Vechta 1840 (reprinted 1967), p. 141. In 1523 Friedrich I married Eva von Regenstein, by whom he had a son and daughter, and under whose influence in 1528 he introduced the Reformation into the County of Diepholz.Kinghorst, Dr. Wilhelm, Die Graffschaft Diepholz zur Zeit ihres √úberganges an das Haus Braunschweig-L√ºneburg. Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Graffschaft Diepholz in sechzehnten Jahrhundert, Diepholz 1912 (reprinted 1979). When Friedrich I died in 1529, whilst visiting his sister Imgard in the Abbey of Essen, his brother, Johann VI, returned from Cologne and seized power in Diepholz. He formally agreed with his sister-in-law, Eva of Regenstein, that he would conclude a morganatic marriage in order not to impinge on the rights of his nephew, Rudolf IX, son of Friedrich I, when he came of age.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, p. 17. Johann VI also took care to sign his edicts and charters on behalf of both himself and his nephew.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, pp. 33-34. Count Rudolf IX succeeded his uncle in 1545, and married his cousin, Margarete of Hoya- Nienburg, in 1549, by whom he had a son and a daughter. Their son, Friedrich II, died in 1585, but only left a daughter, Anna Margaretha (died without issue in 1629), by his marriage to Anastasia of Waldeck, who was unable to succeed according to the strictures of Saxon inheritance law. As a result of the 1510 treaty recognising the Duke of Brunswick-L√ºneburg as its liege lord, most of the county was therefore absorbed into the Welf duchy.Kinghorst, Dr. Wilhelm, Die Graffschaft Diepholz zur Zeit ihres √úberganges an das Haus Braunschweig-L√ºneburg. Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte der Graffschaft Diepholz in sechzehnten Jahrhundert, Diepholz 1912 (reprinted 1979). Auburg and its surrounding territories fell to the Landgraviate of Hesse. Irmgard of Diepholz, daughter of Rudolf VIII and Elisabeth of Lippe, had entered Essen Abbey as a religious in 1505 and slowly rose through the ranks to become Princess-Abbess in 1561. Her election as Princess-Abbess procured far greater wealth and influence than her family in Diepholz enjoyed, and she generously dispensed patronage to her niece, Anna von Diepholt, daughter of Friedrich I, who was married to a local nobleman, Adolf von Schuren, Lord of Horst an der Ruhr (died 1552). Anna's son, Evert von Schuren, and his cousins, Count Friedrich II and his sister, Anna, the Coadjutrix of Bassum, were the only heirs of Irmgard when she died in 1575.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, pp. 25-37.  The East-Frisian and Dutch branches of the Diepholz dynasty  Arms of the Van Diepholt family of Utrecht Rudolf IV, succeeded his father as sovereign of Diepholz in 1484, thanks to the premature death of his older brother, Konrad XI (died 1483), who had left progeny by an unknown partner. Konrad XI's son, Otto von Diepholt, married the Frisian noblewoman, Anna Remets Ubbena, sister of Dr. Hayo \\"Hermannus Phrysius\\" Hompen, humanist scholar, Imperial Councillor and correspondent of Erasmus,Bietenholz, Peter G. & Brian,Thomas (editors), Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, Volume 2, Toronto 1985, pp. 157-158. and half-sister of Wilhelm Ubbena, Chancellor of East-Frisia.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, pp. 20-22. Otto was initially a commander of the forces of Count Edzard I of East-Frisia in the Saxon Feud, but later became a supporter and legate of the Habsburg dynasty in the Netherlands, who appointed him as imperial warden in Amersfoort in 1538.Vaterl√§ndisches Archiv des historischen Vereins f√ºr Niedersachsen, Luneburg 1837: ‚ÄûNachrichten von der adlichen Familie von Diepholt in Ostfriesland‚Äú, pp. 12 -14.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, pp. 18-19. He was buried in Emden around 1540. Otto's eldest son, Coenraat van Diepholt (died 1572), married Fransken van IJsselstein, daughter of Christoffel van IJsselstein and the illegitimate niece of Floris van Egmont, Count of Buren. He was Marshal of the Nether- Bishopric (Nedersticht) of Utrecht and Montfoort and acted as castellan of Abcoude. Coenraat's children, Floris and Francisca, left progeny in the Netherlands and Germany.Rootenberg, Francesco Uys, Het geslacht Van Diepholt in het Sticht en Westfalen en hun verwantschap aan de graven van Buren, Kaapstad 2015, pp. 12-23, 54-59. Jost von Diepholt (died after 1573), Otto's second son, married Almuth Ukena, whose father was a bastard son of Count Uko Cirksena of East-Frisia (brother of Edzard I). This couple became the ancestors of the noble Von Diepholt family of East-Frisia.Vaterl√§ndisches Archiv des historischen Vereins f√ºr Niedersachsen, Luneburg 1837: ‚ÄûNachrichten von der adlichen Familie von Diepholt in Ostfriesland‚Äú, p. 14.

The system was developed from the mid-1990s. In addition to third party usage for U.S. Army and Marines Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) fleet upgrades, TAK-4 independent suspension system is fitted by Oshkosh to a variety of its military vehicles and by its business unit, Oshkosh Airport Products, to its Striker Airport Rescue vehicle and Pierce Manufacturing to its Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) trucks and other appliances. Development In 1999 Oshkosh was awarded a United States Air Force (USAF) contract to supply P23 ARFF trucks. These, and the earlier P23 supplied to the Air Force between 1994 and 1996 by Teledyne and Emergency-One (E-One) were fitted with independent suspension designed by Timoney Technology of Ireland. The success of the P23, and subsequent interest in an independent suspension solution for US Army and Marines 5-ton truck upgrade projects led to Oshkosh (and the then Rockwell) approaching Timoney with regard to a licence arrangement for the suspension. Following discussions with both, Timoney opted to enter into a licence arrangement with Rockwell (now Meritor). Oshkosh then developed two, possibly three independent suspension systems, including the set-up that came to be marketed as TAK-4 independent suspension system. The latest TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system has been fitted to Oshkosh's L-ATV, this selected to meet the US Army and Marines JLTV requirement. The first use of TAK-4 independent suspension system was on an M939 5-ton truck as part of the Marines‚Äô plan to upgrade its M939 fleet. The upgrade approach was ultimately abandoned, this replaced by a new-build approach for which the Oshkosh Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR) was selected. The first production contract for the MTVR was awarded in February 1999 and the type remains in production for the US Marines. The MTVR is fitted with TAK-4 independent suspension system independent suspension and was the first mass-produced military truck with fully independent suspension. Oshkosh has since fitted TAK-4 independent suspension system to its Palletized Load System (PLS) trucks, Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR) trucks and M-ATVs (MRAP ‚Äì All-Terrain Vehicle), and the system has been retro-fitted to US Army/Marines General Dynamics/Force Protection Cougar MRAPs, BAE Systems‚Äô RG-31 and RG-33 MRAPs. Oshkosh business units Pierce Manufacturing and Oshkosh Airport Products fit TAK-4 independent suspension system systems to a large amount of its fire trucks. Most recently the latest TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system has been fitted to Oshkosh's L-ATV (Light Combat Tactical ‚Äì All-Terrain Vehicle), this selected to meet the US Army and Marines JLTV (Joint Light Tactical Vehicle) requirement. Oshkosh remains current market leader for independent suspension systems above the 5000 kg threshold for where commercial systems are often used, and excluding Striker and Pierce products has equipped in the region of 30,000 military vehicles with the TAK-4 independent suspension system set-up. This figure will increase as JLTV production ramps up. To date the TAK-4 independent suspension system has accrued in excess of 1,000,000 actual durability test miles, most of these in extreme conditions. Description The Oshkosh TAK-4 (and TAK-4i) suspension is known as double wishbone independent suspension. This is an independent suspension design using two wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each arm has two mounting points to the subframe and one joint at the knuckle, and in the case of TAK-4 independent suspension system these arms are of unequal length. The shock absorber and spring mount to the lower arm to control vertical movement. The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as ‚Äòdouble A-arm,‚Äô though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage. The complete TAK-4 independent suspension system set-up also includes a subframe which contains the axle differential, half shafts, and wheel ends with steering attachments and brakes. TAK-4 independent suspension system accepts various spring mediums, but the vast majority of systems supplied by Oshkosh to date have been fitted with coil springs. Exceptions are the rear axles on the LVSR and the wrecker variant of the MTVR which are hydro- pneumatic struts with Hendrickson components. The original TAK-4 independent suspension system coil spring set-up as fitted to MTVR, LVSR and PLS A1 (front axles), M-ATV and upgraded MRAPs offers around 16-inches of vertical wheel travel and for MTVR, LVSR and PLS-A1, and has an off-road gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 12,020 kg. The slighter lighter-capacity version fitted to the M-ATV has an off-road GVWR of 10,433 kg. The light version offered as a potential HMMWV upgrade has a GVWR of 10,000 kg and offers around 14-inches of vertical wheel travel. In all cases the operating profile of the system is 70% off-road, 30% on-road. The new Oshkosh TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension provides 20-inches of wheel travel, and again a 70% off-road, 30% on-road operating profile. TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension is fitted to Oshkosh's JLTV/L-ATV. TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension is an ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô independent suspension, providing variable ride height through gas springs. To promote TAK-4i intelligent independent suspension system suspension, Oshkosh has stated the following: ‚ÄúIn fact, Independent testing proves that the Oshkosh L-ATV provides the same ride quality at speeds 70 percent faster than today‚Äôs industry gold standard for off-road mobility, the Oshkosh MRAP All- Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV).‚Äù TAK-4 Applications (coil springs unless stated) * M939 5-ton: Development for potential upgrade which evolved into MTVR procurement * Oshkosh Medium Tactical Vehicle Replacement (MTVR): 11,350 (est.)

The Hall of Guru or Guru Hall (), also known as the Founder's Hall, is the most important annex halls in Chinese Buddhist temples for enshrining masters of various Buddhism schools. It is encountered throughout East Asia, including in some Japanese Buddhist Kaisandos (). The Hall of Guru is generally situated to the west of the Mahavira Hall. Chan Buddhist temples usually have the Hall of Guru, which is followed by other schools' temples. Therefore three statues are always enshrined in the Guru Hall, namely the founder of the school, the senior monk who make significant contributions to the establishment of the school and the builder of the temple. Generally the Guru Hall in Chan Buddhism temples has Bodhidharma enshrined in the middle, the 6th Master Huineng's (638-713) statue on the left and Master Baizhang Huaihai's (720-814) statue on the right. Patriarch Bodhidharma and Damo () for short, from south of ancient India, was the original ancestor of Chan Buddhism. The 6th Master Dajian Huineng was the actual founder of Chan Buddhism. After him, the Chan Buddhism in ancient China was almost changed and had far-reaching influence on Chinese traditional culture. Baizhang Huaihai was the third generation disciple of Huineng and his main achievements included: applying Chan Buddhism into practice, creating a set of regulations for Chan Buddhist temples and contributing to the steady development of Chan Buddhism.

It is primarily made up of magistrates, but is sometimes represented by other persons such as police officials. Its magistrates can be referred to as \\"standing\\" magistrates, as opposed to magistrats du si√®ge (magistrates of the seat). Its closest equivalent in some English-speaking countries is the (office of the) director of public prosecutionsDictionnaire fran√ßais-anglais Larousse and the attorney general in others. The term minist√®re public translates literally as \\"public ministry\\" and that institution can exercise a public action (action publique) in penal infractions that cause a disturbance of the ordre public, and can also initiate prosecutions or non-prosecutions. It can intervene in all jurisdictions of the judiciary, but has never really exercised the same role in the administrative areas, except for financial venues (juridictions financi√®res).  Terminology  In France, the minist√®re public (in the person of an Attorney-general, a procureur de la R√©publique or one of his substituts or representatives) is designated as \\"le parquet\\" in legal jargon. The word parquet itself may have stemmed from the Old French, where it meant a \\"small park or enclosure\\". The term \\"parquet\\" goes back to the medieval expression \\"parquet des Gens du Roi\\". The origin of this use and meaning of the word is not known with certainty, but the most probable hypothesis is that these magistrates were separated from the magistrates du si√®ge in a sort of \\"park\\". The location of the minist√®re public has been called the \\"parquet\\" because in the Great Chamber (la Grand-Chambre) of Paris the enclosure delimited on three sides by the seats of judges and on the fourth by a barre or handrail, this heart of the room, a closed and dedicated space,(sacr√©), a small parc or parquet, that the people of the king (les gens du roi) crossed to take their places and where the gens d'armes, gendarmes, came forward to relate the findings of their investigations, to erect (en dresser) the proc√®s-verbal.see the article \\"PALAIS DE JUSTICE\\" by Vincent Lamanda, in the Dictionnaire de l'Ancien R√©gime The name \\"standing magistracy\\" (\\"magistrature debout\\"), comes from the fact that minist√®re public magistrates formerly stood to speak, notably when prenant les r√©quisitions, asking for a sentence, unlike the magistrats du si√®ge, magistrates of the seat, who remained seated for the entire hearing.  History  The minist√®re public first appears as a concept at the end of the 18th century, when the kings of France caused their interests to be defended by procureurs, or prosecutors, who little by little put themselves exclusively at the service of the kings. The parquet modeled itself little by little with procureurs, prosecutors, avocats, lawyers and substituts, designations which remain in contemporary French justice.Philippe Sueur, Histoire du droit public fran√ßais (XVe ‚Äë XVIIIe si√®cles), 2e √©d., 1994 Prior to the French Revolution, the minist√®re public was embodied by officers called the Gens du roi (King's men), so that the Attorney-General of the king was the key role of the parlements of the Ancien R√©gime. The question of whether to keep the minist√®re public arose at the time of the Revolution, but this was resolved in the affirmative by the law of the 16th and 24 August 1790, notably in article 8 of title II. The First Republic reprised the idea as the accusateur public, or public accuser. Until 1970, jurisdictions existed which had a parquet, in general the penal jurisdictions and the civil common law jurisdictions, and jurisdictions with no parquet existed as well, the juridictions d'exception non r√©pressives such as the council de prud'hommes for example. Article 3 of law no 70-613, the law of the 10th of July 1970, authorised the prosecutor of the Republic to exercise public action before all first degree jurisdictions The drive to install a minist√®re public before administrative jurisdictions other than the Cour des comptes was translated by the ordinances of February 2 and March 12, 1831, which created the function of \\"government commissioner\\" before the Conseil d'√âtat. Not until 1862 were government commissioners introduced to les conseils de pr√©fecture. Given that administrative justice works differently, the absence of hierarchy between the commissioners and a more rapid passage from the function of ¬´ commissaire du gouvernement ¬ª to that of judge, these persons never really exercised the role d'un minist√®re public, except in comparison to a public minister (minist√®re public) of the Cour de cassation The government rebaptized \\"rapporteurs publics\\" in 2009.  In the judiciary  = Principles of organisation =  Hierarchy   Indivisibility of the parquet  One of the specifics of the parquet is that it is indivisible: each member represents the whole and the members are thus interchangeables. Any action by a member commits the entire parquet. In a trial, the magistrates of the parquet may mutually replace one another without stopping the proceedings, which is forbidden to the magistrates du si√®ge results in their case of nullity of the judgment.  Non-responsibility of the parquet  Another specific is the non-responsibility of the parquet; a magistrate of the parquet is responsible only for his own mistakes but cannot be assigned court costs as another plaintiff might after losing a trial. He cannot be prosecuted for either injury or defamation caused by what he says in a hearing. Personal faults tied to public service can on the other hand be prosecuted by virtue of the State's power of recourse, but only in front of the civil chamber of the Cour de cassation. = Organisation and personnel = The magistrates who compose it are the same as those of the si√®ge (chair). Generally a magistrate, in the course of his career, will carry out the functions of the chair as well as of the parquet. {style=\\"margin-bottom: 10px;\\" class=\\"wikitable centre\\" width=\\"80%\\" !

(This parquet cannot exercise any action publique. It has a role similar to that of the rapporteur public before the Conseil d'√âtat or Council of State); * Special case: \\"When the infractions concern the public roadways, the functions of the minist√®re public of a police tribunal may be filled by the departmental director of equipment or the agent designated by him to supplement him\\".Code of the road, art. This article is still in effect but the departmental directorates have been replaced by the interdepartmental directors of roads (directions interd√©partementales des routes). * before military tribunals in time of war (tribunal territorial des forces arm√©es et tribunal militaire aux arm√©es), the minist√®re public role falls to a \\"government commissioner\\". = Minist√®re public's role = The role of the minist√®re public, which is to defend the interests of society, the public order and the application of the law, is exercised in three areas: an action publique before a penal jurisdiction, an intervention before a civil jurisdiction, and the attributions administratives.  Exercise of public action in penal matters  He represents the interests of society and to do so he exercises an action publique (in other words prosecution as the plaintiff, intervening in the trial as a principal party). He can act both in the instruction and the judgment phases. The services of the police judiciaire (PJ), or judicial police, are at the disposal of the minist√®re public for seeking out infractions, which allows him to decide whether or not to set off the action publique.  In the administrative order  = Before financial juridisctions = = Before administrative jurisdictions = In common law administrative jurisdictions (i.e. as opposed to specialised administrative jurisdictions), commissaires du gouvernement (government commissioners) existed, and were loosely related to the judiciary's minist√®re public, albeit their functions were closer to giving a general opinion on legal matters pertaining a case rather than actively defending the interests of society of the government, despite their name. Their transformation into rapporteurs publics in 2009 confirmed that they were not of the same nature as the minist√®re public. Furthermore, Rapporteurs public has been confirmed to be fully independent and impartial in their functions. Thus, contrary to the minist√®re public, they are not subordinated to the minister of justice, and act more as advisors on the interpretation that should be given to the law rather than as agents of the government's judicial policy.  Before the tribunal des conflits  Article 6 of the law of February 4, 1850 bearing on the organisation of the tribunal des conflits provides that the functions of the minist√®re public will be filled by two commissioners of the government chosen every year by the President of the Republic, one from among the ma√Ætres des requ√™tes on the State Council (Conseil d'√âtat), the other from the parquet of the Cour de cassation. Le tribunal ne peut statuer qu'apr√®s avoir entendu les conclusions du commissaire du gouvernement (art. 4 de la loi). Si le rapporteur appartient au Conseil d'√âtat, alors le commissaire du gouvernement doit √™tre un magistrat de la Cour de cassation, et r√©ciproquement (art. 7 de la loi).  Non-independence of the parquet and condemnation of France  The parquet is not considered an independent judicial authority in the meaning of article 5 of the Convention de Sauvegarde des Droits de l‚ÄôHomme et des Libert√©s Fondamentales.Article de Eolas. The European court for the rights of man condemned France in November 2010 for having conferred on it jurisdictional functions.Arr√™t Moulin contre France (no&37104/06). In 2013 the law was again modified, eliminating the oral instructions transmitted par the Chancellerie to prosecutors. At the same time the European Court of Human Rights confirmed in a new verdict on June 27, 2013, Vassis et al vs France,Arr√™t Vassis c. that the French parquet cannot be considered a judicial authority in the sense of article 5¬ß3 of the Convention.¬´ La France condamn√©e par la CEDH √† une r√©forme constitutionnelle ¬ª sur le site du Syndicat de la magistrature  See also   * Opportunit√© des poursuites * Procureur g√©n√©ral *  Notes and references   External links  * Code de proc√©dure p√©nale, livre Ier, titre Ier, chapitre II ¬´ Du minist√®re public ¬ª, article 31 * Code de proc√©dure civile (France), Titre XIII, Le minist√®re public *[Ier]: premier ","title":"Minist√®re public (France)"},{"id":"51308936","text":"Simon Phillips, 2013 Simon Phillips (born 1958) is a New Zealand-Australian director of theatre, musicals and opera.

Among the accused were the editors of the weekly magazine Die Weltb√ºhne and Carl von Ossietzky, plus the journalist Walter Kreiser. They were accused of treason and divulging military secrets. In November 1931, they were condemned by the 4. senat of the Reichsgericht in Leipzig to 18 months of imprisonment. History =Treaty of Versailles= After the First World War the German Empire had to agree to a strong reduction of its military forces due to the Treaty of Versailles. Despite this signature the government and the Reichswehr tried systematically to undermine the provisions of the treaty. Pacifist and anti-militarist circles in the Weimar Republic saw therefore on the behavior of the army a threat to the foreign policy consolidation of the German Reich and to inner peace. =Military Critical Press= Those media who were drawing attention to the grievances, were subjected to severe repression. However, the Treaty of Versailles did not only limit the strength of the army. It prohibited in article 198 also expressly the set up of an own air force. Memorial plate Berlin-Charlottenburg Wundtstr 65 house of the redaction 1921-1927 Against the described background, it is hardly surprising that in the Weltb√ºhne under the pseudonym Heinz Hunter on March 12, 1929 published article \\"Windiges aus der deutschen Luftfahrt\\" arouse the displeasure of the army. In pacifist circles it was obvious that the army was apparently bypassing the Treaty of Versailles and ran to the clandestine construction of an air force. The senior prosecutor launched an investigation for breach of the treason paragraphs of Penal Code and contrary to Clause 1, paragraph 2 of the Act against disclosure of military secrets (the so-called espionage Act of 3 June 1914 (Reichsgesetzblatt), 195). Method On August 1, 1929, finally, a criminal complaint was lodged. During the investigation, the editorial offices of the Weltb√ºhne and the apartment of Ossietzky were searched. In August 1929 Ossietzky was also questioned about the case. On March 30, 1931, two years after the article had appeared, the indictment was made. Legal actors On the part of the prosecutor's office and the Supreme Court the Weltb√ºhne had to do with lawyers who had already gained relevant awareness. Attorney Paul Jorns, was affected with the investigations of the murders of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg and had there covered tracks.Siehe: Ingo M√ºller: \\"Der ber√ºhmte Fall Ossietzky vom Jahr 1930 k√∂nnte sich jederzeit wiederholen ‚Ä¶\\" In: Hans-Ernst B√∂tcher (Hrsg.): Recht Justiz Kritik, Festschrift f√ºr Richard Schmid. Nomos, Baden-Baden 1985, S. 297‚Äì326, hier p. 307. The head Alexander Baumgarten, had led in autumn 1930 the Ulm Reichswehrprozess where Adolf Hitler had given his Legalit√§tserkl√§rungbut also announced that after the beginning of his government heads will roll.Nach dem Republikschutzgesetz w√§re dies strafbar gewesen. Vergleiche: Ingo M√ºller, S. 305. The defense of the accused took over the renowned lawyers Max Alsberg, Kurt Rosenfeld, Alfred Apfel and Rudolf Olden. Negotiation According to the German laws, it was not allowed to the Weltb√ºhne to report detailed about the process. Negotiations were immediately postponed because no representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had appeared. The hearing in camera finally took place on 17 and 19 November 1931. As witnesses for the prosecution acted Major Himer from the Ministry of the Reichswehr and Permanent Secretary Wegerdt from the Ministry of Transport. They confirmed that the information from the article was true and therefore should have been kept secret in the interests of defense. Carl von Ossietzky before Berlin-Tegel prison, from the left: Kurt Grossmann, Rudolf Olden, Carl von Ossietzky, Alfred Apfel, Kurt Rosenfeld The court rejected all 19 defense witnesses. Judgment The trial ended on 23 November with the conviction of the two accused for \\"crimes against the ¬ß 1 paragraph 2 of the law on disclosure of military secrets from June 3, 1914\\". The sentence was 18 months of imprisonment. In its reasoning, the court argued that the defendants after the specifying of the expert had really disseminated secret informations. Political reactions At the sentencing reacted von Ossietzky with sarcasm. \\"One and a half years of imprisonment? It is not so bad, because it is not far to the freedom in Germany here. The differences between incarcerated and non-incarcerated fade gradually\\". *Quote: I know that every journalist who is critically engaged in the Reichswehr, has to expect a treason process; ‚Ä¶ nevertheless, this time was made for a delightful variety: We left the room not as traitors but as spies.Der Weltb√ºhnen-Proze√ü. In: Die Weltb√ºhne. 1. Dezember 1931, S. 803. *Quote: The Reichsgericht has stamped me precautionary in a most unpleasant way. Treason and the treason of military secrets that is a very diffaming etikette, which is hard to live with.Rechenschaft. In: Die Weltb√ºhne. 10. Mai 1932, S. 691. The verdict aroused at home and abroad for several reasons attention. The Weltb√ºhne published in the editions of 1 December and 15 December 1931 numerous foreign press on the process. In Germany, many democratic politicians were shocked. Reichstag President Paul L√∂be wrote: \\"I have rarely an opinion as such a bust felt not only in legal but also in political terms, as this.\\" Various organizations attempted to prevent Ossietzky actually had to play the sentence after the verdict. Ossietzky went on May 10, 1932 to prison Berlin-Tegel. His lawyers accompanied him. Quote:... I do not bow to the wrapped in red velvet majesty of the Supreme Court but remain as a passenger of a Prussian prison a vibrant demonstration against a highly-instance verdict, that appears politically tendentious in the matter and ample askew as legal work |.Rechenschaft. In: Die Weltb√ºhne. 10. Mai 1932, S. 690. Due to a Christmas amnesty for political prisoners Ossietzky was released early on December 22, 1932 after 227 days in prison. = Legal assessment= The process was certainly one of the sharpest attacks from Reichswehr and Justice against the critical press in the Weimar Republic. Moreover, it had become clear abroad that Germany did not intend to observe obviously important points of the Treaty of Versailles. Ossietzky conceded after his conviction that the Republic had at least safeguarded \\"the decorum of the legal process\\". During the so-called Spiegel scandal parallels were drawn from the press to the Weltb√ºhne process. So published BGH - Senate President Heinrich Jagusch under the pseudonym \\"Judex\\" the highly acclaimed article \\"Is there a risk of new Ossietzky case?\\" . Retrial In the 1980s, German lawyers attempted to achieve a retrial. Thus the judgment of 1931 should be revised. Rosalinde von Ossietzky-Palm, the only child of Carl von Ossietzky initiated as eligible on March 1, 1990 at the Berlin Supreme Court, the proceedings. The Court of Appeal declared a retrial inadmissible. The Federal Court then declined to appeal against the decision of the Appeal Court.

It was worked by skilled miners from Cornwall and by less skilled Brazilian labourers and slaves. Machinery powered by a water wheel and a steam engine was used to pump out the mine, operate the lifts, and operate the grinding mills where the gold was separated from the ore. The mine was closed when the gold ran out, but was later reopened as an iron ore mine. Recently the iron mine was also closed. Etymology The origins of the name \\"Gongo Soco\\" are obscure. One version is that when there was a theft in the mine a gong was sounded, but nobody listened. Another is that a slave from the Congo was found squatting (\\"soco\\") while burying a gold deposit. Gold mine A Bitencourt prospector found gold in a stream that cuts through the region in 1745. The land was later inherited by Jo√£o Baptista Ferreira de Souza Coutinho, Baron of Catas Altas. He sold it to the Imperial Brazilian Mining Association, based in Cornwall, England, for ¬£79,000 in 1825. The company converted the alluvial gold extraction operation into mechanised underground mining and gold extraction. From 1826 to 1856 the mine produced over of gold. A German visitor, Ernst Hasenclever, visited the mine in 1839, when Gongo Soco was the largest gold mine in Brazil. The mine had a smithy where all the tools and instruments need for the mine were made, and a large 3-story warehouse holding provisions that also served as housing for the English miners. There was a hospital, which looking like a barracks to Hasenclever. The hospital building was carefully planned, with central corridors, large rooms with two windows each and up to eight beds, and a sophisticated ventilation system to avoid humidity in the basement. A steam engine above the mine shaft turned a double wheel that drove a long chain to haul up containers of ore and lower down logs. The main corridors were about high and contained iron rails on which wagons were pushed for about . Loads of gravel extracted from the side galleries using drills and sledgehammers were hoisted by a simple winch and transported by wagon to a grinding mill. One black slave could easily push two wagons. The deposits at Gongo Soco were in weak rock formations, so large tree trunks from a forest away were needed to prop up the gallery ceilings. The mine had a large drainage pump driven by a water wheel, which also drove the grinding mills. The water was pumped up , and was used to power a sawmill lower down the slope. The mine had nine grinding mills, each with 12‚Äì24 wooden hammers with iron heads weighing . The gravel from the mine was placed in an iron container, then pounded into dust by the hammers, which were driven by a wooden wheel. The dust was washed from the container by a fast current of water running through a cloth-lined trough. The heavy gold fell into the cloth, while lighter elements were washed out at the end. The cloth was then washed to remove the gold dust. The work continued day and night. In 1839 a record of of gold was extracted. However, the machinery was not powerful enough to reach the deeper veins. Only were produced in 1856, and the mine was closed. Later gold extraction was replaced by iron mining. Gravestone of Anne, wife of William Jeffree, who died in 1841 aged 38 Workers The company hired skilled miners from Cornwall and used Brazilians and slaves for unskilled work. The climate was considered healthy, with temperatures from . At first the mine had a superintendent, two mine captains and 31 miners and artisans. In 1839 the mine director received an annual salary of ¬£3,500. Under him there were four captains, eight officers and eighty British miners who were assisted by 650 slaves owned by the Imperial Brazilian Mining Association. Each English miner received a yearly wage of ¬£80, paid in monthly instalments. Many of the Cornish workers brought their families with them, encouraged to do so by the mine captain William Jory Henwood. They were on 3‚Äì5 year contracts, so there was constant contact with Cornish mining communities such as Gwennap and Redruth through miners travelling to and from Brazil. Hasenclever said a \\"black inspector\\" (Negerinspektor) was responsible for the slaves, including their food, clothing, housing and discipline. Women slaves were employed above ground, mainly in washing the gold-bearing sand. Although Hasenclever wrote that Gongo Soco had 650 slaves in 1839, probably not all the black workers were slaves as he thought. There would have been free blacks working with the slaves, doing the same work but for pay. Another source gives the total in 1838 as 413 slaves, 148 Europeans and 190 Brazilians, totalling 751 people. Yet another source estimates that in 1840 there were 500 slaves, 200 Brazilian free workers and 51 Europeans. A doctor and a priest served all the workers, including slaves. Village The village in 1839 A village grew up about from the mine in the wooded valley of the Gongo Soco River. The single-story buildings surrounded a church among banana trees. The former home of the Baron of Catas Altas was occupied by the superintendents of the mine. The Casa Grande housed the director and first commissioner, and their families, and also held the mine's administrative and accounting offices. The Casa Grande was a large building where the company commissioner would hold parties on Saturday evenings. Concerts and dances were also arranged at the Casa Grande. The slaves lived apart from the Cornish to avoid contact and friction. Henwood opened a school for the children of the slaves. A company store sold a range of household goods. There was a market every Saturday where the miners could buy chickens, eggs, fruit and vegetables. Some miners hired a local woman as a cook. The mine had a good library. There was a Catholic church for the slaves and Brazilians, and an Anglican church for the Protestants. Many of the Cornish were Wesleyan Methodists, and used the fields or their houses for prayer and study meetings. Often they grew flowers and vegetables in their gardens from seeds brought from Cornwall. After the mine closed in 1856 some of the Cornish miners went back to Cornwall while some found work in other Brazilian mines such as those operated by the Saint John d'El Rey Mining Company. Ruins Ruins of the Casa Grande There are two sets of ruins from the old Gongo Soco mine. Sector 1 contains the mine itself and its industrial structures. Sector 2, some distance away, holds the housing and infrastructure of the former village. According to the 1931 census the village had 30 stone houses along a road. It included the Cemit√©rio dos Ingleses, where the British workers were buried, and where ten tombstones have been found with English inscriptions. There are traces of a hospital and two churches, one Catholic and the other Anglican. It has been conjectured that the house of the Baron of Catas Altas covered , assuming it was one story high. Near Sector 1 there is a chimney high and wide. Along the road to the right there is a stone wall almost long ending in an arched gateway, presumably erected to mark the visits of emperors Pedro I in 1831 and Pedro II in 1881. The ruined arch is covered by a fig tree. To the left is what the traveller Richard Francis Burton says would have been a dressing room. Iron mine Gongo Soco was abandoned until it was acquired in 1986 by Minera√ß√£o Socoimex, which maintained the remains of the former gold mine. On 11 May 2000 CVRD (Vale) acquired full control of Socoimex, which was extracting and selling iron ore from the Gongo S√¥co Mine. The mine had proven reserves of about 75 million tons of high grade hematite, and could produce about 7 million tons annually. In 2011 Vale said it could extend operations at the mine for a few more years, but was preparing to complete the project, with the transfer of 350 employees to other units.

The Regimental Headquarters is at Lyster Barracks in ƒ¶al Far. Lyster Barracks was a former Royal Navy and Royal Air Force barracks and originally named after Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Lumley St George Lyster. Admiral Lyster commanded the Fleet Air Arm force that protected the Operation Pedestal convoy force to Malta during World War 2. The current barracks site includes some of the original British military architecture and four of the accommodation blocks are named after famous Royal Navy aircraft carriers, some of whom were frequent visitors to Malta; i.e. Glorious, Courageous, Eagle and Hermes The 1st Regiment is task organised into a Headquarters Company, three Infantry Companies and an Air Defence and Support Company. It is the AFM‚Äôs main land manoeuvre unit. Its tasks are based on public duties, security, crisis management operations and peacekeeping missions.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/mt-afm.htm History The 1st Regiment's predecessor The Royal Malta Artillery was set up on 15 March 1889, with the specific aim of manning the guns around the Grand Harbour, which apart from being the point of connection with the rest of the world, was also important as a base for the Royal Navy. In time, more roles were created to cater for the great advances in warfare, especially during World War I, so that by the beginning of World War II the R.M.A consisted of 4 Regiments. There was also the Dockyard Defence Battery, composed of workers at the Admiralty Dockyard who alternated between manning their guns and working at their trade. In 1970 the 1 Regiment of the Royal Malta Artillery was renamed as 1 Regiment, AFM. Initially, this continued their artillery role, with 2 Regiment formed as an engineers unit. In 1980, 1 Regiment became a mixed unit which included infantry, light army aviation and maritime responsibilities The light anti-aircraft artillery element was transferred to the 2 Regiment. In 1992, there was a major re-organisation, which led to the formation of 3 Regiment, which remains predominantly reflected in its structure till today.

Table Cape is a more or less circular volcanic plug with a flat top, its northern and eastern faces rise steeply from Bass Strait to a height of approximately above sea level. It was named by British navigator, Matthew Flinders, as he and George Bass circumnavigated Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) in 1798 upon the Norfolk. Flinders also progressively named the nearby Circular Head, Three Hummock and Hunter Islands. Table Cape's top and surrounding areas are composed of fertile basalt soils and are heavily cultivated, the area is renowned for the annual flowering of tulips during spring and accompanying tulip festival. The 2011 census determined a population of 324 for the state suburb of Flowerdale, which the locality of Table Cape forms part of. Landscape and conservation Whilst the top of Table Cape and surrounding district is heavily utilised for agriculture, the steep and rocky ocean-facing embankments remain largely undisturbed from human activity and are covered in dense scrubland. The 1.26 km2 Table Cape Conservation Area (IUCN IV) extends along the shoreline from Boat Harbour Beach to the Table Cape State Reserve (IUCN III) before continuing along to Freestone Cove near Fossil Bluff. Beddomeia capensis is an endangered freshwater snail known only to occur along four small streams on Table Cape, and a tributary of Big Creek near Calder. However, recent surveys have only been able to identify the species at two unnamed streams near the Table Cape Lighthouse, with the total length of occupied stream less than . Population declines are due to habitat degradation from agricultural land usage and competition from other introduced hydrobiid snails. =Tommeginer Aboriginal clan= The territory of the Tommeginer clan of Aboriginal Tasmanians is located around the Table Cape region. The tribe most likely built the stone tidal fish traps that remain evident at nearby Freestone Cove. Table Cape Lighthouse Table Cape Lighthouse is a Tasmanian heritage-listed lighthouse situated on the 120 hectare Table Cape State Reserve. It has been open for public tours since 2010. After the wrecks of the Emma Prescott in 1867 and the schooner Orson in 1884, a lighthouse was commissioned to be constructed on Table Cape to aide navigation into the port of Wynyard on the Inglis River. Table Cape Lighthouse was designed by Huckson and Hutchinson of Hobart, the light apparatus was sourced from the Chance Brothers of England and was constructed by a local builder, John Luck. The project suffered from delays due to poor quality roads leading up to the construction site on Table Cape, and bricks of insufficient quality sourced from the specially-constructed kiln in the nearby town of Burnie, instead, bricks had to be imported interstate from Victoria. The lighthouse was first lit up on 1 August 1888, it stands about high and has a diameter of at the base. Seventeen days after the official opening, the head lighthouse keeper's 14-month-old son died from illness. The undertaker, who had travelled up to the lighthouse with a coffin for the child, encouraged the family to perform the burial nearby due to the appalling weather conditions at the time. The small gravesite remains to be found nearby today. Originally powered by oil, Table Cape Lighthouse was converted to automatic acetylene operation in 1920. In 1923, the lightkeepers were withdrawn from manning the tower, and after several years of deterioration, the nearby keepers' cottages were demolished in 1926. In 1979, mains electricity was connected and an electric beacon with standby batteries was installed, the maximum nominal range of the 100W halogen lamp is approximately .

National School Boards Assoc, 2000. Print. According to the National School Boards Association, ECIA said little of classroom instruction and provided little incentives to experiment or innovate their practice. Part of the problem was that EICA was passed very quickly and its development was based on little legislative history. By 1983, the influential A Nation at Risk report moved the debate around ECIA away from fiscal compliance and toward program excellence school improvement, and student achievement. The subsequent Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Act of 1988 had this missing emphasis, by formally encouraging ‚Äúprogram improvement‚Äù from the states. Federal funding for education was cut by over $1 billion. Title I, which was renamed Chapter I under ECIA, allocated $3.034 billion in FY 1982 from the federal government‚Äôs budget to support education. Most of these funds were distributed via formula grants to local education agencies; state educational agencies only received a small amount of funding. Chapter II funds amounted to $456 million in FY 1982 and were paid out to state education agencies depending on their school-age populations. 80 percent of Chapter II funds were then distributed to local educational agencies on the basis of three major areas: basic skills development, educational improvement and support services, and special projects. The remaining 20 percent of Chapter II funds were allocated by the state to cover expenditures related to curriculum development, training, planning, technical assistance, administration, monitoring, and enforcement activities. Finally, Chapter III specified the Secretary of Education‚Äôs power to issue regulations.

Description and history The Cilley Covered Bridge stands in a rural area about south of the central village of Tunbridge. It carries Howe Lane, a side loop off Vermont Route 110, across the First Branch White River. It is a single-span Kingspost truss structure, long and wide, with a road bed wide (one lane). The bridge is set on abutments of stone, one of which has been faced in concrete, and is covered in vertical board siding and a metal roof. The south side of the bridge has two square window holes, which improve visibility due to a sharp turn in the road at one end. The trusses are set at a skew, giving the bridge the shape of a parallelogram. The portals are square, and the exterior sheathing extends around to the ends of the trusses on the interior. with The bridge was built in 1883, and has been little altered since then. It is one of six bridges in a stretch of the First Branch White River, representing one of the highest concentrations of covered bridges in the state.

Brico, who was the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra (1938), debuted the orchestra to a full auditorium. The premiere performance received a telegram from composer Jean Sibelius wishing good luck. In 1968, the name was changed to the Brico Symphony. Brico remained as music director until 1984. Russian-American conductor Julius Glaihengauz became DPO's second music director. A graduate of the Moscow Conservatory, Glaihengauz led the orchestra for 11 seasons under its new name, Centennial Philharmonic. An interim director, Kirk Smith, led the orchestra for one season following Glaihengauz's departure. In 1999, Dr. Horst Buchholz became the third music director, and in 2004, the Centennial Philharmonic Orchestra became the Denver Philharmonic Orchestra. Buchholz, who was a Professor of Music at the University of Denver, served as music director and conductor until 2009.

Wegner is a professor in the Department of English and the Marston- Milbauer Eminent Scholar in English at the University of Florida.  Career  Phillip E. Wegner earned his Bachelor of Arts in Honors English, summa cum laude, at California State University, Northridge in 1986. He earned his PhD from the Literature Program at Duke University in 1993, where he studied under the preeminent Marxist critic Fredric Jameson. He began working as a professor of English at the University of Florida in 1994 and was appointed the Marston- Milbauer Eminent Scholar Professorship in 2012. From 2009-2012 he served as the graduate program coordinator. He was awarded the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Teacher of the Year award in 1996 and 2000. Professor Wegner has published five books and numerous articles on utopian fiction, contemporary literature, film, cultural studies, Marxism, and science fiction.  Academic interests  Wegner's scholarship is often centered on questions of periodization, particularly in relation to the scholarship of Fredric Jameson, who Wegner has called \\"the most significant contemporary theorist of periodization.\\" For example, his book Life Between Two Deaths examines the \\"specific cultural period\\" of the 1990s, which Wegner argues stretches from the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to September 11, 2001. Wegner has also written extensively about utopia. In his first book, Imaginary Communities, Wegner argues that the history of the utopian genre is \\"inseparable from a history of modernity in which the works comprising this important genre play such a significant role.\\" In Shockwaves of Possibility, Wegner makes a similar argument about utopia and the genre of science fiction, arguing that \\"Utopianism is not simply one among a range of possible themes or motifs in modern science fiction... Rather, Utopianism is fundamental to the very narrative dynamic of this vital modern practice.\\" In addition to his academic research on Utopia, Wegner served as President of the Society for Utopian Studies from 2010‚Äì2014.

She is best known for her adaptations of Indian epic poetry. She started writing and illustrating her first book The Mahabharatha - A Child‚Äôs View at the age of eight. The book then went on to be translated in seven languages and sold 50,000 copies worldwide. Her second book ‚Äì Sita‚Äôs Ramayana ‚Äì was on the New York Times Bestseller list for Graphic Novels for two weeks in 2011. Career Arni's first book, The Mahabharata: A Child's View, was published in 1996, when she was 11 years old. It was translated into several European languages, and won the Elsa Morante Literary Award from the Department of Culture of Campania, Italy, among other accoladates. As an adult, she has written two books based on the Ramayana. The first, Sita's Ramayana, is a graphic novel developed in collaboration with Patua artist Moyna Chitrakar. Her second Ramayana adaptation is The Missing Queen, a Speculative fiction mythological thriller. It was published by Penguin/Zubaan in 2013. The Prince, her latest book, is the culmination of a five-year journey spent studying Ilango Adigal's Silappatikaram.It was the year 2014 and the Nirbhaya case had taken centre- stage, unleashing a wave of wrath from women across the country. Arni watched this unfold, disturbed by the tragedy of what had taken place and staggered by the collective fury. It led to what she calls an obsession with Silappatikaram, the Sangam period epic, a story of love, betrayal, grief and above all, wrath. Retellings, she feels, are important for a culture to evolve. ‚ÄúEach generation is different, and for a myth, story, or an epic to resonate with that generation, it must be told in a way that relates with that generation's experience, in order to touch them, and for that story to remain part of our cultural psyche. She has been a regular columnist for The Bangalore Mirror and The Hindu. Education Arni is an alumnus of the United World Colleges in Italy. She has lived in Indonesia, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Italy and the United States.

Under Boisset's leadership, the Boisset Collection operates 28 wineries in California, France, and Canada. Boisset comes from a viticultural family. His father and mother founded a winery in Burgundy, France, in 1961. When a young Boisset visited Buena Vista Winery, in California, with his sister and grandparents, the 11 year old Boisset shared with his family that he wanted to live in the United States one day. Boisset moved to California in the early nineties and purchased his first winery, Lyeth Estates and in 1999 he co-founded Domaine de la Vougeraie with his sister, Nathalie. In 2003, Boisset purchased DeLoach Vineyards in California's Russian River Valley AVA, followed by Raymond Vineyards, located in Napa Valley, California, in 2009 and Buena Vista Winery, located in Sonoma, California, in 2011. Early life Jean-Charles Boisset is the son of Jean- Claude and Claudine Boisset, who founded their family winery, Jean-Claude Boisset, Burgundy, France in 1961. In 1964, the winery acquired its first vineyard, Les Evocelles in the Gevrey-Chambertin commune. Boisset was born in Vougeot, France in 1969. When Boisset was seven years old, he tried two wines from Burgundy: a 1969 Clos de Vougeot and a 1964 Bonnes Mares. He would eventually name a wine under his JCB label \\"No. 7,\\" as a tribute to the first time he tried wine. Boisset's grandparents were part of the French Resistance and his grandfather would go on to fight in World War II. His grandparents' involvement in the war led to their having a strong admiration for US citizens, and as a child, Boisset remembers his grandparents telling him stories about the US soldiers who helped free France. His grandparents encouraged him to visit the United States and to dream to live there one day. At the age of 11, Boisset and his sister Nathalie visited the United States in 1981 for the first time with his grandparents. They visited California, specifically Monterey, San Francisco, and Sonoma. Their grandparents took them on a tour of Buena Vista Winery and later that day, Boisset's grandparents let him and his sister try a Buena Vista Winery Chardonnay that they had purchased during the winery visit. Regarding that wine, Boisset said \\"I was transfixed - such pure, elegant, and tropical notes that we did not know in Burgundy!\\" After their visit to the winery, Boisset suggested to his sister that he hoped to one day own a winery in California. In 2011, he would purchase Buena Vista. As a young man, Boisset was less interested in wine than other pursuits. He almost became a professional footballer. He studied business and finance at the University of London, followed by graduate studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. He earned a Master of Business Administration from the University of San Francisco. Life in wine Boisset was exposed to the wine industry at an early age. He was raised in his family's home near Clos de Vougeot and spent considerable time in the family's vineyards. In the early nineties, the Boisset family sought to close the office of Boisset America (now called the Boisset Collection) in San Francisco. Boisset chose to operate the office, relocating to San Francisco. Shortly thereafter, Boisset purchased his first California winery, Lyeth Estates. In 1999, Boisset and his sister, Nathalie Boisset, created Domaine de la Vougeraie from the family's estate in C√¥te de Nuits and C√¥te de Beaune. In 2003, Boisset purchased DeLoach Vineyards in California's Russian River Valley AVA, followed by Raymond Vineyards, located in Napa Valley, California, in 2009 and Buena Vista Winery, located in Sonoma, California, in 2011. In total, the Boisset Collection includes 24 wineries in Burgundy, Beaujolais, the Rh√¥ne Valley, the South of France, Napa, Sonoma and Monterey, California, and Quebec. The family's estates are certified biodynamic and/or organic wine. Boisset is interested in small production wines that are made utilizing Burgundian winemaking techniques, including the use of pigeage, open-top fermentation, and terroir. His business style has been described as being a \\"more consumer-driven, New World approach.\\" As a wine drinker, Boisset has cited Pinot Noir as his favorite varietal and on his death bed he would drink a 2006 and a 2003 Clos du Vougeot Blanc. =Lyeth Estates= Lyeth Estates was the first American winery purchased by Boisset. =Domaine de la Vougeraie= Boisset and his sister Nathalie founded Domaine de la Vougeraie in 1999, consolidating their family's vineyards in Burgundy. This consolidation included vineyards in the Clos de Vougeot. They also focused on maintaining, or introducing, sustainable farming to each vineyard. The same year as the founding of Domaine de la Vougeraie, Boisset made his first wine, working with 14 other people to process the grapes by hand. He produced two wines: a Clos du Vougeot Blanc and La Mont√©e Rouge. =DeLoach Vineyards= Located in the Russian River Valley AVA, DeLoach Vineyards was founded in 1975. Boisset acquired DeLoach Vineyards in 2003. DeLoach produces Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Zinfandel in the Russian River Valley AVA in Sonoma County. The purchase has been described as a \\"tribute,\\" to Burgundy. Boisset has described the Russian River Valley as \\"the next C√¥te d'Or.\\" Brian Maloney serves as Director of Winemaking at DeLoach Vineyards. =Raymond Vineyards= In 2009, Boisset purchased Raymond Vineyards. The winery was founded in 1971 by Roy Raymond, Sr. and his two sons, Walter and Roy. Raymond's first vintage was in 1974. In 1989, Kirin Holdings purchased the winery, with the Raymond family still managing the property and production. Boisset purchased the property from Kirin. Stephanie Putnam was hired as Director of Winemaker in 2010. Putnam collaborates with Consulting Winemaker Philippe Melka to produce Raymond Vineyards wines. Under Boisset's leadership, Raymond became a biodynamic producer. On-site is a 2-acre exhibition about biodynamic farming, called the Theater of Nature. The self-guided exhibit is the largest exhibit showcasing biodynamic practices in the region. It aims to teach guests about how biodynamic farming impacts Raymond Vineyards' wines via a five act theater-inspired exhibition. The Theater of Nature's gardens produce biodynamic and organic produce. The winery is also operated on 100% solar power. Additionally, Raymond is known for the many \\"experiences,\\" offered to guests, including the \\"Crystal Cellar,\\" which features mannequins hanging from the ceiling, Baccarat crystal and silver made by Christofle. The \\"red room,\\" has a burlesque-style decor, with red velvet. The winery also has a dog friendly space named after Boisset's own dog, Frenchie. In 2012, Raymond Vineyards earned Wine Enthusiast \\"American Winery of the Year\\" award. In 2014, the winery was named by Great Wine Capitals as the Regional Winner for \\"Innovative Wine Tourism Experiences.\\" Raymond Vineyards was named \\"Best Unique Tasting Experience\\" by CellarPass in 2014. The North Bay Bohemian named Raymond Vineyards the \\"Best Winetasting Room\\" in Napa Valley in 2015 and 2016 and for having the best Cabernet Sauvignon. Collaboration with John Legend In late 2015, Raymond introduced LVE: Legend Vineyard Exclusive, a label featuring a Napa Valley Chardonnay and a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon created by Boisset, Stephanie Putnam, and singer-songwriter John Legend. In 2015, Legend performed at Auction Napa Valley, performing as part of Raymond Vineyards' auction lot, which helped to raise $850,000 for Napa Valley charities. The lot included six double magnums of LVE, dinner, and a private concert by Legend at Boisset's Napa Valley home. In 2016, the collaboration between Raymond Vineyards and Legend was awarded the inaugural \\"Wine & Culture\\" award by Wine Enthusiast. =Buena Vista Winery= Boisset purchased Buena Vista Winery, the oldest commercial winery in California, in 2011. It was the first American winery that Boisset had visited, when he was 11 years old. Upon purchasing Buena Vista, Boisset launched a major renovation of the property, which had suffered from disrepair. The historic champagne cellars, built in 1864, almost collapsed and needed to be repaired. Boisset hired contractors, including preservationists to assist with the renovations. The renovations completed, the winery began producing wine in the original cellars for the first time in 2015. Additionally, the winery has a wine tool museum and houses a \\"Bubble Lounge,\\" where guests can taste and purchase Boisset's JCB sparkling wine. =JCB by Jean-Charles Boisset= Boisset has his own wine label, JCB. Each wine in the portfolio is named after a number, i.e. No. 3 JCB, similar to Chanel No. 5. JCB No. 39 is named after the year Boisset's grandparents were married. The label produces still and sparkling wine from France, mainly Burgundy and Provence, California, specifically Napa and Sonoma. JCB Tasting Lounge A tasting lounge for JCB wines is located at DeLoach Winery, Raymond Vineyards and Buena Vista Winery. In 2015, JCB opened the JCB by Jean-Charles Boisset Tasting Lounge at the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco. Located in a room adjacent to the concierge desk, the lounge has a capacity of 10 guests and serves wine flights and food and wine pairings from the hotel's Parallel 37 restaurant. The lounge offers JCB wines and additional wines from Buena Vista and Domaine de la Vougeraie. The space has been described as an \\"opulent French parlor,\\" and \\"over the top,\\" due to the decor, which includes purple velvet couches, gold fringe stools, and leopard print carpet. Additionally, the lounge sells Goyard handbags, Baccarat products, and Boisset's collection of unisex brooches. Tasting Salon and Atelier by JCB In 2016, Boisset opened the JCB Tasting Salon and Atelier by JCB in Yountville. Like the San Francisco- based lounge, wines are available in three different flights, with bottles available for take away purchase. The lounge has a digital touch table designed by Ideum, that guides guests through wine tastings and builds a wine profile based on guests preferred wines. The lounge is decorated with leopard print couches, and cheetah print stools. Mirrors framed in gold hang from the ceiling, along with Baccarat chandeliers. It sells luxury goods, including Baccarat crystal, Christofle silver, and Bernardaud porcelain. Additionally, it sells high end art books. The Atelier sells high end foods, including rare cheeses, meats, foie gras, smoked salmon and caviar. The Atelier is decorated with a Baccarat chandelier and gold leaf covered shelves. It was named the 2nd best place to shop in Napa Valley by USA Today and a cross between \\"Fifth Avenue and Champs-Elysees\\". Surrealist Under the JCB label, Boisset also produces The Surrealist, a Napa Valley red blend wine, decanters, and jewelry in one package. A piece of jewelry is used on the bottle in lieu of a traditional wine label, reflecting old world wine necklaces, and a Baccarat crystal stopper transforms the bottle into a decanter. A set, which includes a bottle of wine, the wine decanter and a brooch costs $500. The bottle can be reused as a decanter after it is emptied. The wine is a blend of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon from eastern Napa Valley and St. Helena. =Alternative wine packaging= Boisset has acknowledged that while glass wine bottles have \\"romance and aesthetic,\\" and the importance of glass for aging wine. However, he believes that alternative packaging \\"helps to improve value, ecology and convenience.\\" Boisset is interested in packaging that reduces carbon footprints while still providing a quality wine experience, especially in places where glass bottles are not allowed. As the president of Boisset Collection, he is credited with the creation of French Rabbit, a wine brand that uses Tetrapaks instead of wine bottles. The brand sells approximately 150,000 cases a year in the United States and Canada. He also introduced Yellow Jersey, a wine brand sold in plastic bottles, using wine from Vin de Pays d'Oc. In 2011, Boisset introduced \\"barrel-to-barrel,\\" packaging at Raymond Vineyards and DeLoach. Similar to a boxed wine concept, 10- to 3-liter bags filled with wine can be placed in reusable barrels for restaurant/bar or home use. The empty bags weigh 99% lighter than a case of empty wine bottles, thus more affordable to ship, and the wine lasts longer. Boisset has also introduced a Beaujolais in an aluminum container called Mommessin. The wine is meant to be drunk chilled and the bottle turns blue when it is at the right drinking temperature. It takes 10 minutes to chill, versus 30 minutes in a glass bottle. He is also credited with being one of the first Burgundian vintners to use screwcaps instead of corks. Personal life Boisset met Gina Gallo, winemaker at Gallo Family Vineyards, in 2006 at a tasting room in Bordeaux. They were married in 2009 at the Fairmont San Francisco. The couple have twin girls, born in 2011. In 2011, Boisset and Gallo purchased the former home of Robert Mondavi in Napa Valley. The family also has an apartment in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco and a home in Burgundy in France. The family travels to Burgundy several times a year, to spend time with Boisset's family and so their daughters can learn about the French culture. Despite both of their roles in the wine industry, Boisset and Gallo do not officially collaborate on wine projects. Achievements Since 2007, Boisset has been named to Decanters Power List. In 2008, he was named \\"Innovator of the Year\\" by Wine Enthusiast. In 2013, he was named one of the \\"20 most admired people in the North American wine industry,\\" by Vineyard & Winery Management. That same year, Boisset was awarded the first ever recipient of the French-American Partnership of Excellence Award awarded by the French-American Foundation. In 2014, Boisset and Gallo were awarded the \\"Global Entrepreneurship Award\\" by John F. Kennedy University. That same year, he was the 2014 Jefferson Award Honoree from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. The following year, in 2015, Boisset was named an Honorary Chair of Sonoma Valley Wine Country Weekend. In 2015 and 2016, he was named to Haute Living's San Francisco's Haute 100 list. Style Boisset's fashion sense has been described as \\"theatrical,\\" \\"unpredictable,\\" \\"flamboyant\\" and \\"fantastical.\\" He wears designer suits and jackets by Tom Ford, Gucci, and Lanvin. Additionally, he is an enthusiast of Louboutin shoes. His red socks have been described as his \\"trademark.\\" He was voted \\"best dressed,\\" in a 2014 reader's poll by the Nob Hill Gazette.

Extending along Quechee Main Street between the Old Quechee Road and the Quechee-West Hartford Road, the village was settled in the 1760s, and has an industrial history extending into the 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The village of Quechee is located in the central-western portion of Hartford, Vermont, and is set mainly on the northern bank of the Ottauquechee River, where a falls near the village center provided the impetus for industrial development. A covered bridge spans the river just below the area of the falls, where a dam creates a modest impoundment to the west. At the northern end of the dam stand the surviving elements of the 19th-century mills, now adapted for other uses. Next to it is the 1857 Parker House, a fine Second Empire home built by a mill owner. The village includes two cemeteries, several church buildings (some converted to other uses, and a former library, built in 1909. with The Quechee area was first settled in the 1760s, and the power of the Ottauquechee River for industrial use was immediately realized: in 1765, the town set aside land near the falls, and by the 1770s a sawmill and gristmill had been established. By the mid-19th century, textile development was underway, producing woolen flannel fabric. The existing mill burned in 1869, and was rebuilt and expanded over the following decades. The mill closed in 1951, and has since been readapted for use as a glass blowing studio. The village itself was transformed by an active redevelopment initiative into a center of recreation and tourism.

The claimants came to court to challenge the decision of the party's National Executive Committee to bar members from voting in the election if they joined the party after 12 January 2016 (i.e. less than six months before the start of voting). This was due to affect approximately 130,000 new members (around one quarter of the party's total membership). The judge at first instance sided with the claimants, although this decision was overturned on appeal. On 14 August, it was announced that the claimants would not be challenging this decision in the Supreme Court. Facts The Labour Party had conducted a leadership election in 2015, concluding on 12 September 2015 in the election of Jeremy Corbyn, whom many considered a dark horse candidate. Tension arose in the party which came to a head when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. More than two dozen members of the Shadow Cabinet resigned over the following two days, and a no-confidence vote was supported by 172 MPs in the Parliamentary Labour Party, against 40 supporting Corbyn. It was reported that Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader, told Corbyn that he would face a challenge to his position as leader. Corbyn stated that he would not resign. In the run up to the 2015 leadership election, the party's membership increased by around 113,000, approximately 80% of whom supported Corbyn. By July 2016, yet more people had joined the party, bringing its total membership to over half a million people. On 29 June 2016, Labour's National Executive Committee met to establish the format of the 2016 leadership contest. It decided that those allowed to vote would be: * Members of the party who had held six months' continuous party membership before the opening of the ballot (i.e. those who joined before 12 January 2016) * Affiliated supporters * Registered supporters who were over 18 years of age, were on the Electoral Roll, whose applications were received between 18 and 20 July 2016, and who paid a ¬£25 fee. The claimants each joined the party after 12 January 2016 and so, under these rules, were not entitled to vote in the leadership election. They challenged this decision as breach of contract. They raised over ¬£40,000 to cover their legal fees through crowdfunding. Judgment =High Court= Submissions were given before Mr Justice Hickinbottom on 4 August 2016 in the High Court of Justice. Stephen Cragg led the case for the claimants and Peter Oldham, for the respondents. Judgment was handed down on 8 August 2016 in favour of the claimants. The claimants' primary claim was that disallowing them to vote in the leadership election constituted a breach of contract. They sought specific performance of the contract to allow them to vote in the election. They argued that the statements made to them by the party that they would be allowed to vote in leadership elections amounted to a term of contract, or alternatively a misrepresentation. The judge established that, as members of an unincorporated association, individuals joining the Labour Party are bound by its constitution and rules, and that additional rules will not readily be implied. The party's Rule Book included many relevant passages which the judge dissected. One especially pertinent passage read: > For the avoidance of doubt, any dispute as to the meaning, interpretation or > general application of the constitution, standing orders and rules of the > Party or any unit of the Party shall be referred to the NEC for > determination, and the decision of the NEC thereupon shall be final and > conclusive for all purposes. The decision of the NEC subject to any > modification by Party conference as to the meaning and effect of any rule or > any part of this constitution and rules shall be final. However, the judge was not entirely persuaded that an erroneous interpretation of the rules should be made good by virtue of it having been made by the party's NEC. He concluded, \\"... the proper interpretation of the Rule Book, as a contract between Party members inter se, is a matter of law for the courts.\\" The judge also considered the following passage from the Rule Book: > The NEC shall have the power to adjudicate in disputes that may arise at any > level of the Party, including between (Constituency Labour Parties > (\\"CLPs\\")), affiliated organisations and other Party units, and between CLPs, > other Party units and individuals in those units and in disputes which occur > between individual members or within the Party organisation. Where the rules > do not meet the particular circumstances, the NEC may have regard to > national or local custom and practice as the case may require. The NEC's > decisions shall be final and binding on all organisations, units and > individuals concerned. The judge additionally noted that the Rules make reference to a \\"freeze date\\" for internal elections, but that it is nowhere defined. In Chapter 5, the Rules establish that members voting in elections to external posts must have been a member for six months prior to voting, but this requirement is notably absent for elections to internal posts, including that of the party leader. The judge took note of the following, contained within an appendix to the rules: > Members enjoy the formal democratic rights of Party membership as stated > within the rules. Party members have the right to participate in the formal > process of the Party, vote at Party meetings, stand for Party office and > elected office as stated within the rules. The court heard evidence that freeze dates had been applied in every Labour leadership election since 1994. The claimants cited the information given to them at the time of joining. Of this information, a relevant passage includes, \\"As a member, you'll be a key part of our election winning team. You'll be eligible to vote in leadership elections, you can help shape party policy, you can attend local meetings and you can even stand as a candidate.\\" The claimants' central claim was summarised by the judge as follows: > It was not open to the NEC to restrict the category of members who can vote, > to those who became members before 12 January 2016, as it purported to do, > whether by imposing a condition that a member must have been such for six > months before a freeze date of 12 July 2016 or by fixing a retrospective > freeze date of 12 January 2016. However it is looked at, under the Rule > Book, the NEC did not have the power to impose that restriction. The respondent argued to the contrary, that the NEC did have the power to apply a freeze date on the basis that the NEC has the untrammelled ability to impose eligibility criteria on voters in internal elections, and the ability to issue procedural guidelines regarding the timetable of those elections. On the basis of all of this argumentation, Mr Justice Hickinbottom was persuaded by the claimants. He was most persuaded by the fact that the Collins Review of leadership elections concluded that the eligible electorate would include members without qualification, and that the party's Rule Book's words on the NEC's ability to make \\"procedural guidelines\\" and set \\"precise eligibility criteria\\" were sufficiently plain on their face as to demonstrate that the NEC does not have the power to set whatever criteria it wishes. The provision cannot be used to redefine \\"members\\" in a \\"wholly artificial way\\". The judge was persuaded that, when the party had referred to a \\"freeze date\\", it had done so in the context of a previous legal decision, which defined freeze dates as follows: > What the imposition of the freeze date does is prevent additional > individuals seeking to become members, especially by reason of encouragement > or inducement by candidates, after the election process has begun.Jeffers v > The Labour Party[2011] EWHC 529 (QB) He held that the NEC had the power to impose freeze dates prospectively, but not retrospectively. He concluded that, > In my view, looking at the structures within the Party as set out in the > Rule Book, it would be extremely surprising if the Rule Book gave the NEC > the power to disenfranchise one-quarter of the Party membership as it > purported to do. In my firm judgment, the Rule Book gives it no such power. =Court of Appeal= The judgment was appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was heard on 11 August 2016, and the judgment of the court was delivered on 12 August 2016. Clive Sheldon led the argument for the appellant (the Labour Party), and David Goldstone, for the respondent (the claimants). The appeal was allowed and the order from the High Court was set aside. The grounds of appeal were as follows: # The judge erred in law in concluding that the NEC had no power under the Labour Party's Rule Book to restrict members who are able to vote in the leadership election to those who had had continuous membership since 12 January 2016. # The judge erred in law in concluding that the NEC's power to impose a \\"freeze date\\" in any leadership election pursuant to Chapter 4 of the 2016 Rule Book was limited to a power to impose a prospective freeze date. In delivering a judgment on behalf of the whole court, Beatson LJ held that the Mr Justice Hickinbottom was wrong to approach the case from the basis that members had a right to vote, rather than that they have only the rights given to them by the Rule Book. At no point do the rules provide that all members can vote. All it does is say that members have \\"equivalent rights within all units of the Party... except as prescribed in these rules.\\" The court also held that the wording of the Rule Book was clear, that the NEC was responsible for setting eligibility criteria, and that its powers are to be considered \\"more broadly than (the claimants) argue.\\" References 2016 in British law English contract case law 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election ","title":"Evangelou v McNicol"},{"id":"51309992","text":"The Wallpapered Manse: The Rescue of an Endangered House is a book by Australian architect Peter Freeman.

Berman (born December 8, 1959) is an American businessman known for his contributions to the casino industry in the US. He has owned and directed several prominent organizations and companies including Empire Resorts and Monticello Raceway. He has also formed partnerships with numerous institutional investors, which led to the acquisition of hotel properties across the US. Berman‚Äôs plans to develop a casino 90 miles from New York City led to a contentious battle with Donald Trump that later led to Trump receiving the largest fine in the history of New York State's lobbying commission. He was involved in several projects concerning the development of Native American gaming in the New York and Idaho area. Early life  Robert A. Berman‚Äôs father, Pip Berman, was a building contractor known for expanding the Concord Resort Hotel and the Imperial Room nightclub where Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Joan Rivers and Jerry Seinfeld performed. At 19 years of age, Robert A. Berman received the first mass gathering permit to operate an outdoor music festival in Sullivan County, New York where a decade earlier the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival was held. Collaborating with music impresario Sid Bernstein on the site of the former Avon Lodge Hotel in Woodridge, New York, Berman opened Music Mountain hosting artists including the Doobie Brothers, members of the Grateful Dead as the Jerry Garcia Band and Bobby and the Midnites, Ozzy Osbourne, The Allman Brothers Band, Santana and various others. Career From 1995 to 2000, Berman co-founded and served as chairman and chief executive officer of Hospitality Worldwide Services (HWS), a publicly traded platform that became one of the most prominent service providers in the Hospitality Industry. By 1998, HWS had several thousand employees with offices around the world. From 1995 to 2000, Berman formed partnerships with institutional investors including ING and Apollo Global Management, which led to the acquisition of more than $100M worth of hotel properties including the Warwick Hotel in Philadelphia and the Radisson Hotel at Chicago's O‚ÄôHare International Airport, amongst others. In 1996 he formed Catskill Development, LLC and purchased Monticello Racetrack. During this time Berman worked towards building a Casino in partnership with the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation Tribe of New York. In 2002 Stanley Tollman, founder of The Travel Corporation, assigned Berman to manage Alpha Hospitality, a public company directed by Tollman that aimed at administering a Casino for the Mohawk tribe. In 2003 he merged Catskill Development with Alpha Hospitality, creating Empire Resorts. From 2002 to 2005, Berman served as chairman and chief executive officer for Empire Resorts, a publicly traded NASDAQ (\\"NYNY\\") gaming company. Berman is also General Partner of Avon Road Partners, LP a private entity that owns Real Estate and broadcast assets including WVOS (AM) & FM. In March 2016, Berman and James (Jim) McCarthy founded KeyStone Solutions, Inc. Donald Trump controversy In 1993 Berman began a project involving an Internet lottery venture in collaboration with the Coeur d'Alene people tribe in Idaho. The project campaigned towards bringing Native American gaming to the Catskill area. This led to federal approval to build the St. Regis Mohawk casino at Monticello Raceway in 2000, which caused rivalry with other regional casino owners, particularly Donald Trump. Trump funded an ad campaign to block the casino from being built by targeting the Mohawk tribe. Anti-Mohawk ads appeared in various newspapers suggesting the negative impact a Native American casino would have on the region. This resulted in Donald Trump receiving an unprecedented fine of $250,000 for secretly funding a lobbying campaign against Native American casinos. Native American gaming In 1994 Berman worked with the Coeur d'Alene people to device the National Indian Lottery via the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The project led to the creation of the Coeur d‚ÄôAlene Casino in Idaho on land donated in trust to the tribe for the project. Berman also worked with the Mohawk people to develop a casino in the Catskill region, New York. In 1998 the National Indian Gaming Commission approved the project to develop and operate a gaming facility on tribal lands. In 1999 the Mohawk people signed the deal with Caesars Entertainment Corporation instead. This led to a multibillion-dollar lawsuit that was eventually dismissed. Personal life Robert Berman has been married to Valerie J. Berman since 2011. His previous spouse is Debbie N. Berman, with whom he had two children, Alan Michael Berman and Jena Beth Berman.

In 1988, after a debate among board members, followed by an institutional consultation with members of EOHR on whether to heed the authorities' warning or not, Hassan was elected as the Secretary General of EOHR, marking the beginning of a transformation in its discourse and mission, as it also started to document abuses against Islamists and advocate for their rights, despite the organization's strong secular orientation. It's noteworthy that the first detailed report on torture to be issued by an Egyptian organization was released under Hassan's time as Secretary General, as well as the first time for an Egyptian NGO to submit reports and complaints to the UN. It is during that period that other prominent human right defenders and intellectuals such as Mohamed el Sayed Said and Negad El Borai established a working relationship with Hassan. In 1993, Hassan along with Mohamed el Sayed Said founded the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) as a human rights NGO with a regional geographic mandate in the Arab region. The underlying philosophy behind the CIHRS was to disseminate and entrench human rights culture within the Egyptian and Arab cultures to create a process of progressive change. Stemming from this philosophy, one of CIHRS' first activities was its Annual Human Rights Summer Course for university students as well as other programs such as Political Islam and Human rights and Arts and Literature in Human Rights, with the overarching objective of instilling and rooting the universal values of human rights across all spectrum's of the Arab societies and cultures. Over the years, Hassan oversaw the expansion of CIHRS from a Cairo-based human rights organization into the largest Arab human rights organization, with representations in Cairo, Tunis, Geneva, and Brussels, with the latter two entirely dedicated to advocacy work with the UN and the EU. In 2004, Hassan reluctantly accepted joining the board of the quasi-governmental National Council for Human Rights (NCHR). However, after serving a turbulent three-year term characterized by his public criticism of NCHR and the government, Hassan refused to serve a second term and publicly resigned, citing the persistent lack of independence of NCHR. After the oust of former President Hosni Mubarak and under the rule of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF), Hassan was offered to serve as deputy to the Minister of Interior for Human Rights, however he declined out of scepticism towards Egypt's trajectory under SCAF. Hassan also refused to re-join the NCHR, once during President Mohamed Morsi's tenure and another time under the-military backed government in 2013-4. Death Threat, Exile, Asset Freeze, and Prison Sentence UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'd and Bahey eldin Hassan meeting in Geneva, Switzerland in 2016 In 2014, and only two weeks after the inauguration of Egypt's President Abdelfatah al-Sisi, Hassan received a death threat for his engagement in bilateral meetings with high level international officials on the human rights situation in Egypt. For safety reasons, and after being advised to do so by NGOs, academics, and senior diplomats inside and outside of Egypt, including from the UN, Hassan has been living in self- imposed exile in France since 2014. In retaliation for his human rights work, media presenters associated with Egyptian security agencies called on the Egyptian authorities to ‚Äúdeal with him [Bahey el-Din Hassan] the same way the Russian spy was dealt with,‚Äù in reference to the nerve agent attack on Serjei Skripal in the United Kingdom. In April 2016, and although never being formally notified, Hassan learned from the media that in relation to the notorious Foreign Funding Case targeting Egyptian human rights NGOs, a court is looking into an asset freeze order against him, his wife, two minor daughters, and his adult daughter who's married to renowned Egyptian activist and blogger Alaa Abdelfattah. Abdelfatah is currently serving a five-year prison sentence for taking part in a protest against the constitutionalizing of military trial of civilians. In August 2020, an Egyptian court sentenced Hassan to 15 years in jail for \\"publishing false news\\" and \\"insulting the judiciary,\\" in addition to an earlier three years sentence issued in September 2019, for a separate case with the same charges. The sentence was widely criticized, including by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the European Parliament, and hundreds of public figures, journalists, academics, artists, and intellectuals from across the world. The sentence was also criticized by the United States, France, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Luxembourg, and the UK as well as prominent human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and FIDH. Views on contemporary Middle Eastern Issues = The Arab Spring = Hassan views the Arab Spring as the natural outcome of decades of oppression, corruption, unrealized social, political and economic aspirations, as well as decades of resistance to any meaningful reform. He attributes the instability that ensued the Arab Spring and rise of terrorist groups in the region to the institutional failure that persisted in Arab countries for decades under its former dictators. In several of his writings, Hassan argued that for as long as the grievances that fuelled the Arab Spring are not addressed, any form of stability achieved will remain unsustainable. Hassan has also called for the establishment of an internal UN mechanism supervised by the Secretary General to address the situation in the Middle East. =Terrorism= Hassan attributes the proliferation of terrorism in the Arab region and through the rest of the world, to the continued failure in addressing the root causes of the problem and over relying on security approaches from as far back as the 9/11 attacks. Hassan points out in his writings that the root causes of terrorism and radicalization lie in poor governance and rule of law; political, social and economic marginalization; rampant human rights violations; and the ongoing degradation of international human rights and humanitarian frameworks. Hassan has also constantly criticized Arab governmental religious institutions, especially al-Azhar and the Wahabi establishment, due to the fact that \\"elements of extremists' narratives could be traced to the discourse of some Arab states' official religious establishments.\\" The use of terrorism by autocratic governments as an excuse for oppression and crackdown on peaceful dissent, as well as the use of heavy-handed security approaches to deal with terrorism, are seen by Hassan as factors that will only continue to exacerbates the situation and increase radicalization. =Political Islam= Despite his strong criticism of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood before and during President Morsi's one-year rule of Egypt in 2013, Hassan believes that Islamist's represent an array of different views and as such, the position from each Islamist group should depend on their stances from violence, democracy and pluralism, as well as civil liberties and personal freedoms. Another important factor according to Hassan is how strongly some Islamist groups match their pro-democracy rhetoric with actions and policies. =Civil- Military Relations= Hassan believes that reforming the military-civil relations in the Arab region is a perquisite to durable stability in the region. He also partly attributes Tunisia's status as the success story of the Arab Spring, to the positive role played by the military during the democratic transition. Membership in other Organizations Besides being the Director of the CIHRS, Hassan is also a member of the boards and advisory committees of several other human rights organizations such as the Euro Mediterranean Foundation of Support to Human Rights Defenders (EMHRF), Human Rights Watch (HRW) Middle East and North Africa Division, International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ). He's also one of the founding members of EMHRF and the Euro Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN). Hassan is also Chief Adviser of the Egyptian Human Rights Forum.

In the late 1980s she was a member of the GDR-opposition movement. On 4 September 1989 she demonstrated \\"For an Open Country with Free People\\", marking the beginning of the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig. Her paintings and social sculptures have been exhibited in Europe.  Life and work  Katrin Hattenhauer was not allowed to sit the Abitur, Germany's secondary-school examinations. Upon completing her school education she worked as a puppeteer at the local theatre in her home town [Nordhausen]. She moved on to working for the Wittenberg research centre of the East-German churches and completed an internship at the Zionsparish in Dresden. In 1988 she took up her studies at the church run theological university in Leipzig. However, due to her increased political activity ‚Äì among other things she had distributed pamphlets for a demonstration in January 1989 - the GDR government pressured the church to force her to leave the university, which she ultimately did. Katrin Hattenhauer was an active member of the ‚ÄòArbeitskreis Gerechtigkeit‚Äô (Working Committee Justice), an independent Leipzig-based opposition group that was part of the network ‚ÄòInitiative Frieden und Menschenrechte‚Äô (Initiative Peace and Human Rights). Moreover, she was active in the Monday Peaceprayers at the Nikolaichurch, which were coordinated by pastor Christoph Wonneberger. Together with the former songwriter Jochen L√§√üig, who had been ex-matriculated from the theological university Leipzig due to his political activity, she organised the first street music festival in the city centre of Leipzig. The festival took place on 10 June 1989. However, the festival had been illegal and numerous contributors, visitors, and pedestrians were arrested. Importantly, the street festival was the first occasion in the GDR on which passers-by solidarised themselves with political dissidents. The Stasi (Staatsicherheitsdienst, state security service) maintained the operational identity check (Operative Personenkontrolle) 'Meise' (Tit) for the surveillance of Katrin Hattenhauer. Yet, despite the regular Stasi- interrogations and an order that prevented her from earning a living almost entirely, she continued to commit herself to political change in the GDR. She went on hunger strike at the Thomas-church Leipzig and criticised the constitutional capacity of the SED directly and openly. Referring to Vaclav Havel she called for the 'bond-slaves' in a system of paternalism' to 'renounce resignation in the society': 'We pray for wisdom and courage, so that what is limited to narrowness and prison for so many may become our home country again'. On 4 September 1989 she initiated, together with Gesine Oltmanns, a demonstration in front of the Nikolaichurch, after the Monday Peace Prayer held there. Both women had prepared four banners, had smuggled them into the church circumventing their surveillants from the Stasi. Coming out into the public square the two women then unfolded their banner that called for 'F√ºr ein offenes Land mit freien Menschen' (For an Open Country with Free People),Speech of the German president Joachim Gauk on the German unity day, Gewandhaus Leipzig 2015 while more activists followed them with the other banners. About 50 activists and 250 people who wanted to emigrate from the GDR joined behind them in a first attempt to move on demonstrating, some shouting 'we want to get out', others 'we stay'. Western TV teams, which had been allowed into Leipzig to cover the fair, had secretly been informed that something would be happening in front of the church. Thus, the footage of the demonstration became the lead story in West-Germany's TV-news, carrying the pictures of this first Mondaydemonstration into every household in East- Germany. Eventually, Stasimen tore down the banners and wrestled down the women but no one was arrested before the cameras since the GDR feared the publicity. On the following Monday, 11 September, Katrin Hattenhauer was targeted demonstrating on Nikolaisquare and arrested together with other protesters and put in the Stasi-prison at Leipzig Beethoven Strasse, where she was imprisoned until 13.10.1089. In prison she was kept in solitary confinement for most of the time and interrogated brutally. Yet, on each following Monday more and more people joined the Mondaydemonstrations in Leipzig, contributing decisively to the eventual downfall of the GDR regime. Regular services and public vigils in different cities of the GDR called for the release of the unjustly imprisoned. Thus, focal points of protest developed, accelerating the democratic revolution. Katrin Hattenhauer was well known in opposition-circles and church-groups in the GDR, she had participated in the Oecomenical Convention and taken part in trans-regional ecological seminars. She was the Leipzig contact person to the ecological library (Umweltbibliothek) a meeting point of the opposition groups in East-Berlin. In 1991 she helped to establish the Archiv B√ºrgerbewegung Leipzig (The Archiv B√ºrgerbewegung received the German National Award in 2015), working on the board. On 8 October 2000 she and Jochen L√§√üig, another dissident, opened the \\"Lichtfest\\" (Festival of Light) in Leipzig, speaking in front of 200.000 people to remember the crucial turning point in 1989. On 7 November 2014 Katrin Hattenhauer spoke at Germany's ceremonial act, celebrating the 25 year anniversary of the fall of the wall and German reunification at the Brandenburg Gate. There, she addressed the younger generation, urging them to 'take their freedom and live their dreams. The touring exhibition 'Revolution is female' recognizes her and other women's contributions to the Peaceful Revolution 1989. Katrin Hattenhauer often comments on the Peaceful Revolution 1989 and questions of German unity. Similarly, she speaks on radio, TV and frequently at schools, answering questions about civil courage. She is serving on the board of the Kreisau-Initiative and on the historical commission of the Krzyzowa/Kreisau foundation in Poland. In October 2015 she initiated an open letter of former East-German dissidents to Angela Merkel, supporting a policy of open borders for refugees who seek political asylum. The letter was published by the Deutsche Welle in English, French, Russian and Spanish. She has got one son and is living together with her husband in Berlin and Oxford. Work as an artist In the wake of the Peaceful Revolution Katrin Hattenhauer became an artist. Her first exhibition \\"Magical Theatre\\" was opened in her flat in Leipzig on 9.December 1989. She has had exhibitions in numerous places in Europe and in the United States. The secretary-general of the biennial national Protestant gathering (Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag), Ellen Uebersch√§r, described her art as follows: \\"Hattenhauer's art is not GDR-art, not art of the GDR, it is an answer to the GDR, it is the 'even though' of an art that says 'Yes' to freedom against all odds.‚Äù Her figurative paintings focus on human emotion, freedom, and civil engagement. The late Freya von Moltke wrote about her: In the time before and around 1989, Katrin Hattenhauer has dared to demand freedom and has experienced what that can mean for the personal future. Stemming from this experience her paintings express great courage and joy in life.\\" Katrin Hattenhauer, continually works with young people, using her art to approach questions of personal freedom and civil courage. In the last years Katrin Hattenhauer has turned towards and focused on installation art addressing various political and societal topics. \\"Lichtgestalten\\" about role models, Mannheim 2012, \\"M√ºllwiese\\" (Rubbish Meadow) Hamburg shed and artistic light on the pollution of the oceans through plastic waste, while '√úber das Verschwinden (On Disappearing), London and Leipzig, raised awareness of the murder of political dissidents. At the moment she is linked with the Social Sculpture Unit, Brookes University Oxford. Katrin Hattenhauer was awarded the Officer's Cross of the German Order of Merit.

She was an advocate for mother and children's health assistance in Brazil during the first half of 20th century.  Early life  On December 3, 1879, Byington was born as Pearl Ellis McIntyre in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Byington's parents were Mary Elisabeth Ellis and Robert Dickson McIntyre, American Confederado immigrants who settled in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste. She adopted the Portuguese form of her name (P√©rola) and in 1894 when P√©rola was fourteen years old, she completed the preparation for the Normal School, but was not admitted because the minimum age requirement was sixteen years old.  Education  Byington received private lessons in education, except Latin, which she took at a boys' school , where P√©rola had to hide behind a folding screen so as not to attract the attention of the teacher and the boys. In 1897, P√©rola took the entrance exams for the annex course of the Law Academy of S√£o Paulo. She didn't pass the geography test and neither was well received by the academics, who did not want to admit women. In 1899, at the age of 19, Byington finished the normal course.  Career  During the First World War, Byington was in the United States, where she was responsible for a section of the Red Cross. Upon returning to Brazil, she continued participating in philanthropic activities. From the 1930s, Byington alongside the teacher Maria Antonieta de Castro led a campaign to combat child mortality, called \\"Cruzada Pr√≥-Inf√¢ncia\\", (Crusade for Childhood) a task which she held for 33 years. She also dedicated herself to several other programs in defense of the disadvantaged, especially children, having been awarded several commendations of merit.  Personal life  On July 4, 1901, Byington married Albert Jackson Byington, an electrical engineer who imported the first electric motor to Brazil. They had two children. On 6 November 1963, Byington died in New York City, New York, United States. P√©rola Byington Hospital, reference center in women's health, in S√£o Paulo, Brazil = Legacy = In her honor, a hospital dedicated to women's health in S√£o Paulo is named after her. P√©rola, a municipality of the state of Paran√°, was named after her; Alberto Byington J√∫nior, P√©rola's son, was one of the partners of the Companhia Byington de Coloniza√ß√£o Ltda., the company that bought land and settled in the region. Byington is the great-grandmother of actress Bianca Byington and singer Olivia Byington. She is also the great- great-grandmother of the musician Greg√≥rio Duvivier.

Early life  Banks was born and raised in the small North Yorkshire village of Oldstead. He grew up there with his older brother, James, and parents, Tom and Anne Banks. Banks comes from a farming background, with the Banks family farming in and around Oldstead for five generations. The Banks family also ran a B&B; from their family home before buying their local pub, The Black Swan, in 2006. Cooking and the hospitality industry was never at the forefront of Bank's mind when he was younger. His ambition was to play cricket professionally, leaving school during his A-Levels to play the sport six days a week, alongside working in his parent's pub. Unfortunately, when he was 18 years old, Banks developed ulcerative colitis. He underwent three major operations, and was subsequently bedridden for 18 months. It was during this time that he began reading a lot of cookbooks and watching cookery programmes, giving him a newfound passion for food, returning to work more determined and grounded. Career In 2006, when he was 17, Banks' parents bought the pub and restaurant The Black Swan at Oldstead, and he became involved in the running of the business. He worked in the kitchen and started to learn to cook. He had no formal training as chef, but worked several unpaid stages in Michelin-starred restaurants including a week spent in Raymond Blanc's restaurant in Oxfordshire, Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. The restaurant at The Black Swan first won a Michelin Star in 2012 with Adam Jackson as chef. When Jackson left to set up his own restaurant in June 2013, Banks took over as head chef at The Black Swan. At the age of 24, Banks was the youngest chef to receive a Michelin Star when the restaurant retained its Michelin Star that year. In 2013 the family developed a three- acre kitchen garden in the field next to the restaurant. Having the garden allowed The Banks to grow food that was unique to them and allowed them to be able to serve ingredients that can not be procured elsewhere; examples being Crapaudine beetroot, Black Truffe potatoes and Wineberries. On 5 April 2018 Bank's debut cookbook 'Roots' was published by The Orion Publishing Group and it was the UK winner for the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards in the Chef category 2018. On 15 September 2018 Banks and his close friend and business partner Matthew Lockwood opened the Banks's second restaurant, Roots, in the centre of York. The restaurant is a tasting menu format, which also uses produce grown in the garden and on the farm is transported to the city on a daily basis. In March 2020 Banks and Lockwood launched Made In Oldstead, a premium food box delivery service. This was launched primarily to help pay suppliers and staff unable to be furloughed after the temporary closure of their restaurants due to COVID-19. However, in July 2020, they announced that the food boxes will remain a permanent fixture to the business, delivering three and five-course menus to homes across the UK. Television In 2016, Banks took part in Great British Menu. In the final, he won the fish course with a dish entitled 'Preserving The Future'. He also appeared in the programme in 2017 and again won with his fish course of turbot with strawberries and cream. Banks was co-host of The Big Family Cooking Showdown with Angellica Bell in 2018. He regularly appears on Saturday Kitchen and Sunday Brunch as a guest chef. Since 2019, Banks has been a veteran guest judge for Great British Menu. In 2019 he judged the Northern Ireland heats which was won by Chris McClurg, and in 2020 he judged the London and South East heats, won by Kerth Gumbs. Awards and Accolades Banks has achieved great attention and national recognition since he began his career. In 2013, at the age of twenty-four, he became the youngest Michelin-starred chef in Britain when The Black Swan retained its star. In 2016, The Black Swan also gained a 4th AA Rosette making it unique at the time as the only restaurant in Yorkshire to hold a Michelin Star and 4 AA Rosettes simultaneously. In 2017, The Black Swan was named 'The Best Restaurant in the World' by customer review site TripAdvisor. In 2019, Banks won the 'Local Food Hero' award at the Observer Food Monthly Awards. As well as this, both The Black Swan and Roots were named in Restaurant Magazine's Top 100 Restaurants in the UK (at 29 and 42 respectively). In Waitrose's prestigious Good Food Guide, The Black Swan was also Yorkshire's highest-ranked restaurant in their Top 50 list. In 2020, Roots received the Taste of York awards at the Visit York Tourism Awards. The Black Swan also received the accolade of the UK's Best Fine Dining Restaurant in TripAdvisor's prestigious travel awards.

Life  She was the daughter of an astrolabist known as al- ªIjliyy al-Asturlabƒ´. According to ibn al-Nadim, she was an apprentice (tilmƒ´thah) of Mu·∏•ammad ibn  ªAbd AllƒÅh Nas·π≠≈´lus. She developed and manufactured astrolabes, an astronomical and navigation instrument, during the 10th century. She was employed by the Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla, who reigned from 944 to 967 AD. Beyond that information, very little is known about her. Even her supposed name, \\"Mariam\\", is not supported by sources from her time. The phrase \\"al-Asturlabiyy\\" in the names by which she is known simply means \\"the astrolabist\\", and indicates her profession; astrolabes were long known by her time.  Legacy  The main-belt asteroid 7060 Al-'Ijliya, discovered by Henry E. Holt at Palomar Observatory in 1990, was named in her honor. Naming citation was published on 14 November 2016 ().

The ensemble debuted in 2005 with a performance of ‚ÄúCelebrating Don Quixote,‚Äù featuring a commissioned production of Manuel de Falla‚Äôs puppet opera Master Peter‚Äôs Puppet Show, along with rarely heard works by Oscar Espla and Roberto Gerhard. In the 2000s, the ensemble received a $200,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. In 2016, PCE's presentation of three American documentaries; ‚ÄúThe Plow that Broke the Plains,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe River,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe City,‚Äù with original scores by Virgil Thomson generated two Naxos DVDs. Its release of a newly recorded score for the Mexican docu-film Redes received a strongly positive view from the Los Angeles Times, and its festival honoring the works of Bernard Hermann was praised by several U.S. music critics for highlighting Hermann's works. Activities PostClassical Ensemble's repertoire emphasizes music composed after 1900, producing the work of artists such as Lou Harrison, Bernard Hermann, and Silvestre Revueltas. PCE has collaborated with such artists as pianists Jeremy Denk, Benjamin Pasternak, Alexander Toradze, William Wolfram, clarinetist David Krakauer, baritones Christ√≤pheren Nomura and William Sharp, bass-baritone Kevin Deas, pipa virtuoso Min Xiao-fen, and other internationally prominent artists.

It is a weak antiandrogen, and is devoid of androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic activity. It was investigated as a topical antiandrogen for the treatment of androgen-dependent skin conditions in the early 1950s, and was found to produce some benefit. In 1995, 11Œ±-OHP, along with its epimer 11Œ≤-hydroxyprogesterone, was identified as a very potent competitive inhibitor of both isoforms (1 and 2) of 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11Œ≤-HSD). It is notably not metabolized by 11Œ≤-HSD2. 11Œ±-OHP is a more potent inhibitor of 11Œ≤-HSD than enoxolone (glycyrrhetinic acid) or carbenoxolone in vitro (IC50 = 0.9 nM; IC50 = 5 nM in transfected cells). The compound has been found to be highly active in conferring mineralocorticoid sodium-retaining activity of corticosterone in vivo in rat bioassays and in increasing blood pressure, effects that it mediates by preventing the 11Œ≤-HSD-mediated inactivation of endogenous corticosteroids. Because of its inhibition of 11Œ≤-HSD and consequent potentiation of corticosteroids, 11Œ±-OHP has recently been patented for the treatment of skin diseases, particularly psoriasis in combination with clobetasol propionate and minoxidil. 11Œ±-OHP is used as a precursor in chemical syntheses of cortisone and hydrocortisone.

It is written in Go and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics. It also has support for processing data from Graphite.  History  Y Combinator-backed Errplane began developing InfluxDB as an open-source project in late 2013 for performance monitoring and alerting. Errplane raised an $8.1M Series A financing led by Mayfield Fund and Trinity Ventures in November 2014. In late 2015, Errplane officially changed its name to InfluxData Inc. InfluxData raised Series B round of funding of $16M in September 2016. In Feb. 2018, InfluxData closed a $35 million Series C round of funding led by Sapphire Ventures, which funds category-leading growth technology companies.  Technical overview  InfluxDB has no external dependencies and provides a SQL-like language, listening on port 8086,https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/administration/ports/ with built-in time-centric functions for querying a data structure composed of measurements, series, and points. Each point consists of several key-value pairs called the fieldset and a timestamp. When grouped together by a set of key-value pairs called the tagset, these define a series. Finally, series are grouped together by a string identifier to form a measurement. Values can be 64-bit integers, 64-bit floating points, strings, and booleans. Points are indexed by their time and tagset. Retention policies are defined on a measurement and control how data is downsampled and deleted. Continuous Queries run periodically, storing results in a target measurement.  Events  InfluxData regularly hosts events related to InfluxDB called InfluxDays. The InfluxDays are technical conventions focused on the evolution of InfluxDB on technical and business points of views. Those events take place once a year in three locations: New-York, San Francisco or London. The InfluxDays cover a wide variety of different subjects: software engineering and coding talks as well as business-focused and practical workshops. Companies can showcase how they use InfluxDB.  Line protocol  InfluxDB accepts data via HTTP, TCP, and UDP. It defines a line protocol backwards compatible with Graphite and takes the form: :\`measurement(,tag_key=tag_val)* field_key=field_val(,field_key_n=field_value_n)* (nanoseconds-timestamp)?\`  Closed source clustering components  In May 2016, InfluxData announced that the horizontally scalable \\"clustering\\" component of InfluxDB would be sold as closed-source software in order to create a sustainable source of funding for the project's development. Community reaction was mixed, with some feeling the move was a \\"bait and switch\\".

Frederick was educated at the Butts School before completing an apprenticeship making horse collars, then moved to Manchester to work.Eric Taylor, \\"Dean, Frederick James (1868-1941)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.II, pp.117-119 In about 1900, Dean returned to Walsall to take over the tobacconist shop which his father had been running as a sideline. He also assisted his father in running the Pelsall Miners and, in 1910, when his father died, Frederick easily won a vote to succeed him. He led the union through two major industrial actions, in 1912 and 1921; its financially strong position enabling it to support its members. Dean was long a Liberal-Labour supporter, serving on Rushall Parish Council and the Walsall Board of Guardians and standing for Walsall Town Council. However, in 1916 he belatedly followed the majority of coal miners in switching his allegiance to the Labour Party. In 1922, he was elected to the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, but he resigned all his trade union posts the following year, due to poor health. He stood down from the Board of Guardians in 1924, and suffered a series of strokes. Over the next few years, he ran a new tobacconist business and served as a magistrate but, by the mid-1930s, he was confined to bed, ultimately dying in 1941.

Hanson and published by Mindscape for the Commodore 64. The game is based on the Indiana Jones series, and was released in North America around January 1985, while a UK version was released in March 1985. Gameplay requires the player to think like fictional archaeologist Indiana Jones to solve the puzzles of each level, as the game does not provide the player with any rules or gameplay information; the game's cover advertised, \\"Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you.\\" Gameplay Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom features six levels played across a \\"Lost Kingdom.\\" Playing as Indiana Jones, the player must solve a puzzle in each level to progress through the game. The player's ultimate goal is to retrieve a valuable artifact that contains the secrets of a lost civilization, before Jones' arch- rival, Ivar Reiss, can take it for himself. Indiana Jones is armed only with a mystical cane, and must battle against numerous enemies and perils throughout the game, including bats, monsters, steep cliffs, twisting mazes, and \\"killer snowflakes\\". Joystick movements vary between each level, requiring the player to relearn the control scheme throughout the game. A two-player option is also available. No rules or gameplay information is provided to the player, who is left to use logic and intuition to solve each puzzle, as Indiana Jones would. Solving each puzzle requires the player to pay close attention to subtle changes in each level's surroundings or musical score, as well as other possibilities, testing the player's \\"Indiana Jones Quotient\\" (IJQ). However, the game's instruction manual does feature clues at the bottom of each page. Each clue is presented as a hieroglyphic, and must be deciphered by the player using a magic viewer, similar to 3D glasses. A \\"clue hotline\\" was also available for players, providing them with pre-recorded hints on how to finish each level. Reception Robert J. Sodaro of Ahoy! wrote, \\"I must admit, the lure of the Lost Kingdom is strong, but having to fumble through several sessions without direction almost sent me hying back to civilization. No documentation may have sounded good in the planning stages, but at the game- playing stage, engaging and coherent instructions would have sounded much better. If you have the tenacity to muddle through, however, you'll find much enjoyment in accompanying Indy on his further adventures. A fellow reviewer once wrote that a good game was one he'd return to play after the review was written. For me, Indiana Jones is one of those games.\\" DX Fenten of Commodore Power/Play wrote, \\"Should you be the kind of person who can sit, hour after hour, enjoying the challenge of trying to figure out what the creators had in mind and 'think like Dr. Jones,' there is a very good chance you will love this game. Otherwise, you'll soon need either a break from the game, some aspirin, or some additional help in the way of clues.\\" Fenten concluded, \\"There is a great deal to be admired and enjoyed in this program. There is also a great deal that is just a little bit forbidding to the 'regular' game player. The key seems to be your desire to win the game, to stick with it, to endure the changing requirements throughout the game and to accept the challenge created by the omission of any written rules.\\" Benn Dunnington of INFO=64 gave the game three stars out of five and wrote that the game's \\"packaging, marketing, concept, and intended cinematic associations fail to translate into a satisfying product. This game is boring, roughly animated, and sure to disappoint Indiana Jones fans. Better title: 'Indiana Jones in the Kingdom of Lost Causes'.\\" Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"Players more interested in fancy graphics and slick joystick action may find the game a little dull. But those who prefer thinking their way through a problem will find plenty to puzzle over.\\" Commodore Computing International rated the game three stars out of five and wrote that the \\"less-than-peppy\\" opening theme was among the game's \\"several mild disappointments\\", saying that the game \\"doesn't quite live up to its name, though it certainly is still worth a determined try.\\" The magazine criticized the game's \\"average\\" graphics but praised the \\"clearly drawn\\" Indiana Jones figure. Computer and Video Games criticized the game's difficulty, including its puzzles: \\"You have to do certain things in a certain way or a certain order before you get to the next screen. It can get quite frustrating.\\" The magazine concluded, \\"The graphics are OK but not brilliant and the sound could be better. Overall a bit of a disappointing game given that it's based on the exploits of such a superhero as Indiana Jones.\\" References External links * Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom at MobyGames 1985 video games Commodore 64 games Commodore 64-only games L Puzzle video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom"},{"id":"51310529","title":"2016‚Äì17 Towson Tigers men's basketball team"},{"id":"51310541","text":"Hamuro (written: ) is a Japanese surname.

Moreover, paratroopers of the 25th Airborne Brigade surrendered their equipment and retreated to Dnipropetrovsk on buses when tasked with engaging pro-Russian insurgents in Donetsk. This prompted governor Ihor Kolomoyskyi and Dnipropetrovsk mayor Ivan Kulichenko to quickly organize a defence for the city, also volunteer units began to form funded by various charities and oligarchs forming the Dnipro Battalion. The Dnipro Battalion has been fighting Russian insurgents in Luhansk and Donetsk oblast since its creation. Due to being one of the first units to form and the unit's proximity to the Donbass volunteers often received minimal training before deploying to engage insurgents.

She has works in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Great Plains Art Museum, as well as others. She was selected to work on the United States post office murals project of the U.S. Treasury during the New Deal and completed a mural for the Valentine, Nebraska post office. A mosaic by Faulkner in Kenosha, Wisconsin adorns the former bakery on the Kemper Hall grounds. She was an associate professor of Art at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln between 1930 and 1950 and then instructed headed the Art Department at Kemper Hall until her retirement. Early life Katherine Burnap Faulkner was born on June 23, 1901, in Syracuse, New York, to Margaret and Philip Faulkner. The family were related to the founders of the Simmons Mattress Company. She was the eldest of two daughters and contracted polio at a young age. After her recovery from the disease, she earned a BA from Syracuse University in 1925. Faulkner went on to continue studies at The Art Students League of New York for two years and then in 1928 studied at the Grand Central School of Art. That same year, she began studying at the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln (UNL). Career In 1930, Faulkner began instructing drawing and painting at UNL. She continued her own training, studying with Hans Hofmann in New York City in 1933 and with Boardman Robinson from the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and fresco muralist Henry Varnum Poor, working each summer until she completed her master's degree from Syracuse University. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s Faulkner exhibited at numerous galleries, gaining membership in the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1936 based upon four works submitted to the association for review. Her painting Prairie Farm was included in the organization's annual show that year. She participated in exhibitions in Dallas, Denver, Kansas City, New York City, Philadelphia and Syracuse and several shows with the Lincoln Artists Guild, including her works American Vacation, Dustbowl, Georgetown and Lost in the Forest. Dustbowl was featured in Art News Magazine in January 1938 andGeorgetown won honorable mention in a Lincoln show in 1939. After competing for the New Deal post office competition of the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture for Dallas, Faulkner was awarded the commission for Valentine, Nebraska. In 1939, she finished End of the Trail, her mural for the Valentine, Nebraska post office. The painting is a tempera panel, representing goods arriving via train and being offloaded into wagons for settlers' use. Faulkner completed murals for two churches in Nebraska and at the building housing the student union at UNL, before resigning from UNL in 1950. That same year, she accepted a position as head of the Art Department at a private Episcopalian boarding school, Kemper Hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Faulkner completed a mural for the chapel altar in Racine, Wisconsin for the DeKoven Foundation and in 1962, Faulkner designed a mosaic for the wall of the former bakery building on the Kemper campus. The building had been used by the Episcopalian Sisters of St. Mary, who had founded the school, to produce communion wafers. The proceeds of the wafers paid the expenses for the order and were sold internationally. The mosaic is 12 feet tall and 30 feet in length, depicting in three sections, the wine, the bread and the ingredients of the Eucharist. Though the school closed in 1975, it was preserved as a cultural center, with many of the buildings being restored. The bakery building was renamed in honor of Faulkner. In 2013, the Kenosha Historic Preservation Commission recommended that the mosaic be listed in the National Registry. Faulkner retired from Kemper in 1972, but continued to teach oil and watercolor classes after her retirement through the late 1970s. Faulkner died 7 May, 1977 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Legacy In 1972, a scholarship was established in her name by the Greater Kenosha Arts Council. She has works in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Museum of Nebraska Art and the Great Plains Art Museum, as well as others.

This species and the Mexican violetear were formerly considered as conspecific and named the 'green violetear'. Male displaying its \\"ears\\" showing neck stretching  Taxonomy and systematics  The lesser violetear belongs to the order Apodiformes. Hummingbirds share this order with the swifts, such as the white-collared swift. The name Apodiformes is derived from the Greek words \\"a pous,\\" meaning \\"without foot.\\" While apodiforms do in fact have feet, they are quite small and their legs are short and relatively weak. Many birds in this order cannot walk, and thus rarely if ever land on the ground since quick escape from predators is virtually impossible. For this reason members of this order spend a majority of their time in the air. = Subspecies = The lesser violetear has four sub-species: * C. c. cabanidis (Heine), 1863) \\\\- Costa Rica, western Panama * C. c. cyanotus (Bourcier, 1843) \\\\- Colombia, northwestern Venezuela, Ecuador * C. c. kerdeli Aveledo & Perez, 1991 \\\\- northeastern Venezuela * C. c. crissalis Todd, 1942 \\\\- Peru and Bolivia  Description  The lesser violetear is roughly medium-sized by hummingbird standards. It averages around in total length. Its bill is black and mostly straight with only a slight downward curve and measures from . The body mass can vary from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is and the tail is . It is shining green above with a glittering violet ear-patch on the sides of its neck. Its throat and chest are a more glittering green with a shining green belly. The tail is a metallic blue-green with more bronzy central feathers and a prominent black subterminal band. = Vocalizations = Solitary males sing from high, exposed twigs in their territory every day. Their song is a monotonously repeated sharp and dry ‚Äútsu-tzeek‚Äù at a rate of about one call per second.  Distribution and habitat  = Distribution = The lesser violetear breeds from the highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama; mountains of northern Venezuela, and the Andes from western Venezuela to western Bolivia. = Habitat = Common habitats for the lesser violetear are in the canopy and borders of subtropical and lower temperate forest, secondary woodland and scrub, and clearings and gardens in the subtropical zone on both slopes of the Andes. It is recorded mostly between altitudes of , though they will sometimes wander as far down as in search of food sources. It generally prefers more humid and high-altitude areas, such as cloud forests, than the similar sparkling violetear and is completely absent from the central valley where the sparkling violetear is most prevalent. However, the two species will sometimes be seen in the same areas feeding at flowering Inga trees.  Behavior and ecology  = Diet = The lesser violetear forages alone but tends to gather at flowering trees, especially coffee-shade Inga. They feed at mid-level to canopy and often hold and defend a feeding territory. They primarily feed on nectar and small insects. The lesser violetear has been recorded as attaining the greatest flying speed ever recorded for a hummingbird, with a pair of birds having attained during a chase, although other species may be able to attain similar speeds. = Breeding = Like most hummingbirds, the lesser violetear is a solitary nester. The male's only involvement in the breeding process is to attract and mate with the female. The female is then responsible for choosing a nest location, generally on a low, small horizontal branch in a protected area. The nest is small and built from various plant materials, spider webs, and down woven together to form a sturdy cup structure. Two small white eggs are laid within the nest and the female incubates them on her own. Incubation time is 14‚Äì18 days. Hatchlings are primarily fed insects due to high nutritional requirements. No information was found on the length of the nestling stage or age at fledgling. Breeding takes place though the wet season into the early dry season, which varies by latitude.

Born in the Darnall area of Sheffield, Lockwood left school at the age of fourteen. He took various jobs before settling as a pattern-maker. He spent much of his spare time at the Darnall Congregational Church and its associated temperance society. An early member of the Workers Educational Association, he also joined the Independent Labour Party and the Labour Party. This political activity led his employer to sack him, and he instead became an insurance agent.Frederick C. Padley, \\"Lockwood, Arthur (1883-1966)\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.II, pp.237-239 In 1912, Lockwood stood as a Labour candidate for the Darnall ward on Sheffield City Council, although he was easily defeated. Undeterred, he stood for Sheffield Hillsborough at the 1918 UK general election, with the backing of what became the Co-operative Party. He took 4,050 and a distant second place, but was considered to have built up the party, locally, enabling A. V. Alexander to win the seat for the party in 1922. Lockwood instead moved to London to act as election agent for Alfred Barnes, who won East Ham South in 1922 as a joint Co-operative-Labour candidate. Following this success, Lockwood became the election agent for the Reading Labour Party and, by 1924, the party's first MP for the town was elected. While in the town, Lockwood also ran the Reading Citizen, a labour movement newspaper, and stood regularly for the town council, but did not win a seat until 1932; he served until 1939, and also for a year in 1944. In 1930, he became the circulation manager for Reynolds' News, but remained based in Reading and served on the committee of the Reading Co-operative Society, including a stint as president from 1947 until 1959.

Prominence In 1864, Peter Sarbach was a porter for Sir Edward Whymper in one of his attempts to ascend the Matterhorn. Subsequently, he became a guide in the Swiss Alps and surrounding area. The competent guiding skills of Peter Sarbach were well renowned. At age 53, he was invited to Canada for an 1897 first ascent expedition of Mt. Lefroy; and hence he became the first Swiss guide to work in the Canadian Rockies. Canadian Accomplishment The guiding skills of Peter Sarbach were commissioned, in a roundabout way, at the request of Edwin Hale Abbot, the father of Philip Stanley Abbot. Hence, together with John Norman Collie, Professor Harold Baily Dixon, George Percival Baker, Professor Charles Ernest Fay, and others, Peter Sarbach lead a memorial first ascent of Mt.

Historic significance Peter Sarbach returned to his home in Switzerland in the fall of 1897, and never returned to Canada; so his prominence faded somewhat. However, the impression he left, from his 1897 expeditions, would set the pace for Swiss Mountaineering influence in Canada.

The largest drone show in history, featuring 1,218 Shooting Star drones, was planned for the ceremony but cancelled at the last minute; television audiences were shown a version that had been recorded the previous December. During the opening ceremony the organizing committee was a victim of a cyber attack, but without major consequences. Programme =Parade of Nations= The Parade of Nations was led, according to custom due to hosting the original ancient Olympics, by the Greek team, followed by other competing countries in alphabetical order based on their names in the Korean language, with the host country, South Korea, concluding the march. The delegations from both the host nation South Korea and North Korea (Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics) marched under the Korean unification flag. South Korean Won Yun-jong and North Korean Hwang Chung-gum both held the flagpole. Even though the temperature in the stadium during the ceremony was very cold, Bermuda's delegation wore shorts and Tongan Pita Taufatofua repeated his shirtless and oiled up Summer Olympic appearance.

He said \\"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as the first torchbearer for the Olympic Winter Games of 2018. It is truly a unique moment that I am looking forward to. I feel very proud and with a unique sense of happiness.\\" Park Ji-Sung, football player in Republic of Korea, was the second person to hold the torch. After the flame touring around Greece for a week, it reached the Acropolis on 30 October. There were 36 ceremonies held in different cities over a week, then the flame arrived to the PyeongChang Panathenaic Stadium. More than 500 torchbearers participated to follow the rituals of Olympic cycle, and carried the message of peace. In the stadium, Opera soloist Sumi Hwang sang the Olympic anthem during the torch lighting ceremony. The final person to hold the torch was Inbee Park, the golfer from Republic of Korea. Jong Su-hyon from North Korea and Park Jong-ah from South Korea carried the torch and headed up stairs toward the cauldron. As the torch neared the cauldron, an ice skating rink with South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim was revealed. Yuna Kim is the well-known figure skater who won gold medal in 2010 and silver medal in 2014. The cauldron was designed to represent a full moon when it is not lit.

Controversies =Russian hacking= On 24 February, The Washington Post reported that U.S. intelligence uncovered Russian spies hacked computers during the Opening Ceremony, an act that was previously speculated to be the work of North Korea.

Just two prototypes were ever built, and one survives today. History In 1960 Innocenti‚Äîwhose main products were machinery and the successful Lambretta motor scooter‚Äîhad entered the car industry, beginning assembly of British Motor Corporation models in its Lambrate factory. Founder Ferdinando Innocenti desired to expand his automotive operations introducing a small grand tourer, and related his idea to Enzo Ferrari. In 1963 this materialised in form of an agreement between the two car manufacturers: Ferrari would design a coup√© with a V6 engine‚Äîfundamentally half of a Ferrari V12. An engineering team was put together in Maranello, overseen by Innocenti's technical director Sandro Colombo assisted by Innocenti engineers, and composed by Ferrari personnel‚Äîincluding engine designer Franco Rocchi. The 186 GT was powered by a , 12-valve, single overhead cam 60¬∞ V6 (bore and stroke 77√ó64 mm), producing at 7,000 rpm. The engine was mated to a British-derived 4-speed manual transmission with overdrive on third and fourth gear. The chassis was, in Ferrari tradition, a steel tube frame with separate body, using front double wishbone suspension, and a rear live axle on leaf springs with reaction arms. There were disc brakes on all four corners, and Borrani wire wheels fitted with 175√ó14\\" Pirelli Cinturato tyres. A prototype chassis was rapidly built and delivered to the Turinese design house Bertone, which was tasked with design and eventually production of the bodyshell. There Giorgetto Giugiaro (then employed by Bertone) designed a 2+2 fastback coup√©, and the first car was completed with part-aluminium coachwork. While the first example underwent some tests on Innocenti's Lambrate factory track, Colombo and the other Innocenti engineers involved in the project worked with Bertone on another, unibody version of the car. A unibody prototype was built, and was set to be the production version. Ultimately in 1964 the whole project was halted, when almost ready for series production. Sandro Colombo proposes two reasons for this decision. One is the Innocenti car sales network, too little developed and not adequate for the distribution of such an upscale vehicle‚Äîstill depending as it was on many Lambretta motorcycle dealers. The other is the Italian recession of 1964‚Äì65, a less than ideal conjuncture to launch an expensive GT car aimed at affluent buyers. Of the two prototypes, one was destroyed, while the other remained in storage at an Innocenti facility. When the building was demolished in 1994 following Fiat's acquisition of Innocenti, the surviving 186 GT was rescued by Maserati historian Ermanno Cozza. In 2015 it was part of an exhibition at the Museo Ferrari in Maranello.

McMullin ran as an independent presidential candidate, but also received the presidential nominations of Better for America, Independence Party of Minnesota, Independent Party of Florida, and South Carolina Independence Party. Provo Background The controversial candidacy of Donald Trump for the Republican Party nomination caused the creation of the Stop Trump movement, which sought to stop his nomination or find a candidate to oppose him. After months of unsuccessful searching, Evan McMullin decided to run as a conservative alternative candidate based on Trump's divisive comments on a variety of issues, calling him a potential threat to the Republic. Campaign On August 10, 2016, Evan McMullin, the former chief policy director for the House Republican Conference and a former CIA operations officer, announced that he would run for the presidency of the United States as an independent. Kahlil Byrd, who served as the CEO of Americans Elect, formed a SuperPAC to support McMullin's candidacy. McMullin received support from multiple anti-Trump Republicans including former Washington Senator Slade Gorton, former Secretary of State of Washington Sam Reed, and former Utah Lieutenant Governor Greg Bell. On October 6, McMullin selected Mindy Finn, who had supported Marco Rubio during the Republican presidential primaries, to serve as his vice-presidential running mate. Although McMullin had selected Mindy Finn to serve as his vice-presidential running mate she did not appear on the ballot in any states. Instead Nathan Daniel Johnson, who was originally intended to serve as a placeholder candidate, appeared on the ballot alongside McMullin. While McMullin was not on enough state ballots to win an outright majority in the Electoral College (barring carrying other states by write-in), had he carried any state he could theoretically have prevented any candidate from amassing the 270 votes necessary to win the presidency. In that event, the United States House of Representatives would meet to elect the President, and would be bound to choose from the top three presidential candidates in terms of electoral votes. Barring another third-party candidate taking more electoral votes or an organized bloc of faithless electors larger than McMullin's choosing another candidate, the House would presumably have been bound to choose between Clinton, Trump and McMullin. =Ballot access= 2016 presidential election Although the filing deadline to get onto the ballot had passed in multiple states by the time McMullin announced his campaign he stated that he hoped he could appear on the ballot in all fifty states. He submitted around 2,000 signatures in Utah and 1,083 were validated, more than the 1,000 required. McMullin failed to appear on the ballot in Tennessee as he only collected 129 of the 275 signatures required. He failed to appear on the ballot in Wyoming after submitting 5,500 signatures, but less than the 3,302 signatures required was validated. McMullin threatened to sue Texas over its May petition deadline, but did not. Texas election officials initially sent a letter to McMullin telling him that he was not certified as a write-in candidate, but the Secretary of State of Texas later reversed his decision and allowed McMullin as a write-in candidate. Better for America successfully petitioned for the purpose of the presidential election in Arkansas and received official party status in New Mexico. On August 22, Better for America announced that it would end its ballot access petitioning and later selected to give its presidential nomination to McMullin and vice-presidential nomination to Nathan Johnson on August 24. The Independence Party of Minnesota selected to give its presidential nomination to McMullin and petitioned to appear on the ballot as \\"Independence\\". McMullin was given the presidential nomination of the ballot qualifed Independent Party of Florida, but the Secretary of State of Florida refused to place him onto the ballot on the grounds that the party wasn't recognized by the Federal Election Commission or affiliated with a national party. He also received the presidential nomination of the Independence Party of South Carolina. McMullin filed in Louisiana under the party label \\"Courage Character Service\\". Ballot access: a combined total of 84 electoral votes in these states: Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia Write-in: a combined total of 366 electoral votes in these states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming Results McMullin received no votes from the Electoral College. In the national popular vote count he placed fifth with 732,273 votes (0.53%). Of those 732,273 votes 510,002 votes came from states he appeared on the ballot in while he received 221,267 write-in votes. He broke write-in vote records in Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. McMullin received votes from at least three sitting United States Senators: Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, and Mike Lee. Endorsements Polling In late August 2016, polling nationwide and in most states placed McMullin in the 1-2% range. Late October polls in Idaho showed McMullin with about 10% of the vote, while during the same period in Utah polls showed him with between 20% and 30% of the vote.

Roy clocked 11.85 seconds in a 100-meter dash at the 51st National Open Athletics Championships, held at the Yuva Bharti Krirangan, Kolkata in 2011. Roy's record was just short of the national record of 11.38 seconds, which was set by Rachita Mistry in Thiruvananthapuram in 2000. Roy also ran the fastest 200-meter dash, clocking the tape at 24.36 seconds and anchored Bengal's 4 √ó 100 m relay team, which won the silver with a timing of 47.49 seconds at the Championships.  Early life  Roy was born in Ghanshyampur, a village in the Hooghly district of the Indian State of West Bengal, on 5 January 1990, to Bholanath Roy, a door-to-door vegetable-seller, and Bulu Roy, a homemaker. Roy is the third among four daughters of Bholanath Roy and Bulu Roy. The Roy family lives in abject poverty and the sprinter usually was only able to eat two meals a day, with little attention to the kind of nutrition the top athletes need. Roy studied for her bachelor's degree at the Sriampore College of the Hooghly district. Roy was promised a job and monetary assistance after her performance at the National Open Meet by both, the Indian Railways and the State Government of West Bengal.

They produced devotional pictures for the local bourgeoisie in a style reminiscent of contemporary Flemish painters working in an Italianate style.Th√©r√®se Poilvache-Lambert, Une vierge et enfant dans un paysage, attribution √† un artiste de l‚Äôentourage de Pieter Coeck, le Ma√Ætre au Perroquet, in: Revue des Arch√©ologues et Historiens d‚Äôart de Louvain, 17, 1984, p. 118‚Äì142 Discovery and background The scholar of Flemish painting Max Friedl√§nder was the first to group a set of 15 homogenous works and attribute them to an unknown artist whom he gave the notname 'Der Meister mit dem Papagei' ('Master with the Parrot') in an article, which appeared in 1948-49.Max J. Friedl√§nder, Der Meister mit dem Papagei. In: Phoebus, 2.1948/49, p 49-54 Friedlander gave the name because the common factor of the works he gave to the painter was their depiction of the Virgin with the Christ child often together with an idiosyncratic, exotic bird.The Master of the Parrot (active Antwerp 1525-1550), Saint Mary Magdalene before a curtain supported by angels in an architectural niche at Christie's Gradually more works were assigned to this master until there were about 100 works. Later research led to a new hypothesis about the attribution of the body of work: rather than a single individual painter, it is now surmised that because of the differences in style the works were the product of a workshop with several artists. St Luke writing There is no certainty about the exact period during which the Master with the Parrot was active. It must have been in the first half of the 16th century and probably during the 1520s and 1530s. It is generally believed that the workshop was based in Antwerp but it is possible it was in fact located in Bruges. Work Most of the works attributed to the Master with the Parrot are portraits and religious compositions, especially of the Virgin with Child, playing with a parrot, as well as of Mary Magdalene and the suicide of Lucretia. Despite the uneven quality of the paintings attributed to the Master, a core body of work of a high quality has been assigned to him, which is distinguished by its uniform style and recurring motifs. The core work in this oeuvre is the Virgin and Child feeding a Parrot in the San Diego Museum of Art. The figures in the compositions are characterized by features such as long fingers and oval nails, a broad face and thin nose. These features are in line with the Mannerist taste for elegant body proportions that surpass reality.The Master of the Parrot (active Antwerp 1525-1550), Saint Mary Magdalene at Christie's Virgin and Child feeding a Parrot The Master of the Parrot's paintings betray the influence of the Italianate artists of the generation following Quentin Matsys and Bernard van Orley who worked in the Southern Netherlands. Similarities with the oeuvre of Pieter Coecke van Aelst are particularly apparent. Among the most distinguished Flemish painters of the 16th century, Pieter Coecke van Aelst became a master in Antwerp's Guild of Saint Luke in 1527 and maintained a large and productive workshop. It is likely the Master of the Parrot began his career in van Coecke's workshop. In fact, many of the works now given to the Master of the Parrot were formerly attributed to that artist. The Master with the Parrot's paintings betray also the influence of the Romanist artists active in the region such as Joos van Cleve, Ambrosius Benson and Jan Gossaert. From Gossaert the Master with the Parrot took the inspiration for various compositions of the Holy Family and the sculptural aspect of his figures. This is particularly clear in the Virgin and Child (Auctioned at Koller Z√ºrich, 2014-09-15 - 2014-09-20, lot 3008). The closeness to Benson indicates that the Master's workshop may have maintained contacts with the Bruges school of painting.Maestro del Papagayo at the Prado Museum From Joos van Cleve the Master borrowed the compositional scheme of placing the Virgin in an elaborate landscape with still life elements. He also used a sfumato technique reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci, which attests to the enduring Itailianate influence on his work.Master of the Parrot at Koller The Master's style also bears similarities to the works of the Master of the Female Half- Lengths and his works have in the past been attributed to that Master. St Mary Magdalene before a curtain supported by angels in an architectural niche Many of the Master with the Parrot's works were made for the export market, and given the then existing trade and political ties with Spain, many of them ended up in Spain. Many of the compositions are still found in Spanish collections such as the Prado, the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville and the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum and various private collections.D√≠az Mat√≠as Padr√≥n, Una tabla del Maestro del Papagayo desconocida del Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, in: Bolet√≠n de la Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, first half of 1986, no. 62 Notes  External links  * Flemish Renaissance painters People from Antwerp Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke Parrot ","title":"Master with the Parrot"},{"id":"51311353","title":"2016‚Äì17 UNC Wilmington Seahawks men's basketball team"},{"id":"51311355","text":"The Saint John d'El Rey Mining Company was a British mining company that operated in Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries. The company employed skilled miners from Cornwall and elsewhere in Britain in its gold mines in the state of Minas Gerais, and also employed black slaves. Background The Nova Lima and Rio Acima quadrangles to the east and southeast of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, were an important source of gold in the 19th and 20th centuries. The climate is subtropical, with average daytime temperatures ranging from and average rainfall about per year. The Rio das Velhas is the main river, running northward though the two quadrangles. The terrain is fairly rugged, with peaks rising to , just over above the river. Old gold washings from the colonial period are found along the Rio das Velhas. There are many small abandoned gold mines and explorations, some worked before the second half of the 19th century, often with no surviving records. The main settlements are Nova Lima, Sabar√°, Rio Acima and Raposos. History The Saint John d'El Rey Mining Company was established in Britain in April 1830 as a joint stock company. John Diston Powles served as the company's first chairman. It obtained a lease to work the S√£o Jo√£o del Rei mines in Minas Gerais from the owners, three British merchants and a German physician. In June and July 1830 a group of Cornish miners travelled to Brazil to work the mines. The venture ran into problems with low-grade ore and legal disputes, and was closed within two years. The company searched for other mining properties in the region, and bought the Morro Velho gold mine in 1834. The Morro Velho mine had been worked for perhaps 50 years before the Saint John Company acquired it, at first as an open pit operation. The company also bought the Raposos mines and other properties. Properties owned by the St. John del Rey Mining Co. included the Morro das Bicas mine just south of Raposos, the Bella Fama mine about southeast of Nova Lima, the Gaia, Faria and Gabirobas mines southwest of Hon√≥rio Bicalho, the Bicalho mine at Hon√≥rio Bicalho and the Urubu mine about south-southeast of Hon√≥rio Bicalho. In 1845 the company made an agreement with the Cata Branca company to rent 385 slaves for a period of 14 years. It said \\"all of the said Negroes... shall at the end of such term of fourteen years be and become absolutely free and emancipated.\\" When the term of fourteen years was completed in 1859 the clause was quietly forgotten. An 1879 report opened by saying, \\"One of the last acts of injustice and inhumanity which one would naturally expect from an enlightened and just people would be an illegal retention of freedmen in Slavery by Englishmen.\\" It went on to state that, \\"The S. Jo√£o d'El-Rei Mining Company has at this day, fully two hundred blacks in Slavery, who were made free and emancipated in the year 1859, by a contract made in 1845, to which this same Company was a party...\\". Soon after this the Brazilian authorities freed the slaves under pressure from local abolitionists. The case was one of the early events leading to full abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888. Mines Morro Velho around 1869 =Morro Velho= Morro Velho in 1907 The Morro Velho mine is in a low valley near Nova Lima, about from Belo Horizonte. The company invested significant amounts into improving infrastructure, and quickly increased production. The first dividends were paid in 1842. The company encouraged British miners to come to work in Brazil, and employed slaves until they were emancipated in the late 19th century. After the Gongo Soco mine closed in 1856 some of the Cornish miners found work in Brazilian mines operated by the Saint John d'El Rey Mining Company. The Cornish formed the majority of British miners at Morro Velho, numbering about 350 in the 1860s. A fire caused the mine to collapse in 1867, and it took seven years to bring it back into operation. In the 1870s the superintendent was found to be engaged in fraud and had to be fired. A rock fall in 1886 caused the mine to collapse again, and the company went into temporary liquidation. The mine was reopened and again became profitable in the 1890s. At one time the Morro Velho mine was the deepest in the world, as below the entrance adit. After the revolution of 1930 a miner's union was formed. Strikes reduced production and the infrastructure fell into disrepair. =Raposos mines= Systematic exploration of the area around the Raposos mines to the east of Morro Velho seems to have started shortly before 1910. By 1930 the main lodes that had been discovered were the Mina Grande and Espirito Santo lodes, both west of the das Velhas River, and the Morro das Bicas lode about south of Raposas on the east of the Rio das Velhas. 23,404 tons of ore were extracted from the Raposos mines between 1910 and 1928, from which of gold were extracted. Mining at the Morro das Bicas was suspended in the early 1930s but continued at the other mines, which were important producers. As of 1955 the main lodes were the Espiritu Santo, Mina Grande and Espiritu West, which were connected by underground workings and had reached a depth of about . At the end of 1955 the Raposos mines had total reserves of 1,694,080 metric tons of ore with an average of 9.5 grams of gold per ton. =Other mines= The company drove an exploration adit in the Bicalho mine in 1925, and seems to have opened a lode before halting operations. In 1936 the mine was pumped out and exploration continued to a depth of . 36,800 tons of ore gave 8,238 ounces of gold in 1940‚Äì41, and 40,700 tons of ore was processed in 1942‚Äì43. There was no activity in 1944-45, 200 tons extracted in 1946, after which operations stopped. The company bought the Fernan Paes estate to the west of Honorio Bicalho around 1863 and began working the Gaia and Gabirobas mines. 5,777 ounces of gold were produced between 1867 and 1873, after which mining halted. Some exploration was resuming in 1887 after the Morro Velho mine collapsed, but results were discouraging. The Faria mine, about south of the Gabirobas mine, was developed and worked by a French company for a short period around 1900. The Saint John Company began to pump out and explore this mine in 1931. The company started to drive an adit known locally as the Gaia tunnel from the west side of the Rio das Velhas at Honorio Bicalho in 1934, running in a west-southwest direction. It was meant to unwater the old Gaia mine and provide access to deeper levels of that mine. In 1935 the adit was extended further to the west-southwest, and reached the foot of the Faria mine in 1936. The Gabirobas mine was pumped out in 1936 and explored for below the original workings, and the Gaia mines was explored to below the Gaia tunnel. There explorations were stopped in 1937 due to the low price of gold. The company continued to develop the Faria mine, and began regular production in 1940. Between 1940 and 1947, when production was suspended, 176,286 tons of ore were milled. Dissolution As of 1957 there were two active mines, the Morro Velho mine at Nova Lima and the Raposos group near Raposos. That year a group of investors bought a controlling interest in the company and sold its iron properties to the Hanna Mining Company of Cleveland, Ohio. The company was formally closed in 1985.

Life In 1893, at the age of sixteen, he took over the management of his family's failing business, the Ferriere di Terni, after his father's suicide. Despite inheriting a company plagued by large amounts of debt, liabilities, and interests, his managerial skills allowed him to navigate these financial difficulties. He was eventually able to repay his debts and make the company a success. After graduating from university in 1900 with a degree in civil engineering, he directed the Ferrotaie society, and also founded the trading company Sinigaglia-Di Porto. In 1908, in the aftermath of the 1908 Messina earthquake in Reggio Calabria and Messina, he took charge as a service engineer to work for earthquake victims. In 1915, at the beginning of Italy's entrance into World War I, he sold his large and successful steelworks business Alti Forni e Acciaierie d'Italia (today a successful steel company, Gruppo Riva). =Army service= After selling his company, he entered the Italian Army as volunteer. During his service in the Italian Army, he earned a silver medal and two bronze medals for bravery. Starting in November 1917, he was Aide-de-camp of Armando Diaz as Chief of Staff of the Italian Army. In 1918, at the end of the First World War he supported the cause of Italian Fiume, becoming a Nationalist leader and one of the first members of the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento. =Marriage= In 1919, he was next to his future father-in-law in provision of capital necessary to refound \\"Il Piccolo\\" which was destroyed in a fire set by a pro- Austrian in the evening of 23 May 1915. Sinigaglia later married Mayer's daughter, Marcella, in 1926. Thanks to his intervention, the Trieste newspaper returned to print in 20 November 1919. Sinigaglia remained on the board of directors of the company publishing until 1927. During this time he worked for the Italian Ministry of Arms and Ammunition before moving to the head of the ' and connected it to the Banca Commerciale Italiana; he conferred the same credit institution all of its state holdings, including the package of Ilva control. Sinigaglia also worked with Ernesto Manuelli and Agostino Rocca, persons with great influence on the subsequent developments of the Italian steel industry. =1930s= From 1932 to 1935 he worked directly in Ilva, first as a trustee of Sofindit and then as president. The Roman industrial community expressed Sinigaglia's views of Ilva leadership; in his opinion it was too engaged in personal profit at the expense of the production of wealth, and profit for the community. This made it poorly competitive and did not allow it to hire workers, often forced to emigrate. The reasons for his resignation, remain unclear, perhaps due to 'escalation of conflict with the leadership of Ilva, which made leverage racial motivation for the removal of a president by the \\"revolutionary\\" ideas. Later he held various positions in the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale as a technical trust. In 1938 as Jew he was ousted from the Italian public life as a result of the Italian Racial Laws. During World War II, he fled with his wife Marcella to Abruzzo, where he converted to Catholicism. After the war, he joined the Christian Democracy (Italy) and became a friend of Alcide De Gasperi. =After WWII= Possibly because of a vow made during WWII, he ceded to the Vatican a Centrifugal casting (industrial) company he owned. In 1945 he became the first commissioner and later the president of , of which he was in charge of until his death in 1953. During his time as president of Finsider, he oversaw and coordinated the financial Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale steel activities. In this capacity, Sinigaglia vigorously rejected the idea that Italy renounced its heavy idea (?) and started the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Italian steel industry, better known as \\"Sinigaglia plan\\", approved by the Italian government in 1948. By 1948 there were three well-built steel mills in Italy: one in Genoa-Cornigliano (then entitled to his name), to Bagnoli and Piombino. The concentration of production in large and modern factories allowed for the alignment of the Italian iron and steel costs to that of the international steel industries. This consequently had a positive impact on the development of various industries. =Awards= In 1952 he was awarded with the Order of Merit for Labour. In 1955 was built a vessel bulk carrier, Oscar Sinigaglia, with a gross tonnage of 11249.

The building is famous for having been frequented by Alfred Hitchcock during its time as a cinema. It was built on a site where films were shown as early as 1896. History The building in its incarnation as the Granada - lit up with neon signs In 1930 Granada plc built a 2,697 seat cinema, opened as The Granada. The building featured exteriors by Cecil Masey and interior decorations by Theodore Komisarjevsky. In later years, as a result of changes in the building's ownership, the cinema was variously known as MGM, ABC, and EMD cinema. Although never completely renovated after the 1970s, at the time of its closure as a cinema in December 2003, it was the only cinema to have an original working Christie Organ still in place at the cinema where it was originally installed. Often used as a concert venue, the Granada cinema in Hoe Street, Walthamstow held a concert by the Beatles on May 24 1963. Other famous musical acts to have performed there include John Coltrane, Little Richard, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis, Alex Paterson and Buddy Holly,  Campaign to save building and cinema  The building, boarded up, during the period of closure. The cinema closed in 2003 and was purchased by Universal Church of the Kingdom of God (UCKG) with the intention of converting the building into a church. Many members of the local community opposed and successfully campaigned against these plans. Comedian and presenter Griff Rhys Jones, actor Paul McGann and writer Alain de Botton are among the famous names to have backed local residents in asking the local authority to stop plans to convert the building into a church. The Waltham Forest Film Society and Campaign to save our cinema McGuffin, was the focal point for local campaigners. UCKG failed to gain planning permission to convert the building from Waltham Forest Council and later from the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles. Re-opening of building 2015 In 2014, UCKG sold the cinema to pub company Antic who re-opened the building as, under the new name of Mirth, Marvel and Maud. When asked about the new name, Anthony Thomas, the head of Antic said: In May 2019 Waltham Forest Council purchased the building from Antic. Waltham Forest Council and Soho Theatre have teamed up to secure the future of the former EMD cinema which will operate a new local theatre with a national profile as part of the legacy of Waltham Forest‚Äôs year as the first London Borough of Culture. Soho Theatre will operate the building as a new cultural venue for North East London. The 1000-seat rejuvenated venue will operate as a local theatre with a national profile, presenting the biggest names in comedy plus theatre, performance, music, pantomime and community and education programmes. Renovation of the site is being carried out by Willmott Dixon Interiors and is estimated to take around three years to complete, and initial plans suggest that events could be held on the site before the project is complete. A fund of ¬£17million has been set aside for the work, which is expected to start in May 2020. The current businesses operating from the EMD Cinema will close when the renovation begins. The Antic operated pub finally shut its doors after close of business on 4 January 2020.

Sana loved riding bikes since seventh grade. Born in a liberal Muslim family, she was raised with values which emphasised on humanity and purity of heart. An avid biker, a dedicated training professional and a student of Psychology made her eligible to execute the 'rarely thought about aspect of society'.  Response to depression  She attempted suicide through a bike accident. At age 27, she biked to Gujarat with a death wish to be rammed by a bus or truck. The journey made her realize that peace can be attained by peace. Later she decided to use a journey to give purpose to her suffering. Her fight against her depression led her to become a hero for many youth. She gave workshops on awareness that \\"Suicide is not the solution\\". In her workshop she talked on matters that trouble young minds: matters as innocuous as acne to relationships, career, marriage, depression and suicide. She also used to manage a facebook page named Suicide is not the solution with the help of her close friend and the current owner of the face book page, Arif Ali Mohammed. The Facebook page currently has 12000+ followers and Arif is trying to continue to spread the message Sana left him with.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Azerbaijan. It has narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves, medium-sized stem and large flowers, where the flower colour is very variable (especially in the wild), ranging from violet, purple, pale blue, and also yellow, and occasionally bi- colour forms are found. It has a yellow beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, due to its environmental conditions of its natural habitat. Description It has a small, red rhizome, which is about 1 cm long, and medium thick.British Iris Society (1997) Underneath the rhizome are long secondary roots. The rhizome and roots make a creeping plant. It has narrow, falcate (sickle-shaped), leaves, that can grow up to between long. They begin to grow in late November and fade after summer, when the plant becomes dormant. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The stem has 3 acute, carinate (ridged or keeled), lanceolate, (scarious) membranous, spathes (leaves of the flower bud). It also has long pedicels and a perianth tube which is longer than the ovary. The stems hold 1 terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in spring, in April. The flower is similar in form to an Iris pallida flower. The flowers are in diameter, come in various colours, from violet, purple to pale blue, and also yellow, and occasionally bi-colour forms are found. Up to 16 colour forms or hybrids, have been found and noted. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are broadly obovate, deflexed (folded over) and slightly narrowed at apex, or slightly spoon-shaped. In purple shade forms, they have a violet, or dark purple signal patch. In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is yellow, The erect, standards are broader, or larger than the falls, They are also a similar colour to the falls, but they can be slightly paler than the falls. It has style branches that are recurved and shorter than the falls. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule, which has not yet been described. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. In 1977, 47 species of the irises in the Oncocyclus section were analysed, and it was found to have a chromosome count of 2n=20. Taxonomy It is commonly known as Kamilla's iris. It is sometimes called Iris camilla. It has not been recorded what the Latin specific epithet camillae actually refers to/ It was first collected on 29 April 1928, by A. Kolakovsky in Transcaucasia, Azerbajdzhan. It was then first published and described by Alexander Alfonsovich Grossheim in Schedae ad Herbarium Plantae orientales exsiccatae (Sched. Herb. Pl. Or. Exsicc.) Vol.15 on page 40 in 1928. Which was edited by B. K. Schischkin, in Tiflis.Thomas Gaskell Tuti (Editor) It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003 and then updated on 2 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life. Iris camillae is an accepted name by the RHS. Although, it has discussed by the British Iris Society and D. Kramb (of the Species Iris Group of North America), that it may have a hybrid origin between Iris iberica, Iris paradoxa, and Iris acutiloba, but this has not yet been proved. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. =Range= It is endemic, to the Transcaucasian region, within the country of Azerbaijan, in the districts of Kazakh, Tauz and Khokali. Including around Lake Kazan-Gel, or Qazang√∂l Lake in the Caucasus, on the river Kura. =Habitat= It grows on the rocky, or stony, dry steppes. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Conservation Iris camillae is a threatened wild plant, and was in 1989 listed in the Red Data Book of Azerbaijan, which helps with its protection. It was re-assessed by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) on 11 October 2006, as vulnerable, as it is only known 4 sites, with a limited population range of about 50 km2. It is threatened due to over-collection of the flowers, for ornamental uses. Cultivation It is not hardy enough, to be grown outdoors, it should be grown in a bulb frame or greenhouse. It is recommended to be planted late in Autumn, with dolomite and limestone chippings within the soil mix. It also needs feeding when in growth. It needs to be grown in full sun. It was tested for growth in Leningrad Botanic Garden, in Russia. A herbarium specimen is found within Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, and plants are grown in the Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske References Sources * Czerepanov, S. K.

Rutherford has been described as \\"one of the prettiest of old time fiddlers, and he could sing too\\" Russell p 92 and \\"a versatile, long bow fiddler with an exceptionally sweet tone and a repertoire that included modern songs and tunes, as well as old-time tunes\\".Titon p. 214 Dick Burnett's verdict was more mixed: \\"He could play that fiddle, he was the best in the world, but he wouldn't do nothin' else. You've got to have showmanship.\\"quoted in Russell (2007). Burnett and Rutherford When Leonard was a boy the Rutherford family moves from Somerset to Monticello, the home of the blind professional touring musician Dick Burnett. In 1914, when Rutherford was 14 and Burnett 31 (date and ages approximate), the older man asked for the teenager to accompany him as a sighted assistant to the nearby Lauren County Fair. Thereafter, Rutherford accompanied Burnett on more (and more distant) trips, becoming a permanent companion after the deaths of his parents. A multi-instrumentalist, Burnett taught young Leonard to play the fiddle, while himself playing banjo and sometimes guitar. As Rutherford improved, it became profitable to range further afield by horse bus and railroad. Eventually Burnett bought a car, which Rutherford learned to drive, thus allowing them to travel in Burnett's words \\"from Cincinnati to Chattanooga\\" playing \\"every town this side of Nashville\\".Wolfe, Charles (1975), Sleeve notes to the LP Rounder 1004, A Ramblin' Reckless Hobo, The Songs of Dick Burnett and Leonard Rutherford In Bonny Blue Coal Camp, Virginia, they encountered a general store owner specializing in phonograph records, who recommended them to Columbia Records. The A&R; manager Frank Walker was impressed by their sound and repertoire, exclaiming \\"I've had a heap of people recording for me here, but you two fellers are the two smoothest musicians that I ever had record for me.\\" and \\"You have some of the tantalizingest names for these records that I ever listened at.\\"Russell 2007 Six sides were recorded in 1926 and issued in the Columbia 1500-D Familiar Tunes Series. They sold well, encouraging Walker to concentrate more on native Southern artists. Burnett and Rutherford were invited to record six months later and again after another six months. The records are notable for the precise unison melodic line of Rutherford's fiddle and Burnett's banjo or guitar. One of the songs, the ballad \\"Willie Moore\\" was included in the 1952 Anthology of American Folk Music, introducing Burnett and Rutherford to the new market of the American folk music revival. In 1928, after a dispute over royalties, Burnett and Rutherford left Columbia to record four sides for Gennett with the addition of the guitarist Byrd Moore.Wolfe (1975) Rutherford and Foster From 1929, Burnett and Rutherford each recorded with other artists. Charles Wolfe speculates that Rutherford's free lifestyle may have created fatherlike disapproval and tension. His new partner, John D Foster, claimed later that Gennett had considered Burnett and Moore too \\"harsh\\" an accompaniment to Rutherford's smooth fiddle.Russell (2007) What is known as fact is that in 1928 Rutherford made a number of sides with Moore alone accompanying, and that all but one were rejected or unissued.Russell, Tony (2004), Country Music record, a Discography, 1921-1945, Oxford University Press . In 1929, Foster was summoned to meet Rutherford at Somerset. After intensive practice of their shared repertoire, a recording partnership was formed which lasted for almost two years. Rutherford and Foster recorded five sessions for Gennett in 1929-1930. One of their sides \\"Six Months Ain't Long\\" was half of the biggest selling old-time record of the time. But all the sides from their last two sessions were rejected, possibly because of a dispute with the musicians' manager. Rutherford and Foster recorded for Brunswick in 1930 but broke up because of Leonard's epileptic fits. Despite his condition, he continued to perform with Dick Burnett until 1950 when he was too ill to continue. Leonard Rutherford died in 1954 and was buried in Somerset.

Sports which incorporate a degree of difficulty in scoring include bouldering, cross- country skiing, diving, equestrianism, figure skating, freestyle skiing, gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, surfing, synchronized swimming and trampoline. Degree of difficulty is typically intended to be an objective measure, in sports whose scoring may also rely on subjective judgments of performance. By sport =Diving= The International Swimming Federation computes the degree of difficulty of dives according to a five-part formula, incorporating height, number of somersaults and twists, positioning, approach, and entry. =Figure skating= =Gridiron football= In American football, kicking a field goal is worth three points regardless of the distance from which it is kicked; however, the distance plays into the likelihood that a field goal is successfully scored. For instance, from 30 yards out, there is roughly a 95% chance of success, compared to 65% from 50 yards. In fantasy football, the degree of difficulty for a field goal factors into scoring, by awarding more points for longer field goals: 3 points for 17-39 yards; 4 points for 40-49 yards; 5 points for 50-59 yards; and 6 points for 60 or more yards. =Gymnastics= The International Federation of Gymnastics gives skills a difficulty rating of A, B, C, D, E, F, or G. Degree of difficulty is also enhanced by connecting skills together in combination. =Trampoline= The International Federation of Gymnastics gives difficulty points for number of somersaults, number of body twists and the body position in somersaults (piked or straight). The total for a routine is the sum of the individual elements: * Each 1/4 rotation of a somersault = 0.1 DD * Completed 360¬∞ somersault (bonus) = 0.1 DD * Each 1/2 twist = 0.1 DD * Single somersaults without twist in pike/straight position = 0.1 DD * Somersaults over 720¬∞ in pike/straight position = 0.2 DD =Other sports= *Grade (bouldering) *Grade (climbing) *International Scale of River Difficulty See also *Adjudicator *Balance (game design) ¬ß Difficulty level *Element (sports) *Referee *Umpire References Broad-concept articles Terminology used in multiple sports Sports rules and regulations Sports articles needing expert attention Gymnastics articles needing expert attention Water sports articles needing expert attention ","title":"Degree of difficulty"},{"id":"51311713","title":"Matthew Denny"},{"id":"51311717","text":"FC Germanea () is a Bulgarian football club based in Sapareva Banya.

She began as a soloist in 1933 on radio in Atlanta, then, beginning 1936, was carried on syndicated and network radio from New York City. In the first half of the 1940s, Duke traveled and recorded as a featured singer with big bands, notably with Vaughn Monroe. She distinguished herself as a rhythm singer ‚Äì that is, a singer who swings. And, while with the Monroe Orchestra, she was acclaimed for having an engaging personalty. Duke was a tall brunette, and, according to journalists, attractive. As for her hair color, Duke was a blonde when she re-joined Monroe's band in 1944. After her career with big bands ‚Äì after 1945 ‚Äì and into the late 1960s, she performed on-and-off as a nightclub pianist-singer in the metropolitan areas of Boston, New York City, and Newport, Rhode Island. Her recorded hits with Vaughn Monroe include \\"There'll Be Some Changes Made\\" and \\"The Trolley Song\\" ‚Äî the latter being a late-1944, post-Petrillo-ban, rush-to- market, swing band vocal duet with Monroe.  Career highlights  =Growing up= Marilyn Duke learned to sing in a choir at her church, likely the Macedonia Baptist Church in Jackson, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. Though, according to a 1995 interview (the year she died) in the Atlanta Constitution, at an early age, she preferred the gospel music of a nearby black church. =Atlanta radio career= In 1933, under the product brand pseudonym of \\"Miss Seiberling,\\" Duke performed on broadcast radio WGST, Wednesdays, 7:15 pm. The radio name was that of the Seiberling Rubber Company, a national tire manufacturer distributed by the Brooks-Shatterly Company, Inc., of Atlanta. In 1934, Duke, under her birth name, Manfrey Duke, sang regularly on WSB radio in Atlanta. =New York radio career= After winning a radio audition contest around 1934, Duke headed to New York City, where, from December 30, 1934, to 1936 (and later), she sang regularly on NBC radio and the Mutual Broadcasting Company. She was billed as a blues singer and contralto. Her radio broadcasts included performances with the orchestras of Leon Brusiloff (1898‚Äì1973) and his brother Nathan Brusiloff (1904‚Äì1951) and Paul Whiteman. In 1935, her broadcast performances were sometimes with The Charioteers, a male choral quartet. Beginning December 30, 1934, Duke sang on WOR two or three times a week ‚Äì typically Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at 5:15 pm. She sang 15-minute segments, usually. The WOR broadcasts were carried on the Mutual Network. =Early dance orchestra career= From Mid to late-1930s, Duke, as vocalist, was the star attraction for Manny Gates (n√© Emanuel Getzholtz; 1894‚Äì1957) Orchestra in Miami She joined Jolly Coburn's (n√© Frank Harry Coburn; 1900‚Äì1964) Orchestra, a society band, around July 1937 after playing a piano stint at a Boston nightclub. Duke also sang with the Shep Fields Orchestra in 1937 (in Philadelphia). =Joined Vaughn Monroe's Orchestra in 1940= On New Year's Eve 1940‚Äîat age twenty-four‚Äî after the death of her father‚ÄîDuke debuted with the Vaughn Monroe Orchestra at the Statler Hotel Boston, eight months after Monroe founded the Orchestra. Her father died January 8, 1940, of injuries as a pedestrian struck by a truck. Monroe formed his orchestra April 1940 in Miami at the urging and sponsorship of band agent Willard Alexander (1908‚Äì1984) and New England-based band leader Jack Marshard (n√© Jacob Marshard; 1910‚Äì1948), who saw an opportunity when offered two simultaneous bookings. Marshard became his manager. Marylin Duke was Monroe's first female vocalist. She had been working as a pianist-singer at a Boston nightclub; but because an infected finger interrupted her playing, she auditioned for Vaughn Monroe and was promptly signed. Her notoriety rose rapidly during her tenure with Vaughn Monroe and his Orchestra as a featured singer. = Departure from Vaughn Monroe's Orchestra in 1943= She left the Monroe Orchestra in around June 1943 to join the WAAC, but instead, continued performing, which included a two-month stint with Tommy Dorsey. That same year (1943), Duke also sang with Will Osborne and His Orchestra. Filling the void, Monroe hired Phyllis Lynne July 31, 1943, in Los Angeles, to replace Duke. Monroe gave Lynne her East Coast debut on September 14, 1943, in New York City at the Paramount. = Rejoined Vaughn Monroe's Orchestra in 1944= Around June 1944, Duke began a 10-week solo engagement at the Frolic Club (aka, the Frolic Theatre Restaurant), in Revere, Massachusetts, at 155 Revere Beach Boulevard. But, apparently before finishing, she was back with Vaughn Monroe by mid-July 1944, replacing Del Parker. In September 1944, she married Peter O'Brien, a Boston amusement park owner. She then permanently left the orchestra around January 1945. Yet, on April 14, 1945, Vaughn Monroe and His Orchestra featured Duke, with Bobby Ricky, in Dayton, Ohio, at the Lakeside Park Ballroom. A large part of Vaughn Monroe's repertoire featured the singing of Monroe, himself, as well as Marilyn Duke, Ziggy Talent, The Murphy Sisters, and The Moonmaids. =On and off solo career= In December 1945, she was performing at the Music Box in Boston.  Popularity  =Polls= * 1942: Billboard's \\"Collegiate Choice of Female Vocalists,\\" Duke received votes for first and second choice. * April 12, 1942: A swing magazine presented Marilyn Duke with an award during Vaughn Monroe's final performance, after a long engagement, at the Commodore Hotel in New York * The February 1942 issue of Big Song Magazine, Vol. 2, No. 2 (), Vaughn Monroe, Marilyn Duke, and Sammy Kaye were on the cover. * In January 1945, Duke's rendition of \\"The Trolley Song,\\" became a top-ten hit. That song, and the one on the flip side, \\"The Very Thought of You,\\" were recorded Sunday, November 12, 1944, at Victor's studio in New York, 18 hours after the 27-month Petrillo Ban had been lifted. The session represented Victor's first since the ban. Both songs were pressed and on sale only 24 hours later. Victor Victor distributed 160,000 copies throughout the country before the week was out. {|width=\\"100%\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border:0px solid #A3B1BF; color: black; background- color:white;\\" |- style=\\"vertical-align:bottom;

Proficient in music and languages as well as art history, Comini brought an interdisciplinary approach to her study of the arts in Austria and Germany at the turn of the 20th century, an approach particularly suited to the integrated art forms of fin-de-si√®cle Vienna. Early and personal life Alessandra Comini was born the daughter of Megan Laird and Raiberto Comini in Winona, Minnesota. Her earliest years were spent in Barcelona, Milan, and Dallas. Comini received her B.A. from Barnard College (1956), her M.A, from the University of California, Berkeley (1964), and her Ph.D. from Columbia University (1969). Her dissertation, written under Theodore Reff, on the topic of Egon Schiele's portraiture. In 1974 she started working with art historian Eleanor Tufts at Southern Methodist University.

And she guest taught at the University of California, Berkeley (1967) and Yale University (1973). Voted outstanding professor sixteen times by her students, Comini served as the Alfred Hodder Resident Humanist at Princeton University (1972‚Äì1973) and was named Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at Oxford University's European Humanities Research Centre (1996). Celebrated for her witty, erudite, and compelling public lectures, Comini has been in demand as a guest speaker nationally and internationally. As an interdisciplinary speaker, Comini lectured repeatedly at the Leipzig Gewandhaus symposia, The Santa Fe Opera, and for the Indianapolis and Dallas Symphony Orchestras. In 1990 Comini was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria in recognition of her contributions to Germanic culture. In 2014 Comini turned to fiction writing and published six art history murder mystery novels in the Megan Crespi Series.Killing for Klimt : a Megan Crespi mystery novel, Santa Fe, Sunstone Press, 2014.

His best-known invention was an electronic keyboard instrument called the Ondioline (sometimes referred to as the Jenny Ondioline). It is considered a forerunner of the Synthesizer. The Ondioline is capable of making an array of sounds, and features a keyboard that produces a natural-sounding vibrato with side-to-side finger movements while depressing keys.\\"Inventor Georges Jenny Demos The Ondioline (1948),\\" at Synthtopia.com Career Jenny conceived the instrument as a low-cost alternative to the then-well known but expensive Ondes Martenot. The Martenot was used in serious music, but Jenny planned the Ondioline for a broader consumer market, including pop music. He began constructing the Ondioline around 1938, and when he started to commercially manufacture it in 1947,\\"The ‚ÄòOndioline,‚Äô Georges Jenny, France, 1940,\\" at 120 Years of Electronic Music it was valve-based and contained a built-in amplifier.\\"1950s French Monosynth,\\" at Sonicouture.com Like the Martenot, it had a lateral vibrato keyboard and a knee-lever to control volume. For decades Jenny redesigned and manufactured new versions of the instrument at his Paris company, Les Ondes Georges Jenny (later known as La Musique Electronique). Jenny built the instruments by hand, but also packaged and sold the parts as a do-it-yourself assembly kit. He never licensed the instrument for mass production. Jenny gave public demonstrations of the instrument on radio and in newsreels.Jenny Demonstrating the Ondioline in a trio setting, German newsreel, 1948, YouTube The number of Ondiolines that were built and sold is unknown, with estimates ranging from 600 to over 1,000. To reduce manufacturing costs and keep retail prices affordable, Jenny often used poor quality components; as a result, the instruments required regular maintenance or they would become unplayable.120 Years of Electronic Music, ibid. Perrey popularizes the instrument The instrument was introduced to a wider audience in the 1950s by electronic music pioneer Jean- Jacques Perrey (who was also an early adopter of the Moog synthesizer). In 1951 (some sources cite 1949 or 1952), Perrey, at the time a medical student, heard Jenny demonstrate the Ondioline on a French radio broadcast. \\"With the audacity of youth he phoned the radio station and requested Georges Jenny's telephone number, which he was duly given,\\" wrote historian Mark Brend. \\"Perrey then phoned Jenny himself, saying he liked the sound of the Ondioline but couldn't afford to buy one.\\"Brend, Mark, The Sound of Tomorrow: How Electronic Music was Smuggled into the Mainstream, Bloomsbury Academic, 2012 Perrey offered to promote the instrument if Jenny would give him one for free. After a visit to the inventor's workshop, Perrey was loaned an Ondioline. For six months Perrey practiced playing the Ondioline with his right hand while simultaneously playing piano with his left. Jenny was so impressed with Perrey's proficiency, he offered him a job as a salesman and product demonstrator. After earning substantial commissions on sales made during a trip to Sweden (during which he performed on TV), Perrey quit medical school and devoted his career to electronic music. Perrey procured so many orders for Ondiolines during the 1950s that Jenny finally had to open a factory. In the 1960s, Perrey continued to promote the instrument, touring, performing and recording under the playful pseudonym \\"Mr. Ondioline.\\"Jean-Jacques Perrey (as \\"Mr. Ondioline\\") plays \\"Le siffleur et son chien\\" (\\"The Whistler and His Dog\\"), YouTube Perrey estimated that \\"fewer than 700 were sold, mostly in Europe.\\"Ondioline.com, established by Dana Countryman By some estimates, fewer than two dozen Jenny-made Ondiolines exist today. Gotye and the Ondioline Since 2016 the instrument has been championed by Australian pop star Wally (Gotye) De Backer, who acquired a number of vintage Ondiolines and began performing concerts with his Ondioline Orchestra in November of that year. In a 2018 interview with Australia's Broadsheet, De Backer said, ‚ÄúYou can dial in an incredibly wide range of sounds on the ondioline, and the unique mechanics for playing it allows you to create sounds very sensitively and with a musical deftness I just feel isn't present on most other electronic instruments from the '40s ‚Äì or decades since.\\"Preston, Sammy, \\"Gotye Makes His Return with an Ondioline.

In his later years he was known as Avi Berga (Grandpa Berga). Biography He was born to a family of peasant laborers. His early education came from two local monks and his first exposure to art probably came at the farmhouse owned by his parents' employer. The only way open to continue his education was by pursuing an ecclesiastical career so, in 1852, he went to Olot to attend the Latin school.\\"El fundador de l'Escola Paisatg√≠stica Olotina: Josep Berga i Boix\\" @ DUGiDocs, University of Girona While there, he was able to study drawing with a local artist named Narc√≠s Pascual i Sala (1805-1869). In 1855, he moved to Girona to continue his religious training at the seminary. He was there for six years without making a definite decision about entering the clergy. Along with his official studies, he took private lessons from , who had studied with Thomas Couture in Paris. When he left the seminary, he found work as a draftsman for the architect, .\\"Los Directores de la Escuela de Bellas Art√©s de Olot\\" @ Revistas Catalanes. The Romeria (1886) He became a regular contributor of illustrations for various periodicals, including '. As a result of some work he did for a Carlist newspaper, he was briefly forced to take refuge in Perpignan after the Revolution of 1868, where he met Joaquim Vayreda and was introduced to the Barbizon school of landscape painting. He also took this occasion to make sketches in the Pyrenees. Upon his return, he applied to be Director at the Drawing School of Olot, but was unsuccessful. He settled there, however, and worked with Vayreda to create a local style of painting, which showed the influence of Barbizon as well as the Norwich school. During the Third Carlist War, he had to go to France temporarily again. In 1877, he was finally named Director of the drawing school; a position that occupied most of his energies for the rest of his life. Among his best-known students there were Josep Clar√† and Miquel Blay i F√†bregas. In 1880, together with Vayreda and others, he created a special workshop for religious images; \\"Els Sants d'Olot\\", which gained an international reputation. Berga later quit in frustration over being unable to change the public's \\"bad taste\\" in regards to those types of images. \\"Els camins oberts per Berga i Boix\\" @ Revista de Girona. He was also an amateur writer. From 1893 to 1894, his semi-autobiographical narrative, \\"L'estudiant de la Garrotxa\\", was published as a serial in '. This was issued as a book in 1895, with illustrations by several artists from Olot. He later produced a sequel, a study of art in Olot, a play (\\"La Borda\\", 1902) and, towards the end of his life, a collection of stories; Llegendes de la comarca d'Olot. In 2000, the Olot Town Council added his portrait to the \\"Gallery of Illustrious Olotinos\\".

The weekly was edited by Louis Maximiliaan Hermans (who would later become a Member of Parliament and Senator), and was published from 1 August 1892 until 13 December 1897.Nop Maas, 'De Roode Duivel' in 'Satirische tijdschriften in Nederland', in: De Parelduiker 3 (1998), p. 33‚Äì39. On DBNL De Roode Duivel had a circulation of several thousands of copies. Hermans, who was initially a member of the revolutionary Social Democratic League, also used the magazine to criticise the parliamentarist Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP). Under the mottos of \\"Tegen troon, tegen beurs, tegen altaar\\" (Against throne, against bourse, against altar) and \\"Ontmaskering! Geen genade\\" (Exposure! No mercy), the magazine was filled with gossip and libellous stories to discredit the monarchy, capitalism and religion with satire. For example, Hermans invented the fabrication that not king William III, but adjutant S.M.S. de Ranitz was the real father of the then underage queen Wilhelmina. It was clear to contemporary readers that this was willfully made-up satire, and historians agree the story is false.Meulen, Dik van der; (2013) 'Koning Willem III 1817-1890', p. 616-618 (e-book) However, it has since taken a life on its own as a conspiracy theory, invoked by some republicans to question the current House of Orange-Nassau's legitimacy to rule. In the 30 August 1895 issue of De Roode Duivel, on the occasion of a royal visit to the town of Meppel, the queens Emma and Wilhelmina were depicted as gymnastic moves performing ballet dancers on a wagon. Although they were not named, both figures were wearing a litte crown with the letters W and E. The accompanying article featured the title: \\"Come and see!! Come and see!!\\" This led to a complaint against Hermans for l√®se-majest√©, and a demand by the public prosecutor for a one-year prison sentence; on 18 December 1895, the editor-in-chief was convicted to six months imprisonment.The public prosecutor in this lawsuit was mr. G.J.Ph. Count Schimmelpenninck (1851‚Äì1929), chamberlain of queen Wilhelmina and son of former minister mr. Rutger Jan Count Schimmelpenninck (1821‚Äì1893), Grand Master of the Royal House, chief chamberlain; two brothers of the public prosecutor were mr. F.D. Count Schimmelpenninck (1854‚Äì1924), chamberlain in extraordinary service of Wilhelmina and at the queen-mother's disposal, and Lodewijk Hieronymus Count Schimmelpenninck (1858‚Äì1942), steward of the royal domain. The court president who issued the verdict was mr. A. Wichers Hoeth (1840‚Äì1921). When he got out of prison, his return was celebrated at the Paleis voor Volksvlijt. Meanwhile, Hermans' views on tactics had been shifting. Whilst radicals such as Domela Nieuwenhuis became anarchists, Hermans followed the others of the Socialist League (more and more of whom were defecting to the SDAP) in gradually abandoning their antiparliamentarism. After investigating the living conditions in the Jewish neighbourhood of Amsterdam in 1897, Hermans stated he was prepared to run for office in local elections to change society by that means. On 13 December 1897, the final issue of De Roode Duivel was published. In early 1898, Hermans was acting as editor-in-chief (together with J.A. Bergmeijer) of Recht voor Allen (the Socialist League's party magazine) after Domela Nieuwenhuis' departure, but in December 1898 he also left the Socialist League to join the SDAP, that he had fought against so long in De Roode Duivel.

Rosen Professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. He is a noted scholar and expert on constitutional issues, particularly its historical underpinnings. Biography Magliocca received his B.A. degree from Stanford University and his J.D. degree from Yale University School of Law. He served for a year as a law clerk for Judge Guido Calabresi on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and then two years as an attorney at Covington & Burling. Thereafter, Magliocca joined the faculty at Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. Magliocca's first book, Andrew Jackson and the Constitution (University Press of Kansas, 2007), describes the differences in political and constitutional reinterpretations that arise when a new generation gains control of the government. Using the Jacksonian era as a model he contends that political and constitutional understandings are cyclical, based on roughly thirty-year intervals, suggesting that the U.S. Constitution is a living document. The book was the subject of an hour-long program on C-Span's Book TV. His second book, The Tragedy of William Jennings Bryan (Yale Univ. Press 2011), explores how William Jennings Bryan's campaigns for the presidency energized conservatives and transformed constitutional law by prompting a negative response to the populist agenda. Magliocca's third book, American Founding Son (NYU Press, 2013), focuses on John Bingham and his role in crafting the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Pushing back against many who tend to overlook Bingham, Magliocca argues he deserves to be remembered as one of America's great leaders. The book received critical praise, including from Laurie Levenson in the Los Angeles Review of Books, who wrote, \\"Professor Magliocca spares no detail in his comprehensive review of John Bingham‚Äôs life and his drafting of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\\" Magliocca's fourth book, The Heart of the Constitution (Oxford University Press, 2018), examines the Bill of Rights and portrays it as \\"a mirror for how America sees itself,\\" taking a different form \\"every political season.\\" He highlights the role of the Bill of Rights in distinguishing America during the 20th century from the totalitarian forces, its importance of its civil liberties during the Cold War, and its elevation over the past 150 years to achieve a more inclusive and egalitarian view of American society. A review in the Washington Post read, \\"the punchline of Magliocca's book is that our modern view of the Bill of Rights is far too stultifying. . . . as we face a new set of crises, from war to inequality to structural exclusion, a more dynamic debate over a 21st-century bill of rights might offer some avenues forward. Magliocca's book can help us start that debate.\\" The book also received critical praise from Kirkus Reviews and Allen Guelzo in the Wall Street Journal. Contributing to the anthology Our American Story (2019), Magliocca addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and focused on insights a foreigner's view of America may offer, in particular the Americans' \\"uncommon degree of political common sense.\\" In 2008 Magliocca held the Fulbright-Dow Distinguished Research Chair of the Roosevelt Study Center in Middelburg, The Netherlands. He was elected to the American Law Institute in 2013. He has received several awards for his teaching, including Best New Professor Award, the Black Cane (Most Outstanding Professor), and the Indiana University Trustees Teaching Award. Magliocca was named to the 2019‚Äì2020 class of fellows for the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon with a research topic of \\"Washington's Heir: The Life of Justice Bushrod Washington.\\" Magliocca is a frequent contributor to legal blogs Balkinization and Concurring Opinions. Much of his work set out in three books explores how major changes in American political and constitutional development occur generationally in roughly thirty-year intervals and move from dominant regime to the emergence of a counter-regime.

The 1832 tomb of the Stratford family is visible at right. The site of Baltinglass Abbey is beside the River Slaney in a valley of the Wicklow Mountains which was a strategic mountain pass between the north and south parts of Leinster. The original name Belach Conglais means \\"pass of C√∫ Glas,\\"https://edmooneyphoto.wordpress.com/tag/road-of-cuglas/ referring to a mythological hero that was killed by wild boars. The archaeology of the surroundings testifies to the strategic importance of Baltinglass from prehistory. In 1148, Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster, founded a monastery on the site, at least partially to extend his influence on the region. Baltinglass Abbey was established as a daughter house of Mellifont Abbey, a Cistercian abbey near Drogheda. Diarmait gave it the Latin name Vallis Sal≈´tis, meaning \\"Valley of Salvation\\", and granted it eight parcels of land in the region as an endowment. The first stage of building was completed by 1170, it became the mother house of Jerpoint Abbey in 1180 and in 1228 it is recorded that there were 36 monks and 50 lay brothers living at Baltinglass. The Abbey was occupied for nearly 400 years until it was shut down by the 1536 Dissolution of the Monasteries and granted to Edmond Butler, 3rd/13th Baron Dunboyne. A Church of Ireland church was built within the abbey itself in 1815, but it closed in 1883. Building The surviving church (56 m in length) and some of the cloister dates from the 12th century, consisting of the nave with aisles, chancel, square presbytery with three-light window and a pair of transepts from which small chapels project. The south aisle of the church is joined to the choir by a twelfth century doorway. Part of the original cloister, to the south of the church, has been rebuilt. The church also has 13th and 15th century additions. The east windows and tower were built in the nineteenth century. The stonework at the abbey shows carved human and animals and a combination of Cistercian and Irish Romanesque architecture.

One daughter, Kathleen Paige Murray, worked for the Niagara Movement. In 1898 his daughter, Mary Vivian, and his wife died of tuberculosis. On September 1, 1898, Murray married his live-in nanny and mistress, Delilah \\\\- who was a cousin of Laura. They had one daughter, Florence Rogers. Murray had at least two other daughters, Kathleen (Luckett) and Florence, and two sons, F. Morris and William M. Freeman H. M.

In 1884, Murray passed the civil service exam in Ohio and moved to the Washington, DC area where he was appointed to a position in the Pension Division of the War Department, making him the first black person from Ohio to be appointed to a federal position. Murray moved to Alexandria, Virginia, where he started a real estate business. He purchased a large manor house which he considered a \\"post Civil War Underground Railroad System\\", as a safe house for African Americans at risk of persecution and lynching. With his brother, John, he created the Murray Brothers Printers and Publishing Company. Murray was very active in African-American politics and activism. He worked with Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, Lafayette M Hershaw, James M Waldron, William Monroe Trotter, and W. E. B. Du Bois. Murray was particularly active working with Wells to fight lynching. After Douglass died, Murray became caretaker of the Frederick Douglass Memorial Cemetery. Murray frequently wrote and spoke in opposition to Booker T. Washington, questioning Washington's strategies for failing to recognize the radical nature of the change needed. In April 1890, W. B. Dulaney, Rev. R. H. Porter, William Gray, and Murray formed the New Era Building Association to aid blacks to purchase homes and invest savings.More Charters, Alexandria Gazette (Alexandria, Virginia), April 7, 1890, page 3 accessed August 12, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6209646/more_charters_alexandria_gazette/ In December 1891, Murray, Rev.

In 1907 Murray and others were rallying opposition to Booker T. Washington's Tuskegee Institute and Theodore Roosevelt in the black press. Washington sent his assistant, New York Customs Agent Charles W. Anderson to suggest action against the radicals to Roosevelt. Anderson opposed the idea of Niagara movement members holding federal jobs and succeeded at convincing President Roosevelt that Murray should be demoted.Jacqueline M. Moore, Leading the Race: The Transformation of the Black Elite in the Nation's Capital, 1880-1920 University of Virginia Press, 1999, p. 154 =The Horizon= In order to publicize the views of the Niagara Movement, Du Bois, Hershaw, and F. H. M. Murray began publication of the magazine, \\"The Horizon\\". The journal was published from 1907 to 1910; Murray was printer and Du Bois and Hershaw were co-editors W. M.

He wrote an influential book, Emancipation and the Freed American in Sculpture in 1916 where he discussed the role of African Americans in sculpture. Murray advocated advances in African American culture and art. Murray's book was concerned with the tendency of sculptures celebrating emancipation focusing on its heroes and great battles, and that they would tend to overlook slavery, thereby lessening its role in the national consciousness. This concern with the politics of representation and memory of slavery and black history has influenced many 20th and 21st century scholars.Ater, Ren√©e, Slavery and Its Memory in Public Monuments.

Nomenclature and history Kepler Space Telescope search volume, in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy. Prior to Kepler observation, Kepler-432 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19330772+4817092. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 10864656, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-1299. Planetary candidates were detected around the star by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth, although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used. Following the acceptance of the discovery paper, the Kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of \\"Kepler-432\\". The discoverers referred to the star as Kepler-432, which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft. Hence, this is the name used by the public to refer to the star and its planet. Candidate planets that are associated with stars studied by the Kepler Mission are assigned the designations \\".01\\", \\".02\\" etc. after the star's name, in the order of discovery. If planet candidates are detected simultaneously, then the ordering follows the order of orbital periods from shortest to longest. Following these rules, there was two candidate planets detected, with orbital periods of 52.501129 and 406.2 days. The designation b and c derive from the order of discovery. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, and c to the farthest. In the case of Kepler-432, there was initially two detected, so the letters b and c are used. The planets are more commonly referred to without the \\"A\\" designation, although sometimes the full designation is used. Stellar characteristics Kepler-432 is a binary star system composed of a K-type giant star (Kepler-432 A) and a red dwarf star (Kepler-432 B). The apparent magnitude of the system, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is about 15.8. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Kepler-432 A= Kepler-432 A is a K-type giant star. It has exhausted the hydrogen in its core and has begun expanding into a red giant. The star has a mass and radius 132% and 406% that of the Sun. It has a temperature of 4995 K and is 4.2 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a temperature of 5778 K. The primary star is metal-rich, with a metallicity ([Fe/H]) of about 0.17, or about 147% of the amount of iron and other heavier metals found in the Sun. Its luminosity is typical for an evolving giant star like Kepler-432, with a luminosity about 9.3 times the solar luminosity. The apparent magnitude of the system, or how bright it appears from Earth's perspective, is about 15.8. Therefore, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. =Kepler-432 B= Kepler-432 B is a red dwarf companion with an estimated mass 36% that of the Sun and an estimated temperature of 3660 K. The projected separation is estimated to be around 750 AU. Planetary system The primary companion is known to host 2 giant planets, both more massive then Jupiter. The innermost planet, Kepler-432b, is interacting with its star and is slowly spiraling inwards towards its star as a result of tidal interaction. It will probably be devoured by its star as it expands past the orbit of planet b. The outermost planet was only detected through radial velocity and hence only its mass is known.

It has a small engine and limited gliding performance but is inexpensive to buy and run and simple to build and fly. Kit production began in 2013 and by the following year twenty had been sold. Design Designed by Francesco Di Martino, the Zigolo is based on the unpowered Sandlin Goat primary glider. The design priority was to produce a motor-glider which would be inexpensive to build, transport and store. It is marketed as a powered glider but qualifies in the UK as an SSDR (single-seat, deregulated) microlight. Kit build time is quoted as less than 100 hrs. It can be dismantled for transport and reassembled for flight within an hour. Its structure throughout is based on aluminium tubes, its flying surfaces covered with bonded fabric. It has a high, braced, wing of rectangular plan with blunted tips, rigged with 3¬∞ of dihedral. The ailerons occupy the whole of the trailing edges apart from a central gap. The fuselage is an uncovered tube structure, with the exposed pilot's seat on a pair of tubes which form the basis of the forward section with a curved reinforcing girder under it. The primary wing bracing, V-struts from the wing spars, are attached to them. They meet at the nose, where another tube joins them to the forward spar. Behind the wing the lower fuselage member is a single tube, braced at its forward end by a pair of tubes upwards to the rear spar and at its rear by another long pair to the rear spar. A horizontal pair of tubes from the rear spar to a vertical rudder post, which joins the lower fuselage tube at its base, complete the rear frame. The upper frame supports a straight-edged tailplane with balanced elevators and a balanced rudder which extends from the keel to above the tailplane via an elevator cut-out. The Zigolo's single-cylinder two- stroke engine is mounted on the fuselage frame in pusher configuration below the wing trailing edge. Its propeller is driven through belt gearing, the top of the propeller disc in the gap between the ailerons. An optional electric engine is also available.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 98. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. It has fixed landing gear with small mainwheels mounted apart on split axles hinged from a central pylon below the main fuselage frame. Gas shock absorbers lean in from the axles' extremities to the lower frame. There is a small tailwheel. The Zingalo is fitted with a ballistic parachute mounted on the sloping fuselage member ahead of the pilot. Development The Zigolo first flew in 2012 and later that year the prototype was joined by a demonstrator. The first production aircraft appeared at the April 2013 Friedrichshafen show; by then the type had flown more than 300 hrs. Twenty kits had been sold by March 2014 to builders across Europe, China, Japan and the US. There are two on the UK register in 2016.

Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, called the disaster a \\"historic, unprecedented flooding event\\" and declared a state of emergency. Many rivers and waterways, particularly the Amite and Comite rivers, reached record levels, and rainfall exceeded in multiple parishes. Because numerous homeowners who were affected were without flood insurance, the federal government is providing disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The flood has been called the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. 60 deaths have been reported as a result of the flooding.  Meteorological history  upright=1.3 Early on August 11, a mesoscale convective system flared up in southern Louisiana around a weak area of low pressure that was situated next to an outflow boundary. It remained nearly stationary, and as a result, torrential downpours occurred in the areas surrounding Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Rainfall rates of up to an hour were reported in the most deluged areas where totals exceeded nearly in some areas as a result of the system remaining stationary. Accumulations peaked at in Watson, just northeast of Baton Rouge. The Washington Post noted that the \\"no-name storm\\" dumped three times as much rain on Louisiana as Hurricane Katrina. It dropped the equivalent of 7.1 trillion gallons of water or enough to fill Lake Pontchartrain about four times. Hurricane Katrina, by comparison, dumped about 2.3 trillion gallons of rainwater in the state (though more in other states). The flooding rains also dumped more water than had Hurricane Isaac. According to the National Weather Service Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, the amount of rainfall in the hardest-hit locations had a less than 0.1 percent chance of happening or was a (less than) 1-in-1,000-year event. Because the rain was not associated with a named storm, there was less warning to the public for emergency preparations. GPM provides a closer look at the Louisiana floods. = Climate change connection = A rapid attribution study, published within one month after the event,van der Wiel, K., S. B. Kapnick, G. J. van Oldenborgh, K. Whan, S. Philip, G. A. Vecchi, R. K. Singh, J. Arrighi, and H. Cullen (2016), \\"Rapid attribution of the August 2016 flood-inducing extreme precipitation in south Louisiana to climate change\\", Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., 2016, 1‚Äì40 indicates an anthropogenic climate warming role in the increased probability of the return time of a similar extreme event happening in the future. A follow-on peer-reviewed paper indicates that the catastrophic flood in Louisiana was a result of intense precipitation produced by a slow-moving, tropical, low-pressure system interacting with an eastward- traveling baroclinic trough to the north. While tropical-midlatitude interactions of this nature are rare, they are not unprecedented. Analyses point towards the tendency for more and perhaps stronger upper-level troughs propagating out of the western U.S. in summer; these have an increasing potential to cross paths with low-pressure systems that form around the Gulf Coast. Combined with the projected increase in precipitable water, resulting precipitation magnitude would increase. Large-ensemble modeling indicates that the prospect of future tropical-midlatitude interactions is a scenario that Louisiana will face in the future. Regional simulations suggest that the climate warming since 1985 may have increased the event precipitation (August 11‚Äì14, 2016) on the order of 20%. Rainfall like this and the emergency help needed after the flooding subsides are straining the federal system for aid to states. Some analysts wonder if this is the new normal for storms and floods.  Flooding  upright=1.2 Flooding began in earnest on August 12. On August 13, a flash flood emergency was issued for areas along the Amite and Comite rivers. By August 15, more than ten rivers (Amite, Vermilion, Calcasieu, Comite, Mermentau, Pearl, Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, and Bogue Chitto) and many more had reached a moderate, major, or record flood stage. Eight rivers reached record levels, including the Amite and Comite rivers. The Amite River crested at nearly above the previous record in Denham Springs. Nearly one-third of all homes‚Äîapproximately 15,000 structures‚Äîin Ascension Parish were flooded after a levee along the Amite River was overtopped. Water levels began to slowly recede by August 15, though large swaths of land remained submerged. Livingston Parish was one the hardest hit areas; an official estimated that 75 percent of the homes in the parish were a \\"total loss\\". It was thought over 146,000 homes were damaged in Louisiana. This mass flooding also damaged thousands of businesses. The upright=1.2 Thirteen people have been confirmed dead as a consequence of the flooding. An elderly woman in Livingston Parish was confirmed dead by parish officials. A man's body was found Wednesday on Whitehall Avenue in Denham Springs. Officials said they found a man in his 50s in the South Point subdivision off of Walker South. They added he had no obvious signs of trauma, and the area he was found in had five-feet of water in it at one point. Of the other deaths, five people have died in East Baton Rouge Parish, three in Tangipahoa Parish, two in St. Helena Parish, two in Livingston Parish and one in Rapides Parish from the storms and their aftermath. = Evacuations and rescues = The US Coast Guard coordinating rescue operations with the St. Amant Fire Department in the Baton Rouge area. The widespread flooding stranded tens of thousands of people in their homes and vehicles. At least 30,000 people were rescued by local law enforcement, firefighters, the Louisiana National Guard, the Coast Guard and fellow residents, from submerged vehicles and flooded homes. Many boat-owning residents of Louisiana and Mississippi, together with other volunteers, formed an informal rescue service known as the Cajun Navy and navigated through flooded areas to answer calls for help that they received via social media. They rescued as many as a thousand people and pets and distributed emergency supplies. A group of 70 volunteers from St. Bernard Parish conducted hundreds of boat rescues in East Baton Rouge Parish. By August 15, approximately 11,000 people sought refuge in 70 shelters. Flash flooding swamped a section of Interstate 12 between Tangipahoa Parish and Baton Rouge, stranding 125 vehicles. At one point, an approximately 62-mile stretch was closed because of flooding concerns. State police and the National Guard used high-water vehicles to rescue trapped motorists, but many remained stuck for over 24 hours. A cellular network outage complicated rescues over the affected area. On August 12, a state of emergency was activated for the whole of Louisiana.  Aftermath  The upright=1.2 With an estimated 146,000 homes damaged in the flooding thousands of Louisianans were forced into shelters, with more than 11,000 in state-operated shelters. This prompted an estimated 1,500 American Red Cross volunteers to travel to Louisiana. Other groups such as Louisiana State University, the Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New Orleans, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Celebration Church, Grace Church of Central, and the Church of Scientology also sent aid. There were media reports of one man who cooked of brisket for displaced people. The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals attempted to rescue stray pets, and the Second Harvest Food Bank and the United Way of Southeast Louisiana sent supplies and food. More than 109,398 individuals and households registered for FEMA assistance, and FEMA approved $132 million for assistance. Singer Beyonc√©, along with sister Solange and Kelly Rowland, held an event that raised more $4 million for those affected by the floods in Baton Rouge. In addition, singer Taylor Swift donated $1 million to Louisiana's relief fund. Lady Gaga donated an unspecified amount of money. On August 13, the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters was activated by the USGS, allowing for the humanitarian redeployment of satellite assets by the international community. AT&T; donated $100,000 to be split between the Baton Rouge Area Foundation and DonorsChoose.org for flood relief. Randy Jackson and Harry Connick Jr. were scheduled to host a benefit concert at the Baton Rouge River Center Theatre on September 5, featuring over a dozen artists, and all proceeds went to the American Red Cross Louisiana Flood Relief fund. On the \\"Ellen\\" show Friday, September 9, host Ellen DeGeneres announced that she and Britney Spears would each donate $125,000 to help victims of the Louisiana Flood of 2016. Both celebrities are from Louisiana. Spears gave $125,000 to the Louisiana Red Cross to buy a new emergency response vehicle. DeGeneres received a letter from Betsey Baldwin, a P.E. teacher at Galvez Middle School in Ascension parish, which was inundated with two feet of water. The school has 620 students, who after the floods have been forced to study at another, nearby school. \\"I thought of one person that would help me, and it was you,\\" Baldwin said. The company Shutterfly, at the request of DeGeneres, donated $125,000 to help Galvez Middle School recover. = Impact on school system = During the peak of the floods, around 265,000 children have been out of school, nearly 30% of the school-aged population in the state of Louisiana. There were reports that 6 schools were heavily flooded in East Baton Rouge Parish with another 15 in Livingston Parish. Livingston Parish's Superintendent, Rick Wentzel, believes that their school system is in a similar position to the Northshore following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and he held a meeting with the school district to discuss possible options. Livingston Parish conducted a teacher survey August 23‚Äì24, and a parent survey August 25 to assess how those are affected, and on Friday, August 26, 2016, Superintendent Rick Wentzel announced that Livingston Parish Public Schools will be resuming class on September 12, 2016. Wentzel, who was affected by the flooding himself, said he was \\"very pleased\\" that all schools will be resuming together. The late restart date is because LPPS received the most extensive damage with eight of the 15 flooded schools having \\"extensive damage.\\" Wentzel said that each school will have a welcome back event for parents and students before returning on September 12, 27 school days following the August 4 start date. Wentzel said that the restart will have some unfortunate \\"side effects\\" as some schools will be temporarily platooned. The platooned schools were Denham Springs High School at Live Oak High School, Denham Springs Freshman High at Live Oak Middle School, Southside Junior High at Juban Parc High School, and Springfield High School at Springfield Middle School. All host schools were in session from 6:30 am until 11:40 am and all platooned schools were in session from 12:25 pm until 5:37 pm. The two elementary schools were in class alongside their relocated school. Denham Springs Elementary was split among Eastside Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1, 2) and Freshwater Elementary (Grades: 3, 4, 5) while Southside Elementary was split among Lewis Vincent Elementary (Grades: PreK, K, 1) and Juban Parc Elementary (Grades: 2, 3, 4, 5). This announcement also came with Superintendent Wentzel saying ALL students will receive free lunch until September 30. Following a school board meeting on Thursday, September 9, Assistant Superintendent Stephen Parill announced the \\"known and confident updates\\" for the 2016 Academic Calendar. Only four changes were made to the calendar that include: changing Thursday, September 15 from a half-day to a whole day, removing the parish fair holiday on Friday, October 7 (the fair was cancelled due to the flooding), removing a parent-teacher conference day on Thursday, October 20, and making Wednesday, November 16 a whole day instead of a half-day. The board also voted to add class time to the day. Parill said they are still waiting on their appeal to Louisiana BESE waiving the required minutes of class, and any further changes will be made after BESE's ruling. For the entire state, superintendent John White said that at least 22 schools had heavy damage and will need time to recover. There were also many school closures due to flooding in the Lafayette area as well. Many teachers' homes flooded, with 4,000 staff members' homes in Baker sustaining damage and another 2,000 in East Baton Rouge Parish. East Baton Rouge Parish schools announced they won't open back up until September 6, 25 days after school was originally canceled for the floods on August 12, the third day of school. Transportation was a challenge for many districts across the state, as many kids were displaced from their homes and many school buses were damaged from flood water. = Prison system = The Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women (LCIW), located in St. Gabriel and the sole Louisiana state prison for women, had 985 prisoners at the time of the flooding. The prison experienced flooding ranging from to . LCIW, the only state-operated prison to receive flooding during the incident, temporarily closed. It was the first time in state history that the whole population of a particular prison was evacuated to other facilities. the prisoners were still housed in other prisons.\\"Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women.\\" Louisiana Department of Corrections. Retrieved on June 29, 2017. Archive, Archive #2 Elayn Hunt Correctional Center, next to LCIW, was not evacuated. = Economic impact = An upright=1.3 Damages were anticipated to reach $10‚Äì15 billion, with this storm likely ranking as the seventh most expensive of natural disasters in the US since 1978. Because many of the areas that flooded were not in \\"high flood risk areas,\\" the majority of homeowners affected by the flood did not have flood insurance. Across Louisiana, about 21% of all structures have coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program. Despite this, in many parishes that percentage is much lower. In St. Helena Parish, which was among the hardest hit parishes by the floods, less than 1% of all homeowners had flood insurance. Because of the large number of homeowners without flood insurance that were affected, the federal government is providing disaster aid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The flood has been called the worst US natural disaster since Hurricane Sandy in 2012. FEMA, which has stepped in to help homeowners without flood insurance, has declared these 20 parishes as federal disaster areas: Acadia, Ascension, Avoyelles, East Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, Evangeline, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Livingston, Pointe Coupee, St. Helena, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Vermilion, Washington, and West Feliciana. Homeowners with damage from the floods in those parishes are eligible for up to $33,000 in federal disaster aid and so far around 102,000 people have applied for help. For business continuity and community rebuilding, private mobile flood recovery centers have also been made available, including a 10-piece modular building complex used in Baton Rouge by FEMA as a portable school for children of displaced families who moved north from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.

The work was commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra under the direction of Osmo V√§nsk√§. It was first performed by the cellist Arek Tesarczyk and the Minnesota Orchestra conducted by Osmo V√§nsk√§ in Orchestra Hall, Minneapolis, on September 30, 2010. The piece is dedicated to the cellist Truls M√∏rk, who was originally scheduled to perform the world premiere, but had to drop due to health concerns. Composition Towards the Horizon has a duration of roughly 20 minutes and is composed in one continuous movement. It was written between 2008 and 2009 and was the composer's last concerto before his death in July 2016. Rautavaara anticipated this event in the score program notes, reflecting, \\"Of my twelve concertos the first was for cello, and now again a cello concerto may end the series.\\" =Instrumentation= The work is scored for a solo cello and an orchestra comprising two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, timpani, percussion, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Larry Fuchsberg of the Star Tribune opined, \\"Towards the Horizon' won't enjoy the popularity of Rautavaara's Seventh Symphony or his Cantus Arcticus. The music never hurries. Rhythmic interest is slight, harmonic interest substantial: The concerto has a dissonant lushness, at times suggesting a Hollywood film score that's taken an odd turn.\\" Reviewing a recording of the work by Truls M√∏rk and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, Tom Huizenga of NPR wrote, \\"Written for Norwegian cellist Truls M√∏rk [...], the concerto unfolds as a long, romantic song, with barely a breath in the cello line. The nearly constant outpouring of lyricism includes achingly beautiful passages sung in the cello's very highest register in the finale.\\" Hilary Finch of BBC Music Magazine similarly observed, \\"Truls M√∏rk's free and graceful flights of endlessly varying and regenerating melody come after a powerful pentatonic opening theme, almost Sibelian in strength. The cello's voice, both dreamlike and impassioned, is accompanied in its flight by avian woodwind, buffeted here and there by storm clouds of timpani.\\" Guy Rickards of Gramophone further remarked: Recording A recording of the work, performed by Truls M√∏rk and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by John Storg√•rds, was released through Ondine on February 28, 2012.

They fought on the Western Front during World War I. In World War II, the unit took part in the Battle of France and Dunkirk evacuation, the Anglo-Iraqi War with 'Kingcol', the Western Desert Campaign in which it distinguished itself at the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, and finally fought as infantry in the Chindits. The unit was disbanded in 1947. Artillery Volunteers 1859-1908 The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. Three Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were formed in Lincolnshire in 1860 and they were brought together under the 1st Administrative Brigade, Lincolnshire Artillery Volunteers in July 1861, with headquarters at Grimsby:Beckett, Appendix VIII.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 114‚Äì5.Army List, various dates. * 1st Corps formed at Boston on 12 January 1860 * 2nd Corps formed at Grimsby on 27 January 1860 * 3rd Corps formed at Louth on 12 November 1860 George Morland Hutton, a former Lieutenant in the 46th Foot, was appointed Major in command in 1862 and promoted to Lieutenant- Colonel in 1866. He retained the command until 1897, when he was appointed Honorary Colonel and was succeeded as Commanding Officer (CO) by Lt-Col A. Bannister. Victoria Street North, Grimsby, 2006 In May 1880 the Corps were consolidated as the 1st Lincolnshire Artillery Volunteers, with six and a half batteries distributed as follows: * Nos 1 and 2 at Boston * Nos 3, 4 and 5 at Grimsby * No 6 and a further half battery at Louth In 1886, the unit's title was changed to 3rd Volunteer (Lincolnshire) Brigade, Eastern Division, RA. This was retained until 1889 when it became the 1st Lincolnshire AVC (Western Division, RA). By 1890, the unit comprised four Position Artillery batteries (semi-mobile units organised to work alongside the Volunteer Infantry brigades). In 1891, a drill hall was built in Victoria Street North, Grimsby.Osborne, p. 160. In 1899, the Artillery Volunteers were transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), the unit becoming the 1st Lincolnshire RGA (Volunteers) with the role of heavy artillery. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. it was organised into regional infantry divisions, each with an establishment of four Royal Field Artillery (RFA) brigades. The 1st Lincolnshire RGA (V) became I North Midland Brigade, RFA (TF), in the North Midland Division, with the following organisation:London Gazette 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 61‚Äì7.Conrad, British Army, 1914.Litchfield, pp. 142‚Äì3.46 Division at Long, Long Trail.RFA Btys (TF) at Regimental Warpath. * HQ at Artillery Drill Hall, Victoria Street, GrimsbyLincolnshire at Great War Centenary Drill Halls.Grimsby at Drill Hall Project. * 1st Lincolnshire Battery at Artillery Drill Hall, Main Ridge, BostonBoston at Drill Hall Project. * 2nd Lincolnshire Battery at Grimsby * 3rd Lincolnshire Battery at 4 Eve Street, LouthLouth at Drill Hall Project. * I North Midland Ammunition Column at Grimsby Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Grange, who had been in command since 1902, continued as CO of the new unit. He was succeeded on 2 July 1910 by Lt-Col J. Tonge, VD, who was still CO on the outbreak of World War I. World War I =Mobilisation= 15-pounder gun. The order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914. Shortly afterwards, the men were invited to volunteer for overseas service, and the majority having accepted this liability, the North Midland Division concentrated at Luton. In November, it moved to the area round Bishop's Stortford where it completed its war training. At the time of mobilisation, the batteries of I North Midland Bde were each equipped with four 15-pounder guns.Farndale, Western Front, p. 86. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The flood of recruits coming forward were enrolled in these 2nd Line units.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. The 2/I North Midland Brigade was assigned to the 2nd North Midland DivisionBecke, Pt 2b, pp. 17‚Äì23. =1/I North Midland Brigade= The North Midland Division began embarking for France on 25 February 1915, and by 8 March had completed its concentration at Ploegsteert in Belgium ‚Äì the first complete TF division to deploy to the Western Front with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It was numbered the 46th (North Midland) Division shortly afterwards.MacDonald, p. 32. Hooge Over the following months, the artillery supported the infantry in routine trench warfare in the Ypres Salient. On 19 July, the Royal Engineers exploded a mine under the German Army's positions at Hooge, but the infantry of 3rd Division tasked with seizing the crater had not been given a supporting artillery fireplan. As the infantry were being driven out by German artillery, counter-battery fire from 46th Division's guns and other neighbouring artillery helped to rectify the situation. When the Germans attacked the Hooge crater with flamethrowers on 30 July, 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade of 46th Division was able to stabilise the line with the help of the divisional artillery.Farndale, Western Front, p. 113.MacDonald, pp. 33‚Äì5. Hohenzollern Redoubt 46th Division's first offensive operation was the Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. This was an attempt to restart the failed Battle of Loos, and the division was moved down from Ypres on 1 October for the purpose. The Germans recaptured the Hohenzollern trench system on 3 October, and the new attack was aimed at this point. The artillery bombardment (by the field guns of 46th and 28th Division, backed by heavy batteries) began at 12.00 on 13 October and the infantry went in at 14.00 behind a gas cloud. The attack was a disaster, most of the leading waves being cut down by machine gun and shell fire from German positions that had not been suppressed by the bombardment.Cherry, pp. 269‚Äì97.MacDonald, pp. 39‚Äì46.Rawson, pp. 120‚Äì8. 18-pounder preserved at the Imperial War Museum. 1/I NM Brigade was re-equipped with 18-pounder guns in November. On 23 December the 46th (NM) Division was ordered to embark for Egypt. It entrained for Marseilles, and some of the infantry had actually reached Egypt before the order was rescinded on 21 January 1916. The artillery returned from Marseilles and the whole division reassembled on the Western Front near Amiens by 14 February. Gommecourt On 1 May 1916, the division was ordered into the line facing Gommecourt in preparation for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. Over the first 10 days of the month, the divisional artillery took over the existing battery positions along this front and began digging additional gun pits, observation posts (OPs) and dugouts to new designs.MacDonald, pp. 69, 80, 86. During this period, the field brigades of the BEF were reorganised. On 19 April 1916 an extra battery of four 18-pounders was formed, and on 13 May the brigade was assigned a number as CCXXX (230) Brigade, RFA, the batteries being redesignated A, B, C and D. Then on 23 May the new D Bty was exchanged for the former 1st Derbyshire Howitzer Bty of CCXXXIII (4th NM) Bde, equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers, which became D (H) Bty. Lastly, the Brigade Ammunition Columns were merged into the Divisional Ammunition Column.MacDonald, pp. 86, 108. Lieutenant-Colonel Tonge was awarded a CMG in the June 1916 Birthday Honours List.MacDonald, p. 137. Preparations were under way for the 46th and 56th (1st London) Divisions to carry out an Attack on the Gommecourt Salient as a diversion from the main offensive further south. 46th Division would attack from the north west, converging with 56th from the south west.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 456‚Äì62. On 18 June, 46th Divisional artillery was allocated its tasks for wire-cutting and registration of targets ahead of the attack. It was divided into two groups: CCXXX Bde was grouped with CCXXXIII Bde on the right under Lt-Col Tonge, supporting 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade, which was to make the division's right attack towards Gommecourt Wood. Right Group had its batteries dug in west and south west of Gommecourt with a concentration of three batteries around Chateau de la Haye and three others scattered around Sailly-au-Bois and Foncquevillers intermixed with 56th Division's batteries. Right Group's responsibility was the German line from the westernmost tip of Gommecourt Park to a point just north of the Gommecourt‚ÄìFoncquevillers road.MacDonald, pp.165‚Äì7. 46th Division used a high proportion of its 18-pounder ammunition to bombard enemy trenches and lines of communication, and a smaller proportion (about 27 per cent) of shrapnel shells to cut German Wire entanglements. One lane was to be cut by A/CCXXX Bty through the wire halfway up the side of Gommecourt Park as a diversion from the actual front to be attacked. A/CCXXX Battery had a daily allocation of 350 shells, while the other batteries each had 480.MacDonald, pp. 208‚Äì9, 277. Apart from the wire- cutting batteries, the divisional artillery was under the direction of VII Corps during the preliminary bombardment, which began on 24 June, but at zero hour it reverted to divisional control. Once the infantry went 'over the top' the field guns were to make a series of short 'lifts', almost amounting to a 'creeping barrage'.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 460‚Äì1.Farndale, Western Front, p. 147.MacDonald, pp 296. 302‚Äì3. A final 'whirlwind' bombardment by all the guns began at 06.25 on 1 July and at zero hour (07.30) 137th Brigade made its attack with 1/6th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment and 1/6th Bn North Staffordshire Regiment in the lead. Patrols had already established that the German wire was not adequately cut: there were four partially cut lanes on the South Staffs' front and five areas of weakened wire in front of the North Staffs. In addition, German casualties during the bombardment had been few because of their deep dugouts, and when the attack went in their men emerged to receive the attack with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from their trenches and from Gommecourt Wood. Held up by uncut wire in dead ground and by enemy fire, the brigade's leading two waves only reached the German first line and were forced to take cover in shell holes where they exchanged Grenade attacks with the Germans. The third wave was stopped by machine gun fire short of the first line. The British infantry were unable to keep up with the covering barrage of the 18-pounders, which was lifted onto each enemy trench line to a strict timetable: artillery observation during the attack was difficult due to the smoke and confusion. Meanwhile, the supporting waves were held up in the jumping-off trenches or in No man's land by enemy shellfire. The whole attack had halted in bloody failure by 08.00.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 465‚Äì7.MacDonald, pp. 293‚Äì343. The Forward Observation Officer of CCXXX Bde reported the holdup at 08.16. The commander of 137th Bde attempted to bring the barrage back so that a second attack could be launched by the supporting battalions (1/5th South Staffs and 1/5th North Staffs). At about 08.45, VII Corps ordered a renewed bombardment on Gommecourt Wood, but the support units were already inextricably held up by mud and shellfire in their own trenches and the attack was postponed several times. It was not until 15.30 that 137th Bde was ready to attack again. However, the neighbouring brigade never began the advance, and 137th Bde's officers called off the attack at the last minute.Edmonds, 1916, pp. 468‚Äì70.MacDonald, pp. 344‚Äì57, 418‚Äì23, 433‚Äì50. Reorganisation The Gommecourt attack had been a diversion, and it was not renewed after the first day's disaster. 46th Division remained in position while the Somme offensive continued further south throughout the summer and autumn.MacDonald, pp. 555‚Äì6. There was further reorganisation amongst divisional artillery on 28 August, in which CCXXXIII Bde was broken up, with its A Bty (formerly D Bty of the CCXXX Bde) rejoining, with Right Section assigned to A/CCXXX, Left Section to B/CCXXX, and Left Section of C/CCXXXIII joining C/CCXXX to bring them up to six 18-pounders each. A final round of reorganisation came in the new year, when CCXXXII (3rd NM) Bde left the division, leaving a section of its C Bty (formerly 512 (Howitzer) Bty) to bring D (H)/CCXXX up to six 4.5-inch howitzers. For the remainder of the war the brigade had the following organisation. 4.5-inch howitzer preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. * A/CCXXX (1/1st Lincolnshire Bty + Right Section former D Bty) 6 x 18-pdrs * B/CCXXX (1/2nd Lincolnshire Bty + Left Section former D Bty) 6 x 18-pdrs * C/CCXXX (1/3rd Lincolnshire Bty + Section C/CCXXXIII Bty) 6 x 18-pdrs * D (H)/CCXXX (1/1st Derbyshire Bty + Section 512 (H) Bty) 6 x 4.5-inch howitzers Bucquoy At the beginning of March 1917, patrols found that the Germans were beginning to retreat from the Gommecourt defences. 46th (NM) Division followed up slowly and cautiously, but on the night of 14 March an attack on Bucquoy Graben (trench) by 137th Brigade led to heavy casualties. The rushed attack had been ordered by V Corps headquarters despite the protests of the divisional commander, and there was not time for the artillery adequately to cut the enemy wire. The attack went in behind an artillery barrage moving at 100 yards in four minutes but although 'the assault was gallantly pressed' (Official History) it was a complete failure.MacDonald, pp. 556‚Äì7.Campbell-Johnson, p. 9.Falls, pp. 108‚Äì9.Accounts of attack on Bucquoy at Buxton War Memorials The Germans eventually retreated as far as their new Hindenburg Line defences well beyond the Somme battlefields (Operation Alberich), but 46th Division was withdrawn from the pursuit on 17 March.MacDonald, pp. 559‚Äì6. Lens After rest and training, 46th Division returned to the line in the coal-mining sector around Lens in April. In May and June, the division carried out small-scale operations against Hill 65.Campbell-Johnson, pp. 10‚Äì19. 46th Division was now ordered to capture Lens itself, beginning on 28 June. Another divisional attack on 1 July aimed at capturing more houses and trenches. 137 Brigade attacked 'Aconite' trench behind a creeping barrage beginning at 02.47. By 07.00 the two right companies held Aconite, but the two left companies were held up in severe house-to-house fighting. A second push at 08.00 cleared the cellars round the church and caused heavy casualties to the defenders. But in the afternoon a German counter-attacks drove the battalion back to its start line.Campbell-Johnson, pp. 19, 24‚Äì30. After Lens, the division was withdrawn into reserve, and did not engage in major operations again during 1917. St Quentin Canal The 46th Division had been very unlucky during the war, the infantry in particular taking appalling casualties at the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Gommecourt, but it gained revenge at the Battle of the St Quentin Canal on 29 September 1918 when it performed one of the great feats of World War I by crossing the canal and breaking open the Hindenburg Line. Careful artillery preparation and support was an integral part of this success. 46th Division had nine brigades of field artillery under its command, including CCXXX Bde, and several brigades of corps heavy artillery were also firing on the division's front. The bombardment began on the night of 26/27 September with harassing fire and gas shells, followed with intense bombardment with high explosive shells until the morning of the assault.Priestley, pp. 39‚Äì41.Farndale, pp. 298‚Äì9.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, p. 103. Every field gun was used in carefully timed barrages: creeping barrages (including smoke shells) ahead of the attacking troops, with pauses at the end of each phase, including a standing barrage of three hours to allow mopping-up of the first objectives to be carried out, and the second wave of troops to pass through and renew the attack behind the creeping barrage.Priestley, pp. 41, 46‚Äì50. The first of these creeping barrages actually progressed at twice the normal pace while the infantry rushed downhill to seize the canal crossings; it was described in the Official History as 'one of the finest ever seen'. The attack was a brilliant success, and by the afternoon the field artillery batteries were crossing the canal by the bridges that had been captured or thrown across, and were coming into action on the far side.Priestley, p. 73. Over succeeding weeks, the division took part in a succession of successive follow- up attacks: Battle of the Beaurevoir Line, Battle of Cambrai (1918), Battle of the Selle and Battle of the Sambre (1918). On 8 November 1918, in its last operation of the war, 46th Division pushed forward 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade to seize the Avesnes road, aided by concentrations of fire from the field artillery, which had managed to keep up with the rapid advance.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 519‚Äì20. CCXXX Brigade was placed in suspended animation in 1919. =2/I North Midland Brigade= De Bange 90 mm cannon issued to 2nd Line TF units. Meanwhile, the men who had not volunteered for foreign service, together with the recruits who were coming forward, remained to form the 2/I North Midland Brigade, RFA, in the 2nd North Midland Division (59th (2nd North Midland) Division from August 1915), which concentrated round Luton in January 1915.59th (2nd NM) Division at Long, Long Trail. At first the 2nd Line recruits had to parade in civilian clothes and train with 'Quaker' guns ‚Äì logs of wood mounted on cart wheels ‚Äì but these shortages were slowly made up. Uniforms arrived in November 1914, but it was not until March 1915 that a few 90 mm French guns arrived for training. The division took over the requisitioned transport and second-hand horse harness when 46th Division was re-equipped and left for France. The divisional artillery were joined at Luton by the1st Line 4th Home Counties (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA, and Wessex Heavy Bty, RGA, which were fully equipped and could lend guns for training. Later, the 59th Divisional Artillery took over some 15-pounders from a TF division that was proceeding to India. In July, the division moved out of overcrowded Luton, the artillery moving to Hemel Hempstead, where they spent the winter of 1915‚Äì16. In early 1916, the batteries were finally brought up to establishment in horses, and 18-pounders replaced the 15-pounders.Bradbridge, pp. 8, 86‚Äì9, 115‚Äì7. Ireland In April 1916, the 59th Division was the mobile division of Central Force in England, and it was ordered to Ireland when the Easter Rising occurred, the divisional artillery landing at Kingstown on 28 April. The artillery moved up to Ballsbridge to support the infantry but was not engaged, and once the trouble in Dublin had been suppressed, the troops moved out to The Curragh to continue training.Bradbridge, pp. 9‚Äì12, 89‚Äì90, 117‚Äì8. As was the case with the RFA units in the BEF, the brigade went through major reorganisation at this time. On 29 April 1916, the batteries were designated A, B and C, and later the brigade was numbered CCXCV (295) Brigade, RFA. At the end of May the brigade was joined by 2/1st Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery (equipped with four 18-pounder field guns rather than horse artillery guns) which became D/CCXCV. However, on 10 July, the Hampshire RHA Bty was exchanged for A (Howitzer) Bty from CCXCVIII (2/IV NM) Bde (originally 2/1st Derbyshire Bty). This became D (H) Bty, equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers. On 31 July, the Brigade Ammunition Column was absorbed into 59th Divisional Ammunition Column.Farndale, Western Front, Annex D.Bradbridge, pp. 89‚Äì90, 118. Western Front In January 1917, the 59th Division was relieved in Ireland and returned to the UK, concentrating at the Fovant training area on the edge of Salisbury Plain preparatory to embarking for France. Before leaving for France, CCXCVII (2/III NM) Bde was broken up, with sections Btys joining A, B and C Btys of CCXCV Bde to bring them up to six 18-pounders each. Once in France, D (H) Bty was made up to six 4.5-inch howitzers by the addition of a section from C (H) Bty from CCLXXXVII (2/III West Lancashire) Bde in 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division. For the remainder of the war the brigade had the following organisation. * A/CCXCV (2/1st Lincolnshire Bty + Section 2/4th Staffordshire Bty) 6 x 18-pdrs * B/CCXCV (2/2nd Lincolnshire Bty + Section 2/5th Staffordshire Bty) 6 x 18-pdrs * C/CCXCV (2/3rd Lincolnshire Bty + Section 2/6th Staffordshire Bty) 6 x 18-pdrs * D (H)/CCXCV (2/1st Derbyshire Bty + Left Section C (H)/CCLXXXVI Bty) 6 x 4.5-inch howitzers 59th Division began crossing to France on 17 February 1917 and concentrated around M√©ricourt. The last unit arrived on 17 March, the day the Germans began their retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich). The brigade immediately took part in following this retreat in March and April.Bradbridge, pp. 90‚Äì2, 118‚Äì9. 3rd Ypres The 59th Division took part in following the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line in March and April, but it was not until September that it was engaged in its first full-scale action, the phase of the 3rd Ypres Offensive known as the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. New artillery tactics involved five belts of fire, the first two fired by 18-pounders, the third by 4.5-inch howitzers, moving at a slow pace with frequent pauses to allow the infantry to keep up. Batteries also had the task of swinging off to engage targets of opportunity, and had spare detachments to avoid exhaustion of the gunners. The barrage was described as 'magnificent both in accuracy and volume', German counterattacks were broken up by shellfire, and the attack was a resounding success.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 205‚Äì8.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres', in Liddle, pp. 219‚Äì222.Wolff, pp. 187‚Äì95. > The next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September), was equally successful, with 176th (2/1st Staffordshire) Brigade advancing steadily behind its barrage onto the final objectives.Edmonds, 1917, pp. 288‚Äì9.Wolff, p. 199. Bourlon Wood 59th Division was next moved south to join in the Battle of Cambrai. The division entered the recently captured line between Cantaing and Bourlon Wood on 28 November. Fierce German counter-attacks began on 30 November. Two infantry assaults were made against 176th Brigade, but both attacks were easily broken up under British artillery fire.Miles, pp. 167, 213.Farndale, p. 255. By 4 December the decision had been made to withdraw from the Bourlon Salient, and 59th Division held covering positions while this was carried out. On 7 December the British were back on the line that they would hold for the coming winter.Miles, pp. 226, 262‚Äì7. Spring Offensive When the German Spring Offensive began on 21 March 1918 (the Battle of St Quentin), 59th Division was holding the Bullecourt Salient, squarely in the path of the German thrust. Its two field artillery brigades (CCXCV and CCXCVI (2/II NM)) were bolstered by the presence of XXVI Army Field Artillery Brigade.XXVI AFA Bde at Long, Long Trail. The British knew the attack was coming: from 02.00 that morning CCXCV Bde had been firing 'counter-preparation' tasks, but the must was so thick that one battery could barely see the gunflashes of its neighbour. From 05.00 the front line and forward gun positions came under very heavy enemy fire. The situation soon became desperate, the forward infantry brigades were almost totally destroyed, and the reserves moving up were swamped. The division's field guns in the forward zone were captured after firing over open sights at the advancing Germans. Word trickled back that the forward guns of D (H)/CCXCV and 116/XXVI Btys had fired off all their ammunition and blown up their guns. The rear guns engaged the advancing enemy as they emerged from the mist towards the gun positions, which were defended by rear details, including the gunners using rifles and Lewis guns, until the next defence line behind could be prepared.Major Bates, D/295 Bty, in Bradbridge, pp. 79‚Äì81.Blaxland, p. 48.Farndale, p. 265.Middlebrook, pp. 192‚Äì3, 232‚Äì4, 254‚Äì5, 270. At 18.30 that day, Major W.P.J. Akerman, the officer commanding A/CCXCV Bty, was put in command of the remnants of the three field artillery brigades. His force consisted of:Major W.P.J. Akerman, A/295 Bty, in Bradbridge, pp. 82‚Äì5. * 117/XXVI Bty ‚Äì 6 guns * A/CCXCV Bty - 6 guns * B/CCXCV Bty - 2 guns * A/CCXCVI Bty - 6 guns These guns engaged the enemy at first light the next day as they fought their way into Mory, and were still action at 21.00 in front of Divisional HQ at Behagnies. During the night of 22/23 March Akerman pulled his guns back to a position north west of Gomiecourt to fire in the Mory‚ÄìErvillers‚ÄìBehagnies area, covering the defence line that the surviving brigades of 59th Division were endeavouring to establish. XXVI Brigade came under the command of 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, and CCXCV and CCXCVI under 178th (2/1st Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire) Brigade. During the afternoon C/CCXCV Bty got six guns back into action, and D (H)/CCXCVI received three new howitzers that day. Late in the day Akerman was ordered to retire at once to Courcelles, but his own patrols reported all quiet, so he did not withdraw until 14.00 when the infantry retired. Through the following days of the Battle of Bapaume and the 'Great Retreat', the remaining batteries of 59th Divisional Artillery remained in action under the command of 40th Division. Although the rest of 59th Division was withdrawn, its artillery remained in the front line, under the command of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, with which it fought at the Battles of Arras (28 March) and the Ancre (5 April). Reconstruction 59th Division, without its artillery, was back in the line on 14 April, when it was again in the path of a German offensive (the Battle of Bailleul) and remnants took part in the 1st Battle of Kemmel Ridge (17‚Äì18 April). By now, 59th Division's infantry had been almost destroyed. The units were reduced to training cadres and the division was later reconstructed with garrison battalions. Until June, it was employed in digging rear defences, then it underwent training to enable it to hold a sector of the front line. On 25 July the reconstructed division went back into the line, and on 21 August it once more took part in active operations. However, the Divisional Artillery (CCXCV and CCXCVI Bdes) remained in the line, serving with various formations as required: 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division (15‚Äì24 April and 17 May‚Äì19 June), 37th Division (24 April‚Äì17 May), XVIII Corps (23 June‚Äì1 July), 5th Division (1‚Äì8 August) and 61st (2nd South Midland) Division (8‚Äì26 August). Advance to Victory 59th Divisional Artillery rejoined its parent division on 27 August 1918. From 2 October until 11 November 1918 the division participated in the final advance in Artois and Flanders. On 2 October, 59th Division ordered two minor operations in which detachments advanced under cover of smoke and a creeping barrage; these determined that the enemy had retired, and so the division advanced against little opposition.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 126‚Äì7. On 16 October, the division fought its way through the old defences of Lille, and liberated the city against minimal opposition the following day.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 408‚Äì13. Opposition stiffened at the River Schelde was approached, but this was crossed in early November.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 419‚Äì23, 543‚Äì5. The Armistice on 11 November found the division astride the Schelde north of Tournai. It moved to the coast to operate demobilisation centres at Dieppe, Dunkirk and Calais in early 1919, and to train drafts for continued service in Egypt and the Black Sea. 59th Divisional Artillery including CCXCV Brigade, was demobilised on 8 August 1919. Interwar years After the war, the unit was reconstituted as the 1st North Midland Brigade RFA (TA) in the reformed Territorial Army, with two Lincolnshire Batteries and two from the former Leicestershire Royal Horse Artillery and Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery, and the headquarters moved to Nottingham. Once more the unit formed part of the 46th (North) Midland Division. In 1921, the unit was designated 60th (North Midland) Brigade, RFA (TA), changing to 60th (North Midland) Field Brigade, RA (TA) in 1924 when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA). From then until 1938, the unit had the following organisation:Litchfield, pp. 138, 197.Titles & Designations 1927. * HQ Derby Road, Nottingham * 237th (Lincolnshire) Bty, Old Barracks, Lincoln * 238th (Lincolnshire) Bty (Howitzers), Augustus Street, Grimsby * 239th (Leicestershire) Bty 19 Magazine Street, Leicester * 240th (Nottinghamshire RHA) Bty, Derby Road, Nottingham The bulk of 46th (North Midland) Division was converted into 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division in December 1935, and 60th (North Midland) left to become an Army Field Brigade in Northern Command. After the Munich Crisis in 1938, the TA was doubled in size and in October 1938 the RA adopted a new establishment for field regiments (as brigades were now termed). For the 60th (North Midland), this meant that the Leicester and Nottingham batteries left in early 1939 to form a separate unit, the 115th Field Regiment based in Leicester. 60th (North Midland) Field Regiment now consisted of the two Lincolnshire batteries, 237 at Lincoln and 239 (later 238) at Grimsby, and the regimental headquarters (RHQ) moved to Lincoln.Litchfield, p. 139.Northern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.Sainsbury, pp. 60‚Äì1; Appendix 2. (For some reason, the new regiment initially took the battery numbers 237 and 239, while the 115th took 238 and 240, even though the original 238 had been a Lincolnshire battery based at Grimsby. The logical numbering was only restored by an order of the Adjutant-General's office on 11 August 1941.115 Fd Rgt RA War Diary 1939‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/1527.) The establishment of a field regiment was now two batteries each of three troops of four guns, giving a total of 24 guns. These were still World War I 18-pounders re-equipped with pneumatic tyres and towed by motor tractors.Ellis, Appendix I. World War II =Battle of France= An 18-Pounder being inspected in France, April 1940. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, 60th (North Midland) Army Field Regiment mobilised at Lincoln and Grimsby, trained at Bordon Camp, and crossed to France to join the British Expeditionary Force on 7 January 1940 under the command of Lt-Col F.P. Hallifax. As an army regiment, it was assigned by GHQ to II Corps, which in turn assigned it to support 5th Division. The division was in GHQ Reserve when the 'Phoney War' ended with the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May.Joslen, p. 462. The BEF followed the pre-arranged Plan D and advanced into Belgium to take up defences along the Dyle, with 5th Division moving up behind this line. However, the collapse of the Dutch forces and the German Army's rapid breakthrough in the Ardennes soon threatened the BEF's positions. The BEF began to withdraw to the Escaut, with 5th Division moving into GHQ Reserve at Seclin. Between 21 and 23 May, the BEF retired again to the canals along the Franco-Belgian frontier. By now, it was cut off from the rest of France, and 5th Division was holding a dangerous salient around Arras and had passed to III Corps. 5th Division was due to counter-attack southwards, but on 25 May the BEF's Commander-in-Chief, Lord Gort, ordered it northwards instead, to plug a dangerous gap near Ypres. There it came under heavy attack for three days and was supported by all available corps artillery.Ellis, pp. 39, 49, 74, 121, 139, 149, 171, 194.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 34, 39, 45, 62, 70, Maps 12, 15, 18. The decision to evacuate the BEF through Dunkirk (Operation Dynamo) was made on 26 May, and 5th Division's stand helped to maintain the north-eastern front of the shrinking 'pocket' as troops streamed towards the port. It withdrew to the inner perimeter of the bridgehead on the night of 29/30 May. Once inside the bridgehead, all remaining guns and equipment were destroyed, and the troops took their turn to wait for boats to take them back to Southern England. The bulk of II Corps was evacuated on 31 May/1 June.Ellis, pp. 201‚Äì5, 216‚Äì7, 225, 231. After reaching England, 60th Army Fd Rgt was assigned to XII Corps holding the vital area of South-East England, though equipment was very scarce, particularly field guns.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 95, 103, Annex D.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery, 26 December 1940, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, files WO 212/4 and WO 33/2365.Collier, pp. 127, 130, Map 17. Once the regiment had been re-equipped with modern 25-pounder field gun-howitzers, it was rostered for overseas service (together with its Signal Section of the Royal Corps of Signals) and left Home Forces in late February 1941. It reached Egypt in May, and immediately sent C troop of 237 Fd Bty to reinforce the garrison of Cyprus.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 198. =Iraq and Syria= 25-pounder in action during the advance into Syria, 13 June 1941. After a German-backed coup d'√©tat in Iraq in April 1941, the Royal Air Force (RAF) training base at Habbaniya came under siege by Iraqi Nationalist forces. As soon as it arrived in the Middle East, 60th Fd Rgt was sent up to Palestine to join the relief column, known as 'Habforce'. Brigadier 'Joe' Kingstone was sent on ahead with a Flying column named 'Kingcol' to effect a relief of the airbase as soon as possible. The field artillery component of Kingcol was provided by the 25-pounders of 237 Fd Bty.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex F.Smith, pp. 174‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 177‚Äì87.H. Stafford Northcote, 'Revolt in the Desert', in Purnell's History of the Second World War, pp. 540‚Äì9.Iraq May 1941 at RA 39‚Äì45. Kingcol operated as a self- contained unit with 12 days' rations and five days' water. It moved out from Transjordan following the Amman‚ÄìBaghdad road and Mosul‚ÄìHaifa oil pipeline to the fort of Rutba, which had been recaptured by the Arab Legion and 2nd Armoured Car Squadron, RAF, on 10 May. Kingcol moved on from Rutba on 15 May, crossing the desert in exceptionally hot weather, digging the heavy vehicles out when they broke through the surface of the poor tracks, and under attack by German aircraft. The direct road to Habbaniya was blocked by Iraqi troops at Ramadi, but engineers from Habbaniya had bridged the canal to the south and Kingcol arrived from that direction on 18 May. 237 Battery went straight into action, firing across floodwaters at the Iraqi positions. Kingcol and the Habbaniya garrison now planned an attack on Fallujah, moving up both sides of the Euphrates (the Battle of Fallujah). A troop of six 25-pounders of 237 Bty accompanied the RAF's Assyrian Levies to advance from the south-west and seize the vital Euphrates bridge. On 19 May, the levies advanced over open boggy ground, covered by the fire of the 25-pounders, and crossed and captured the bridge in only half an hour. The Iraqis counter-attacked on 22 May, but the British and Assyrian troops fought back ferociously and the Iraqis withdrew. The British now prepared to advance on Baghdad in two small columns, each accompanied by a troop of 25-pounders. Kingcol advancing on the south side was held up by Iraqi 18-pounders, but these were engaged by 237 Bty, allowing the British troops to work their way forward. Rumour magnified the size of these small forces, and the Iraqis asked for an armistice on 30 May.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 193.Smith, p. 180.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 187‚Äì97. In mid-June, Habforce (including 237 Bty) joined the campaign against Vichy French forces in Syria. Its role was to advance across the desert from Iraq towards Palmyra. F Troop saw action at Oumm Ovalid with the Transjordan Frontier Force. Habforce's advance was continually harried by Vichy Air Force attacks. Meanwhile, 6th Division, which had recently been reformed in Egypt, had been sent up to handle the advance from Palestine toward Damascus, supported by the rest of 60th Fd Rgt. 1st Battalion Royal Fusiliers captured Quneitra with 25-pounder support, but the guns had then been withdrawn and the Vichy forces later re-took the town, capturing most of the Fusiliers. A troop of 60th Fd Rgt regiment supported 2nd Battalion, Queen's Regiment of 6th Division in a cross-country movement to retake it once more on 17 June. On 30 June, D Troop broke up an enemy counter-attack and destroyed four armoured vehicles. After the fall of Damascus and Palmyra, the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign ended on 14 July with the Armistice of Saint Jean d'Acre.H. Stafford Northcote, 'Desert Tragedy: The Conquest of Vichy Syria', in Purnell's History of the Second World War, pp. 550‚Äì60.Joslen, pp. 49‚Äì50.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 209‚Äì14.Smith, pp. 221‚Äì32, 236, 246‚Äì50.Syria June 1941 at RA 39‚Äì45. =Western Desert= 25-pounder and Quad tractor moving up to the front in the Western Desert. On 20 July 1941, the regiment joined 6th Division, which was being built up but did not yet have a full artillery complement. However, during September the infantry units of 6th Division began to be shipped into the besieged Libyan port of Tobruk (where it was renamed 70th Division as a deception) leaving the artillery behind, and 60th Fd Rgt left the division on 30 September, reverting to being an army field regiment under Eighth Army in Egypt.Joslen, p. 486.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 2, 25. Eighth Army was preparing a new offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Crusader) to drive the Axis forces back from the Egyptian Frontier across Cyrenaica and to relieve Tobruk. For this operation, 60th Fd Rgt was assigned as an additional regiment to 7th Support Group in 7th Armoured Division (a support group at this time was essentially an artillery brigade acting as the pivot group within an armoured division).Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 206‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol III, p. 45. The operation began at dawn on 18 November 1941, achieving surprise and taking almost all its first day objectives. The next day, 7th Armoured Division began exploitation towards Sidi Rezegh, and on 20 November 7th Support Group was ordered up to join the leading armoured brigade at Sidi Rezegh. On 21 November, 7th Armoured Division with its support group advanced northwards to meet 70th Division breaking out of Tobruk, but both Panzer divisions of the Afrika Korps intervened and bitter fighting broke out (the Battle of Sidi Rezegh). 7th Support Group under Brigadier Jock Campbell attacked Sidi Rezegh with tank support, but came under tank and artillery fire from the north and suffered badly. At one point, 50 German tanks passed through the 7th Hussars to attack S Company and Battalion HQ of 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade but were driven off by anti-tank guns of J Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) and the 25-pounders of 60th Fd Rgt. The RHA detachment fought to the last gun, winning a Victoria Cross (VC) and the Honour title 'Sidi Rezegh' for their battery. Meanwhile, 60th Fd Rgt, deployed round the edge of Sidi Rezegh airfield, were in contact a point-blank range but kept firing despite rising casualties. As about 40 panzers advanced directly towards the guns, one Troop of the regiment moved out onto the airfield itself but was overrun. The RA historian records that 'the whole area was filled with blazing hulks, solid shot ran out and anything to hand was fired'. At dawn the following day the defenders of Sidi Rezegh could see a mass of some 80 tanks and support vehicles advancing against them some three miles away. 60th Field Regiment was very short of men, but Brigadier Campbell himself helped the gunners swing the trails of their guns round to engage these targets, before bringing up a squadron of tanks. This attack was dispersed. Later he stood on the wing of a crashed Italian aircraft to direct the guns of 60th Fd Rgt to scatter another attack. The Afrika Korps then redirected its attack to the east and overran two infantry companies from the rear: once again Campbell helped swing the guns round to face this attack. At the end of the day the regiment was exhausted, but the Germans had never been able to close in. Campbell was later awarded the VC.Lt-Gen Sir Geofrey Evans, 'Crusader: Auchinleck recovers Cyrenaica', in Purnell's History of the Second World War, pp. 740‚Äì53.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 210‚Äì14; Maps 45‚Äì9.Hughes, pp. 188‚Äì90.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 38‚Äì49, Maps 7‚Äì8. Brigadier Jock Campbell won a VC while directing the guns of 60th Fd Rgt at Sid Rezegh On 23 November, 15th Panzer Division cut through 7th Support Group's positions on its way west, scattering the support group's vehicles. Then the following day General Erwin Rommel disengaged the Afrika Korps and made a 'dash for the [Egyptian] frontier' in Eighth Army's rear. 7th Support Group was able to engage the flank of this column as it passed by, then broke up into small raiding columns to attack the German rear and then prevent the Italian Ariete Division joining in. By now, 60th Fd Rgt only had 14 of its 24 guns left. By 28 November, Rommel was stopped at the frontier and returned westwards, Sidi Rezegh was secured, and the encirclement of Tobruk was broken.Farndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 218‚Äì21, Map 50.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 49, 53‚Äì64, Maps 9‚Äì11. Camouflaged 25-pounder in the Western Desert. The confused fighting continued as the returning Afrika Korps attacked again in the Sidi Rezegh area, but 7th Support Group engaged the Ariete Division at Bir el Gubi and prevented its participation (4 December).Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 222, Map 51.Playfair, Vol III, p. 75, Map 14. Rommel decided to retire to Gazala on 7 December and Eighth Army followed up to clear Cyrenaica. While the positions round Gazala and Alem Hamza were attacked on 15 December, 7th Support Group was ordered to deal with any enemy in the open country to the south of Sidi Breghisc. The group reached Tengeder on 17 December and then turned north towards Mechili, which convinced Rommel to pull back with all speed to the Tripolitania border before he was cut off by this flanking movement. By 20 December 7th Support Group had reached Charruba and was in contact with the rear of the Ariete and Trieste Divisions, though the going had got rough and petrol was scarce. It struggled forward to a point 15 miles south of Sceleidima by 22 DecemberFarndale, Years of Defeat, pp. 225‚Äì8, Maps 52, 54.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 81, 84‚Äì8, Maps 15, 16. On 22 December, 7th Armoured Division was relieved; its Support Group 'was only a shadow of its former self', and 60th Fd Rgt left to refit. It rejoined 70th Division (ex-6th Division) on 31 December 1941. 70th Division moved to Syria for rest on 7 February 1942, but the Fall of Singapore on 15 February led to an urgent call for reinforcements to be sent from Middle East Forces to the Far East. 70th Division was ordered to India on 17 February, and sailed from Egypt on 28 February, arriving at Bombay on 10 March.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 228.Farndale , Far East, Annex J.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 126, 199.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 56‚Äì7, 110. =Far East= On arrival in India, 70th Division went to Ranchi as part of a mobile reserve for introduction into the Burma Campaign as required. This would not be until after the Monsoon rains ended in late 1942.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 194‚Äì5, 235. As early as October 1940, it had been planned that field regiments would adopt an organisation of three eight-gun batteries, but shortages meant that in most units this reorganisation was not completed for many months. By November 1942, 60th Fd Rgt had organised 442 Fd Bty.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 99. 70th Division remained at Ranchi during the first part of 1943. It was then decided to break it up to provide Long Range Penetration (LRP or 'Chindit') columns for Maj-Gen Orde Wingate's second jungle penetration mission (Operation Thursday).Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 390, 398‚Äì404. 70th Division began reorganising on 6 September 1943. The Chindits had no role for conventional artillery, so 60th Fd Rgt joined 23rd Brigade on 22 October 1943 to train as infantry under the designation of 60th Regiment, RA, (North Midland). Each infantry battalion reorganised as two LRP Columns; 60th Rgt provided Columns 60 and 88. 23 Brigade moved to Indias's Central Provinces for intensive training in jungle fighting.Joslen, pp. 267‚Äì8.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 37‚Äì8, Appendix 16. The CO of 60th Fd Rgt is reported to have resigned in protest at the conversion to infantry, and was replaced by Lt-Col H.G. de J. ('Mike') du Vallon, a specialist in LRP tactics, who trained the regiment and commanded one of the columns in person. The other column was commanded by Major Neil Hotchkin, son of the regiment's Honorary Colonel and a noted first class cricketer, who had first been commissioned into the regiment as a 2nd Lieutenant in 237 Bty on 26 September 1936.Thomas Joesbury, '60 and 80 (sic) Column Chindits 1944' at Burma Star Association.Hotchkin obituary, Daily Telegraph 10 February 2004.Hotchkin at Cricinfo. Operation Thursday began on 5 February 1944 with the first LRP brigades moving into Burma to establish bases for the fly-in of the second wave. 23 Brigade was in reserve for later in the operation, but the Japanese U-Go Offensive against Imphal and Kohima changed the situation, and on 8 March the brigade was reassigned to Fourteenth Army. It was moved up to Hailakandi and then Mariani in Assam to be used in a short range penetration role.Arthur Swinson, 'Wingate's Last Campaign', in Purnell's History of the Second World War, pp. 2049‚Äì57.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 174, 177, 183, 192, 197, 199‚Äì200, 241, 299‚Äì300. As Operation Thursday began to turn sour, Wingate's replacement as commander of Special Force requested 23 Brigade, but instead the brigade marched into Burma on 3 April 1944 to defend the routes into Assam and cover the northern flank of Fourteenth Army in its counter-offensive towards Kohima. As the brigade advanced, it found elements of the Japanese 124th Regiment covering the flank of the 31st Division. These flank guards, aided by storms, dense jungle, and precipitous mountains, imposed considerable delays on 23 Brigade's advance towards Jessami. After the Relief of Kohima the British continued towards Imphal, still with 23 Brigade as flank guard on the Kharasom‚ÄìUkhrul axis, with the task of cutting Japanese communications back to the Chindwin River.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 280‚Äì1, 302‚Äì6, 351, Sketch 14. On 22 April, 60 and 88 columns started out into the Naga Hills. Some of the zig-zag tracks up the mountainsides and across the rivers were so narrow that no vehicles or even pack animals could use them, and the columns relied on Naga porters for transport. The Monsoon rains were exceptionally heavy, and most of the men suffered from 'Naga Hills tummy': dysentery brought on by magnesium sulfate (the laxative known as 'Epsom Salts') in the water. By 13 May, 60 Column had reached Meluri, where they established a firm base and supply-dropping point. The following day, 88 Column arrived, and with the porters began building a stronghold named 'Grimsby', and cut a landing-strip for aircraft. Although the tracks the columns had been sent to interdict were not actually being used by the Japanese, they were present at Jessami and Khanjan, which du Vallon decided to raid. After a difficult night approach, three platoons of 60 Column attacked Jessami and the reconnaissance platoons of both columns attacked Khanjan simultaneously at 06.00 on 18 May. Both places were cleared and numerous casualties caused; British wounded were evacuated from Grimsby by light aircraft. A company-strength Japanese position was discovered on 23 May a mile south of Jessami, and two platoons made a probing attack. Later, the Japanese were bombed by Hurricane fighter-bombers and left the area. Aerial reconnaissance from Grimsby by du Vallon and Hotchkin identified a suitable site for the next firm base, named 'Grimbsy II' at Nungphung, where four important tracks met. On 24 May, 60 Column began constructing another airstrip two miles from the village, which was occupied by 88 Column. Grimsby II was a vulnerable position, only 6 miles from a Japanese garrison at Kharasom, and the columns had to fight off a determined attack on 31 May. After that, they were not troubled, even though the garrisons at Grimsby II were dangerously small when platoons were on offensive operations, possibly because the Nagas fed the Japanese false information about the strength of the columns. Supply drops every three days brought in quantities of barbed wire, flares and explosives with which to defend the positions, as well as ammunition and rations. Over the next three weeks, aggressive patrols by platoons from Grimsby II and Jessami harassed the Japanese communications round Kharasom, suffering minimal casualties, although a significant number of sick had to be evacuated by air. On 15 June, the two columns received their orders for the last phase of the operation: the pursuit of the enemy to Ukhrul. They called in all their patrols and their mules and muleteers rejoined. Significant numbers of the men were deemed unfit for the operation and were evacuated from Grimsby II on 22 June. 23 Brigade was ready to take part in a concentric attack by XXXIII Corps against Ukhrul, but this was held up by torrential rain, and did not begin until 27 June. The following day, four columns of the brigade began moving eastwards towards Fort Keary and the other four towards Ukhrul. In this part of the encirclement, the main obstacles were climate and terrain. The columns struggled through rain and cloying mud along treacherous mountain tracks, from sub-tropical heat in valley bottoms to cold mists on the mountain tops. The troops often went hungry when air supply drops were impossible, and sickness took hold among the undernourished and exhausted men. Organised Japanese resistance ended on 8 July and the columns fanned out along the tracks to the Chindwin, past dead and dying Japanese troops and abandoned equipment. Further pursuit would have exposed the British troops to greater risks of sickness, and so the brigade was gradually withdrawn from the Chindwin. By the end of July, 23 Brigade was on its way back to India.Woodburn Kirby, Vol III, pp. 357, 361, 363‚Äì4, 371. 60th Regiment went to Bangalore for rest and reorganisation. On 29 October 1944, it was broken up, the surviving fit men being posted to 2nd Battalion Queen's Regiment, alongside which it had fought in Syria, and which had returned from Operation Thursday. The RA regiment was placed in suspended animation.Woodburn Kirby, Vol IV, p. 27. 60th (North Midland) Field Regiment was never reformed, and was officially disbanded in 1947.

Description His band was semi-nomadic, living in semi-permanent, grass-thatched, wattle-and-daub houses, and roamed throughout the Utah Lake area as well as Sanpete and Sevier counties. Together with Chief Tabby-To-Kwanah, they led seasonal migrations through the canyon each spring and fall. His daughter Pomona (Pamamaci = \\"Water-woman\\") married the mountain man, Miles Goodyear. Peteetneet is the anglicized corruption of Pah-ti't-ni't, which in Timpanogos means \\"our water place\\".Sapir, Edward. 1930.

In February 1850, his village was attacked by the Mormon militia, as part of the Battle at Fort Utah. Although Peteetneet was not there at the time of the attack, he did confront the soldiers at Fort Utah after finding the bodies of several decapitated Indians. When the first Mormon pioneers arrived on Peteeneet Creek in late October, 1850, they found that Chief Peteetneet was friendly, along with his band of about 200 Timpanogos. The Mormon pioneers settled on an uninhabited section of the creek about a mile southeast of Peteetneet's village. It is unlikely that the settlement on Peteetneet Creek would have survived the winter without the benevolence of Chief Peteetneet and his band.Pace, James Edward. 1946.

Smith gave him talking papers that certified \\"it is my desire that they [Captain Walker and Peteetneet] should be treated as friends, and as they wish to Trade horses, Buckskins and Piede children, we hope them success and prosperity and good bargains.\\" Chief Peteetneet died on December 23, 1861, under somewhat mysterious circumstances in Cedar Valley, Utah, near recently abandoned Fort Crittenden (Camp Floyd). He was buried on the mountainside in Cedar Valley by members of his band. His wife, murdered by an axe-wielding woman in his band on express orders near his deathbed, was buried in the valley below his grave in order to accompany him into the afterlife.Editor. 1862. Death of Chief Peteetneet. Deseret News, 1 January 1862.

They represent attendees of a diverse range of types of institutions. Whether by race, culture, or social class, first- generation college students often experience some kind of mismatch between their home environment and the college environment.

Fryburg, and Camille S. Johnson. \\"Unseen Disadvantage: How American Universities' Focus on Independence Undermines the Academic Performance of First-Generation College Students.\\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 102, no. 6 (June 2012): 1178‚Äì197.

These students' likelihood to attend college in the first place is highly influenced by their parents' education level; when a parent's education level is higher, the student is likely to enroll in postsecondary education increases as well.Choy, S., (2001).

Population trends  As reported by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 33.5% of undergraduate students had parents whose highest level of education was high school or less in the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. = Age and dependency status = In 2014 the NCES reported that the following percentages of college students by age had parents whose highest education level was high school or less.U.S. Department of Education. (2014, October). National Center for Education Statistics [NCES]. \\"Web table: Profile of Undergraduate Students 2011‚Äì2012\\". * 27.5% of students 18 years old or younger * 27.4% of students 19‚Äì23 years old * 35.6% of students 24‚Äì29 years old * 42.1% of students 30‚Äì39 years old * 50.2% of students 40 years old or older A review of the literature on first-generation college students published by the Texas Guaranteed Student Load Corporation (TGSLC) cites a 2001 study which reported that 31% of first-generation college students were 24 years of age or older. A 1998 study cited in the same review reported that 13% of first-generation college students were 30 years of age or older. Additionally, 46% did not start attending college immediately after high school graduation. 37% were not dependents, and 18% were married. The NCES report for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year states the shares of undergraduate students whose parents' highest level of education was high school or less by dependency and marriage status. * 25.4% of dependent students * 41.3% of independent students * 35.6% of students who are unmarried without dependents * 37.5% of students who are married without dependents * 47.5% of students who are unmarried with dependents * 44.0% of students who are married with dependents = Employment = According to the NCES report for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, the share of undergraduate full-time employed undergraduate students whose parents' highest education level was high school or less was 38.0%. This is slightly higher than the share of undergraduate students who did not work while enrolled whose parents' highest education level was high school or less (34.1%). The share of part-time employed undergraduate students whose parents' highest education level was high school or less was 29.6%. Many first generation students are forced to work to pay for their tuition. = Race = The NCES reported these percentages of undergraduate college students whose parents had a high school diploma or less for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year: * 47.8% of Hispanic students * 42.0% of Black African-American students * 39.6% of American Indian students * 32.9% of Asian students * 27.9% of White students * 24.6% of Pacific Islander students * 23.9% of students of two or more races = Type of institution = The NCES report by Redford and Hoyer following students who were high school sophomores in 2002 states that 76% of first-generation college students first enrolled in public, 9% in private, and 16% in for-profit institutions. Regarding the selectively of institutions where first-generation college students tend to enroll, the same NCES report states that 52% enrolled in 2-year institutions whose selectively is unclassified. Students enrolled at moderately selective 4-year institutions comprised 16%, at inclusive 4-year institutions 9%, at unclassified 4-year institutions 9%, at unclassified less than two-year institutions 9%, and at highly selective 4-year institutions 6% of the total first-generation college student population. The NCES 2011‚Äì2012 school year data shows that almost half of undergraduates enrolled in for-profit institutions have parents whose highest level of education was high school or less. Students whose parents' highest education level was high school or less also represented: * 33.0% of undergraduates at public universities * 56.2% of undergraduates at less that 2-year public universities * 38.3% of undergraduates at 2-year public universities * 25.9% of undergraduates at 4-year public universities * 23.1% of undergraduates at private nonprofit universities  Adult students' experiences  Through interviews with first-generation college students older than 25 at a small liberal arts college, researchers Kathleen Byrd and Ginger Macdonald found that these students considered their age to be a positive contributor to their time management and self-advocacy skills. Having more experience navigating life and work contributed to their confidence. Some interviewees expressed that their self-advocacy skills in particular had helped to compensate for what they lacked in background knowledge, or cultural capital, of the college system in areas such as financial aid, student advising services, and student-professor relationships. Interviewees who were also parents cited their children as sources of motivation in their academic pursuits. In contrast to younger first-generation college students who may perceive their education as surpassing their parents, older first-generation college students may perceive their education in terms of being a role model for their children. = Online learning = According to a study of adult first-generation and continuing-generation online college students by Susan Dumais et al., most adult online learners, regardless of parent education level, are confident that they will succeed academically. However, ways that first-generation adult online learners differed from their continuing- generation counterparts in the study included \\"greater intrinsic motivation\\" to earn their degree and more usage of built-in student support services. Additionally, the first-generation students reported having more demanding work environments and less support from their employers to balance their work responsibilities with their family and academic responsibilities.  Social class and mobility  In an article from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Stephens et al. observe that the institution of higher education in the United States of America is popularly viewed as an environment of equal opportunity regardless of social class background and a means for social mobility. Indeed, a 2002 report by Connie Ayala and Al Striplen cited in the TGSLC literature review asserts that first-generation college students are involved in a \\"deliberate attempt\\" to achieve upward social, economic, or occupational mobility. However, research by Jean Phinney et al. explain that first-generation college students' motivations for attending college also include helping one's family and responding to encouragement from others in addition to personal/career motivations.Phinney, J., Dennis, J., & Osorio, S. (in press). Motivations to attend college among college students from diverse ethnic and social class backgrounds. Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology. A study by Rebecca Covarrubias and Stephanie Fryburg equates first-generation college student status with a working-class family background and the university as a middle class environment. = Cultural capital = Stephens et al. show that working class and middle class societies have differing cultural capital and norms, and these differences are present in the way each class approaches and values higher education as well. The \\"cultural mismatch\\" between the college environment and first-generation college students' working-class backgrounds can be a source of academic disadvantage. Middle class students are typically socialized to value independence, and they are encouraged to approach college with the intention to \\"separate and distinguish themselves from their parents..., to find themselves, to develop their voices, to follow their passions, and to influence the world\\". On the other hand, working class students are often socialized to value interdependence, such as by \\"adjusting and responding to others' needs\\" and \\"being a part of a community\\", and may view college through a lens of interdependence as well. The article shows how American first and second tier universities included in their study do indeed reflect the middle class values of independence, creating a mismatch between the environment familiar to students of working-class backgrounds and the college environment. Stephens et al. propose that American institutions of higher education should broaden their cultures to include messages that accept and encourage interdependence so to mitigate academic disadvantages due to cultural mismatch. = Social capital = Rice et al., in an article in the journal Counseling Psychology Quarterly, conducted qualitative interviews with 14 first-generation college students to better understand the social class worldview and identity of first-generation college students from the students' own perspectives. When attempting to label their own social class, terms of social and cultural capital were more relevant than formal indicators of social class such as income, education, and occupation. According to Stephens et al., first- generation college students' tendency to have different social capital than those they are surrounded by in the college environment makes it difficult for them to feel comfortable at college. For example, first-generation college students may not have relationships with college graduates, or they may lack a sense of belonging among their classmates. In addition some African American students have shown to be reluctant to seek help from school counselors, and instead seek spiritual guidance. Some of the interviewees found that shared life experiences allowed them to bond with and feel comfortable around each other despite social class differences. Studies show that the strongest predictors for college attendance and completion are academic preparation, social support, access to information, parental involvement and knowledge about college, and financial aid. Another form of social support is the prevalence of strong social networks that support a student's academic and emotional development. Federally funded programs such as Upward Bound, Talent Search, Gear Up, and non-profit organizations such as AVID have been implemented at the secondary level to prepare first-generation students for college through academic counseling, college field trips, study skill development, and support from college graduates. = Classism = In the Rice et al. article, classism is defined as the belief that all members of a certain social class possess certain characteristics inherent to that class. Many of the interviewees found it hard to recall specific experiences of classism, but nevertheless experienced being generally \\"looked down upon\\". Non-white first generation college students in the study would sometimes refer to their experiences using racial or ethnic terms interchangeably with class terms, showing that dimensions of their identities are not separable from one another. Indeed, an article by Jessica Harris and Chris Linder discusses abundant literature reporting on the high prevalence of racial micro- agrression against graduate students of color within the university which becomes normalized due to its commonness.Harris, Jessica, and Chris Linder. \\"The Racialized Experiences of Students of Color in Higher Education and Student Affairs Graduate Preparation Programs.\\" Journal of College Student Development 59, no. 2 (March/April 2018): 140‚Äì58. . The interviewees also acknowledged stereotypes of students of higher classes, including that they do not work as hard or value their education as much as less affluent students. = Students of rural and agricultural background = Patrick Shultz conducted a study consisting of in-depth interviews with six first-year first-generation college students with both rural and agricultural backgrounds.Schultz, Patrick. \\"Upon Entering College: First Semester Experiences of First- Generation, Rural Students from Agricultural Families.\\" The Rural Educator 26, no. 1 (Fall 2004): 48‚Äì51. Many of these students associated their agricultural backgrounds with their hard-working character, which in many cases, helped the students maintain confidence that they could work hard to persist through the challenges of college too. Sometimes, these students perceived that their peers at college did not share their past of having to work as hard as they had, which could make building relationships with these student's counterparts more challenging. Their agricultural background was a source of pride and identity which also set them apart as multidimensionally \\"different\\" from their peers. = The Talented Tenth = Battle and Wright, in their quantitative assessment of W.E.B. Du Bois's \\"Talented Tenth\\" in the Journal of Black Studies, discuss the conversation around higher education that took place among black intellectual leaders in the post-Reconstruction era. Du Bois's philosophy was that the cohort of emancipated slaves who would go on to become college educated, or the \\"Talented Tenth\\", had a responsibility to become leaders and advocates for the whole of the African American community. Du Bois wanted institutions of higher education to be a means by which the \\"humanity of African Americans\\" as a whole would be \\"recognize[d]\\". Later in his life, Du Bois expressed disappointment in the Talented Tenth, accusing them of using their education for personal gain and losing solidarity with the rest of the black community. = Financial issues = A problem that first generation students face, more frequently than other students is lack of finance with the constant growing cost of college. The cost of college often increases as students move through college. A student who manages to pay through their first year of college may find difficulty moving past that year as prices typically increase. = Gender issues = According to a primary research study, first generation female students are experiencing high amounts of stress that is difficult to manage which can affect their progress in academics.  Family relationships  A 2014 study by Tiffany Wang in the Journal of Family Communication identified five thematic messages that 30 first-generation participants from a large public university received from their families.Wang, Tiffany R. I'm the Only Person From Where I'm From to Go to College': Understanding the Memorable Messages First-Generation College Students Receive From Parents.\\" Journal of Family Communication 14, no. 3 (2014): 270‚Äì90. . The first theme was \\"remembering family\\", which included messages about the importance of maintaining strong emotional connection with and loyalty to one's family and background. The second theme was \\"focusing on family\\", which included messages encouraging the student to prioritize the family highly. The third theme was \\"counting on family\\", which included messages guaranteeing unconditional support. Students who cited these messages also reflected that being at college had led them to cherish their family relationships more than in the past. The fourth theme was \\"not worrying about family\\", and included messages of assurance that the student had made the right choice in pursuing education even if sacrifices of responsibility to and time with the family had to be made. The fifth theme was \\"setting a good example\\", and included messages reminding the student of their responsibility to demonstrate maturity, hard work, and focus to younger family members and friends. More than 25% of first generation students attend junior college, and less than half of students parents doesn't attend college. Olson's literature review and research (2014) explores the unfamiliarity FGCS face when they navigate through their postsecondary education and the fact that they usually do this on their own. Olson cites how FGCS have been found to enter college with the expectation that it will lead to a high-paying or prestigious job, which are not guaranteed outcomes. Brooks-Terry (1998) explores FGCS go into college with faulty expectations and struggle with \\"double assignment\\",Brooks- Terry, M. (1988). \\"Tracing the disadvantages of first-generation college students: An application of Sussman's option sequence model.\\" In S. K. Steinmetz (Ed.), Family and support systems across the lifespan (pp. 121‚Äì134). New York, NY: Plenum Press. . which entail handling their courses while also learning and understanding the college lifestyle in general. Orbe (2008) explains that FGCS' understanding of the college culture becomes a \\"multidimensional identity negotiation\\"Orbe, M. P. (2008). \\"Theorizing multidimensional identity negotiation: Reflections on the Lived experiences of first-generation college students.\\" In M. Azmitia, M. Syed, & K. Radmacher (Eds.), New directions for child & adolescent development: No. 120. The intersections of personal and social identities (pp. 81‚Äì95). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. . against their home culture. FGCS have to acknowledge how they change in college while also relating that to their experiences with family and friends. Orbes mentions how FGCS might not even notice this, but their family and friends will acknowledge this change. The challenge comes with the accusations that the student has changed or is not remaining true to their culture, which further complicates their identity and belief in their potential to succeed. Additionally, Olson addresses the obstacles the FGCS faces when wanting to move out. London (1989) explains how families of FGCS assign roles to keep them grounded to their families. Families may delegate the FGCS as the example for other members of the family, or keep them at home so they can remain reliant on family. Their success then becomes validated by family approval as well as by completing their own goals. Furthermore, Olson applies SCCT when exploring self-efficacy in more depth. Bandura (1986) says that self-efficacy and success of FGCS may be \\"learned\\"Bandura, A. (1986). Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall. . by watching their peers fail in college. It is likely that their perspectives are not accurate, and their families lack of education experience negatively reinforces the notion that they will not succeed. Gibbons and Borders (2010) highlight that while FGCS may overcome many obstacles, they still have the notion that they are not as successful as they should have been. Regardless, SCCT predicts that if a FGCS has strong family support, they are more likely to believe in their personal goals and path to higher education and a stronger sense of self-efficacy.  Imposter phenomenon  A 2016 journal article by Patrick Whitehead and Robert Wright discusses research that has found associations between first-generation college students and experience of the imposter phenomenon. As described by Pauline Clance and Joe Langford, the imposter phenomenon is the internalization of the belief that one's luck, hard work, or manipulation of others is the source of one's success, not true competence. Furthermore, people experiencing imposter phenomenon feel pressure to maintain their successful persona and fear of failing to do so and being exposed as incompetent. In the context of first-generation college students, Whitehead and Wright found that the perception of one's college education as a process of \\"service to something greater\\" is a protective factor against not only imposter phenomenon, but other obstacles typically experienced by first- generation college students. Graduation rates DeAngeloDeAngelo, L., Franke, R., Hurtado, S., Pryor, J.H., & Tran, S. (2011). Completing college: Assessing graduation rates at four-year institutions. Los Angeles: Higher Education Research Institute, UCLA. provides statistics on graduation rates among FGCS and non-FGCS in a framework of four, five, and six years as well as a table that breaks down the degree attainment by race/ethnicity. These images from the study provide a breakdown, and show the huge gaps in degree attainment. A new study revealed that only 27 percent of first-generation students will earn a bachelor's degree within four years of entering college, lagging far behind their continuing-generation peers. Four, Five, and Six-year degree attainment rates by generation in college Four, Five, and Six-year degree attainment rates by race/ethnicity Obstacles to access In a 2001 US Department of Education report, Susan Choy explains that in order to becoming a college student requires a student proceed through multiple steps, starting with aspiring to earn a bachelor's degree, then achieving at least minimal academic preparation, then taking the SAT or ACT test, and finally, applying to a four-year institution.U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Students Whose Parents Did Not Go to College: Postsecondary Access, Persistence, and Attainment, NCES 2001-126, by Susan Choy. Washington, DC: 2001. Her report shows that as a students' parents' education level increases, so does the students' likelihood of completing each step along the way to enrollment at a four-year institution. Choy also reports that the likelihood that a students will enroll in a four-year higher education institution is highly correlated with taking more advanced math courses in high school. While students whose parents had less education were less likely to take more advanced math courses, the likelihood of enrolling in college for students whose parents did not go to college greatly increases with the level of math course they take, especially if they take algebra in 8th grade. Regarding the last step in the college enrollment process, application, the literature review by Carmen Tym et al. explains that first- generation college students are not as likely to receive help from their parents nor their schools. Additionally, prospective first-generation college students are less likely to have full access to internet, a highly useful tool for researching and applying to colleges. Because of a lack of experience, first-generation college students' parents do not always understand what the academic requirements are to attend a 4-year college; therefore they cannot prepare their children for admission to such universities or the stress of the college experience. First-generation past students now parents would advise their children different from how they were advised when they were college students, with the advice they wish they were given by their parents. Students must rely on their teachers and counselors to place them on the correct track in order to enroll in any form of post-secondary education. DeAngelo (et al., 2011) explains how prior academic achievements impact degree completion. These are explored through SAT scores and high school grades. FGCS with a higher- grade average in high school and SAT composite scores are more likely to graduate in 4 years. If these students don't understand the impact of their SAT scores and GPAs on their likelihood to graduate, they are not predisposed to take them seriously, while college experienced students know that based on their previous knowledge. By the results being shown, it suggest that the results of the supportive relationship within their community are usually associated with higher levels of satisfaction but not academic achievement as measured by grades. = Students of rural background = A study by Mara Casey Tieken discusses the tension that many students from rural backgrounds face when deciding whether to attend college. The choice between staying at home to working in a trade which does not require a college degree and pursuing an education which will likely result in that student permanently living away from where they grew up can be hard because of mixed expectations and hopes from the students themselves, their parents, and their advisors or mentors. Many of the students of agricultural background interviewed by Patrick Schultz made the decision to pursue post-secondary education in late high school. When a student's parents supported their pursuit of post-secondary education, the decision to attend college was much easier, but when parental support was absent, the decision was more likely to be conflicted and confusing.  Family achievement guilt  Family achievement guilt is defined by Rebecca Covarrubias, Andrea Romero, and Michael Trivelli as a student's feeling of guilt caused by having more academic opportunities and success compared to other family members. Geraldine Piorkowski has used the term \\"survivor's guilt\\" to describe these emotions after examining the impact of attending college on low-income, African American first-generation college students, as they felt like their academic success meant that they were abandoning their family and difficult home conditions. Studies on family achievement guilt have reported that minority students are more likely to be the first in their family to attend college than non-minority students and that they are prone to feelings of guilt over prior generations' inability to pursue further education due to a variety of factors. As a result, these students are more likely to attempt to hide or downplay their scholastic achievements, which can lead to the students becoming depressed. The students living on what they perceive as \\"luxurious campuses\\" have also reported feeling guilt, particularly if their family members continue to experience suffering. Covarrbuias et al. have suggested that depression and family achievement guilt can be lessened by students reflecting on times they helped their family.  Supporting FGCS  The Institute for Higher Education (September 2012), provides an issue brief and describes how to support FGCS through classroom- based practices. First, faculty can be key allies as they are the key point of contact for students in the classroom. When faculty are encouraged by their institutions to uphold strong leadership roles in FGCS initiatives, the results are extremely beneficial. The issue brief has a very helpful graphic that breaks down the strategies faculty can use to help studentsInstitute for Higher Education, P. (2012). \\"Supporting First-Generation College Students Through Classroom-Based Practices.\\" Issue Brief. Institute for Higher Education Policy. Strategies for Faculty to help FGCS Additionally, the Institute for Higher Education (2012) identifies how it is crucial for institutions to examine barriers faced by FGCS and to redesign their curriculum to better serve these students. Some possible approaches involve educators implementing tutoring programs and proving supplemental services to better serve this community. They can create an initiative to train faculty and instructors specially, while keeping in consideration the cultural obstacles these students may face. By identifying and integrating cultural characteristics into the way they serve FGCS, they are being more inclusive and creating stronger relationships between the students and faculty. There are also many educational interventions being put into place to proved more programs and opportunities for FGCS, including AVID, GEAR-UP, and other after school programs. Because many Minority-Serving Institutions (MSI's) don't have a strong grasp on how many FGCS are on their campuses, they may not understand how to serve this community. The Institute for Higher Education (2012) emphasizes the need to use data (also known as evidence-based solutions) to support the efforts to strengthen programs to help FGCS. Some methods include primarily identifying the number of FGCS and the qualitative and quantitative approaches to better serving the population. Schools can also use research models to not only design, but track the most effective practices that provide the utmost opportunities for FGCS. It is also important that teachers and counselors understand how these students define success, and how it may not be measurable or equivalent to an average student whose parents have not attended college before. Although there are programs intact to help FGCS, The Council for Opportunity in Education states that these programs can only serve 11 percent of students. The Institute for Higher Education also points out the obstacles that these programs may not be implemented early enough and may not necessarily be targeted only towards FGCS. If counselors, teachers, and administrators understand the cultural aspect that affects FGCS, they will have the tools necessary to take a holistic approach in proving these students with the specific help they need.

History Lying within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire since the early 12th century, Chorley was originally a township in the ancient parish of Croston until 1793 when it became a civil and ecclesiastical parish in its own right. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Chorley joined with other townships (or civil parishes) in the area to become head of the Chorley Poor Law Union on 26 January 1837 which took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law within that Union area. Although Chorley had been an independent civil parish since 1793, the old-fashioned government by a chief and deputy parish constables, with assistants, continued until 1853, when a Board of Improvement Commissioners was formed. Ten years later, the Commissioners held a meeting on 29 October 1863 and they duly adopted portions of the Public Health Act 1848 and the Local Government Act 1858. In 1881, under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, a charter of incorporation was obtained for the town. The Municipal Borough of Chorley was governed by a mayor and council of eight aldermen and twenty-four councillors, chosen equally from four wards ‚Äî North, East, South and West. The borough's population remained roughly static in the 20th century, with the 1911 census showing 30,315 people and the 1961 census showing 31,315. It was enlarged by gaining from parts of the civil parishes of Duxbury, Euxton and Heath Charnock in 1934. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the municipal borough was abolished on 1 April 1974 and its former area became the core of the larger non-metropolitan Borough of Chorley.

She has previously held academic appointments at the University of Greenwich, the University of Stirling, Lancaster University and Washington University in St. Louis, among others. Palmer is known for her work in environmental and animal ethics. She has published three sole-authored books‚ÄîEnvironmental Ethics (ABC-CLIO, 1997), Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking (Oxford University Press, 1998) and Animal Ethics in Context (Columbia University Press, 2010)‚Äîas well as the co- authored Companion Animal Ethics (Wiley-Blackwell, 2015) and seven sole- or co-edited collections and anthologies. She is a former editor of the religious studies journal Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion, and a former president of the International Society for Environmental Ethics. In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, which was based on her doctoral research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.

Companion Animal Ethics. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell. Thought =Environmental ethics= The process philosopher John B. Cobb (pictured, 2013) challenges Palmer's interpretation of Alfred North Whitehead's philosophy. In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, Palmer examines whether process philosophy, in particular the philosophies of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne, can provide an appropriate background for engaging in environmental ethics. Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than classical theism; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential. Palmer first sets forth a process ethic. The ethic she presents is similar to John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism, but while Mill's approach locates value in pleasure, Palmer's process ethic locates value in \\"richness\\" of experience. She then compares this ethic to several dominant schools in environmental ethics: \\"individualist consequentialism\\" (as championed by Peter Singer, Donald VanDeVeer and Robin Attfield), \\"individualist deontological environmental ethics\\" (including the diverse positions presented by Albert Schweitzer, Kenneth Goodpastor, Tom Regan and Paul W. Taylor), \\"collectivist environmental ethics\\" (including those thinkers who advocate doing what is best for nature as a whole, such as Aldo Leopold and Callicott in his earlier work) and deep ecology. Process ethics, Palmer argues, is closer to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological environmental ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with the extension of the self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne N√¶ss differ in these areas. The book was not intended to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues. There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non- human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics. The book was hailed as an important addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne on a number of points. In addition to writing on process approaches to the environment, Palmer has contributed to Christian environmental ethics more broadly,Palmer, Claire (1994). \\"A Bibliographical Essay on Environmental Ethics\\".

Animal Ethics in Context. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 1‚Äì2. Palmer does not explicitly connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, insofar as it offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the ethics of aiding animals, with a focus on the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context. Palmer begins by defending the claim that animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal. Palmer identifies the laissez-faire intuition (LFI), which is the intuition that humans do not have an obligation to aid wild animals in need. There are three forms of the LFI: #The strong LFI, according to which humans may not harm or assist wild animals. #The weak LFI, according to which humans may not harm wild animals, but may assist them, despite lacking an obligation to do so. #No-contact LFI, according to which humans may not harm wild animals, but may assist them, and may gain obligations to assist them if humans are responsible for the animals' plight. Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact version of the LFI. She defends the distinction between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach is the fact that humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves. Thus, Palmer argues that humans are not normally required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, he says that the difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals. In addition to contextual animal ethics and her exploration of animals in environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities)Palmer, Clare (2011). \\"Animal Disenhancement and the Non-Identity Problem: A Response to Thompson\\".

Born in Berea, Ohio, Schneider completed his undergraduate and graduate education at Columbia, going on to teach at that school for many years. An early student of John Dewey, he studied pragmatism, ontology, social philosophy, and fascism, and is best remembered for his works The Puritan Mind (1930) and A History of American Philosophy (1946). The Herbert Schneider Award, an annual presentation of the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy, is named in his honor. Early life and education Herbert Schneider was born in Berea, Ohio, where his father, Fredrick William Schneider, a German Methodist minister, was a professor at German-Wallace College. The family moved to Brooklyn when Fredrick accepted a call to the Greene Ave. Methodist Church. There, Herbert attended Boy's High School. He attended the City University of New York as an undergraduate before transferring to Columbia University from which he earned a B.A. magna cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. As a graduate student at Columbia, Schneider studied under John Dewey, later serving as Dewey's teaching assistant. His doctoral thesis was titled Science and Social Progress: A Philosophical Introduction to Moral Science. Career =Principal work= Beginning in 1918 Schneider lectured in philosophy and religion at Columbia University, a post he held until his retirement in 1957. He early assisted John Erskine in teaching the very first sessions of his revolutionary Great Books course, and, as a member of the team led by Harry Carman, developed Columbia College's core curriculum Humanities and Contemporary Civilization coursespersonal communication >. For 37 years, beginning in 1924, he was editor of The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods. In 1928 he was installed into the newly created post of Professor of Religion, becoming one of the founding members of Columbia's newly formed religion department. Herbert Schneider's 44-year association with Columbia University began when he enrolled as an undergraduate student in 1913. Schneider's 1930 book The Puritan Mind received acclaim for its treatment of Puritan religious ideas within their social context. However, his 1946 volume A History of American Philosophy, which was translated into several languages and became a formative text on the subject of American philosophy, has become the work for which Schneider is most often remembered. During the early 1940s Schneider supervised the graduate work of the yogi Theos Bernard and, in 1948, was one of five philosophy professors at Columbia who nominated the recently assassinated Mahatma Gandhi for the Nobel Peace Prize. From 1948 to 1949 he served as president of the eastern division of the American Philosophical Association. In 1950 Schneider was a Fulbright Fellow and lectured on American philosophy at the Sorbonne and the Universities of Toulouse, Bordeaux, Aix en Provence, Grenoble, and Marseilles, and, from 1952 to 1957 was an Eranos lecturer in Ascona, Switzerland. He also held visiting professorships at University of Illinois, University of Washington, University of Georgia, University of Hawaii, Oregon State University and Western Washington State College. =Fascism= During the 1920s and 1930s, at the request of Columbia's President, Nicolas Murray Butler, Schneider undertook a study of the emerging Fascist government in Italy. He traveled and studied extensively in Italy in 1928 and again in 1937 for prolonged research sabbaticals. His study of the structure and ideology of Italian society and government was published in his books Making the Fascist State and The Fascist Government of Italy. Schneider's interest in fascism originated in his academic study of pragmatism and his view of democracy as an experimental hypothesis that had yet to prove its efficacy against alternative systems. During his first stay in Italy, Schneider wrote to his mentor, Dewey, observing that: In his public writings, however, he was careful to mask his personal feelings on the subject, causing one reviewer to remark that \\"it is impossible to tell whether his conclusions as to the Fascist mind and the heroic breed are his own judgments or simply expositions of Fascist claims\\". During a 1976 interview, Schneider cautiously rejected suggestions he had been personally sympathetic to Benito Mussolini, explaining his work as academic inquiry only. =UNESCO= In 1954, Schneider took a leave of absence from Columbia to join UNESCO as head of the Division of International Cultural Cooperation. In that post, he completed an extensive survey and report on university education in Asia, among other accomplishments. He returned to Columbia in 1956. =After Columbia= Following his 1957 retirement from Columbia, Schneider briefly taught at Colorado College and the University of Hawaii. He spent 12 years at Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, California where he helped start the doctoral program in philosophy. He also served as Acting Dean for several years. =Blaisdell Institute for World Religions= In 1959, Schneider was appointed Director of the Blaisdell Institute for World Religions at the Claremont Colleges. He facilitated scholarly exchanges with universities in the Far East, and organized a number of international conferences. Personal life With his second wife, Grenafore Westphal, Schneider had three sons, Edward, Frederick, and Robert. He died on October 15, 1984 in Claremont, California. Legacy In 1987 the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy established the Herbert Schneider Award, which is presented annually for lifetime contributions to the advancement of American philosophy. Schneider's papers are held in deposit at Columbia University. His papers after 1938 have been deposited at the University of Illinois-Carbondale.  Selected publications  * Schneider, H.

He then studied for a year at Heriot-Watt College, a technical college that specialised in engineering. Having won a scholarship as a Carnegie Scholar, Melville studied chemistry at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated with a first class honours degree in 1930. He was then awarded a Carnegie Research Scholarship and undertook research toward a doctorate. He competed his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1933 and his doctoral thesis was titled \\"Investigation of molecular structure and chemical change by means of band spectra\\". He was awarded a Doctor of Science (DSc) degree, a higher doctorate, by Edinburgh in 1935. Academic career In 1933, Melville was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He also worked at the Colloid Science Laboratory in Cambridge under Eric Rideal, and in 1938 became its Assistant Director of Research. His research during this period was focused on polymers. In 1939, Melville was appointed a professor as Chair of Chemistry at the University of Aberdeen. However, war broke out before he could take up the post. During World War II, he worked for the British government. From 1940 to 1943, he served as Scientific Adviser to the Chief Superintendent of the Ministry of Supply, and was based at Porton Down. Then, from 1943 to 1945, he served as Superintendent of the Radar Research Station at Malvern, Worcestershire. After the war ended in 1945, Melville returned to the University of Aberdeen. He worked there for the next three years, and his research was focused on gas kinetics and polymer kinetics. In 1948, he moved to the University of Birmingham where he had been appointed Mason Professor of Chemistry. There, he developed a team of doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers who specialised in polymer chemistry. In 1956, Melville moved in administration upon his appointment as Permanent Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. From 1965 to 1967, he served as Chairman of the Science Research Council, the newly created agency that took on oversight of publicly funded scientific research from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In 1967, he was appointed Principal of Queen Mary College. He retired in 1976. Melville was President of the Faraday Society, the leading British society for the study of physical chemistry, from 1958 to 1960. He was President of the Chemical Society from 1966 to 1968. In 1981, Melville became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Later life In retirement, Melville maintained his links with academia and research. He served as Chair of the Council of Westfield College between 1977 and 1983. He was also involved in fighting cuts to university funding. Melville died on 14 June 2000, aged 92. Personal life In 1942, Melville married Janet Marion Cameron; she survives him. They had two daughters. Honours In 1935, Melville was awarded the Meldola Medal by the Institute of Chemistry. In 1955, he was awarded the Davy Medal by the Royal Society \\"in recognition of his distinguished work in physical chemistry and in polymer reactions\\".

Born in Rodna, a village in Transylvania's Bistri»õa-NƒÉsƒÉud County, he came from a poor peasant family, and his parents were Precup »òteopan and his wife Ioana. He was raised by his grandfather, the priest Gherasim Porcu (Latinized as Porcius), whose name he took by adoption. In 1824, he entered the primary school in Rodna, for miners' sons, where he began to pick up the German and Hungarian languages. From 1827 to 1831, he attended the German-language military normal school in NƒÉsƒÉud, followed by the high schools in Blaj and Cluj from 1833 to 1836.Alexandru Nistor, √éndrumƒÉtor √Æn Arhivele Statului Jude»õul Bistri»õa- NƒÉsƒÉud, pp. 416-17.

In 1844, Porcius he a scholarship from the Military Frontier fund allowing him to study at the Vienna pedagogical institute for two years; while there, he audited courses on botany. After returning home, he began teaching in Zagra in 1847 and in NƒÉsƒÉud the following year. After the Transylvanian Revolution of 1848, he occupied various administrative posts, up to that of deputy prefect (vice-captain) of the NƒÉsƒÉud district, until retiring in 1877. A defender of Transylvanian Romanians' rights, he obtained an audience with Emperor Ferdinand I in 1848, causing him to be arrested and deported to Cluj for a year.Ion VƒÉduva-Poenaru, Enciclopedia marilor personalitƒÉ»õi, p. 145. Bucharest: Editura Geneze, 2000. Although Porcius was involved in botany as a passionate amateur, his work was acknowledged by the scientific authorities of the empire. For over sixty years, he explored the Rodna Mountains, methodically studying their flora and discovering several endemic species, of which two bear his name. These are Centaurea carpatica, Lychnis nivalis, Heracleum carpaticum, Pulmonaria dacica, Festuca porcii and Saussurea porcii. He maintained close contact with leading botanists of Central Europe as well as from the Romanian Old Kingdom. He collaborated with Dimitrie Br√¢ndzƒÉ on Flora Dobrogei, and was tasked with specifying the nomenclature and synonyms, as well as compiling cross-references.

His most important publication, from 1868, is Enumeratio plantarum phanerogamicarum districtus quondam Naszondensis; as was customary at the time, it is written in Latin.

There are about thirty speakers, from a persecuted section of the community. Agbirigba is unintelligible to other speakers of Ikwerre, but the rule for its derivation is simple: the consonant t is added before every CV syllable (or, more accurately, every CV mora). Some speakers add an epenthetic vowel to break up the resulting consonant cluster. Derivation The addition of the t results in consonant clusters that do not occur in Ikwerre or other local languages. Some speakers pronounce Agbirigba with the resulting clusters. For speakers to break them up with vowels, the vowels are all high (one of the four vowels ), and match the subsequent vowel in ATR, backness, nasality and tone. An NCV sequence becomes NtCV. For example, mÃÄf√π 'horn' becomes «πtf√π or «πt√πf√π. There are some complications to this: if the following vowel is /a/, with no ATR quality for the epenthetic vowel to match, then the epenthetic vowel will be /i/ or /u/ depending on, apparently, whether the following consonant is coronal or velar, and if the tone of the following syllable (whether CV or CVV) is complex (rising or falling), then the first element of that tone will move to the epenthetic vowel. ;Examples *≈Ñk√©t É√≠ v√≤ r√© √≠d í√≠ \\"Nkechi bought a yam\\" becomes: *≈Ñtk√©tt É√≠ tv√≤ tr√© √≠td í√≠ or *≈Ñt√≠k√©t√≠t É√≠ t√πv√≤ t√≠r√© √≠t√≠d í√≠ Here all the vowels are ATR, so the epenthetic vowels are /i/ or /u/ depending on whether the following vowel is front (/e/ or /i/) or back (/o/ or /u/). There is no t before the word- initial syllabic nasal in Nkechi or word-initial vowel in iji, as neither is a CV syllable. *≈ãÃÅg…îÃÅz…™ÃÅ w·ππ l√™m \\"Ngozi died\\" becomes: *≈Ñtg…îÃÅtz…™ÃÅ tw·ππ tl√™m or *≈Ñt äÃÅg…îÃÅt…™ÃÅz…™ÃÅ t·ππw·ππ t√≠l√®m Here we have some RTR and nasal vowels.

In that context, the mutant rats are obviously the book's villains who must be fought. Finding that the mutant rats developed on a spaceship which crashed on one of the Rim words, and that the mutants survived the crash to multiply, conquer and enslave the humans, Grimes manages to take his ship back in time and blow up the rat-infested ship, thus aborting the entire timeline of mutant rat conquest. Grimes is uneasily aware that his act might be considered as genocide, but sees no other way to avert the enslavement of the humans.

It is located approximately from Earth in the constellation of Centaurus, making it and Proxima c the closest known exoplanets to the Solar System. Proxima Centauri b orbits the star at a distance of roughly with an orbital period of approximately 11.2 Earth days, and has an estimated mass of at least 1.2 times that of the Earth. The planet is subject to stellar wind pressures of more than 2,000 times those experienced by Earth from the solar wind and the habitability of Proxima Centauri b has not yet been definitively established. The discovery of the planet was announced in August 2016. The planet was found using the radial velocity method, where periodic Doppler shifts of spectral lines of the host star suggest an orbiting object. From these readings, the radial velocity of the parent star relative to the Earth is varying with an amplitude of about 1.4 metres (4.5 feet) per second. According to Guillem Anglada‚ÄêEscud√©, its proximity to Earth offers an opportunity for robotic exploration of the planet with the Starshot project or, at least, \\"in the coming centuries\\". Without its orbital inclination known, the exact mass of Proxima Centauri b is unknown. If its orbit is nearly edge-on, it would have a mass of (Earth masses). Statistically, there is a roughly 90% chance that the planet's mass is less than . In May 2019, a paper presenting recent Spitzer Space Telescope data concluded that Proxima Centauri b does not transit its sun relative to Earth, and attributed previous transit detections to correlated noise. Physical characteristics =Mass, radius, and temperature= The apparent inclination of Proxima Centauri b's orbit has not yet been measured. The minimum mass of Proxima b is , which would be the actual mass if its orbit were seen edge on from the Earth. Once its orbital inclination is known, the mass will be calculable. More tilted orientations imply a higher mass, with 90% of possible orientations implying a mass below . The planet's exact radius is unknown. If it has a rocky composition and a density equal to that of the Earth, then its radius is at least . It could be larger if it has a lower density than the Earth, or a mass higher than the minimum mass. Like many super-Earth sized planets, Proxima Centauri b might have an icy composition like Neptune, with a thick enveloping, hydrogen and helium atmosphere; the likelihood that this is the case has been calculated to be greater than 10%. The planet has an equilibrium temperature of , somewhat colder than Earth‚Äôs . If the orbit of Proxima Centauri b is coplanar with that of the candidate exoplanet Proxima Centauri c, for which estimates of the true mass were recently calculated using various combinations of its spectroscopic orbital parameters, Gaia DR2 proper motion anomaly, and astrometric measurements, then a true mass of Proxima b can be estimated. For example, in 2020, a paper published by Kervella et al. estimated Earth masses, and another by Benedict et al. estimated Earth masses, as true mass values for Proxima b. =Host star= The planet orbits an M-type red dwarf named Proxima Centauri. The star has a mass of and a radius of . It has a surface temperature of 3042 K and is 4.85 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. Proxima Centauri rotates once roughly every 83 days, and has a luminosity about . Like the two larger stars in the triple star system, Proxima Centauri is rich in metals compared with the Sun, something not normally found in low-mass stars like Proxima. Its metallicity ([Fe/H]) is 0.21, or 1.62 times the amount found in the Sun's atmosphere.Taken from 100.21, which gives 1.62 times the metallicity of the Sun Even though Proxima Centauri is the closest star to the Sun, it is not visible to the unaided eye from Earth because of its low luminosity (average apparent magnitude of 11.13). Proxima Centauri is a flare star. This means that it undergoes occasional dramatic increases in brightness and high-energy emissions because of magnetic activity that would create large solar storms. On 18 March 2016, a superflare was observed with an energy of 1026.5 joules. The March 2016 flare reached about 68 times usual level, thus a little brighter than the Sun. The surface irradiation was estimated to be 100 times what is required to kill even UV-hardy microorganisms. Based on the rate of observed flares, total ozone depletion of an Earth-like atmosphere would occur within several hundred thousand years. =Orbit= Proxima Centauri b orbits its host star every 11.186 days at a semi-major axis distance of approximately , which means the distance from the exoplanet to its host star is one- twentieth of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Comparatively, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has a semi-major axis distance of 0.39 AU. Proxima Centauri b receives about 65% of the amount of radiative flux from its host star that the Earth receives from the Sun ‚Äì for comparison, Mars receives about 43%. Most of the radiative flux from Proxima Centauri is in the infrared spectrum. In the visible spectrum the exoplanet receives only ~3% of the PAR (400‚Äì700 nm) of Earth irradiance ‚Äì for comparison, Jupiter receives 3.7% and Saturn 1.1%. ‚Äì so it would usually not get much brighter than twilight anywhere on Proxima Centauri b's surface. The maximum illumination of horizontal ground by twilight at sunrise is about 400 lux, while the illumination of Proxima b is about 2700 lux with a quiet Proxima. Proxima also has flares. The brightest flare observed until 2016 had increased the visual brightness of Proxima about 8 times, which would be a large change from the previous level but, at about 17% the illumination of Earth, not very strong sunlight.From knowing the absolute visual magnitude of Proxima Centauri, \\\\scriptstyle M_{V_{\\\\ast}} = 15.6, and the absolute visual magnitude of the Sun, \\\\scriptstyle M_{V_{\\\\odot}} = 4.83, the visual luminosity of Proxima Centauri can be calculated: \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{L_{V_{\\\\ast}}}{L_{V_{\\\\odot}}} = 10^{0.4\\\\left(M_{V_{\\\\odot}} - M_{V_{\\\\ast}}\\\\right)} = 4.92√ó10‚àí5. Proxima Centauri b orbits at 0.0485 AU and so therefore, through use of the inverse- square law, the visual luminosity‚Äîintensity at the planet's distance‚Äîcan be calculated: \\\\scriptstyle 4.92 * 10^{-5} \\\\ * \\\\ \\\\scriptstyle {\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{0.0485} \\\\right)^{2}} \\\\ = \\\\ 0.0209 However, because of its tight orbit, Proxima Centauri b receives about 400 times more X-ray radiation than the Earth does. Habitability Artist's conception of the surface of Proxima Centauri b. The Alpha Centauri binary system can be seen in the background, to the upper right of Proxima. The habitability of Proxima Centauri b has not been established, but the planet is subject to stellar wind pressures of more than 2,000 times those experienced by Earth from the solar wind. This radiation and the stellar winds would likely blow any atmosphere away, leaving the subsurface as the only potentially habitable location on that planet. The exoplanet is orbiting within the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the region where, with the correct planetary conditions and atmospheric properties, liquid water may exist on the surface of the planet. The host star, with about an eighth of the mass of the Sun, has a habitable zone between ‚àº0.0423‚Äì0.0816 AU. In October 2016, researchers at France's CNRS research institute stated that there is a considerable chance of the planet harboring surface oceans and having a thin atmosphere. However, unless the planet transits in front of its star from the perspective of Earth, it is difficult to test these hypotheses. Even though Proxima Centauri b is in the habitable zone, the planet's habitability has been questioned because of several potentially hazardous physical conditions. The exoplanet is close enough to its host star that it might be tidally locked. In this case, it is expected that any habitable areas would be confined to the border region between the two extreme sides, generally referred to as the terminator line, since it is only here that temperatures might be suitable for liquid water to exist. If the planet's orbital eccentricity is 0, this could result in synchronous rotation, with one hot side permanently facing towards the star, while the opposite side is in permanent darkness and freezing cold. However, Proxima Centauri b's orbital eccentricity is not known with certainty, only that it is below 0.35‚Äîpotentially high enough for it to have a significant chance of being captured into a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance similar to that of Mercury, where Proxima b would rotate around its axis approximately every 7.5 Earth days with about 22.4 Earth days elapsing between one sunrise and the next. Resonances as high as 2:1 are also possible. Another problem is that the flares released by Proxima Centauri could have eroded the atmosphere of the exoplanet. However, if Proxima b had a strong magnetic field, the flare activity of its parent star would not be a problem. If water and an atmosphere are present, a far more hospitable environment would result. Assuming an atmospheric N2 pressure of 1 bar and ‚àº0.01 bar of CO2, in a world including oceans with average temperatures similar to those on Earth, a wide equatorial belt (non-synchronous rotation), or the majority of the sunlit side (synchronous rotation), would be permanently ice-free. A large portion of the planet may be habitable if it has an atmosphere thick enough to transfer heat to the side facing away from the star. If it has an atmosphere, simulations suggest that the planet could have lost about as much as the amount of water that Earth has due to the early irradiation in the first 100‚Äì200 million years after the planet's formation. Liquid water may be present only in the sunniest regions of the planet's surface in pools either in an area in the hemisphere of the planet facing the star or‚Äîif the planet is in a 3:2 resonance rotation‚Äîdiurnally in the equatorial belt. All in all, astrophysicists consider the ability of Proxima Centauri b to retain water from its formation as the most crucial point in evaluating the planet's present habitability. The planet may be within reach of telescopes and techniques that could reveal more about its composition and atmosphere, if it has any. If an atmosphere is present, longer-wavelength radiation, from the red dwarf parent star mean that weather will be affected. Cloud formation on the day side of the planet will be inhibited, compared to Earth (or Venus), resulting in clearer skies.  View from Proxima Centauri b  Looking towards the sky around Orion from Alpha Centauri with Sirius near Betelgeuse, Procyon in Gemini, and the Sun between Perseus and Cassiopeia generated by Celestia Viewed from near the Alpha Centauri system, the sky would appear much as it does for an observer on Earth, except that Centaurus would be missing its brightest star. The Sun would be a yellow star of an apparent magnitude of +0.5 in eastern Cassiopeia, at the antipodal point of Alpha Centauri's current right ascension and declination, at (2000). This place is close to the 3.4-magnitude star Œµ Cassiopeiae. Because of the placement of the Sun, an interstellar or alien observer would find the \\\\/\\\\/ of Cassiopeia had become a /\\\\/\\\\/ shapeThe coordinates of the Sun would be diametrically opposite Alpha Centauri AB, at Œ±=, Œ¥= nearly in front of the Heart Nebula in Cassiopeia. Sirius lies less than a degree from Betelgeuse in the otherwise unmodified Orion and with a magnitude of ‚àí1.2 is a little fainter than from Earth but still the brightest star in the Alpha Centauri sky. Procyon is also displaced into the middle of Gemini, outshining Pollux, whereas both Vega and Altair are shifted northwestward relative to Deneb (which barely moves, due to its great distance), giving the Summer Triangle a more equilateral appearance. From Proxima Centauri b, Alpha Centauri AB would appear like two close bright stars with the combined apparent magnitude of ‚àí6.8. Depending on the binary's orbital position, the bright stars would appear noticeably divisible to the naked eye, or occasionally, but briefly, as a single unresolved star. Based on the calculated absolute magnitudes, the apparent magnitudes of Alpha Centauri A and B would be ‚àí6.5 and ‚àí5.2, respectively.Computed; using in solar terms: and , luminosities 1.57 and 0.51 L*/, Sun magnitude ‚àí26.73(v), 11.2 to 35.6 AU orbit. The minimum luminosity adds the planet's orbital radius to the A‚ÄìB distance (max) (conjunction). The maximum luminosity subtracts the planet's orbital radius to the A‚ÄìB distance (min) (opposition).  Formation  It is unlikely that Proxima Centauri b originally formed in its current orbit since disk models for small stars like Proxima Centauri would contain less than one of matter within the central one AU at the time of their formation. This implies that either Proxima Centauri b was formed elsewhere in a manner still to be determined, or the current disc models for stellar formation are in need of revision. Discovery Velocity of Proxima Centauri towards and away from the Earth as measured with the HARPS spectrograph during the first three months of 2016. The red symbols with black error bars represent data points, and the blue curve is a fit of the data. The amplitude and period of the motion were used to estimate the planet's minimum mass. The first indications of the exoplanet were found in 2013 by Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire from archival observation data. To confirm the possible discovery, a team of astronomers launched the Pale Red DotPale Red Dot is a reference to Pale Blue Dot‚Äîa distant photo of Earth taken by Voyager 1. project in January 2016. On 24 August 2016, the team of 31 scientists from all around the world, led by Guillem Anglada-Escud√© of Queen Mary University of London, confirmed the existence of Proxima Centauri b through their research, published in a peer-reviewed article in Nature. The measurements were done using two spectrographs, HARPS on the ESO 3.6 m Telescope at La Silla Observatory and UVES on the 8-metre Very Large Telescope. The peak radial velocity of the host star combined with the orbital period allowed for the minimum mass of the exoplanet to be calculated. The chance of a false positive detection is less than one in ten million. Observational complications of the system still leave theoretical room for additional large planets to orbit Proxima Centauri. Calculations suggest that another super-Earth planet around the star cannot be ruled out and that its presence would not destabilize the orbit of Proxima Centauri b. One such super-Earth was discovered in 2019, known as Proxima c, though it orbits at 1.5 AU away and is thus too far away to noticeably tug on it. Data collected with ESPRESSO excludes the presence of extra companions with masses above 0.6 Me at periods shorter than 50 days. One potential companion, Proxima d, at 0.29 Me, was found to have an orbit around 5.15 days. Future observations The Very Large Telescope and the star system Alpha Centauri. A team of scientists think they can image Proxima Centauri b and probe the planet's atmosphere for signs of oxygen, water vapor, and methane, combining ESPRESSO and SPHERE on the VLT. The James Webb Space Telescope may be able to characterize the atmosphere of Proxima Centauri b, but there is no conclusive evidence for transits combining MOST and HATSouth photometry, giving it less than a 1 percent chance of being a transiting planet. Future telescopes (the Extremely Large Telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope, and the Thirty Meter Telescope) could have the capability to characterize Proxima Centauri b. The discovery of Proxima b was significant to Breakthrough Starshot, a proof of concept project aiming to send a fleet of miniature probes to the Alpha Centauri system. The project is led by research company Breakthrough Initiatives, and plans to develop and launch a fleet of miniature unmanned spacecraft called StarChips, which could travel at up to 20% of the speed of light, arriving at the system in roughly 20 years with notification reaching Earth a little over 4 years later. =2069 Alpha Centauri mission= In 2017, Breakthrough Initiatives and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) entered a collaboration to enable and implement a search for habitable planets in the nearby star system, Alpha Centauri. The agreement involves Breakthrough Initiatives providing funding for an upgrade to the VISIR (VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid-Infrared) instrument on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile.
