She became known as the \\"Tombs Angel\\"Herbert Mitgang, The Man Who Rode the Tiger: The Life and Times of Judge Samuel Seabury, New York: Fordham Univ Press, 1996, p. 36DOUGLAS C. McGILL, \\"Uncovering New York City's Art Collection\\", New York Times, 24 September 1987 because she attended to suspects held before trial at The New York Halls of Justice and House of Detention (otherwise known as \\"The Tombs\\"). She expanded her caring to provide guidance and sometimes small financial support, job seeking assistance, and other aids to newly released prisoners, trying to help them in the transition to the outside world, before the field of probation officer was established in 1901. Biography She was born as Rebecca Salome Elliott on October 24, 1848, in Alabama, the daughter of planter John Howard Elliott and his wife Margaret Adele (n√©e Blue). Her parents likely moved to New York before or during the war, perhaps having been one of those planter families who had close ties with people in the city through business. During the last year of the Civil War, at the age of 19 Rebecca Elliot married Union colonel and attorney John Armstrong Foster (March 5, 1833-February 11, 1890) on February 28, 1865, at Calvary Church in New York. It was designed in 1848 by James Renwick, Jr. at 4th Avenue and 21st Street. She continued to attend this church in the future. One of her daughters later said she remembered family stories that a member of President Abraham Lincoln's cabinet attended her parents' wedding. John Foster was mustered out of the Army in August 1865 and was brevetted as a brigadier general in September 1865. The Fosters had four children together, only two of whom survived to adulthood: Salome (Lomie) Elliott (1865-1867); Marie Louise (1867-), married Francis S. Colt; Jeanette Jennie (1873-1958), married William C. Bowers; and John (Johnnie) Armstrong (1873-1879). Her husband John Armstrong Foster was from Schoharie County, New York. He had moved with his parents to New York City when young. At the age of 28, he had enlisted as a private in the Civil War in April 1861 in Co. ‚ÄúF‚Äù 7th NY Infantry SM, but was mustered out in June. The following year, in November 1862, he was commissioned into Field & Staff 175th NY Infantry, where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. The newly married couple lived in New York City. In later life, John Foster suffered from alcoholism, lost his friends, and abandoned his family in 1888.Obituary: Rebecca Salome Elliott\\", New York Times, February 23, 1902, p. 2 Foster initially supported herself and her daughters from her pay working for the Presbyterian City Mission Society of New York. After John Foster abandoned the family, she wore the black mourning clothes of a widow when in public. Her husband died February 11, 1890, and she became a widow in fact. He was buried at the gravesite of his parents in Woodlawn Cemetery, The Bronx. From the mid-1880s on, Rebecca Foster worked assisting people who were charged and defendants in the New York legal system, especially before they went to trial. She was involved with women defendants. She became known as a \\"Tombs Angel\\" because she ministered to suspects and criminals incarcerated at The New York Halls of Justice and House of Detention (\\"The Tombs\\"). She was one of two women who became notable in this role, the other being Ernestine Schaffner, who also worked on behalf of prisoners from about 1870 until her death in 1903.John Josiah Munro, The New York Tombs, Inside and Out!: Scenes and Reminiscences Coming Down to the Present, 1909, pp. 248-249 Foster eventually worked on her own as a volunteer with prisoners in the \\"Tombs\\". Besides ministering to the needs of the incarcerated pending trial, she had gained considerable respect from government officials. She acted as an unofficial court investigator and advisor, trying to ascertain the facts of each inmate's case and giving her judgment as to whether the person was innocent or guilty of charges.Arthur Henry, \\"Editorial: The Tombs Angel\\", The Outlook, Volume 72, Outlook Company, 1902, pp. 163 - 165 She also worked to support former prisoners in their lives after they were released, taking a role as a kind of ad hoc \\"probation officer\\" well before that formal system was established in New York in 1901. In later life Rebecca Salome Foster lived as a resident at the Park Avenue Hotel. At the age of 54, she was one of at least 14 people who died in the destructive fire there on February 22, 1902. Her funeral at Calvary Church was attended by a large crowd that spanned many classes. She was buried in the same plot as her husband and his parents at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York. One tombstone monument is inscribed with all four of their names and dates. (See photo at Find-a-Grave) Legacy and honors The monument to Foster Foster's role as the somewhat anonymous \\"Tombs Angel\\" was publicized by newspapers after her death. Her funeral on February 25, 1902, at the Calvary Church in Manhattan, was attended by many people whom she had saved from conviction, notable reform figures, and officials and court judges.\\"Death of Mrs Foster the Tombs Angel\\", The Churchman, Volume 85, Churchman Company, 1902, p. 285\\"James Renwick Jr's 1848 Calvary Episcopal Church\\", Daytonian in Manhattan blog, June 2011 After her death, leaders of the City Club initiated a campaign to commission a monument to honor her. Leading judges and President Theodore Roosevelt joined the fundraising effort. The sculptor Karl Bitter was commissioned to create a marble monument to Foster. It is a bas-relief, featuring her and a prisoner. It also had a medallion portrait of her, and a bronze frame by Charles Rollinson Lamb. The work was installed in 1904 at the old Criminal Courts building. It was removed to storage in 1940 when the building was being demolished for replacement. The monument was rediscovered in the 21st century, and restored, although the medallion and bronze frame had been lost ( or stolen) through the decades. It was rededicated on June 25, 2019, when it was installed in the lobby of the New York Supreme Court located at 60 Centre Street in Manhattan. Its restoration and dedication are part of an effort the city is making to recognize women whose contributions have not been formally memorialized.

Language Nunggubuyu also called Wubuy is a non- Pama Nyungan language characterized by head marking with an intricate verb prefix morphology, bound pronominal forms for subject and object and prefixed noun classes. Together with Anindilyagwa it shares the distinction of being one of the most grammatically complicated Australian languages. It has at least 28 loanwords from Makassarese language. Its affiliation with other native Australian languages is disputed. Some speak of a Nunggubuyu‚ÄìNgandi language family, or of it belonging to a larger Gunwingguan language family. The first dictionary of the language was written by the missionary Earl Hughes, who lived among the Nunggubuy for 17 years and spoke the language fluently. Intensive follow-up work, resulting in two major monographs, was undertaken by Jeffrey Heath in the 1970s. Country The Nunggubuyu's traditional lands extended over some southwards from Cape Barrow and Harris Creek to the coastal area opposite Edward Island, and their western boundaries were formed by the Rose and Walker Rivers. History The Nunggubuyu had very important cultural and economic ties with the Warndarang, extinct now as a distinct language group though descendants of several clans of the latter were absorbed by the Nunggubuyu. Social structure As elsewhere in Australia, kinship and descent are dominant concerns of Nunggubuyu society. However they do not share the very frequent system of sections and subsections that determine affinal relations in many Australian tribes, but rather interpersonal genealogical relationships undergird the social structure. This feature, anomalous for the area, is one the Nunggubuyu share with Papuan and Melanasian peoples, such as the Marind-Anim people. The society is structured by a four-fold division covering moieties, phratries, clans and patriarchal lineages. There are two moieties: the Mandayung (with myths that tend to associate it with continuity and dispute resolution) and the Mandaridja, whose myths suggest experimentation and change. They mirror in some respects the dua/yiridja moiety structures of the Yolngu of northeast Arnhem Land. For this reason Mandaridja people absorb into their totemic systems things that are of foreigtn provenance, such as ships, planes and tractors. There are two mytho- ritual complexes divided among these respective moieties. The Mandayung are the proprietors of the Gunabibi (Kunapipi) cult, while the Mandaridja control the \\"Ru:1\\" cult.

His rule was marred by the long-standing struggle between the Imeretian crown seeking to subdue Mingrelia and Mingrelian efforts to win full independence, a continuation of the conflict which had plagued western Georgia for centuries. Grigol's rapprochement with the expanding Russian Empire resulted in Mingrelia becoming, in 1804, a Russian subject with a degree of internal autonomy under the Dadiani dynasty, an arrangement which remained in place until 1856.  Early rule  Grigol was the eldest son of Katsia II Dadiani by his third wife Anna Tsulukidze. In 1788, Grigol, then 18-year-old, succeeded on the death of his father as prince-regnant of Mingrelia. King David II of Imereti made use of his youth to advance his claims to Mingrelia and, notwithstanding important services rendered by Katsia II Dadiani, invaded the principality. Grigol took to Lechkhumi, a highland district disputed between Imereti and Mingrelia, whose loyalty then lay with Dadiani. King Heraclius II of Kartli‚ÄìKakheti intervened militarily and helped defeat David at Matkhoji in July 1789, thereby restoring Grigol to Mingrelia and securing the crown of Imereti for his grandson, Solomon II. This was followed by the 1790 treaty, which established a loose confederation of Georgian kings and princes. Grigol then married Heraclius's granddaughter Princess Nino, while Grigol's sister Mariam became Solomon II's wife.  Conflict with Imereti  The unresolved dispute over Lechkhumi, however, quickly led to a renewed conflict between Imereti and Mingrelia. In 1791, Solomon II of Imereti succeeded in ousting Grigol in favor of his own younger brother, Manuchar. Grigol fled to the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe. King Heraclius II's mediation failed and Grigol was detained on his arrival for negotiations in Kutaisi, Imereti's capital. He soon managed to escape with the help of his uncle, Giorgi Dadiani, and Kaikhosro Gelovani, governor-general of Lechkhumi, and entrenched himself in the fortress of Nogi in Mingrelia, which Solomon failed to take and fell back to Kutaisi. As a result, the king had to recognize Grigol as prince of Mingrelia, who, in his turn, conceded the fiefdom of Salipartiano to his estranged brother Manuchar, Solomon's prot√©g√©. Grigol, however, found his authority limited by rising influence of Kaikhosro Gelovani, whom he had murdered in 1799. Peace with Imereti did not endure. In 1802, Solomon invaded Lechkhumi, defeated Dadiani at Salkhino, and had him replaced by another brother, Tariel. Grigol quickly regained his position, but he had to concede the fort of Anaklia and to surrender his own son and heir, Levan, as an honorary hostage to Kelesh Bey, ruler of Abkhazia, in exchange of received support.  Mingrelia joins Russia  By that time, a momentous event had taken place in Georgia; in 1801, the Russian Empire annexed the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti. In October 1802, Grigol Dadiani approached the Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Tsitsianov, expressing his desire to put himself under Russian protection, provided his and his descendants' rights as rulers of Mingrelia were guaranteed. The Russian diplomats, having secured Ottoman neutrality on the Mingrelian issue, formalized the agreement with Dadiani with the Treaty of Dadichala on 1 December 1803, which was ratified by Tsar Alexander I on 20 March 1804. Dadiani was recognized as Prince of Mingrelia, the legal ruler of \\"Odishi, Lechkhumi, Svaneti, and Abkhazia\\", in exchange of Dadiani‚Äôs acceptance of the Tsar's suzerainty. The treaty, which would remain in force until 1856, made Mingrelia an autonomous principality within the Russian Empire and a cornerstone of Russian imperial power-building in western Caucasus. On the occasion of the conclusion of the treaty, Grigol was awarded the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky, which was returned by the Russian authorities to the Imperial Administration of Orders after the prince's death, ignoring Princess Nino's request to leave it in the Dadiani family. In 1804, Solomon II followed Dadiani's suit, accepting the Russian suzerainty at gunpoint. Both rulers were reassured by the Russians regarding the ownership of Lechkhumi, but the disputed district remained under Dadiani's control. Grigol then tried to exploit Russia's increasingly tense relations with Imereti and went so far as to petition the Tsar to depose Solomon II as king and to replace him with his cousin, Prince Ioann of Georgia. The Russian government, still hoping to bend Solomon into submission, immediately disavowed the plan.  Death and aftermath  As the renewed crisis over Lechkhumi was unfolding, Grigol Dadiani died, unexpectedly, at Muri in October 1804. He was buried at the Martvili Monastery. Dadiani's widow, Princess Nino, who assumed regency for Grigol's heir, Levan, immediately accused the rival nobles of having poisoned the prince and requested from the Russian commander in Georgia, Prince Pavel Tsitsianov, to have an inquiry into her husband's murder. On the other hand, Nino's opponents spread rumors that the princess herself was behind the murder of Prince Grigol, who had been briefly involved with a woman of the Chichua family. Tsitsianov himself exploited the suspicion of homicide to remove Grigol's treating doctor, the Italian Capuchin missionary Nicola di Rutigliano, who was suspected of anti-Russian intrigues.  Family  Grigol Dadiani and his wife, Nino, daughter of George XII of Georgia, had two sons and seven daughters: * Princess Ketevan (born 1792), who married first Manuchar Shervashidze, Prince of Samurzakano (died 1813), and then, in 1823, Rostom-Bey, son of Kelesh Ahmed-Bey Shervashidze, Prince of Abkhazia. A grandson of her first marriage was Prince Giorgi Shervashidze (1847‚Äì1918), Governor of Tiflis, known for his persecution of the doukhobors in 1895. * Prince Levan (1793‚Äì1846), Sovereign Prince of Mingrelia (1804‚Äì1840). * Princess Mariam (born 1794), who was married firstly to Prince Giorgi Eristavi of Guria and secondly, c. 1810, to Prince Rostom (Tato), son of Beri Gelovani, Lord of Lechkhumi. * Princess Elene (born 1795), who was married firstly to Prince David Gurieli (died 1833), son of Giorgi V Gurieli, and secondly to Prince Giorgi Mikeladze. * Princess Ekaterine (born 1797), who married in 1810 Colonel Prince Beglar (Petre) Jambakur-Orbeliani (1776‚Äì1819), son of Prince Zaal Orbeliani. * Prince Giorgi (1798‚Äìc. 1851), Major-General of the Russian army.

The novel is viewed as a reflection of the authors memories in Saskatchewan during the pioneer days in the steam engine era. The story focuses on the excitement that the steam engine train and new settlers brought to the townsfolk of the city of Moose Jaw, and the way people lived during this changing time. The novel is described to have no constant story line as it jumps from one year to another and then back, it also changes the setting as the story takes the readers on trips to other provinces, such as Alberta and Manitoba. Unbind the Sheaves: A Prairie Memoir is thought to describe a world which the people (people from the 1960s ) find relevant and yet as if it's from a different era.

It is estimated that GA affects >5 million people worldwide and approximately 1 million patients in the US, which is similar to the prevalence of neovascular (wet) AMD, the other advanced form of the disease. The incidence of advanced AMD, both geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD, increases exponentially with age and while there are therapies for wet AMD, GA currently has no approved treatment options. The aim of most current clinical trials is to reduce the progression of GA lesion enlargement. Presentation Geographic atrophy is a chronic disease, which leads to visual function loss. This often results in difficulties performing daily tasks such as reading, recognizing faces, and driving, and ultimately has severe consequences on independence. Initially, patients often have good visual acuity if the GA lesions are not involved in the central macular, or foveal, region of the retina. As such, a standard vision test may underrepresent the visual deficit experienced by patients who report challenges reading, driving or seeing in low light conditions. While fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography are today well established for diagnosing and tracking progression in geographic atrophy more complex diagnostic assessments may be required in the context of clinical trials. Pathogenesis The pathogenesis of GA is not fully understood yet. It is likely multifactorial and triggered by intrinsic and extrinsic stressors of the poorly regenerative retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), particularly oxidative stress caused by the high metabolic demand of photoreceptors, photo- oxidation, and environmental stressors such as cigarette smoke. Variations in several genes, particularly in the complement system, increase the risk of developing GA. This is an active area of research but the current hypothesis is that with aging, damage caused by these stressors accumulates, which coupled with a genetic predisposition, results in the appearance of drusen and lipofuscin deposits (early and intermediate AMD). These and other products of oxidative stress can trigger inflammation via multiple pathways, particularly the complement cascade, ultimately leading to loss of photoreceptors, RPE, and choriocapillaris, culminating in atrophic lesions that grow over time. Recent studies indicate that geographic atrophy may be due to deficiencies in blood flow within the choriocapillaris. These studies used swept source optical coherence tomography angiography to examine the choriocapillaris. Using imaging algorithms, they then determined which regions of the choriocapillaris had deficient blood flow, thus creating a \\"heat-map\\" of the blood supply to the retinal pigment epithelium. They went on to use fundus autoflorescence to image the retinal pigment epithelium over the course of a year, this allowed them to map out the direction and magnitude with the geographic atrophy spread. They then found that regions of the choricapillaris which had less blood flow were more likely to degenerate and become geographic atrophy. Since the choriocapillaris is the main blood supply of the retinal pigment epithelium, it is leading some to believe that geographic atrophy is primarily an ischemic disease (disease due to decreased blood flow). Diagnosis Diagnosis of geographic atrophy is made by an ophthalmologist in clinic. Fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography angiography are imaging modalities that can be used in the diagnosis. While fundus autoflorescene is the standard modality for viewing geographic atrophy, optical coherence tomography can offer unique benefits. Optical coherence tomography angiography can help the physician see if there is any subretinal fluid in the eye. This is useful because it could indicate that the patient may be developing wet AMD. Since patients with geographic atrophy are at higher risk for developing advanced wet AMD (neovascular AMD), this could be especially useful in the monitoring of patients with geography atrophy. If signs of neovascular AMD found, the physician can initiate treatment of wet age related macular degeneration. Treatment There are currently no approved treatments to reverse or halt the progression of geographic atrophy. There are multiple types of advanced AMD: 1) neovascular AMD and 2) geographic atrophy. Although there are treatments for neovascular AMD, there are none for geographic atrophy. While there are no approved treatments for geographic atrophy, it is important they are still regularly followed by an ophthalmologist so that if patients develop neovascular AMD, they can be treated.

Built by General Electric, it first entered service in 1958, replacing the earlier and much simpler AN/MPQ-10. The MPQ-4 could determine the location of an enemy mortar in as little as 20 seconds by observing a single round, whereas the MPQ-10 required several rounds to be launched and could take 4 to 5 minutes to take a \\"fix\\". The MPQ-4 remained one of the primary US counter- battery systems through the late 1970s until it was replaced by passive electronically scanned array radars like the AN/TPQ-36. History During World War II, operators or the newly introduced SCR-584 radar noticed they sometimes could see artillery shells in flight. With considerable effort, they could follow these rounds and then manually estimate the radial trajectory. By looking along that path, they could see the rounds being launched and then forward that information to friendly artillery units. The US Army's first counter-battery radar was the AN/MPQ-10. This was essentially a smaller version of the SCR-584 mounted on a Bofors 40 mm gun carriage. Introduced in 1951, the system remained manually operated, although with a few modifications to make the operation somewhat similar. Tracking down an enemy mortar generally took on the order of 4 to 5 minutes, and required a number of rounds to be fired. The AN/KPQ-1 attempted to improve on this by using five radar antennas aimed at slightly different angles horizontally, spreading the beam out so it covered a larger area of the horizon. A better solution to the problem of seeing the first round had been developed by John Stuart Foster while working at the MIT Radiation Laboratory as part of a technical exchange from the Canadian National Research Council. The Foster scanner was a mechanical system that rapidly scanned moved a radar signal back and forth along a selected axis. For the counter-battery role, the beam was scanned horizontally, so any round launched across a wide angle in front of the radar would be seen as it passed through the fan-shaped beam. The AN/MPQ-4 was the first operational counter-battery radar to use the Foster scanner. It entered service in 1958, sending the MPQ-10 to secondary roles, mostly for tracking outgoing rounds from friendly artillery for adjusting fire. The MPQ-4 was widely used in the Vietnam War, where it was often emplaced on short wooden platforms to provide an improved view of the horizon. Digital electronics and passive scanning of the signal made the MPQ-4 obsolete. Two replacements were developed, the AN/TPQ-36 and the larger AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder systems, with the TPQ-36 undergoing extensive qualification testing between 1975 and 1979 and entering deployed service in 1982. Description The primary signal in the MPQ-4 was supplied by a Ku band cavity magnetron. The signal was sent into a Foster scanner that produced an output 17.8 mils wide and 14.25 mils high (1 by 0.8 degrees) and scanned it back and forth horizontally 17 times a second. The resulting pattern was a fan shape, narrow vertically and 445 mils (~25 degrees) wide horizontally. A splitter, the \\"beam separation plate\\", split the original input beam into two slightly separated signals. The result was two stacked fans positioned 36 mils (~2 degrees) apart vertically. When a round was fired it would penetrate the two beams in turn. Returns from both were sent to the same B-scope display, causing two blips to appear. When the first appeared, the operator would turn two hand wheels to move a horizontal and vertical lines on the display, the strobes, so they lay on top of the blip. They then waited for the round to appear in the upper beam, causing another blip to appear. This time they used a second set of wheels to move the strobes to the new location. The entire process takes as little as 20 seconds. The handwheels were connected to an analog computer that continually output the calculated coordinates of the launcher. The calculation was quite simple, using a straight line interpolation between the two points to determine the location. This was expressed as range and azimuth, and by entering the location of the radar prior to measurement, the relative position (easting and northing) in meters. If the values were unlikely to be accurate, a red lamp lit on the panel. To help accurately position the strobes, a range-gate system could be used to magnify the display. This had the effect of moving the blips apart vertically, making the difference between them more pronounced. The system was also generally more accurate if it was pointed at a low angle, so the difference between the actual parabolic path and the straight line extrapolated by the computer was minimized. Accuracy could be further improved by turning another wheel to indicate the time between the appearance of the two blips. A stopwatch-like timer was positioned to the right of the main display to make this easy. However, the main purpose of this timer was to allow the system to calculate the vertical velocity of the round, and from that, the expected peak of the trajectory, which was then used to calculate the impact point. The system could also be used with some capability against artillery that fired at a lower angle, like a howitzer. Since a shell from such a weapon might never climb high enough to cross both beams, the system had a second mode that used a single wider beam instead. In this \\"single beam\\" mode the shell would appear on the display and then disappear again after some time, resulting in a long streak instead of a small blip. The calculation was carried out as normal by positioning the strobes at either end of the streak. The system had a maximum range of and could be used effectively at that range. Accuracy was about in range and 1.5 mils in azimuth, but the resolution of the display limited that to about . The system was packed onto a 1¬Ω ton trailer, with the radar scanner roughly centered and the operator's console on a mount at the back. The system could be operated directly from the back of the trailer, or the console could be removed and connected back to the radar using a cable. Power was supplied by a 400 Hz generator. Total weight was about . Setup time was typically 15 to 30 minutes.

A Day Without a Woman was a strike action held on March 8, 2017, on International Women's Day. The strike, which was organized by two different groups‚Äîthe 2017 Women's March and a separate International Women's Strike movement‚Äîasked that women not work that day to protest the policies of the administration of Donald Trump. Planning began before Trump's November 2016 election. The movement was adopted and promoted by the Women's March, and recommended actions inspired by the \\"Bodega Strike\\" and the Day Without Immigrants. Organizers in the U.S. encouraged women to refrain from working, spending money (or, alternatively, electing to shop only at \\"small, women- and minority-owned businesses\\"), and to wear red as a sign of solidarity. Platform The strike was organized by international coalitions of activists with a range of articulated demands. =Platforms of US-based organizers= The American strike platform demanded \\"open borders,\\" freedom from \\"immigration raids,\\" and \\"the decolonization of Palestine\\" as ancillary goals to \\"emancipation of women.\\" The group of 8 well-known activists who issued the first call for a March 8, 2017 strike in the United States described it as \\"anti-capitalist,\\" \\"anti-racist, anti-imperialist, anti-heterosexist,\\" \\"anti-neoliberal,\\" and opposed to \\"the violence of the market, of debt, of capitalist property relations, and of the state; the violence of discriminatory policies against lesbian, trans and queer women; the violence of state criminalization of migratory movements.\\"  Planning  =International= The strike was worldwide, planning began in Poland in October 2016, before the election of Trump. =United States= On February 6, eight political activists including Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff, Cinzia Arruzza, Tithi Bhattacharya, Nancy Fraser, Barbara Ransby, Rasmea Odeh, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, and Angela Davis called for a March 8 strike in the United States. Later that morning, organizers of the 2017 Women's March against the Trump administration endorsed the idea of a general strike without specifying a date. On February 14 organizers of the January Women's March endorsed the March 8 strike, raising questions about what group was in charge and what the goals and scope of the protest would be. Other groups had called for general strikes as well. Journalists noted how women's marches and multi-issue general strikes had effected changes outside the United States. Most notably, the International Women's Strike encouraged women around the world to go on strike on the same day as the Women's March strike. The Women's March organizers, which included political activists Angela Davis and Linda Sarsour, encouraged all participating women, regardless of whether they were striking, to take similar actions as those taken during the \\"Bodega Strike\\" and the Day Without Immigrants‚Äînot shopping, except at small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities; and wearing red in solidarity, since red has traditionally been the color of labor movements around the world. The organizers also asked participants to not work on that day, either in paid or unpaid labor. Men participating in the strike could show support by performing that day's housework and childcare duties. A week after the original announcement, the event's organizers announced the strike's date as March 8, 2017, which was when that year's International Women's Day occurred. Uber let its employees know that they were free to take the day off to participate in the protest. Microsoft, MTV News, Teen Vogue, Bustle, Jezebel, Fusion, the Cut, The A.V. Club, and Twitter also allowed women employees to take the day off. Strike actions An International Women's Day strike took place in over 50 different countries and in 400 cities across the world. There were tens of thousands of women in Poland demonstrating for women's rights. =In the United States= Demonstrators in front of San Francisco City Hall. Baltimore rally participants. There were around 1,000 demonstrators outside of Trump Tower in New York City. Four of the primary organizers of the march‚ÄîTamika Mallory, Linda Sarsour, Carmen Perez, and Bob Bland‚Äîwere arrested for obstruction of traffic outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower on New York City's Columbus Circle. Los Angeles held a large demonstration at Grand Park. In San Francisco, a rally at City Hall drew over a thousand people. In Washington, D.C., House Democratic representatives walked out of the Capitol in an action of solidarity with the protester. An event called \\"Women Workers Rising\\" happened in front of the U.S. Department of Labor. Late night entertainment shows in the United States, such as Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and the Late Late Show with James Corden, all had skits and guests celebrating the strike. Impact Some school districts in the United States were shut down because of the number of teachers that requested the day off. Schools in Alexandria, Virginia, and in Prince George's County Public Schools in Maryland were closed. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools in North Carolina, and Center City Public Charter Schools in Washington, D.C., were also closed. The municipal court in Providence, Rhode Island, was closed because of the number of women who participated in the strike.  Criticism  Some criticism of the strike was aimed at the sense of white privilege critics felt was present. These critics felt that the idea was a good one, but felt that only women in good economic situations, mostly consisting of white women, would be able to take part, as women of color (who disproportionately make up minimum-wage jobs) would not have the freedom to take time off work without the fear of losing their jobs. In response to this criticism, strike organizers pointed out that other strikers in different eras were not considered \\"privileged\\". Sarsour said, \\"We honor the women who striked in the Montgomery bus boycott...Are those privileged women? What about the farmworkers that said 'we will not pick this produce without worker's protections?' Were those people privileged?\\" See also * Fearless Girl, temporary sculpture installed in New York City on March 8, 2017 * Great American Boycott * Ni una menos * NiUnaMenos (Peru) References External links * 2017 in American politics 2017 in women's history 2017 protests Feminist protests General strikes March 2017 events Protest marches in the United States Protests against Donald Trump Women's marches ","title":"Day Without a Woman"},{"id":"53361882","text":"Hamonic is a surname.

It is located in the southern part of the walled city, at the corner of calle San Bartolom√© and calle Cristo de la Para, a few hundred meters south-west of the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a. History It was incorporated in 1877 as a convent church to the monastery of Jer√≥nimas de la Reina , when this community occupied the immediate building, by donation of the Empress Eug√©nie de Montijo. After further restoration work was undertaken in 1957, it then served as a priestly house and is currently a Major Seminary. In spite of the successive adaptations necessary for the present uses, the structure of the old Renaissance palace was maintained, though clear indications of profound modernization was done in the 19th century, organized with dependencies around an irregular courtyard. The palace and the church were initially separated by an alley until 1877 when they were connected by the wall that can be seen today along the descent of San Bartolom√©. In 1998 the church was declared a Monument of Cultural Interest by the Spanish government. Description This Mud√©jar style church underwent several reconstructions are perceived that have modified the primitive base. The oldest part of the church date back to 1145; But the central apse, following a model very close to the churches of Cristo de la Vega or San Vicente, does not seem any earlier than the 13th century. From the end of the 15th century works modify the primitive structure. In the section of the presbytery, taking advantage of the thickness of the walls, are accommodated two small funerary chapels. It was renovated in the 19th century to serve like convent of nuns. =Tower= The oldest part of the church is the tower, now incorporated in the nave of the Gospel, but originally external. Its medieval condition was exposed during a restoration campaign in 1940. It is modeled directly from a Muslim minaret, as in the church of Santiago del Arrabal with which it has obvious similarities: * the inner structure -lanta with tenon central bulk and use of slabs staggered brick saledizo * on the outside -coupled masonry fence, in very narrow boxes * above all the presence of a window, with double horseshoe arch and alfiz, identical to that of Santiago del Arrabal. As in Santiago del Arrabal, on whose walls appear some reused Visigoth reliefs, although fewer than in the tower of the church of San Salvador. It could be dated to the first half of the thirteenth century; although, some authors confer greater seniority. =Elevation= In the church several reconstructions are perceived that have modified the primitive plant. The oldest appointment of the same one is of 1145; but the central apse, which follows a model very close to that of Cristo de la Vega or San Vicente, does not seem to be before the end of the thirteenth century. Like those other temples, its structure would correspond to a church with only one nave; which can be verified in view of the thickness of the old exterior walls of the apse, incorporated in the current presbytery, and used at the end of the XV century, to open small chapels. The expansion, from one to three naves, posed a problem of integration, in the head: incorporate the ships to the apse, already built, a problem that was solved by means of two square spaces, whose exterior walls repeat the organization of the arcade game of the central apse, where the first floor is made up of arches of half a point, the second of arches califales with polilobulado trasd√≥s and the third and superior of arches califales with arches of horseshoe arch. The proximity of the date of construction, between this and those, would justify the extraordinary similarity in the technique and typology of the arches, which makes them appear to constitute the same work.

As a saxophonist, he worked with Claude Abadie and Boris Vian and cofounded the Be Bop Minstrels with his brother in 1947. In 1949-1950 he toured Europe and recorded with Coleman Hawkins, then worked with Kenny Clarke and Django Reinhardt before embarking on another European tour with Dizzy Gillespie and Rex Stewart.

Officially, elections for mayor of West Palm Beach are nonpartisan. Prior to this election, the city operated under a council‚Äìmanager government system since 1919, with the city commissioners choosing the mayor, a mostly ceremonial office that had less power than the city manager. However, in March 1991, voters approved a referendum to allow a strong mayor and to transition the city government to a mayor-council structure. Thus, it was the first direct election for mayor of West Palm Beach since 1919. Candidates for the general election included attorney and former state representative Joel T. Daves, senior city planner Jim Exline, former city commissioner Nancy M. Graham, Josephine Stenson Grund, property management company owner and former mayor Michael D. Hyman, and former Palm Beach County commissioner Bill Medlen. With no candidate obtaining a majority of the vote, Graham and Hyman, who received 33.4% and 24.9% of the vote, respectively, advanced to a run-off election held on November 19. Graham prevailed over Hyman by a margin of 55.8%-44.2% and became the first strong and popularly elected mayor in over seven decades. Background In the early history of West Palm Beach, mayors were elected by a direct vote, beginning with John S. Earman in 1894. However, a movement to transition to a council‚Äìmanager government gained enough momentum to allow a vote in 1919. Under the proposal, the citizens would elect members of the city council, who would in turn select the mayor. On August 29, 1919, voters approved the proposal by 201-82. The proposal also called for a primary for the election of city commissioners to be held within three weeks. The rules for the primary stated the top three vote-getters were elected to the city council. Eventually, the city commission expanded to five members. In 1978, candidates for commission began being elected by district, rather than at-large. =Strong mayor referendum= During the next several decades following the vote in 1919, public opinion reversed in support of a strong mayor, elected by citizens. In a straw poll conducted by The Palm Beach Post in 1990, 78.5% of respondents indicated that they wanted to directly elect the mayor. Later that year, a five-member committee began collecting signatures for a petition to force a vote. The group collected 1,638 signatures, one more than required. Under their proposal, the mayor would be elected to a four-year term and be eligible for re-election once, the city manager and mayor would share administrative duties, and the mayor would receive the power to veto commission votes, which could be overridden by a 4-1 vote. Additionally, the mayor would be authorized to line-item veto the budget, initiate investigations, and supervise contracts and purchases involving more than $5,000. This proposal was listed on the ballot as Question 2. In response, the city commission submitted Question 1, which effective added a weak mayor. In this proposal, the difference versus Question 2 is that the city manager would retain administrative authority, the mayor would vote with city commissioners in the event of a tie, and the mayor could not veto votes by the city commission. On the ballot, voters were required to vote yes or no to Question 1 and Question 2. If both received a majority of yes votes, the question with more votes passed. The election was held on March 12, 1991. Both propositions received a majority of the votes. Question 1 received 2,944 yes votes versus 2,665 no votes, a margin of 52.6%-47.4%. Question 2 passed by a margin of 65.7%-34.3% and a vote total of 3,779-1,972. Therefore, Question 2 prevailed, allowing citizens of West Palm Beach to directly elect a strong mayor.

As a county asylum, it was replaced by Tone Vale Hospital in 1897, but it continued to house long-stay elderly and mentally infirm patients. It finally closed in 1991, when the buildings were converted into houses and apartments. History The hospital was established as a county asylum for pauper lunatics, under the County Asylums Act 1808, following campaigns by Sir Edwin Chadwick and the work of the Poor Law Commission and opened in 1848. The buildings were designed by George Gilbert Scott and William Bonython Moffatt. It was built at a cost of ¬£38,000 by Kirk of Sleaford. The first patients were brought to the hospital from local workhouses. Some of the male patients tended the hospital's own farm which provided food for the institution. During the 1850s, within a few years of opening, the hospital was nearing its capacity of 350 and new dining and recreation halls were built. In 1867 the attics were made into dormitories. In the 1870s land adjacent to the hospital was bought to establish a cemetery which was used for the patients who died until 1963 during which time 2,900 burials were carried out. A further villa capable of holding 100 patients was added in 1882. In the 1920s electricity was installed which was followed by a cinema in the 1930s. The function as an asylum was taken over by Tone Vale Hospital in 1897, after which Mendip Hospital provided services for long-stay elderly and mentally infirm patients. It closed in 1991 and the building was converted into houses and flats. Architecture The main two-storey building, with attics, has a frontage in an \\"E\\" shape which is long. The roofs are covered in slate and have ogee- shaped gables and finials, with stone chimney stacks. The stone chapel, which is joined to the main building by a covered walkway, is supported by two-stage buttresses and has a spire on the crossing tower. There is also a lodge at the entrance to the site.

Originally the previous Yugoslav state was one of the original 51 member states of the United Nations. Background The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was established on 28 April 1992 by the remaining Yugoslav republics of Montenegro and Serbia, claimed itself as the legal successor state of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; however, on 30 May 1992, United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 was adopted, by which it imposed international sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its role in the Yugoslav Wars, and noted that \\"the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted,\\" and on 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, by which it considered that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations,\\" and therefore decided that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly\\". The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to comply with the resolution for many years, but following the ousting of President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá from office, it applied for membership, and was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000. On 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had its official name changed to Serbia and Montenegro, following the adoption and promulgation of the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro by the Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On the basis of a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2006. In a letter dated on the same day, the President of Serbia informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the UN was being continued by Serbia, following Montenegro's declaration of independence, in accordance with the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro was admitted to the UN on 28 June 2006. Since 1999, Kosovo had been administered by the UN after the end of the Kosovo war; however, on 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared independence from Serbia as the Republic of Kosovo. While the United States, the United Kingdom and France have recognized this act, Serbia and some of the international community‚Äîmost notably Russia, China, Algeria, Cuba, Egypt, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Spain, India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Iran, Jamaica, Greece and Mexico‚Äîhave not recognised Kosovo's declaration of independence. As of 2020, Kosovo has yet to become a member-state or observer-state of the United Nations.

Biography = Youth = Carla Capponi grew up in Rome, where she was the eldest child. She attended the Ennio Quirino Visconti Liceo Ginnasio in the same class of Carlo Lizzani and Piero Della Seta, the future Communist city councillor Piero Della Seta. In 1940 her father who was a mining engineer died and the three sisters had to work, forcing Carla Capponi also to abandon her studies of Law. On 19 July 1943, immediately after the bombing of San Lorenzo, Carla rushed to the Policlinico Hospital in search of her mother and remained there as a volunteer; subsequently she allows clandestinely communist activists to gather in her apartment in front of the Trajan's Forum, including Gioacchino Gesmundo, Luciano Lusana, Adele Bei, Carla Angelini and Mario Leporatti. In one of these meetings she met Rosario Bentivegna, three years younger medical student; while in via Margutta instead, in the studio of the sculptor Nino Franchina, she met the activist Filiberto Sbardella (one of the leaders of the Red Flag). =Italian resistance= Around the time of the German occupation of Italy, she joined the Italian Communist Party and began her involvement in the resistance. A comrade in the struggle described her as \\"this young blonde woman who went out at night to shoot Germans... [W]ith arms in hand, first among the first, she participated in dozens of actions, distinguishing herself in a superb way.\\" During the war she was known as \\"The little English Girl\\" (Inglesina). Among her first major actions was the assassination of a German officer leaving the Hotel Excelsior carrying a briefcase with defence plans for the city. Capponi described the action: > \\"It was a traumatic experience. I almost wanted to call to him, to make him > turn around... but I knew he was armed. It seemed impossible that with my > peaceful disposition, against any form of violence, I should hold the gun, > point it at him and shoot him in the back. I took his briefcase. I was in > shock...

After getting over the > initial shock, especially since many of our comrades were being arrested and > tortured, all our scruples were replaced by sheer determination to fight for > our cause.\\" She quickly rose to become a vice-commander of a Gruppi di azione patriottica (GAP; \\"Patriotic Action Groups\\") squad. =Post-war= On 22 September 1944 Capponi married Rosario Bentivegna, with whom she fought in the resistance. In 1945, she gave birth to a daughter named Elena. The couple later divorced in 1974. In 1953 she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Italian Communist Party. She served two terms, from 1953 to 1958 and later from 1972 to 1976. A few months before his death he published the memoirs \\"Con cuore di donna\\". She also served on the executive committee of the National Association of Italian Partisans until her death in 2000. The body was cremated and initially buried at the Verano cemetery. In 2014, her daughter Elena (who died the following year, in 2015, at 69 years of age), not having obtained the opportunity to bury her parents together, in 80 centimeters of earth in the non-Catholic cemetery of Rome at Testaccio, as desired by themselves, he respected their will, as a second hypothesis, to have scattered their ashes in the Tiber river.

The film was Kara's thesis at VGIK. Synopsis The film is set in 1940. Life in class 9b begins as usual. Children on the threshold of adult life get to know themselves, learn to love and understand each other. The story is centered around Iskra Polyakova ‚Äì class prefect, daughter of principled party worker comrade Polyakova. Iskra is a self-assured Komsomolka who was brought up by a fanatically devoted to the party mother. Her ideals are inviolable and the concepts seem clear-cut and correct to her. Gathered at the birthday party of one of her classmates, Iskra listens to the verses of Sergei Yesenin which are read by her friend Vika, daughter of the town's famous aircraft designer Leonid Lyuberetsky. Iskra likes Yesenin's poetry, but she considers him an alien to Soviet culture \\"tavern singer.\\" This was how she was taught. Vika gives her classmate the book and explains to Iskra, that Yesenin was not a 'decadent' poet and that feelings are an integral part of life. Several days pass. Iskra meets the father of Vika, begins a deeper understanding of some things, asks her mother and herself questions, tries to understand the concepts of justice, duty and happiness. The school's existence takes its natural course: the children study, fall in love with each other. Even Iskra accepts courting of former classmate Sasha Stameskin whom Lyuberetsky hired at his factory. But everything changes suddenly. One evening, the teens learn that designer Lyuberetskiy was arrested on suspicion of subversive activities against the Soviet Union. Iskra decides to support her girlfriend, despite her mother's warning of impending repression. The school head teacher Valentina Andronovna calls Lyuberetskaya into the office and says that tomorrow at the school line she should publicly renounce her father and call him an \\"enemy of the people.\\" Vika refuses. After that, \\"Valendra\\" invites Polyakova to office and asks her to convene a meeting, having expelled Luberetskaya from the Komsomol with disgrace. Iskra declares to the head teacher that she will never do this and faints from over-excitement. The school principal takes the girl into the medical office and praises her for the manifestation of humanity. Having learned about the heroism of her girlfriend and devotion of her compatriots, Vika Lyuberetskaya invites the children to a picnic. Outside the city she confesses her love to classmate Jaur√®s Landys, and the students kiss each other for the first time. In the morning Vika does not come to the Komsomol meeting. When the head teacher sends classmate Zina for her, she returns in a semiconscious state and informs the class that \\"Vika is in the morgue.\\" Iskra is summoned by the investigator and is informed that Lyuberetskaya committed suicide, leaving two suicide notes, including one addressed personally to Polyakova. Vika's classmates learn that there is no one to bury the girl and decide to take care of the burial themselves. Mother of Iskra asks not to read speeches and hold a memorial service; she calls Lyuberetskaya's suicide an act of a \\"namby-pamby\\". However, she goes against the will of the mother and impressed by the school principal speech at the cemetery, reads Yesenin's verses over the grave of her friend. Luberetsky's daughter's funeral is watched from a distance by Sasha Stameskin. He is worried about his future career and does not dare to visit the funeral of the public enemy's daughter in the open. Iskra's verse reading is discovered by her mother and she organizes a scandal with an attempt to use physical force. However, Iskra says that if she once again raises her hand to her, she will leave forever, despite love. Vika's funeral also has consequences for the principal; he is fired. One more month passes by. The shock of Vika Lyuberetskaya's death gradually subsides. After a festive demonstration in honor of November 7, class of 9b visits the former director. In his apartment, the children learn that the Civil War hero is removed from the party. Finals time. Students write an essay, and it is known at this time that Leonid Sergeevich Lyuberetskiy is acquitted and allowed to go home. The class darts off and is in a hurry to support the designer in his grief. The teens find Lyuberetsky among rickety frames and scattered chairs in his apartment who still remembers the NKVD search. \\"What a tough year\\", - says the father of Vika. In an outburst of feelings Zina throws her arms around him and tells him that it is a sad year only because it is a leap one and that the next in 1941 will be very happy. The class freezes. In the scene Red Army soldiers marching through the streets accompanied by the song The Sacred War are visible. The epilogue sounds.

He knew that many directors attempted to get permission to adapt the novel from Goskino but all were rejected. But Kara was granted the right to film the adaptation by his teacher Sergei Gerasimov at VGIK. As the film was his dissertation, it was not taken seriously enough to be under censorship. But after the movie was finished, there was difficulty as the whole Goskino was against the film, but Armen Medvedev from the state committee defended the picture and it was released. Initially the picture was planned as a short, a three-reeler. But the Gorky Film Studio became interested in the film and shooting continued which caused it to become a full-fledged feature film. It was shot without sound or finished text, this is visible in many scenes where the dubbing does not fully match the mouth movements. As it was a student project, many actors played for free in the film. The film's soundtrack includes, besides the classical compositions by Antonio Vivaldi original music from the 1930s. The war, which is about to take place, is indicated with the song The Sacred War. The film is dedicated to Sergei Gerasimov who died before the film was released. It was Natalia Negoda's screen debut, she plays the student Zina in the film. Her mother in the film Yelena Molchenko actually was the same age as Negoda. The parts of the film in which the students were outside of the party's immediate constraints, including scenes in Lyuberetsky's apartment and the students' excursion the day before Vika's suicide, were shot in color, the rest in black and white.

Her lithograph Sheep Resting is in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Early life Anne Miriam Christine Iblings was born on February 17, 1895 in Parkersburg, Butler County, Iowa to Anna (n√©e Paul) and Christopher Iblings. After graduating from Sioux Falls Baptist College, Ibling attended the Minneapolis School of Art, studying three years under Cameron Booth. She then studied for a year at the University of Minnesota before founding with other students, the Art League of Minneapolis. Career From 1935, Ibling was painting murals in and around Minneapolis for the Works Progress Administration (WPA), in addition to working as an art teacher, graphic designer and painter. She created such works as a 1935 lithograph, Sheep Resting, which is currently in the collection of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.; an outdoor scene from 1936 which was featured on a wall in the basement of the Central High School; and a mural painted in fresco- secco, Youth and the Modern World in the Stillwater High School. The work, in the school's auditorium, symbolizes both community growth and the advances made in arts and sciences. In the Lymanhurst Hospital playroom she created a mural called Alice in Wonderland in 1937. In 1938, she painted a mural, Mother Goose in the historic school building, now known as Merrill Hall, at the Minnesota State Public School for Dependent and Neglected Children. Ibling taught classes at the State Reformatory for Women in the 1940s, and an exhibition of their work was shown in March and April, 1940. Her 1941 design, Orchestra, Attending the Opera, and Country Band Concert for Galtier Elementary School, in St. Paul, combined three studies illustrating American music. These were done as silk screens and applied to the wall after completion. The draft sketches for the stylized rhythmic figures for the three sections, \\"Orchestra\\", \\"Attending the Opera\\" and \\"Country Band Concert\\" are currently held in the collection of the Minnesota Historical Society. In 1943, Ibling created murals with Charles Morgan for the Minneapolis Service Men's Center, which was the year that the federal artist's program ended. After her WPA period, Ibling taught until 1946 at Cherry Lawn School in Darien, Connecticut, before relocating to California in the early 1950s. Death and legacy Ibling died on November 9, 1985 in Monterey, Monterey County, California.

When patterns change such as DNA methylation at specific loci, discriminating the phenotypically affected cases from control individuals, this is considered an indication that epigenetic perturbation has taken place that is associated, causally or consequentially, with the phenotype. EWAS Workflow Background The epigenome is governed by both genetic and environmental factors, causing it to be highly dynamic and complex. Epigenetic information exists in the cell as DNA and histone marks, as well as non-coding RNAs. DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns change over time, and vary between developmental stage and tissue type. The main type of DNAm is at cytosines within CpG dinucleotides which is known to be involved in gene expression regulation. DNAm pattern changes have been extensively studied in complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. In a normal cell, the bulk genome is highly methylated at CpGs whereas CpG islands (CPI) at gene promoter regions remain highly unmethylated. Aberrant DNAm is the most common type of molecular abnormally in cancer cells, where the bulk genome because globally ‚Äòhypomethylated‚Äô and CPIs in promoter regions become ‚Äòhypermethylated‚Äô, usually leading to silencing of tumour suppressor genes. More recently, studies on diabetes have uncovered further evidence to support an epigenetic component of diseases, including differences in disease-associated epigenetic marks between monozygotic twins, the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes in the general population, and developmental reprogramming events in which in utero or childhood environments can influence disease outcome in adulthood. Post-translational histone modifications include, but are not limited to, methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation on the core histone tails. These post-translational modifications are read by proteins that can then modify the chromatin state at that locus. Epigenetic variation arises in three distinct ways; it can be inherited and be therefore present in all cells of the adult including the germline (a process known as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance; a controversial phenomenon that has not yet been observed in humans); it can occur randomly and be present in a subset of cells in the adult, the amount of which depending on how early in development the variation occurs; or it can be induced as a result of behavioural or environmental factors. EWAS has previously associated changes in methylation with several diseases and complex conditions which do not have a known epidemiology and therefore are crucial for the identification of epigenetic factors that contribute to or are a consequence of pathogenesis of these diseases. Methods =Types of Study Designs= Retrospective (case-control) Retrospective studies compare unrelated individuals who fall into two categories, controls without the disease or phenotype of interest, and cases who have the phenotype of interest. An advantage of such studies is that many cohorts of case-control samples already exist with available genotype and expression data that can be integrated with epigenome data. A downside, however, is that they cannot determine whether epigenetic differences are a result of disease-associated genetic differences, post-disease processes or disease-associated drug interventions. Family studies Useful to study transgenerational inheritance patterns of epigenetic marks. A main limitation of EWAS is deciphering if a phenotype is associated with epigenetic changes as a result of a variable in question or a result of previous genomic variants leading to epigenetic alterations. Comparisons between parent and offspring genomic and epigenomic data allows one to rule out the possibility that a disease or phenotype is due to genomic variation. A limitation of this study design is that very few cohorts which are large enough exist. Monozygotic twin studies Monozygotic twins carry identical genomic information. Therefore, if they are discordant for a particular disease or phenotype it is likely a result of epigenetic differences. However, unless the twins are studied longitudinally it is impossible to determine if epigenetic variation is the cause of or consequence of disease. Another limitation is recruiting a large enough cohort of discordant monozygotic twins with the disease of interest. Longitudinal cohorts Longitudinal studies follow a cohort of individuals over an extended period of time, usually from birth or before disease onset. Samples are taken and records are kept over many years, making these studies extremely useful to determine causality of particular phenotypes. Since the same individuals are followed at time points before and after disease onset, it removes the confounding effects of differences between cases and controls. Longitudinal studies are not only useful for risk studies (using DNA samples prior to disease onset), but also in intervention studies using pre- and posttreatment with specific exposures to investigate environmental impacts on the epigenome. A major disadvantage is the long timeline of the studies as well as the expense. Longitudinal studies using disease-discordant monozygotic twins gives the added benefit of ruling out genetic influences on epigenetic variation. =Tissue of Interest= The tissue specificity of epigenomic marks create another challenge when designing an EWAS. Tissue choice is limited by both accessibility and stability of epigenetic patterning. It is crucial to choose a tissue in which epigenetic marks are variable in the population yet stable over time. If this isn't possible, it would be required to use multiple serially collected samples from the same individuals to report robust associations with a particular phenotype. EWAS for diseases are often measured using DNA methylation in blood samples because disease-relevant tissues are difficult to obtain. In some cases, the pattern of methylation is not necessarily biologically relevant to the proposed phenotype. The choice of blood also requires stringent analysis and careful interpretation due to variable cell type composition. Choosing a surrogate tissue therefore requires that the interindividual differences correlate between the tissue of interest and the surrogate, but also for the exposure to induce similar changes in both tissues. To date, an underlying issue is that there is no clear evidence that, in general, epigenetic marks respond to environmental exposures in a similar way across tissues. Methylation assay workflow. From:Illumina Methylation Assay =Quantification Method: DNA Methylation= The platform for epigenome-wide DNAm quantification utilizes the high throughput technology Illumina Methylation Assay. In the past, the 27k Illumina array covered on average two CpG sites in the promoter regions of approximately 14,000 genes and represented less than 0.1% of the 28 million CpG sites in the human genome. This falls short of being representative of the entire human epigenome. None of the early EWAS using this array used independent validation to verify the associated probes. An interesting observation was a bias in the differences between cases and controls towards non-CpG island probes (which were significantly underrepresented in this array design), arguing strongly for the use of the latterly designed 450k array which does cover non-CpG islands with a higher density of probes. Presently, the Illumina 450k array is the most widely used platform in the last two years for studies reporting EWAS. The array still only covers less than 2% of the CpG sites in the genome, but does attempt to cover all known genes with a high density of probes in the promoters (including CpG islands and surrounding sequences), but also covers with a lower density across the gene bodies, 3‚Ä≤ untranslated regions, and other intergenic sequences. Data Analysis and Interpretation =Site-by-site analysis= DNA methylation is typically quantified on a scale of 0‚Äì1, as the methylation array measures the proportion of DNA molecules that are methylated at a particular CpG site. The initial analyses performed are univariate tests of association to identify sites where DNA methylation varies with exposure and/or phenotype. This is followed by multiple testing corrections and utilizing an analytical strategy to reduce batch effects and other technical confounding effects in the quantification of DNA methylation. The potential confounding effects arising from alterations in tissue composition is also taken into account. Additionally, adjusting for confounding factors such as age, gender and behaviours that may influence the methylation status as covariates is conducted. The association results are also corrected for the genomic control inflation factor in order to account for the population stratification. Generally, mean levels of CpG methylation are compared across categories using linear regression which allows for the adjustment of confounders and batch effects. A P-value threshold of P < 1e-7 is generally used to identify CpGs associated with the tested phenotype/stimulus. These CpGs are considered to reach epigenome-wide significance. An effect size is also calculated at this significance level, indicating the difference in methylation when comparing two qualitative groups, or different quantitative values depending on your phenotype. CpG sites significantly associated with the phenotype and/or treatment/environmental stimulus are typically represented in a manhattan plot. =Regional Changes Analysis= Single CpG sites are prone to single site natural variation effects and technical variation such as bad microarray probes and outliers. To make more robust associations and take into account such variation, using adjacent measurements can help increase power. In previous studies, functionally relevant findings have been associated with genomic regions as opposed to single CpGs. Therefore, looking at the regional level can help identify associated regions with more confidence, guiding downstream functional studies. =Pre-clustering or Grouping of CpG sites= Another method of analysis is using unsupervised clustering to create classes of CpG sites based on similarity of methylation variation across samples. The average methylation values within each class is used to construct data sets of reduced dimensionality, facilitating efficient tests of association between DNA methylation and phenotypes of interest. This is used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets and take advantage of substantial biologically induced correlation. This method is useful for identifying gross patterns of methylation associated with the tested variable, but may miss specific CpG sites of interest. Besides differences in mean methylation levels, differences in variation of DNA methylation across samples may also be biologically meaningful, motivating scans for differential variability between groups. =Functional and Gene Set Enrichment= The location of the associated CpG sites or islands/regions can then be analyzed in silico to imply possible functional relevance. For example, considering whether the associated CpGs are within a promoter region or determining distance from the transcription start site that may be relevant, especially when we assume that DNA methylation associated with a phenotype acts by regulating gene transcription. Many other inferences based on past biological knowledge can be inferred if that particular region of CpGs have been studied and associated with changes in transcription. This can be used as an additional filter for identifying regions to pursue for functional validation. Several bioinformatic tools that have been developed for functional enrichment analysis can be applied to differentially methylated regions by first mapping these regions to genes. This is done by mapping the distance between the CpGs and a gene promoter that is potentially regulated by this region. Enrichment analysis based on the genomic region has thus been suggested as a complementary approach and confers substantial interpretive potential. Differentially methylated regions can then be compared to a catalog of genomic regions including, for example, sites enriched for specific chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding sites. =Methylation Odds Ratio= A methylation odds ratio can be calculated if we consider the mean methylation rate at a site in cases (or controls) to represent the methylation probability for a randomly chosen DNA strand in the case (or control) tissue samples. The methylation odds ratio is the odds for a random DNA strand in the tissue sample from a random case to be methylated, divided by the same odds for controls. This provides a measure of effect size that incorporates relative magnitudes, but also does not allow for the difference between cases and controls of features of the methylation spectrum, such as variance. The methylation odds ratio is also comparable across prospective and retrospective studies and its value only measures association and does not imply causation. Methylation risk scores have also been calculated which can integrate information across CpG sites by calculating a weighted methylation risk score as the sum of methylation values at each of the markers associated with the phenotype, weighted by marker-specific effect size =Replication= Replication using an independent cohort is required to rule out false positives identified in the initial study. This can be done in a human cohort or in a more focused manner in animal models. It is important that, when selecting the replication cohort, the individuals are reflective of the initial cohort and that the same confounding variables are taken into account. Replication, however, can be limited due to the availability of individuals and samples. Limitations and Concerns =Causality or Consequence= Variations in the epigenome can cause disease but can also arise as a consequence of disease, and distinguishing between the two is a major limitation in EWAS. A way to circumvent this is to determine whether the epigenetic variation is present before any symptoms of disease, preferably via longitudinal studies following the same cohort of people over many years (this in itself has its own setbacks of expense and study time frame). Also needed to be taken into consideration is the possibility that epigenetic variation which arises before disease onset does not necessarily constitute causation for disease. =Sample heterogeneity= The most commonly used tissue an EWAS is blood. However, blood samples contain multiple different cell types each of which have a unique epigenetic signature. In this way, it is extremely difficult to determine if the sample you have taken is homogeneous and is therefore difficult to determine if the variation in epigenetic marks are due to the differences in phenotype/stimulus or due to the sample heterogeneity. =Tissue availability= Currently many EWAS use blood as a surrogate tissue due to its availability and ease of collection. However, epigenetic changes in the blood may not be associated with the changes in the particular tissue associated with the disease. Many intriguing disorders that could have epigenetic causative factors affect tissues such as brain, lung, heart, etc. However, when studying human patients it is not an option to take these tissues for sampling, and they are therefore left unstudied.  Related Database  = EWAS Atlas = EWAS Atlas (http://bigd.big.ac.cn/ewas) is a curated knowledgebase of EWAS that provides a comprehensive collection of EWAS knowledge. Unlike extant data-oriented epigenetic resources, EWAS Atlas features manual curation of EWAS knowledge from extensive publications. In the current implementation, EWAS Atlas focuses on DNA methylation‚Äîone of the key epigenetic marks; it integrates a large number of 388,851 high-quality EWAS associations, involving 126 tissues/cell lines and covering 351 traits, 2,230 cohorts and 390 ontology entities, which are completely based on manual curation from 649 studies reported in 495 publications. In addition, it is equipped with a powerful trait enrichment analysis tool, which is capable of profiling trait-trait and trait-epigenome relationships. Future developments include regular curation of recent EWAS publications, incorporation of more epigenetic marks and possible integration of EWAS with GWAS. Collectively, EWAS Atlas is dedicated to the curation, integration and standardization of EWAS knowledge and has the great potential to help researchers dissect molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modifications associated with biological traits. = EWAS Data Hub = EWAS Data Hub (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ewas/datahub) is a resource for collecting and normalizing DNA methylation array data as well as archiving associated metadata. The current release of EWAS Data Hub integrates a comprehensive collection of DNA methylation array data from 75 344 samples and employs an effective normalization method to remove batch effects among different datasets. Accordingly, taking advantages of both massive high-quality DNA methylation data and standardized metadata, EWAS Data Hub provides reference DNA methylation profiles under different contexts, involving 81 tissues/cell types (that contain 25 brain parts and 25 blood cell types), six ancestry categories, and 67 diseases (including 39 cancers). In summary, EWAS Data Hub bears great promise to aid the retrieval and discovery of methylation-based biomarkers for phenotype characterization, clinical treatment and health care.

It was introduced by S. Klaubauf, M.H. Lebrun & P.W. Crous in 2014.  Taxonomy  Type genus: Pyricularia Sacc. 1880 Type species: Pyricularia grisea Sacc. 1880 The polyphyletic nature of Pyricularia has been resolved in 2014 leading to the definition of a new family, the Pyriculariaceae. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three clear clades could be distinguished. One clade corresponds to Magnaporthaceae (based on Nakataea), and two other clades were defined as new families: Pyriculariaceae (based on Pyricularia), and Ophioceraceae (based on Ophioceras).  Description  The Pyriculariaceae that reproduce sexually form perithecial fruiting bodies (ascomata), which are immersed, black and with long cylindrical necks covered in setae. Asci are subcylindrical, unitunicate, short-stipitate and with a large apical ring staining in Meltzer's iodine reagent. Ascospores are septate and fusiform. Asexual morphs are hyphomycetes with simple, branched conidiophores. Asexual spores (conidia) are hyaline to brown in colour with transverse septa. The typical pyriform shape and 2-septate conidium morphology is characteristic for Pyricularia and Neopyricularia. Other genera have obclavate to more ellipsoid 2-septate conidia. Deightoniella and Macgarvieomyces evolved 1-septate conidia. An identification key to genera of Pyriculariaceae is provided by Maharachchikumbura et al (2016) = Differentiation from other families = Pyriculariaceae is distinguished from Magnaporthaceae by their asexual morphs. Pyricularia or pyricularia-like species are characterised by pyriform 2-septate conidia and rhexolytic secession. In the case of Magnaporthaceae, morphology of phialophora- or harpophora-like species is characterised by falcate versicoloured conidia on brown, erect conidiophores. Genera * Bambusicularia * Barretomyces * Macgarvieomyces * Neocordana * Neopyricularia * Proxipyricularia * Pseudopyricularia * Pyricularia * Xenopyricularia  Ecology  Pyriculariaceae are saprobic or plant pathogenic fungi on various plant hosts, commonly on monocots. Their host spectrum includes many grasses (Poaceae), and also ginger, sedges, rushes and commelina. Blast diseases by Pyriculariaceae are caused by use of an appressorium to penetrate the host. = Economic significance = Species of Pyriculariaceae cause major diseases on grasses, among which Pyricularia oryzae (sexual morph Magnaporthe oryzae) is responsible for the devastating disease of rice (rice blast). P. oryzae can also infect other host plants, such as Eleusine, Oryza, Setaria or Triticum. Other Pyricularia species can infect Cenchrus, Echinochloa, Lolium, Pennisetum or Zingiber.

The club plays their home matches at the Stade de la Ville en Bois, which has a capacity of 3,000. History Voltigeurs de Ch√¢teaubriant was founded in 1907, and the football section appeared around 1920. Originally the club also had gymnastics and tennis sections, but these are no longer active. The football team has played in regional leagues for the vast majority of its existence, with varying levels of success. Ch√¢teaubriant won the Division d'Honneur (DH) Ouest in 1958 but declined promotion to the next tier, allowing Stade Brestois 29 to be promoted in their place. This was to be their only league title until 1991, when the club won the DH Atlantique, thereby gaining promotion to Division 4, the equivalent of the current CFA. In 1993, as part of the restructuring of the French league system, the club was moved to the newly formed National 3, the fifth tier of the pyramid. Relegation back to the regional divisions followed in 1997. The 2013‚Äì14 and 2014‚Äì15 seasons saw Ch√¢teaubriant achieve successive promotions, winning the DH Atlantique and then the CFA2 Group A, to return to the fourth level of French football for the first time in over 20 years.

Ejecta mobility of layered ejecta craters on Mars: Assessing the influence of snow and ice deposits. Icarus: 233, 131-146. Rampart craters Rampart craters shows fluidized ejecta features. They look like mud was formed during the impact. There are several basic types of rampart craters. The single-layered ejecta type has a single rampart at the edge of the ejecta. It is thought that these impacted into an icy layer, but did not go through the layer.Baratoux, D. 2002.

Standardizing the nomenclature of Martian impact crater ejecta morphologies. J. Geophysical Res. 105, 26733_26738. Mars rampart crater.jpgMultiple-layer ejecta crater A study of the distribution of these craters demonstrated that the thickness of a frozen layer on Mars varies from about 1.3 km (equator) to 3.3 km (poles). This represents a great deal of frozen water. It would be equal to 200 meters of water spread over the entire planet, if one assumes the ground has 20% pore space. The researchers assumed that the single-layer ejecta craters would all be within the icy layer, but the double and multiple layer ejecta craters would always penetrate the icy layer.Barlow, N., T.

Multiple-layer ejecta craters go all the way through the icy layer and somewhat into the lower, ice-free layer (right). Pancake Craters In the Mariner and Viking missions a type of crater was found that was called a \\"Pancake Crater.\\" It is similar to a rampart crater, but does not have a rampart. The ejecta is flat along its whole area, like a pancake. Under higher resolutions it resembles a double-layer crater that has degraded. These craters are found in the same latitudes as double-layer craters (40-65 degrees).Mouginis-Mark, P. 1979. Martian fluidized crater morphology: Variations with crater size, latitude, altitude, and target material. Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth: 84, 8011-8022.

Pockets came to media attention in 2011 when the sanctuary held a fundraiser featuring 40 paintings by the monkey.  Early life  According to the sanctuary, Pockets was born on April 1, 1992, and lived his early life as a pet in British Columbia. In 2009, Pockets' owner was finding herself challenged to look after him, and searched for a place that could take him. On finding Story Book Farm, she flew herself and Pockets to Ontario, and stayed with Pockets for a week to get him comfortable in his new home. The former owner still keeps in touch with the sanctuary.  His start as an artist  Pockets Warhol painting \\"Queen\\" Shortly after Pockets arrived at the sanctuary, one of the volunteers, Charmaine Quinn, gave Pockets his surname of Warhol because his white hair reminded her of Andy Warhol. This also prompted Quinn to give Pockets some children's paints to keep him busy, and he has never looked back. In December 2011, having accumulated 40 of Pockets' paintings, the sanctuary arranged an exhibition of the paintings at a Toronto diner, helping to raise funds for the sanctuary. The event was covered in the Toronto Star, which in turn triggered international media coverage in/on: CBC, Global News, the Huffington Post (USA), MacLeans, and Vv Magazine. A few months later, Pockets paintings were made available for sale online.  Art collaboration  In Sept 2013, Brent Roe and Scott Cameron (aka Scotch Camera) joined an art show with Pockets Warhol at the Gladstone hotel in Toronto. In Sept 2014, MacLeans listed Pockets as the #8 top selling art animal in the world, based on the top price fetched for a single item. According to Quinn, Pockets' work has been featured in art shows as far away as Estonia, Finland, and Italy, and purchased online from as far away as Tasmania. In May 2016, Anita Kunz visited Pockets at the sanctuary, and subsequently donated one of her own paintings for Pockets to 'enhance'. Ms. Kunz later organized an art show with 80 other artists as a new fundraiser for the sanctuary, held at The Papermill Gallery, Todmorden Mills from April 6‚Äì16, 2017. Other participants in this collaboration included: Barry Blitt, Marc Burckhardt, Cynthia von Buhler, Seymour Chwast, Sue Coe, Yuri Dojc, Louis Fishauf, Jill Greenberg, Terry Mosher, Tim O'Brien, Ralph Steadman, Ann Telnaes and Martin Wittfooth.  Celebrity interactions  In April 2012, sanctuary volunteers Charmaine Quinn and Izzy Hirji presented Dr. Jane Goodall with a photo of Pockets and a painting by Pockets for her birthday at the Jane Goodall Institute in Toronto. In March 2015, the sanctuary sent a painting by Pockets to Ricky Gervais and Jane Fallon as a 'Thank you' for their support of animal rights. In June 2015, Ricky Gervais tweeted that he was donating an acoustic guitar to the sanctuary, with mention of Pockets Warhol. After his performance in Toronto in September 2015, Gervais donated the guitar he used there, which subsequently raised US$4,150 in an online auction. The winning bidder lives in the United Kingdom. As of Feb 15, 2019 the guitar is up for auction again having been signed by several other celebrities: Brian May, Peter Frampton, Will Ferrell, Bryan Cranston, Dhani Harrison, Ricky Warwick, Steve Cutts. This time the proceeds will be split between Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary and Brian May's Save Me organization.  Mention in Books and Media  In June 2017, Pockets was featured in a PodCast by Phil Sansom of Cam FM at University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. In March 2018, National Geographic Learning published the second edition of their Wonderful World series, in volume 1 of which a picture of Pockets painting is included, with a description of what he does. In March 2019, a new book by Grant Hayter-Menzies called \\"Woo, the Monkey Who Inspired Emily Carr: A Biography\\" (Paperback ‚Äì Mar 2 2019) devotes the last chapter to Pockets and the other primate residents of Story Book Farm Primate Sanctuary. Two more podcasts featured Pockets in 2019. PORTRAIT OF POCKETS, a CBC Gem Original Documentary directed by Brina Romanek began streaming Friday, February 21, 2020. It tells the story of a monkey, a woman and the paintings that made them famous.

In 1876, he was a prominent member of the Romanian Democratic Union. He served as Minister of Justice twice during the long years of PNL government: from July 1880 to April 1881, and again at the very end, in March 1888. He was a participant in the two crucial political acts of this period: the recognition of Romania's independence (1878) and its proclamation as a kingdom (1881). As minister, he took the initiative for building the Palace of Justice, naming a committee that drafted the initial plans.

At the age of eight, happening to read an article on drawing, she tried her pencil at reproducing the simple cuts given in it for copying, with a success so surprising to herself that she then and there resolved to become an artist. Thereafter, she received training in drawing. In 1872, Cobb entered the Hungerford Collegiate Institute at Adams, where she studied for two years. The family removed to Syracuse.

During that time, in 1888, she was one of a large party to visit the United Kingdom and France. In 1890, she was married to Professor Herbert Edgar Cobb, a member of the faculty at the Maine Wesleyan Seminary and a graduate of the Wesleyan University at Middletown, Connecticut. In the same year, her husband was called to a position on the faculty of the Colorado State University. At this university Mrs. Cobb was a teacher of drawing from 1890 to 1892. In the latter year, she and her husband removed to Chicago, Illinois, where her husband was employed for a time in the Extension Department of the University of Chicago, afterwards receiving a position on the faculty of the Lewis Institute, where he headed the Mathematical Department. In 1906 and 1907, her husband had leave of absence from the Lewis Institute, to pursue higher mathematical studies at the University of Berlin. Maxson-Cobb accompanied her husband on this trip, and taking art lectures at the University of Berlin. Personal life Cobb was engaged in philanthropic work and the study of social science since 1892. A strong literary taste and sympathy for active philanthropic and Christian enterprise led her into many additional types of work. Her numerous poems, stories told in verse, translations from the German, travel correspondence, and articles on art subjects were included in prominent publications. Cobb was a believer in united action, and in the many societies to which she belonged, missionary, temperance, art, literary and scientific, she was recognized as a superior organizer and leader. Geology, microscopy and photography claimed a share of her attention, and she had an interesting collection of specimens of her own finding, slides of her own mounting and photographs of her own taking. She delighted in music and had a cultivated contralto voice. Cobb died January 24, 1917 from apoplexy at the Frances Willard Hospital in Chicago, Illinois, after a very brief illness, and was buried in Union Cemetery, Adams Center, New York.

The Roraima National Forest was created by decree n¬∫ 97545 of 1 March 1989 and covered of the Amazon biome. This had the effect of dividing the territory of the Yanomami people into several separate areas. In 1990 three gold mining reserves were created within the Roraima National Forest. The Yanomami Indigenous Territory was demarcated in 1992 in the lead up to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The indigenous territory was created on 25 May 1992 with an area of , and it was thought that this territory completely covered the national forest area. This was followed by a vigorous international campaign in support of the Yanomami people. The gold mines were closed and the miners removed. In an indigenous territory the indigenous people have the exclusive right of use according to their customs and traditions. Although technically the Roraima National Forest remained, exploitation of the forest would violate these rights. In 2001 IBAMA realized that 5% of the forest, or , had been left out of the indigenous territory, and decided to repossess the unit. However, in the mid-1990s two settlements, Sama√∫ma and Vila Nova, had taken , leaving unclaimed. To regularize the situation, the boundaries were revised by law 12058 of 13 October 2009.

It has invaded the eastern Mediterranean from the Red Sea by way of the Suez Canal, a process known as Lessepsian migration. Description Arcuatula perfragilis has a pale green, equivalve shell with a few yellowish radial lines on the dorsal to posterior portion of the valves. The valves are typical mussel-shaped in that they are narrowly ovoid and transversely elongated. The periostracum is shiny. The surface of the valve has a very weak pattern of radiating lines which is discernible only by the strong ligament along the hinge line typical of the family mytilidae. This hinge has between 1 and 5 small dysodont teeth at the anterior end with a further15 towards the posterior part beyond the ligament. The shell length is normally 20mm. It can be identified from Arcuatula senhousia in the Mediterranean by its having a darker, less shiny, more rounded shell and because it possesses less distinct, fewer, smaller riblets anterior to the umbones. Distribution Arcuatula perfragilis has an Indo- Pacific distribution and occurs from the Red Sea east to Japan. It was first recorded in the Mediterranean off Israel in 1960 but was initially misidentified as Arcuatula glaberrima (then named as Modiolus glabberrimus), it has now spread as far as Turkey.

It was founded before the Republican People's Party under the leadership of Nezihe Muhiddin.  About  When the republic was declared in 1923, Nezihe Muhiddin and thirteen women decided to gather a women's committee for women's rights. Although the preparations were held in the house of Nezihe Muhiddin, the first meeting of the committee took place in Dar√ºlf√ºnun Conference Hall (Istanbul University) on 15 June 1923. In the meeting, a decision was taken to establish a political party named \\"Women's People Party\\". The schedule of the party took place in the press at that time. The party, led by Nezihe Muhiddin, completed the works and submitted the petition to found the party even before the Republican People's Party. Eight months later, governorship refused the request and gave no permission to establish the party on the grounds that \\"political representation of women was not possible according to the election law of 1909\\". In response, the Women 's People Party transformed into an association, the Turkish Women's Union.  Turkish Women's Union  Nezihe Muhiddin was the leader of Turkish Women's Union that aimed to \\"raise womanhood to a modern and experienced level by uplifting them in intellectual and social areas\\". Later in 1924, she founded a journal, T√ºrk Kadƒ±n Yolu with her own means and released 18 issues. The content of the journal was particularly about the announcement of women's political demands.

After a series of tests at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, the prototypes were approved as M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and M32E4. However, the M32E4 never entered production. There were also variants that had Horizontal Volute Spring Suspension (HVSS), which were demarcated by an A1 after the model. Lima Locomotive started production of the vehicles in June 1943, with five M32B2s and 46 M32B3s. Pressed Steel Car produced 163 M32s and 475 M32B1s in 1944. They also produced 298 M32B3s. Baldwin Locomotive produced 195 M32B1s, while 398 M32B1s were produced by Federal Machine before the end of 1944. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime Movers, used to pull heavy artillery. The M32s were used after 1944 during Operation Overlord and subsequent battles in the European Theater of Operations. It was also used during the Korean War. It was phased out after the introduction of the M74 Tank Recovery Vehicle in 1954, when heavier tanks were produced, such as the M46 Patton. The M32 had a winch, boom, and an A-frame jib. It was armed with two machine guns and a mortar mainly to provide cover for an emergency retreat. Specifications The M32 Tank Recovery Vehicle was an armored recovery vehicle based on the chassis of the M4 Sherman, adding an boom, an A-frame jib, and a winch. It was long, adding when the boom, which is used to lift damaged vehicles, was fully extended. The width was and the height was . It weighed either (M32, M32B1, and M32B3), or (M32B2) depending on the model. The engine varied between which variant of the M4 Sherman it was based upon, so the M32 and M32B1 model had a Continental R975-C1 or -C4 9 cylinder radial gasoline engine, running at 2,400 rpm, the M32B2 model had a General Motors 6046 twin diesel engine; running at 2,100 rpm, and the M32B3 model had a Ford GAA V8 gasoline engine running at 2,600 rpm. The engines varied depending on the variant of the M4 Sherman the vehicle was based on because M32s were based on the M4 Sherman. The range and fuel capacity varied between and respectively depending on the engine. However, top speed remained constant at .Doyle (2011), p. 413.Hogg (2014), p. 40. It had a Spicer manual synchromesh transmission, with one reverse and five forward gears. The suspension was VVSS for earlier variants, and HVSS for variants demarcated with an A1. It had between of armor depending on location. It had an armament that consisted of an 81 mm mortar, which was used to cover emergency retreats, and a M2 Browning machine gun combined with a M1919 machine gun. There were 20 hand grenades (Fragmentation Mk.II), and six smoke grenades in the crew compartment. The armament was used only for self-defense, as the vehicle was not designed to be used as an offensive weapon. Development history In early 1942, the US Army began mobilizing and reequipping for war in Europe. Based on British combat experience from earlier in the war, the United States Ordnance Department determined that the army would need vehicles that could be used to recover armored vehicles that had been damaged in combat. The British had already developed several armored recovery vehicles based on the M4 Sherman such as the AVRE and the BARV; however, the Ordnance Department did not wish to use these variants and ordered several new ARV prototypes to be developed, also based on the M4 Sherman.Ware (2014), pp. 109‚Äì110. The basic prototypes of the M32 were created by Lima Locomotive on January 11, 1943. The prototypes were labeled T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and T5E4. These designs competed against the T2 and T7 designs, which both had a turret mounted boom, at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The T5 was declared superior to the T2 and T7 designs after several weeks of testing. The four prototypes were sent to Aberdeen (T5 and T5E1), Camp Hood (T5E2), and Camp Seely (T5E4). However, during the testing the T5E3's engine was damaged, so it could not go through further testing. OCM 21553 standardized the designs of the T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and the T5E4 as the M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and the M32E4 in June 1943. This protocol also terminated the T7 project. However, the M32E4 did not enter production.Hunnicutt (1971), pp. 474‚Äì476. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime Movers, which were used to tow heavy artillery. The M34s were unarmed, and had special equipment to pull heavy artillery.Hogg (2014), p. 81. Production history The production of the M32 was started by Lima Locomotive, which converted five M32B2s in June 1943. They also intermittently produced 26 M32B3s in May 1944, followed by 20 more vehicles in the summer of 1944. Pressed Steel Car produced 163 M32s and 475 M32B1s from December 1943 to December 1944. Pressed Steel Car also converted 298 M4A3 Shermans into M32B3s between May and December 1944. Baldwin Locomotive Works and Federal Machine were licensed to produce M32 variants in November 1944. Baldwin Locomotive Works produced 195 M32B1s before June 1945 and the latter produced 385 M32B1s before May of that year. In total, 1562 M32s were produced. Service history An M32B1A1 recovery vehicle backing up into a ditch after passing a bridge on the road to Hamhung during the Korean War. The M32 entered service with the US Army in July 1943. They served in the Italian Campaign,Caddick- Adams (2013), p. 197. Operation Overlord, and many other battles in the European Theater of Operations. The A1 variants, which were converted by Baldwin Locomotive in 1945, also served until the end of the Korean War.Hunnicutt (1971), p. 477. The M74 Tank Recovery Vehicle replaced the M32B1A1s after the Korean War in 1954Brown (2001), p. 27. after the production of heavier tanks such as the M46 Patton.Hunnicutt (1971), p. 478. The M32 was considered inadequate for its role as an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to move over poor terrain such as mud and the power of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 131. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored Recovery Vehicle in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became too expensive, and so was never put on the production line.Zaloga (2000), p. 34. The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine Exploder. However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969), p. 121. Several M32s were loaned to the Israeli Army in the late 1940s by the U.S. They saw service in the Suez Crisis, Six-Day War, and Yom Kippur War to tow M51 Super Shermans.Haskew (2016), p. 216. Several M32s saw service in the Mexican Army under the nickname \\"Chenca\\" until 1998. The U.S. loaned Mexico these M32s shortly after World War II.Haskew (2016, p. 218. Some M32 and M32Bs were also sent to Tito's Yugoslavia during the Informbiro period.

It was typically reserved for pulling heavy artillery, such as the 240 mm howitzer.Bishop (2002), p. 60. It lacked any armament and had four seats for crew. The vehicle also had tail lights, electric outlets for stopping of towed loads, and multiple stowage ports. Production started in 1944 and ended in 1945. =Additional equipment= *T1E1 Mine Exploder \\"Earthworm\\" ‚Äì This mine exploding equipment, which was meant to be used with the boom on the M32, was essentially the T1 mine exploder with slightly different trailing discs.

On 14 September 2016, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced the technology, which allows a single font file to store a continuous range of design variants. Technology OpenType variable fonts are an adaptation of Apple's TrueType GX font variations to OpenType, with integration into key aspects of the OpenType format including OpenType Layout tables and both TrueType and CFF glyph outline formats. It also surpasses TrueType GX by providing better interoperability, both between different fonts, and between variable fonts and font-formatting specifications such as those found in Cascading Style Sheets. The technology allows software to access any design instance for a continuous range of designs defined within the font. When a specific design instance has been selected, the glyph outlines or other data values for that design instance are computed as font data is being processed during text layout and rasterization. The technology uses interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms that have been supported in font-development tools and used by font designers for many years. In that paradigm, the font designer creates a variable design, but then chooses specific instances to generate as static, non-variable fonts that get distributed to customers. With variable fonts, however, the font produced and distributed by the font designer can have built-in variability, and the interpolation mechanisms can now be built into operating systems and Web browsers or other applications, with specific design instances selected at time of use. One of the key benefits of the technology is that it can significantly reduce the combined size of font data whenever multiple styles are in use. On the Web, this may allow a site to use more font styles while at the same time reducing page load times. A further benefit is that it gives access to a continuous range of style variations, which can provide benefits for responsive design. The technology has been compared to Adobe's multiple master fonts (MM fonts) technology, also from the 1990s, which used on-the-fly generation of font designs from master files by interpolation and extrapolation. Multiple master fonts, however, required the user to generate a specific \\"instance\\" of the font for particular variation-axis values before it could be used. This is not required for OpenType variable fonts, however: named or arbitrary design instances can be selected and used on demand. Adoption In Windows 10, version 1709, Microsoft introduced the first variable font in Windows: the \\"Bahnschrift\\" font, which is a digitisation of DIN 1451. Adobe Creative Cloud 2018 version, released 18 October 2017, includes support for variable fonts in Photoshop and Illustrator and includes variable concept versions of the fonts Acumin, Minion, Myriad, Source Code, Source Sans, and Source Serif. Creative Cloud 2020 has added variable font support for InDesign.https://indesignsecrets.com/whats-new-with-indesign- cc-2020.php Inkscape version 1.0 has added variable font support.

Barnard was commissioned to create the sculptures in 1902, and modeled them in clay and plaster over several years in France. Piccirilli Brothers carved them in white Carrara marble in New York City, and installed the finished sculptures at the Capitol.Harold E. Dickson, \\"Barnard's Sculptures for the Pennsylvania Capitol,\\" The Art Quarterly, vol. 22, no. 2 (April 1959), pp. 127-147. The south group is titled The Burden of Life: The Broken Law, and is overseen by a heroic size bas relief of Adam and Eve. It portrays life struggles and negative emotions - widowhood, toil, grief, despair - but with the possibility of consolation and hope. The north group is titled Love and Labor: The Unbroken Law, and is overseen by a heroic size bas relief of a prosperous farmer and his wife. It portrays life accomplishments and positive emotions - familial love, education, parenthood, religion - and the promise of the future generation. History Love and Labor: The Unbroken Law Joseph Miller Huston, the Capitol's architect, chose Barnard in 1902 to create exterior sculpture for the building. The initial sculpture program, conceived by Barnard and Huston, called for eight sculpture groups - a pair flanking each of the building's four entrances - as well as an \\"enormous bronze composition along the skyline of the main entrance fa√ßade.\\" The latter was to represent the Apotheosis of Labor, and be supported by four pairs of caryatids depicting different types of laborers. The groups flanking the main entrances on the east and west facades were to depict \\"primitive people.\\" The groups flanking the entrances to the House and Senate wings (on the west fa√ßade) were to depict early settlers of Pennsylvania--English, Quakers, Scotch-Irish and Germans.Craven, p. 446. The estimated cost for this program, about $700,000, was enough to ensure that it was never executed. By the time Barnard signed a three-year contract in December 1902, the sculpture program had been reduced to the two large groups flanking the main entrance (west fa√ßade), and his fee had been reduced to $300,000. The sculptor and his family then moved to France, where they obtained a large barn that was converted into a studio in which the groups were created.Frederick C. Moffatt, Errant Bronzes: George Grey Barnard's Statues of Abraham Lincoln, University of Delaware Press, Newark, 1998. In his studio at Moret-sur-Loing Barnard hired as many as fifteen assistants, including a plaster caster who transformed Barnard's clay figures into plaster. However, the contracted funds were slow in arriving and eventually stopped, and in 1906 a huge scandal erupted involving massive financial irregularities that eventually landed Huston and others in jail. Barnard's assistants continued to work for him in the hope that they would eventually be paid, and this was accomplished by Barnard's collecting old Gothic and Romanesque sculpture remnants from the French countryside and selling them.\\"Barnard's Mighty sculptures for the Pennsylvania Capitol,\\" Current Literature, vol. 49, no. 2 (August 1910), pp. 207-09. There remained the problem of purchasing the marble that would be needed to carve the figures. Eventually, a group of New York luminaries advanced funds for that purpose, as well as paying the bond that Barnard had lost because he had not delivered the works on time. =1908 Boston exhibition= Several plasters of the sculptures on display in Barnard's Paris studio, 1909. Five heroic-size plaster sculptures for the Pennsylvania Capitol groups - The Prodigal Son, Brothers, The Young Parents, Kneeling Youth, Forsaken Mother - were part of an exhibition of Barnard's work at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in October‚ÄìNovember 1908.William Howe Downes, \\"Mr. Barnard's Exhibit in Boston, Which Appealed to the Connoisseur and the Crowd Alike,\\" The World's Work, vol. 17, no. 4 (February 1909), pp. 11267-11269. Also exhibited were his plaster scale models of the complete sculpture groups.Ernest Knaufft, \\"George Grey Barnard: A Virile American Sculptor,\\" The American Review of Reviews, vol. 38, no. 6 (December 1908), pp. 689-92. In a review in The International Studio, critic J. Nilsen Laurvik compared Barnard to Auguste Rodin and the recently- deceased Augustus Saint-Gaudens, concluding: \\"[H]e is the one man most needed in the art life of our country; his work is like an invigorating breath of fresh sea air that must surely have its influence in giving a more vital and higher meaning to both life and art. ... [H]e is a unique personality in the art life of our country and one of the few truly great sculptors of our time.\\"J. Nilsen Laurvik, \\"George Grey Barnard,\\" The International Studio, vol. 36, no. 142 (December 1908), pp. 39-48. Critic William Howe Downes also enthusiastically praised his work: > Wherever Mr. Barnard touches humanity in his work, it is with the desire and > the power to glorify it, to show its greatness, to bring out all that is > heroic and tender and lovable in it. Nothing is more certain than that this > is understood, that the appeal has met with an instant response. > The understanding thus established between the artist and his public is the > more to be welcomed because, up to a quite recent period, it had been felt > by many observers that the modern school of sculpture was a hollow sort of > survival, without much reason for being. Saint-Gaudens did much to modify > such an impression in this country by uniting in a serious and touching way > the strands of national consciousness with aesthetic sensibility. It > remained for Mr. Barnard to create a still more universal artistic language > for still more universal ideas, and to place before us the nude human being > transformed into new shapes of undying beauty and majesty.William Howe > Downes, \\"Mr. Barnard's Exhibit in Boston,\\" The World's Work, vol. 17, no. 4 > (February 1909), p. 11269. =1910 Paris Salon= The groups were carved in marble by the Piccirilli Brothers in New York City in 1909 and 1910,Craven, p. 448. and shipped to France to make their public debut at the Paris Salon. Barnard's sculpture groups were given the place of honor at the 1910 Salon de Champ de Mars at the Gran Palais in Paris. =Nudity controversy= Barnard's vision of twin sculpture groups of profuse nude figures was controversial from the start.Robert Swift, \\"The Price of Prudity in 1911,\\" The Political Express, September 25, 2011. Each group was composed of 8 individual sculptures featuring 1 to 4 figures.George Grey Barnard, from Pennsylvania Capitol Preservation Committee. Of the 30 total figures, 27 were nude--the angel was gowned, and both infants were swaddled in cloth. Some Pennsylvania legislators and local religious leaders opposed the nudity of Barnard's sculptures. He responded: The Prodigal Son (modeled 1904), Speed Museum > There has been some criticism, because these 30 figures I have executed are > nude. Only in the nude could I have given adequate expression to these > figures. Drapery would have spoiled the effect. Only through delineation of > the nude human form can great emotions be shown. You cannot drape a symbolic > figure in an overcoat and expect it to be anything but a marble dummy. > It is curious that this criticism should come from men, while women approve > of the work as is. Women have better artistic sense than men. They are > inspired by the human form, but men are not similarly inspired. They think > the nude suggestive. I understand that the Pennsylvania state authorities > are going to drape them. I shall make no protest, but I am sorry.\\"Defends > Nude in Statuary,\\" The Alexandria Gazette, April 25, 1911, p. 1. Initially, plaster of Paris short trousers were applied to the male figures, but the results proved unsatisfactory. Two tents were erected on Friday, May 12, one around each sculpture group, to mask that day's removal of the plaster trousers. On Sunday, the canvas walls of the tents were cut down by art-lovers who wished to view the sculptures before plaster loincloths were applied on Monday--\\"the great majority of the crowd being women,\\" according to The Chicago Tribune.\\"Women in Fight to See Nude Art,\\" The Chicago Tribune, May 15, 1911, p. 2. Instead of short trousers or loincloths, the Piccirilli Brothers carved marble sheaths to cover the genitals of the male figures, for which they charged $118.50. =1911 dedication= The sculptures were installed by Giulio Piccirilli.

The current building is the result of successive reconstructions, transformations and additions. Thus, the oldest element preserved is the apse which, by its structure, does not appear before the 13th century, following a type very similar to that of the Cristo de la Vega, in which the exterior stands out, and the straight section, which precedes the apse proper. It also coincides with that date the use of friezes in the corner, separating horizontally the bodies of arches, and the same typology of arches, which repeats the folded half-points and the horseshoe pointed, covered by lobed, appearing in the Legend of Cristo de la Vega. The whole was disfigured by adding, on the axis, a large Baroque shield and opening two spans, for illumination of the main chapel and a crypt. In the interior it conserves the double archery that runs the perimeter of the apse, simple blind arches of horseshoe. To the right, taking advantage of the thickness of the wall, has incorporated a small Gothic chapel, with vault of crossery, of beginnings of the 14th century. Once the parish was abolished in 1842, the building now houses the Circle, part of the Toledo Museum of Art.

Third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce substantially longer reads than second generation sequencing. Such an advantage has critical implications for both genome science and the study of biology in general. However, third generation sequencing data have much higher error rates than previous technologies, which can complicate downstream genome assembly and analysis of the resulting data. These technologies are undergoing active development and it is expected that there will be improvements to the high error rates. For applications that are more tolerant to error rates, such as structural variant calling, third generation sequencing has been found to outperform existing methods.  Current technologies  Sequencing technologies with a different approach than second-generation platforms were first described as \\"third-generation\\" in 2008-2009. There are several companies currently at the heart of third generation sequencing technology development, namely, Pacific Biosciences, Oxford Nanopore Technology, Quantapore (CA-USA), and Stratos (WA-USA). These companies are taking fundamentally different approaches to sequencing single DNA molecules. PacBio developed the sequencing platform of single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT), based on the properties of zero-mode waveguides. Signals are in the form of fluorescent light emission from each nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase bound to the bottom of the zL well. Oxford Nanopore‚Äôs technology involves passing a DNA molecule through a nanoscale pore structure and then measuring changes in electrical field surrounding the pore; while Quantapore has a different proprietary nanopore approach. Stratos Genomics spaces out the DNA bases with polymeric inserts, \\"Xpandomers\\", to circumvent the signal to noise challenge of nanopore ssDNA reading. Also notable is Helicos's single molecule fluorescence approach, but the company entered bankruptcy in the fall of 2015.  Advantages  = Longer reads = In comparison to the current generation of sequencing technologies, third generation sequencing has the obvious advantage of producing much longer reads. It is expected that these longer read lengths will alleviate numerous computational challenges surrounding genome assembly, transcript reconstruction, and metagenomics among other important areas of modern biology and medicine. It is well known that eukaryotic genomes including primates and humans are complex and have large numbers of long repeated regions. Short reads from second generation sequencing must resort to approximative strategies in order to infer sequences over long ranges for assembly and genetic variant calling. Pair end reads have been leveraged by second generation sequencing to combat these limitations. However, exact fragment lengths of pair ends are often unknown and must also be approximated as well. By making long reads lengths possible, third generation sequencing technologies have clear advantages. = Epigenetics = Epigenetic markers are stable and potentially heritable modifications to the DNA molecule that are not in its sequence. An example is DNA methylation at CpG sites, which has been found to influence gene expression. Histone modifications are another example. The current generation of sequencing technologies rely on laboratory techniques such as ChIP-sequencing for the detection of epigenetic markers. These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four nucleotide bases. = Portability and speed = MinION Portable Gene Sequencer, Oxford Nanopore Technologies Other important advantages of third generation sequencing technologies include portability and sequencing speed. Since minimal sample preprocessing is required in comparison to second generation sequencing, smaller equipments could be designed. Oxford Nanopore Technology has recently commercialized the MinION sequencer. This sequencing machine is roughly the size of a regular USB flash drive and can be used readily by connecting to a laptop. In addition, since the sequencing process is not parallelized across regions of the genome, data could be collected and analyzed in real time. These advantages of third generation sequencing may be well-suited in hospital settings where quick and on-site data collection and analysis is demanded.  Challenges  Third generation sequencing, as it currently stands, faces important challenges mainly surrounding accurate identification of nucleotide bases; error rates are still much higher compared to second generation sequencing. This is generally due to instability of the molecular machinery involved. For example, in PacBio‚Äôs single molecular and real time sequencing technology, the DNA polymerase molecule becomes increasingly damaged as the sequencing process occurs. Additionally, since the process happens quickly, the signals given off by individual bases may be blurred by signals from neighbouring bases. This poses a new computational challenge for deciphering the signals and consequently inferring the sequence. Methods such as Hidden Markov Models, for example, have been leveraged for this purpose with some success. On average, different individuals of the human population share about 99.9% of their genes. In other words, approximately only one out of every thousand bases would differ between any two person. The high error rates involved with third generation sequencing are inevitably problematic for the purpose of characterizing individual differences that exist between members of the same species.  Genome assembly  Genome assembly is the reconstruction of whole genome DNA sequences. This is generally done with two fundamentally different approaches. = Reference alignment = When a reference genome is available, as one is in the case of human, newly sequenced reads could simply be aligned to the reference genome in order to characterize its properties. Such reference based assembly is quick and easy but has the disadvantage of ‚Äúhiding\\" novel sequences and large copy number variants. In addition, reference genomes do not yet exist for most organisms. = De novo assembly = De novo assembly is the alternative genome assembly approach to reference alignment. It refers to the reconstruction of whole genome sequences entirely from raw sequence reads. This method would be chosen when there is no reference genome, when the species of the given organism is unknown as in metagenomics, or when there exist genetic variants of interest that may not be detected by reference genome alignment. Given the short reads produced by the current generation of sequencing technologies, de novo assembly is a major computational problem. It is normally approached by an iterative process of finding and connecting sequence reads with sensible overlaps. Various computational and statistical techniques, such as de bruijn graphs and overlap layout consensus graphs, have been leveraged to solve this problem. Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. Pair end reads have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated. Hybrid assembly - the use of reads from 3rd gen sequencing platforms with shorts reads from 2nd gen platforms - may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. Short second generation reads have also been used to correct errors that exist in the long third generation reads. = Hybrid assembly = Long read lengths offered by third generation sequencing may alleviate many of the challenges currently faced by de novo genome assemblies. For example, if an entire repetitive region can be sequenced unambiguously in a single read, no computation inference would be required. Computational methods have been proposed to alleviate the issue of high error rates. For example, in one study, it was demonstrated that de novo assembly of a microbial genome using PacBio sequencing alone performed superior to that of second generation sequencing. Third generation sequencing may also be used in conjunction with second generation sequencing. This approach is often referred to as hybrid sequencing. For example, long reads from third generation sequencing may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. On the other hand, short second generation reads have been used to correct errors in that exist in the long third generation reads. In general, this hybrid approach has been shown to improve de novo genome assemblies significantly.  Epigenetic markers  DNA methylation (DNAm) ‚Äì the covalent modification of DNA at CpG sites resulting in attached methyl groups ‚Äì is the best understood component of epigenetic machinery. DNA modifications and resulting gene expression can vary across cell types, temporal development, with genetic ancestry, can change due to environmental stimuli and are heritable. After the discovery of DNAm, researchers have also found its correlation to diseases like cancer and autism. In this disease etiology context DNAm is an important avenue of further research. = Advantages = The current most common methods for examining methylation state require an assay that fragments DNA before standard second generation sequencing on the Illumina platform. As a result of short read length, information regarding the longer patterns of methylation are lost. Third generation sequencing technologies offer the capability for single molecule real-time sequencing of longer reads, and detection of DNA modification without the aforementioned assay. PacBio SMRT technology and Oxford Nanopore can use unaltered DNA to detect methylation. Oxford Nanopore Technologies‚Äô MinION has been used to detect DNAm. As each DNA strand passes through a pore, it produces electrical signals which have been found to be sensitive to epigenetic changes in the nucleotides, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to analyze MinION data to detect 5-methylcytosine (5mC) DNA modification. The model was trained using synthetically methylated E. coli DNA and the resulting signals measured by the nanopore technology. Then the trained model was used to detect 5mC in MinION genomic reads from a human cell line which already had a reference methylome. The classifier has 82% accuracy in randomly sampled singleton sites, which increases to 95% when more stringent thresholds are applied. Other methods address different types of DNA modifications using the MinION platform. Stoiber et al. examined 4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA), along with 5mC, and also created a software to directly visualize the raw MinION data in human-friendly way. Here they found that in E. coli, which has a known methylome, event windows of 5 base pairs long can be used to divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals. A straightforward Mann-Whitney U test can detect modified portions of the E. coli sequence, as well as further split the modifications into 4mC, 6mA or 5mC regions. It seems likely that in the future, MinION raw data will be used to detect many different epigenetic marks in DNA. PacBio sequencing has also been used to detect DNA methylation. In this platform the pulse width - the width of a fluorescent light pulse - corresponds to a specific base. In 2010 it was shown that the interpulse distance in control and methylated samples are different, and there is a \\"signature\\" pulse width for each methylation type. In 2012 using the PacBio platform the binding sites of DNA methyltransferases were characterized. The detection of N6-methylation in C Elegans was shown in 2015. DNA methylation on N6-adenine using the PacBio platform in mouse embryonic stem cells was shown in 2016. Other forms of DNA modifications ‚Äì from heavy metals, oxidation, or UV damage ‚Äì are also possible avenues of research using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio third generation sequencing. = Drawbacks = Processing of the raw data ‚Äì such as normalization to the median signal ‚Äì was needed on MinION raw data, reducing real-time capability of the technology. Consistency of the electrical signals is still an issue, making it difficult to accurately call a nucleotide. MinION has low throughput; since multiple overlapping reads are hard to obtain, this further leads to accuracy problems of downstream DNA modification detection. Both the hidden Markov model and statistical methods used with MinION raw data require repeated observations of DNA modifications for detection, meaning that individual modified nucleotides need to be consistently present in multiple copies of the genome, e.g. in multiple cells or plasmids in the sample. For the PacBio platform, too, depending on what methylation you expect to find, coverage needs can vary. As of March 2017, other epigenetic factors like histone modifications have not been discoverable using third-generation technologies. Longer patterns of methylation are often lost because smaller contigs still need to be assembled.  Transcriptomics  Transcriptomics is the study of the transcriptome, usually by characterizing the relative abundances of messenger RNA molecules the tissue under study. According to the central dogma of molecular biology, genetic information flows from double stranded DNA molecules to single stranded mRNA molecules where they can be readily translated into function protein molecules. By studying the transcriptome, one can gain valuable insight into the regulation of gene expressions. While expression levels as the gene level can be more or less accurately depicted by second generation sequencing, transcript level information is still an important challenge. As a consequence, the role of alternative splicing in molecular biology remains largely elusive. Third generation sequencing technologies hold promising prospects in resolving this issue by enabling sequencing of mRNA molecules at their full lengths. = Alternative splicing = Alternative splicing (AS) is the process by which a single gene may give rise to multiple distinct mRNA transcripts and consequently different protein translations. Some evidence suggests that AS is a ubiquitous phenomenon and may play a key role in determining the phenotypes of organisms, especially in complex eukaryotes; all eukaryotes contain genes consisting of introns that may undergo AS. In particular, it has been estimated that AS occurs in 95% of all human multi-exon genes. AS has undeniable potential to influence myriad biological processes. Advancing knowledge in this area has critical implications for the study of biology in general. = Transcript reconstruction = The current generation of sequencing technologies produce only short reads, putting tremendous limitation on the ability to detect distinct transcripts; short reads must be reverse engineered into original transcripts that could have given rise to the resulting read observations. This task is further complicated by the highly variable expression levels across transcripts, and consequently variable read coverages across the sequence of the gene. In addition, exons may be shared among individual transcripts, rendering unambiguous inferences essentially impossible. Existing computational methods make inferences based on the accumulation of short reads at various sequence locations often by making simplifying assumptions. Cufflinks takes a parsimonious approach, seeking to explain all the reads with the fewest possible number of transcripts. On the other hand, StringTie attempts to simultaneously estimate transcript abundances while assembling the reads. These methods, while reasonable, may not always identify real transcripts. A study published in 2008 surveyed 25 different existing transcript reconstruction protocols. Its evidence suggested that existing methods are generally weak in assembling transcripts, though the ability to detect individual exons are relatively intact. According to the estimates, average sensitivity to detect exons across the 25 protocols is 80% for Caenorhabditis elegans genes. In comparison, transcript identification sensitivity decreases to 65%. For human, the study reported an exon detection sensitivity averaging to 69% and transcript detection sensitivity had an average of mere 33%. In other words, for human, existing methods are able to identify less than half of all existing transcript. Third generation sequencing technologies have demonstrated promising prospects in solving the problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation at the level of transcripts. While error rates remain high, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce much longer read lengths. Pacific Bioscience has introduced the iso-seq platform, proposing to sequence mRNA molecules at their full lengths. It is anticipated that Oxford Nanopore will put forth similar technologies. The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads. This approach has been previously tested and reported to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds.  Metagenomics  Metagenomics is the analysis of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. = Advantages = The main advantage for third-generation sequencing technologies in metagenomics is their speed of sequencing in comparison to second generation techniques. Speed of sequencing is important for example in the clinical setting (i.e. pathogen identification), to allow for efficient diagnosis and timely clinical actions. Oxford Nanopore's MinION was used in 2015 for real-time metagenomic detection of pathogens in complex, high-background clinical samples. The first Ebola virus (EBV) read was sequenced 44 seconds after data acquisition. There was uniform mapping of reads to genome; at least one read mapped to >88% of the genome. The relatively long reads allowed for sequencing of a near-complete viral genome to high accuracy (97‚Äì99% identity) directly from a primary clinical sample. A common phylogenetic marker for microbial community diversity studies is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Both MinION and PacBio's SMRT platform have been used to sequence this gene. In this context the PacBio error rate was comparable to that of shorter reads from 454 and Illumina's MiSeq sequencing platforms. = Drawbacks = MinION's high error rate (~10-40%) prevented identification of antimicrobial resistance markers, for which single nucleotide resolution is necessary. For the same reason, eukaryotic pathogens were not identified. Ease of carryover contamination when re-using the same flow cell (standard wash protocols don‚Äôt work) is also a concern. Unique barcodes may allow for more multiplexing. Furthermore, performing accurate species identification for bacteria, fungi and parasites is very difficult, as they share a larger portion of the genome, and some only differ by <5%. The per base sequencing cost is still significantly more than that of MiSeq. However, the prospect of supplementing reference databases with full-length sequences from organisms below the limit of detection from the Sanger approach; this could possibly greatly help the identification of organisms in metagenomics.

Museum Curation =At the Penn Museum= Middle East Galleries: Journey to the City (2017‚Äìpresent) Holly Pittman worked with a team of 10 curators and 16 conservators to create the Penn Museum's new permanent Middle East Galleries. It took three years to curate this large exhibit which spans 7,000 years of human history, from the earliest cities to today's modern metropolises. Pittman went on record stating that one of her favorite objects in the gallery is a translucent obsidian bowl which demonstrates remarkable craftsmanship. She remarked that ‚ÄúThrough these galleries we are trying to tell the story of humanity, of people who were not so different from you or me.‚Äù Iraq's Ancient Past: Discoveries from the Ur's Royal Cemetery (2009‚Äì2017) Incorporating many of the same artifacts as \\"Treasures from the Royal Tombs of Ur\\", Pittman and co-curator Richard L. Zettler reinterpreted the excavations at Ur in the special exhibit ‚ÄúIraq‚Äôs Ancient Past: Discoveries from the Ur‚Äôs Royal Cemetery‚Äù. Like the exhibit's previous iteration, it includes several objects which the art critic and former Metropolitan Museum of Art Director Thomas Hoving called ‚Äúthe finest, most resplendent and magical works of art in all of America.‚Äù In addition, the exhibit brings together the ancient past and the present by exploring pressing issues of preserving Iraq's cultural heritage during the country's ongoing military conflicts. Treasures from the Royal Tombs of Ur (Traveling Exhibit) (1993‚Äì2003) Together with Penn Museum curator Richard L. Zettler, Pittman curated this traveling exhibit which displayed more than 200 ancient Sumerian artifacts from the city of Ur. These objects, many of which are now on display in the Penn Museum's permanent Middle East Galleries, include the so-called ‚ÄúRam in a Thicket‚Äù, and Queen Puabi‚Äôs elaborate headdress. The artifacts visited eight cities, including Chicago, Illinois and Knoxville, Tennessee, before returning to the Penn Museum in 2001. =At the Metropolitan Museum of Art=  Ancient Art in Miniature: Exhibition of Cylinder and Stamp seals in the collection of Martin Cherkasky (1987)  Pittman curated this exhibit following the Met‚Äôs acquisition of 250 stamp and cylinder seals from donors Martin and Sarah Cherkasky. The exhibit, which included both the recently donated seals and a selection from the Met‚Äôs permanent collection, highlighted the importance of stamp and cylinder seals in the study of the art and archaeology of the ancient Near East. The use of stamp seals preceded writing in Near Eastern society, and they were the major form of seal used beginning in 6th century BC. Assyrian Relief Galleries (1979) Working with co-curators Vaughn Crawford and Prudence Harper, Pittman curated this exhibit as the first stage in the reinstallation of the Met's permanent Ancient Near Eastern Art galleries. This gallery includes the Assyrian relief sculptures from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II. Notably, they are positioned as they would have been displayed in his palace in Nimrud. Ancient Near East Galleries (1978) Working with a team of several co-curators, Pittman reimagined the display of the Met‚Äôs Ancient Near Eastern art collection after retrieving them from storage following the construction of the Lila Acheson Wallace Galleries of Egyptian Art. Scythian Treasures from the Hermitage (1975) As an assistant for her first curatorial efforts, Pittman helped curate this exhibit which displayed renowned Scythian gold objects as well as important bronze, wood, leather, and felt artworks.

The film follows the positive and negative impacts of travel and tourism on numerous communities across the globe, including Thailand, Bolivia, Mali (Timbuktu) and Bhutan, documenting how communities thrive, adapt, or deteriorate in the face of mass tourism, \\"one of the most powerful globalizing forces of our time.\\" Yossi Ghinsberg The film features Israeli adventurer and author, Yossi Ghinsberg, who, in 1981, survived for three weeks after being stranded in the Bolivian jungle. In Gringo Trails, Ghinsberg returns to the jungle and the community who assisted in his rescue, and discusses how they have adapted to the influx of tourism in the wake of his own survival story, and assists them in the development of their own ecolodge, Chalalan. Ghinsberg's story is the subject of Jungle (2017 film), a survival thriller film directed by Greg McLean and starring Daniel Radcliffe in the role of Ghinsberg. Costas Christ The film also features Costas Christ, editor-at-large and award-winning travel writer for National Geographic. In the film, Christ, a proponent of sustainable tourism, discusses his relationship with the island community of Ko Pha Ngan in southern Thailand, which he inadvertently popularised as a tourist destination after discovering its relatively untouched beauty in the late 1970s. Christ cites the mass ecological damage which has befallen the island since the 1980s in the wake of the escalating popularity of the island's now notorious Full Moon Party with international tourists and backpackers, held monthly on the island's Haad Rin beach. Reviews On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 71% based on seven reviews, with an average rating of 7.42/10. Film publications such as The Hollywood Reporter, and Film Journal International were amongst those to praise both the quality of the film and its central thesis. The film also generated a lot of positive press among numerous international travel publications, such as Travel Weekly, National Geographic Traveler, Cond√© Nast Traveler, and Outside Magazine, the latter of which described the documentary as \\"an important and moving film.\\" References Further reading * \\"'Gringo Trails': Film Review\\".

It typically causes restricted movement of the forearm, in particular rotation (pronation and supination), though is not usually painful unless it causes subluxation of the radial head. It can be associated with dislocation of the radial head which leads to limited elbow extension.

Although ambitions existed to extend the line through to Stranraer it was built on a site that would not permit this and so when the line was built the Girvan New station was opened on 5 October 1877 by the Girvan and Portpatrick Junction Railway on the route to Pinmore and eventually through to Stranraer railway station.  History  Girvan goods station in 1985. The original Girvan terminus station was situated adjacent to the goods station that was established at the site. It was opened by the Maybole and Girvan Railway with only one short platform in 1860 and was retained as a goods station in 1877 by the Glasgow and South Western Railway who took over the running of the line to Stranraer. The Girvan New station was further from the town and this was not popular with passengers and it appears that trains called at either station for a short period of time. Girvan Old Station closed to regular passenger traffic on 1 April 1893 and the goods station remained in use. Another source states that Girvan New station at first only catered for the workings continuing south to Stranraer. The remnants of the old station platform were still present in 1988 and were even visible in 2017 many years after the track was lifted. Station and goods station infrastructure One of the old weighbridges. Girvan Old had a single platform. The goods station had a number of buildings including a turntable, water column, weighing machines, engine shed that closed in 1940 and a coal yard with a bridge over the River Girvan that led to the harbour and jetty. The track was still in situ in 1989 however it had been lifted by 2014. The old Girvan terminus went out of use in the 1980s due to the poor condition of the wooden bridge over the River Girvan although ballast trains were still making use of the site. Harbour branch The Glasgow and South-Western Railway built a line to the harbour from the goods station that involved a second bridge over the River Girvan and at the harbour jetty coal was emptied down a chute into waiting colliers that took the coal to Ireland. A network of sidings and two waggon turntables existed here. This arrangement only lasted until 1918 with coal coming from the Bargany Pit.  References  = Notes = = Sources = * Butt, R. V. J. (1995).

Founder of the NGO Red Thread anti-violence campaigns, she has been involved in training programmes of judicial officers and contributed to the drafting law to protect trafficking and anti-violence. Her advocacy has been recognized by both regional and international organizations. Early life Karen Audrey de Souza was born on 19 January 1958 in Georgetown, the capital city of British Guiana, to Mary-Anne and Dennis Adrian de Souza. Her mother maintained the home and worked as needed as a seamstress or examination invigilator. Her father was a wharf supervisor. De Souza identifies as Afro-Guyanese, though her heritage includes Amerindian, Chinese, Dutch, East Indian, Portuguese, and Scottish ancestry, as well. Much of her childhood was spent on Leguan Island. After completing her primary schooling in 1968, de Souza was awarded a scholarship to attend Bishops' High School in Georgetown, graduating in 1974. Career De Souza began her career in the offices of then Prime Minister Forbes Burnham, as a library assistant in 1974. The following year, she began working as a volunteer in the Guyana National Service (GNS), an organization that provided basic training and skills for unemployed youth. She learned electrical skills in the service and gave reading courses to illiterates. She pursued studies at the University of Guyana between 1976 and 1977 while continuing her employment in the library, and became active in promoting the film The Terror and the Time, a documentary on British colonialism. She distributed political flyers, which resulted in a reprimand from her employer. In 1979, after an investigation into whether Working People's Alliance members had involvement with a recent arson, her home was searched and she was charged with larceny for some material found concerning the GNS. De Souza had not previously been involved with the Alliance, but after her detainment, she joined the group, identified as a Marxist and became a political activist. Graduating with her bachelor of arts degree in 1980, de Souza continued her political activities, working in opposition to the government of her employer. Though the larceny charge was dismissed in 1985, after a lengthy battle to clear her name, she was fired from her job and became a full-time activist. As her employment opportunities had been limited by the accusations and subsequent arrests, at times, she had to rely on family for support. The following year, she and other women involved with the Working People's Alliance (WPA) co-founded Red Thread, as a grass-roots activist organization to assist rural communities and women in the Afro-Guyanese, Amerindian and Indo-Guyanese populations. Initially their efforts focused on education and political rights, but in 1993, de Souza disaffiliated with the WPA, becoming a full-time coordinator for Red Thread. De Souza has done research on prostitution and sex work in Guyana, as well as participated in conferences on critical geography to evaluate how location intersects with socio-political factors, such as class, ethnicity, gender, nationality, race and sexuality. She has led Red Thread's focus away from political power and toward self-advocacy. De Souza was the driving force behind the creation of a domestic violence survivors' group for women to tell their experiences, help each other and learn from one another. Since 2000, her efforts have focused on poverty, children's rights, and domestic violence. To assist women's comprehension of their protections under the law, she rewrote the Domestic Violence Act into a booklet in language that is easily understood. She coordinates efforts with the judiciary and the Guyana Police Force to educate and understand the complex issues surrounding domestic violence, building bridges for quick action when situations arise. De Souza was Guyana's nominee for the International Women of Courage Award in 2012. In 2014, de Souza was awarded the Anthony N Sabga Caribbean Award for Excellence in the field of community service.

The landing was part of the broader Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, an undeclared war fought between Malaysia and Indonesia during the early 1960s over the creation of an independent Malaysian Federation. The conflict chiefly encompassed parts of northern Borneo, areas that Indonesia sought control in her bid to increase her power and influence in Southeast Asia; however, the landing represented a shift of the operational sphere toward the mainland. The landing was part of an extended campaign of similar incursions into Malaysian territory in late 1964 launched by Indonesian President Sukarno to substantiate an aggressively nationalistic speech delivered on 17 August of that year and to establish a base for a potential Communist rebellion. A first landing was dispatched that very night to the Pontian District of Johore, but was quickly halted by Commonwealth security forces. The operation at Kesang River was the sixth attempt at seaborne infiltration. During the night of 29 October, two groups were landed, one on each side of the river. As with all previous attempts, civilians reported the raiders to local police; soon, Commonwealth troops quickly swept the area and captured nearly all of the Indonesian party. Kesang River was not the last attempt by Indonesian forces to establish a foothold in the Malayan wilderness, but continual Allied capture of the raiders began to lessen the security and diplomatic ramifications of such efforts so as to make them far less effective. However, the effort is notable for being the first occasion on which Australian troops fought against their Indonesian neighbors, a development that was the subject of controversy in both nations and helped to escalate tensions between them.  Origins  During the celebrations of Indonesia's independence from the Netherlands on 17 August 1964, President of Indonesia Sukarno declared that the year to come would be a 'Year of Dangerous Living.' This was meant to signal his intent upon intensifying the ongoing Confrontation by expanding the conflict to mainland Malaysia, a risky move that might provoke a major British response. Sukarno meant to follow through with his statement immediately, and had planned to launch a series of airborne and seaborne attacks by Indonesian 'volunteers' on the Malay peninsula. Though this was a potentially dangerous effort, as it took the war out of its containment in Borneo, it had a chance of capitalizing upon recent unrest in Malaya and Singapore by putting Indonesian soldiers and sympathizers inside Malaysian territory, where they could attempt to raise the populace against a new and unpopular government.Easter 2012, p. 98. The first landing was made at Pontian on the night of Sukarno's speech, and subsequent operations were attempted at Labis, Malacca, Panchor, and Pontian again throughout the fall. The next landing was set for the night of 29 October, in the jungles surrounding the Kesang River.Pfenningworth 2008, p. 207.  Landings  In the night of 29 October, 52 Indonesian volunteers sailed across the Straits of Malacca in commandeered fishing vessels, and landed on each side of the western mouth of the Kesang River. Their objective was to avoid being sighted initially by Malaysian security forces and slip quietly into the swampland, where they would attempt to blend in with the populace, begin sowing the seeds of rebellion, and launch guerrilla raids against Malaysian infrastructure. However, Malaysian fishermen spotted the raiders in the process of landing, and quickly informed the police. British troops of General Terence McMeekin's 28th Commonwealth Brigade were immediately directed to the scene, where they swept the region and killed or captured all but two of the invaders, who managed to fade into the wilderness. The remainder were swiftly shipped off to internment locations.United States Naval Institute 1969, p. 165. The British were assisted by Australian troops of the Royal Australian Regiment's 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce McDonald, who had also received similar tip-offs and assisted in the rout of the Indonesian force.Tink 2014, p. 227.  Aftermath  Though the Landing at Kesang River was a failure for Indonesia, with none of the mission's objectives being completed, this did not deter them from future raiding attempts. One raid was attempted on the east coast of Johore at Kuala Sedili on 15 November, before the operation returned to the west once more with landings at Semarah and Kuala Buntu in December.Cheng Leng & Eng Lee 2016 Anglo-Malaysian naval forces intercepted several seaborne raids in December and January, before the raiding began to die down in the early part of 1965, relieving British planners of the need to make retaliatory strikes against Indonesian bases, which would have escalated the conflict yet further in a tense period. The greatest effects of the raid were, in fact, felt in Australia, who had committed troops to a combat action for the first time. Prime Minister Robert Menzies solemnly announced that Australians had gone into battle in Parliament the following day, to widespread reaction in both Indonesia and Australia. At home, some feared that the two nations were on the 'road to war,' while in Indonesia Foreign Minister Subandrio arraigned the Australian move, stating that his nation 'would not be bullied,' and the press ratified his statement. The controversy was further compounded by Menzies's announcement of conscription on 10 November, which triggered anti-conscription rallies and incited more of the wrath the Indonesian media. In order to turn the tide of the conflict away from mainland Malaysia, the Australian government reluctantly acceded to British pressure and landed a battalion in Borneo, which saw numerous combat action in defending and leading raids over the Indonesian border.Tink 2014, pp. 227‚Äì8.

Maine Question 2 sought to expand Medicaid eligibility under the terms of the Affordable Care Act. The measure passed. Background Expanded eligibility for the Medicaid program, called MaineCare in Maine, was a provision of the Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. The expansion was originally required of states as a condition of all federal Medicaid funding, but the United States Supreme Court ruled in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that such expansion was optional for states. Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage criticized the eligibility requirements for MaineCare, feeling that it was too easy to qualify for as it existed when he took office in 2010.MPBN. Retrieved October 28, 2010 He was a staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act, believing that it violated the Constitution and took freedoms from citizens. LePage vetoed six efforts to expand MaineCare eligibility. On one occasion, LePage described efforts by the Maine Legislature to write an expansion bill that would garner bipartisan support as having \\"no compassion\\". Supporters of expansion, led by Maine Equal Justice Partners, announced on October 12, 2016 that they intended to launch a petition drive to put the issue to the voters. LePage's spokesperson criticized the effort as \\"another attempt by liberals to pass welfare expansion\\". Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap announced on February 21, 2017 that supporters of the measure had submitted over 66,000 verified signatures, far above the 61,123 required to place a measure on the ballot. The question that appeared on petition forms was: \\"Do you want Maine to provide health insurance through Medicaid for qualified adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line?\\" During the comment period before the question's wording was finalized, several Republican legislators disputed the inclusion of the word \\"insurance\\" in the question, arguing that MaineCare benefits are not insurance, but welfare benefits. Those legislators opined that the question did not meet the Maine Constitution's requirement that referendum questions be \\"simple, clear, concise, and direct\\". They further noted that the word \\"insurance\\" did not appear in the proposed referendum itself. Supporters defended the use of the word \\"insurance\\" on the grounds that MaineCare does not provide cash to recipients, but directly pays providers of medical services. At the end of the comment period, Secretary Dunlap announced that the final wording of the question would replace the word \\"insurance\\" with \\"coverage\\". Representatives of both sides of the issue announced their support of the decision. The ballot question read as follows: \\"Do you want Maine to expand Medicaid to provide healthcare coverage for qualified adults under age 65 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 means $16,643 for a single person and $22,412 for a family of two?\\"https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/citizensguide2017.pdf Campaign =Endorsements= Supporters =Individuals= * Janet Mills, Maine Attorney General * George J.

LePage stated that he would not implement the Medicaid expansion required by Maine Question 2 unless the Legislature funded it without a tax increase and without using money from the state Rainy Day Fund. Medicaid expansion became an issue in the 2018 elections. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Janet Mills stated she would implement the law, and Republican Shawn Moody stated he would continue LePage's refusal to do so. Supporters of expansion sued the LePage administration on April 30, 2018 to force the expansion to be implemented. On June 4, 2018, Judge Michaela Murphy ruled that Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Ricker Hamilton must submit a plan for expansion by June 11 to allow MaineCare to start accepting newly eligible applicants on July 2, 2018. LePage said that he would rather go to jail than implement the expansion without a funding mechanism that met his criteria. LePage's successor, Democrat Janet Mills, signed an order implementing the referendum as one of her first acts, enabling signups to begin immediately.

It has been suggested that Jawad was the terrorist wearing the ski mask featured in images that became iconic of this atrocity. Early life Khalid had grown up in the Chatila refugee camp in Lebanon with several other of his fellow fedayeen, even playing on the same football team as some of them and was described as 'soccer mad'. Khalid had lived in West Germany for two years with his brother Farud but was sent home because \\"he couldn't fit in\\". Jawad was recruited for the Munich operation thereafter. Preparation for the Attack at the Munich Olympics Upon being chosen for the Munich operation Khalid undertook training. Khalid told his brother that he was \\"going to play football in Syria.\\" On his return however, his family noticed marks on his back as if he'd been wearing a backpack. When asked about where he had been, Khalid persisted in telling them that he had been playing football, but instructed them, not to \\"tell anyone.\\" A couple of weeks later and a month before the start of the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, Khalid and the other chosen fedayeen flew to Tripoli to undertake a months advanced training in Libya. Death at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base Upon arriving in one of the two helicopters with his fellow fedayeen and the Israeli athletes at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, the fedayeen became embroiled in a firefight with five German police marksmen positioned around the airfield who fired upon the fedayeen. During the firefight, Khalid made a dash across the pitch black airfield away from the back of the helicopters and ran unwittingly straight towards a low signal garden where a German police marksman was positioned behind, lying prone on the ground. The marksman fired several shots from a distance of five metres, hitting Jawad in the face and shooting him a further three times as he was falling. Jawad was not killed instantly however, the marksman reported hearing the terrorist 'moaning and gasping for breath several times', while helicopter pilot Gunnar Ebel, who had sought cover next to the prone marksmen during the opening stage of the gun battle, reported hearing a 'gurgling' sound, from Jawad as he died. Aftermath Khalid's family only found out about his death after a photograph in a local newspaper showed Khalid's corpse with a bullet through his face. His body and those of his four fedayeen compatriots were handed over to Libya and after a procession of 30,000 people from Tripoli's Martyrs' Square, were buried in the Sidi Munaidess Cemetery.

In this position, he was frequently a fund raiser for Methodist Colleges, particularly Rust University, Morgan College, and Philander Smith College. Among his closest benefactors was James N. Gamble (son of James Gamble of Procter & Gamble). In the mid 1910s, Penn took part in a movement for unification of Methodist churches in America which sought to mend the rift between North and South Churches largely due to slavery. Penn and Robert E. Jones were the leading African American members of the Joint Commission on Unification of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, the episode was directed by Guillem Morales and was first shown on 21 March 2017, on BBC Two. It stars Pemberton, Shearsmith, Fiona Shaw, Montserrat Lombard, Morgana Robinson, Felicity Kendal, Johnny Flynn, and Muriel Gray. The comedian Peter Kay makes a cameo appearance, with his character being killed in the episode's opening seconds. The episode follows a number of people at the launch of Fragments, a retrospective exhibition featuring the work of the late sculptor Elliot Quinn. A projection of Quinn welcomes the motley assortment of guests, who have, the projection claims, been hand-picked for the occasion. Shortly after their arrival, they realise they are trapped in the basement gallery, and are being killed one-by-one. The episode lampoons pretentiousness in the contemporary art world, and pays homage to Agatha Christie's 1939 novel And Then There Were None and classic horror films, including Theatre of Blood. \\"Private View\\" received critical acclaim, with many characterising it as a strong end to a strong series. Critics noted that the episode was both funny and horrific, featuring toilet humour and gore horror, and the cast was praised. Multiple critics noted that they found the episode's final seconds unclear, but the journalist Rachel Cooke said that such \\"unlooked-for moments when nothing quite makes sense\\", serve only to \\"emphasise [Inside No. 9] surpassing brilliance\\". Production The comedian Peter Kay (2012) made a surprise cameo appearance in \\"Private View\\". The third series of Inside No. 9 was announced in October 2015, with filming beginning in January 2016, at which time Fiona Shaw, Montserrat Lombard, and Morgana Robinson were named as guest stars in the series. \\"Private View\\" was the sixth and final episode of the series, which began with the December 2016 Christmas special \\"The Devil of Christmas\\" and continued through February and March 2017 with the following five episodes. \\"Private View\\" first aired on 21 March, on BBC Two. The episode, which was written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton and directed by Guillem Morales, starred Robinson as Carrie, Lombard as Bea, Shearsmith as Maurice, Shaw as Jean, Pemberton as Kenneth, Felicity Kendal as Patricia, Johnny Flynn as Elliot Quinn, and Muriel Gray as a reporter. In an interview, Kendal expressed her admiration of Pemberton and Shearsmith, and said how much she had enjoyed the filming process. The comedian Peter Kay made a cameo appearance, which was deliberately kept out of promotional material about the episode; a number of critics noted the appearance of a guest star that they would not mention. However, Kay had been mentioned in connection with the episode by Pemberton in a December 2016 Empire interview, along with Shaw and Kendal. The setting was a \\"designer's nightmare\\", according to Pemberton, as it required the creation of a number of pieces of original art. The production team included a large number of mannequins, which Pemberton identified as an indication that \\"something bad is going to happen\\". The episode was filmed \\"in a basement warehouse, sort of underground car park\\". Plot Neil, a nurse present to assist a visually impaired person, is pushed onto a chair with blades by an unseen assailant, where he bleeds to death. Carrie, a fame-obsessed former Big Brother contestant, exits a lift to Fragments, a retrospective exhibition of the sculptor Elliot Quinn held in an East London basement gallery. The sarcastic, tattooed Bea serves drinks. Maurice, an academic art critic, the humourless council health-and-safety worker Kenneth Williams‚Äîwho has never seen any of the Carry On films starring his namesake‚Äîand the Irish dinner lady Jean follow. Patricia, a visually impaired author of erotic fiction, is the last to arrive. A projection of Elliot welcomes the guests, who have been hand-picked to attend. Carrie and Maurice find Neil's body, but assume it is art. The body falls, to Carrie's horror, when she pulls Neil's lanyard. Kenneth arrives, followed by Jean and Patricia. Leaving Maurice with the body, Kenneth and Jean force the lift doors while Patricia and Carrie talk. Bea is dead in the lift, a telephone receiver in her mouth and the cord around her neck. The lift is broken, and Kenneth heads off to find a fire escape. Kenneth and Jean meet Maurice in a corridor, while Carrie and Patricia wait near the lift. Carrie collapses, having drunk from a Champagne bottle. Kenneth, Jean, and Maurice find that a gate has been chained from the outside. The three split up. Patricia finds Carrie's body; she has burns on her face. Stumbling away, Patricia hides in a cubicle. Neil's murderer enters the toilet, and is revealed to be Jean. Kenneth finds Carrie's corpse, which is clutching pills. Maurice finds bolt cutters as Jean hurriedly washes her hands, then screams. Maurice and Kenneth come running, and Kenneth is first to arrive. Patricia is dead in the cubicle, her eyes missing. Kenneth, Jean, and Maurice rush to the chained gate. Kenneth suspects Maurice, as the pills were the latter's heart medication. As Maurice struggles with the chain, Kenneth knocks him out with the arm of a mannequin. Jean then suffocates Kenneth with a plastic bag. Maurice awakens tied to a wheelchair, listening to Elliot's projection. Jean is Elliot's mother; after Elliot's death, his body parts were donated. The recipients were to be a \\"living exhibition\\", but she believes his body parts were squandered. Neil had eaten his way into developing diabetes after a new kidney, Bea had tattooed her new skin, Carrie had drunk after a new liver, Patricia had produced pornography with her new eyes, Kenneth had smoked with his new lung, and Maurice was a \\"heartless critic\\", even with a new heart. Jean advances with an anaesthetic in a syringe as Maurice struggles in the chair. A journalist reports from an art exhibit featuring organs‚Äîincluding a heart‚Äîin jars. It has won the Turner Prize and broken box office records. She turns to interview the artist credited for the exhibit: Maurice. Analysis The episode is a homage to the 1973 horror film Theatre of Blood, and mystery fiction. It draws inspiration from the work of Agatha Christie, especially the 1939 novel And Then There Were None, and features a number of references to horror, including the 1976 film Carrie and the 1966 film Carry On Screaming! Critics also identified Amicus Productions films, including 1972's Tales from the Crypt and 1965's Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, as a potential influences, while one critic called it a morality tale. \\"Private View\\" portrays a \\"knowing self-awareness\\", with characters directly referencing the episode's source material, including Christie, genre tropes, and the Carry On films. Similarly, as is typical of mystery fiction, the killer was \\"the one you'd least expect\\". \\"Private View\\" satirises the pretentiousness of forms of contemporary art, but does so with the assumption that viewers are familiar with the art world, referencing, for example, Ron Mueck. One critic noted the work of Damien Hirst as a possible influence. The setting contrasts strongly with that of \\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\\", the previous episode, with the \\"Auton-ish mannequin limbs and all that neon light [giving] the episode a distinct look\\". Meanwhile, the sound design, featuring samples, muzak, and \\"Hitchcockian\\" chords, serves to distinguish scenes. Like \\"The Harrowing\\" and \\"S√©ance Time\\", the final episodes of the first two series of Inside No. 9, \\"Private View\\" is particularly dark. Reception The episode's cast, especially Fiona Shaw (pictured, 2016) received high praise. Critics offered high praise for \\"Private View\\", with many characterising it as a worthy end for a strong series. Several critics commended the contrast between the episode's humour and horror: Patrick Mulkern, of the Radio Times, called it \\"a scream, both darkly amusing and bloodily macabre\\", Julie McDowall, of The National, called it \\"a gruesome and darkly comic episode\\", and Sam Wollaston, of The Guardian, called it \\"Horrible, macabre and gruesome, but gloriously and hilariously so.\\" Dessau, similarly, praised the artistry and intellect of Shearsmith and Pemberton, describing the episode as \\"mixing gore with some darkly comic dialogue\\". Mark Butler, of i, praised the episode's humour and word-play, calling it \\"a grisly yet gleefully amusing close to a series packed with grisly and gleefully amusing moments\\". Louisa Mellor, writing for Den of Geek, described \\"Private View\\" as \\"the goriest and crudest story of this series\\". Mulkern commended the cast as \\"enviable\\", the freelance journalist Dan Owen described them as the best of the series, and Mellor called them a \\"delightful collection\\". She praised Robinson as \\"never-not-brilliant\\" and Shaw as \\"similarly top-notch\\", while Rachel Cooke described Shearsmith and Pemberton as \\"fantastic actors\\", comparing them favourably to Dick Emery in the way they can reinvent themselves every episode. A review in The Times, too, praised \\"guest turns\\" as \\"wonderful\\", picking out Shaw's performance in particular. Owen suggested that the episode leaned too strongly on its source material, but nonetheless claimed to have been wrong-footed by the plot. In a laudatory review of the episode, Cooke admitted that she was unable to make sense of the ending of \\"Private View\\", but said that such \\"unlooked-for moments when nothing quite makes sense\\", serve only to \\"emphasise [Inside No. 9] surpassing brilliance\\". For Mulkern, the ending was \\"to say the least, perplexing\\". Mellor explained the ending by saying that \\"Maurice must have escaped his restraints and overpowered Quinn's mother, then‚Äîspying an opportunity for instant fame and a wodge of artworld dosh‚Äîput her heart in formaldehyde and pretended to have masterminded the whole thing.\\" References External links \\"Private View\\" at BBC Programmes *\\"Private View\\" at the British Comedy Guide 2017 British television episodes Inside No. 9 episodes Organ transplantation in fiction Television episodes about serial killers ","title":"Private View (Inside No. 9)"},{"id":"53364608","text":"The Army of Robert Curthose of Normandy was led by Robert, Duke of Normandy, the eldest son of William the Conqueror. In 1096, Robert‚Äôs army left for the Holy Land on the First Crusade. He was reportedly so poor that he often had to stay in bed for lack of clothes. In order to raise money for the crusade he mortgaged his duchy to his brother William. His army joined the contingent of Robert II, Count of Flanders, and Stephen, Count of Blois. The known members of the army, mostly from Normandy and England, included the ones listed below, as reported in histories of the First Crusade.

Household and Clergy  According to Rinciman, the number of non-combatants in a Crusader army was less than 25%. Those who are known include: * Stephen of Aumale, nephew of William the Conqueror * Pagan Peverel, Standard-bearer of Robert. After his return from the Crusades, he was granted a barony in England. His daughter Matilda donated land to the Kerswell Priory. * Gilbert (Giselbert), later Bishop of Evreux, who was present at the council of Clermont * Alan of Dol-de- Bretagne, seneschal of the archbishopric of Dol-de-Bretagne. Alan‚Äôs nephew was Alan fitz Flaad, a renowned Breton knight, a mercenary of King Henry I. * Mainfinit, seneschal of Alan Fergent.

Alan was first part of the army of Hugh the Great and distinguished himself at the siege of Nicaea. * Arnulf (Ernulf) of Hesdin, Lord of Chipping Norton * Rotrou III, Count of Perche * William of Bayeux, related to Hugh de Grandmesnil (likely the same person as William FitzRanulf, son of Ranulf, Viscount of Bayeux and Mathilde d'Avranches) * Ralph of Ga√´l, Earl of East Anglia, and his wife Emma de Gauder, Countess of Norfolk. Ralph and Emma died on the journey to Jerusalem in 1096. * Alan of Ga√´l, son of Ralph of Ga√´l * Walter of Saint-Val√©ry and his sons Bernard II and Eudon, part of the Houses of Montlh√©ry and Le Puiset * Conon of Lamballe, grandson of Odo, Count of Penthi√®vre, originally in the army of Hugh the Great * Gerard of Gournay-en-Bray, accompanied by his wife Edith. Gerard was originally in the army of Hugh the Great. * Guy of Sarce, who sold the fiefs he held from the abbey of St. Vincent to participate in the Crusade * Hervey, son of Dodeman * Philip the Grammarian of Bell√™me, son of Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Mabel de Bell√™me. Philip was implicated in Robert of Mowbray‚Äôs rebellion on 1095, imprisoned but fled. He died in the siege of Antioch. * Hugh Bunel, who killed Mabel de Bell√™me, of the House of Bell√™me, after she took his lands by force. After this murder, he took service with Emperor Alexios Komnenos along with his brothers. * Pagan of Mondoubleau * Ralph the Younger of Montpin√ßon * Riou of Loh√©ac. Roiu obtained a casket of relics that included part of the True Cross and a piece of the Holy Sepulcher. * Roger of Barneville, killed during the siege of Antioch and was buried in the church of St. Peter there. * William of Ferrieres * William de Percy (William Percy of Topcliff).  The Relationship with Other Armies  It is believed that Robert‚Äôs army was the same size as the army of Godfrey of Bouillon. In addition, after Hugh the Great abandoned the Holy Land, approximately 100 knights under his command joined Robert‚Äôs army.

It is designed to study the physics of charm, charmonium, and light hadron decays. It also performs studies of the tau lepton, tests of QCD, and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiment started collecting data in the summer of 2008.  Beam  BES III receives electron‚Äìpositron collisions from BEPC II: a circular collider with a circumference of 240 m. BEPC II maintains a variable collision energy between 2 and 4.63 GeV, with a luminosity of 1033 cm‚àí2¬∑s‚àí1. Each of the beams contains 93 electron or positron bunches of length 1.5 cm and a total current of 0.91 A.  Detector  The BES III detector is a cylindrically symmetric 6-meter long and 7-meter diameter detector surrounding the interaction point of 2 beam pipe rings. It has 4 major detector layers: a main drift chamber (MDC), time- of-flight counter (TOF), cesium-iodide electromagnetic calorimeter (CsI EMC), and a muon counter (Muon Chamber, MC, ¬µC). The inner three layers are inside of a 1 Tesla superconducting solenoid magnet. The main drift chamber (MDC) is the first inner detector layer around the beam pipe and collision point. The MDC's main purpose is to measure the momentum and energy loss per unit distance (dE/dx) from charged particles. The chamber is 2.4 meters long and contains 6796 gold coated 25-micron tungsten signal wires that are arranged in 44 cylindrical layers. The half width of the inner 8 layers is 6 mm and the half width of the outer layers are 8.1 mm. Between the wires, a mixture of Helium and Propane gas are mixed together at a ratio of 60/40, designed to minimize multiple scattering and maintain a high dE/dx. Aluminum 110-micron wires are strung across the chamber for field shaping. As a charged particle passes through the chamber the gas becomes ionized along the path of the particle and the ions drift to the nearest wires. The particles path will be curved because of the magnetic field the solenoid creates. The amount of curvature allows for the momentum of the particle to be calculated. The TOF, the second inner detector, makes time measurements that are used to assist in particle identification and as a fast trigger to reject cosmic rays. The detector is made out of two cylindrical layers of 88 2.4-meters long plastic scintillating bars. There is a photo-multiplying tube (PMT) at each end of the bars. The two PMTs are averaged and the travel time of the photons are removed. The electromagnetic calorimeter‚Äôs main purpose is to make energy and position measurements using Caesium Iodide scintillating crystals. The geometry of the crystals is 44 rings of 120 crystals along the axis of the cylinder with a 1.5 degree tilt. Two endcaps covering the end of the cylinder allows a total coverage of 93% of the space. Photo detectors are placed at the ends of each crystal. Photon and electron energies can be measured in the range of 20 MeV to 4.6 GeV. The muon identifier (MI) is composed of nine layers of Iron absorbers and resistive plate counters (RPC). RPC are composed of two separated Bakelite plastic plates with gas between them and enclosed in an Aluminium box. Having MI enables discrimination between muons and kaons. A crucial component of the detector is the trigger system that selects the useful collision data to save for analysis. Before the trigger, there are 40 million background events per second detected, which is reduced to around 4 thousand interesting collisions per second. The trigger is hardware based, and its design is predetermined by Monte Carlo simulations.

The Toledan tradition maintains that this church is built on the site of the house where Saint Leocadia of Toledo was born, to which would belong a small underground room, where it is affirmed that it made prayer. This cave corresponds to the crypt located next to the right pillar of the presbytery, and is covered with a plaster crossery vault, which can be dated in the first half of the 16th century. In the tower and in the facade of the church are preserved, embedded, some fragments of Visigothic style's reliefs. It dates back to the 11th Century, but the oldest remains of its construction date from the 13th Century. The only remaining Mud√©jar elements are the tower, part of the entrance and the apse. The present appearance is due to the changes at the end of the 18th century, ordered by the queen Maria Luisa de Parma, wife of Carlos IV, a devout follower of the saint. The parish is mentioned in documents from the middle of the 12th century, with the denomination of \\"Santa Leocadia within Toledo\\", to differentiate it from another church, with the same name, \\"next to the alc√°zar\\", built in the place where the saint was in prison, and the basilica outside the walls, known as Cristo de la Vega, where she was buried. Both the present church and the tower respond, in their older parts, to the Toledan Mud√©jar of the end of the 13th century, which leads to think that existed another previous building, of which have not been remains. There are only references to think that the primitive arrangement was that of an isolated building, separated of the convento de Santo Domingo el Antiguo by a street that was suppressed, in times of Alfonso X of Castile, when extending that convent.

Appearances  The very first Cyber-Scouts infiltrated the United States Air Force's B-52 bomber holding the Dart, a rocket-powered fighter plane. At least two Scouts were identified in the comic, as they shared no distinguishable markings to that of the standard Cybermen also in the comic strip, Test Flight. Later, when a squadron of Cybermen were time scooped to the Death Zone on Gallifrey by Borusa, Cyber-Scouts were present when Cyber-Bombs were placed around the Doctor's TARDIS, in an effort to destroy it, in the television serial, The Five Doctors). When the Sixth Doctor was caught up in the Cybermen invasion of Earth, Cyber-Scouts were shown painted metallic black for camouflage purposes in the London Underground sewers. Other Cyber-Scouts stationed in the Telos Cyber base took direct orders from the Cyber Controller and one Scout even made it into the Doctor's TARDIS, when the Cyber Controller ambushed the Doctor. Other Scouts shown on Telos had again no distinguishable features and patrolled a set route, where some were attacked by Stratton and Bates in the television serial, Attack Of The Cybermen.  Weapons  The first Cyber- Scouts of Mondasian origin used their laser weapons, which were mounted onto their lower torso, as seen in the comic, Test Flight). In the Death Zone, Cyber-Scouts contributed in setting up the Cyber-Bombs to destroy the Doctor's TARDIS in the television serial, The Five Doctors. Later, the black painted Cyber-Scouts were armed with modified standard Cybermen weapons. These new weapons were bigger and more brightly coloured than their standard counterparts as seen in the television serial, Attack Of The Cybermen.

The Cyber-Scouts found in Peter Davison's era as the doctor were only distinguishable by the end credits mentioning who played the Cyber-Scouts. Later, with Colin Baker as the doctor, the scouts were painted black, to be better distinguished from other Cyberman variants. The Cyber-Scouts have never since made an appearance in the revival Doctor Who series.

Trained at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) in print-making and painting, Herndon is known for her lithographs and collages, many of which were produced in tandem with Jack Spicer's poetry, and intended for joint viewing and reading. More recently, Herndon has branched out to work in drawing and pastels. Herndon's work has been shown in solo and group exhibitions dating back to at least 1963, during which Herndon's \\"Grail Series\\" works were a part of the group exhibit, Exhibit. More recently, Herndon has had three solo shows in 2011 at Altman Siegel Gallery, Canessa Park Gallery, and The Apartment. In 2010, her work was part of the group exhibition, Breathless Days 1959-1960: A Chronotropic Experiment, at the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery. For most of her career, Herndon had no dealer and rarely sold her work, and her reputation was therefore greatest amongst fellow artists and poets. Her silence is typical of the artistic circles she ran in: San Francisco being far off the art map, San Francisco artists indulged in a kind of \\"nihilism,\\" rarely \\"took any precautions to preserve their work,\\" and \\"[d]ocumentation was unheard of.\\" Since 2011 she has been represented by the Altman Siegel Art Gallery. Early life and work Born in North Carolina and of Native American ancestry, Herndon lived for a time in France, where she met her then-husband Jim Herndon. The Herndons settled in San Francisco, where they had two children: Jay Herndon (1957-) and Jack Herndon (1960-). It was in San Francisco that she met the central poets associated with the San Francisco Renaissance: Jack Spicer, Robin Blaser, Robert Duncan, and Jess. More specifically, they were the poets of the Berkeley Renaissance, which was later \\"absorbed into a broader aesthetic, geographical, and temporal movement called the San Francisco Renaissance\\", alongside the clashing Beat aesthetics of Allen Ginsberg, Gary Snyder, and Philip Whalen. Her tutelage under and collaborations with Jack Spicer, in particular, resulted in various lithographs created in tandem with Spicer's poetry. His verse \\"allowed the poetry he wrote while working with Herndon to grow flat, more literal, incantatory, till it approaches the emotionally numb.\\" Artistic practices Alongside fellow artists such as Helen Adam, Paul Alexander (American artist), Jess and Tom Field, Herndon contributed to the development of a socially engaged school of art in California that \\"challenged the values of the East Coast School of Abstract Expressionism.\\" The visual and literary arts were crucial to creating local, West Coast and Bay Area variants of modernism. Her work has been described as one of \\"quiet [extremism]\\" and linked, in that way, to other West Coast artists connected to the San Francisco Renaissance such as Harry Jacobus, Jess Collins, Paul Alexander, and Tom Field. '' An example of Herndon's early work is her series of collages made in 1963 based on Sports Illustrated. These collages were later published as a part of Jim Herndon's memoirs of the collaboration between Herndon and Jack Spicer, Everything as Expected. Herndon continues to be invested in the convergence of the written and visual arts: her prints continue to be best viewed with \\"their intended volume of poetry\\" and her collages often make use of \\"clipped text swirling about in a manner somewhere between that of Richard F. Outcault's Yellow Kid comics and Richard Hamilton's similar collages.\\" Spicer impressed upon Herndon his own poetic strategies of \\"applying practical magic and using allegory to express the existential conflict and social upheaval that was central to the artistic ground swell of the Beat movement\\" which she, in turn, absorbed and put to use in her own practices of painting and printmaking. As her artistic practice matured, Fran Herndon became Spicer's closest collaborator. In an interview with Lewis Ellingham, she saiid that \\"He [Spicer] saw in me something greater than I saw in myself ‚Äì I think.\\"Ellingham, Lewis, and Kevin Killian. \\"Poet Be Like God: Jack Spicer and the San Francisco Renaissance.\\" Wesleyan: 1998. Writing for SFMOMA's OpenSpace project, Norma Cole stated that \\"Jack would come over to Fran and Jim Herndon's place in the evening and read the new poems to them. During the day Fran would walk up to the San Francisco Art Institute and create the beautiful, mysterious lithographs that would be in the book with the poems.\\" The close relationships between Herndon's practice and poetic practices, and between Herndon the artist and the many poets who at one point or another drew upon ideas coming out of the San Francisco Renaissance is apparent. At Herndon's 2012 solo exhibition at Vancouver's Blanket Gallery, for example, curator Lee Plested organised a special poetry reading including Meredith Quartermain, Gary Thomas Morse, Robin Blaser's partner, David Farwell, and George Stanley, whose 2003 poetry collection, \\"A Tall, Serious Girl\\" features Herndon's painting, \\"Eye on the Sea.\\" Her works continue to be curated and shown by poets such as Kevin Killian, just as she began her career by \\"showing at the experimental \\"poets' galleries\\" of the period (the Peacock Gallery, Buzz).\\" Editorial work In 1959, Herndon served as the art editor of the poetry/art magazine J, often credited as the first journal of the \\"mimeo revolution and the harbinger of hundreds of successors in the 60s and 70s.\\" The magazine was produced by Spicer via mimeograph in San Francisco. Herndon's contribution to the magazine was crucial: its \\"playful, even colorful, formal character thanks to Fran Herndon, who edited the artwork for the magazine\\" in combination with an \\"uncompromising editorial stance\\" led to J's establishment as a \\"representative of the best of the mimeograph revolution.\\" Together, Spicer and Herndon edited the first five issues of the magazine. J was named after the Herndons' first son, Jay. Solo exhibitions *Blanket Contemporary Art, Vancouver, British Columbia. (2012).

In lubrication theory in fluid mechanics, a body of liquid is assumed to be a thin film, i.e. considerably thinner in one Cartesian direction than in the two directions orthogonal to that. That is one of many problems that can be simplified if one can make some assumptions about the length scales that are relevant for the physical system.  Definition  The simplest form of a 2-dimensional thin film equation readsA. Oron, S. H. Davis, S. G. Bankoff, \\"Long-scale evolution of thin liquid films\\", Rev. Mod. Phys., 69, 931‚Äì980 (1997)H. Kn√ºpfer, \\"Classical solutions for a thin-film equation\\", PhD thesis, University of Bonn. : frac{partial h}{partial t} = -frac 1 {3mu} ablacdot left( h^3 , abla left( gamma , abla^2 h right)right) where Œº is the viscosity of the liquid, h(x,y,t) is the x-, y- and t-dependent film thickness and Œ≥ is the interfacial tension between the liquid and the gas phase above it. The parameter Œ≥ can also be a function of x and y, which is why it has been left inside the differentiation and not included in the numerator of the factor ‚àí1/(3Œº). The equation can be modified in many ways to fit different situations, and the most important of these is the addition of a disjoining pressure Œ†(h) in the equation,L. W. Schwartz, R. V. Roy, R. R. Eley, S. Petrash, \\"Dewetting patterns in a drying liquid film\\", Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 243, 363374 (2001). as in : frac{partial h}{partial t} = -frac 1 {3mu} ablacdotleft(h^3 abla left( gamma , abla^2 h-Pi (h) right)right) where the function Œ†(h) is usually very small in value for moderate-large film thicknesses h and grows very rapidly when h goes very close to zero.  Properties  From the simpler form of the equation, which doesn't contain the term Œ†(h), it is easy to see that one static (time-independent) solution is a paraboloid of revolution : h(x,y) = A - B(x^2 + y^2 ) , and this is consistent with the experimentally observed spherical cap shape of a static sessile drop, as a \\"flat\\" spherical cap that has small height can be accurately approximated in second order with a paraboloid. This, however, does not handle correctly the circumference of the droplet where the value of the function h(x,y) drops to zero and below, as a real physical liquid film can't have a negative thickness. This is one reason why the disjoining pressure term Œ†(h) is important in the theory. One possible realistic form of the disjoining pressure term is : Pi (h) = Bleft[left(frac{h_*} h right)^n - left(frac{h_*} h right)^m right] where B, h*, m and n are some parameters. These constants and the surface tension gamma can be approximately related to the equilibrium liquid-solid contact angle theta_e through the equationN.V. Churaev, V.D. Sobolev, Adv. Colloid Interface Sci. 61 (1995) 1-16 : B approx frac{(m-1)(n-1)}{h_* (n-m)}gamma (1-cos theta_e ) . The thin film equation can be used to simulate several behaviors of liquids, such as the fingering instability in gravity driven flow.L. Kondic, \\"Instabilities in gravity driven flow of thin liquid films\\", SIAM Review, 45, 95‚Äì115 (2003) The lack of a second-order time derivative in the thin-film equation is a result of the assumption of small Reynold's number in its derivation, which allows the ignoring of inertial terms dependent on fluid density rho. This is somewhat similar to the situation with Washburn's equation, which describes the capillarity-driven flow of a liquid in a thin tube.

He is noted for his instrumental role in the modernization of the army. Early life Borowski was born in Wilno (present-day Vilnius, Lithuania) in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the time a protectorate of the Russian Empire. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, Borowski gave varying accounts of his parentage, professing to be the illegitimate son of Prince Radziwill and a Jewish woman, or the son of a Jewish mother and a Polish nobleman. There is a possibility that his brother was the literary historian Leon Borowski (1784-1846). Sources on his early life are inconsistent. According to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, he had to flee to England either \\"presumably\\" during the Third Partition of Poland (1795), or that he departed from Poland in 1793, which however is inconsistent with Alma Mater, an academic publication produced by Jagiellonian University, which states that he participated in the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising of 1794, afterwards returning home. Military career According to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, after arriving in England, he later served abroad in South Africa and British India. According to Alma Mater, which does not contain any reference to his travels to England, Africa or India, in 1797 he joined the Polish Legions in Italy, and was part of the Polish contingent sent to quell the Haitian Revolution in 1802. Like many Poles who disliked quelling an independence movement, he then deserted the French side, and he himself joined the buccaneer organization Brethren of the Coast. Around 1805‚Äì1806 he joined a group of South American freedom fighters under Francisco de Miranda, and around 1810 he became one of the trusted lieutenants and later an adiutant of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. He was one of Bolivar's commanders during the campaign to liberate New Granada of 1819‚Äì1820, distinguishing himself in the Crossing of the Andes and the Battle of Boyac√°, and in 1821, at the Battle of Carabobo. Following the establishment of Gran Colombia, he lived in Bogot√° for at least two years, but political intrigues resulted in his decision to leave South America. He visited the United States and then traveled to the Middle East, where he worked for Muhammad Ali of Egypt and taught mathematics and English. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica states that at an unspecified time he moved to Iran on the request of then-crown prince Abbas Mirza, and entered Iranian service. According to Alma Mater he advocated Iranian intervention in the November Uprising (1830-1831). He quickly became on good terms with both the incumbent king Fath Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797-1834), as well as the crown prince himself. He successfully climbed the ranks and played a pivotal role in the modernization of the Iranian army. Later on, he was promoted to the rank of general. According to Alma Mater he received positions, titles or functions of a Vizier and Emir. Borowski was then assigned to Abbas Mirza's son, Mohammad Mirza (later known by his regal name of Mohammad Shah Qajar), who was the commander-in-chief of the Iranian forces besieging Herat in 1833. Upon Abbas Mirza's death in late 1833, and that of his father Fath Ali Shah a year after, Borowski remained loyal to Mohammad Mirza, and joined him in the ensuing war of succession. Some time after, Borowski, Qahreman Mirza (another son of Abbas Mirza) and Masoud Mirza managed to defeat the Uzbek incursions as well as the rebelling Turkmens, both in Khorasan. Death and legacy Borowski then served in the second siege of Herat (1837/38). According to Alma Mater, he was the commander-in-chief of the Iranian forces. Since the Iranian commanders were quarrelling among themselves and the Iranian army had low morale, Borowski took the lead in the field himself. This siege would be his last, for he was mortally wounded by a bullet to the abdomen, while personally leading an assault on the enemy fortifications. He died not long afterwards. He was buried in the Armenian cemetery in New Julfa (the Armenian quarter of Isfahan). The French inscription on his grave gives 24 June 1838 as his date of death. After his death, a friend of Borowski in the Iranian army, an Italian named Barthelemy Semino, married his widow (an Armenian woman from New Julfa), and he reportedly took care of his children as well. According to the sources, Borowski is said to have made a \\"considerable\\" amount of wealth in the years he served in Iran. However, most of it apparently had gone missing around the time his testament was to be invoked, that testament being in the possession of Aleksander Chod≈∫ko, a \\"compatriot\\" of Borowski and Russian consul in Rasht. According to Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, Borowski was survived by his two sons. The first one, Stanislaw, would become a teacher at the Dar ul-Fonun school. He died in Tehran in 1898. Borowski's second son would enter the service of the Iranian government as well, but he committed suicide not long after. Alma Mater, however, mentions only Antoni Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç-Borowski, who also became a general in the Iranian service, and took part in Siege of Herat (1856).

She and her sister Hendrika Arnolda were the daughters of Arnold Jens, vice president of the aldermen in Batavia and his wife Anna Apollonia de Geus. She was very young when her father died and her mother remarried the widower Andries van Vessem, manager of the Batavian Orphanage. Thus Anna and Hendrika got a half-brother, Hendrik, who died in 1805. In 1782, being fifteen years old, she was married to the First Administrator of the Warehouses Gose Theodore Vermeer with whom she had six children. Two years after his death in 1791 she married the seven years younger Junior Merchant Gerrit Willem Casimir van Motman in 1793 with whom she had two children, that probably died very young. In 1797, after four years marriage, Gerrit van Motman filed for divorce and left to live in Buitenzorg. The divorce came into effect in 1809. During the nine years of her first marriage to Gose Theodore, Anna Jens acquired the dubious reputation that she treated her house slaves with exceptional cruelty. Her behaviour apparently attracted considerable attention as the High Government in Batavia interfered. She was indicted and fined at a number of occasions and eventually summoned before the Supreme Court in Batavia, convicted for abuse, all rights to keep slaves were withdrawn and she was placed under observation. It remains unknown how her family, her husbands and children in particular, reacted to her atrocities, that were considered unacceptable at the time. She violated the ban and in 1809 was finally shunned from operating any business and sentenced to a 25-year prison term. After having only served two years she was set free on the condition that she would remain unmarried. Anna Apollonia Jens died three years later in September of 1815 in Semarang. Why Victor Ido van de Wall dedicated an entire chapter to Anna Apollonia Jens in his 1923 chronicle Vrouwen uit den Compagnie‚Äôs tijd is unclear. Perhaps because of the rather sadistic, yet also tragic aspects of her life story, or perhaps as a rare example of cruel behavior that was unacceptable even at the time and place. He himself called her a pitiful figure, a remark that could imply it would have been better, had she been put under professional mental treatment.

This sector includes fertility solutions, period-tracking app, pregnancy and nursing care, women's sexual wellness, and reproductive system health care. Overview The concept of a digital women's health category is relatively new. Femtech was coined in 2016 by Ida Tin, a Danish entrepreneur who founded Clue, a period- and fertility-tracking app. As an industry, femtech largely encompasses any digital or standard health tools aimed at women's health, including wearables, internet-connected medical devices, mobile apps, hygiene products, and others. Companies and products There are numerous femtech companies offering a variety of different products throughout the world. Companies that produce period- and/or fertility-tracking mobile apps include, Clue, DOT, Glow, Eve, Cycles, My Calendar, Life, FertilityIQ, Extend Fertility, Forte Medical, Flo, Lady Cycle and others. Companies that offer services like IVF, egg freezing, and medical treatments include Univfy, Progyny, Apricity and Prelude Fertility. Similarly, the fertility company, Ava, produces a wearable that tracks fertility. By contrast, Nurx provides a telemedicine service where women can get birth control prescribed via an app, and have the pills delivered. Twentyeight Health, another birth control delivery service, takes this model a step further by providing resources for underserved women and Medicaid populations. Companies like Gennev address menopause issues. Several companies also produce internet-connected medical devices that are often paired with mobile apps to track specific data. For instance, Elvie and Willow produce a wearable breast pump. The Elvie breast pump also connects to an app. Elvie also offers a kegel-tracking device. kegg recently launched a 2-in-1 fertility tracker that senses electrolyte levels of cervical fluid and assists the user in pelvic floor exercises. Lioness produces a smart vibrator with an app that uses biofeedback to help people learn more about their own bodies. Other medical devices and implements produced in the femtech category may or may not use an internet connection. Joylux is a women's health technology company creating medical and feminine wellness devices under the vSculpt and vFit brands.

Cora, which sells organic pads, tampons and personal care products, received $7.5 million to begin selling their products in Target stores. In early 2019, Elvie raised $42 million in Series B funding, for a total of more than $50 million since their 2013 founding. Estimates suggest that around $200 billion is being spent on femtech products each year. According to Forbes, femtech companies face challenges in raising money, because women's health issues are not always understood by investors, women are underrepresented in the investment community, and female founders are reluctant to ask for money. Just 10% of global investment goes to female-led startups. Data Bridge, a research firm, predicts that by 2026 the global fertility industry could raise up to $41 billion in sales, from $25 billion today.

The name and origin of her family and her parents' identity are unknown. However, baptized a Catholic at the age of three, she was raised in the household of Margaretha Catharina van Wargaren, wife of notary Wiggert Wargaren and probably her godmother. As Mrs. Wargaren provided her with a European upbringing, Angelina became accustomed to and introduced into the culture, manners and habits of the wealthy bourgeoisie class of Batavia, where she would also have made the acquaintances and personal contacts that led to her future marriages. Marriages She would - remarkably for an indigenous woman and born a slave - eventually marry three European men, that she had met among the influential circles of government and business of Batavia. Her first marriage to a German lieutenant, named Johann Samuel Heinrich W√ºstenberg (1765 - 1803), brought her into possession of the Tjitrap Estate on Bali island and a share of another property in Soekaradja (southern Sumatra), which her husband had acquired around 1800. W√ºstenberg died in 1803. Her second marriage to Johannes Loetzrich took place a few months later in 1803. A third marriage at an unknown time and place to marine captain Adriaan Maarschalk from Zoutelande suggests that she also had survived her second husband. Angelina has experienced a phenomenal social increase in her life. From her origin as an orphan and slave she became owner of the colonial Estate at Tjitrap and at Sukkah Raja, she amassed a vast financial fortune and was respected among the top colonial elite of early nineteenth-century Batavia.

The earliest known life forms on Earth are putative fossilized microorganisms found in hydrothermal vent precipitates. The earliest time that life forms first appeared on Earth is at least 3.77 billion years ago, possibly as early as 4.28 billion years, or even 4.5 billion years; not long after the oceans formed 4.41 billion years ago, and after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth are microfossils of microorganisms permineralized in 3.465-billion-year-old Australian Apex chert rocks.  Biosphere  Currently, Earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbor life. The Earth's biosphere extends down to at least below the surface, and up to at least into the atmosphere, and includes soil, hydrothermal vents, and rock. Further, the biosphere has been found to extend below the ice of Antarctica, and includes the deepest parts of the ocean, down to rocks kilometers below the sea floor. In July 2020, marine biologists reported that aerobic microorganisms (mainly), in \\"quasi-suspended animation\\", were found in organically-poor sediments, up to 101.5 million years old, 250 feet (76.2 m) below the seafloor in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) (\\"the deadest spot in the ocean\\"), and could be the longest-living life forms ever found. Under certain test conditions, life forms have been observed to survive in the vacuum of outer space. More recently, in August 2020, bacteria were found to survive for three years in outer space, according to studies conducted on the International Space Station. The total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon. According to one researcher, \\"You can find microbes everywhere ‚Äì [they are] extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.\\" Of all species of life forms that ever lived on Earth, over five billion, more than 99%, are estimated to be extinct. Some estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent remain undescribed. However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates 1 trillion species currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described. Additionally, there are an estimated 10 nonillion (10 to the 31st power) individual viruses (including the related virions) on Earth, the most numerous type of biological entity, and which some biologists consider to be life forms. Moreover, there are more individual viruses than all the estimated stars in the universe; which, in turn, are considered to be more numerous than all the grains of beach sand on planet Earth. About 200 virus types are known to cause diseases in humans. Other possible virus-like forms, some pathogenic, less likely to be considered living, much smaller than viruses and possibly much more primitive, include viroids, virusoids and prions.  Earliest life forms  Archaea, prokaryotic microbes, were first found in extreme environments, such as hydrothermal vents. The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years; the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago. There is evidence that suggests life began as early as 4.5 billion years ago. A December 2017 report stated that 3.465-billion-year-old Australian Apex chert rocks once contained microorganisms, the earliest direct evidence of life on Earth. A 2013 publication announced the discovery of microbial mat fossils in 3.48 billion- year-old sandstone in Western Australia. Evidence of biogenic graphite, and possibly stromatolites, were discovered in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in southwestern Greenland, and described in 2014 in the journal Nature. Potential \\"remains of life\\" were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia, and described in a 2015 study. The theory of panspermia suggests that life on Earth may have come from biological matter carried by space dust or meteorites. A 2016 genetic study concluded that the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) may have lived in deep-sea hydrothermal vents 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. A 2018 study from the University of Bristol, applying a molecular clock model, places the LUCA shortly after 4.5 billion years ago, within the Hadean. In March 2017, fossilized microorganisms (microfossils) were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates from an ancient sea-bed in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada. These may be as old as 4.28 billion years, the oldest evidence of life on Earth, suggesting \\"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\\" after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago. Some researchers even speculate that life may have started nearly 4.5 billion years ago. According to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, \\"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth ‚Ä¶ then it could be common in the universe.\\" As for life on land, in 2019 scientists reported the discovery of a fossilized fungus, named Ourasphaira giraldae, in the Canadian Arctic, that may have grown on land a billion years ago, well before plants were living on land. In July 2018, scientists reported that the earliest life on land may have been bacteria 3.22 billion years ago. In May 2017, evidence of microbial life on land may have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old geyserite in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. In January 2018, a study found that 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life.

Biography  = Early life = Sergey Jacques Paramonov was born on 4 November 1894 in Kharkiv, which was part of the Russian Empire at that time. Both his parents came from the village near Odessa. His father's full name was Yakiv Yukhymovych Paramonov. Sergey Paramonov's paternal grandparents were peasants. Sergey's mother's full maiden name was Olha Ivanivna Buravchuk. Her father Ivan Maksymovych Buravchuk was a well-educated and respectful person, he worked as an agronomist. Olha's mother was descended of serfs. Sergey's father Yakiv studied at Kherson Agricultural Institute, where he obtained the forester qualification. During his studying Yakiv Paramonov got under influence of the Narodniks movement, as the result he was taking part in student unrest and was arrested in 1893, together with the future Bolshevik functionary Alexander Tsiurupa. At the beginning of 1894 Yakiv Paramonov married Olha Buravchuk and soon their first son Sergey was born in Kharkiv. In his known letter to the mother Sergey Paramonov mentioned Raikivtsi, where she had nursed him as a toddler. It is probably the village in Podolia, but this village is not mentioned in any known S. Paramonov's official documents. In 1902 the Paramonov family moved into Polotsk, where their second son Oleksiy was born in March 1903. From 1904 to 1908 Yakiv Paramonov worked as a forester in the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate. At that time Sergey was studying at Veliky Ustyug Gymnasium, which was more than 50 kilometres from their home through difficult forest roads. In 1908 the family moved closer to their home village Yasky. Yakov Paramonov got a job as a forester on the opposite bank of the Dniester river in Cioburciu village, now in Moldova, of the Bessarabia Governorate. Therefore, Sergey Paramonov continued his education in the uyezd centre at Akkerman Gymnasium, now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Ukraine. = Kiev period = Kiev University at the time of Paramonov's study In 1912 Sergey Paramonov graduated from Akkerman Gymnasium and entered Kiev University. He choose Zoology as a main subject, his favourite branch was Ornithology at that time. Despite the fact that in all known official documents Paramonov was mentioned as an ethnic Russian, he took part in the Ukrainian National Revival movement. In 1914 and 1915 Ukrainian organizations were trying to conduct the celebration of Taras Shevchenko's 100 years anniversary, as a result the police arrested some activists. During these events Sergey was detained twice for a month each time. To avoid more serious punishment Paramonov was helped by the privatdozent Viktor Kazanovsky's protection. In 1915 Sergey Paramonov published his first scientific note \\"On the record of the spotted cuckoo in Bessarabian Government\\" in the Ornithological Journal. He found, a very rare bird in the Russian Empire, the spotted cuckoo by himself while he was having a holiday at his parents' in Cioburciu. In spite of World War I and the collapse of the Russian Empire, Sergey managed to successfully graduate from Kiev University in 1917 and to get a job at the Kiev's station of plant pest control, where Viktor Kazanovsky worked as a director.Viktor Kazanovsky // Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine It was the first time when Sergey faced practical dipterology. In particular he worked on a problem how to use parasitic flies as a natural limit of a number of pest insects. In September 1918 the Kiev's station of plant pest control was moved to the village of Starosillia near Chernobyl because of the Ukrainian‚ÄìSoviet War. On 14 November 1918 the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was established by order of the Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadskyi. On 1 May 1919 the Academy opened the . The biologist was a museum director and the collection manager was the entomologist . After the Red Army captured Kiev in November 1919, the teacher of Sergey, Mr Kazanovsky, died in mysterious way, so Sergey Paramonov started supporting his widow and children. After a while in 1920 he married to Kazanovsky's widow Svitlana, who was 13 years older than him. It might have been just a Christian marriage because Soviet authorities did not recognise it. Sergey Paramonov was mentioned as a single person in all Soviet documents. The Ukrainian Academy of Sciences building in 1930 where the Zoological Museum was located. In 1920 Paramonov started working at the Zoolofical Museum of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. He donated to the museum his own collection of more than 12 thousand copies of the diptera and 64 skins of birds. In 1923‚Äì25 he had the scientific expeditions to the Crimea and Transcaucasia under the aegis of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. In 1924 Vienna entomological journal \\"Konowia\\" published three of Paramonov's articles about new species of the Syrphidae and Bombyliidae families, followed by other publications about the Diptera order in domestic and foreign scientific journals. In 1926 he set off the expeditions to Central Asia and in 1927 to Armenia. The result of these expeditions and the further scientific research and systematics became his four large monographs. In 1928 Paramonov went for research work to the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde in Berlin. He met with his colleagues, entomologists G√ºnther Enderlein and Erich Martin Hering, there. In 1930 the Institute of Zoology of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences was established and the evolutionist Ivan Schmalhausen became its first director. Paramonov started working as an editor-in-chief of the Institute journal. In 1935 he conducted a research in Pryazovia (Sea of Azov coast). In 1938 during the Political repression in the Soviet Union Sergey's father Yakiv was arrested and executed. In 1940 Sergey Parmonov wrote and defended the thesis \\"Palearctic Bombyliidae\\", thus he earned the Doctor of Sciences in Biology, soon he was appointed as a director of the Zoological Museum. On 19 September 1941 Nazi Germany captured Kiev. According to memoirs of his colleague the zoologist Yevdokia Reshetnyk,Evdokia Reshetnik, –Ñ–≤–¥–æ–∫—ñ—è –†–µ—à–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ (1903‚Äì1990) - Google Scholar Citations Paramonov saved several building including the Ukrainian opera house, the Academy of Science, and others by pointing Germans to places where Bolsheviks had laid explosives to blow the opera house up.1994 Reshetnik Ukrainske Slovo //Google Docs Paramonov was going on working at the Zoological Museum though he stopped holding the director post. Germans appointed the zoologist as a director because he was a volksdeutsche. At the time of Nazi occupation the Austrian entomologist Karl E. Schedl was working at the Ukrainian Zoological Museum too. Germans decided to evacuate the museum because of the Soviet advance, so Nazis declared museum exhibits as war trophies and sent them to Pozna≈Ñ. = Emigration = One of the Paramonov's objects of study - the family Tachinidae In September 1943 Sergey Paramonov had to accompany exhibits of the to Pozna≈Ñ and then in 1945 to Berlin, some of them still have been keeping in the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde. In April 1945 Nazis arrested him and wanted to shoot. Paramonov managed to save his life by protection of a \\"familiar professor\\", who might have been Erich Martin Hering. Escaping Sergey Paramonov fled to Hanover then to Bachenberg. Some sources say that he was put into the Nazi concentration camp near Munden,A. I.

When forces of allies captured this part of Germany, Paramonov went to Paris. In June 1945 he arrived in Paris. Here Paramonov got in a difficult position because he did not have any livelihoods. Therefore, he wrote letters to his friends-scientists for help to find an appropriate job corresponding his knowledge and qualification. Thus Theodosius Dobzhansky offers him a place in his laboratory in the United States to study the drosophilid taxonomy. Another Sergey's friend the entomologist Boris Uvarov asked the chief of CSIRO Alexander John Nicholson about vacancies in Australia. In fact, after Andr√© L√©on Tonnoir's death in 1940,Andr√© L√©on Tonnoir, Entomologist. // Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New Zealand [electronic resource] CSIRO was looking for an experienced entomologist-taxonomist, so in October 1946 Paramonov was offered to apply for a job at CSIRO. While there were being bureaucratic formalities, he left for London to study Australian diptera at the British Museum. In March 1947, Sergey Paramonov came to Australia.National Archives of Australia: SP11/2, STATELESS/PARAMONOV S J, Sergey Jacques Paramonov [Stateless, formerly Russian - arrived Sydney per ASTURIAS, 14 March 1947. Box 192] On arrival, he faced a number of problems. The issue of his appointment at CSIRO was raised by MP Joe Abbott in the Parliament of Australia as he guessed that Paramonov might have been a Soviet spy. After thorough consideration, it was decided to keep the position at CSIRO for Paramonov, but to restrict him the access to certain areas in Australia for national security reasons.National Archives of Australia: A367,C77955, PARAMONOV, Sergey [Sergei] Jacques, Professor - Commonwealth Investigation Service enquiries Another challenge was English language. Paramonov was not very good at English at first so he continued writing his scientific articles mainly in German in the first few years, thus there were some difficulties to publish them in Australia. Since his English got better, Paramonov published his first article in Australia about the Mydidae, followed by monographs about: the Streblidae, Microtropesa (1951), Nemestrinidae, Apioceridae (1953), Cyrtidae, Scenopinidae, Tapeigaster (Neottiophilidae) (1955), Hirmoneura (Nemestrinidae), Cylindromyia, Saralba (Tachinidae) (1956), Acroceridae (1957), Pyrgotidae (1958) and Leptidea (1962). His last lifetime article was –∞ review of the Lygira (Bombyliidae) species in 1967. After his death, an article about the family Tachinidae was published in 1968. He also wrote small articles for the \\"Notes on Australian Diptera\\".Notes on Australian Diptera (XXV): Annals and Magazine of Natural History: Vol 10, No 118Paramonov S.

He was a parishioner of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. He wrote articles for Ukrainian emigrant magazines, mostly about science and religion, which he signed as Serhiy Paramoniv.  Sergey Lesnoy  The photo of Izenbek's plank in Lesnoy's book - \\"The history of Rus' people in a not perverted form\\". Being in Paris in 1945, Sergey Paramonov met the editor of the Russian emigrant S. Plautin. They were discussing the article of Paramonov's Kiev colleague the zoologist \\"The Tale of Igor's Campaign in terms of Natural science\\",Mykola Sharleman, the list of publications // I. I. Schmalhausen Institute of Zoology which was published in Ukrainian language in 1940. As a result of the conversation, Paramonov was offered to write a small article for the Vozrozhdeniye with an analysis of Sharleman's work. Thus he wrote the article \\"The Tale of Igor's Campaign from the point of view of a naturalist\\" and signed it as Sergey Lesnoy for some reasons.The Tale of Igor's Campaign from the point of view of a naturalist The pseudonym Lesnoy may come from his father's job - the forester. The Russian word les () means a forest.Translations of ¬´–ª–µ—Å¬ª (Ru-En) on ABBYY Lingvo Live After writing his first article, the ancient history of the East Slavs became his topic of interest, so while he was living in Australia Paramonov wrote series of compositions about it. The compositions that were written in Russian he signed as Sergey Lesnoy. Besides that he tried himself in literature. His most significant works in Russian were: * The Tale of Igor's Campaign.

The magazine contained a letter from their Brussels' reader , where he reported about strange artifacts ‚Äì carved planks, which had been found by near Kharkiv, when he had been serving as a colonel of the Volunteer Army. According to Mirolubov after the White movement defeat, Izenbek took the planks in emigration and they were lost in Belgium during the Second World War. Mirolubov claimed that he had managed to copy down some texts of them. Paramonov was very impressed that information and took from Kurenkov and Mirolubov all available materials about Izenbek's planks. Among other Paramonov gained a photograph of plank 16, there was the only one plank, the quality photo of which had been made. The text of that plank begins with the words: \\"–í–ª–µ—Å –∫–Ω–∏–≥—É —Å—ñ—é\\" (Vles the book this). So Paramonov decided to call the whole text of the Izenbek's planks as \\"–í–ª–µ—Å–æ–≤–∞ –ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞\\" or \\"The Book of Wles\\" in English. The tomb of the scientist in the Woden Cemetery Initially Sergey Paramonov believed in the Book of Veles authenticity and reckoned that it had been written in the Proto-Slavic language. He started studying and analyzing the text and wrote articles about it for Ukrainian and Russian emigrant magazines. In fact S. Paramonov made the information about the Book of Veles to be available for the general public. Eventually it resulted that the Book of Veles has become like the Bible for many Slavic neopaganism movements. Paramonov needed to prove the Book of Veles authenticity so he sent all his researches and all materials, he had, to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR under the mediation of the University of Melbourne. The Soviet scientists verdict was: \\"The Book of Veles is a literary forgery\\".  Death  During the last ten years of his life Sergey Paramonov severely suffered from arthritis, angina and chronic nephritis . After the visit him by the slavist Boris Unbegaun in September 1967, who strongly criticised Paramonov's investigations into the Book of Veles, his health deteriorated significantly. On 18 September 1967 Sergey's younger brother Oleksiy died in Bordon, England. On 19 September Sergey Paramonov was taken to a Canberra hospital where he died on 22 September 1967, in the age of 72. Sergey Paramonov was buried in the Woden Cemetery.

Bio and Career  Mahdi was born in Jerusalem and completed his high school education at St. George's before immigrating to the U.S. Abu-Omar received a B.S. in Chemistry from Hampden-Sydney College, Virginia, in 1992. He began his scientific research in Inorganic and Organometallic Chemistry at Iowa State University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1996 under Professor James H. Espenson. His doctoral thesis described the kinetics and mechanisms of oxygen atom transfer reactions of methyltrioxorhenium (MTO). Following that, Abu-Omar spent a year as an NIH Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech with Professor Harry B. Gray, studying long range electron-transfer in rhenium-modified metalloproteins. Mahdi started his independent academic career as an assistant professor at UCLA, moved to Purdue University in 2004, was appointed R. B. Wetherill Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Purdue University in 2013, and moved back to California in 2016, where he currently holds the Mellichamp Chair in green chemistry at UCSB.  Research  Abu-Omar's interdisciplinary research addresses fundamental problems in energy science, sustainability, and green chemistry at the interface of inorganic chemistry and catalysis. Much of modern life materials are based on nonrenewable petroleum. Over the past decade the Abu-Omar research group contributed to biomass conversion and bio- inspired chemistry by discovering and developing new transformations that provide access to new molecules that are precursors to renewable materials and fuels. A unifying theme for much of Abu-Omar's research is the combination of synthetic chemistry with detailed mechanistic investigations through chemical kinetics. Abu-Omar has authored more than 150 original research articles in scientific journals, and supervised 35 Ph.D. students as well as several postdoctoral scholars. Among Mahdi's research contributions are the discovery of catalytic perchlorate remediation, the conversion of lignin from intact biomass to aromatic chemicals and introduction of a new biorefinery concept known as lignin-first, discovery of rhenium-catalyzed H2-driven deoxydehydration (DODH) of biomass-derived polyols, the development of bio- inspired catalysts for on-demand production of chlorine dioxide in water under ambient temperature, pressure and neutral pH, and development of kinetic methods for the study of olefin polymerization catalysts.

Soft power rankings  China ranked 2nd out of 20 nations in the Elcano Global Presence Report for 2018 by the Elcano Royal Institute. The report noted that China's Reputation ranking (24th) was considerably lower than its Influence ranking (2nd). China ranked 5th out of 60 nations in the Global Soft Power Index for 2020 by Brand Finance. It described China's (along with Russia's) high position as having \\"disturbed the Western, liberal soft power status quo\\". According to the 2019 Asia Power Index, China takes the lead in diplomatic influence and ranks 2nd out of 25 countries on cultural influence after the US. China's ranked 27th out of 30 nations in the Soft Power 30 index for 2018 and 2019 published by Portland Communications and the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. According to the index, China is a \\"cultural juggernaut\\", being ranked 8th in the Culture category and 10th in the Engagement category.  Global influence and diplomacy  China's traditional culture has been a source of attraction, building on which it has created several hundred Confucius Institutes around the world to teach its language and culture. The enrollment of foreign students in China has increased from 36,000 a decade before to at least 240,000 in 2010. China is the most popular country in Asia for international students after overtaking Japan in 2005, the leading destination globally for Anglophone African students, and the second most popular education power house in the world. China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has attracted many western countries to join. China has the largest diplomatic network in the world, overtaking the US in 2019. A spring 2014 Global Attitudes survey from Pew Research Center states China receives mostly positive reviews in the sub- Saharan African nations polled, although South Africans are closely divided (45% favorable, 40% unfavorable). China's increasing soft power can be explained by looking at China's economic growth and regarding economic engagement with many African countries. China's expansion of trade and investment on the African continent and the spread of Chinese-led infrastructure projects gives positive impressions of China to people in Africa. China's economic engagement in African countries is considered as much more pragmatic and in consistency with the priorities of many African countries. Moreover, China's increasing role as a global superpower seems appealing and this drives a desire to tie African economies more closely to China's economy. Through the use of GONGOs (otherwise known as a Government- organized non-governmental organization), China exerts soft power through foreign aid and development in Africa. China has made a systematic effort to expand and give greater profile to its soft-power policies in Africa ever since the first Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in 2000. The commitments of China's soft power ranges from health, humanitarian assistance to academic, professional and cultural exchange. Cultural exchange between China and Africa can be a representative example of how China has been spreading its soft power. In 2005, the first Confucius Institute was established in Africa. The institute is funded by the Chinese government and it provides Chinese language and cultural programming to the public. There are 19 institutes today in Africa and China has planned to spend 20 million RMB for education projects in South Africa, including the teaching of Mandarin in 50 local high schools. Furthermore, there is an increasing support for cultural visitors programs which gained momentum in 2004 when the African Cultural Visitors Program was established. There is a rising number of African entrepreneurs who choose to move to China and there are also diaspora communities in many Chinese cities that have been found.Jennifer G. Cooke. China's soft power in Africa; Outside of Africa, Chinese soft power extends to countries like Barbados. Barbadian Prime Minister David Thompson expressed admiration for the Chinese economic model and sought to emulate the way Chinese state controlled banks guided development. The Chinese soft-Power in the Middle East countries have been expanding since the beginning of the millennium, and include many efforts in the fields of education, journalism, and popular culture. The increase of soft power of China has created a backlash in the United States, where the government has started closing Confucius Institutes. The use of Chinese medical aid during the COVID-19 pandemic has been dubbed \\"facemask diplomacy\\".

It was founded after the city was taken by King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n and Castile in the 13th century. The city underwent transformations between the 14th and 18th centuries. This is a religious temple under the invocation of the holy children Justus and Pastor.  History  Throughout the 14th century, the church underwent multiple rounds of reconstruction. Included was the preservation of the chapel of Corpus Christi (next to the Main chapel), which is constructed of a rectangular stay, a cover of wood and rich decoration in azulejos. The remains of the Mud√©jar apse, built in brick and with the decoration of blind arches, are also considered to be part of the reconstruction done in the 14th century. However, they may correspond to earlier work, as indicated from their external rig configuration. In the 15th and 16th centuries, three chapels with ribbed vaults were added, which open to the nave of the epistle. One of them, dedicated to the Virgen de la Esperanza, includes a remarkable Plateresque fence. In the 17th century, the temple was again altered, with the central nave losing its previous Mud√©jar character. According to traces and conditions noted by Juan Bautista Monegro, the brick octo-sided pillars that delineated the central nave of the previous church were replaced in 1612 with two pillars, each with a pair of identical attached half-columns and composed of granite from the Las Ventas con Pe√±a Aguilera's quarries. Facade During the 18th century, the transformation of the temple was completed through plastering, pictorial decoration of the interior elevations, execution of the lateral naves' ceilings and finalization of the exterior. The unique entryway is posed as a tower-portal, something unusual in Toledan architecture. The portal is thus placed in the lower part of the temple tower, which stands out from the temple's main floor. The portal (altarpiece type) is raised in a body, which entails effective access between pilasters and a penthouse with niche, arranged to house the titular saints' sculptures. The exterior elevations, except for the Mud√©jar apse, have a reddish plaster, under which is seen, in some parts, another imitation plaster of brick.

Among these sexual content in the media, pornography has been a big business, generating $13 billion just in the U.S. in 2006. Researchers have reached agreement on some effects of sexual content in the media, such as arousal and some attitudinal effects. However, there is still an argument on whether the Catharsis effects resulting from the sexual media content. Types of sexual content Scholars analyzed the violent sexual content based on different types of sexual content, including rape, bondage, torture, sadomasochism, hitting, spanking, hair pulling, genital mutilation, and nonviolent sexual material. Nonviolent sexual material is much harder to categorize. Some nonviolent sexual material is entirely mutually consenting and affectionate, depicting vagina or oral intercourse in a loving, or at least non-coercive, fashion. On the other hand, some nonviolent sexual material is sexually dehumanizing, depicting degradation, domination, subordination or humiliation. Nonviolent sexual material presents the woman with few human attributes besides body parts and sexual appetite. Effects of sexual content in the media =Arousal= One crucial effect of consuming sexual media is sexual arousal, \\"the heightened physiological state that energizes sexual behavior. Arousal can be measured in two methods. One method is self-ratings of participants and the other is that physiological measures such as electronic sensors measuring penile tumescence, vaginal lubrication, or temperature (thermography). Some researchers found that men are more aroused by sexual media than are women, especially in response to sexually violent or dehumanizing materials. Also, sexual violence may only appeal to sex offenders and other violence-prone men and even to \\"normal\\" men if the victim is portrayed as being aroused by the assault. Slides or verbal descriptions of coercive sex are more appealing to sexually coercive men physiologically than \\"normal\\" men. Since the Internet provides an unlimited number of websites that feature any sexual desire that the user wants, it results in sexual arousal because the stimuli are new. Carnes think that the Internet can allow people to see any of their fantasy, which usually do not exist in most people's daily lives. These images can be reactivated during sexual intercourse. = Attitudinal effects = One of the major criticism from scholars is that the dehumanization of women in sexually explicit materials. Men rated their own partners as being less physically endowed after seeing beautiful female nudes engaged in sexual activity. It seems that the voluptuous model has become the norm or anchor to which real people are compared. Zillmann and Bryant also found that such effects are not limited to men. Compared with control groups, both men and women who watched weekly pornographic films later reported that they are less satisfied with their partners' affection, appearance, sexual curiosity, and sexual performances. They also sex with less emotional involvement and showed greater acceptance of premarital and extramarital sex. They placed fewer values on monogamy and marriage. Teenagers who have watched a whole day of talk shows discussing sexual topics later overestimated the frequency of such behaviors. = Individual differences = Different people have different reactions to sexual content in the media. Men are more likely to be aroused by sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves. It does not mean that men are more interested in sex videos than women. Women have been found to be more interested in written and directed by women and for women, while men appear to be more interested in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it. Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized. Personality can also be an indicator of individuals' different reactions to sexual content. Bushman, Bonacci, van Dijk, and Baumeister found that narcissistic men will be more likely to enjoy the rape scene preceded by affection between the parties than low narcissists did. Borgaert's study considered intelligence is a mediator between personality and arousal attitudes. Men, who have lower intelligence and higher aggressive/antisocial inclinations, are more likely to prefer violent sexual stimuli than men higher in intelligence and lower in aggressive/antisocial tendencies. = Behavioral effects = Bryant and Zillmann concluded that potential behavioral effects of violent sexual media content include: catharsis, disinhibition, imitation, and desensitization.  Catharsis  Catharsis holds that \\"vicariously participating in others' fictionalized hostility or aggression enables drama watchers, readers, or listeners to be purged of their anger and hostility and thereby become less aggressive.\\" This popular idea comes directly from psychodynamic models of personality. The Catharsis effect has been applied to support loosening restrictions on pornography and it has also been reported by sex offenders as a strategy for reducing impulses for committing an offense. However, very few empirical studies support the catharsis effect.  Disinhibition  Disinhibition is that after being repetitive exposed to sexual materials may undermine learned social sanctions against using violence that usually inhibit aggressive behaviors. People may become more aggressive after watching, reading or listening to media violence because they may tend to legitimize using violence in real life. A dozen experimental investigations have explored the disinhibition effects and provided support for this hypothesis.  Imitation  Imitation is explained in terms of social learning theory, which argues that \\"humans have evolved an advanced capacity for observational learning that enables them to expand their knowledge and skills on the basis of information conveyed by modeling influences\\". Social learning explains how observers match the performances of models. Four things must happen before imitation: The first is the attentional process, which people must have seen, read, listened to sexual materials. The second is the retention process, which people can retain some memories of what they have seen, read and listened to. The third is the production process, which the learner must have the capabilities to replicate the action. The fourth is the motivational process, which people must have sufficient desire or will to perform what the violent behavior. Only when all of these four conditions were met, people imitate the performances of actors.  Desensitization  The desensitization effects have been touted by some researchers. The desensitization hypothesis argues that the repeated exposure to sexual violent materials can result in less emotional responsiveness to violence in fiction, news, and reality fare, which could, in turn, result in an increased acceptance of violent behaviors. However, this notion was touted a lot and limited research evidence available supports disinhibition effects.  Mitigating the negative effects  Harris and Barlett concluded that a few studies have developed extensive pre-exposure training and/or post-exposure debriefing procedures to lessen the desensitizing effects. Linz found that by offering pertinent educational information about rape myths reduced the effect of desensitization, which means experimental participation can also help reduce the rape myth acceptance. Wilson, Linz, Donnerstein, and Stipp conducted a field experiment, they found that men who are older than 50 had preexisting attitudes reinforced and actually blamed women for rape after seeing the film. In other words, preexisting attitudes and personal experience should be considered when conducting research studies. Allen, Emmers, Gebhardt, and Giery concluded that experimental studies show positive significant effect between pornography exposure and rape myth acceptance, whereas correlational field studies how a very small effect or nonexistent effect. But the relationship consistently stronger when the sexual materials was violent than it was nonviolent.

Five hypotheses have been proposed to explain infanticide in non-human primates: exploitation, resource competition, parental manipulation, sexual selection, and social pathology.  Hypotheses for infanticide  = Exploitation = A white-fronted capuchin sits in a tree. Cases of infanticide in white fronted capuchins have been attributed to resource competition. Infanticide in non-human primates occurs as a result of exploitation when the individuals enacting the infanticide directly benefit from consumption or use of their victim. The individual can become a resource: food (cannibalism), protective buffer against aggression, or a prop to obtain maternal experience. The form of exploitation in non-human primates most attributable to adult females is when non-lactating females take an infant from its mother (allomothering) and forcibly retain it until starvation. This is known as the \\"aunting to death\\" phenomena; these non-lactating female primates gain mothering-like experience, yet lack the resources to feed the infant. =Resource competition = Resource competition results when there are too few resources in a particular area to support the existing population. In primates, resource competition is a prime motivator for infanticide. Infanticide motivated by resource competition can occur both outside of and within familial groups. Dominant, high ranking, female chimpanzees have been shown to more often aggress towards a lower ranking female and her infant due to resource competition. Primates from outside of familial groups might infiltrate areas and kill infants from other groups to eliminate competition for resources. When resources are limited, infants are easier to eliminate from the competition pool than other group members because they are the most defenseless and thus become targets of infanticide. Primate infanticide motivated by resource competition can also involve cannibalizing the infant as a source of nutrition. Resource competition is also a primary motivator in inter-species infanticide, or the killing of infants from one species by another species. Through eliminating infants of another species in the same environment, the probability that the aggressor and their own infants will obtain more resources increases. This behavior has been an observed consequence of multiple primate inter-species conflicts. In these cases, instances of direct aggression toward inter-specific infants in addition to infanticide have also been observed. In these instances of direct aggression, the aggressor was the previous target of intra-species aggression directed towards them. Therefore, the direct aggression and infanticide carried out by these aggressors could be attributed to re-directed aggression. = Parental manipulation =  Maternal infanticide  Maternal Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by the mother, is rare in non-human primates and has been reported only a handful of times. Maternal infanticide has been reported once in brown mantled tamarins, Saguinus fuscicollis, once in black fronted titis, Callicebus nigrifrons, and four times in mustached tamarins, Saguinus mystax. It is proposed that maternal infanticide occurs when the mother assesses the probability for infant survival based on previous infant deaths. If it is unlikely that the infant will survive, infanticide may occur. This may allow the mother to invest more in her current offspring or future offspring, leading to a greater net reproductive fitness in the mother. Callicebus nigrifrons perched in the trees. Maternal infanticide due to resource competition has been reported in C. nigifrons. In the instances of maternal infanticide in tamarins, there were multiple breeding females. The parental manipulation hypothesis proposes that maternal infanticide occurs more frequently when the group has a poor capacity to raise offspring, multiple breeding females, birth intervals shorter than three months, and low infant survival probability. Maternal infanticide differs from other varieties of infanticide in that the resource competition and sexual selection hypotheses (see other sections) must be rejected. Resource competition and sexual selection are ruled out because it is the mother that is performing the infanticide, not another female. In one case of maternal infanticide in wild black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons), the observed deceased infant was clinically healthy with no signs of health abnormalities. Therefore, infanticide did not appear to occur due to low viability of infant. Additionally, overcrowding or feeding competition were not factors in infanticide. In this case, there were no clear functions of the infanticide; the reason for infanticide in black-fronted titi monkeys is currently unknown. = Sexual selection =  Sexual competition  Infanticide increases a male's reproductive success when he takes over a new troop of females. This behavior has been observed in langurs who live in single male breeding groups. The females whose infants were killed exhibited estrous behavior and copulated with the new leader. These effects result from acceleration of the termination of lactational amenorrhea. This provides an advantage to the male because the female will more quickly copulate with him and raise his young rather than the young from the previous mate; his fitness increases through use of infanticide. Infanticide in one-male breeding units has also been observed in red-tailed monkeys and blue monkeys. In addition to single male breeding groups, sexually selected infanticide often occurs in multi-male, multi-female breeding groups including the red howler and the mantled howler. Adult Japanese macaque males were eight times more likely to attack infants when females had not mated with the male himself. Infanticide by females other than the mother have been observed in wild groups of common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). Most cases of such behavior have been attributed to the resource competition hypothesis, in which females can gain more access to resources for herself and for her young by killing unrelated infants. Although commonly used in the context of food or shelter, the resource competition model can be applied to other limited resources, such as breeding opportunities or access to helpers. Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition. In most observed cases in common marmosets, the socially dominant breeding females killed the infants of a subordinate female, allowing them to maintain their dominance.  Paternal infanticide  Paternal infanticide is rarely observed in non-human primates. In an extensive study of wild Japanese macaques which tracked instances of infanticide, DNA analysis revealed that males would not attack their own offspring or offspring of a female with whom they mated. Further, females in the study were found to be motivated to form social bonds with males in order to protect them from infanticide. = Social pathology: role of social organization = In mammals, interaction between the sexes is usually limited to the female estrous or copulation. However, in non- human primates, these male-female bonds persist past the estrous. Social relationships between males and females in primates are hypothesized to serve as protection against male infanticide. Year-round association serves to lower the probability of infanticide by other males. In addition, many primates live in multi-female groups, and it has been proposed that these females live together to reduce the risk of infanticide through paternity confusion or concealed ovulation. However, complex interactions can arise when females have different social rankings and when resource availability is threatened. Most often, dominant females opportunistically kill the young of a less dominant female when competition arises.  Adaptive counter adaptations to infanticide  Many primate species have developed counter adaptations to reduce the likelihood of infanticide. These strategies include physical defense, paternity confusion, reproduction suppression, and accelerated development. = Physical defense = The most immediate and obvious form of protection against infanticide is physical defense wherein mothers either directly prevent aggressive acts toward their offspring or recruit other individuals for assistance. Female primates have been observed to actively defend territory from potentially infanticidal females, as seen in chimpanzees. In order to recruit the non-parental assistance in defense, female chacma baboons utilize \\"friendships\\" with males, wherein the male forms a bond with the infant until weaning, that may serve to protect their offspring from aggression by higher ranking males or females. A Hanuman langur mother feeding an infant. Female Hanuman langurs are known to utilize paternity confusion through concealed ovulation. To protect their young from infanticide, many species of primate mothers will form social monogamous pairs to prevent paternal infanticide. In these pairs, the males will mate with other females but live exclusively with one female as a socially monogamous pair. Forming this socially monogamous pair causes the males to form parental relationships and social bonds with the female's offspring. These bonds motivate males to defend their offspring against infanticide from unrelated individuals and to never commit infanticide against their own offspring. This form of social monogamy has been observed in gibbons, siamangs, baboons, and macaques. One study demonstrated that for gorillas, living in harem-style groups reduces a female's risk of infanticide more than if she mated with multiple males. A female gorilla benefits more from protection by the silverback male, despite the fact that mating with only one male increased paternity certainty and thus increases the number of males in the population that would benefit reproductively from infanticide. However, it is likely that antipredation is also a closely linked motivation to the formation of gorilla social units. = Paternity confusion = Females utilize paternity confusion to reduce the likelihood that a male she has mated with will kill her offspring. There are several ways this is accomplished including concealed ovulation. Female catarrhine primates such as Hanuman langurs have evolved an extended estrous state with variable ovulation in order to conceal the paternity of the fertilization. Another important situation in which paternity confusion can arise is when females mate with multiple males; this includes mating patterns such as polyandry and promiscuity in multi-male multi-female groups. Similar to promiscuous mating, female primates are proceptive during the first and second trimester of pregnancy in order to increase paternity confusion of their offspring. Finally, in multi-male multi-female groups, female synchrony, in which females are all fertile at the same time, can prohibit the dominant male from monopolizing all of the females. This also allows sneak copulations in which non-dominant males sire offspring. Female synchrony also serves to reduce risk of female infanticide by forcing potentially infanticidal females to focus on provisioning their own infants rather than acting aggressively. But there is some evidence to suggest that female synchrony serves to increase competition pressures and thus aggression in females. = Reproduction suppression = Females may also avoid the costs of continued reproductive investment when infanticide is likely. One such occurrence is known as the Bruce Effect, in which female primates may abort the pregnancy when presented with a new male. This has been observed in wild geladas, where a majority of females abort pregnancies following the displacement of a dominant male. Feticide is a related but distinct phenomenon by which physical or psychological trauma mediated by male behavior results in fetal loss. For example, in baboons at Amboseli, rates of fetal loss increase following the immigration of aggressive males. In some social systems, lower-ranking primate females may delay reproduction to avoid infanticide by dominant females, as seen in common marmosets. In one instance, the dominant marmoset female killed the offspring of a subordinate female. This phenomenon of reproduction suppression is also well observed in tamarins. = Accelerated development = In order to reduce the amount of time that infants are particularly vulnerable to infanticide, females have been shown to wean infants earlier when risk of infanticide is high. For example, female white-headed leaf monkeys were observed to wean their infants significantly more quickly during male takeovers as compared to socially stable periods. Females with infants too young to be weaned left with the old males and returned after their offspring had fully weaned, again after a significantly shorter weaning period than during stable times.

The skirting was a bright yellow, and the engines were quickly nicknamed by the crews as ‚Äúyellow jackets‚Äù. The skirting and cones were later removed due to ease of maintenance, but were renicknamed ‚Äústripes‚Äù because of their small yellow stripe along the side of the engine.

The Colegio de Nuestra Se√±ora de los Infantes (College of Our Lady of the Infants) is a school in the city of Toledo (Castile-La Mancha, Spain). It was founded in the 16th century by Juan Mart√≠nez Sil√≠ceo, Archbishop of Toledo and later a cardinal, and was intended to provide a specialist musical education for the cathedral's young singers. The original building is protected by the heritage listing Bien de Interes Cultural, but the school relocated in the 1980s.  Educational aims  On July 22, 1552, Archbishop Sil√≠ceo founded the College of Our Lady of the Infants, whose purpose would be the integral formation of some children called ‚Äúcleri√ßones‚Äù who sang and helped in the services of Cathedral of Toledo. There are previous news dating back to the 12th century of the services of some children in the Cathedral. On May 9, 1557 the same Cardinal Archbishop signs the Constitutions by which that College will be governed. The Maestro de Capilla, generally, and other teachers lived with the boys to supervise their development, which included, for a time, their incorporation into the Royal University of Toledo.  Architecture  Completed in 1559, the College was the result of the remodeling of an existing property rather than a new building. The irregular plan is imposed by the adjacent streets and results in the building being freestanding. The plan and execution of the work was carried out Don Francisco de Villalpando, also author of the screen of the main presbytery of the Cathedral; and very possibly its main master of works was Alonso de Covarrubias, given the great connection existing between the College and the Cathedral's cabildo.  Alumni  In the 19th century, it was perhaps the most celebrated scholarships, the music master Guillermo Cerceda and Francisco Sanz, singer in the Music Chapel of the Royal Palace of Madrid, both natural of Toledo. In the 20th century, there was the former seise (chorister) and composer Jacinto Guerrero, to whom we are indebted for the music of such zarzuelas as \\"Los Gavilanes\\", El hu√©sped del Sevillano and \\"La rosa del azafr√°n\\". Also it is necessary to emphasize the figure of the former seise Saint Alonso de Orozco, patron of the Seises of Toledo.  Present day  The college still exists as an educational institution, but in another location on Toledo's Avenida de Europa. It has about 1500 students between 1st year of infants and 2nd of baccalaureate.

It is one of five major basins encompassing the entire Sound, and the shallowest basin, with a mean depth of . Exact definitions of the region vary: the state's Department of Fish and Wildlife counts all of Puget Sound south of the Tacoma Narrows for fishing regulatory purposes. The same agency counts Mason, Jefferson, Kitsap, Pierce and Thurston Counties for wildlife management. The state's Department of Ecology defines a similar area south of Colvos Passage. The term \\"South Sound Region\\" or just \\"South Sound\\" is used to apply to the communities surrounding the water. The South Sound contains the Olympia- Tumwater Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Shelton Micropolitan Statistical Area. The terms appear in names of local institutions and commercial entities such as South Puget Sound Community College in Olympia and South Sound Center in Lacey. Human history Archaeology indicates that continuous human occupation began approximately ten thousand years ago by the Salish peoples who still live there. Lieutenant Peter Puget perhaps made first contact with the indigenous peoples and first charted the South Sound in the 1790s, giving rise to the original \\"Puget's Sound\\", which was then just the area south of the Narrows. Fort Nisqually was established in 1832, and Fort Steilacoom became the territorial militia headquarters in August 1849. Both preceded by decades Fort Lewis (now Joint Base Lewis-McChord), which was created for World War I. The Medicine Creek Treaty between the tribes and the United States was signed in 1854 at the Nisqually River delta in the South Sound area, when settlers from other parts of America began to arrive. Olympia became a settlement in the 1840s, providing access to inland areas in Southwest Washington. Tumwater pioneers Michael Simmons, born in Kentucky, and George Washington Bush, a multiracial War of 1812 veteran from Pennsylvania, were among the first Puget Sound settlers from the United States in 1844. Simmons and Bush likely hacked a path through virgin forest from the Oregon Trail. In 1860 the route was made into a military road between Fort Vancouver on the Columbia to Forts Nisqually and Steilacoom on the Sound. The Indian Shaker Church was founded in 1881 at Mud Bay by Native Americans \\"Mud Bay\\" Sam Yowaluch and \\"Mud Bay\\" Louie Yowaluch, and John Slocum of the Squaxin Island Tribe. The church spread throughout the Northwest United States and Southern British Columbia in the 19th century, and still exists . The 20th century was characterized by rapid development and urbanization on the shores of the South Sound. Geography South Puget Sound navigation chart showing shoreline complexity The passages and inlets west of Hartstene Island, due to extensive Pleistocene glaciation, contain the shallowest water of the entire Sound. Away from the Tacoma Narrows, the basin has low rates of tidal exchange (tidal flushing), leading to issues with eutrophication. Shoreline complexity is greater in the South Sound than in the other basins, due to the many passages, inlets and islands: ;Passages *Pickering Passage *Peale Passage *Dana Passage *Squaxin Passage ;Inlets *Hammersley Inlet and Oakland Bay *Totten Inlet **Skookum Inlet *Eld Inlet *Budd Inlet *Henderson Inlet ;Islands *Fox Island *McNeil Island *Anderson Island *Hartstene Island *Steamboat Island =Mudflats= Oyster Bay mudflats Great tidal variation gives rise to extensive mudflats in the inlets of the South Sound. Tidal variation increases with distance from the entrance to Puget Sound and is greatest at 15+ feet in the South Sound, versus only 11 in Seattle (compare 5 in Los Angeles). Mudflats include the Mud Bay region at the southern end of Eld Inlet and Oyster Bay at the southern end of Totten Inlet. The entirety of Oyster Bay is exposed mud at low tide. =Watersheds= Major watersheds in the South Sound include the Deschutes River (Washington) and the Nisqually River. =Microclimate= The Chehalis Gap brings Pacific moist air to the entire Puget Sound area, arriving first in the South Sound (the gap near Matlock is from Shelton on Oakland Bay). Olympia is wetter than Seattle due to the absence of protection from the Olympic Mountains, and has been reckoned the rainiest city in America with 64 days of rain a year.http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/seattle- rainiest-city.htm Aquaculture Aquaculture in the South Sound produces much of the state's commercial shellfish harvest. Oyster farming in Totten Inlet and its side branch, Little Skookum, produce the best known edible oysters in the South Puget Sound. Geoduck production leads the nation. Governments Jurisdictions in the South Sound include the state government and subordinate counties and cities; Nisqually, Squaxin Island, and Puyallup Tribes; and the federal government which is a landowner and operator of Joint Base Lewis- McChord. Transportation Pacific Ocean container ship and crane at Port of Olympia Transportation by water was once common in the South Sound. Ferries once linked many locations such as Steilacoom. The Steilacoom-Anderson Island Ferry provides service between Steilacoom and South Sound islands using two vessels. The north end of the South Sound region has the only cross-Sound bridge, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (technically two adjacent bridges since 2007). Interstate 5 and U.S. 101 form a semicircular pathway from Shelton to Tacoma around the South Sound, and Washington State Route 3 runs up from Shelton through the center of the Kitsap Peninsula. State Route 16 across the Narrows Bridge completes a loop around the South Sound. Dead end county roads traverse the length of the southernmost peninsulas in the Totten Inlet-Eld Inlet-Budd Inlet area: Kamilche Point Road, Steamboat Island Road, Cooper Point Road, Libby Road, and Johnson Point Road. The Port of Olympia is a deepwater port for oceangoing vessels. It is sustained by dredging in Budd Inlet and Capitol Lake, an impoundment of the Deschutes River. Without dredging, the Deschutes would recreate its historical estuary with annual of sediment deposit. Tacoma Rail, BNSF Railway, Union Pacific Railroad support general rail freight, and a little-used, Puget Sound and Pacific Railroad spur to the Kitsap Peninsula exists. Historically, logging railroads such as Mud Bay Logging Company were common on the South Sound shores and inland; these have been abandoned. Sanderson Field in Shelton and Olympia Regional Airport are the only major public airports (see List of airports in Washington). Large military airfields exist onboard Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Marine mammals Gray and humpback whales are rare in the South Sound but have been known to come there to feed and perhaps shelter whale calves. Southern resident killer whales (orcas) have been reported as far south as Eld Inlet. Smaller species include Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides Dalli), harbor seals (Phoca Vitulina) and the Pacific harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). A single sea otter was sighted in the South Sound in 2012.

After moving to Townsville to assist Anglican Bishop, Christopher George Barlow (1858-1915) in his diocese for two years, Buchanan moved to Thursday Island and worked among the multi-racial communities of divers. During the 1890s she worked on Thursday Island and was ordained there as a deaconess in 1908. In the same year she went to Moa Island to conduct the St Paul's Anglican mission and teach school. In 1911 she resigned from her position, due to ill-health, but continued to teach until her return to Brisbane in 1913. She died of tuberculosis at St Helen's Methodist Hospital at South Brisbane. There is some uncertainty about her exact date of death being listed in the Queensland Death Registers as 30 December 1913, but her notices in various newspapers state she died the previous day 29 December 1913. Her funeral was held at St John's Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane on 31 December 1913 and afterwards she was buried in the Toowong Cemetery. On 27 January 1914 at Thursday Island it was decided to raise funds to remember Buchanan who they regarded as a \\"splendid example of self sacrificing devotion\\" with a memorial window in the Quetta Cathedral on Thursday Island and to complete a project important to her, the erection of a hospital at St Paul's Mission on Moa Island. In July 1914 the window was ordered from England. The window was dedicated at the cathedral in November 1915.

Brian Welsh would direct from a script by Alex von Tunzelmann. On 12 February 2016 it was reported that Jonathan Teplitzky would replace Welsh as director. Miranda Richardson and Stanley Tucci would also join the cast as Clementine Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower, respectively. On 28 April 2016, John Slattery replaced Tucci. On 24 May 2016 it was announced that principal photography had begun. Some scenes were shot in Edinburgh and Glasgow; Arniston House was used as film location for many of the scenes between Gen.

Reception On review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 49% based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Churchill gets sterling work out of Brian Cox in the leading role, but it isn't enough to overcome a muddled and ultimately unsuccessful approach to an incredible real- life story.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 44 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Noted Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts gave the film a scathing review, saying that a series of historical errors made Mr. Churchill almost unrecognisable. After praising its acting, photography and music, he wrote that the film failed due to a script filled with blatant errors, grossly mis-characterizing Churchill on numerous points. About the film's author, who, while a historian, is not a WWII scholar, he wrote, \\"The only problem with the movie ‚Äì written by the historian Alex von Tunzelmann ‚Äì is that it gets absolutely everything wrong. Never in the course of movie-making have so many specious errors been made in so long a film by so few writers.\\" His review went into detail on numerous errors, such as the false portrayal of Churchill as anti-American, or claims that he dithered about Operation Overlord (the Normandy landing), or the marital strife with his wife, Clementine. None of these points have a basis in fact, according to Roberts. Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph rated the film 4/5 stars and said that \\"Brian Cox dazzles in a scalpel-sharp, timely lesson in political leadership\\", while Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, noted that \\"Miranda Richardson shrewdly plays Churchill's wife Clemmie: imperious, exasperated, gimlet-eyed\\", and rated the film 3/5 stars. In The Independent rated the film 3/5 stars and wrote \\"There are elements of both King Lear and of Colonel Blimp about Cox's Churchill. Like Blimp, he's a man out of time, accused of trying to fight a modern war with a mindset stuck years in the past. Like Lear, he is an old man, raging against the elements.\\" In Time Out magazine, Tom Huddleston rated the film 3/5 stars and wrote \\"Cox is rudely magnificent, capturing not just the wilfulness of the man but the nagging self-doubt at his inner core.\\" Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, said Brian Cox's performance \\"cannot be faulted.

Background In 1850, John C. Fremont chose the 120th meridian west as California's eastern boundary. However, because no survey had thus far been done, most assumed this line just tracked the crest of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. So too did the citizens. Some believed they were too far east to be a part of California and had thus founded their own state, Nataqua, in 1856. Still others refused to pay taxes to Plumas County officials when they would appear to collect, claiming their land was in Nevada, and when Nevada officials appeared vice versa. However, as the settlement grew in Lake Honey Valley, both California and Nevada saw the lack of taxes in the area as an increasingly unacceptable situation and newer settlers were more sympathetic toward Plumas and California authorities, for need of public school funds and protection against Native Americans. Conflict With overlapping jurisdictions, judges and justices began issuing orders attempting to override the other's elected authority. Hon. John S. Ward, probate judge of Roop County, was first to issue an injunction restraining William J. Young, a justice of the peace for Plumas County, from exercising his official functions. Refusing, he was fined $100 for contempt of court. In retaliation, Hon E. T. Hogan ordered the arrest by two sheriffs of Ward and one other judge from Roop after they continued to exercise jurisdiction over Lake Honey Valley. When the Plumas County sheriff E.H. Pierce and his deputy J.D. Byers arrived, they were at first confronted by the Roop County deputy sheriff, who held in his hand an injunction restraining them. Byers wasted no time snatching it from him, for which he was arrested (and later set free thanks to the sympathy of a local lawyer and the negligence of the judge who didn't sign the warrant) In the end, Pierce and Byers were both successful in their arrests and on their way out of town. However, Deputy Sheriff Byers was late to depart, allowing former Governor Isaac Roop to overtake him. Neither was particularly pleased with the sight of the other and they almost reached a shooting point when Francis Langiar, owner of the property, said (or so he claims), \\"Gentlemen, remember that you are both Masons.\\" With this, Roop allowed Byers up the road, but not long later he was back with seven armed men to capture the deputy (prisoner still in tow) and haul them back to town. Upon hearing the news, Pierce released his prisoner and headed over the summit through the snow and into the American and Indian Valleys where he recruited 93 and 15 men, respectively (though accounts differ on the exact numbers), with which he would return. When he and his men returned to Susanville on Sunday the 14th, they found Roop and 30 men (Pierce falsely believed there to be 100) holed up with 600 shots in an old log house (built by Roop in 1854 to fend off Native Americans) known as Fort Defiance. Roop's Fort Battle Despite warnings from the Honey Lakers that they would be fired upon, the Plumas company began fortifying a barn 150 to 200 yards away with the knowledge that 20 more men were on their way (with a cannon, they later found out). The first shot was fired when Plumas Deputy Sheriff Kellogg and four men left the barn to retrieve a log for reinforcement of the barn. Still not heeding the warnings of the Honey Lakers, one of the men, William Bradford, was hit in the thigh before Kellogg was fired upon five more times trying to rescue him. This set off a four-hour round of volleys back and forth, during which two Honey Lakers were slightly wounded. However, it was evident, according to witnesses, that neither side actually wished to inflict injury. This episode lasted until citizens of the town arrived with a white flag in an effort to negotiate a truce. Aftermath An armistice was hammered out which led to a long-term agreement between Sheriffs Pierce and Naileigh. A committee composed of two citizens from each party would be sent to Governors Leland Stanford and Orion Clemens to make their case. In the meantime, neither county would take jurisdiction over the area. There were no ill-feelings between the men themselves as evidenced by their gathering together to at the local hotel. Later on, the settlement as well as the valley up to the easternmost point of the lake was to be, for the time, was put under Plumas County's control in accordance with De Groote's earlier map. Two surveyors, meanwhile, ran the eastern boundary anew from Lake Tahoe to Oregon, finding all of the settlement and the lake within the limits of California and shrinking Roop so much so that neighboring Washoe County was forced to annex it. In order to resolve any hard feelings still had by some residents of the area who weren't keen on the quasi-annexation into California, the legislature created Lassen County in 1864 with Susanville as its county seat.

She was born in San Francisco, California. Gottlieb's professional career spans more than 50 years. She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia. Lois Davidson was an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright as a part of the Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona, and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to Taliesin East in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948‚Äì1949. Gottlieb co-founded an architectural firm, Duncombe-Davidson, with A. Jane Duncombe, who is also one of the apprentices to Wright's Taliesin at that time. Gottlieb is also a former member of International Archive of Women in Architecture Board of Directors. She died on August 21, 2018 at age 91.  Education  Gottlieb attended Stanford University, where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947. In the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna-Honeycomb House (1936) near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \\"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\\" Driven by the appreciation for, and a desire to learn more about the design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \\"a way of life\\". Gottlieb was one of the few women who have been apprenticed to Frank Lloyd Wright as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the Eric and Pat Pratt Residence, aka the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California. Her book, A Way of Life: An Apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright records the eighteen months that she spent with Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Fellowship in the late 1940s. Upon the completion of Taliesin fellowship, Gottlieb went to Harvard University's School of Design from 1949 to 1950 to continued professional training and eventually received her architecture license.  Family Not only Gottlieb was accomplished as a woman designer in a profession traditionally dominated by men, but also one of the few women to have been apprenticed to Frank Lloyd Wright who succeeded in charting an independent career for herself. And all these was done while raising up two children - Karen Gottlieb and Mark Gottlieb - as well as being involved in her husband 's career as an ethnomusicologist, which included the family living in India and Australia eight times for as much as a year several times.  Designs  Gottlieb had learned at Taliesin that beauty is architecture in a matter of principle that every architect has to discover by himself or herself. As Gottlieb recalled, \\"When I first joined Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Fellowship in 1948, it was winter and Mr. and Mrs. Wright and their group of apprentice were living at the desert camp in Arizona. I arrived with a sleeping bag and baggage, and Mrs. Wright led me into the desert to a tiny, pyramidal tent. She said, 'This is your tent and it is up to you make it beautiful.'\\" Gottlieb believes the apprenticeship with Wright also taught her \\"to be harmonious with nature and to take full advantage pf a beautiful setting.\\" Gottlieb was able to interpret these Wrightian principles in her own practice, as described in her beautifully written theoretical book, Environment and Design in Housing (1968). Gottlieb's first California house: Val-Goeshen, Inverness (1951), Robert S. Gottlieb, San Francisco (1955), and Robert S. Gottlieb, Riverside (1964) - all share reverence for nature nature, careful attention to materials, and celebration of the activities that define the sanctuary of the home, true to Wrightian spirit of an \\"Organic Architecture.\\" [A Way of Life: An Apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright, 12-16] Some of her most distinguished designs are Mackey (1966) and Beals (1967) houses in Riverside, Hansen House (1978) in Seattle, Washington D.C., Lynn House (1980) in Ketchum, Idaho, and the Harrah Energy Efficient House (1981) in Sedona, Arizona.

It was built in Fairfax Station, VA, of recycled materials (such as laminated wood and ice block).

Early life  Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Hurlstone Hardy was born in Sydney, Australia, in 1920 and grew up in Brisbane, Queensland. She was a third-generation scientist ‚Äì the only child of Australian entomologist George Hudleston Hurlstone Hardy and granddaughter of British engineer and amateur entomologist George Hurlstone Hardy. Peggy's father worked in the biology department of the University of Queensland, where he held a Walter and Eliza Hall Fellowship from 1922 to 1932. Peggy's mother, Martha Elizabeth Olive Harris, was a former Tasmanian schoolteacher. Peggy attended Somerville House, where she was dux of the school in 1937, and then enrolled at the University of Queensland in 1938. She took her Bachelor of Science (honours) in zoology and received the gold medal for outstanding merit in 1942. She won the Duncan McNaughton Scholarship in 1940, and was awarded a Walter and Eliza Hall Fellowship in Economic Biology in 1943 after completing her MSc in zoology. Hardy worked at the University of Sydney and at the CSIR McMaster Animal Health Laboratory during her fellowship, studying the heat tolerance, skin, and fibres of sheep. At McMaster, she met Helen Newton Turner, who became a scientific collaborator and lifelong friend.  Career  In 1945, Hardy was appointed assistant research officer at the CSIR after her mentor Harold Burnell Carter challenged arguments that women were \\"a poor investment.\\"Carter, H. B. (2000). \\"A personal memoir of the Australian Merino: Australian sheep & wool research 1932‚Äì1954\\", retrieved 2017-07-04 She went to the University of Cambridge in 1947 and studied at Newnham College, earning her zoology PhD in 1949 under the direction of cell biologist Dame Honor Fell. While still in her 20s, Hardy was the first person in the world to grow hair outside a living organism. After returning to Australia, Hardy became vice principal of the Women's College at the University of Sydney and a member of the board of reference for the Evangelical Union's \\"Mission in the University\\" in 1951. It was in Sydney that Hardy got to know sociologist and poet Harold Fallding,\\"Harold Joseph Fallding,\\" The Globe and Mail, September 17, 2007. who shared her intellectual approach to Christian evangelism. In 1954, future Anglican primate Rev. Marcus Loane officiated at Hardy's marriage to Fallding in the Moore College chapel as she became Margaret Hardy-Fallding. Soon after, Margaret \\"had to slow down on embryonic hair follicle culture because I was culturing an embryonic human.\\"Hardy, M. H. (1998). \\"Why Study Hair Follicles?

She gave birth to three children, all delivered by her friend Margaret Mulvey, dubbed the \\"mother of Australian obstetrics,\\" before returning to a scientific career. In the 1960s, the Falldings moved to North America, where Margaret worked at Columbia University in New York before joining the staff of Canada's Ontario Veterinary College in 1966 as its second female faculty member. There she taught embryology and histology in the University of Guelph's department of biomedical sciences. In both countries, anti-nepotism rules barred her from positions at universities where her husband worked and thus forced her to commute to other cities for more than 30 years. Margaret technically retired in 1985 as professor emeritus, with close to 100 publications on her curriculum vitae, but continued her lab work for another decade.

She was the founder-owner-chef of Hattie's Chicken Shack in Saratoga Springs, New York. Personal Hattie was born Hattie Gray in Saint Francisville, Louisiana, around 1900. Her mother, Lydia, died in childbirth. The wife of a local rabbi, Hattie Leopold, who had employed Lydia took an interest in the child and helped Hattie's father Harry raise her. Hattie was named after Mrs. Leopold. She moved to New Orleans for school, and then to Chicago. In Chicago she went to work as a cook for the family of A.E. Staley, known as \\"The Starch King\\", founder of the corn processing company of the same name. The Staleys owned homes in Chicago, Miami, and Saratoga Springs and when they travelled Hattie accompanied them. Hattie was married twice, first to Willie Moseley, and after his death in 1971 to Bill Austin, She had no children of her own, but took in several needy neighborhood children. Hattie's Chicken Shack Hattie's Chicken Shack, 45 Phila Street, in 2013 In 1938, Moseley Austin decided to settle permanently in Saratoga Springs and opened Hattie's Chicken Shack on Federal Street, a racially mixed neighborhood, with a total investment of $33. Her specialty was a simple fried chicken recipe, although later she added other items of New Orleans cooking such as shrimp, scallops, and barbeque. At this time Saratoga Springs was a \\"wide open\\" town with an active night life‚Äî much of it centered in the Federal Street area. During the summer season Moseley Austin operated her restaurant around the clock, seven days a week. She catered to all classes of people from wealthy gamblers to backstretch workers from the Saratoga Race Course. She was also noted for feeding anyone who was hungry, even if they had no money to pay. Moseley Austin operated the restaurant on Federal Street until 1968, when urban renewal wiped out the entire neighborhood. She then moved to Phila Street, where the restaurant still operates today although Moseley Austin sold it in 1993. See also *A. E.

He studied at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, and Indiana University, while he taught at Samuel Huston College in Austin, Texas, Booker T. Washington High School in Dallas, Claflin College in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Texas Southern University in Houston, Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, and East Texas State University in Commerce, Texas (now Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce). He published numerous collections of folklore and poetry, most notably The Word on the Brazos (1953), Aunt Dicey Tales (1956), Dog Ghosts and Other Texas Negro Folk Tales (1958), and Worser Days and Better Times (1965). Brewer was the first African American to be an active member of the Texas Folklore Society, to be a member of the Texas Institute of Letters, and to serve on the council of the American Folklore Society. He was also the first African American to deliver a lecture series at the University of Arizona, the University of California, and the University of Colorado, and he broke the color barrier at Austin's Driskill Hotel. He has been compared to Zora Neale Hurston, Joel Chandler Harris, and Alain Locke.  Early life  J. Mason Brewer was born on March 24, 1896, in Goliad, Texas. His mother, Minnie T. Brewer, was a public school teacher; his father, J. H. Brewer, worked a variety of jobs, including as a barber, drover, grocer, mail carrier, postmaster, and wagoner. Brewer's four sisters (Gladys, Jewell, Marguerite, and Stella) all became educators (collectively working in Atlanta, Austin, and Houston), while his only brother (Claude) became an interior decorator in Austin. Brewer's father told him Texas stories as a child, while his mother provided him with access to books on African-American history as well as the works of Paul Laurence Dunbar. According to James W. Byrd, as a child Brewer was an \\"avid listener\\" who became an \\"avid reader\\" and ultimately also an \\"avid writer\\". Bruce A. Glasrud and Milton S. Jordan particularly credit his father for Brewer's interest in folklore. Brewer attended public schools in Austin and Fannin, and graduated from high school in 1913 at the age of 17. He then attended Wiley College in Marshall, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1917. Following this, he taught for a year in Austin before joining the American Expeditionary Forces in 1918, serving as a corporal in France, where he worked as an interpreter due to his knowledge of French, Italian, and Spanish. In 1919, Brewer returned from Europe to teach and serve as a principal in Fort Worth, working there in the public schools for five years. In 1924, Brewer moved to Denver to work briefly for the Continental Oil Company. While in Denver, he wrote both poetry and stories for his employer's trade journal as well as for The Negro American. He returned to teaching as a principal in Shreveport, Louisiana, and in 1926 earned a position as a professor at Samuel Huston College in Austin. In the 1930s, he taught English and Spanish at Booker T. Washington High School in Dallas.  Early career  In 1932, while in Austin, Brewer met J. Frank Dobie, then the secretary and editor of the Texas Folklore Society. According to Byrd, Dobie was the \\"biggest influence on [Brewer's] career as a writer\\". Also in 1932, the Society published a collection of African-American folktales collected by Brewer that was entitled \\"Juneteenth\\". He studied folklore formally for the first time at Indiana University, under the direction of Stith Thompson, ultimately earning his Master of Arts degree there in 1933. That same year, he published Negrito: Negro Dialect Poems of the Southwest. In 1936, he wrote The Negro in Texas History for the occasion of the Texas Centennial. After teaching for a year at Claflin College in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Brewer returned to the newly renamed Huston-Tillotson College in 1943 to serve as Chairman of the Department of English Language and Literature, as well as Director of Research. During summers, he also taught at Texas Southern University in Houston. In 1945, Brewer published Humorous Folktales of the South Carolina Negro. The next year he published Mexican Border Ballads and Other Lore, which included his story collection entitled \\"John Tales\\", with the Texas Folklore Society. The \\"John Tales\\" feature the eponymous John, who according to Glasrud and Jordan is \\"the trickster hero of the southern plantation [who] always comes out victorious in his contests with the slave owner or overseer.\\" In 1947, Brewer privately published a volume of works entitled More Truth Than Poetry. With illustrations drawn by H. E. Johnson, Glasrud and Jordan describe this volume of poetry as \\"Brewer at his sardonic best\\".  Middle career and success  In 1951, Brewer was granted an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by Paul Quinn College in Waco, for \\"his unmatched contribution to African American literature and folklore.\\" In 1953, he published The Word on the Brazos: Negro Preacher Tales from the Brazos Bottoms of Texas, through the University of Texas Press; it was \\"widely\\" considered a \\"classic\\", according to Byrd, and Texas historian Walter Prescott Webb referred to it as \\"the best of its sort ever\\". Glasrud and Jordan called it \\"his first major folklore collection\\". Jet magazine named it its Book of the Week on February 11, 1954, noting how Brewer had \\"interviewed old-timers and carefully collected tales which have been handed down for generations.\\" In 1956, Brewer published a limited edition of 400 for his Aunt Dicey Tales, a collection of 14 \\"snuff-dipping tales of the Texas Negro\\". This edition was also well known and well regarded for its crayon drawings by John T. Biggers, with Dobie raving that the \\"tales illustrate the drawings as much as the drawings illustrate the tales\\". In 1958 Brewer published what Byrd considers his \\"third and best\\" of his \\"major volumes\\", Dog Ghosts and Other Texas Negro Folk Tales; of its 63 stories, only 9 are ghost stories involving dog ghosts. Glasrud and Jordan called it \\"a rich and delightful trove of stories\\". Brewer began his tenure as a professor of English at Livingstone College in Salisbury, North Carolina, in 1959. After moving to North Carolina, Brewer's most significant publications were the articles \\"Animal Tales as Told by African Students of Livingstone College\\" and \\"North Carolina Negro Oral Narratives\\" (both published in the journal North Carolina Folklore) and two books, Three Looks and Some Peeps (1963) and Worser Days and Better Times (1965).  Later career  In 1969, Brewer published a \\"well-received\\" collection of stories entitled American Negro Folklore through Quadrangle Books and the New York Times Book Company. That same year, he took a position as Visiting Distinguished Professor at East Texas State University (ETSU) in Commerce, Texas (now Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce), where he taught until his death in 1975. While at ETSU, he organized symposia and workshops in addition to teaching classes, which he occasionally lectured in verse, while also turning his major research focus to African influences on Mexican folklore. He was the first African American professor in ETSU's English Department, and was hired only one year after David Talbot became the university's first African American professor. In 1972, Brewer wrote the introduction to Henry D. Spalding's Encyclopedia of Black Folklore and Humor, as well as the 80-page chapter \\"Plantation to Emancipation\\". Spalding introduced Brewer's chapter by calling Brewer \\"the nation's most illustrious black folklorist\\". By the end of his career, Brewer had received research grants for his work in African American folklore from the American Philosophical Society, the Library of Congress, the National Library of Mexico, the National University of Mexico, and Piedmont University's Center for the Study of Negro Folklore.  Personal life  Brewer identified as a Methodist and a member of the Democratic Party. He married twice, and had a son with his first wife; his second wife, Ruth Helen, was from Hitchcock, Texas. After his death, he was buried in Austin.  Legacy  Brewer was the first African American to be an active member of the Texas Folklore Society, to be a member of the Texas Institute of Letters, and to serve on the council of the American Folklore Society, where he rose to the position of vice- president. He was also the first African American to deliver a lecture series at the University of Arizona, the University of California, and the University of Colorado. Additionally, he broke the color barrier at Austin's Driskill Hotel when he was inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters. Geneva Smitherman called Brewer \\"America's most distinguished Negro folklorist\\", Charles Leland Sonnichsen called him the \\"premier collector of Negro folklore in Texas\\", while Alan Dundes referred to him as \\"one of the few professionally trained Negro folklorists\\". Humanities Texas argued that he \\"almost single- handedly preserved the African American folklore of his home state.\\" Brewer is often compared with Floridian Zora Neale Hurston because, in the words of Byrd, \\"they were both successful in collecting and publishing Negro folklore.\\" He has also been compared to Joel Chandler Harris due to both his subject matter and the \\"extended use of Negro dialect\\" in his writings. He has additionally been compared to Alain Locke, although Brewer himself criticized the Harlem Renaissance as \\"unrepresentative\\" of the African American experience. Byrd considers Brewer's best long works, in order of publication, to be The Word on the Brazos, Aunt Dicy Tales, Dog Ghosts, and Worser Days and Better Times. Byrd also emphasized the importance of humor in the stories Brewer collected. According to Texas scholar Michael Phillips, themes prevalent in Brewer's stories include \\"intelligence winning over brute force\\" and \\"a defiant attitude toward white America\\". A 1969 interview with Brewer is featured in the Oral History Collection at Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection. In 1997, Brewer was posthumously given the Compa√±ero/a de las Americas award by the American Folklore Society for his \\"outstanding contributions to the further understanding of folk traditions in the Americas and the Caribbean\\" at the same ceremony at which his friend Am√©rico Paredes was likewise honored. In 1999, the University of Texas at Austin's Harry Ransom Center held an exhibition on Aunt Dicy Tales that prominently featured the illustrations created by John Biggers. In January 2017, Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce held a J. Mason Brewer Day featuring Brewer scholars Bruce Glasrud and Milton Jordan as well as a panel discussion involving his former colleagues and students. Brewer described his tales in Dog Ghosts in his own words as \\"as varied as the Texas landscape, as full of contrasts as Texas weather. Among them are tales that have their roots deeply embedded in African, Irish, and Welsh mythology; other have parallels in pre-Columbian Mexican traditions; and a few have versions that can be traced back to Chaucer's England.\\"  Bibliography  = Books =      *  Negro Heritage Series   = Articles = * Brewer, J.

History  Watson branded the name \\"Beef Trust\\" to represent a burlesque act featuring large beautiful women ( \\"Three Tons of Women\\") who performed in his burlesque musical revues. The act became nationally known as \\"Billy Watson's 'Beef Trust.'\\" The phrase \\"Beef Trust,\\" in burlesque, was exclusive to Watson's shows; and the phrase ‚Äì in connection with Watson's shows ‚Äì was not pejorative. That is, the phrase was \\"founded on a belief that beauty was based on plumpness.\\" Watson conceived and introduced the \\"Beef Trust\\" show in an era that followed a sobering reality encapsulated in a 1906 novel, The Jungle ‚Äì Upton Sinclair's expos√© of the Chicago stockyards, which followed a 1905 Supreme Court decision in favor of the U.S. Government ‚Äì re: Swift & Co. v. United States ‚Äì a decision that destroyed a monopolistic consortium (or syndicate) of large meatpacking concerns, led by the \\"Big Six\\" (Swift, Armour, Morris, Cudahy, Wilson, and Schwartzchild), known as a Beef Trust. Krausemeyer's Alley Watson debuted his Beef Trust act ‚Äì \\"a chorus of thirty of the largest women ever seen on stage\\" ‚Äì May 17, 1909, at the Bijou Theatre, Philadelphia, as an addition to his popular three-act vaudeville skit, Krausemeyer's Alley ‚Äì a comedy that he had been producing, in various renditions, since 1903, when he introduced it with another of his popular skits, Life in Japan. The play was originally in two acts: 1. \\"Krausemeyer's Alley\\" 2. \\"Krausemeyer's Christening\\" Billy Watson's Chicken Trust From about 1916 to about 1928, Watson produced the \\"Chicken Trust,\\" a chorus line composed thin and reportedly beautiful women. They toured with his show on the Mutual Burlesque circuit. Watson's legacy in burlesque With respect to Watson's legacy in the world of burlesque, specifically his drawing power, Sime Silverman, founding editor of Variety magazine, declared him a burlesque institution ‚Äì one that \\"must be accepted as a foundation of the Western Burlesque Wheel,\\" which was also known as the \\"Empire Burlesque Circuit,\\" of which, Watson was part owner. Common confusion with another Billy Watson Billy Watson of this article is not to be confused with Sliding Billy Watson (n√© William Shapiro; 1876‚Äì1939), a popular vaudeville comedian. Coates and Grundy's Watermelon Trust At least one other notable vaudevillian show, that of Coates and Grundy, used the \\"trust\\" concept; : Coates and Grundy \\"Watermelon Trust,\\" which ran from about 1900 to 1914. It started as one of two skits in a show the other skit being the \\"Kissing Trust.\\" The show was part of a three-day engagement at the Academy of Music in Wilmington, Delaware, October 15, 16, and 17, 1900, featuring James Grundy, Susie Grundy, Sherman Coates, Lulu Coates, and Tenny Russell. The show was put on by Matt Flynn's Big Sensation Burlesque Company. The two skits featured James Grundy, Susie Grundy, Sherman Coates (billed as Thomas Coates), Lulu Coates, and Tenny Russell. \\"The Watermelon Trust\\" is also the name of a popular American song composed by Harry C. Thompson, who dedicated it to Coates and Grundy. Thompson composed it in the style of a slow drag. The song was copyrighted in 1906 and published by Barron & Thompson Co., a New York music publishing firm of Ted S. Barron (n√© Theodore S. Barron; 1879‚Äì1943) and the composer, Harry Chester Thompson (1876‚Äì1947).  Historical context of the phrase  Prevalent sometime in the mid-1880s, industry trusts, in the United States ‚Äì roughly described as unincorporated consortiums; that is, trusts composed of powerful industry concerns ‚Äì colluded in large-scale market manipulation schemes that were deemed to be anti-competitive (, injurious to the public). To stem this practice, a landmark Federal statute, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was passed by the 51st Congress in 1890. Billy Watson's \\"Beef Trust\\" burlesque was not technically a trust. Rather, it was a contemporaneous phrase, a double entendred satirical word play that essentially branded a popular segment of Watson's production that featured large, beautiful women. However, there were trusts within the theater industry. York University theater scholar Marlis Schweitzer in her 2015 book, Transatlantic Broadway: The Infrastructural Politics of Global Performance, highlights examples of vaudeville trusts across Europe and the U.S. ( 1897). Schweitzer states that, \\"The formation of syndicates and trusts across various sectors of the theater industry sparked protests among theater artists, journalists, and rival managers.\\" Syndicates and trusts in the theater industry at the turn of the 20th-century should not be confused with the United Kingdom's Theatres Trust, a national initiative enacted in 1976 to protect and promote theatre.

The gun was actually 66 mm, but the classification system for artillery rounded up to the next highest centimeter. The 7 cm K10 was also used by the Italian Navy on ships ceded as war reparations and as coastal artillery during World War II. The Italians referred to it as the 66/47.In Italian nomenclature the first number indicates the caliber expressed in millimeters, the second the length in calibers. This second value is not 50 calibers because the Italians calculated the length of the barrel excluding the firing chamber.  Construction  The ≈†koda 7 cm K10 was developed and built by ≈†koda at the Pilsen works. The barrel was made of steel with a horizontal sliding breech block and used fixed quick fire ammunition. The ≈†koda 7 cm K10 was mainly used for anti-torpedo boat defense and the guns had an elevation of -10¬∞ to +20¬∞. In 1915 Skoda engineers developed an anti-aircraft mounting for the K10 which was called the ≈†koda 7 cm K16 BAG (BAG = Ballon-Abwehr Geschutze or anti-balloon gun) which could elevate from -6¬∞ to +90¬∞ and had the same ballistic performance as the K10.  History  The ≈†koda 7 cm K10 and K16 were mounted aboard battleships, coastal defence ships and cruisers of the Austro-Hungarian Navy as secondary or tertiary armament. The Italians came into possession of a number of these guns through ships ceded to them as war reparations. The French Navy also came into possession of a number of these guns through ships ceded to them as war reparations, but there is not much evidence that they used them afterwards. * Tegetthoff class ‚Äì The 7 cm K10 and K16 were mounted as tertiary armament on these four Dreadnoughts. Each ship had twelve K10 guns on open pivot mounts on the upper deck, above the casemates mainly for anti-torpedo boat defense. There were another three or four (depending on ship) K16 anti-aircraft mounts on top of the 'B' and 'X' turrets after a 1915‚Äì16 refit. After World War I the three surviving ships of the Teggethoff class were ceded as war reparations to the allies. SMS Viribus Unitis went to Yugoslavia, SMS Prinz Eugen went to France and SMS Tegetthoff went to Italy. The Tegetthoff was decommissioned in 1923 and scrapped in 1925. * Radetzky class ‚Äì The 7 cm K16 was mounted as tertiary armament on these three Semi-dreadnoughts. Each ship had four open pivot mounts for anti-aircraft defense after a 1916‚Äì17 refit.

SMiLE-seq works by loading in vitro transcribed and translated ‚Äúbait‚Äù transcription factors into a microfluidic device in combination with DNA molecules. Bound transcription factor-DNA complexes are then isolated from the device, which is followed by sequencing and sequence data analysis to characterize binding motifs. Specialized software is used to determine the DNA binding properties of monomeric or dimeric transcription factors to help predict their in vivo DNA binding activity. SMiLE-seq combines three critical functions that makes it unique from existing techniques: (1) the use of capillary pumps to optimize the loading of samples, (2) trapping molecular interactions on the surface of the microfluidic device through immunocapture of target transcription factors, (3) enabling the selection of DNA that is specifically bound to transcription factors from a pool of random DNA sequences. Background Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms used to govern essential cellular processes is one of the most intensely studied branches of science. Cellular regulatory networks can be incredibly complex, and often involve the coordination of multiple processes that begin with the modulation of gene expression. The binding of transcription factor molecules to DNA, either alone or in combination with other transcription factors, is used to control gene expression in response to both intra- and extracellular stimuli. Characterizing the binding mechanisms and specificities of transcription factors to specific regions of DNA ‚Äì and identifying these transcription factors ‚Äì is a fundamental component of the process of resolving cellular regulatory dynamics. Before the introduction of SMiLE-seq technology, ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) and HT-SELEX (high throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) technologies were used to successfully characterize nearly 500 transcription factor-DNA binding interactions. ChIP-seq uses immunoprecipitation to isolate specific transcription factors bound to DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitation is followed by DNA sequencing, which identifies the genomic regions to which transcription factors bind. HT-SELEX, a similar method, uses random, synthetically generated DNA molecules as bait for transcription factors in vitro. Sequence preferences and binding affinities are characterized based on successful binding interactions between bait molecules and transcription factors. While many unique transcription factor- DNA binding interactions have been characterized using these methods, it is estimated that this described fraction represents fewer than 50% of the transcription factors present in humans. The development of SMiLE-seq technology has provided an attractive alternative method with the potential to facilitate identification and characterization of previously undescribed transcription factor-DNA binding interactions. Workflow of SMiLE-seq SMiLE-seq workflow SMiLE-seq uses a microfluidic device into which transcription factors, which have been transcribed and translated in vitro, are loaded. Transcription factor samples (~0.3 ng) are modified by the addition of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tag and combined with both target double-stranded DNA molecules (~8 pmol) tagged with Cyanine Dye5 (Cy5) and a double-stranded competitive DNA model, poly-dIdC, which operates as a negative control to limit spurious binding interactions. When multiple transcription factors are simultaneously analyzed (e.g., when characterization of potential heterodimeric binding interactions is performed), each transcription factor is tagged with a correspondingly unique fluorescent tag. Samples are pumped through the microfluidic device in a passive, twenty-minute process that utilizes capillary action in a series of parallel channels. eGFP- tagged transcription factors are immunocaptured using anchored biotinylated anti-eGFP antibodies. Mechanical depression of a button traps bound transcription factor-DNA complexes, and fluorescent analysis is performed. Fluorescent readouts that identify the presence of multiple fluorescent tags associated with a single antibody indicate heterodimeric binding interactions. The presence of DNA is confirmed by Cy5 signal detection. A polydimethylsiloxane membrane on the button surface captures successfully bound transcription factor-DNA complexes, while unbound transcription factors and targets are washed away. Following the removal of unbound components, bound DNA molecules are collected, pooled, and amplified. Sequencing is subsequently performed using NextSeq 500 or HiSeq2000 sequencing lanes. Sequence data is used to develop a seed sequence, which is then probed for functional motifs using a uniquely developed hidden Markov model-based software pipeline. Advantages The use of microfluidics in SMiLE-seq offers three main advantages when compared to current techniques used to measure protein-DNA interactions (e.g., ChIP-seq, HT-SELEX, and protein binding microarrays). Firstly, it requires fewer transcription factors than other similar techniques (only picograms are required). Secondly, the process is much faster than other techniques (it requires less than an hour, as compared to days). Lastly, SMiLE-seq is not limited by the length of target DNA (a limitation of protein binding microarrays), and is not biased towards stronger affinity protein-DNA interactions (a major limitation of HT-SELEX). Existing technologies have been found to be laborious and technically complex due to improper transcription factor expression or loss of transcription factor-DNA binding properties in vitro. The ability of many transcription factors to bind DNA is dependent on heterodimer formation, and therefore requires the presence of a specific dimer partner for binding. This has been shown to yield incomplete results if transcription factors are individually tested. Heterodimer combinations have been shown to range from 3000 to 25000, and many remain uncharacterized. A technology like SMiLE-seq, which is able to detect these dimeric interactions, is essential to broaden current knowledge and characterization of transcription factor-DNA binding profiles. Additionally, previous technologies have used transcription factor probes in their truncated form, which may reduce their ability to bind and dimerize. SMiLE-seq enables robust identification of DNA binding specificities of full length, previously uncharacterized transcription factors. Furthermore, SMiLE-seq is able to identify transcription factor binding sites over a wide range of binding affinities, which represents a significant limitation of other technologies. In theory SMiLE-seq is not limited to only protein-DNA interactions and may potentially be utilized to study protein-RNA binding properties once the technology has been developed further. Limitations The primary limitation of SMiLE-seq is that the technique can only be used to characterize the binding interactions of previously identified transcription factors, as the method requires in vitro transcription and translation of the transcription factors prior to their combination with DNA molecules. Additionally, previous studies have shown that fluorescent protein tags can affect the binding affinity of proteins to their targets. The effect of the specific fluorescent protein tags on binding affinity would have to be investigated to determine whether this would impact specific protein-DNA interactions found using this technology. Further development of SMiLE-seq may involve modifying transcription factor expression conditions to increase the success of analysis.

He was an influential pastor in the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia and the Hampton Roads area of Virginia known for his public service and who served as the Commissioner of Ecclesiastical Services and the Former Adjutant General of the COGIC denomination from 2001 until his death in 2012. Thoroughgood, with serving in the capacity of Commissioner of Ecclesiastical Services, had the responsibilities of being the international chief minister of formal religious and civil protocol for the COGIC denomination, being the chief of security for COGIC clergy at COGIC's national conventions, supervising and overseeing the installation and ordination of bishops, and overseeing public relations for the denomination. He was the fifth person appointed to this office of Adjutant General in 2000 by Bishop Chandler David Owens. He was the first person consecrated to the office of Adjutant Bishop in 2001 by then-Presiding Bishop Gilbert Earl Patterson. He was appointed to the position of Commissioner of Ecclesiastical Services in 2008 by current Presiding Bishop, Bishop Charles E. Blake. He was succeeded by Bishop Matthew Williams of Orlando, FL.  Biography  = Early life and education = Thoroughgood was born November 7, 1949 in Princess Anne County in Virginia Beach, Virginia to COGIC pastor, Elder John Thomas Thoroughgood and Mildred B. Cooper Thoroughgood. Thoroughgood received his formal primary and secondary education through the Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach Public School System. He graduated from Union Kempsville High School in 1967. He attended Princess Anne Business College, 1968 - 1969 studying Standard Accounting and Business Management. He received a certificate of completion in Pastoral Counseling and Clinical Psychology from the Boston University, School of Theology, 1973‚Äì74; an Honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree from Trinity Hall College and Seminary, Springfield, Illinois, 1974; Certificate of Completion in Urban Ministries, CAUSA International Seminary, Atlanta, Georgia, 1985; Certificate of Completion in American, Israel, the Middle East's Relations and Continued Studies in Comparative Religion, Jerusalem Institute and Ben Goreum University, Israel and Project Interchange an Institute of the American Jewish Committee, Washington, D. C.; Norfolk Seminary and College, Norfolk, Virginia, Bachelor of Arts, 1995; and an Honorary Doctor of Ministry and a Masters of Divinity in 2000. Thoroughgood married Virginia Beach native, Ernestine Coston in 1975. They had two sons, Emmanuel, and Jonathan, and one daughter, Mekia Bonita. = Ministry = Thoroughgood was converted as a Christian believer in 1956 under the ministries of the late Pastor Joseph Rome Spence and Elder John Thoroughgood. He received the Baptism in the Holy Ghost as a Pentecostal in 1960 and was licensed as a minister in 1966. The late Bishop David C. Love, the Bishop of the First Jurisdiction of Virginia, ordained him an Elder in the Church of God in Christ in 1968. In 1970, Bishop Thoroughgood founded the New Jerusalem Church of God in Christ with two members, now currently a 1,000 member church in Southeastern Virginia Beach in the historic African-American Seatack community and was officially appointed pastor by Bishop David C. Love in 1972. In 1973, New Jerusalem moved from the Virginia First Jurisdiction to the Virginia Second Jurisdiction under the leadership of Bishop Samuel L. Green, Jr. Bishop Thoroughgood was appointed District Superintendent of the Virginia Beach District of the Church of God in Christ, Virginia Second Jurisdiction, in August 1973. In 1978, Thoroughgood was appointed to serve as a National Adjutant for then-Presiding Bishop J.O. Patterson, Sr. and was later appointed by the Bishop J. Delano Ellis as a Divisional Overseer. In 1990, he was appointed Assistant Chief Adjutant by the Bishop H. J. Bell and in 1997 was appointed Assistant Adjutant General by then-Presiding Bishop Chandler D. Owens. He was later appointed by the former Presiding Bishop C. D. Owens as Adjutant General, July 2000. He was elevated to the Office of Adjutant Bishop and Adjutant General on September 15, 2001 by Bishop Gilbert E. Patterson. Thoroughgood was very well known for his baritone voice and his very exuberant and charismatic style of preaching, which attracted many people to his church, New Jerusalem COGIC, in Virginia Beach, including native Virginia celebrities like Pharrell Williams, Timbaland and Missy Elliott (Portsmouth). Timbaland and several members of his family considered themselves \\"honorary members\\" of his church. = Public Service = Thoroughgood was renowned for his Christian public service and missions work he did through his local church for the historic African American community, Seatack, Virginia where New Jerusalem is located. He and his church partnered with numerous other local pastors and churches in Virginia, including Bishop Ted Thomas, Sr., Bishop Courtney Macbeth, and Bishop Levi Willis, Sr. and Willis, Jr., and Bishop Samuel L. Green, Jr. on various occasion to organize many community service initiatives and events throughout Seatack to help raise funds for local charities and in 2001 to build a multipurpose help center to reach out to the poor and homeless of the Seatack community. He also partnered with Timbaland on various occasion throughout 2001 to 2008 to help organize special dinners and cookouts for the Seatack community, held at his church, especially on Labor Day, to help give out school supplies to local Seatack children, feed the homeless, and provide general community service opportunities to adults and children throughout the Seatack community. His church, New Jerusalem COGIC, still continues to annually host an \\"Labor Day Picnic and Cookout.\\" Timbaland also, in turn, donated to his ministries to help him renovate his church and expand the church edifice into the large church building that it is today. He also used much of the funds donated to his church to help partner with local Virginia nonprofit affordable housing and philanthropy organizations such as Habitats for Humanity to help build homes for the homeless of the Seatack local community, and allowed the church to provide for the finances of the housing until they were paid off. Nationally with the COGIC denomination, Thoroughgood also served as National Regional Representative for Area Eight for the COGIC International Missions Department. He served as Chairman of Special Projects and Sponsorship for the Church of God in Christ Orphanage for Girls in Port-au-Prince, Haiti in the West Indies, with which he dedicated much international community service work and leadership to the development of the orphanage. Thoroughgood also served as a member of the Virginia Beach Clergy Association and the Virginia Beach Ministerial Alliance. He was the founding bishop of the Hampton Roads Ecumenical Council of Bishops. He was very active in the community as evident by the following awards: the Regional Postmaster General for the National Postal Forum East; American Legion‚Äôs Distinguished Achievement Award; United Counsel of Citizens and Civic Leagues Award for Meritorious Services; Church Of God In Christ Religious Worker‚Äôs Guild Inc. special achievement Award; Virginia Beach Planning Commission for Distinguished and Faithful Services; South Eastern Tidewater Opportunity Project‚Äôs Black and White Award for Outstanding Service to the Humanities; Congressional Recognition for outstanding invaluable service to the community, the United States Congress; Coalition of Minority Civic Leagues Black History Maker of Virginia; and many other resolutions, Certificates, Trophies, Awards and proclamations for outstanding services to the City of Virginia Beach. = Death = Thoroughgood suffered from cardiovascular disease in the later part of his life. He died from a heart attack, as an indirect cause of congestive heart failure, on February 5, 2012 while preaching in the pulpit of his local church New Jerusalem. A Two-Day (Local/Jurisdiction and National) Homegoing and Funeral Celebration was held for him at the New Jerusalem COGIC and at the Virginia Beach Convention Center. The eulogy at the local service was delivered by the late Bishop Samuel L. Green, Jr. at New Jerusalem. The eulogy at the National Homegoing service was preached by Bishop Charles E. Blake, the Presiding Bishop of the Church of God in Christ at the Virginia Beach Convention Center. Many local and state political officials attended both homegoing services including Scott Riggell, Will Sessoms, former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell, and late Virginia Beach Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf. Thoroughgood was succeeded as Adjutant General of COGIC by Bishop Matthew Williams of Orlando, Florida, and was succeeded by his nephew who was also a COGIC Minister and Pastor, Elder Adam Thoroughgood as the Pastor of New Jerusalem. Pastor Adam Thoroughgood later died on April 21, 2015 in a tragic accident on a tractor on an industrial farm in rural Suffolk, Virginia, where he had worked for several years. He was succeeded by Bishop Barnett Thoroughgood's brother, Superintendent YD Thoroughgood, who was the current pastor of New Jerusalem, until his death on June 9, 2018. The current pastor of the church is one of his nephews, Pastor Waddee B. Thoroughgood, Jr., the son of the above mentioned Pastor YD Thoroughgood.

She operated the largest private dressmaking establishment in colonial Brisbane.  Early life  Janet was born at Neilston, Renfrewshire, Scotland on 10 June 1850, the daughter of Andrew and Jane (n√©e Gemmell) Robertson. In 1863 the family migrated to Queensland, Australia. Janet Walker began her working life as a teacher at Brisbane Girls Normal School in 1872. In 1875 ‚ÄòJessie‚Äô was transferred to the New West End State School to the head girls‚Äô department. During her time in this department the district inspector for the Board of Education, Gerard Anderson, described her as \\"a lively, energetic and intelligent person, with very good ideas of school-keeping‚Ä¶ The pupil teachers are far behind her in animation.\\" She then later resigned from this job on 31 December 1876. From the period of 1876 to 1882 she enjoyed her married life and motherhood before returning to work.  Dressmaking career  After marrying James Laughland Walker, a Scottish-born draper, she operated a dressmaking business at several locations in Brisbane with her first premises located in Queen Street, Brisbane in 1882. Walker later established the \\"Ladies Emporium\\" in Adelaide Street, Brisbane in partnership with Brisbane milliner, Margaret Caldwell. Walker's designs were known for attention to detail, use of luxurious fabrics and high quality finishing touches and were worn by prominent Queensland women to numerous receptions, weddings, balls and other events. Two years from the start of the business, a female journalist from the Queenslander visited her store and wrote a review which made her business better known to the public. As well as the female journalist, her colleagues also joined her to review the rooms, their names were Miss Margaret Caldwell and Miss Margaret Scott. In 1886 Janet then decided to expand on the shop and move to a larger premise on Adelaide Street. From 1887 to 1901 the local press acknowledged Janet‚Äôs designs of eighty-four wedding dresses, fourteen ball gowns and six receptions, and described thirty sets of trousseau garments made in her studio. It was said that her clients were included as one of the most well-known ladies in society of the time. If you were seen wearing a gown by Walker, then this reflected her skills as a designer and her high standard of workmanship. After a while of having a larger premises Janet then decided to downsize her studio back down in 1918 where she moved back to Queen Street. She ran and operated the largest private dressmaking establishment in colonial Brisbane. During the year of 1898 she employed over 120 staff members with most of them working in her studio. Throughout this time, she didn‚Äôt pay any of her apprentices during their first year, but also didn‚Äôt expect any of them to work overtime during this period. The rest of her employees however were paid but only minimum wage with the included overtime and bonus pay during busy periods. To ensure the success of her business, she made sure that her staff were very well trained, and this then resulted in several of her staff carrying on to create and set up their own businesses. Margaret Caldwell became Walker‚Äôs partner, where they were then able to match competitive services offered by larger drapery stores. This was done by opening a ‚ÄòLadies‚Äô Emporium‚Äô in September 1896. The business grew and became so successful that the partners were able to remodel the emporium three times before 1900. In 1897 a showroom was created on the ground level of the courier building in both Queen Street and Edward Street. The partners, Walker and Caldwell, decided that they would offer two services to the ladies of society. These were made to measure garments and ready-made garments. In order to make sure that the products were individual to the company, most of the fabrics were imported in full dress lengths with minimal amounts of lace and trimmings to embellish the garments but just enough to complete the product fully. The business became highly successful with a growing rate of large mail orders from clientele that was established in rural Queensland and New South Wales. As the business grew the company got bigger and bigger with notable recognition from royalty which gave the partners the chance to make several gowns that would be worn to the opening of the Common Wealth Parliament in Melbourne 1901 and the reception at government house, Brisbane, for the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. These garments were so special that they were then made into a feature in her new workrooms. In addition to being a respected and well-known designer and dressmaker, Walker was also an innovative business woman. In 1895 Walker applied for a patent for a folding apparatus, designed to assist with folding woven fabrics, and in 1904 invented an improved dress stand for use in dressmaking. This design was known as the 'plastic bust' and was described as a \\"unique invention\\" which reproduced the \\"customer's exact figure, saves fitting, insures perfect work.\\" This improved her dressmaking skills as Walker was able to make sure that her measurements were fully correct for her client throughout the dressmaking stages. The design of the new and improved dressmakers stand was then sold to the House of Worth, also Madame Paquin in Paris and then to the House of Redfern in London. 1905 was the year the Walker successfully floated the Plastic Bust Co. whilst she was in London. Janet Walker kept the business going and ran it up until 1938 where she retired being a talented and highly skilled costumier.  Later life  She died on 27 November 1940 at Toowong and is buried with her family in South Brisbane Cemetery Only one of her children outlived her. To this day some of her gowns are held in the Queensland museum in Brisbane.

In 1965, elections were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including fifteen city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. Background There was a rift within the Citizens' Association over their selected candidate for the mayoralty, Matt Benney. Benney was a first term councillor and formerly a reputable civil servant, serving as Under-secretary for Mines from 1940 until he retired in 1959. Benney was chosen as the Citizens' nominee for the mayoralty by the association's executive, but he withdrew his nomination after it became clear that a sizeable majority of sitting Citizens' councillors instead favoured deputy-mayor Denis McGrath. However McGrath declined to stand for mayor and offered himself only for the council. As the deadline for nominations neared a deputation of over 50 businessmen and Citizens' candidates asked Benney to again accept both the nomination and deputy-mayoralty, to which he agreed. Kitts attracted criticism for insisting on standing for the council as well as the mayoralty. He had done so in the previous five elections (winning the mayoralty in the last three) but with both his large majority in the previous election combined with the frictions within the Citizens' Association, Kitts was expected to win the mayoralty comfortably. Labour supporters thought he should make way for another candidate on the council ticket and reduce the amount of wasted votes that would be caused on an inevitable dual election. The Labour Party duly won more votes than the Citizens' Association for the council, including over 18,000 for Kitts, though this only translated into one extra council seat, still leaving the council with a Citizens' majority.

Like 1998's Puzzle Link, to which it is the direct sequel, Puzzle Link 2 was developed by Yumekobo and published by SNK.  Gameplay  Just like its predecessor, Puzzle Link 2 is a tile-matching game in which the player must clear away blocks which occupy some of a 9x10 block grid. New to the sequel, there are three tile skins that the player can choose for the standard blocks (a default set styled like the symbols for the French suits in a deck of playing cards; the set of shapes used for the blocks in the first game; and a set resembling small rounded creatures with eyes). Puzzle Link 2 once again features the Normal (now called 'Card Game'), Clear (now called 'All Clear'), and Battle modes from the original. Puzzle Link 2 also features two new modes: an Endless mode and a Card mode. = Card Game = While All Clear and Battle are functionally identical to their iterations from the original, the Card Game (i.e. Normal mode) campaign is structured somewhat differently. Rather than a linear progression like in its predecessor, Puzzle Link 2's primary campaign features 50 rounds evenly split among five levels, any of which the player can access immediately, and a further 10 rounds in a final level that unlocks after beating the other five. This makes for a total of 60 rounds in Puzzle Link 2's entire campaign, compared to 46 in Puzzle Link's campaign. Also unlike the original, Puzzle Link 2 features minor thematic elements conveyed through short cutscenes‚Äîall centering around the protagonist (Ace) acquiring collectible cards from other characters. Further differences from the campaign of Puzzle Link include the addition of a gameplay tutorial and the removal of difficulty options. Three visual differences from the original are visible here: the changed sidebar character, the changed card timer, and the new card- suit-themed block skins.The gameplay screen features two noticeable visual differences from the original. First, rather than the sidebar character being the animal-like sidekick character Moomy as in the original, the sidebar sprite portrait now depicts the protagonist Ace. And second, the timer, which determines whether or not a player unlocks an in-game collectible card in a given round, has changed from a rounded hourglass into a horizontal bar with the letter 'c' next to it. There is also an alteration to the primary gameplay and controls: the player can now manually advance the blocks down the screen in order to heighten the difficulty and pace of a level, and thereby increase the likelihood that they will acquire a card. = Endless = Endless mode features a continuous stream of randomized blocks with no level-ending 'c' blocks. This stream of play continues indefinitely and periodically speeds up until the player fails. The player can choose to play this mode with two, three, or four block types prior to beginning. The sidebar of this mode features a charge meter for a power-up that is only featured in Endless. Once fully charged, the power-up allows the player to fire three shots which clear every visible block of the type hit by the shot. = Card = Puzzle Link 2 maintains the presence of in-game collectible cards from the first game, and adds this full mode built around using the cards in a minigame of their own. This minigame can be played against an AI opponent, or against another person. Playing against another person requires an additional Neo-Geo Pocket Color, an additional copy of the game, and a link cable‚Äîjust like Battle mode. The object of the minigame is to acquire six points, which are awarded based on a one-on-one competitive card selection game similar in some respects to the card game War. First, the player antes up with one of their own collected cards, and the opposing entity bets a card of their own. Next, the two participants choose a class of cards from which to draw and play a card (10, J, Q, K, or A). Some classes are relatively weak but award high points upon winning a round (10 cards beat only A cards, but award five points upon doing so), whereas others are relatively strong but award low points upon winning a round (A cards beat K, Q, and J cards, but award only two points upon doing so). The choices are revealed and players are awarded points based on whose card won. If both players select the same class, then the card with the higher power statistic wins. Rounds continue until one player wins by being the first to accumulate six points in total. The victor then gets to keep the card bet by their opponent at the outset.  Development  By releasing in November 1999, Puzzle Link 2 released in Japan within the same calendar year as the Neo-Geo Pocket Color version of Puzzle Link. Puzzle Link 2's North American release in April 2000 preceded the North American discontinuation of the Neo- Geo Pocket Color by only two months.  Reception  Puzzle Link 2 received favorable reviews upon release: IGN gave the game a 9.0 out of 10, subtitled 'Amazing.' IGN's Craig Harris wrote the review and‚Äîdespite noting its similarity to the original‚Äîconcludes, \\"It's one of the NeoGeo's best puzzlers, and if you haven't picked up the original I highly recommend Puzzle Link 2.\\" Game Informer Magazine gave the game an 8 out of 10.

However, she believed that schools were interpreting Fr√∂bel incorrectly. While she returned to teaching proper after being relieved of her instructor duties in July 1893, Agnew continued to submit recommendations to improve the quality of infant education in Australia. In 1910, Agnew was appointed as head teacher at Dutton Park Girls' and Infants' School. Her advice began to bear fruit especially after a teaching conference in July 1911.

Sivadasan and produced by Sunil T. Fernando for Sunil T. Films. It stars Kamal Addararachchi and Sangeetha Weeraratne in lead roles along with Sanath Gunathilake and Paboda Sandeepani. Music composed by Somapala Rathnayake. It is the 1199th Sri Lankan film in the Sinhala cinema. This film is a remake of Tamil film Anjali. The muhurath ceremony was celebrated at Rajagiriya Sovereign Hotel. The film introduced many child actors to the film industry. Plot The story begins as Maalathi, a woman who is a mother of a son and a daughter is expecting her third child. However, Malathi is told by her husband Senaka, that her newborn child had died at the moment she was born. The child was a girl and she was to be given the name Nilesha. The film proceeds with the family moving to a new house in an apartment and the two kids do childish things to enjoy themselves with the kids in the apartment. Meanwhile, they get to know there is an ex-convict called Bandu in the apartment. They get curious about this so one day they even sneak into his house. They also make fun of a child with a mental disorder who is living in the apartment. There is a sub- plot where Mr. Abeypala's son has a crush with Mr.Silva's daughter and the kids make fun of the two elders. The two elders seem to be against each other. =5 Years Later= Malathi discovers that her husband spends money for some reason she is not aware of. Senaka reveals that the third child, is still alive. The money was spent to pay the monthly fee to a nurse Laalani, dedicated to take care of her. The doctor of the hospital explains the whole story to Malathi, stating that they still cannot assure that Nilesha will live for a long time. The couple bring their child home. Nilesha's brain has not developed parallel to her age. It is not an easy task for the child to get friendly specially with her sister. However, she starts to get fond of both her brother and sister. Her brother saves her from being insulted by the other kids. It appears that Nilesha finds it hard to interact with Malathi and to accept her as her mother because of her low-intelligence. One day Senaka saw Kalau Ranji a criminal, with two others insulting a man on his way to home. The criminals use a van which looks like an ambulance. He gives a verbal statement to the police officers. Later on, the criminals come to his workplace and threaten him to withdraw his statement or else his two kids will be kidnapped, presumably. Meanwhile, Malathi finds Nilesha playing with Bandu and takes her away from him. The child with a mental disorder is kidnapped by the criminals using the same van which they used earlier. The kids run after them but in vain. In a sub-plot, there is a meeting between the residents in the apartment and the chairperson tells Senaka and Malathi that the other residents are complaining about Nilesha. At this moment, Bandu comes forward and convinces the gathering that everyone in the apartment has faults and it is not sensible to tell the family to leave. Meanwhile, Nilesha is hospitalized again due to sudden unconsciousness. Bandu fights with Kalu Ranji and his associates who try to attack Senaka. At the end of the film Nilesha gets unconscious again but recovers and tells his mother ‚ÄúAmma.‚Äù The lady doctor of Nilesha has a telephone conversation with Senaka and she assures that Nilesha's heart problem can be treated successfully.

She was prominent in organisations promoting Christianity and the interests of women and children.  Early life  Mary Harriett Griffith Mary Harriet Griffith was born 4 November 1849 Portishead, Somerset, England, the daughter of Rev. Edward Griffith and Mary, n√©e Walker. She was only four years old when the family came out to Australia in the small sailing ship Nile. The voyage from Sydney to Brisbane was made on the little coaster steamer, City of Melbourne. Her brother was Samuel Griffith (later Premier of Queensland). Her father Rev. Edward Griffith was one of the pioneers of Congregationalism in Queensland. The family settled in Ipswich, Queensland. After a few years there Mr. Griffith took the oversight of the Congregational church at Maitland, New South Wales. His sons attended the high school there, and Miss Griffith also received portion of her schooling at that town. In 1860, her father relocated to Brisbane where he was the minister at the Wharf Street Congregational Church.  Religious and charitable work  Miss Griffith found a congenial atmosphere in the church work into which she entered with a quiet zeal which characterised all of her life. She never sought pre-eminence, but her work was marked by practicality and an absence of ostentation. The spectacular did not appeal to her. Her judgment was sound, while she was not at all obstinate. Her opinions once formed, took some convincing to remove. Her entire absence of pride appealed to all who came into contact with her. She was essentially Victorian in her outlook on life, and religiously her sympathies extended beyond those of her own denomination, and showed the breadth of her view of life. Many public institutions benefited by her wise counsel and practical help, including the Lady Musgrave Lodge, the Children's Hospital, the Charity Organisation Society, the National Council of Women, the City Mission, the Brisbane Benevolent Society, the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Young Women's Christian Association and the Aged Christian Women's Home. During World War I, Miss Griffith was associated with the Red Cross Society and other, patriotic organisations. In 1911 she was honoured with the distinction of Lady of Grace of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of which she was the only recipient in Queensland. The decoration was conferred upon her at Government House by Sir J William MacGregor, the then Governor of Queensland.  Later life  She died on 27 July 1930 aged 80 at the Aged Christian Women's Home New Farm, Brisbane and buried with Congregational forms in Toowong cemetery. The main entrance doors to the Young Women's Christian Association rooms were officially opened, and dedicated in her memory on 6 May 1931. The doors are of glass, ornamented with the association triangle in royal blue, black, and gold. Lady Goodwin, who officially unlocked the doors, was met on arrival by the president (Mrs. W. H. Birnes) and the general secretary (Miss Rose Winter). She was presented with a sheaf of gladioli. In unveiling the table above the doors Lady Goodwin paid tribute to the long and unselfish life of Miss Griffith. Mrs. Barnes expressed the boards desire to pay tribute to Miss Griffith, who had given a great deal of her life to the Young Women's Christian Association.

Her husband died in late 1893, after which she moved to San Francisco, California, where she exhibited three oil paintings and six watercolors during the spring exhibition of the Hopkins Institute of Art. In March 1894 she exhibited at the California Midwinter International Exposition in the same city. A self-portrait was displayed at the California State Fair in 1895 in Sacramento.\\"In the Pavilion,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, September 3, 1895, page 5, column 2 Murder and childbirth =Crime= Mrs. Hartley then moved to Reno, Nevada in October 1893 and rented a studio on the third floor of the Bank of Reno, where she offered art lessons and painted portraits.

Foley, the bank president, who visited her in her studio and insisted that he drink some liquor with him, drugged brandy and benedictine, she said. She took a sip and he persuaded her to drink it all. She lost consciousness, awoke once passed out again.

The all-male jury found Mrs. Hartley guilty of second-degree murder, with a recommendation of mercy. She was sentenced to eleven years in prison. On November 16, 1894, she gave birth to a boy, whom she named Vernon Harrison Hartley. Petitions both for and against the sentence were presented to the State Board of Pardons. It met on June 3, 1895, and turned down her bid for freedom. On June 18 she and the baby were taken to the state prison in Carson City, where they were assigned to two adjoining rooms and she was given the privileges of a trusty. Freedom and lawsuit In January 1897 the State Board of Pardons granted her a full pardon on the ground that the shooting was justified in that Foley had \\"wronged her,\\" that she had been sufficiently punished and that she had a child to raise. Mrs. Hartley then proceeded to file a suit for one-half of Foley's estate, valued between $2 million and $8 million, on behalf of their son. Testimony began on November 24, 1896, in Carson City. A jury reported it stood 8 to 4 in favor of Mrs. Hartley, but could not reach a valid agreement, and the case was headed for a retrial when news came that the little boy had died of scarlet fever. Mrs. Hartley carried on the case as the heir to her son, but in June 1897, a judge declared that her testimony was not valid and she was declared not of interest to the estate, which at that point was estimated to be only $100,000. Church disturbance Mrs. Hartley was in the news again when she interrupted a service at the Emmanuel Baptist Church in San Francisco to stand and declare that she had a message concerning Theodore Durrant, who at that time was being tried for murdering two women whose bodies were found in the church two years earlier. She said that God had told her that Durrant was innocent and that his life should be spared. Ushers and others escorted her from the church, where she was surrounded by passers-by and a policeman investigated, but Mrs. Hartley hurried away.

After education at the Leathersellers' Company's school in Lewisham, he entered Independent College, Homerton as a scholar in 1798. In 1800 Collyer began his ministry in a small congregation at Peckham, over which he was ordained in December 1801. Under his ministry the congregation increased, and the chapel was several times enlarged. Previous to this, he had in 1813 received an invitation to succeed to the pulpit at Salters' Hall Chapel, which, with the consent of the congregation at Peckham, he accepted, an arrangement being made that he should occupy both pulpits. The Peckham chapel was in 1816 rebuilt and reopened under the name of Hanover Chapel. Satirical print by George Cruikshank on the opening of Hanover Chapel by William Bengo' Collyer, a nonconformist minister, and its support by two Royal Dukes The University of Edinburgh awarded Collyer the degree of D.D. in 1808.

Published by: Cambridge University Press on behalf of the American Society of Church History. Collyer and Fry's translations into Hebrew of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, carried out with the help of Judah D'Allemand, were published in 1813 and 1815 respectively. From 1820 to 1824 Collyer edited, with James Baldwin Brown the elder and Thomas Raffles, The Investigator, a quarterly. It attacked Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley as immoral. The article \\"Licentious Publications in High Life\\" of 1822, after Shelley's death, received a reply \\"Canting Slander: To the Reverend William Bengo Collyer\\" over a number of issues of The Examiner, attributed to William Hazlitt. In 1823 Collyer rode out a scandal around his examination of young men, in the Addington Square baths, that was brought up in The Lancet. Collyer died aged 71 in 1854. A funeral sermon was preached at Hanover Chapel by John Morison, on 16 January. Works William Bengo' Collyer, from the Evangelical Magazine, 1823 Collyer was the author of: * Fugitive Pieces for the use of Schools, 1803 * Hymns designed as a Supplement to Dr. Watts, 1812 * Services suited to the Solemnisation of Matrimony, administration of Baptism, &c.;, with Original Hymns, 1837.

Concepts that are commonly associated with privacy in education include the expectation of privacy, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Fourth Amendment, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The majority of privacy in education concerns are prevalent to the protection of student data, such as educational records and other personal information, both inside and outside the traditional classroom setting as well as the privacy and confidentiality of medical records. Many scholars are engaging in an academic discussion that covers the scope of students‚Äô privacy rights, from student in K-12 and even higher education, and the management of student data in an age of rapid access and dissemination of information.  Expectation of privacy  \\"Expectation of privacy,\\" similar to the \\"right to privacy,\\" is a phrase that describes the natural desire of humans to maintain their sense of privacy. There is currently no legal definition in the American law that explicitly grants humans the right to privacy. Oftentimes, the Fourth Amendment is utilized by people in court cases to defend themselves from actions that involve certain infringements upon their privacy, such as searches that require warrants. However, over the years, the U.S. Supreme Court has found it difficult to determine an impartial non-biased meaning for \\"expectation of privacy\\" because there are too many subjective variables to consider.  Student expectation of privacy  In line with the general meaning of \\"expectation of privacy,\\" student expectation of privacy refers to a student's inherent right to privacy in the school system. Examples of student expectation of privacy, especially in the pre-collegiate levels, include the protection of a student's academic record from being viewed by anyone other than the academic instructor, the student's parents or guardians, and the students themselves. There have been many legal cases regarding the privacy concerns of pupils' academic records, for example the Owasso Independent School District v. Falvo that was handled by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002. This particular case began in October 1998 when Kristja J. Falvo filed a lawsuit against the Owasso Independent School District on the premise that the grading practice employed in her children's classroom, peer grading, was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and of FERPA. Additionally, peer grading embarrassed her children in front of their peers, which could be interpreted as a violation of a student's expectation of privacy in the classroom. When the case reached the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, it was ruled in October 2000 that peer grading was not a violation of the constitutional Fourteenth Amendment but was, in fact, a violation of FERPA. The Tenth Circuit judges reasoned so by closely interpreting the statue in FERPA about privacy protection of \\"educational records.\\" Since it was agreed upon that teacher grade books were considered \\"educational records,\\" the Tenth Circuit decided that anything that went into these grade books, including student grades written on student work, were also considered \\"educational records\\" and thus subject to FERPA's privacy protection policies. After the court decision was released, peer grading practices were banned in school districts within the Tenth Circuit regional borders. The case ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001, and it was soon flipped. In 2002, the Supreme Court Justices officially ruled that peer grading was not a violation of FERPA. They reasoned that student grades on student work were not considered \\"educational records\\" until the teacher had physically recorded the grades into a grade book. Thus, peer grading returned as a common grading practice in classrooms across the United States. Other examples of student expectation of privacy include the right of children to withhold personal information from teachers within in a traditional classroom setting. Such topic remains as a contentious educational privacy concern in the classroom. Some argue that teachers should know more information about students in order to help support them in their academic endeavors. Others argue that teachers should refrain from prying into the personal lives of children because, like adults, children should have the right to privacy and determine the amount of information that they reveal to teachers. Still others make the claim that children are too young to make this decision for themselves and should consult their parents prior to revealing anything personal to their teachers.  Student educational records  Student educational records, according to the FERPA statue, is defined as \\"those records, files, documents, and other materials which--(i) contain information directly related to a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a person acting for such agency or institution.\\" = Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) = The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 was propelled by New York Senator James Buckley who promoted the importance of protection and privacy of educational records of students who attended primary and secondary schooling. As a federal legislation, FERPA grants students under the age of 18 and their parents the right to manage their educational records, which may include data about their academic performance, medical information, behavioral analysis, and more. Thus, when parents or guardians feel that their children's educational records have been exposed to the public in some way, they are able to file claims against the school district as a violation of FERPA. For students over the age of 18, particularly those enrolled in postsecondary education institutions, FERPA can be vague and unclear about the disclosure of educational records to parents. Since individuals aged 18 and over are recognized as adults by the law, FERPA separates students in postsecondary education and their parents in terms of access to educational records such as health and drug records. According to Baker, many controversial issues may arise. For example, Baker writes that \\"FERPA regulation 99.31(a)(8) allows disclosure to parents without the student's prior written authorization if the student is 'dependent' on the parents as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.\\" However, there may be circumstances under which financially dependent students would not want their private records accessed by their parents. Additionally, FERPA authorizes the release to parents or guardians of information about recorded drug or alcohol use by students under the age of 21. If the underage and illegal drug or alcohol use resulted in legitimate concerns and disciplinary action, school administrators can notify and disclose details to parents without the students' permission. = Common Core = As the Common Core State Standards are being developed and implemented in schools across the United States, some academics are bringing awareness to the potential privacy concerns of student data and educational records. According to Stacie Hunt, the Common Core system creates a large student database that keeps track of student performance and information from pre-K to college and even beyond. Federal government and other agencies are able to gain access to this database, analyze student data records, and sell pertinent information to the schools and districts overall. This creates a privacy concern about student data being spread and utilized by third-parties without the students', or their parents', explicit permission. = Educational technology (\\"Edtech\\") = Educational technology (\\"edtech\\") is an emerging field in the area of education. According to Dylan Peterson, \\"edtech represents a broad category of educational products and services used in schools and by private individuals.\\" Privacy concerns surround the fact that large amounts of data of each student using edtech are collected and stored in a wide database that can be accessed by schools. This data may be personal to the students and they may not wish for others to view it. However, edtech companies claim that without storing as much student data as possible, it would be more difficult to create programs that effectively address the students' educational needs. More and more educators are using technology, and it is likely to grow to the point where advanced technologies can be representative of all educational settings. This implies that every educator will eventually need to be aware of the use of technology, and be mindful of what the technology captures and whether it stores learners' personal data. = Students with disabilities = To help improve programs that benefit the educational experience of students with disabilities, some scholars propose a digitalized database of student records that are updated in real time. This is so that educators can keep track of important information about students with various disabilities and monitor their academic performances for educational purposes. While these scholars support the idea of disclosure of data of students with disabilities, they make it very clear that strong legislation and policies must be enforced to protect the privacy of such data. It is currently a debate whether or not digitalized student data that can be accessed by many parties is really beneficial to support individuals with disabilities in school. Some are not comfortable with the idea that the data is updated frequently and disseminated widely, while others believe that the acquisition of such data is necessary to improve programs and enrich educational experiences.  Privacy in higher education  = Historical perspective = Since the 1970s, the commonly held perspective was that the right to privacy was an evaluation of individual worth. Further, technology, even before the World Wide Web, was perceived as having potentially negative effects such as allowing information to be breached. Yet, there were not many violations warranted that would urge legislation to act and shift their attention to protecting privacy in education or primarily individual privacy in general. Technology was also viewed as a source to uncover values, behaviors, motives and thoughts but at the same time, many thought that only qualified professionals had access to personal data. However, specifically in higher education, there was a perspective that individuals were susceptible to having their information breached. Thus, the role of education in the 1970s was viewed as one that safeguarded its students and staff to ensure privacy and prevent data from being breached given the technology that existed. = College dormitory searches = In many public and private colleges and universities across the United States, enrolled students typically live on campus in college-operated dormitories. Since students live in these dormitories for the duration of about one year, many personalize and consider their dormitory rooms as their personal and personalized living space. However, these dormitories are property owned by colleges and often students must waive their right to privacy for college representatives to conduct searches for safety purposes. While some believe that dormitory searches are effective for maintaining a safe community on campus, others believe that these searches are a violation of student privacy. Many cases have been filed by students in which they were caught with illegal substances in their dormitories during searches that these students felt were an invasion of their private living spaces. Additionally, only public or government-related searches with warrants are protected under the Fourth Amendment. Oftentimes college dormitory searches would be regarded as private searches and thus undergo lawsuits that claim a violation of the Fourth Amendment. For example, in the case Morale v. Grigel, a Resident Assistant at the New Hampshire Technical Institute searched a student's room on multiple occasions even though the student was not present in the room at all times. Once the Resident Assistant found marijuana in the room, the student was arrested for possessing illegal substances on college campus property. The student then filed a lawsuit against the Resident Assistant on the grounds that the searches were private and thus violated his Fourth Amendment right to protection from private searches. However, the court concluded that the Resident Assistant's employment status rendered him as a government agent and thus his searches were conducted on behalf of the college, a government-related institution. = Social networks = Within social networks, or particular websites that enable the sharing of information as well as communication among individuals, there exists a level of privacy that students prefer to keep their personal information or social life private from school personnel or faculty in order to avoid context collapse.  Facebook  Technology enables the creation of one's own social presence through informal settings as well as formal settings that allow for the connection of student and instructors for academic purposes. Students in higher education using Facebook typically censor or block their information from instructors. Thus, Facebook is primarily used to interact with friends and family rather than instructors. By students blocking their information, they believe that they avoid context collapse that may cause confusion of who the person really is. Typically, students prefer to be present in the classroom and have their social life private from formal settings. = Learning analytics = With the improvement of technology, more data has become available within higher education. Administrators are then able to learn more about students in order to implement forms of improving student's success. Through learning analytics, which is defined as the focus on \\"students and their learning behaviors, gathering data from course management and student information systems in order to improve student success,\\" administrators are able to obtain real-time empirical data such as insights and responses of student's learning processes. Yet the privacy issues arise in how student data is collected, stored, analyzed and presented to stakeholders. There arises ethical issues of \\"location and interpretation of data; informed consent, privacy, and de-identification of data; and classification and management of data.\\" Students believe that data about them is elaborate and personalized and at the same time hold a conservative view about learning analytics. Learning analytics helps obtain real time data for higher education learning processes but, at the same time may hinder the development of students such as critical thinking and autonomous learning. It is not as simple as saying that learning analytics will benefit students and thus increase their success and retention rates. This is such because procedures to regulate access are put in place while at the same time bias and lack of validity and comprehension affect the ability to obtain data that will then be used for the benefit of students. = Data breaches = As of 2017, there has been over 30 data breaches since 2005. The susceptibility to breaches creates threats to institutional research (IR) professionals who store and manage student data within the regulatory structure that controls data management. Further than this, student information is then brought to light which can threaten them as well. As vast amounts of data continues to be actively collected, potential breaching through hacking, physical theft, and by vendors becomes more probable. Preventative measures Those who study the implications of data breaches emphasize that data should be kept to a minimum and that steps should be taken in order to see who can be trusted to regulate this information in order to keep data private and not accessible to all employees. They also talk about investing in educating employees about what can and cannot be done with data. Further, they state that institutions should use the resources available at their own college/university in order to most effectively implement policies and procedures to keep data private. Exercising caution against third-party vendors that help with data is advised and further that there should be a contract established that 1) defines who exactly who will be working with data, 2) makes clear that data is sensitive and thus should be handled with care, 3) and includes security procedures that describe the exact responsibility of the vendor just in case data is breached. Writers who investigate data breaches in higher education advise that research professionals should understand that data breaches are bound to happen and that it is better to implement policies and take preventative measures in the first place to ensure the security of data. = Educational records in higher education = Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 limits the ‚Äúdisclosure of certain information contained in a student‚Äôs education record to third parties‚Äù, which includes parents if the student has not given consent. Third parties can be parents, family, another institution (mental health providers), or pursuants of a subpoena or court order (law enforcement). It gives colleges and universities the right to \\"inspect and review\\" educational records that can disclosed if 1) consent is given by the student, 2) if the information falls within the definition of \\"directory information\\" (information that is not considered harmful such as name, major and address), 3) if the information is of \\"legitimate educational interest\\" (if an official needs to review the education records in order to fulfill their responsibilities within the University), 4) the student is tax dependent, 5) if it regards drugs or alcohol violations, 6) if it involves serious conduct violations, and 7) when it involves health or safety emergencies Examples of health or safety emergencies are if a student in a residence hall is diagnosed with a contagious disease (measles), has a serious eating disorder, has suicidal ideation, binge drinks heavily, or has erratic and angry behaviors. Furthermore, information can be released if it entails disciplinary information such as a student who is an ‚Äúalleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense.\\" However, there have been cases where troubled students remain in college, without the college or university advising parents about their \\"strange\\" behavior, which resulted in students to take their own lives. The cases of Jain v. Iowa, Shin v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Mahoney v. Allegheny College exemplify this issue. Nonetheless, according to FERPA, disclosures are considered to be made in ‚Äúgood faith based upon the available facts.‚Äù Educational records are covered by FERPA. They are not just academic records, class schedules or transcripts but also financial records, disciplinary records, \\"disability accommodation records, photographs, e-mails, and electronic database records.\\" Official documentation is needed to fall under FERPA even if this entails a personal experience or observation. What is not covered under FERPA are: law enforcement records, treatment records, and sole possession records and instead fall under other laws or considerations. In Loco Parentis Due to the influence of FERPA, there has been a shift from in loco parentis, to in sin parentibus, and back to in loco parentis. In sine parentibus means \\"without parents\\" meanwhile in loco parentis means \\"in place of the parent.\\" Thus, as represented by FERPA, the shift to in loco parentis within higher education is the act of the school taking over the legal responsibility of parents. This means that college authorities stand in place of parents. The role of FERPA is to enhance student achievement through greater parent involvement as well as protecting the private interests of students. Yet, the shift toward in loco parentis also comes with concerns related to educational records. More specifically, there is a concern about the extent to which large and powerful institutions obtain information to their advantage such as data that is gathered by researchers and policymakers. On the other hand there are concerns that relate to the university itself disclosing information. For example, under FERPA, the school can disclose information about students to parents if it includes alcohol and drug related incidents any time if they are under 21. Because of reasons like these, there is a concern that there may be \\"systematic disclosure policies\\" that become out of control and thus harm student rights and privacy. Privacy vs. confidentiality Within student records there is a difference between what is privacy and what is confidentiality. Privacy is more of a legal concept and is defined as the \\"right of a person to withhold himself and his property from public scrutiny if he so chooses.\\" Thus privacy gives the individual the right to be let alone which means that the university itself does not have the right to pry into student's personal affairs or reveal student information unless there are explicit and valid reasons in doing so or permission has been granted by the student. Yet even giving permission does not mean that the student has given permission to have all of their information revealed from then on but rather than permission is granted within the particular circumstance. On the other hand, confidentiality means that files and records of students are not authorized to be disclosed to third parties such as not disclosing information that is received in confidence from a patient and physician. Given this, authors who focus on confidentiality ask questions such as: # Does the communication originate in confidence? # Is the element of confidentiality essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relationship between the parties? # Is the relationship one that must be fostered?? # Will there result an injury that is greater than any benefits which may be gained from that disclosure? If the answers are \\"yes\\" then the university may be legally bound to not disclose information unless it overrides the interest. = Medical records = The terms privacy and confidentiality arise when it comes to medical records. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 provides privacy to data that is related to medical or mental health records that are legally more restrictive than FERPA in regards to confidentiality. HIPAA includes provisions that ‚Äúintend to facilitate the creation of a national system for the electronic transmission and exchange of medical record information‚Äù such as access to information that is individually identifiable like health plans and health care. The act ‚Äúdefined protected health information so as to exclude individually identifiable health information that is included in education records covered by FERPA and that is in treatment records that are exempted from FERPA.‚Äù The difference between educational records and treatment records is that treatment records fall under federal and state law while educational records fall under FERPA. Nevertheless, the documentation of patient and caregiver is confidential meaning that medical records will not be disclosed unless consent is given or there is a belief that disclosing records is crucial. Furthermore, generally, health care providers do not disclose information unless they meet a standard that falls above the required FERPA health or safety exception, or consent is given, and thus is limited in providing information within the constraints of the confidentiality among patient and provider. Integration of mental and physical records In some instances, college campuses have begun to integrate physical and mental health needs of patients. This means that medical records are becoming more shared among physicians as well as counselors or psychologists that work with students. Yet, medical providers, separately, have the obligation to withhold confidential information as an ethical duty and state privacy regulations. For example, health providers such as counselors, also have the obligation to be confidential and not disclose private information. However, as medical providers move towards integrated care, such that mental and physical records are shared amongst themselves, there arises a confidentiality challenge that may lead to college students to fall behind in school. Since confidentiality is compromised as information is disclosed among providers that use this method of continuity care, less students utilize therapy because they refuse to disclose private information that can then be shared with others. This simultaneously fuels the stigma towards college counseling. Thus, as more information becomes disclosed, less college students seek counseling due to lack of confidentiality as medical records of patients are disclosed between medical providers, when legally the obligation of these medical providers is to abide and guarantee privacy and confidentiality by withholding patient's information unless under specific circumstances. Further, outside of sharing information among medical providers, there is also the issue of sharing information with researchers. They claim that medical records are difficult to access but when they are, it opens up the door for research. Yet, at the same time it opens the door to privacy and confidentiality risks. Electronic health records Since technology continues to revolutionize, medical records have become accessible as electronic health records. This allows information to be shared more easily but appears to create a challenge for stigma management and disclosing information during medical appointments. An in-depth interview study called \\"Negotiating stigma in health care: disclosure and the role of electronic health records\\" was made that took into account sexual minority men (gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men) in the U.S. to seek how they viewed electronic health records. What the study found is that there were concerns of privacy in terms of how the electronic aspect creates a barrier to be open and talk about seemingly confidential information as well as how it may challenge the right to confidentiality and privacy. On the other hand, the study also found that electronic health records may benefit by improving communication among providers when sharing information and further, to provide better care especially after the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical and Health Act invested billions in the adoption of electronic health records to improve the quality of care. The study concludes that technology may enhance medical care yet at the same time fuel the stigma that seeking medical help is bad and thus would hinder patients to make appointments, to attend counseling with certain providers, or disclose personal information such as sexual identity and HIV status that they believe will be shared to others without their consent. State laws Federal regulations allow states to place their own regulations, to either increase or decrease the requirements for disclosure, but states who do are few. * Minnesota State Law In 1996 the state of Minnesota placed a law regarding medical records that appeared to be more stringent than HIPAA. Minnesota law attempted to obtain a \\"written general authorization for such release from the patient\\" as a form to impede the activities of researchers or providers to share information without given consent. Hospitals in Minnesota even made brochures that highlight patient's rights to confidentiality and that they can give consent in writing if they allow for their medical records to be released outside of the facility. Thus, the law required health care providers to obtain a written consent and authorization from patients in order for medical records to be released and used for research. However, researchers themselves campaigned against the law and the law was not successful in enforcing the right that patients have to refuse their information to be released. Meanwhile, the patients themselves wanted information as to what information is being used within their medical records. As of 2006, under Minnesota's state rights, individuals have the right to: see and get a copy of their medical records, have information added to their medical records in order to make them accurate, file a complaint, and importantly, sue in state court for violations of their rights under state law. * Massachusetts State Law The Massachusetts state law imposed the requirement that a person has the right against the unreasonable interference of privacy and states that the superior court shall have jurisdiction to enforce a person's right and thus must award damages if need be. According to the law there are strict privacy protections classified as medical. Records are considered educational records unless there exists there need be heightened confidentiality such as child abuse, AIDS, substance abuse, immigration status, pregnancy and abortion. Further, it is considered a medical record if a school-based clinic is under ‚Äúoperation of an outside entity or by a physician under any employment arrangement‚Äù and considered educational records if not considered for heightened confidentiality. If an individual believes that their right to privacy they have the right to file a complaint with the Officer for Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Health and Human services against health care providers, with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine against doctors and with the Department of Public Health against hospitals. * California State Law The Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) is a California state law that includes more information than HIPAA in regards to medical records. The main function is to protect confidentiality of identifiable medical information obtained by an individual's health care provider. It applies to licenses providers such as physicians and nurses. It prohibit medical providers to disclose medical information without obtaining authorization first and that any medical information about an individual is preserved in confidentiality by anyone who comes in contact with it. An individual whose confidentiality is not respected may obtain $1,000 and the amount of actual damages and for the person or entity that discloses confidential information is liable for an administrative fine. = Student and professional archetypes = Students with disabilities Tension on campus arises because as of the event of 9/11 some people on campus are fearful or overreact in demanding to know which students have conduct records or a disability accommodation. There is a tension of whether the information will be used to discriminate or treat students unfairly. Nevertheless, the distribution of this information is not limited by FERPA among school officials as long as the disclosure is done due to \\"legitimate educational interests.\\" Foreign students The event of 9/11 impacted the release of information of students with visas and leads to the questioning of the responsibility and obligation of universities to report foreign student's information. Foreign individuals granted the opportunity to study in the U.S. for a period of time are given one of three visas: F-1 for academic studying, J-1 for exchange visitors, and M-1 for vocational training. However, the government claims that there are no accurate records of the 547,000 individuals holding student status (as of 2003). Meanwhile, universities are supposed to report information the information of F-1 and M-1 students to the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) such as their name, date and place of birth, current address, student status, degree program, field of study, etc. For those with J-1 visas, the sponsoring organization is to report information such as the individuals activities and compliance. Yet, if they do not necessarily report the information they are at least required to keep track of their foreign student's information. Importantly, regulations are not addressed in regards to how FERPA applies. The school may release information if the student is no longer enrolled if it needs to comply with judicial order, if it lawfully issues a subpoena, or if there are \\"specific and articulable facts‚Äù that show that a student‚Äôs education record may contain information relevant to investigation or prosecution. Information can also be disclosed if it includes the protection of health or safety of students, especially if it is to ‚Äúprotect the health and safety of Americans.‚Äù Further, students who were issued I-20A or I-20M forms (F-1 and M-1 students) or DS-2019 forms (J-1 students) automatically grant consent to any information needed to determine immigrant‚Äôs status or release information that's related to the individual‚Äôs compliance with the Exchange Visitor Program. Yet, this information is stated to be only given to certain organizations such as the INS or the Department of State. Librarians Librarians themselves take part in protecting the right of library users privacy. Typically, the library itself aims to protect user's information primarily regarding what they do when they use technology, such as using computers to surf the web. According to Michael Zimmer in 2014, 95 percent of librarians agree or strongly agree individuals should control their personal information and many agree that there are threats to the privacy of their users. A survey conducted by the Office for Intellectual Freedom which obtained over 1,000 responses of librarians and library professionals found is that the Library Bill of Rights is honored which believe that everyone is entitled to \\"freedom of access, freedom to read texts and view images, and freedom of thought and expression\\" The Librarian's Code of Ethics and the adoption of the Privacy Act of 1974 also illuminate not just on a librarian level but also on a federal level that privacy is to be protected. Other non-governmental acts that protect the right to privacy and thus limit the information that can be collected are: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Credit Reporting Act. Further, the Library 2.0 tools and services enhance what the user can do but at the same time track, collect and retain data that then may affect individuals especially since the recent dominance of social media. Yet, because of librarian's belief of protecting the rights of users, they take their own initiative in protecting user's information by destroying access logs daily, posting warning signs, and teaching users about privacy issues. This is especially done in order for information to not be obtained outside of legal restrictions. Specifically, the Livingston Lord Library (LLL) of Minnesota State University's mission is to support both cultural and academic experiences and to encourage lifelong learning. Thus, their particular library provides resources that allows individuals to enhance their knowledge and skills. At the same time, they work to maintain their image of believing in confidentiality such that people can exercise their First Amendment right. Yet, there is not specific documentation as of 2007 that displays what privacy is to them. Nevertheless, there are examples of librarians exerting effort to ensure confidentiality and privacy by protecting their user's information. = Role of Campus Privacy Officers = Campus Privacy Officers (CPO's) are individuals within the institution who have the institutional responsibility for anything that regards privacy, they make sure that privacy is upheld within higher education. Yet they are relatively new in the United States but nevertheless have been growing since 2002. Their role or function in higher education is: ‚Äúsustaining an environment where faculty and student are free to inquire, experiment, discover, speak, and participate in discourse is without intimidation, protecting against and responding to modern-day cybersecurity threats, protecting the interests of individuals and assuring they have appropriate influence over data about themselves, pursuing opportunities for use of data in medical treatment, research, and student success, and enabling shared governance‚Äù Their activities include maintaining: data privacy policies, notices, personal data inventory, governance structure and to respond to both complaints and requests from individuals, among other tasks. A few of the major issues that CPO's focus on are: * Education records and FERPA * HIPAA * \\"Big data, algorithms, analytics, and usage\\" * \\"Contractual agreements\\" * \\"Information security monitoring and the privacy impact of surveillance\\" = Controversies = University of California, Berkeley In 1964 students at UC Berkeley protested against the ban that prevented them from engaging in political activity on campus. FBI Director J.Edgar Hoover got involved because he thought that the Free Speech Movement had to do with Communism that aimed to disrupt Capitalism and thus U.S. government. Particularly, Seth Rosenfield's book \\"Subersives: The FBI's War on Student Radicals, and Reagan's Rise to Power\\" demonstrates how Hoover investigated the movement and specifically student activists such as Mario Savio through \\"'intense surveillance and harassment.'\\" Further, when Clark Kerr, former president of Berkeley and then vice chancellor of the University of California system, lifted the ban on political engagement and further against \\"Communist speakers,\\" the FBI targeted him and tried to get him fired. Hoover had ordered agents to find information about Kerr and leak it to the Board of Regents in order to show that Kerr was not fulfilling his role as president and thus had to be fired. Essentially, what it points to is that in the 1960s, the FBI took on the role of trying to eliminate Communism within the UC Berkeley campus by investigating particular individuals in order to see if they were really Communist or in the case of Kerr to fire them for lifting the ban on political engagement. Some say that this is a breach in privacy because the FBI surveilled and investigated individuals without their consent. Others say that it was needed in order to make sure that no Communist activity was taking place particularly on the Berkeley campus due to the Free Speech Movement. Princeton University In 2002 Princeton University‚Äôs admission staff accessed a Yale University website used to inform applicants that they have been admitted. The act of Yale University accessing private information was brought to light. As a result, Yale University responded that it would improve their website with additional security to prevent another breach. Meanwhile, Princeton University responded by announcing the resignation of the top Princeton admissions official. Some say that acts like these raise the issues of student record privacy in the digital world. University of Oregon In 2015 a woman who said she was raped by three basketball players sued the University of Oregon for disclosing her mental health records to an attorney. This case gave rise to employees from the counseling center to write an open letter that disproved the university's actions. Yet, officials argue that because the women claimed to have emotional distress, the university had the right to her medical records under FERPA. An attorney named Steve McDonald argued that HIPAA did not apply in this case. Meanwhile, Lynn Daggett, a FERPA specialist, stated that the university has the right to get access to student medical records, especially if entails the need for legal defense. This led to Denise Horn, a U.S. Department of Education representative of the time, to write a statement addressing that higher education institutions should comply with FERPA but also respect the expectation of confidentiality between patient and counselor/therapist.

The five main types of gynecologic cancer include cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, vaginal cancer, and vulvar cancer. For patients with these and other gynecologic malignancies within the United States, disparities across the care continuum by socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic background have been previously identified and studied. The causes behind these disparities are multifaceted and a complex interplay of systemic differences in health as well as individual patient factors such as cultural, educational, and economic barriers. Cervix adenocarcinoma  Cervical cancer disparities  Since the development of the Papanicolou smear or Pap smear in 1941, cervical cancer has been highly preventable. The implementation of Pap smear screening programs has resulted in a steady decline in incidence and mortality rates from cervical cancer since the mid-1970s.Ries, L. et al. \\"SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2004.\\" National Cancer Institute (2007). Even with this technology, the American Cancer Society still estimates that within the U.S., about 12,820 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed and 4,210 women will die of cervical cancer by the end of 2017. Despite an overall decline in incidence and mortality rates from cervical cancer for women across the United States, significant disparities have been documented amongst racial and ethnic minorities and socioeconomically marginalized populations. Within the United States, Hispanic women have the highest incidence of cervical cancer, and African Americans have the highest mortality.US Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Cancer Institute; US Cancer Statistics Working Group.United States Cancer Statistics: 1999‚Äì2009 Incidence and Mortality Web-Based Report. = Differences in screening practices = Disparities amongst different minority groups have been attributed to different Pap smear screening practices. African Americans, American Indians, and non-white Hispanics have been found to be diagnosed at later stages than white women, which has been suggested as a potential contributing reason for their worse survival outcomes. One 2001 study in California found that Asian women were the least likely ethnic/racial group to have ever had a Pap test. This study also described varied trends existing within different Asian American subpopulations, identifying how Vietnamese women had the lowest screening rates (62.3%) and Filipino women had the highest screening rates (81.1%). It has also been discovered that foreign-born women in the U.S. have lower screening rates than those born in the U.S. Not only does there exist disparity in screening, but there also exists post- screening disparities in follow-up practices. Adherence to follow-up after abnormal Pap tests varies across minority groups. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, a national initiative focused on increasing access to cervical and breast cancer screening for underserved women followed more than 10,000 participants who had two or more abnormal Pap test results. They found 56% of these patients did not follow-up with a recommended cervical examination, and 27.7% of this group received no follow- up examination whatsoever. Within this study, African Americans had the highest rate of no follow-up. Across all racial/ethnic groups in the U.S., increased poverty and decreased education levels have been associated with higher mortality. = Differences in vaccination = Human papilloma virus (HPV) is consistently present in almost all cervical cancer cases across the world and is the main etiologic factor in cervical cancer. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice advises that females receive the full series of three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at 11‚Äì12 years of age. For females aged 13‚Äì26 years who have not been previously vaccinated, catch-up vaccination is recommended. Despite these national recommendations, the rate of HPV vaccination in the U.S. remains low. One study of 409 females aged 13‚Äì26 found that only 5% of participants had received one or more HPV vaccine dosages. Since parents have an critical role in deciding the vaccination of their young daughters, studies have found that parenting beliefs and attitudes are important to HPV vaccine practices of girls throughout the U.S. = Barriers to prevention =  Cultural/personal barriers  Non-adherence to screening and vaccination have been found to be influenced by cultural and personal beliefs and conditions. Interviews with females of ethnic minorities, specifically Chinese and Hispanics, have revealed that the implications of sexual activity that come with Pap smears impact females decisions to get screened. Some women revealed that they avoid screening to prevent others from thinking that they are sexually active or promiscuous due to embarrassment or concern about being discovered.  Socioeconomic and institutional barriers  Receiving a recommendation by one's physician is strongly correlated with patients seeking out to be screened by a Pap smear. Across different racial and ethnic groups, having a regular doctor increases the likelihood of a patient undergoing regular Pap smearing. Additional barriers such as long wait times, lack of transportation, inability to take off work, lack of family support or available child care options can often impact patients' abilities to seek out and receive appropriate preventative measures and treatment.  Lack of knowledge and awareness  Understanding cervical cancer and its link to human papillomavirus (HPV) is closely related to agreeing to undergo Pap smear screening or get vaccinated against HPV across population types. Cervical cancer patients who have never had a Pap test were more likely to have previously not been aware that they were capable of developing cervical cancer. = Differences in treatment = There have been documented racial and ethnic disparities in clinical treatment for cervical cancer. Research has shown that African Americans are more likely than whites to go untreated. They are also less likely to receive clinical staging or be treated with surgery or combined therapy.  Ovarian cancer disparities  While ovarian cancer accounts for only 3% of cancers for women in the U.S., it is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths for this population.J. Ahmedin, R. Siegel, J. Xu, E. Ward. Cancer statistics, CA Cancer J Clin, 60 (2010), pp. 277‚Äì300 L.A.G. Ries, J.L. Young, G.E. Keel, M.P. Eisner, Y.D. Lin (Eds.), et al., SEER survival monograph: cancer survival among adults: US SEER program, 1988‚Äì2001, patient and tumor characteristics, National Cancer Institute, SEER Program, Bethesda (Maryland) (2007) This cancer is known as the \\"silent killer\\" and is disproportionately lethal because of lack of effective screening and early detection strategies resulting from the absence of disease-specific symptoms. If diagnosed in an early stage (stage I) while the tumor is confined to the ovaries, ovarian cancer is highly treatable with a five-year survival rate over 90%.R.J. Kurman, K. Visvanathan, R. Roden, l.-M. Shih. Early detection and treatment of ovarian cancer: shifting from early stage to minimal volume of disease based on a new model of carcinogenesis, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 198 (4) (2008), pp. 351‚Äì356 However the majority of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed with stage III and stage IV cancer, which are associated with poor prognosis, even with aggressive therapy. = Differences in screening =  Barriers to early detection  Even with poor existing screening methods, around 20% of women with ovarian cancer are still effectively caught and diagnosed at early stages in the U.S. Research has revealed that not having private health insurance coverage decreases a woman's chance of being diagnosed with early stage ovarian cancer.C.R. Morris, M.T. Sands, L.H. Smith. Ovarian cancer: predictors of early-stage diagnosis, Cancer Causes Control, 21 (2010), pp. 1203‚Äì1211. African American women are less likely to be diagnosed at an early stage of ovarian cancer as compared to white women due to lower rates of private health insurance coverage. As a result, African American women have been found to be at higher risk of presenting with advanced, late- stage aggressive ovarian cancer for which current treatment standards can only palliate symptoms.  Genetic screening  Certain genetic components have been found to increase the susceptibility of carriers to develop ovarian cancer.C.N. Landen, M.J. Birrer, A.K. Sood. \\"Early events in the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer, J Clin Oncol, 26 (6) (2008), pp. 995‚Äì1005. Possession of specific mutations of the BRACA1 and BRACA2 genes impose a lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer as high as 20-65%, compared to the 1.4-2.5% risk for a woman from the general population with no affected relatives.M.C. King, J.H. Marks, J.B. Mandell. \\"Breast and ovarian cancer risks due to inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, Science, 302 (5645) (2003), pp. 643‚Äì646. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, also known as Lynch syndrome, is also associated with elevated lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer, at about 10-12%. Genetic screenings are strongly advised for high-risk women who possess a family history of ovarian cancer or any of the aforementioned genetic alterations or who have been diagnosed with early onset colorectal, breast, uterine, or endometrial cancer.H.D. Nelson, L.H. Huffman, R. Fu, E.L. Harris. \\"Genetic risk assessment and BRCA mutation testing for breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility: systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, Ann Intern Med, 143 (5) (2005), pp. 362‚Äì379. Within the U.S., African American women are less likely to undergo genetic counseling or testing as compared to Caucasian women. A national study of 25,364 people revealed that more Caucasian women report having heard about genetic testing for cancer risk as compared to African American, Asian, or Hispanic women, indicating the need for more culturally competent approaches to improve awareness of these screening methods.J.A. Pag√°n, D. Su, L. Li, K. Armstrong, D.A. Asch. \\"Racial and ethnic disparities in awareness of genetic testing for cancer risk, Am J Prev Med, 37 (6) (2009), pp. 524‚Äì530. = Differences in treatment = In the U.S. and the rest of the developed world, surgery is the treatment standard for all stages of ovarian cancer. For later stages, adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve patient survival. Lymphadenectomy and lymph node chemotherapy have also been demonstrated to improve survival for ovarian cancer patients of all stages.R. Angioli, F. Plotti, I. Palaia, M. Calcagno, R. Montera, E.V. Caf√†, et al. Update on lymphadenectomy in early and advanced ovarian cancer, Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol, 20 (1) (2008), pp. 34‚Äì39. The U.S. is the only country that has reported significant ovarian cancer treatment disparities. Within the U.S., African American patients have the highest risk of receiving delayed treatment, non-standard treatment, or no treatment at all.V.L. Williams, H.G. Stockwell, M.S. Hoffman, J.S. Barnholtz-Sloan. \\"Racial differences in treatment modalities among female residents of Florida diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, J Gynecol Surg, 26 (1) (2010), pp. 15‚Äì22.L.C. Harlan, L.X.

Obstet Gynecol, 119 (1) (2012), pp. 68‚Äì77. Patients at community cancer hospitals compared to teaching hospitals were also at higher likelihood for receiving non-standard care. Overall, even with treatment guidelines made by many different organizations, several ovarian cancer patients are not receiving appropriate treatment, especially older and minority women without private insurance.  Endometrial cancer disparities  Endometrial cancer incidence is rising in the U.S across all racial/ethnic groups. The highest increases in incidence rates for endometrial cancer have been observed in African American and Asian women, who tend to present with more aggressive subtypes of endometrial cancer. The overall racial disparity in survival from endometrial cancer between African Americans and whites is greater than in any other type of cancer.Kosary, C.L. \\"Figo Stage, Histology, Histologic Grade, Age and Race as Prognostic Factors in Determining Survival for Cancers of the Female Gynecologic System: An Analysis of 1973-87 SEER Cases of Cancers of the Endometrium, Cervix, Ovary, Vulva, and Vagina Semin Surg Oncol 10 (1) (1994), 31-46. = Differences in treatment = African American women are less likely than white women to receive primary surgery for endometrial cancer. Their associated mortality rate from endometrial cancer has been found to be 84% higher than white women.Ries, L.G., Eisner, M.P., Kosary, C.L, et al. SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1973-1998, National Cancer Institute (2001). = Differences in biological factors = It has been suggested that variance at the molecular level might underlie racial disparities in survival outcome. High expression of the mutant p53 tumor suppressor protein has been found to be associated with poor survival rates for endometrial cancer, and this malignant over-expression has been discovered to occur twice as frequently in blacks than in whites.  Vulvar cancer disparities  Vulvar cancer is the fourth most common gynecologic cancer with approximately 940 deaths from this disease in the United States each year. If caught early without associated nodal involvement, vulvar cancer patients can be treated with a survival rate of 90%. African American women have been shown to have better survival outcomes compared to whites for vulvar cancerDunne, E.F., Unger, E.R., Sternberg, M., et al. Prevalence of HPV infection among females in the United States, JAMA, 297 (2007); 813-819. even though they present with cancer at a significantly younger age. This has been explained by African American's higher rate of human papilloma virus HPV infection. Research reveals that African American women have a higher frequency of HPV-associated vulvar cancers than white women. HPV-positive vulvar cancer is associated with early age onset, less overall aggressive behavior, and better patient prognosis.  Vaginal cancer disparities  Vaginal cancer is a rare cancer type that accounts for less than 1-2% of all gynecologic malignancies. = Differences in screening = Patients who are uninsured or with Medicaid are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage vaginal cancer than those with private insurance. Patients diagnosed at more advanced stages of vaginal cancer tend to have poorer survival outcomes. Studies have revealed that African Americans have a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with advanced stage vaginal cancer and are less likely to survive than their white counterparts. = Differences in treatment = For early stage vaginal cancer patients, surgery helps reduce mortality risk. One study revealed how a significantly lower proportion of African Americans with early stage vaginal cancer underwent surgery as compared to whites, which could partially explain differences in survival rates between these groups.

Arcuatula senhousia, commonly known as the Asian date mussel, Asian mussel or bag mussel, is a small saltwater mussel, a marine bivalve mollusk species in the family Mytilidae, the mussels. Other common names for this species include: the Japanese mussel, Senhouse's mussel, the green mussel (a name also applied to Perna viridis), and the green bagmussel. It is harvested for human consumption in China. This mussel is native to the Pacific Ocean from Siberia to Singapore, but it has also been accidentally introduced and become an invasive species in numerous other areas worldwide. It can live in the intertidal or shallow subtidal zones. In California the species has been recorded in densities of up to 150,000 individuals per square meter. It grows quickly and lives only about 2 years. It prefers soft substrates and surrounds its shell in a dense mass of byssus. One of several negative impacts of this invasive species is that it has a detrimental effect on eelgrass. Description This species is differentiated from other mussels by its relatively small size and inflated shape, as well as by the greenish colour of its outer periostracal layer. The shell has radiating reddish lines on its posterior surfaces, small internal teeth on the dorsal edge posterior to the ligament, and small ribs anterior to the umbones. It can grow up to in length.Edgar, Graham J. Australian Marine Life: The Plants and Animals of Temperate Waters. Victoria: Reed, 1997.Slack- Smith, S.M., A. Brearley. \\"Musculista senhousia (Benson, 1842); a mussel recently introduced into the Swan River estuary, Western Australia.\\" Records of the Western Australian Museum. 13.2 (1987): 225-230. It is also known for its relatively fast growth and has a maximum lifetime of about two years.Crooks, Jeffrey A. \\"Predators of the invasive mussel Musculista senhousia (Mollusca: Mytilidae).\\" Pacific Science. 56.1 (2002): 49-57. Distribution Interior of left valve of Asian date mussel Arcuatula senhousia is native to the Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal areas from Siberia and the Kuril Islands south to Singapore. The mussel has become an invasive species in California, the Mediterranean, Australia, and New Zealand. It was introduced to the Western coast of the United States sometime in the early 20th century with shipments of Japanese oysters. In 1983, large specimens of the species were collected in the Swan River estuary in Western Australia. The mussel has been present in Auckland harbour since 1980, and specimens have also been reported at Tamar estuary in Tasmania. Invasion of the aforementioned locales is thought to have been achieved in a variety of manners: the mussels were transported on the hulls of ships, in water-intake chambers and the ducts of ships, as planktonic larvae carried in the ballast water of bulk-cargo vessels, in association with intentionally introduced oysters, and by Lessepsian migration through the Suez Canal. Ecology =Habitat= The Asian date mussel is generally found in sheltered mud or other soft substrates up to twenty metres below the surface of the water. In China and Japan, where it is native, the mussels are found in intertidal zones with densities up to 2500 individuals per square metre. In Australia, as an invasive species, they are found from below the surface of the water in slightly higher densities. Along the Western coast of North America, however, the species generally reaches densities of 5000 to 10,000 individuals per square metre and has been recorded at densities of up to 150,000 individuals per square metre in Mission Bay in San Diego, California, USA. The mussel is most abundant in the summer and early autumn. In the Swan River estuary in Western Australia, the mussel population has a high mortality rate in the late autumn and early winter. This may be the result of a decrease in water salinity from increased rainfall. =Behavior= Arcuatula senhousia uses byssal threads to form a sort of cocoon around itself. The cocoon may be necessary for protection due to the relatively thin shells of the species, as well as to assist in the stabilization of the individuals within the sediment. The cocoons of the individuals can intertwine to form a mat that tends to trap other shells, sediment, algae, and detritus on its surface. =Predators= Predators of the Asian date mussel vary depending on the native fauna of the area. In the Swan River estuary of Western Australia, for example, predation occurs mainly by boring carnivorous gastropods such as Nassarius burchardi or Bedeva paivae, which drill through the mussel's thin shell. In Mission Bay in San Diego, however, the mussel's main predators include the yellowfin croaker, spotfin croaker, sargo, willet, and the marbled godwit (three fish and two bird species respectively). Other less significant predators include carnivorous gastropods (especially Pteropurpura festiva), crustaceans, echinoderms, fish, and diving ducks. Recent research has emphasized the importance of the predation of Arcuatula senhousia by native fauna as a means of reducing the negative effects of the invasive species on ecosystems. Asian date mussels also face predation by humans. The mussel is gathered as food in China, as food for domestic organisms in Japan, Thailand, and India, as well as bait for fishing throughout Asia. There are currently no commercial or recreational uses for the mussel in the invaded areas. It has been suggested that harvesting the species might help reduce the effects of their invasion; however, there are a number of detrimental effects associated with benthic harvesting. Impact on invaded ecosystems Research has shown that the Asian date mussel can have a variety of effects on various ecosystems. In the Swan River estuary in Western Australia, for example, the presence of mats of Arcuatula senhousia has caused an increase in the biomass of benthic macro- organisms in general. In Mission Bay in San Diego, California, USA, the increasing abundance of Asian date mussels has caused a decrease in species richness and abundance of the native Solen rostriformis as well as the complete disappearance of the native Chione fluctifraga. The Asian date mussel has also become one hundred times more abundant than any native bivalves. Two other native species have appeared in the bay, however: Macoma nasuta and Chione undatella. Laboratory experiments using these species show that the growth and survival of the surface-dwelling and suspension-feeding species of the Chione genus decrease dramatically in areas where the Asian date mussel is abundant. Populations of the deeper-dwelling and deposit-feeding Macoma nasuta are not significantly affected, however, by the invasion of the mussel.Crooks, Jeffrey A. \\"Assessing invader roles within changing ecosystems: Historical and experimental perspectives on an exotic mussel in an urbanized lagoon.\\" Biological Invasions. 3.1 (2001): 23-36. Similar occurrences have been observed at Sacca di Goro, a brackish lagoon in the Po River Delta of the Northern Adriatic Sea in Italy, which the Asian date mussel invaded in the early 1990s. Researchers there have found that growth and survival of suspension feeders has significantly decreased following the arrival of the Asian date mussel. There has also been a concomitant increase in the abundance of detritivores and herbivores.Mistri, M., R. Rossi, and E.A. Fano. \\"The spread of an alien bivalve (Musculista senhousia) in the Sacca di Goro Lagoon (Adriatic Sea, Italy).\\" Journal of Molluscan Studies. 70.3 (2004): 257-261. Laboratory research has also shown that deeper-dwelling species are less affected by the invasion of the Asian date mussel. Mussel mats have no significant effect on the mortality of deeper-dwelling clam species such as Tapes decussatus and Ruditapes philippinarum.Mistri, Michele. \\"Effect of Musculista senhousia mats on clam mortality and growth: much ado about nothing?\\" Aquaculture. 241.1-4 (2004): 207-218. Competition with native species is the primary cause of concern in areas of New Zealand where the Asian date mussel has invaded. There are significantly fewer macrofaunal invertebrates and there has been an eightfold decrease in the abundance of infaunal bivalves. Scientists suggest, however, that the adverse environmental effects of the mussel in New Zealand will be localized and short-lived.Creese, Robert, Simon Hooker, Sharon De Luca, and Yvette Wharton. \\"Ecology and environmental impact of Musculista senhousia (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Mytilidae) in Tamaki Estuary, Auckland, New Zealand.\\" New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research. 31.2 (1997): 225-236. Arcuatula senhousia shares its habitat with eelgrass (Zostera marina) in many of the areas in which it has invaded. The presence of the mussel has been shown to affect rhizome growth in the eelgrass. This decreases the ability of established patches to spread. The Asian date mussel had the most detrimental effect on rhizome growth in areas where the eelgrass was sparse and patchy. This is a cause of concern for conservationists because beds of eelgrass are already degraded and sparse as a result of anthropogenic forces. The presence of Arcuatula senhousia can only worsen the situation.Reusch, Thorsten B.H. and Susan L. Williams. \\"Variable responses of native eelgrass Zostera marina to a non-indigenous bivalve Musculista senhousia.\\" Oecologia. 113.3 (1998): 428-441.

Frederick Mason Perkins and Irene Perkins by Nicholas D'Asnasch, 1955  Biography  Frederick Mason Perkins was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts and grew up in China, where his parents, Americans of English origin, were missionaries. Although they were Protestant, Perkins was educated by Jesuits. When he was young, Perkins studied piano with Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna, then later at Leipzig University of Dresden University. In 1898 he met art historian Bernard Berenson and became his student. From the time Perkins was young he had an interest in Italian art history and in particular for works produced in Tuscany and Umbria in the 14th and 15th centuries. Throughout his life he not only studied these works but also produced catalogs and research about them. He collaborated with specialist art magazines, for example Rassegna d'Arte (founded in 1901) and La Diana, where he published some of his research. He became an art dealer and well known expert, maintaining in his houses in Florence (Lastra a Signa near Sassoforte) and Assisi (in the Piazza del Vescovado) one of the most important private collections of Italian art, which included works by Duccio di Boninsegna, Pietro Lorenzetti, Lorenzo Monaco, Jacopo della Quercia, Gentile da Fabriano, il Sassetta, Sano di Pietro, and Filippo Lippi among others. Perkins's expertise helped both Dan Fellows Platt and George Blumenthal develop their own personal art collections. Perkins married Lucy Olcott in 1900 but the union did not last long. In 1913 he married again, to Irene Vavasour Elder, and this marriage lasted until his death. During World War II, Perkins and his wife were interned in Perugia. Perkins's works of art in Assisi were sequestered and only returned to him after the end of the German occupation of Assisi in October 1944. After the war, Perkins moved to Assisi (before 1947) taking his collection with him. Later, he decided to donate fifty-seven of the works in his collection to the Conventual Franciscasn Friars at the Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi, and today these works can be seen in the Basilica's Treasure Museum. Other works from his collection became part of the collections of the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria and the Diocese of Assisi. In 2004, Sergio Goretti, bishop of Assisi, assigned the 33 works donated to the Diocese, including numerous paintings, a wooden statue, and some drawings (the latter not presently on exhibition) to the Diocesan Museum and Crypt of St. Rufino. Perkins died in Assisi on October 12, 1955 and is buried in the Assisi cemetery. His photo archive, counting 8,000 objects, is housed at I Tatti's Berenson Library.

He fought in the Imperial Russian Army in World War I and in the Soviet Red Army in the Russian Civil War. He was a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner (1922). During the Great Purge, he was arrested on 14 May 1937 and later executed. After the death of Joseph Stalin, he was rehabilitated in 1955.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  Smol was born in 1891 in the village of Khodynino, Ryazan Governorate, the son of an army officer. He graduated from a realschule and in 1914 was conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. After graduating from an accelerated course at the Vladimir Military School later that year, Smolin became a praporshchik in the infantry, serving with the 204th Infantry Regiment. After the February Revolution in 1917 he was elected to the regimental committee. Smolin left the Imperial Army with the rank of podporuchik. He joined the Red Army in 1918, fighting in the Russian Civil War on the Southern and Western Fronts. That year, he served successively as instructor for the formation of Red Guard detachments, as military commander of Ostrogozhsky Uyezd, as a company commander, and as chief of staff and commander of the Consolidated Group of Forces of the 8th Army. From April 1919, Smolin, who joined the Communist Party in 1919, commanded the 2nd Brigade of the 42nd Rifle Division. During the offensive of the Armed Forces of South Russia on the Volchansk- Valuyki between August and September 1919, Smolin and brigade chief of staff Nikolay Yefimov were reported to have \\"personally inspired the brigade's troops\\" and fought against superior White forces in battles near Novy Oskol and southeast of Belgorod, extricating the brigade from the situation and joining the rest of the division. Both received the Order of the Red Banner for their actions on 26 November 1922. Smolin commanded the 47th Rifle Division between November 1919 and March 1920, and then the 21st Rifle Division between July and October of the latter year.  Interwar period  After the end of the war, Smolin became commander of the 2nd Verkhneudinsk Rifle Division and the 11th Rifle Division and served as chief of the directorate of military educational institutions of the Moscow Military District between 1921 and 1923. After graduated from Higher Academic Courses at the Red Army Military Academy in 1923, he became commander of the 6th Rifle Division in July 1923. Going on to command the 3rd Rifle Corps between June and October 1924, Smolin became chief and military commissar of the organization department of the Main Directorate of the Red Army in November of that year. This assignment proved brief as a month later he became commander and military commissar of the 5th Rifle Corps. After serving as chief of the Vystrel course from May 1927, Smolin became assistant commander of the forces of the Red Banner Caucasus Army in December 1929. Succeeding to the command of the army in March 1932, Smolin served as chief and military commissar of the Military Engineering Academy from July 1934, receiving the rank of komkor when the Red Army introduced personal military tanks in 1935. Smolin was arrested on 14 May 1937, and 20 September of that year sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on false charges of participating in a military conspiracy. He was shot on the same day, and was posthumously rehabilitated on 22 October 1955.

Later he returned there but soon realized that painting is not going to be enough for his artistic and personal aspirations. 1965 - 1967 He turned to post graduate studies at Hornsey College of Art, London. The years in London influenced deeply his art. His confrontation with monumental ancient civilization's art in the British Museum was highly influential and left a significant imprint on his art.

A recurring theme of his work is victimhood, reflecting his own youthful experiences during the incineration of Dresden in February 1945 and of the Soviet justice system between 1946 and 1950. His life has been documented in unusual detail, not least by himself. By 2015 it was reported that the daily diary which he has kept since 1953 had reached its 150th unpublished \\"volume\\".  Life  = Childhood and youth = Wieland F√∂rster was born, the youngest of his parents' four children, in Laubegast, a suburb of Dresden. His father was employed in the transport and commercial sectors. In 1935 his father died as a result of wounds sustained during the First World War, leaving his mother to raise the children under conditions of financial hardship. She succeeded in distancing them from Nazi indoctrination. As a school boy, between 1936 and 1944, Wieland rejected the Nazi system and pressures to take part in government sponsored uniformed organisations. In 1944 he took an apprenticeship as a trainee technical draftsman at the Dresden municipal waterworks. Towards the end of 1944, still aged only 14, he was sent for four weeks to a Hitler Youth detention camp. On his release he volunteered for fire-watch duties in order to avoid further unwelcome interruptions to his training and education. It is reported that he was such a quick learner as an apprentice technical draftsmen that after a year he was \\"promoted\\" to a preparatory year for a degree course at the Engineering Academy. He was also conscripted into the local branch of the newly launched German Home Guard (\\"Volksturm\\"), and it was as a member of the Home Guard that he experienced the English and American air attacks that destroyed the central districts of city one day after his fifteenth birthday, on the night of 13 February 1945. In the chaos following the attacks he was able to escape from the Home Guard, remaining in his home district till war ended, formally on 8 May 1945, after which Dresden and the surrounding region of central Germany were administered as the Soviet occupation. Technical draftsmanship was officially designated as women's work, and Wieland was required to undertake hands-on work (\\"als Rohrleger\\") in industrial engineering. On 17 September 1946 he found himself taken in by the police and handed over to the NKVD after a neighbour denounced him on grounds of suspected possession of weapons. The background to the affair was an attempt to make the F√∂rster family exchange their home for rented accommodation, after the German police had blocked an attempt by the Communist authorities to make them pay rent for living in their own home. Wieland was initially sentenced to ten years of forced labour in Siberia, but after three months of nightly interrogation, a Soviet military tribunal reduced the term to 7¬Ω years. On 28 December 1946 he was interned at NKVD \\"Special Camp\\" IV, a concentration camp which the authorities had constructed next to the jail at Bautzen. As the camp commanders set about sorting out the prisoners fit for work to be transported to Siberia, a Soviet military doctor determined that Wieland F√∂rster was unfit for work. He was therefore left behind in NKVD \\"Special Camp\\" IV. In the aftermath of war the authorities refused to discuss or even to acknowledge the continuing existence of concentration camps in the Soviet part of occupied Germany, but their all too physical presence never became increasingly hard to dispute. By 1950 F√∂rster was in poor general health dangerously ill with Tuberculosis and on 21 January 1950, following a threatened investigation by the International Red Cross, he was the beneficiary of a \\"backdoor\\" release, emerging from the camp without identity papers and without any formal pardon or other explanation. Official acknowledgment that he had been a victim of Stalinist persecution followed in 1991. = Further study and training= Despite having emerged from after nearly four years interned in NKVD \\"Special Camp\\" IV, in 1950 F√∂rster was still aged only 20. The previous year, in October 1949, the Soviet occupation zone had been relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). It was in this new kind of one-party dictatorship, with its principal political and economic structures modelled on those of the Soviet Union itself, that F√∂rster built his life and career over the next four decades. He abandoned his ambition to become a technical draftsman, but nevertheless returned to work with the Dresden municipal waterworks, employed in the planning department till 1953. During these years he was using his spare time to try out various artistic forms of expression, such as writing, music, theatre and advertising, along with the more visual arts. In the Autumn/Fall of 1952 he took part in a public \\"drawing event\\" at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where the teachers encouraged him to enroll as a student. He applied to his employers to back his application to sponsor his application to study at the academy, but was turned down for reasons that involved the risk of \\"Verb√ºrgerlichung\\" (loosely: \\"bourgeoisization\\"). He therefore made the application anyway, on his own responsibility, and was accepted. He was a student at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts between 1953 and 1958. He began his study of sculpting in 1953, taught by Walter Arnold and Arnold's assistant Gerd Jaeger . Another of his teachers was Hans Steger. The focus of the training at Dresden was on neoclassical form, backed up by compulsory courses in drawing, on use of plaster casts and on nature. The study of anatomy and history of art were also included and required. By his second year F√∂rster was already establishing contacts with representatives of the officially forbidden \\"classical modern\\" art movement. By this time the division of Germany agreed between the Americans and the Soviets at Yalta at the beginning of 1945 had crystallised into a permanent frontier, but the border between the two Germanies was still relatively porous, especially between West Berlin and the surrounding territories governed as East Germany, and F√∂rster took the opportunity to visit Bernhard Heiliger in the west. Walter Arnold, himself a consummate hands-on craftsman, helped a few of his students, whom he regarded as politically reliable, to deepen their understanding on the essential elements in figurative sculpture, by gaining experience with the works of the westerners Hermann Haller and Charles Despiau. In his third year, required to produce a \\"portrait from a 'photo\\", F√∂rster chose as his subject Bertolt Brecht, a long-standing icon of the German intellectual left but nevertheless at this stage ostracised by the authorities. In order to accomplish his course objective he was permitted, a few weeks before Brecht's death in 1956, to attend a rehearsal of Life of Galileo, being staged by the Berliner Ensemble (theatre company). He received his degree in 1958 he applied for a three-year Master Course at the Arts Academy in East Berlin, hoping to study with Gustav Seitz. However, it was becoming progressively more impractical for Seitz to sustain a life-style that involved pursuing a career simultaneously in West and East Germany, and 1958 was the year in which he opted to base himself in Hamburg (in the west). In order to be able to remain in Berlin, and following the recommendation of Seitz, F√∂rster now hesitantly but successfully applied to become a Master Student (\\"Meistersch√ºler\\") with Fritz Cremer. After just eighteen months his time as a Master Student of Cremer was prematurely terminated in connection with the increasingly heated debate then emerging on the subject of Formalism. He was permitted to use a workshop at the academy to complete his Life-sized plus group of figures \\"V√∂lkerfreundschaft unter Studenten\\" (literally \\"People's friendship between students\\") which won the TU Dresden prize in 1961/62. = Retreat and recovery = In 1961 Wieland F√∂rster set himself up in a Berlin shop building which became his studio. For some years he lived and worked here as a virtual hermit, visited by his family and a couple of close friends, notably and Franz F√ºhmann. The authorities did not endorse his self-imposed exile but nor, at least initially, do they appear to have interfered. His only child, Eva F√∂rster, was born in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg quarter in 1968. From the time she was six years old her father insisted that she should keep a daily diary, a habit through which she developed a succinct writing style: she grew up to become a theatre critic, writer and lyricist-poet. Between 1968 and 1972, the authorities became disruptive. F√∂rster was banned from exhibiting his works between 1968 and 1973, and he was subjected to surveillance techniques that became increasingly intrusive. In the absence of membership of the government approved professional association it became hard to obtain materials, and for some time he operated without an official tax payer reference number. His perceived attitude in the great Formalism debate and his artistic style earned official condemnation. In the end, in December 1972, working under conditions of increasing privation from which his health suffered, he was able to arrange an evidently candid meeting with Konrad Wolf, the politically well connected president of the National Arts Academy, at which he spelled out his situation. The timing was propitious, in that the country's new leader, Erich Honecker, was cautiously trying to move the East German government beyond the unrelenting inflexibility of his predecessor. The exhibitions ban was lifted, and F√∂rster found himself elected to membership of the National Arts Academy. More generally, from now on, till the demise of the East German state in 1989/90, he became a (semi- detached and unconventional) member of the artistic establishment: his relationship with the state now reflected a certain level of mutual acceptance bordering on respect. Between 1979 and 1990 he served as fifth vice-president, with responsibility for the training of Master Students (\\"Meistersch√ºler\\") at the National Arts Academy. In 1985 he was appointed to a professorship. Since 1991 he has also been a member of PEN Centre Germany. However, 1991 was also the year in which he resigned from the (formerly East German) National Arts Academy in protest at the inadequacy of the institution's willingness to investigate and disclose its role under the East German dictatorship. Following reunification, in 1991 he was obliged to relocate from his 16 M2 studio to a small back yard which is where, despite by now suffering from serious heart disease, much of his later work was produced. For his larger sandstone sculptures he used a piece of land he had acquired (and where he still lives) at Wensickendorf near Oranienburg, to the north of Berlin. In 1992 or 2010 the National Arts Academy took over the Wieland F√∂rster Archive, comprising many pages his correspondence with fellow artists and with the authorities in East Germany. In 1996 he was a founding member of the Saxony Arts Academy in Dresden, to which in 2001 he agreed to donate 58 sculptures.  Output  F√∂rster was producing lithographic work from 1960. His first etchings and sculptures for public spaces appeared in 1962. During the years that followed he took several working trips abroad. His 1967 stay in Tunisia was particularly important in influencing his later work. However, foreign travel was a privilege rather than a right, and between 1968 and 1973 governmental agencies imposed various ideologically based blockages including the ban on exhibiting. Grudging rehabilitation, backed by Konrad Wolf, followed in 1974, when he was admitted to the National Arts Academy, and he was almost immediately able to stage his first major exhibition (organised by ) in Potsdam in the former observatory building on the Telegraph Hill. Wieland F√∂rster still works as a visual artist. Additionally, since the 1970s he has published a series of books and articles reflecting aspects of his own artistic creations.

While there is optimism about the growth of Indian publishing (especially in urban India), the sector is also afflicted by a lack of accurate figures about books published, knowledge shared and revenues earned. It is further divided between the local and multinational players, the English language and the local languages publishers. Self- publishing and immense free content, which is an offshoot of the digital revolution in print, further challenge the traditional ways of printing. The major players in Academic Publishing are Prentice Hall of India, Wiley India, Taylor and Francis India, New Age, Viva Books, TMH, Jaico and Manakin Press. Nielsen India study One recent study on Indian publishing was the Nielsen India Book Market Report 2015: Understanding the India Book Market, which is priced, and has been described as a \\"study\\" or \\"survey\\". News reports emerging based on this report claim that India ranks in second place among all countries as an English-language print book publisher, that it has some \\"9000 publishers\\" and that over 70% of Indian publishers have \\"digitised their content to produce ebook versions\\". The Indian publishing industry has grown over time and in 2017 was estimated at US $6.7 billion. Problems of Publishers According to media reports based on the Nielsen India report, some problems and challenges faced by book publishers in India include: * No direct investment from the government * Publishing and bookselling having a \\"fragmented nature\\" in India. * A \\"tortuous\\" distribution system. * Long credit cycles. * Difficulty to manage cash flows. * Increased direct costs due to the above. *Piracy and re-export of the low-priced editions to the first world markets. Technology in Publishing Technology has transformed the publishing industry since: *The first wave of typesetting and printing, making the process relatively faster, easier and cheaper. *Then the dissemination and outreach of information. * Social media is taking it ahead by increasing visibility and discoverability. * Online selling further closed the cycle (books account for 15% of ecommerce in the country, pegging growth at 20% annually). * Additionally, mobile libraries and Walking BookFairs have taken libraries to the remote areas.  ISBNs  ISBNs for books published in India are available free of cost from the Raja Rammohan Roy National Agency for ISBN, and since April 2016, online applications have to be made for the same. According to Kitaab.org \\"the agency claims to have issued ISBNs to 19,000 publishers since it was introduced in the country, in 1985.\\" However, it adds that the application process for ISBNs in India is \\"fraught with challenges for many publishers, especially those based outside Delhi\\" due to the delays involved in getting ISBN numbers (of up to three months), which are considered essential in the book publishing process, and also some difficulties in following up on applications.

Arrieta first studied to become a carpenter at a Salesian-run school but soon decided to become a priest with the order to which he was professed in 1902. He served at several Salesian houses for over the next decade until Pope Benedict XV appointed him as a bishop in late 1921. He was a prolific shepherd of souls; he underwent eight pastoral visitations to all his parishes and travelled far and wide to meet with his people and to launch a range of pastoral initiatives designed to rekindle the faith of the population. The late bishop's cause for sainthood commenced on 12 November 1990 under Pope John Paul II and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause culminated in 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and titled him as Venerable. Life Octavio Ortiz Arrieta was born on 19 April 1879 in Lima as the eighth of nine children to Manuel Arrieta and Benigna Coya. He studied as a carpenter under the Salesians of Don Bosco since December 1893 but soon decided to become a priest instead; but it was at this stage that his compatriots and superiors realized he possessed those qualities needed for the priesthood while Arrieta decided to become a priest under the Salesians. Father Pane once compiled a list of twelve names for potential Salesian vocations and upon reaching Arrieta's name figured he would make a good bishop sometime in the future. He joined the order for the novitiate on 24 May 1898 at Callao (initial profession followed in 1900) and made his perpetual profession in 1902 into the hands of Paolo Albera which made him the first Peruvian-born Salesian. Arrieta was assigned to found a new vocational school in Piura in 1906 and he was soon ordained to the priesthood at the beginning of 1907. He was appointed as the director of the Piura houses from 1911‚Äì15 and there founded the \\"La Campanilla\\" magazine. He went on to serve as the director of the houses at Cuzco (1915‚Äì20) and at Callao (1920‚Äì21) houses after his ordination where he served for well over a decade. Pope Benedict XV ‚Äì on 21 November 1921 ‚Äì appointed him into the episcopate as a bishop and he received his episcopal consecration on 11 June 1922 from Giuseppe Petrelli before he could be installed in his new see. From the November appointment it had taken him a month to reach his see from Lima and arrived sometime in December. He became noted for his closeness to the people and he organized a series of spiritual retreats for them. Arrieta also taught them catechism whenever it was possible for him to do so and also founded a diocesan newspaper for the faithful; he revitalized diocesan initiatives designed to restore the faith in the people and to empower them. He was a supporter of vocational initiatives and promoted them to empower prospective new priests and was a supporter of religious orders due to him being part of one himself. He was cheerful and welcoming and known for his amiable qualities; he undertook eight pastoral visitations and held three diocesan synods as well as reorganizing the archives of parishes. His travels were sometimes dangerous and on two occasions he suffered serious accidents that both ended up with him falling into deep ravines which confined him to hospital for prolonged periods due to broken ribs and bones. The bishop twice declined appointments to the Lima archdiocese because he wanted to remain close to his own people whom he had come to love and respect. The apostolic nuncio ‚Äì on the behalf of Pope Pius XII ‚Äì had made the offer to him but he said that he was \\"married\\" to his see. This did not stop the pope who in 1953 titled him as a Monsignor. His health started to decline into the 1950s and he died on 1 March 1958 after having had an operation around that time. He was interred in the diocesan cathedral. Beatification cause The cause for his beatification opened on 12 November 1990 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled him as a Servant of God once it issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against). The diocesan phase for beatification occurred in the late bishop's diocese from 8 July 1992 until it was closed a decade later on 22 December 2001 at which stage all documentation was sent to the C.C.S. who validated the process on 3 October 2003. The Positio dossier was sent to the C.C.S. for their assessment at which stage it was passed onto the theological advisors who approved the dossier's contents on 19 February 2015. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. approved this sometime later on 14 February 2017. Pope Francis titled Arrieta as Venerable on 27 February 2017 after confirming that the late bishop had led a model life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Salesian priest Pierluigi Cameroni.

During this period of colonial Singapore, many Chinese immigrants moved into Singapore due to their own population boom back in China and they were looking for better economic opportunities. The streets were full of activities as the different communities had started to take root in their own settlements. These communities brought to Singapore cultural activities such as operas, circuses, gambling and economic activities such as stock and commodity trading. The architectural history of Singapore likewise flourished during this period to accommodate to the increased demand from the ever- growing, cosmopolitan and wealthy population. Buildings were built to provide housing, amenities and entertainment for various classes of elites and workers. Background The Cantonese opera house, located on Smith Street, was built in the 1887. Its surrounding streets are Temple Street and Trengganu Street. It was owned by Lin Dingxing and subsequently, Loh Ghim. Opera performances to the Chinese have religious significance as they believe it entertains the gods and spirits. Hence, people from all dialects visited the opera house. The opera house was designed in the style of a traditional three levels Chinese teahouse with balconies. There are small tables on the first level for the audiences. The stage was located on the second floor. This was designed by Regent Alfred Bidwell from Swan and Maclaren and his portfolio includes Raffles Hotel and Stamford House. His works are prominent as he considered the usage of the buildings for the clients and clientele. The opera house was able to accommodate 834 audiences. It was a well-frequented opera house as it provided a form of entertainment for the immigrants. The popularity of the opera house is evident by its twice daily plays. The shop houses surrounding the opera house are also three stories high, there are Baroque-style shop houses as well as Chinese-style shop houses in this area. The Baroque-style shop houses were probably designed or inspired by Henry Richard in 1886 as he designed the neighbouring Sago Street's shop houses in 1886. These shop houses provided a form of lifestyle for the locals as they could do their commercial businesses right beneath their homes. The theatre had also brought businesses to the owners of the shop houses as the audiences would frequent the area. The architecture design followed that of Chinese buildings ‚Äì decorated corbel brackets, architrave tie ends, steps and door nail studs. Other opera houses, such as Heng Wai Sun and Heng Seng Peng Opera Houses, which were located mainly on Wayang Street in Singapore, could not be compared to Lai Chun Yuen as well. Even though ‚ÄúWayang Street‚Äù was ‚ÄúTheatre Street‚Äù translated from Malay, it was not the hub of the entertainment business. The main entertainment district was on Smith Street. Lai Chun Yuen Opera House was able to attract many famous Cantonese performers such as Leng Yuen Hung, Ma Si Chang and Hung Sin Nui in the early 1900s. Famous performers could earn up to 450 to 700 dollars a day, which was a hefty sum for that era. According to a visitor, no other places in Singapore could be compared with the Lai Chun Yuen Opera House. However, the place was the epitome of vice as Smith Street was the red-light district back then. There were private cubicles designed for discreet activities and opium smoking was a common sight in the theatre. The Chinese considered opium smoking normal and in 1848, Singapore has 15,000 Chinese opium smokers. This represented one-third of the adult Chinese population. Ironically, the theatre would sometimes be used for fund- raising activities for campaigns such as ‚ÄúCanton Flood Relief Fund‚Äù. These activities were huge successes as they were able to hire famous performers. Hence, the Opera House was able to raise funds from the public tickets and by auctioning off performer‚Äôs items, which were well received. Geography Trengganu Street was a crowded and busy street filled with market and street vendors. This street was meant for Teo Chews but it was frequently visited by all dialects due to the opera house. This street was called ‚Äúthe cross street of Kreta Ayer‚Äù in Chinese, referring to its strategic location in Kreta Ayer. Later, the street was also given the nickname ‚Äúhei yuen wang gai‚Äù meaning ‚Äútheatre side street‚Äù by the Chinese. The shop houses along this street had housed Malay families during the war and during which, the families sold exotic ‚Äútonic dishes‚Äù using animals like lizards and crocodiles. Today, Trengganu Street is the heart of tourist belt in Chinatown and it is the most photographed street. It remained crowded and bustling till this day. The other neighbouring street of the Opera House is Temple Street. The name of the street used to be Almeida Street, named after Joaquim d‚ÄôAlmeida, whose father owned some plots of land at the junction of Temple Street and Trengganu Street. It was changed to Temple Street by the Municipal Commissioners to avoid confusions as there were other streets named after d‚ÄôAlmeida. The ‚ÄúTemple‚Äù in Temple Street refers to the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore, the Sri Mariamman Temple which was built in 1827. Likewise, the Chinese had nicknamed the street ‚Äúhei yuen hau kai‚Äù, meaning ‚Äútheatre back street‚Äù as Temple Street runs through the back of the opera house. Smith Street was also given nicknames by the Chinese. The most common nicknames were ‚Äúhei yuen kai‚Äù which means ‚Äútheatre street‚Äù and ‚Äúgu chia chui hi hng poi‚Äù which means ‚Äútheatre street in Kreta Ayer in Hokkien. The street was most probably named after Sir Cecil Clementi Smith, who was the Commander-in-chief of the Straits Settlements. The street was filled with no fewer than 25 brothels on the street. However, Lai Chun Yuen was the main landmark on Smith Street.  Transformation  In the late 1920s, movies were invented and introduced to the world. This had greatly impacted Lai Chun Yuen‚Äôs business as people preferred ‚Äútalking films‚Äù as compared to opera shows. The increased in cinema halls in amusement parks like the Great World City was a competition to the opera house. The owner of the opera house wanted to include a movie room to ensure the opera house‚Äôs survival but eventually the opera house was rented to the Shaw Brothers and the opera house was renamed Sun Seng Theatre. Opera House Hotel Lai Chun Yuen However, the business did not last long as the theatre was bombed during World War II. Much of the building was destroyed and the building was only repaired after the war. After the restorations, the building was used for a merchandise shop and then a warehouse for street hawkers as there was a need for jobs back then. In recent years, the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation (Singapore) occupied the building before the current Santa Grand Hotel. A brief interview with the hotel manager, Christine Hoo, revealed that the hotel leases the building from the Royal Holdings. The hotel reflects the Concept Plan as the area is zoned for commercial purposes. The reason for this is probably due to Singapore Tourism Board‚Äôs push for place-making initiatives, such as festivals, in Chinatown. As such, Chinatown is one of the major tourist destinations in Singapore and hence, there is the demand for a hotel. The strategic location of hotel is often praised by the hotel guests. Current Tregganu Street As the Lai Chun Yuen Opera House is located within the current Kreta Ayer Conservation Area, its surroundings buildings has not changed much, in fact, they are all conserved for adaptive reuse. The street names have also been kept. For example, the five-foot way the area is still used by vendors (Figure 10), just like the past. However, instead of market vendors selling food, these vendors sell souvenirs and they are frequented more by tourists than locals.  Current building  Changes were made to the interior of the building. The small cubicles used for private activities back in the opera days have been converted into hotel rooms, escalators were built for ease of moving between floors and steel structures were installed from ground to ceiling to maintain the building as well as to prevent potential injuries from the old building. The biggest change to the hotel is that the stage on the second floor has been torn down and replaced by a sitting area in the hotel for the guests. This was done as the current owner of Lai Chun Yuen felt that he should use the space in the hotel. Hotel Rooms The hotel has artifacts and paintings from the Chinese opera. However, the artefacts were not from the original Lai Chun Yuen Opera House, but bought and designed by the current hotel owner, Opera House Hotel. There are also information boards all around the hotel educating the guests on Chinese opera. As such, numerous curious guests and passer-by have also approached the manager to enquire on the history of the hotel. Although this is most attention that the opera house would receive ‚Äì passing curiosity. Despite scholarly and news articles written on it, it is still not widely known or recognised. The hotel does not hold opera plays. They used to hold Chinese arts performances but it was hard to recoup the costs due to the high cost of inviting performers and most of the time, people did not appreciate the opera plays. Mediacorp visits the hotel occasionally to film Chinese New Year music videos or shows. Kreta Ayer People‚Äôs Theatre also commemorated Chinese arts performances since its formation in the 1960s. The theatre is located at the nearby Kreta Ayer Road and numerous shows, including Chinese opera, are played there. Hence, Chinese arts have not been lost in transition.  Conclusion  The use of buildings or streets evolves over time to suit the changing needs of the people. Lai Chun Yuen opera house has been an icon of entertainment, a storage place for the merchandisers, an office for a foundation and now it is a home for tourists away from their homes. Although it no longer serves its purpose of an entertainment house, it still has significance. Also, a building cannot exist on its own. This changing use for the needs of the people can be seen in the surrounding streets as well. This connection between the building and the streets is important as it gives life to Chinatown.

Modiolus auriculatus Description Modiolus auriculatus has an equivalve shell with each valve being inequilateral with their beaks being very close to the anterior end. The shell is the typical mussel form with the ligament and dorsal margins distinctly disjunct and the dorsal and ventral margins being parallel; the dorsal margin is concave. The shell has a smooth with growth lines and the covering periostracum is pubescent. The outer surfaces of the shell is olive-brownish or orange-brown and the shell interior is browny-purple. The commonly grow to a shell size of 70mm. Distribution Modiolus auriculatus occurs naturally in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean from the Red Sea south to South Africa, east to eastern Polynesia, north as far as Japan and south to Australia. It was first recorded in Suez Canal in the 1900s and in the Mediterranean in 1935 off the coast of Palestine most likely after the planktonic larvae had travelled through the Suez Canal. Its Mediterranean distribution is still largely restricted to the coast off Israel where it is not uncommon. Biology Modiolus auriculatus is not restricted to a single specific habitat, it is commonest in rocky habitats and least common in areas which contain rocky sand and algae. It is often associated with small holes in rocky shores, especially on the seaward edge of sea grass beds and at the landward margin of ridges vegetated with algae. In the Red Sea spawning individuals were found throughout the year but with a peak in March through to June/July and all sexually mature individuals had a shell length in excess of 30mm.

Synopsis Maxime Perepelitsa is a cheerful and quick-witted guy from a Ukrainian village, well-known personality in his native town. He has a fantastic ability to invent all sorts of stories and take time off from work. Having received a summons to the army, wishing to \\"protect\\" himself against potential rivals, he sends pumpkins to all the guys in the village on behalf of his beloved girl Maroussi ‚Äì this is a traditional rejection of courtship in Ukraine which ends up causing a stir in the village. The kolkhoz assembly even wants to deprive Perepelitsa of his honorable duty to serve in the Soviet Army, but Maksim gives his word to correct his behavior. In the army he dodges responsibility when trying to avoid the difficulties of service, but here his trick is out of turn and is arrested in the guardhouse. However his flexible character and good-natured personality make him pliable in re-education. Showing himself as smart and having initiative during a training exercise, he gets the rank of junior sergeant, shows true heroism in his native village during the holidays, and Maroussia finally reciprocates his feelings.

Built in 1918 by a member of the prominent Alkaff family as a weekend house, it became known for hosting high society parties in the 1930s. After World War 2, the house was abandoned. The mansion served as the headquarters of the World Buddhist Society from around 1970 to 1984 before it was redeveloped into a restaurant and party venue in the 1990s. The property was then returned to the government in 2004 upon closure of the restaurant. Left vacant for a number of years, the mansion was given a new lease of life when an Italian restaurant occupied the premises in 2011, until it ceased operations in 2016. In Dec 2018, the tender of Alkaff mansion was awarded to Jardin Enchante Pte Ltd by the Singapore Land Authority. \\"The Alkaff Mansion\\" under the 1-Group collective of lifestyle F&B; concepts, will now house three concepts, a Spanish Restaurant named UNA (previously at One Rochester), Txa (Pintxos Bar), and Wildseed Cafe. The Alkaff Mansion is slated to begin operations and will be open to the public between April ‚Äì May 2019. History Before 1916 The area known as Telok Blangah Hill today was known as Mount Washington in the early 20th century. A European house was already constructed on the site surrounded by rubber and coconut trees before the plot of land was purchased by Syed Abdul Rahman bin Abdullah Alkaff in 1916. 1918‚Äì1930s In 1918, the mansion with its distinctive architecture was constructed. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the mansion hosted many social functions that included people of various races and social classes. These functions had a role in strengthening inter-communal bonds. In 1930, a newspaper report mentions that the mansion was used by an organization called the \\"Young Arabs\\" to host a team of amateur Malay footballers who recently won the 1930 Singapore Cup. This event was explicitly reported to be one hosted to help relieve Arab-Malay tensions and bolster Muslim solidarity following a recent misunderstanding. In 1936, the Chinese community, through the Chinese Consul General, made full use of the building to host a visiting general and provincial governor from China. In this function, a dinner was held and attended by people of various linguistic groups (to the point of necessitating a translator). A press conference was also held, whereby the Chinese governor expressed his \\"appreciation of the unity of the Chinese in Singapore\\". These events which cut across racial lines are significant as they call into question the theories of Colonial scholar John Sydenham Furnivall, who argued that British ruled colonial societies were 'plural societies' ‚Äì societies divided along communal lines that only converged at the market place, or in violence and instability once the ambit of British colonial power was gone. The various communities, far from being totally segregated met at the mansion, and such meetings were entirely spontaneous without explicit support of the British. The antecedents of \\"racial and religious harmony\\" which dominates race discourse in present-day Singapore, thus found expression in the mansion. The mansion also served as a space that empowered women. In a 1936 newspaper section called \\"Women's interests\\", an article written by a lady who expressed her deep impressions of the mansion. In her account, women regularly served as joint hosts with their husbands in various social functions. This is contrasted starkly against the fact that women were, at the same time banned from other areas like the \\"sacred precincts of the Swimming club\\". In a time of patriarchy, such a role could be seen as an example where women were not mere inert members of society, but active ones who made good use of their agency. The writer also listed the various women who attended social gatherings, often with descriptions of how they gracefully conducted themselves. In one occasion, the author even praised the musical skills of a female guest. The mansion thus served as a site where women could find their voice and express themselves ‚Äì notions which are often elusive in male- dominated histories. Circa 1942‚Äì1970s What happened to the mansion during the Japanese occupation years and its aftermath remain relatively unknown. During the war, Telok Blangah Hill was located along the same ridge that hosted the climactic Battle of Pasir Panjang. One could wager a guess that the mansion was abandoned for safety reasons. In any case, the mansion was abandoned after the war. According to the heritage description plaque found at the mansion today, the house was sold as the Alkaffs were facing severe business losses. The identity of those who took over the mansion is unknown. Following the sale of the mansion, the heritage plaque immediately moves on to mention that the mansion was acquired by the government in 1984. Not only is such information misleading, it also masks the incredibly rich history of the building in the intermediate years. The mansion was in fact taken over by a Buddhist organization called the \\"World Buddhist Society\\". The exact date in which they moved in is unknown, but it is most likely after the year 1972 as a newspaper report on the mansion during that year mentions that the mansion was still abandoned. In any case, pictorial evidence will show that the World Buddhist Society had installed their signboard onto the front fa√ßade of the building. According to various oral history interviews, the society managed 2 temples ‚Äì one in the immediate vicinity at Telok Blangah Hill, and another bigger one called \\"Thousand Buddha Temple\\" at Mount Faber. The organization also managed a statue of the Buddha at Telok Blangah Hill. These oral histories, tell us that these temples were prominent places of worship that proved to also be a popular tourist destination. According to one interviewees, tourists would visit the temples after climbing up Mount Faber. Other transnational linkages were forged by the World Buddhist Society. Several newspaper reports mention that the society was to conduct various international conferences annually with other Buddhist societies worldwide. Moreover, the World Buddhist Society also served as the umbrella organization for the World Buddhist College, an educational institution which, according to newspaper reports, aimed to \\"train all Buddhist monks in Singapore\\". Taken as a whole, the mansion could thus be said to be a nexus that played an educational role, and where transnational linkages were forged between Buddhist societies worldwide. 1984 These activities would however, come to an end in 1984. As part of the government's plan to redevelop the area for recreational purposes, the temples were slated for to be demolished. The society appealed by the government to incorporate their temples and society into the redevelopment plan, but was rejected as the government claimed that the area was to be used for 'recreational' purposes only. As such, the society vacated the area, had their temples and statues demolished, and relocated elsewhere. The mansion, however, survived, albeit in an abandoned state. 1987 In 1987, the mansion was formally included into plans for redevelopment for the purpose of tourism. Notwithstanding the earlier claims that the temples and the mansion were popular among tourists visiting the area, the mansion was to undergo renovation and redevelopment. The tender to restore and manage the mansion was awarded to Hotel Properties Ltd. A series of photographs stored in the National Archive of Singapore show that the building was developed in a way that maintained its fa√ßade: the distinctive turrets remained in place, and the steps of the terrace were retained and refurnished. 1990‚Äì2005 The mansion was to be turned into a restaurant and the tender was awarded to Hotel Properties Ptd Ltd, who decided that the restaurant serve rijstaffel, a cuisine that combined Dutch and Indonesian culinary elements. The mansion enjoyed a period of popularity as a place for weddings, and other social functions. According to media reports, the restaurant ceased operations in 2003, and ownership of the mansion was returned to the state. Newspaper reports also speculate that the economic crisis of 2001 and the SARs epidemic in 2003 had caused its downfall. In 2005, the mansion was accorded conservation status by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). As such, the fa√ßade and architecture of the mansion has since been guaranteed to be preserved. 2010‚Äì2016 Tender for the mansion was auctioned in 2010 and was won by the firm LHN. The mansion underwent another round of renovations and in 2011, the \\"Alkaff Mansion Ristorante\\" serving Italian cuisine was opened. Despite recognition in Michelin publications, skepticism in the restaurant's ability to continue business was expressed in a media report in March 2016. The restaurant would eventually cease operations in July 2016. The restaurant may have overestimated the commercial value of the mansion: it agreed to pay a monthly rental three times the guide amount during the auction of 2010. 2018‚Äìpresent The Singapore Land Authority took over the property from LHN in 2016 and in 2018 released a tender to curate concepts and lease out the property for the next decade. The mansion was eventually awarded to Jardin Enchante Pte Ltd (operating under the name of 1-Group which owned various other concepts like Monti, Botanico, 1-Altitude, Bee's Knees, Stellar, etc.) in January 2019. \\"The Alkaff Mansion\\" under the 1-Group's Heritage Properties Portfolio, houses three concepts, an award- winning Spanish Restaurant named UNA (previously at One Rochester), an authentic San Sebastian styled Pintxo Bar called Txa, and a popular alfresco floral cafe called Wildseed Cafe (the first outlet is in The Summerhouse). The Alkaff Mansion's lower courtyard was also renamed \\"The Grounds of Alkaff\\". The Alkaff Mansion and all its concepts started operation on 21 April 2019. By the 10th of May, Alkaff Mansion had already hosted the highest level Ministry of Foreign Affair's meeting between Singapore and Italy and executed a romantic sell-out Wedding Fair organised by 1-Host on. It will also be hosting various guests from the World's 50 Best Restaurant award in Singapore in June 2019.  Conservation  Alkaff Mansion is located on Telok Blangah Hill, which together with Mount Faber(http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_29_2005-01-25.html), forms part of the Southern Ridges in thesouthwest of Singapore. As both hills were important battle sites during the Japanese invasion of Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1569_2009-09-18.html) (URA) awarded the area conservation status on 9 June 2005. According to URA's conservation guidelines, Alkaff Mansion's fa√ßade, including the canopy, porch, windows and balustrades, must be retained and restored as part of any redevelopment.  Design features  Arts and Crafts-influenced main facade Alkaff Mansion's key design features include broad stairways and European- style fountains in front of its main entrance. The outdoor area is adorned with a water feature, sundials and gazebos, while the mansion is surrounded by a white stone balustrade featuring English motifs. The mansion looks bigger than it is, possibly due to the turrets on either side of its fa√ßade. The ground floor consists of a porch that extends into an elongated and narrow room, where the Alkaffs had their meals in the past. There is another porch fronting a room on the second floor with three other bedrooms occupying the remaining space. During its days of high-society revelry, the mansion's interior walls had elaborate designs engraved on them, while the tiles on the floor and in the toilets featured colourful flower patterns.

Given its multidisciplinary nature, IBAC aims to bring together biologists from different specialisms. as well as engineers, sound archivists, computer scientists and other interested parties to foster discussion, share knowledge and exchange ideas surrounding the subject of vocal communication in animals. History IBAC emerged from earlier initiatives such as the International Committee for Bioacoustics (ICBA) which was formed in the USA in 1956. This short-lived organisation was replaced by the Enregistrements et Etudes des Chants et Cris d'Oiseaux (Institute ECHO) which was founded in France by Jean-Claude and Helen Roch√© in 1967. The primary aims of Institute ECHO were to make and publish wildlife sound recordings, organise research meetings and conferences, promote the scientific and musicological study of wildlife sounds and mount scientific expeditions. In 1969, Institute ECHO abandoned its scientific activities in order to concentrate on its publishing programme. In response to this change in focus, members interested in the scientific study of wildlife sounds decided to form IBAC IBAC aims The rules of IBAC state the following core purposes: * To further the science of bioacoustics by the holding of congresses and by setting up task forces to examine specialist areas. * To encourage and effect liaison between amateurs and professionals working in bioacoustics. * To encourage students to take part in IBAC's activities. IBAC activities IBAC supports the sharing of recent research outputs and technological advancements through its biennial conferences, a list serve, a Facebook group and a website. From 1971 to 1983 IBAC published Biophon, an informal journal which featured scientific articles, equipment reviews and information on forthcoming bioacoustics events. Two special issues were published in 1996 and 1997. A complete set of the journal is available for consultation at the British Library. Conferences Since its formation in 1969, IBAC has held 25 conferences in 12 different countries. The first conference was held in Kinross, Scotland in 1971. The first IBAC conference to occur outside Europe was held at the Center for Bioacoustics at Texas A&M; University in October 1997. Other venues have included Brazil (2003). The next conference will be held in October 2017 in Haridwar, India.

Early life He was born in Paisley on 15 March 1765, the son of Joseph Thomson, a silk-weaver from Kinross, and his wife Mary Millar. worked as a boy under different masters for about three years, and at 11 he was bound apprentice to his father for seven years. At the end of his term of service his father intended him for the ministry, but was persuaded to apprentice him in 1785 to Dr. John White of Paisley, with whom he remained for three years. Thomson entered the University of Glasgow in the winter session of 1788‚Äì9, and the following year moved to Edinburgh. He was appointed assistant apothecary at the Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, in September 1790, and in the following September he became house-surgeon there, title surgeon's clerk, having already filled the port of assistant physician's clerk. He became a member of the Edinburgh Medical Society at the beginning of the winter session in 1790‚Äì1, and next year was elected one of its presidents. On 31 July 1792 Thomson, in poor health, resigned his appointment and went to London, where he studied at John Hunter's school of medicine in Leicester Square. On his return to Edinburgh, early in 1793, Thomson became a fellow of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, funded by James Hog, manager of the Paisley Bank. Until autumn 1798 he lived with the surgeon James Arrott, and attended the Royal Infirmary as a surgeon. During this time he studied chemistry, and ran a class during the winter of 1799‚Äì1800 which met in his home. In 1800 he was nominated one of the six surgeons to the Royal Infirmary under a reorganisation, and soon began teaching surgery. He also lectured in Chemistry. At this point he was living at Merchant Street in Edinburgh, close to Greyfriars Kirk.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1801-2 He also gave a course of lectures on for military surgeons; and visited London in the autumn 1803 to be appointed a hospital mate in the Army, a qualification to take charge of a military hospital in case of invasion. Edinburgh professor The College of Surgeons of Edinburgh established a professorship of surgery in 1805, and, in spite of opposition, Thomson was appointed to the post. In 1806, at the suggestion of Earl Spencer, the Home Secretary, the King appointed him professor of military surgery in the University of Edinburgh. On 11 January 1808 Thomson obtained the degree of MD from the University and King's College, Aberdeen. In 1810 Thomson resigned his post at the Royal Infirmary, after the managers ignored criticism of his surgery by John Bell. He continued to lecture, however. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1812.His proposers were John Playfair, Thomas Thomson and Sir George Steuart Mackenzie. He was further elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1824. In summer 1814 toured medical schools in Europe. He was admitted a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh on 7 February 1815: he was now acting as a consulting physician as well as a consulting surgeon. That summer he was again on the continent of Europe, and observed the treatment of the wounded after the Battle of Waterloo. In September 1815 Thomson was mainly instrumental in founding the Edinburgh New Town dispensary. He delivered a course of lectures on diseases of the eye in the summer of 1819, paving the way for the establishment of the first eye infirmary in Edinburgh in 1824. He was engaged during 1822‚Äì6 in the study of general pathology, and in 1821 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the chair of the practice of physic in the university, vacant after the death of James Gregory. In 1828‚Äì9 and again in 1829‚Äì30 he delivered a course of lectures on the practice of physic, both courses being given with his son, William Thomson (1802‚Äì1852). Last years In 1831 Thomson addressed to Lord Melbourne, then secretary of state for the home department, a memorial on the advantages of a separate chair of general pathology. A commission was issued in his favour, and he was appointed professor of general pathology at Edinburgh, giving his first course of lectures in the winter session of 1832‚Äì3. Repeated attacks of illness compelled him to discontinue visits to patients after the summer 1835. He resigned his professorship in 1841: the duties had long been performed by deputy. He died at Morland Cottage, near the foot of Blackford Hill on the south side of Edinburgh, on 11 October 1846. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh. The grave lies in the western extension against the far west wall. Works Thomson wrote many pamphlets, and other works including: *The Elements of Chemistry and Natural History, to which is prefixed the Philosophy of Chemistry by M. Fourcroy, translated with notes, vol. i. Edinburgh, 1798, vol. ii. 1799, vol. iii. 1800; the work reached a fifth edition. *Observations on Lithotomy, with a new Manner of Cutting for Stone, Edinburgh, 1808. An appendix was issued in 1810. The original work and the appendix were translated into French, Paris, 1818. *Lectures on Inflammation: a View of the general Doctrines of Medical Surgery, Edinburgh, 1813; issued in America, Philadelphia, 1817, and again in 1831; translated into German, Halle, 1820, and into French, Paris, 1827. This influential series of lectures was based on the Hunterian theory of inflammation. The smallpox epidemic of 1817‚Äì18 showed that vaccination was not as protective as had been supposed, and Thomson published views on the subject in two pamphlets of 1820 and 1822. He wrote a biography of William Cullen, and also edited The Works of William Cullen, M.D., Edinburgh, 1827, 2 vols. Family Thomson was twice married: first, in 1793, to Margaret Crawford, second daughter of John Gordon of Caroll in Sutherlandshire; she died early in 1804; and secondly, in 1806, to Margaret, third daughter of John Millar. There were three children by the first marriage, the only survivor being William who went on to be Professor of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. From the second marriage Allen Thomson and Margaret Mylne outlived childhood. He was grandfather to John Millar Thomson FRSE.

History Basil L. Spangler, born in 1817, was a dry-goods merchant from Cleveland who ran his own form, B. L. Spangler and Company. In 1856, Spangler commissioned William Jones, a shipbuilder from Black River Ohio (now Lorain), to construct a schooner. The schooner was named Kyle Spangler, after Spangler's son, born in 1851. The ship was launched on May 12, 1856, and departed Cleveland with a cargo of coal two days later. The Spangler was a traditional mid-nineteenth century cargo schooner that hauled various cargoes on the freshwater Great Lakes, and on to saltwater ports along the east coast. including iron ore, salt, coal, corn and wheat. Like many schooners of the time, the Spangler endured a series of shipping incidents. In May 1856 she tore a hole in her bottom on a reef in Lake Huron. In 1857, she spring a leak in Lake Michigan, and was run aground just south of Sleeping Bear Bay before she sank. It was almost a year before she was refloated. The ship was dismasted in 1858, and later that same year collided with another schooner in the Straits of Mackinac. In 1859, the Spangler sailed into the Atlantic Ocean with a load of lumber, and returned the following spring. On November 5, 1860, while upbound on Lake Huron on a dark night with a load of corn, the Spangler collided with the downbound schooner Racine, crushing the Spangler's bow and sinking her. All crewmen were rescued safely. The wreck The wreck was discovered in 2003 by diver Stan Stock while searching for the semi-whaleback freighter Choctaw. Over the next few years, Stock and a team from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration‚Äôs Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary documented the wreck. In 2008, it was decided to release the location of the wreck to the general public, and the location has become a popular scuba diving attraction. The Kyle Spangler lies upright in 185 feet (56.4 meters) of water, and much of the wreck is undamaged save the bow. The cold, fresh water of Lake Huron has kept the wreck well preserved, and the ship looks much as she did during the 1850s, with both masts (including crosstrees) intact and upright. The wreck lists twenty degrees to the starboard side. The ship's wheel, steering gear and rudder are intact, as are two bilge pumps and the main winch and capstan. The interior cabin structure is relatively intact, but the woodwork has collapsed, making small items difficult to discern. The cargo hold hatch covers are displaced, giving easy access to the hold.

Shortly after Des left the band and was replaced by Dave [Vocals], the new line up went onto record and release the next instalment of Virus's discography, You Can‚Äôt Ignore It Forever in December 1984. In 1985 Des rejoined Virus to create a five piece that went on to support the likes of Subhumans, Anthrax (UK band), Organised Chaos, Disorder, The Varukers, Conflict, Liberty, Culture Shock & Zounds. Virus contributed a track to the Mortarhate compilation album, We Won‚Äôt Be Your Fucking Poor before splitting in the summer of 1986. In 1996 Virus reformed with Charlie Barber on drums for one of gig. The reformation was an attempt to rekindle interest in the band but logistically it was difficult as Jaz lived in Reading and Bowzer in France. The audience reaction was also not particularly favourable so this reformation was short-lived. After Ian Glasper included Virus in, The Day The Country Died original members, Dave & Jaz, started the band again with a new guitarist, Rich Hoskins and drummer, Mark Smith.

It is located approximately north of Balgo and south of Halls Creek in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The name of the station is taken from a pool in Sturt Creek found and mentioned by Alfred Canning when he mapped out the Canning Stock Route in 1907. The Billiluna Pastoral Company Limited, previously known as Sturt Creek Pastoral Company Limited, was registered in 1920. In 1922 the station manager, Joseph Condren, was shot dead and an employee named Tim O'Sullivan was shot in the thigh by a Bilingara youth, in retribution for the fact that O'Sullivan had abducted his wife for sexual purposes and refused to allow her to return to her husband. O'Sullivan later died and by the time Mr Barry, the manager of nearby Sturt Creek Station, had arrived to investigate he found two graves and the homestead looted of all firearms and ammunition. A young boy was sent with a threatening message for any white men who attempted to follow the perpetrators. A few months later a policeman, Constable Flinders, attempted to apprehend the suspect at his camp on Boolka Creek on Bohemia Downs Station. The suspect, named Banjo, was shot and killed during the arrest. In October of that year, more than a dozen Aboriginal people from the Kutjungka region were killed by police in the Sturt Creek massacre in a punitive expedition led by Constable J.J.Cooney in response to the attacks on Condren and O'Sullivan. The property was placed on the market in 1925 as part of a deceased estate. At this time it occupied an area of and had two wells in addition to good surface water sources. Buildings included a two-room house, beef house and harness house. Four sets of yards had also been built along with a fenced horse paddock. It was stocked with 2,500 head of cattle and about 40 horses. An Armstrong Siddeley was the first car to be driven to Billiluna as part of an trip through the Kimberley. The vehicle was landed at Derby and driven to the shores of Lake Gregory at Billiluna via Sturt Creek Station over of trackless country. The Canning Stock Route was closed early in 1925 after falling into disuse as a result of stockmen being attacked by Aborigines. Stock from Billiluna had to be transported via Wyndham instead of overlanding using the track. The Billiluna Pastoral Company requested the track be reopened but the government claimed it would cost ¬£5,625 and take six months to repair and refused. In the early twentieth century, Billiluna stock was moved through and along the Canning Stock Route to the south. In 2013 the lease was held by the Aboriginal Lands Trust and managed by Mark Gordon.

For the 40th anniversary live episode, Emmerdale announced that a character would die, and that character was Carl King (played by Tom Lister), who was hit with a brick by his love rival Cameron Murray (Dominic Power). The episode also featured a wedding and two births. Behind-the-scenes footage was also included. Production To celebrate Emmerdale's 40th anniversary, it was announced on 1 May 2012 that the show would have its first-ever live episode.'Emmerdale' live episode confirmed for 40th anniversary Digital Spy, 1 May 2012 On 25 June 2012, it was announced that Tony Prescott, who directed the 50th anniversary live episode of Coronation Street in December 2010 would direct the episode. On 23 July it was reported that an ITV2 backstage show, Emmerdale Uncovered: Live, would be broadcast after the live episode. On 14 August, it was announced that the production team was building a new Woolpack set for the live episode. Although Emmerdale village and interior sets are miles apart, its producers wanted The Woolpack to feature in the live episode. On 6 September, it was confirmed that the One-hour live episode would include an unexpected death, two weddings and two births. Emmerdale Live aired on 17 October 2012, in the middle of the 40th anniversary week, with the death revealed to be Carl King's. Rehearsals Rehearsals for the live episode started one week in advance. During rehearsals, Stephen Mulhern pre-recorded some rehearsals and interviewed some of the cast and crew for the aftershow which aired straight after on ITV2 at 8 pm. Opening sequence A new opening sequence was used, consisting of an aerial view of the church, zooming in to Carl King (Tom Lister) sitting alone on the grass with dried blood covering his face; Chas (Lucy Pargeter) and Dan Spencer (Liam Fox) preparing to sign the marriage forms; Declan Macey (Jason Merrells) and Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) arriving at their wedding reception; Carl's bruised brother Jimmy (Nick Miles) walking across a bridge in distress following their showdown in the previous episode; Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) looking out his bedroom window; Gennie Walker (Sian Reese-Williams) going into labour; Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb) getting loaded into the back of an ambulance; and a high-up view of the village. Plot =Part 1= As Chas and Dan sign the register, Carl arrives at the church. Carl is livid that Chas has fooled him and follows as the congregation leave the church. He then confronts Chas but is distracted when he receives a call from Cameron. Katie and Declan have their first dance as Megan Macey (Gaynor Faye) arrives. Zak Dingle (Steve Halliwell) and Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) sit in the corridor at the hospital. Cain thanks Zak for calming Debbie. Chas is keen to get in the camper van and leave, but Dan announces that he has planned a surprise wedding reception for her. Debbie asks after Cameron at the hospital, Zak tells her that he has left another message for him. Cameron sits alone in the church waiting for Carl to arrive. A panicked Chas makes a quick excuse to leave the wedding reception and rushes to the pub in an attempt to calm herself. Nicola runs into a bloody Jimmy but he yells at her and walks off claiming he doesn't want to talk. The guests at the wedding reception discuss Chas's odd behaviour. Chas starts to pack her things into a bag as Carl walks into the church. =Part 2= Cameron and Carl threaten each other. Katie tells Megan that Robbie Lawson (Jamie Shelton) knew about their scam. As their argument progresses, Cameron picks up a candlestick to hit Carl with, but bottles it. Carl laughs and leaves. Diane catches Chas in tears at the pub, when Dan walks in. Chas begs Dan to get in the van and leave with her. Gennie's waters break. A livid Dan refuses to leave with Chas, thinking that she regrets marrying him. She promises to explain once they leave the village, but he refuses to leave the kids. He gives her the keys to his van and leaves. Debbie tries to get hold of Cameron again but her phone battery is dying. With Gennie about to give birth, Nikhil Sharma (Rik Makarem) ends the wedding reception, clearing people out of the B&B.; Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw) decides they should all crash the marquee. Chas sneaks down to the camper van and attempts to start it but Carl blocks her way. =Part 3= Carl confronts Chas over what she has done. Debbie gives birth to a baby boy. Gennie is in the last stages of birth as Nikhil helps via a birthing app on his phone. As the baby arrives, Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) catches it as Nikhil faints. The midwife begins to deliver Debbie's placenta, crucial to Sarah's survival. Robbie arrives at the marquee and Megan confronts him. Chas tries to convince Carl that they can both remain in the village and kisses him. He invites her to sleep with him in the camper van. Disgusted and terrified, Chas plays along and climbs into the back with him. Robbie chases after Megan, trying to explain his actions, he apologises referring to her as \\"mum\\" for the first time. Carl, lying on top of a sickened Chas, gets her to remove her wedding ring. Debbie holds the baby for the first time. Chas shoves Carl away as he goes to pull down the straps on her dress, telling him she can't do it. Carl admits his surprise, thinking she'd go further along with the game before crying off. Chas attempts to leave, but Carl grabs her. Debbie feels like she's pushed Cameron away. A dazed Nihkil comes around and sees his daughter for the first time. As the two grapple outside, Chas becomes horrified when Carl finally reveals that he himself killed his father Tom King (Ken Farrington); ranting that he did it for her and he won't let her walk away from him again. Chas slaps Carl and tries again to leave, but Carl brings her down onto the floor as Chas screams for him to get off; she soon reaches out for a brick and hits him on the head, injuring Carl. =Part 4= As a distressed Chas runs away from Carl, Cameron notices her and investigates as to what she is running from. Diane gets off the phone with Debbie and tells Ashley that they've decided to call the baby boy Jack Sugden. Chas rushes back into the pub. Carl, still wounded from Chas' attack on him, struggles to sit up. He manages to find his phone and loads the picture of Cameron and Chas in bed together and presses 'Send'. Declan and Katie are about to cut the cake, but become involved in argument with Megan. Megan pushes Katie's face into the cake before leaving. Cameron finds Carl and picks up the brick that Chas used on him earlier, he tells Carl that he'll help him if he keeps quiet about the affair and leaves both him and Chas alone. The pair argue and Cameron hits Carl over the head in exactly the same spot that Chas did previously. Zak and Cain realise they've had a breakthrough with each other. Charity leaves Debbie's phone on her bedside table as she sleeps. Cameron is stunned to find Carl is dead and picks up his phone before fleeing the scene. As Debbie sleeps, six new messages come through on her phone.

Herr Gr√∂ttrup‚Äôs breakfast egg takes over the narration and rebels against the orderly household by remaining soft despite being boiled for the regulation seven and a half minutes: and so commences a story hailed for its ‚Äòchangeling‚Äô character, gentle satire and humour. The award was presented by the Mayor of Klagenfurt, Maria Luise Mathiasschitz, who praised Otoo as ‚Äúa new voice for a new society‚Äù. When questioned by The Guardian whether the award represented the jury‚Äôs desire to make a stand against the growing xenophobia and right-wing populism in Europe, Otoo said it might have played a part, ‚Äúbut I think in the end they voted for the quality of the story‚Äù.

He captained the team in 1963 and played in the 1964 Grand Final premiership under captain Neil Kerley, which was the last premiership to be won by South Adelaide. Following his retirement from football, Day moved into the media where he became a highly respected sports presenter and football commentator in Adelaide. In 2017, Ian was inducted into the Adelaide Oval Media Hall of Fame.  Playing career  An accomplished and combative rover, Ian Day gave good service to two league clubs in a 12-season career at the top level. He began at West Adelaide in 1952, and played a total of 67 league matches there (missing the whole of the 1953 season due to a broken leg) before crossing to South Adelaide in 1961. The timing of this move meant that he missed the opportunity later that year to participate in West‚Äôs Grand Final defeat of Norwood, but he made amends three seasons later by helping South to its first flag since 1938. Day formed part of a powerful first ruck combination that day along with Peter Darley and Neil Kerley, and had the satisfaction of kicking the Panthers‚Äô ninth, and final, goal of the match. It was the last of Ian Day‚Äôs 68 SANFL matches for the club. He also kicked a total of 178 goals, 80 with Westies, and 98 for South which included a club list heading tally of 35 in his last season.  Media career  Once his playing career was over, Ian Day became, and continued for many years as, a television football commentator of note. Ian joined Channel 7‚Äôs television commentary team in 1965 as a pioneer of League Football television coverage with Blair Schwartz and Bob Jervis. When Channel 9 secured the broadcast rights, Ian joined as its leading football commentator. Ian finished his commentary career with Channel 2‚Äôs commentary team, retiring in 1994 Ian is quoted as saying ‚ÄúI was extremely lucky in that the year I quit playing football was the year Channel 7 decided to televise the game. They asked me to become a commentator and when I pleaded I‚Äôd never done it before, they told me no-one had. We all learned together.‚Äù As testament to his professionalism his colleagues offer the following: Ian felt for the players and was positive in his comments ‚Äì although this did not stop him from analysing their style and passing relevant comment. Ian was never false in his presentation. Ian‚Äôs tone of voice was genuine when injecting excitement in the call. Ian was renowned for his homework when calling both League and Reserves matches. Ian prided himself on the fact that as a commentator he did not ‚Äúrubbish‚Äù players and did not show personal bias.  Family Connections  Ian Day‚Äôs younger brother Robert Day played with distinction for West Adelaide. In 1971, he moved to Victoria and signed with Hawthorn in the VFL. He was a member of that season's premiership team, playing as a half back flanker in Hawthorn's Grand Final win over St Kilda. He was replaced at half time because he was suffering from concussion. Ian Day's grandson is Sam Day, an Australian rules footballer who plays for the Gold Coast Football Club. He was selected by the Gold Coast with the third pick in the 2010 national draft. Sam made his AFL debut against the Brisbane Lions in round 7 of the 2011 season. He kicked a career high four goals against Collingwood in 2014.

His pioneering work with various Sarajevo-based rock acts, in both creative and organizational capacity, has made him a well known behind-the-scenes figure on the country's music scene.  Early life  Widely known as ƒåiƒçak (burdock) for his curly hair, Altarac attended the First Sarajevo Gymnasium from 1961 until 1965, a period during which he grew increasingly infatuated with Western pop culture, specifically rock music coming from the United States and United Kingdom that had already been gaining a devoted audience among the youth of communist Yugoslavia. Teenage ƒåiƒçak thus often found himself skipping gymnasium classes in pursuit of activities he was more interested in ‚Äì organizing local rock gigs, writing and reciting poetry, moderating music events, and editing the gymnasium newsletter Polet. He developed a particular interest in the crossover between poetry and rock music, reciting his own poetry at different student manifestations over the coming years. Among the more memorable such events from this period was a beatnik-like stage setup where upstart actors Etela Pardo and Branko Liƒçen were reciting ƒåiƒçak's verses while budding musician Ranko Rihtman provided musical cover on keyboards. ƒåiƒçak with Indexi at the very first 'Uz malu pomoƒá mojih prijatelja' rock marathon, held at Sarajevo's Dom mladih in January 1979 In the late sixties in the basement of a student house Mladen Stojanoviƒá, in downtown Sarajevo, the first underground club Barutana was taking shape. Obviously not without ƒåiƒçak participating from the very beginning. It was in Barutana were many, later famous musicians of BiH and former Yugoslavia started their journey in some sort of Bosnian/Yugoslavian \\"tower of songs\\". ƒåiƒçak soon commenced a tailor-made program \\"ƒåiƒçak plus ƒåiƒçak\\" (‚ÄúBurdock Plus Burdock\\") where ≈Ωelimir Altarac ƒåiƒçak and band ƒåiƒçak that already gained reputation of best DJ in former Yugoslavia jointly performed, and where youngsters were getting together in Barutana to listen to the latest music productions from around the world, particularly progressive and avant-garde genres. It was also there that ƒåiƒçak made yet another successful step towards, not only working with the music but rather working on the music of his own. His cooperation with pop-rock group Kodeksi (Codex) resulted in three great hits according to the Sarajevo Radio Chart (the best media platform for progressive music waves of that time). He wrote lyrics for Eduard Bogeljiƒá's song \\"Lutalica\\" (Wandereranduhe also o madr remaske of two great world hits \\"To Love Somebody\\" of Bee Gees and \\"Song of a Baker\\" of Small Faces.  Time of affirmation: DJ, journalist, promoter  His collaboration with famous rock group Indexi helped ≈Ωelimir Altarac ƒåiƒçak to further sharpen his poetic expression in pop rock music. He is the author of the lyrics of one of the most famous Index's songs such are: \\"Negdje na kraju u zati≈°ju\\" (‚ÄúSomewhere, at the end of a road, where everything goes down to silence‚Äù),\\"Svijet u kome ≈æivim\\" (The World I live In). A truth seeking of \\"Negdje na kraju u zati≈°ju\\" was firstly published in the aforementioned Polet just to be later musically arranged and almost perfectly tuned by famous Yugoslavian guitarist and member of Indexi Slobodan Bodo Kovaƒçeviƒá, who actually made a 12-minute-long song which starts and ends with recitation. It was a somewhat unusual and new form of musical expression at the time, but was very successful according to the Radio Sarajevo Music Chart. ≈Ωelimir Altarac ƒåiƒçak also later wrote \\"Povratak Jacka Trbosjeka\\" (Return of Jack the Ripper) as one the hits of historical maxi single of Indexi published in 1972., although the song \\"The World I live In\\" is still holding the record as the most played song on Indexi concerts ever and furthermore as the most played and rearranged song by the other groups including Te≈°ka Industrija, Konvoj, rock legend Branimir ≈†tuliƒá, Gruhak, \\"Krug\\" (The Circle), The Evolution, Texas Flood .... ƒåiƒçak circa mid-1980s, taping an episode of ≈†arada akustika ‚Äî his weekly 250px Besides his experiences with Barutana and collaboration with Indexi, follows Yugoslav tours entitled Top Rock disco show, and he was a winner of European competition of DJ's in Istrian city of Rovinj. ƒåiƒçak has always shown a great interest in working as a music radio host. His journey to achieving this started in 1974, at the Radio Sarajevo where he was initially hosting Pop Orion and then consequently in later years radio shows such as Attention please, mind the Dynamite on the Vinyl, Balads in the shadow of skyscrapers and, Joyful Electronics. When the Radio Sarajevo started its late night programme in 1981, ƒåiƒçak was among the significant few to immediately jump in. He helped Radio Sarajevo with his moving borders spirit, but he was also helped by the Radio Sarajevo to make his name in the music realm of Former Yugoslavia. His late night program started with a show called Discoth√®que at half past two, which was certainly just an introduction into one of the most famous radio shows in former Yugoslavia Charade of acoustic which thousands of people from Slovenia down to the Mazedonia tuned in to in the prime time between 4.30 p.m. -6.00 p.m. He soon started yet another adventure by traveling to different places within former Yugoslavia with his \\"flying\\" discoth√®que called Top Rock Disco Show. Very positive perception of music critics and thousands of listeners encouraged ƒåiƒçak to undertake yet another endeavor ‚Äì discovering and promotion of new rising stars. From 1977. to 1982. at Sloga cultural club, downtown Sarajevo, ≈Ωelimir Altarac ƒåiƒçak was paving the way for a new generation of rock musicians to show their talent. Talented young musicians and rock groups to be, from those garage bands to the school ones, were dreaming of having an opportunity to present themselves at Sloga. Those who were proven to be the best did really get the opportunity ‚Äì ≈Ωaoka (Sting), Flota (Fleet), Top (Canon), Kako had, Mali print (Small Prince), Rock Apoteka (Rock Pharmacy), Tina, Ozbiljno Pitanje (A Serious Question), Linija ≈æivota (Life Line), Posljednji autobus (The Last Bus), Lucifer, Velika Porodica (The Big Family)... This healthy competition of its own had helped forging new domestic pop rock concepts and shaped up later to be among the biggest pop-rock bands in the former Yugoslavia ‚Äì Zabranjeno Pu≈°enje, Plavi orkestar, Crvena jabuka, Bombaj ≈†tampa, Valentino, Gino Banana, and singer Mladen Vojiƒçiƒá Tifa...They had also opened the door of fame to somewhat at the time smaller bands who just later gained their momentum of fame- Vatreni Poljubac, Divlje jagode, Film (band), Buldo≈æer, Galija... ƒåiƒçak onstage at Sloga club in Sarajevo in 1978 As one might expect, ƒåiƒçak was not lulled by success and fame, but instead continued to spread new narratives and discover new territories. At ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá Workers' University Amphitheatre, from 1977. to 1980., he was organizing lectures about the world and domestic trends in pop rock music. As journalist and music critic, ≈Ωelimir Altarac ƒåiƒçak was publishing articles and editorials in almost all leading newspapers and magazines in Sarajevo and former Yugoslavia ‚Äì VEN, Veƒçernje novine, Svijet, Osloboƒëenje, D≈æuboks, and Rock.

It was dramatized based on the incident 'Revenge of Soga Brothers'. The story is often known as The (illustrated) Tale of the Soga Brothers or The revenge of the Soga brothers. It is sometimes written as Soga Monogatari Zue (The Tale of the Soga brothers in pictures). It is regarded by some as the last of the Gunki monogatari or great \\"war tales\\". The brothers are Soga J≈´r≈ç and Soga Gor≈ç. J≈´r≈ç being the older of the two. When the boys were younger they were known as Ichimanmaru and Hakoomaru. In Japanese the Soga brothers are described as Soga kyodai. Their names are also written as Soga no Gor≈ç and Soga no J≈´r≈ç. The name Soga is the name of their stepfather, which became their surname after their mother remarried. The name of their biological father was Kawazu-Sabur≈ç. Authorship The Tale of the Soga Brothers origin cannot be traced to a single creator. Like most of these historical stories, it is the result of the compounding of (often differing) versions passed down through an oral or other tradition. The origin of the story may be true, but the story is probably romanticised. In some versions of the story it is only revealed at the end that the main character is actually one of the brothers. Theme The Tale of the Soga Brothers is an example of \\"blood revenge\\", similar to a vendetta. Plot Events take place in Japan in the 12th century. The general accepted version is that the father of the two boys was killed (the reasons differ, but it was probably an argument over land rights) when they were infants. As adults they became skilled fighters intent on avenging their father and retrieving his sword Tomokirimaru. The villain is usually Kud≈ç Suketsune, a retainer of the sh≈çgun (probably Minamoto no Yoritomo). J≈´r≈ç is killed in the fighting as is Kud≈ç Suketsune. Gor≈ç dies later (by execution). In popular culture The story has been the subject of many Noh, kabuki and bunraku performances. There are also updated versions such as Sukeroku (The Flower of Edo) (an 18th century kabuki play, which is regarded as one of the Kabuki J≈´hachiban). It is also said that the Soga tales in K≈çwakamai are based on this tale. The story and its performers have been popular subjects for woodblock prints,The Tale of the Soga brothers by And≈ç Hiroshige netsukeAn example sold by Christie's in Amsterdam in 2008 and okimono. The story has also been the subject of a number of films.An example of a 1915 film on the IMDb websiteAn example of a 1920 film on the IMDb website Notes In Japan there are many statues of the brothers (such as the famous statue in the Hachiman Jinja in Kawazu, Shizuoka). According to tradition they were buried at the foot of Mount Fuji, there is a sculpture of their tombs among the stone statues in Hakone.The Stone Statues on the Hakone Tourism Website Otodome Falls is one of the locations in a version of the tale from the Kamakura period. There is no relation with the Soga clan. Translations The story was translated by Thomas J.

Unable to run for a new term, Gioja proposed U√±ac as the new governor, in light of the good results of his brief tenure as interim governor. He was elected governor in the 2015 elections. His victory was well received by the mining and wine production sectors of the province.

She took part in the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War, serving in The Channel, the Mediterranean and the West Indies. Roebuck fought in the attack on Martinique in January 1759 and the capture of Guadeloupe in April. Construction and armament Roebuck was one of the 1741 Establishment group of Royal Navy fifth-rates. Originally ordered 1 December 1742 as a 40-gun ship, she was completed with 44 guns; 20 x 18pdrs on her lower deck, 20 x 9pdrs on her upper deck and 4 x 6pdrs on the quarter deck. Her keel, long, was laid down on 2 January 1743. As built, Roebuck was long at the gundeck, had a beam of , and a depth in the hold of , making her 708 tons burthen.Winfield p. 170 Service Having cost the Admiralty ¬£7,266.5.0d, Roebuck was launched on 21 December 1743. She was first commissioned under Captain Thomas Sturton and taken to Portsmouth, where she was finished at a further cost of ¬£4,251.18.5d. Upon finishing, Roebuck joined the Channel Fleet under Admiral John Norris. Norris' fleet had left The Downs early on 24 February 1744, having received word that 15 French ships out of Brest were off Dungeness.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.IV) p.117 Contrary wind and tide forced the British to anchor within sight of their enemy, where at 11:00 they were joined by Roebuck from Portsmouth. The Naval Chronicle (Vol.IV) p.118 At about 01:00 the following morning, a storm blew up which continued for much of the day, breaking cables and scattering the fleet. Roebuck remained at anchor but lost one of her boats. The storm broke that evening but the French, by that time, had already gone.Richmond p. 83 Although France and Great Britain were technically at peace, a declaration of war was expected at any time and the possibility of invasion from a large fleet of French transports at Dunkirk kept Norris from pursuing.Richmond p. 91 Norris wanted to retain enough ships to attack the French at Dunkirk should an opportunity present itself but ships were also needed to escort 6,000 Dutch troops from Willemstadt. In addition Admiral Thomas Mathews' fleet in the Mediterranean was desperately short of supplies and the victualing fleet at Spithead was unable to move while the French were still at large.Richmond p. 86 Norris, required to divide his forces but wanting to prevent the Channel Fleet from becoming too depleted, decided that eight of his most powerful vessels would chaperone Mathews' supplies only as far as Brest. Two fifth-rates would then take the convoy the rest of the way. This order was later changed and Roebuck and Preston took the transports only as far as the Tagus, with Mathews left to arrange the remainder of the journey.Richmond p. 97 The convoy was due to sail on 25 March, the same day war broke out, but foul weather delayed departure until 31 March. Progress was slow due to the lack of wind and in due course the fleet was forced to anchor once more. When the wind returned, it was blowing the wrong way. Finally, on 23 April 1744, Roebuck, with , Duke, , St George, Princess Royal, , , Princess Amelia and another fifth-rate, Preston, escorted the convoy up the Channel.Richmond p. 86 While separated from the convoy, Roebuck fell in with and captured an 18-gun Spanish vessel, 150 nautical miles west of Cape Finisterre. She arrived in Lisbon with her prize on 6 May to find the convoy already there, having arrived three days previous.Charnock p. 261Kingsley p. 341 It was subsequently blockaded by the Brest fleet and had to be rescued on 9 September, by a force of 25 British and Dutch ships under Sir John Balchen.Newberry pp. 30‚Äì31 =Mediterranean service= Roebuck subsequently joined Admiral William Rowley's fleet in the Mediterranean, where on 20 October 1744, she was despatched with Stirling Castle, Guernsey and Chatham to watch the Spanish in Cadiz while the rest of Rowley's ships escorted a large flotilla of merchant vessels.Richmond p. 236 In September 1745 she was attached to a small squadron comprising Liverpool, Seaford, Kennington, Feversham, two bomb ketches and two other smaller vessels, with orders to watch Toulon, patrol the coast of Genoa and prevent supplies being transferred between Naples and the Adriatic or along the coast of Italy.Richmond p. 243 Roebuck spent some time at anchor in the port of Leghorn while the powerful ships-of-the-line bombarded the city of Genoa; leaving on 12 October to rejoin the main fleet. In December 1746, Roebuck, then under the command of Captain John Weller, delivered cannon to the army of Maximilian Ulysses Browne while it lay siege to Antibes. Roebuck remained as part of the blockading fleet under Vice Admiral Henry Medley.Beatson (Vol.I) p. 354 On 1 February the Austrians withdrew, fearing an attack from a large force under the Duc de Belle-Isle. Browne also thought the siege ineffective, suggesting the town was being resupplied whenever foul weather blew the blockading ships off station. No longer required, Medley's fleet was reassigned to keeping the Spanish fleet bottled up in Cartegena while Roebuck and some smaller craft were left to protect the islands of Sainte Marguerite and Saint Honorat, occupied at that time by Britain's Austrian allies. On 18 February several small craft were seen on the Cannes shore and Wellard sent in a barca-longa and two feluccas to destroy them. French troops gathered on the beach to protect their boats but the British managed to capture six and destroy many others without losing a man. Four days later, another large force assembled on the shore, this time with artillery, which it was supposed was for an assault on the castle on Sainte Marguerite. Wellard ordered another attack, which came under heavy fire when the cannon on the beach were turned against his modest squadron.Ekshaw p. 170 Roebuck however soon put the batteries out of action and forced the enemy to retreat. The barca-longa had to retire, being in danger of sinking but Roebuck kept up her bombardment until it was too dark to continue. In the process, she received some thirty shot to her hull and much damage to her spars and rigging; six of her crew were killed and 14 wounded.Beatson (Vol.I) p. 355 To prevent further attempts, Captain George Townsend, at that time commanding a squadron off Provence, was ordered to extend his patrol to include the islands. When the war ended in October 1748, Roebuck was paid off. She returned to England, where she was surveyed in November. Repairs started in April 1750 at Deptford which took five years and cost the Admiralty ¬£3,128.19.9d. By the time the ship had been refitted at Woolwich, the costs had risen to ¬£8,189.5.2d. Roebuck was brought back into service in July 1755 under Captain Matthew Whitwell.Winfield p. 171 =The Leeward Station= In December 1756, Roebuck was on the Jamaica Station, under the command of Captain John Hollwall, who later took her to the Leeward Islands. Hollwell was superseded by Captain Thomas Lynn, who returned the ship to Jamaica in December 1757. Roebuck was present for the attack on Martinique in January 1759.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.III) pp.437‚Äì438 To facilitate attacks on French possessions in the Caribbean, the Leeward Squadron was joined by eight ships- of-the-line and transports containing 4,400 troops under the command of Peregrine Hopson. The reinforcements arrived in Barbados from England in January 1759.Clowes pp. 201 ‚Äì 202 Sir John Moore retained command of naval operations and the force set sail on 13 January, arriving two days later in Fort-Royal Bay.Clowes p. 201 At 08:00 on 16 January 1759, Roebuck with and , opened fire on the batteries in Cas des Navieres Bay, where it was intended to land the troops. At the same time, and attacked Fort Negro, three miles away.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.III) p.439Beaston (Vol.II) p.313 The battery at Cas des Navieres was silenced when the magazine exploded, but Roebuck and the others continued to fire at the shore so the enemy was unable to form up and oppose a landing. The squadron kept up its salvo for much of the following day and provided covering fire when the troops landed at 16:00.Beaston (Vol.II) p. 314 Without access to drinking water, and out-numbered by 10,000 French troops and militia, the British were later forced to withdraw and, after a short bombardment of Saint-Pierre, it was decided to abandon the invasion altogether and instead attack Guadeloupe.Clowes p. 202McLynn p. 110 Plan of the attack on Basse-Terre on 23 January 1759, shows Roebuck attacking batteries to the west of the town Point √† Pitre in Guadeloupe by a squadron, detached from Commodore Moore and commanded by Capt. Wm. Harman of on 14 February 1759. Showing Roebuck The British force arrived off Basse-Terre at midday on 22 January and began their attack the following morning. Moore took eight of his largest ships, of between 60 and 90 guns, in to cannonade the enemy batteries and citadel. When the 60-gun Rippon grounded, Roebuck and Bristol were required to sail in and rescue her. By 17:00 the French guns had been put out of action. At 22:00, four bomb ketches began to shell the town. The bombardment continued throughout the night, causing a fire which swept through town destroying buildings and gutting the citadel.Clowes p. 203 On 24 January, troops were landed which quickly occupied Basse-Terre but were unable to capture the governor, who escaped into the mountains. Instead of pursuing however, Hopson decided to consolidate his position and by 30 January, 1,500 of his men had succumbed to disease. On 13 February, Moore sent Roebuck with Berwick, Woolwich, Renown and two bomb ketches to attack Fort Louis on the Grande Terre side of the island.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.III) p.446 On 11 March, Moore received news of a French squadron comprising eight ships-of-the- line and three large frigates. While Roebuck was left to guard the transports, Moore gathered his ships and set sail for Prince Rupert's Bay, Dominica where he was able to resupply and was best placed to monitor the enemy's movements.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.III) pp.446‚Äì447 After three months of sporadic fighting, on 22 April, the Governor of Guadeloupe eventually offered to surrender. It was accepted by John Barrington, Hopson having died from a tropical illness at the end of February, and terms were agreed on 25 April.The Naval Chronicle (Vol.III) pp. 446 ‚Äì 448 Non-naval service and fate Roebuck paid off for the last time in August 1759. She was hired out as a foreign, private warship from June 1762 until January 1764. On her return, she was surveyed then sold at Portsmouth for ¬£560.0.0d on 3 July.

He then worked with the Royal Navy to devise a system, known as an anti-submarine indicator loop, for detecting submarines by detecting currents induced in a loop of wire on the sea floor. Early life Mitchell was born in Leith on 1 July 1864 to James Mitchell and Isabella Mitchell n√©e Crichton. He studied physics at Edinburgh University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1889. His proposers were Peter Guthrie Tait, Alexander Crum Brown, George Chrystal, and Sir Thomas Clark. He was elected a Fellow of the Scottish Meteorological Society in 1891. India In 1890, he went to Trivandrum, in India, where he taught physics at the Maharaja's College. He also took up the position of director of the Trivandrum Observatory which had been established by John Caldecott and later headed by John Allan Broun before it fell into disuse. He married Agnes Farquharson Robertson (d. 1948) on 2 May 1892 and the couple had three children, all of whom were born in Trivandrum. By 1893 he became a Principal of the college and also served as Director of Public instruction in the State of Travancore. The work involved inspecting schools across the region which he did on motorcycle. He once had an accident in Mavelikkara at a place later called as Mitchell Junction. Resigning from the college in 1912, he returned to Scotland and became a Honorary Research Fellow at Edinburgh University. Later work During the First World War, German U-Boats were operational and a strategy was proposed to destroy the British Empire by blocking key ports such as the Firth of Forth. The Royal Society of Edinburgh set up a War Committee that discussed how science could be applied to defence. Mitchell visited the West Pier at Leith in June 1915 and on 1 August he tried a loop of wire at the end of Leith Pier and found that it could detect a passing trawler through the induced current. He later placed the loop horizontally on the harbour floor and found that it was too sensitive but could detect all passing ships. He solved the sensitivity problem by placing the loop in a figure of eight pattern. In 1916, he became the superintendent of the Eskdalemuir Observatory. In 1922 he headed the Edinburgh office of the meteorological department which was created after the dissolution of the Scottish Meteorological Society. From 1916 to 1926 he was Curator of the library for the Royal Society of Edinburgh and from 1926 to 1929 served as the Society's Vice President under Sir Alfred Ewing as President. He received honorary doctorates from both the University of Edinburgh and Geneva. In the 1920s he served on the Committee for the Air Council. He made important studies into magnetic studies at Eskdalemuir Observatory in 1927. A major publication of Mitchell's was a review and history of the study of terrestrial magnetism published in three parts. His work earned him the Keith Prize for 1931‚Äì33. He died in Edinburgh on 15 April 1952.

Early life Like several of the younger fedayeen involved in the Munich operation, Hamid had grown up in the Chatila refugee camp in Lebanon as a youngster. He joined Fatah in 1968 and like his fellow fedayeen had a familiarity with Germany, living and studying there for over a year, before returning to Lebanon in 1971. Preparation for the Attack at the Munich Olympics Such was the secrecy behind the operation that Hamid like the other fedayeen told his family that he was returning to Germany for different reasons. In Hamid's case he told his Mother that he was going back to Germany to study, telling her he would be there for two and a half months or so. Death at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base Upon arriving in one of the two helicopters with his fellow fedayeen and the Israeli athletes at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, the fedayeen became embroiled in a firefight with five German police marksmen positioned around the airfield who fired upon the fedayeen.

They were led by first-year head coach Tim Lester and played their home games at Waldo Stadium as a member of the West Division of the Mid-American Conference. The Broncos finished the season 6‚Äì6, 4‚Äì4 to finish in fourth place in the West Division. Despite being bowl eligible, the Broncos did not receive an invite to a bowl game. The team set the FBS record for most combined points scored in a game (139) and tied the record for most overtime periods (seven) in their 71‚Äì68 victory over Buffalo. Previous season The Broncos finished the 2016 season 13‚Äì1, 8‚Äì0 in MAC play to win the MAC West Division. They defeated Ohio 29‚Äì23 in the MAC Championship Game, winning the school's first MAC title since 1988. WMU received an invitation to the 2017 Cotton Bowl as the highest rated Group of Five team in the College Football Playoff (CFP) where they lost to No. 8-ranked Wisconsin. Following the season, head coach P. J. Fleck left the school to take the head coaching position at Minnesota. On January 13, 2017, the school hired Tim Lester as head coach. Preseason Western Michigan was picked to finish second in the MAC West Division by members of the league's media. They received one vote to win the 2017 MAC Championship Game. Schedule  The following table lists WMU's schedule.http://www.wmubroncos.com/schedule.aspx?path=football Season =Summary= USC WMU opened the season with a 49‚Äì31 loss to No. 4 USC. Despite losing by 18 points, USC struggled to stop WMU's running game as the Broncos led the Trojans in team rushing yards 263‚Äì232 and led time of possession 34:40‚Äì25:20. WMU also led the game 21‚Äì14 with 9:11 left in the third quarter and the game was tied at 28 with 7:54 left. Redshirt freshman Jon Wassink started the game at quarterback for WMU and caught a touchdown pass and also rushed for a touchdown. Senior cornerback and kick returner Darius Phillips intercepted a pass and returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. Michigan State The Broncos traveled to face Michigan State in East Lansing on September 9. The WMU offense struggled throughout as the MSU defense held the Broncos to 195 yard on offense. The only bright spot for the Broncos was Phillips who forced a fumble and returned it 67 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter to cut the Spartans lead to 14‚Äì7. After the Spartans moved the lead to 28‚Äì7 on an LJ Scott two-yard touchdown run, Phillips answered again, returning the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for the Broncos second touchdown of the game. MSU's defense took over from there, halting the last WMU drive on fourth down at the Spartan 15 yard line. Idaho The Broncos welcomed the Vandals to Waldo Stadium on September 16 for the team's first home game. The Broncos trailed 14‚Äì6 at the half and 28‚Äì19 as the third quarter ended as they looked like they were headed for their third consecutive defeat to open the season. However, John Wassink ran for two scores in the fourth quarter and the Broncos added a field goal to pull out the win 37‚Äì28. Wagner WMU finished the non-conference portion of their schedule against Wagner at Waldo Stadium. Quarterback Jon Wassink threw a career-high three touchdown passes as the Broncos blew out the Eagles 49‚Äì14. WMU racked up 527 total yards while limiting Wagner to 113 yards. The win moved WMU to 2‚Äì2 on the season.  Ball State  The Broncos began the MAC season with a bang, blowing out Ball State 55‚Äì3. Wassink again threw three touchdown passes as the Broncos Obbie Jackson recovered a fumble on the opening kickoff and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown to get the Broncos started. The Broncos out-gained the Cardinals 414‚Äì238 as they forced two Ball State turnovers. The win moved the Broncos to 3‚Äì2 on the season. Buffalo The Broncos defeated Buffalo 71‚Äì68 in seven overtimes in a game that broke the record for most points in an NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) game and tied the record for most overtime (OT) periods in a single game. The 139 points beat the previous record of 137 points scored by Pittsburgh and Syracuse in 2016. WMU had a 10 point lead early in the fourth quarter before Buffalo scored touchdowns on consecutive drives to take a 4 point lead. WMU regained the lead with 4:45 to go in regulation with a touchdown to tight end Donnie Ernsberger. Buffalo tied the game with a 34 yard field goal with 34 seconds left. WMU had a chance to win the game with a 52 yard field goal, but it was blocked and the game entered OT 31‚Äì31. In OT, each team had opportunities to win the game. In the third OT, Buffalo turned the ball over with a fumble, but WMU missed a 29 yard field goal that would have won the game. In the fifth OT, WMU scored a touchdown but failed on the two- point conversion. Buffalo also scored a touchdown and failed on the two-point conversion that would have won the game. In the seventh and final OT, Buffalo had to settled for a field goal and WMU won the game with a Jarvion Franklin 12 yard touchdown run. Akron In a game that was postponed a day due to heavy flooding in Waldo Stadium, WMU lost to Akron 14‚Äì13. The Broncos trailed 14‚Äì3 at halftime and could only score 10 points in the 4th quarter. WMU had the ball with 45 seconds left in the game and drove to the Akron 39 yard line, but could not attempt a 56-yard field goal before time expired. Franklin led the Broncos with 130 yards rushing on 31 carries. WMU outgained Akron 426 total yards to 215. After the game was postponed, 1 to 1.4 million gallons of water were removed from the field overnight. The game was originally scheduled to be broadcast on the CBS Sports Network (CBSSN), but due to the postponement, was not televised. This was the first MAC game to be played on a Sunday since 2006.  Eastern Michigan  The following week, the Broncos traveled to face rival Eastern Michigan. After taking a 10‚Äì7 lead at halftime, Jarvion Franklin's seven-yard rush gave the Broncos a 17‚Äì10 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, the Eagles tied it up early in the fourth quarter and moved in to field goal range as the clock was running out. A 37-yard field goal attempt was no good as time expired to send the game in to overtime. In overtime, WMU was forced to settle for a field goal and the Bronco defense prevented the Eagles from scoring a touchdown. The Eagles missed another field goal, this one from 24 yards out, to give the Broncos the 20‚Äì17 win. Franklin rushed for 104 yards and a touchdown in the game as the Broncos moved to 5‚Äì3 on the season.  Central Michigan  The Broncos jumped out early to a 14‚Äì0 lead against rival Central Michigan. They took a 21‚Äì7 lead at the half on the strength of three rushing touchdowns. Jarvion Franklin's second touchdown of the game gave the WMU a 28‚Äì14 lead with just over eight minutes remaining in the third quarter. However, the Chippewas roared back, scoring touchdowns on three of their next four possessions to pull out the 35‚Äì28 win and earn the Cannon Trophy. The loss dropped WMU to 5‚Äì4 on the season.  Kent State  As Western Michigan returned home to take on Kent State, the Bronco defense took control of the game. Scoring three touchdowns on two interception returns and one fumble return, the Bronco defense helped give WMU the easy 48‚Äì20 win. Jarvion Franklin rushed for 191 yards including a 72-yard touchdown run to give the Broncos the lead for good as the first quarter ended. In addition to scoring three touchdowns, the Bronco defense limited the Golden Flashes to 281 yards in the game. The win moved the Broncos to 6‚Äì4 on the season and made them bowl eligible.  Northern Illinois  On a windy Wednesday night game, the Broncos traveled to DeKalb, Illinois to face Northern Illinois. Jarvion Franklin rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown in the game, but the Broncos still trailed 21‚Äì14 at the half. WMU took the lead in the third on a Reece Goddard touchdown run and pass to give the Broncos a 28‚Äì21 lead going into the fourth quarter. However, NIU scored twice in the fourth quarter and the Broncos could only manage a field goal as WMU fell 35‚Äì31. The loss dropped the Broncos to 6‚Äì5 on the season and ended any chance to win the MAC East Division.  Toledo  In the final regular season game, the Broncos traveled to Toledo as the Rockets looked to clinch a trip to the MAC Championship. The Rockets manhandled the Broncos, taking a 24‚Äì3 lead early in the third quarter. A Tyron Arnett 26-yard touchdown pass from Reece Goddard narrowed the lead to 24‚Äì10 with four minutes left in the third, but the Broncos could not score again as Toledo clinched the MAC West division with a 37‚Äì10 win. The loss dropped the Broncos to 6‚Äì6 on the season. =Conference Players of the Week= Jarvion Franklin Franklin, a senior running back, was named MAC West Offensive Player of the Week for Week 6. Franklin had 37 carries for 176 yards and four touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving) in WMU's 71‚Äì68, seven overtime victory over Buffalo. Franklin had just 4 yards rushing in the first half, 70 yards in the second half, and 102 yards in the overtime periods. He scored three touchdowns in the overtimes. He also had one reception for 20 yards and a touchdown in the game. Darius Phillips Phillips was named the MAC Special Teams Player of the Week for the first two weeks of the season.

Starting in the 19th century missionaries tried to persuade them to abandon their traditional beliefs and practices, with some level of success. The government made efforts to convert them to a \\"colony\\" system in exchange for health, education and economic benefits starting in the 1980s. They are now relatively autonomous within several indigenous territories. Languages The Tariana language belongs to the Arawakan linguistic family. The Tariana language, closely related to the Baniwa language, is only spoken by individuals from sibs of low rank. The reason given by the Tariana is that once they settled along the Uaup√©s the men of most families married Wanano and Tucano women, and their children grew up speaking their mothers' tongues. Almost all Tariana can speak Tucano, the lingua franca of the Uaup√©s. In 1996 there were no speakers of the Tariana language in Colombia and just 100 in Brazil. Location As of 2010 DAI/AMTB reported a population of 1,914 in Brazil and 205 in Colombia. As of 2014 Siasi/Sesai reported that there were 2,684 Tariana in Amazonas. Indigenous territories in Brazil with Tariana populations include the Alto Rio Negro, M√©dio Rio Negro I, M√©dio Rio Negro II, Balaio and Cu√©-Cu√©/Marabitanas. In Colombia there are Tariana people on the Vaup√©s River and the lower Papur√≠ River. The largest numbers of Tariana live along the middle and upper reaches of the Uaup√©s River. The largest concentration is that of the communities in and around the village of Iauaret√™, with an estimated population of about 1,300 Tariana in 2004. These include the old neighborhoods of S√£o Miguel, Don Bosco, Santa Maria and S√£o Pedro in the village, Campo Alto below Iauaret√™ on the Uaup√©s, Itaia√ßu and Miriti above Iauaret√™ on the Uaup√©s, and Japur√°, Aracap√° and Sabi√° on the right bank of the Papur√≠ River near its mouth. There are communities of Tucano, Arapaso and Pira-Tapuia between this main Tariana concentration and two other concentrations, that of Santa Rosa and Periquito further upstream on the Uaup√©s, and that of Ipanor√©, Urubuquara, Piu-Pinu and Nova Esperan√ßa further downstream. There are also unknown numbers of Tariana living in other communities or urban centers of the Rio Negro such as the towns of S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira, Santa Isabel and Barcelos. Traditions The Tariana are traditionally patrilineal, exogamous and patrilocal. That is, lineage is traced in the line of the father, they marry women from different ethnic groups, and the wife comes to live in the husband's community. Women of the Tariana may marry men of the Tucano or Piratapuyo groups. There is an inherited status in the social hierarchy, including leaders, specialists in dances and ornaments, shamans and serfs. The ethnic groups of the Uaup√©s River accept the Tariana's view of themselves as \\"bip√≥ diro√° mas√≠\\" (children of the blood of the thunder). Tariana tradition says they originated around the Uapu√≠ waterfall on the upper Aiari River, a tributary of the I√ßana River from which the upper Uaup√©s can be reached by land. The mythology describes various places where they halted, and where the hierarchy was established between the ancestors of the different sibs of the exogamic \\"Tariana ethnicity\\". Shards of Tariana ceramics found in Jurupari date back 600 years. History =Early European contacts= Franciscan missionaries on the Uaup√©s River found large numbers of Tariana in the town of Ipanor√©. The upper Rio Negro region was devastated by smallpox in 1740 and then by measles in 1749 and 1763. The Indians of the region were exploited by the regat√µes (traders), who forced them to work without pay. In the mid-19th century the governor of the newly formed Province of Amazonas initiated a program of \\"civilization and catechization\\" of the Indians in the upper Rio Negro valley. A Capuchin baptized 700 Indians and built chapels in 24 villages on the Uaup√©s and I√ßana rivers. Helped by five Tucano and Tariana chiefs the Capuchins established ten settlements on the riverside, and used force and the promise of tools to induce the Indians to move to them and work for the government. Some were taken to work in Manaus, and children were placed in orphanages. In 1857 a military force attacked several Tariana villages. Prophetic movements in the second half of the 19th century promised to liquidate the debts of the people and absolve their sins. Three Franciscan missionaries were expelled by the Tariana in 1883 after they exhibited a mask of Jurupari on the church pulpit, which women were not allowed to see since it was used in male initiation rites. =Salesian missions= Portrait of an indigenous chief of the Uaup√©s River by D√©cio Villares () In the first decades of the 20th century Salesian missions were established on the Uaup√©s, and the missionaries became the local representatives of the state. They were given ample funds to convert and \\"civilize\\" the indigenous people, and were able to reduce abuses by the Brazilian and Colombian traders on the river. When Curt Nimuendaj√∫ visited the river in 1927 he found that Iauaret√™ was already the main center of Tariana people, with 479 inhabitants of a stretch of the river. He noted that the missionaries were intolerant of the traditional Tariana culture. There was a nearby Colombian customs post at the confluence of the Papuri and Uaup√©s rivers, which led to abuse by Colombian traders in the absence of Brazilian authority. At Nimuendaj√∫'s recommendation an SPI (Servi√ßo de Prote√ß√£o aos √çndios: Indian Protection Service) station was established on the right (west) bank of the Uaup√©s opposite the Salesian mission on the left (east) bank below the point where the Papuri enters the Uaup√©s. The first mission boarding school was established in May 1930, starting with three resident missionaries and 15 students. Work began on construction of housing for boys and girls, the church, hospital, lodgings, a sawmill and a pottery, using local labor. By the end of the 1930s there was a much larger staff of missionaries and lodgings for 250 indigenous students. There were plantations and ranches, but the schools largely depended on contributions by parents of about of flour per pupil per year. By 1950 there were 40 staff in the mission, most of them alumni of the boarding schools, the largest Salesians establishment in the Rio Negro region. The missionaries demanded that to receive sacrament and participate in trade the Indians give up their ceremonial objects and move from their traditional malocas into individual houses grouped around a chapel. This gradually happened. Some mission students left for Colombia to work in the rubber plantations of that country, using their education to negotiate terms of labor. The SPI post seems to have closed in 1932, reopened in 1943 with a telegraph station, and closed again in 1952. There was constant tension between the SPI agents and the missionaries, who accused the SPI of encouraging \\"immoral\\" traditional practices. For nine years a large number of Indians were organized by the Salesians to build an airstrip, which opened in 1958. From now on the Brazilian Air Force supported the mission. =Economic changes= After the end of the 1960s the Colombian rubber plantations closed down, and the Indians no longer found work there. Starting from the early 1970s the town of S√£o Gabriel da Cachoeira, two weeks by canoe downriver, began to expand due to investments under the National Integration Plan (PIN). Some of the Tariana drifted there to find work in construction, or in building the new road linking the town to the military post of Cucu√≠ on the Venezuelan border, which was abandoned a few years later. In Iauaret√™ the Salesians continued to control the economy, but the educational system evolved away from a boarding school model with emphasis on crafts such as carpentry and tailoring to a day school model with the standard Brazilian curriculum. The boarding schools finally closed in 1988. In 1976 Funrural opened a branch in Iauaret√™ and began paying rural pensions to people over 65. The old SPI post was reopened by the Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio (National Indian Foundation, FUNAI), implementing the \\"Alto Rio Negro Plan\\" to improve health and agriculture and to give the Indians economic alternatives to the mission enterprises. The first indigenous cooperative was established in 1978, and although it failed there was steady growth in independent commercial activity. New residents began to move to Iauaret√™, often kin of the Tariana. During the 1980s some of the men became involved in mining, or in carrying goods for sale to miners, or in working for Colombian drug traffickers, but this work proved short-lived. =Colony versus Indigenous Territory= With the growth of the populations of the Papuri and Upper Uaup√©s rivers on the border between Brazil and Colombia, the region began to be seen as important in terms of national security. The First Special Border Squadron (1st PEF) was installed in Iauaret√™ in 1988‚Äì89. About the same time, the first indigenous organizations become established, demanding greater autonomy. Moves were made to colonize the northern Amazon border under the Military Security Council's Calha Norte Project, and discussion began about creation of an \\"Indigenous Colony\\" in Iauaret√™. Despite reservations by indigenous leaders about the Calha Norte Project in the upper Rio Negro region a mosaic of \\"Indigenous Colonies\\" and \\"National Forests\\" was officially created in 1987‚Äì88. The territories reserved for the Indians were reduced and other territorial units were created where natural and mineral resources could be exploited. The missionaries, long in favor of \\"civilizing\\" the Indians, now began to shift to support for indigenous rights in opposing the Calha Norte Project. At a meeting in Taracu√° in June 1988 the Uaup√©s and Tiqui√© Indians were told that if they agreed they were \\"acculturated\\" their territory would become a colony and they would receive health, education and economic benefits. The Tariana of Iauaret√™ had accepted this argument, but Tariana communities downstream were concerned that in a colony they would be exploited by the miners and loggers who would enter the region. After a set of ordinances created indigenous colonies and national forests in the region the supporters of the colony model became demoralized because the promised benefits were not delivered. New indigenous organizations in favor of more autonomy were formed. The dispute between the different groups was resolved in the mid-1990s when the federal government recognized over of Indigenous Territories in the region.

Life A view from Seacliff Harbour to Tantallon Castle The grave of John Watson Laidlay, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh He was born on 27 March 1808 in Glasgow, the son of John Laidlay Esq. Of Fleetwood in Lancashire. His father was a businessman who travelled extensively. His mother was sister to the bankers and merchants J & R Watson and it is likely that John Laidlay worked for the firm. Watsons owned extensive indigo plantations in Bengal. He was educated at a private school in Blackheath, London. He then studied Chemistry under Michael Faraday. He also studied Hindustani under Dr Gilchrist in London and there was introduced to Bishop Reginald Heber. Having been suitably trained he was sent to India in 1825 to represent his uncles in their Indian companies. This also linked to other company interests in the East India Company. The two had silk and indigo factories in Behrampore, Rampore- Beauleah, Surdah etc. J W Laidlay oversaw these factories until 1841.Cambridge Journals: Obituaries April 1885 In 1839 he took an extended trip to the Straits Settlements in Malaysia for health reasons. Here he befriended Sir James Brooke. In 1841 he moved to Moorshedabad in north-east Bengal. Here he became more settled. In 1844 he married Ellen Johnstone Hope, daughter of William Hope of Duddingston in Edinburgh. Together they went to live in Calcutta. He had a great love of ancient languages and coins, specialising in India and the Middle East. He published articles in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society. He left India in 1849 and returned to Britain, living mainly in London. In 1854 he moved northwards to Scotland and settled at Seacliff House, a large property near North Berwick, east of Tantallon Castle with an impressive private harbour. Here he devoted himself to scientific study and private explorations and investigations. In these investigations he discovered a prehistoric cave near his house. In this period he also acquired the linked estates of Auldhame and Scoughall. In 1868 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being Sir David Brewster.

Joining digital technology with scholarship, BDRC ensures that the ancient wisdom and cultural treasures of the Buddhist literary tradition are not lost, but are made available for future generations. BDRC is committed to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Founded in 1999 by E. Gene Smith, BDRC is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and hosts a digital library of the largest collection of digitized Tibetan texts in the world. Current programs focus on the preservation of texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. BDRC's Harvard Square headquarters facilitates its ongoing cooperative relationships with Harvard University. BDRC also has international offices in New Delhi, India and Kathmandu, Nepal, and is linked to the E. Gene Smith Library at Southwest University for Nationalities in Chengdu, China. History Traditional Tibetan Texts In the early 1960s, while working on his PhD at the University of Washington, E. Gene Smith studied with the Venerable Dezhung Rinpoche. In 1964, Dezhung Rinpoche encouraged Smith to move to India in order to seek out and study Tibetan books more directly. He gave Smith letters of introduction to show to the lamas living among the Tibetan diaspora. In 1968 the U.S. Library of Congress hired Smith as a field director in New Delhi where he worked on the Food for Peace humanitarian effort Public Law 480. Through the program, Smith began to copy and print thousands of Tibetan texts while keeping a version of each one for his own collection. He moved from India to Indonesia in 1985 and then Egypt, along with his collection of 12,000 volumes of texts. In 1997 Smith retired from the Library of Congress and began working to implement his vision of making the preserved texts accessible using the new scanning and digitization technologies that were, at that time, just beginning to become available. In 1999 with friends including Harvard professor and fellow Tibetologist Leonard van der Kuijp, he founded the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Smith's texts from India that were digitized at TBRC became the foundation for Tibetan studies in the United States. In 2002 with the support of Shelley and Donald Rubin, TBRC moved to New York City, where Smith became an advisor to the Rubin Museum of Art. Major grants from the Patricia and Peter Gruber Foundation, Khyentse Foundation, and the Shelley and Donald Rubin Foundation allowed TBRC to acquire a significant number of texts, develop its archiving system, and add more professional staff. Starting as technical director in 2001, Jeff Wallman was personally selected by Smith to be executive director and was appointed by the board of directors in 2009. Gene Smith died on December 16, 2010. TBRC had scanned 7 million pages of Tibetan texts at the time of his death. In 2017, TBRC announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond Tibetan, including Sanskrit, Pali and Chinese. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC) to Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese.Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)  BDRC's Work  Tibetan texts on a planetary book scanner next to a microfilm scanner BDRC seeks out and preserves undiscovered texts, organizes them into a library catalog system, and disseminates the library online and to remote locations on hard drives so anyone can read, print, or share the texts. Texts are cataloged by work, genre, subject, person, and place. Currently, the collection contains more than 26,000 works (72,000 volumes, totaling nearly 15 million pages) of Tibetan texts. Scholars and students are able to study the physical qualities of the texts since the scans are searchable and zoomable. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 pages are added every year. BDRC's work was recognized by the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje in a letter offering his support, gratitude, and prayers. Gene Smith's life and TBRC were the subject of the 2012 documentary Digital Dharma, directed by Dafna Yachin of Lunchbox Communications. Variety film critic John Anderson described the film as, \\"A divinely inspired gift... also an affectionate tribute to the late E. Gene Smith, the scholar, librarian and ex- Mormon who waged a 50-year struggle to save the endangered texts of Tibetan Buddhism.\\"  BDRC and Harvard  In summer 2012 BDRC relocated back to Harvard Square in Cambridge, MA, where the staff hand-picked by Smith continues its ongoing mission to preserve and provide access to Tibetan literature. In cooperation with the Harvard University Open Access Project (HOAP), BDRC is making its entire library completely open access. BDRC also coordinates internships with graduate students from Harvard Divinity School and the Department of South Asian Studies at Harvard.

Origin The nomen Oscius appears to be derived from the cognomen Oscus, referring to one of the Osci, an Italic people closely related to the Sabines and the Samnites, who gave their name to the Oscan language.

Bisset won the Newberry Gold Medal and a John Keppie Scholarship, which allowed him to travel to Germany, Austria and Denmark to further his studies. During 1933 he worked as an assistant teacher at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Einar Utzon-Frank. Bisset then spent two years at the British School in Rome before moving to Greece in 1935 where he was attached to the British School of Archaeology in Athens for three years. Bisset contributed plaster statues, now lost, of David Livingstone and James Watt for the Scottish Pavilion North which was part of the Empire Exhibition held in Glasgow in 1938. Many years later, he produced a relief panel, with an unusual take on the idea of the Grim Reaper, which was sited above the mortuary door of the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary. Bisset returned to Britain at the start of World War Two and settled in London. During 1939 he taught art and sculpture at the Brighton School of Art and later in 1939 took the post of Head of Sculpture at Leeds College of Art where he remained until 1946. In 1944, the War Artists' Advisory Committee purchased a bronze bust by Bisset of the Victoria Cross holder John Patrick Kenneally.

Each FGS uses a combination of optics and electronics to provide for pointing the telescope at a certain location in the sky. There are three Hubble FGS, and they have been upgraded over the lifetime of the telescope by manned Space Shuttle missions. The instruments can support pointing of 2 milli-arc seconds (units of degree).Fine Guidance Sensors Aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, the Scientific Capabilities of these Interferometer The three FGS are part of the Hubble Space Telescope's Pointing Control System, aka PCS. The FGS function in combination with the Hubble main computer and gyroscopes, with the FGS providing data to the computer as sensors which enables the HST to track astronomical targets. The FGS can be used to locate something in space, and then lock-on to it. It can provide the movements the telescope must make to keep the object in view, for the main instruments to record data on. The FGS were originally made by the optics company Perkin-Elmer, and as removable and repairable instruments it has been possible to refurbish them over the lifetime of the telescope. The first replacement FGS was installed in 1997, swapping out FGS1. In May 2009, on STS-125 a FGS was replaced during the mission to the Hubble telescope by the Space Shuttle. The astronaut crew performed an EVA (spacewalk) to service the FGS and other components on the telescope in Earth orbit. This was the SM4 mission. An example of astrometry science with the Hubble FGS system is observations of the Low-Mass Binary star system L722-22. Observations were taken of the system in 1990s, and the data helped determine the mass of each of the components of L722-22, which is also known as LHS 1047 and GJ 1005. The FGS are white-light shearing interferometers. The FGS weigh 220 kg (485 lb) and have dimensions of roughly 0.5 m √ó 1.0 m √ó 1.6 meters. Observations The smallest KBO yet detected at that time was discovered in 2009 by poring over data from the Hubble Space Telescope's fine guidance sensors. They detected a transit of an object against a distant star, which, based on the duration and amount of dimming, was calculated to be a KBO about in diameter. It has been suggested that the Kepler observatory may be able to detect objects in the Oort cloud by their occultation of background stars,DETECTABILITY OF OORT CLOUD OBJECTS USING KEPLER - 2009 and the Whipple proposal would also try to use this concept A Hubble FGS has also been used for astrometry, tracking the movement of different starts. This ability was used for exoplanet research, where the motion of the star caused by the movement of planets around it was detected. Hubble was used via the FGS sensors to detect the motion of star caused by an exoplanet orbiting it. The effect on the Star Gliese 876's by companion Gliese 876b was measured. That star is known as a red dwarf about 15 light-years away from Earth.Gliese 876 FGS was used to study Double-star systems (aka Binary star systems) and to measure distances to astronomical bodies. FGS has also been used to observer asteroids and calculate their size. Asteroids studied include (63) Ausonia, (15) Eunomia, (43) Ariadne, (44) Nysa, and (624) Hektor.

(Original description) The small shell has an elongate- fusiform shape. It is thin and fragile, white, turreted, axially costate and spirally striated. The sculpture consistis of narrowly rounded, slightly oblique axial riblets, about 16 on the body whorl, nearly continuous over the whorls, obsolete on the base. The interstices are slightly broader than the riblets. They are crossed by spiral threads,4 fine and close together on the shoulder, 1 on the carina of the whorl, and 3 below it, the uppermost of these at some distance from the keel. The crossing-points are produced into small oval gemmules. The base is spirally striate, all the striae in front of the aperture being smooth. The colour of the shell is white. The spire is elevated conic, turriculate, nearly 1¬Ω times the height of the aperture. The protoconch is globular, of 1¬Ω smooth whorls, the nucleus broadly rounded. The shell contains 6 whorls, regularly increasing, with a high sloping shoulder, the keel on the spire-whorls near the middle, flat above and below the keel. The base of the shell is contracted. The suture is somewhat impressed, lightly margined below. The aperture is pyriform, broadly angled above, with a short, broad, oblique, and truncated siphonal canal below. The outer lip is convex, thickened by an axial rib, slightly angled above, and somewhat contracted below, with a shallow broad sinus at the suture. The columella is slightly oblique, lightly excavated towards the straight parietal wall, curved below, and extending to the left margin of the siphonal canal. The inner lip is thin, narrow and smooth. Suter H. (1913‚Äì1915), Manual of New Zealand Mollusca; Wellington, N. Z. :J.

They are strongest and somewhat mucronate at the angulation, extending over the base, but not over the beak. There are many fine hairlike growth lines. The spirals there are a great many remote fine threads, finer and closer on the shoulder than on the body whorl. Those at the carination are strong, ornamented with minute granules, which swell into small tubercles in crossing the riblets. The interstices of the ribs and the spirals are microscopically granulated. The colour of the shell is semitransparent, flinty, white, with a crisp aspect. The spire is scalar, conoidal.

Background  On 21 February 2017, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) disrupted 'Cultures of Protest', a literature event organised by the English Department of the Ramjas College. On the morning of the 21st, ABVP members reached the Ramjas campus and started protesting the invitation to Umar Khalid and warned the organisers of violence if Khalid entered the campus. The college authorities, including college principal Rajendra Prasad and Prof. Mukul Mangalik, tried to reason with the protesting group but eventually gave up. Khalid, who had reached the nearby Vishwavidyalaya metro station turned back, on being informed of the situation by the organisers. To protest this, some students took out a rally within the college campus. When the rally returned to the venue of the event, they were welcomed by a hostile mob that pelted them with stones and chanted slogans like 'Vande Mataram' and 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'. The police then formed a cordon to allow the group into the venue. As the event continued, the ABVP members continued sloganeering outside. A student claimed that soon after a stone smashed through the window of the room. After this, those assembled had to evacuate through a back alley while the mob shouted threats of violence and rape against female students.

The group took hostage nine of the Israeli Olympic delegation after killing Israeli wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg and weightlifter Yossef Romano in the initial takeover. He was the uncle of Jamal Al-Gashey, who also took part in the Munich operation. Early life Al-Gashey was a former student of nursing in Tripoli, Libya and had won a scholarship to study chemistry at the American University of Beirut. Unlike some of his fellow fedayeen he did not have any connections with Germany, but was described by author Simon Reeve as \\"resourceful, reliable and committed.\\" Role in the Munich Massacre Though Al-Gashey was one of the eight terrorists involved in the attack at the Israeli delegations quarters in the Munich Olympic Village, unlike some of the other terrorists he is not easily identifiable in any of the footage of the day's events. Any mention of Al- Gashey in the crisis at all is identified by author Simon Reeve who in his book 'One day in September' (2000) cites Al-Gashey as the terrorist that machine gunned the Israeli's in the western helicopter. After the shootout at F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base he was captured along with his nephew Jamal Al- Gashey and Mohammed Safady. Aftermath Al Gashey, his nephew Jamal Al- Gashey and Mohammed Safady were released seven and a half weeks later on 29 October 1972 when Lufthansa flight 615 from Damascus to Frankfurt was hijacked by Arab terrorists. The hijackers demanded the release of the three surviving terrorists or they would blow up the plane. Without consulting the Israeli government, the West German government agreed and acquiesced to the terrorists demands. In a press conference given by the three surviving terrorists in Tripoli, Libya shortly after their release from Germany, Adnan Al-Gashey was questioned by a British journalist if he, personally, shot the Israelis. Al- Gashey replies in English. > Al-Gashey: It's not important to say if I killed Israeli or not. Reporter: > But they were unarmed, the Israeli hostages, did you shoot any of them > yourself? Al-Gashey: They are unarmed, but we have to know that Israeli is > our enemy, Israel is our enemy... so we have to kill Israeli because...(Cut > off by spokesman interjecting) Death Al-Gashey's death has caused something of a controversy in the wake of the Munich Massacre. In the Academy Award-winning documentary One Day in September (2000), it is stated that Israeli Mossad assassination squads killed both him and Mohammad Safady. However, in his book Striking Back: The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israel's Deadly Response, Aaron J. Klein states that Mossad reported Al-Gashey died naturally in Dubai sometime between 1978‚Äì1979, from a genetic heart condition. It can be assumed however that by the year 2000 with the publishing of Simon Reeve's book, Al-Gashey had died as his wife gives a description of him in the past tense. Portrayal on film Al-Gashey is portrayed by French Moroccan actor Karim Saidi in the film Munich (2005).

The society publishes a journal, the Folk Art Messenger three times a year, and holds an annual conference that includes a symposium with speakers as well as visits to folk art museums and private art collections. Members of the organization include artists, collectors, academics, and curators, as well as libraries and other arts organizations.  History  Ann and William Oppenhimer are considered the founders of the Folk Art Society of America and currently serve as the Executive Director and CFO respectively. Previously William served as the Chairman of the Executive Committee and Ann was the president of the organization. Before devoting her time to the Folk Art Society, Ann served on the art history faculty at the University of Richmond. As a member of the faculty she curated an exhibition of work from the acclaimed folk artist Howard Finster. The Oppenhimer's also have a significant folk art collection of their own, and their personal and professional interest served as a launch pad for activities of the society itself. Due to their initiative the society has, since its founding, produced its publication and held a conference every year. The regular publication of this magazine, as well as the maintenance of an updated website has led Ann Oppenhimer and the Folk Art Society to win numerous awards from the Virginia Professional Communicators.  Annual conference  In 2017, the Folk Art Society of America celebrates its 30th conference. The conferences are open to all who register. They include a symposium, a benefit art auction, studio tours, home tours, and museum visits. Local museums usually plan an exhibition to coincide with the occurrence of the Society's conference. At the conference the Society grants its annual Awards of Distinction, which are given to artists and scholars of folk art. A scholarship to attend the conference is given to a graduate student of folk art. In honor of one of the pioneers of folk art collecting, Herbert Hemphill Jr., a work of folk art is gifted to a museum or university, typically in the area the conference is being held. There is an annual auction that occurs at the conference to which members and folk artists submit artwork. Past locations of the conference include, Richmond 1988, Waverly (Va.) 1989, Washington 1990, Chicago 1991, Los Angeles 1992, New Orleans 1993, Santa Fe 1994, Atlanta 1995, Birmingham 1996, Milwaukee 1997, Houston 1998, Lexington/Morehead 1999, San Diego 2000, Richmond 2001, Savannah 2002, St. Louis 2003, Oakland 2004, Chicago 2005, Phoenix 2006, Louisville 2007, Washington 2008, St. Petersburg, Fla. 2009, Santa Fe 2010, Richmond 2011, Atlanta 2012, Raleigh 2013, Columbus 2014, Memphis 2015, and in 2016 St. Petersburg, Florida. In October 2017 the conference will be held in Santa Fe, the third time in this city.  Folk Art Messenger  The Folk Art Messenger is a journal that includes a variety of articles from writers on topics important to the folk art and self-taught art world including articles about folk artists, auctions, exhibitions, fairs, collectors and book reviews, as well as artists' obituaries. The magazine is known for its inclusive approach, focusing on the artists' struggles and successes, rather than hotly debated issues like what to call this type of art. Originally, the first Messenger was a black-and-white, 6-page fold out, but began to be published in color in 1997 with the 38th issue. Currently, the 40-page magazine carries no advertising and is the only American publication of its type published three time a year. The European counterpart to the Messenger, titled Raw Vision, was first published in 1989. While the Folk Art Messenger focuses mainly on American artists, the two have much in common and previously referenced each other.  Folk art environments  A folk art environment is a large-scale work of art created by a folk or self-taught artist. These works are identified and recorded by Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments, a non profit arts organization. The Folk Art Society has awarded 12 plaques of recognition to various folk art environments. The plaque from FASA identifies the site as worthy of preservation and protection. Recipients of this plaque include the Watts Towers, Howard Finster's Paradise Garden, the Miles B. Carpenter Museum, and Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village. Bottle Village, located in Simi Valley, Calif. was created by folk artist Tressa Prisbrey beginning in 1956. Following her death in 1988, the future of the village was uncertain. Many residents of the area found the site to be garish and wanted it demolished, however recognition from the Folk Art Society of America as well as the state's historic landmark program prevented its destruction after it was damaged in the Simi Valley earthquake in 1994.  Location  The Folk Art Society was founded in Richmond, Va and held its first conference in the city as well. Although the organization strives to span the nation and now holds conferences throughout the US, the headquarters remain in Richmond since the founding except for a brief interlude. In 2014, the Society became a part of Longwood University, renamed the Folk Art Society of America at Longwood Center for the Visual Arts or FASA@LCVA. The FASA office and archives were moved to Farmville, Va for two years as a part of this transition. However this relationship was later discontinued and the Society returned to Richmond in March 2016. Currently the Society is in the process of turning its archives over to the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Va., and will be working with Lee Shepard, the Vice President for Collections, in order to create a permanent archive that will be digitized and available for scholarly research.

Nela Arias-Misson was a contemporary and friend of the 20th-century painters Mark Rothko, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Karel Appel, Walasse Ting, and Antoni Tapies.Memorials ARIAS, MISSON, NELA. (2016, Jul 17). New York Times She exhibited internationally and was connected to many established figures in the art world throughout her life. Her art synthesizes her experiences as an ahead-of-her-time, determined, female artist, linking abstract expressionism in Cuba, the United States, and Europe.  Biography  = Early life and education = Nela Arias was born in Havana, Cuba on September 8, 1915. Her father, Amadeo Arias Rodriguez (who died when she was a child) and her mother, Sira Garcia Menendez, were from Asturias, Spain. They owned tobacco plantations in Cuba and traveled back and forth to Spain until World War I broke out and made trans-Atlantic travel impossible. As a result, they settled in Cuba. From early childhood, Nela Arias was fascinated by the world of art and even then started positioning herself to become a part of it. She studied with Armando Maribona (artist, journalist, professor at La Academia de Bellas Artes de San Alejandro and also Nela's relative) in Havana in the 1930s. Maribona was Nela's childhood mentor and no doubt helped nurture her artistic vocation. = Life in the United States = In 1941, Arias traveled to New York with her mother for medical treatment. They remained there several months and returned to Cuba by ship. On board, she met Willis Hesser Bird, a Sears, Roebuck & Company executive. Bird was a widower and had a six-year-old daughter, Barbara. They married in Havana two weeks later and moved to Haddonfield, New Jersey. Their daughter, Carole Bird, was born in Washington D.C. on August 9, 1942. Right after Carole was born, Willis Hesser Bird was called to serve in the US Army in the Office of Strategic Services (precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency). After a brief time in Washington DC, he went overseas, serving in the China-Burma-India Theater. The Army moved Nela Arias, her mother, grandmother, Carole and Barbara to Sarasota, Florida, an option given to officers‚Äô families during the war when no men were left at home. When the war ended, they all moved to New York City. Bird asked Nela to move the family to Thailand, where he chose to remain. She refused, deciding to stay in New York. Their marriage ended in 1949.  Career  In the mid-to- late 1940s, Nela Arias studied fashion design and art at the Traphagen School of Fashion, at the Hans Hofmann School, and Parsons School of Design of New York City.Henkes, Robert. Latin American Women Artists of the United States: The Works of 33 Twentieth-Century Women. Jefferson, N.C: McFarland, 1999. Print. In 1949, she married New York lawyer Sidney Kraft. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1955. During these years, she studied with Italian-American sculptor Leo Lentelli and at the Art Students League of New York, a formative school for the likes of Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, Clement Greenberg, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein, Helen Frankenthaler, Mark Rothko and Cuban artist of Asturian background, Amelia Pelaez del Casal. = Provincetown = Nela Arias was a student of Hans Hofmann (one of the major exponents of Abstract Expressionism and a former teacher at the Art Students League of New York) from 1957 to 1959. She became entrenched in the Provincetown, Massachusetts art community where she formed relationships and connected with internationally known figures such as Mark Rothko, Robert Motherwell, Franz Kline, and Willem de Kooning. She developed a friendship with Karel Appel, founder of the COBRA group. Nela Arias also became a close friend of Walasse Ting, an abstract-expressionist painter (with whom she collaborated on several works) known for authoring art books that included the participation of artists like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Tom Wesselmann, James Rosenquist, Asger Jorn, Pierre Alechinsky, Karel Appel, Kiki Kogelnik, Joan Mitchell, and Sam Francis. During these years Nela Arias showed at the Provincetown Art Association and New Gallery in Provincetown and wins first prize at the National Association of Women Artists of the Argent Gallery in New York in 1959, from which she resigned, wanting to receive the same recognition that male artists did. = Europe = From 1961 to 1976 Nela lived in Europe, settling first in Ibiza and Barcelona and later in Madrid and Brussels. She had exhibitions in: Britain, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Spain. While living in Europe she met Joan Mir√≥, who was then living in Palma de Mallorca, and Josep Llorens i Artigas, Miro's collaborator. She also was introduced to the painters of El Paso Group by her friend, artist Antoni Tapies. The artists invited her to join their group, but Nela rejected their offer. She preferred working independently. In 1963, Nela married Belgian poet-novelist-artist, Alain Misson. When they married, they decided to combine their names, and from then on, both used the surname Arias-Misson. Alain Arias-Misson, a co-founder of the visual poetry movement, collaborated closely on projects and performances with artists Joan Brossa, Herminio Molero, and Ignacio Gomez de Lia√±o, with whom Nela became close friends. In 1970, Galer√≠a C√©spedes of Cordoba and Cult-Art Gallery in Madrid were hosts to Nela's solo exhibitions. These galleries were known for exhibiting artists like Manolo Valdes, the Equipo Cr√≥nica, Luis Eduardo Aute, and Juan Antonio Guirado. In 1974, she and her husband had a joint exhibition at the Galeria Senatore in Stuttgart. The two also collaborated with Paul De Vree, Emile Kesteman, Carlfriedrich Clauss, and Seiichi Niikuni. In 1975, she participated in Phantomas, an exhibition of art and poetry at Musee d‚ÄôIxelles that included Enrico Baj, Bram Bogart, Marcel Broodthaers, Jean Dubuffet, Lucio Fontana, and Piero Manzoni, among others. = Return to the United States = The Arias- Missons lived in Europe until 1976 when they returned to the United States, and moved to a rural part of New Jersey. Nela Arias-Misson continued to paint, but lived quietly and withdrew from the art world. She occasionally exhibited individual pieces in New York, Dallas, and Paris and Germany. In 1993 she was in an automobile accident that required many major surgeries on her left arm and she was no longer able to paint as before. In 1995 Nela moved to New York City where she lived until she made her final move in 2002 when she settled in Miami.  Legacy  Nela Arias-Misson died in Miami on July 17, 2015, just a few weeks short of her 100th birthday. Her remains rest in a niche at El Cementerio de la Iglesia de San Esteban de Covera, Aviles, Spain.
