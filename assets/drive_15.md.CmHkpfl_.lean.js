Background At the outset of the First Seminole War, Andrew Jackson was called upon to proceed with his Tennessee and Georgia militias into southern Georgia and, if need be, northern Florida to bring about peace. Overzealous as he was, he took his bloated company, by then joined by friendly Lower Creek and Chehaw, and ran amok throughout Spanish Florida, capturing the Spanish towns of St. Marks and Pensacola. In doing so, however, he left southern Georgia settlers unprotected to the few hostile Lower Creek tribes who were emboldened by his absence. In lieu of these events, Governor William Rabun was forced to dispatch for a part of Jackson's army. However, Jackson was too far gone so as to effectively comply at the time, so Rabun issued orders for a militia at Hartford on April 4, 1818 made up of volunteers from Twiggs and Jones counties as well as a contingent of federal troops from Fort Early. This company, led by Captain Obed Wright, would seek to punish the two identified hostile tribes, the Phelemmes and the Hoppones along the Flint River by way of surprise.Coulter, 1965. p. 372 Attack On April 21, Wright embarked with 270 men for Chehaw, which he had decided to attack instead, because he believed a chief of the Hoppones had taken up residence there, the result of being \\"misled by false information\\". With that, he left without the fort commander who refused to accompany him, insisting Chehaw was a friendly village. Nevertheless, the next day, with little resistance, Wright's force burned the village down, killing 40 to 50 warriors (or so Wright claimed at the time) in the process without any U.S. loss of life. Meanwhile, seven other accounts saw the death toll between five and ten.Coulter, 1965. p. 374. Conflicting Accounts The death toll wasn't the only fact disputed and it wasn't the most contentious. One second hand account in the local paper claimed an Indian man emerged from his house with a white flag, only to be murdered alongside his son, while another explained how the militia were the ones waving a white flag, but that it was done in order to trick the Chehaw into a false sense of security.Coulter, 1965. p. 374. A decade later, Jackson himself, used the event as a sort of propaganda in his 1832 campaign for the presidency. Author of Jackson's biography, Philo A. Goodwin, who had defended Jackson's campaign into Florida, embellished the cruelty and barbarism on display that fateful day: \\"a deeper stain of dishonor or a more intense visitation of wo [sic], was never seen or inflicted, than at the secluded village of the Chehaws.\\" Reaction While many newspapers including the Augusta Chronicle, Savannah Republican, National Intelligencer and Niles' Register strongly criticized Wright's actions, Judge C. B. Strong of the Georgia Superior Court and Governor Rabun, \\"who took on the responsibility\\", rushed to his defense.Coulter, 1965. p. 376-7. The events would have remained relatively local in newsworthiness had it not been for Jackson, who upon hearing of them, was furious for it was at Chehaw where he'd been generously resupplied and joined by 40 brave warriors. In a letter to one of his subordinates on May 7, he wrote of an \\"outrageous and inhuman attack\\" that \\"will be a stigma on the American nation, unless the general government use their endeavors to bring the perpetrators to justice.\\" He then wrote a scolding letter to Governor Rabun ordering the arrest and military prosecution of Wright.Coulter, 1965. p. 378. Rabun responded with indignation, pointing to Jackson's non-response to his earlier letter in Florida. Both followed up by writing Secretary of War John C. Calhoun on the matter.Coulter, 1965. p. 379-80. This correspondence, which thusly continued for some time, was published nationally.Coulter, 1965. p. 381. Once again, editors, this time across the country, including those at the Georgia Journal and Richmond Enquirer, saw the military man, Jackson, in the wrong for his temperance toward Rabun and assertions regarding the Governor's authority.Coulter, 1965. p. 381. Legal Action On December 10, 1818, a resolution introduced to the House by Henry R. Storrs of New York requested copies of any correspondence between Rabun, Jackson and the executive departments and on the 12th President Monroe complied. Monroe later requested Congress seek all documents relating to the Chehaw Affair, which Thomas W. Cobb of Georgia and Abner Lacock of Pennsylvania requested at the President's wishes.Coulter, 1965. p. 381-2. Meanwhile, William McIntosh, in correspondence with Jackson, sought to bring the men who had murdered his uncle (chief of Chehaw) and the inhabitants of the village to justice. He called for an assembly of the Creek nation on June 7, 1819.Coulter, 1965. p. 382. In the end, Indian Agent David Brydie Mitchell was provided with $10,000 by the U.S. government, with which to compensate the Chehaws. As for the fate of Wright, he was located and arrested by Major John M. Davis. Davis was forced to release him, however, while passing through the state capital, then located in Milledgeville, on his way to Fort Hawkins after a Georgia Inferior Court ruled in Davis' favor. Once he was released, Governor Rabun had him arrested so that he could be tried by a United States civil court rather than one of Jackson's martial courts.Coulter, 1965. p. 385-6. Having received letters urging for both outcomes, President Monroe conferred with Secretaries John Quincy Adams and William H. Crawford on June 26, reaching the conclusion that Wright should fall under the circuit court's jurisdiction unless they should disclaim him.Worthington c. Ford, ed., Writings of John Quincy Adams (7 vols. New York, 1913-19.17), VI, 358-59; In the meantime, Wright, unaware of the relative victory in Washington, caught wind of a rumor published in the Savannah Republican that he would be tried before a special court for murder. So, in the darkness of the night on July 27, as Niles' Register reported, Wright \\"took the fatal resolution to flee from justice\\" fearing \\"that his conduct would not be impartially investigated.\\"Coulter, 1965. p. 390. He was months later spotted one last time by an acquaintance in St. Augustine, Florida on his way to Havana, Cuba.

Describing the Chehaw as a \\"friendly agricultural people...who aided our early settlers\\", it proceeds to (fittingly) put forth its own version of the events: \\"Here also, in 1818, through misunderstanding, were sacrificed seven of this tribe by Georgia troops, for which all possible amends were made.\\"Coulter, 1965. p. 369.

A partlet or partlett is a fashion accessory of the sixteenth century. The partlet was a sleeveless garment worn over the neck and shoulders, or to fill in a low neckline. The earliest partlets appeared in late 15th century fashion. They were made of silk or linen, and were worn to fill in the low V necklines of both men's and women's Burgundian dress. Men continued to wear partlets, usually of rich materials, with the low-cut doublets of the early 16th-century. Early 16th-century women's partlets were made in a variety of fabrics and colors, although black was most popular. Black partlets worn over the gown, usually of velvet or satin for the upper classes are an early style. A wardrobe warrant of June 1538 ordered black velvet for a \\"French partlet\\" for Princess MaryHayward (2007), p. 166 These black partlets may be seen in a number of portraits of Tudor court ladies by Hans Holbein the Younger, as well as in Netherlandish paintings of market women throughout the sixteenth century. Fine lawn (linen) partlets, with small standing collars and ruffles, could be worn directly over a low-necked smock, or over the kirtle. The \\"Pelican\\" portrait of Elizabeth I shows the Elizabethan fashion for matching partlet and sleeves worked with blackwork embroidery, in this instance covered with a sheer layer of cypress decorated with narrow stripes of gold lace. Such sets of parlet and sleeves were common New Year's gifts to the queen. In 1562 Lady Cobham gave her \\"a partelett and a peire of sleeves of sypers wrought with silver and black silke\\". Elaborate lattice-work partlets were made of gold and jewels or pearls, such as that worn by Eleanor of Toledo in the portrait by Bronzino. This was called \\"Caulle fashion\\" in England.Hayward (2007), p. 167 The origin of the term partlet (attested from 1515) is uncertain, but it may derive from Dame Partlet, a traditional name for a hen, perhaps in reference to the ruffle of feathers on some hens' necks. For similar garments, see guimpe and chemisette.

In 1951, Alves made history when she and actor Walter Forster performed the first on-screen kiss ever broadcast on Brazilian television on the early telenovela series, Sua Vida Me Pertence. In 1963, Alves made television history once again by sharing the first gay kiss shown on Brazilian television with actress Ge√≥rgia Gomide on the teleteatro show, TV de Vanguarda. Additionally, Alves co-founded the Associa√ß√£o dos Pioneiros da Televis√£o, or Association of Television Pioneers (Pr√≥-TV), in 1995 and operated the Museu da Televis√£o Brasileira from her home in S√£o Paulo. Biography Vida Alves was born on April 15, 1928, in Itanhandu, a mining city in Minas Gerais. She moved to the city of S√£o Paulo to pursue acting. She began her career in radio before transitioning to film and early television roles. Her film roles included Paix√£o Tempestuosa in 1954 and A Pequena √ìrf√£ in 1973. Alves was cast in Sua Vida Me Pertence, Brazil's first telenovela and a pioneer of the television genre, which debuted on TV Tupi in 1951. She co- starred in the series with Walter Forster, an actor who was also TV Tupi's director. In 1951, Alves and Forster shared the first on-screen kiss ever broadcast on Brazilian television. Alves and Forster rehearsed their scene in her living room under the watch of her husband, Gianni Gasparinetti, who gave his permission. Alves and Gasparinetti were newlyweds at the time and Forster was a close friend of the couple. According to Alves, who spoke of the scene in a December 2016 interview, \\"We [She and Forster] lived very close, a block away...It was a technical kiss. Walter Foster showed up at my house and said, 'Let's rehearse.' My husband thought it was kind of weird, but he agreed.\\" Alves historic kiss was performed live on television and not taped, so unfortunately no copy of Brazil's first on-screen kiss exists. Alves called the early telenovelas aired in the 1950s \\"simpler\\" than today's series, since the shows were only broadcast two or three times per week, rather than airing daily episodes. During the 1950s and 1960s, TV Tupi also aired a teleteatro show called TV de Vanguarda, which broadcast television adaptations of literary novels and plays. Teleteatro were a type of Brazilian television show that featured a complete story arc with a beginning, middle and ending broadcast in a single, two-hour episode. In 1963, Alves appeared in an episode of the series called A Cal√∫nia in which she and actress Ge√≥rgia Gomide shared a kiss, marking the first gay kiss ever broadcast on Brazilian television in the country's history. The plot of A Cal√∫nia featured two staff members of an all-girls boarding school, played by Alves and Gomide, who become the subjects of rumors that they were gay. Alves plays the director of the school, while Gomide portrays her colleague. Upon hearing the rumors, outraged parents complain and the school is forced to closed. On the day the school closes, Alves and Gomide look at each other, kiss and realize they are actually in love. In a 2011 interview with √âpoca magazine, Alves called the landmark kiss \\"tender\\", since their characters had not realized their feelings for each other until that moment. In 1995, Alves and several television co-founded the Associa√ß√£o dos Pioneiros Profissionais e Incentivadores da Televis√£o Brasileira (Pr√≥-TV), a professional organization. She also operated the Museu da Televis√£o Brasileira, including special exhibitions, at her own home in S√£o Paulo for thirteen years. Alves released two books focusing on her career during her later life. A biography titled Vida Alves - Sem medo de viver, authored by Nelson Natalino, was published by Editora Imprensa Oficial in 2013. Alves also wrote a second book, Televis√£o brasileira: O primeiro beijo e outras curiosidades (Brazilian television: The first kiss and other curiosities), which she released in 2014. Alves was interviewed by BBC Brasil in December 2016, just weeks before her death. Alves began suffering from declining health in 2016. She was hospitalized in Sancta Maggiore hospital in S√£o Paulo on December 28, 2016, just weeks after her BBC Brasil interview. She died at the same hospital from multiple organ failure on January 3, 2017, at the age of 88. She was survived by two children, three grandchildren, including Brazilian singer Ti√™, and three great-grandchildren. Alves was buried in the Cemit√©rio do Ara√ß√° in S√£o Paulo.

Various mechanisms have been proposed to increase the size of the Earth's orbit. The most plausible method would involve redirecting asteroids or comets roughly about 100 km wide via gravity assists around the Earth's orbit and towards Jupiter or Saturn and back in order to gradually move the Earth away from the Sun in order to keep it within the continuously habitable zone. However, this scenario has many practical drawbacks: besides the fact that such a scenario spans vast timescales far longer than human history, it would also put life on Earth at risk, as the repeated encounters could cause the Earth to potentially lose its Moon, therefore severely disrupting Earth's climate and rotation. Additionally, the encounters would require said asteroids or comets to pass extremely dangerously close to Earth, and one slight miscalculation would end up causing the asteroid or comet to hit the Earth instead and potentially sterilizing it, at least down to the level of bacteria, and that the damage done cannot be overemphasized.

The Trust was established by the Government in September 1927. The Wellington Street Markets were formally opened on 14 June 1929 by the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, John Willcock. The site incorporated an auctioneering area (72,750 sq ft), meat markets (2,400 sq ft) and egg and poultry markets (9,900 sq ft). The site also included a public restaurant, post office and several bank branch offices. By the 1950s protective restrictions on road transport by the Road Transport Regulation Board were being lightened, and more trucking of produce into and away from the markets was beginning to have effect on Wellington Street. The closing down of various freight services on the Western Australian Government Railways system as it was changed to a bulk freight operation, and its new brand and style of operation, saw the location of the markets and proximity to the central business district and the high land values as a problem. Various reviews and changes to processes at the markets were occurring prior to the closure. In 1990, the Metropolitan Market Trust changed its name to the Perth Market Authority and in 1989 the Authority relocated the markets to a site in Canning Vale. The original market site has since been redeveloped and is the site of Watertown Brand Outlet Centre and the offices of the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia.

She is a four-time International Ribbon Tag Team Champion, while also being a former two-time ICE√ó‚àû Champion. Early life Sera was born in Sera, Hiroshima. After graduating high school, she moved to Tokyo and studied voice acting at Amusement Media Academy (AMG). In 2012, Sera took part in the audition for \\"Taiyo kara Plancha\\" (), a movie collaboration with Ice Ribbon, and she won the main role on the condition that she had to actually make her wrestling debut with other winners of the audition, which made Ice Ribbon's recruiting project likewise in \\"Muscle Venus.\\" Until then, she used her real name Risa Okuda. Professional wrestling career =Ice Ribbon (2012‚Äìpresent)= Sera in July 2016 Sera was trained by Tsukasa Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida and made her debut on November 10, 2012, at the Ice Ribbon dojo under the ring name Risa Sera, defeated by Hamuko Hoshi. A half of her co- actors quit wrestling early, but she, 235 and Rutsuko Yamaguchi (retired in 2014 due to knee injury) remained to be on the roster. On January 4, 2014, Sera teamed up with Maki Narumiya and named their tag team \\".STAP\\". They defeated Tsukushi and Kurumi at the Korakuen Hall event on March 30 to become the International Ribbon Tag Team Champions. Until the next year, they successfully retained the championship for nine times. The team was dissolved as Narumiya left Ice Ribbon by March 31, 2015. They were defeated in a hardcore tag match against Isami Kodaka and Yuko Miyamoto in their last match, then Sera challenged Narumiya to a hardcore tag match. They had the match on May 4 and Sera's team were defeated. Sera demanded an even harder rematch with light tubes, but this was declined by management of Ice Ribbon, because it would be deviating from the main concept of the promotion. Sera declared that she would boycott the next Korakuen Hall event on June 24, but eventually she held her own event there after Ice Ribbon's event for just one match called \\"Human Hair Death Match\\" () and made peace with Narumiya after being defeated again. Since then, Sera held two \\"Death Match\\" events collaborating with Ice Ribbon. They were made of fun matches by Ice Ribbon's wrestlers and really hardcore matches including ladders, barbed wires and light tubes by Sera, so practically she made the promotion compromise on the matter. On November 14, 2015, Sera formed a new tag team with Maya Yukihi, and named the team \\"Azure Revolution\\". On March 21, Sera challenged Hamuko Hoshi for the ICE Cross Infinity Championship, and defeated Hoshi by a diving double knee drop to win her first title as a single player. On May 3, Sera headlined Ice Ribbon's 10th anniversary event at Yokohama Cultural Gymnasium to successfully defend the championship against Yuka. Sera was defeated by Tsukasa Fujimoto at korakuen Hall event on July 3 and lost the title, but the title went vacant by the result of the November 3 event, and on December 31, Sera won the tournament for the championship, defeating Fujimoto in the finals, and regained the title.

It first became legal on 5 May 2017, when the Supreme Court of Bermuda declared that same-sex couples had a legal right to marry in the territory after a couple filed suit against the Bermudian Government. However, a bill to ban same-sex marriage and establish domestic partnerships was passed by the Parliament in December 2017 and went into effect on 1 June 2018 though same-sex marriages performed before that day remained legally recognised. In response to the renewed ban on same-sex marriage, two legal challenges were filed opposing the domestic partnership law. On 6 June 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the parts of the domestic partnership law that banned same-sex marriages but stayed the ruling while the government appealed to the Court of Appeal. It upheld the right of same-sex couples to marry when it handed down its ruling on 23 November 2018. Same-sex couples are free to marry in the territory while an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is under way. History The Bermudian Government first made clear in 2004 that it would not consider the recognition of civil unions or same-sex marriages. In May 2006, MP Renee Webb tabled a private member's bill to add sexual orientation to the Human Rights Act 1981. The bill was squashed when the Parliament of Bermuda refused to discuss it. Socially, the situation was hard enough that some gay residents had chosen to emigrate, particularly to London, United Kingdom, where Bermudians and other British Overseas Territories citizens have a right to reside, to be able to live openly. One such emigrant noted that same-sex relationships had to essentially be secret, with partners introduced only as \\"friends\\" and relationships between two Bermudians as being very difficult. In June 2013, Parliament passed legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation under the human rights law. On 18 June 2013, newly-elected Premier Craig Cannonier ruled out same-sex marriage in Bermuda: \\"I can assure you that under my leadership this is not about same-sex marriage, and under my leadership that will not happen.\\" An amendment to Section 15 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1974, which required marriage to be between a man and a woman, was introduced to Parliament in 2016. The amendment would override the Human Rights Act 1981's anti- discrimination provisions on the basis of sexual orientation and retain language stating that marriage is limited to a man and a woman. On 8 July 2016, the House of Assembly passed the bill by 20 votes to 10. On 21 July 2016, the Senate rejected the legislation 5‚Äì6.Bermuda Senate narrowly rejects anti-marriage billSenate rejects Human Rights Act Amendment =Referendum (2016)= On 11 February 2016, Attorney General Trevor Moniz announced that the government would introduce a bill to create civil unions for same-sex couples.

Voters were asked two questions: \\"Are you in favour of same-sex marriage in Bermuda?\\" and \\"Are you in favour of same-sex civil unions in Bermuda?\\" Opposition Leader Marc Bean added that after the results of the referendum are announced, the government would govern accordingly. The non-binding referendum on same-sex unions was held in Bermuda on 23 June 2016.Bermuda same-sex marriage referendum set for June 23 Jamaica Observer, 12 May 2016Referendum (Same Sex Relationships) Act 2016 Bermuda Laws OnlineReferendum (Same Sex Relationships) Notice 2016 Bermuda Laws Online Both proposals were rejected by 60‚Äì70% of voters though the referendum was legally invalid, as less than 50% of eligible voters turned out. =Legal proceedings= A November 2015 ruling from the Supreme Court of Bermuda found that the same-sex partners of Bermuda residents should have the same rights to employment and benefits as all other spouses in Bermuda without restrictions from immigration requirements. The government did not indicate that it would appeal the decision; but it asked for implementation of the judgment to be suspended for an evaluation of the full scope of the judgment on such laws affecting \\"bankruptcy, estates, wills, succession rules, the right to inherit or receive bequests, health insurance legislation, pensions and social insurance\\". The ruling came into effect on 29 February 2016. In June 2016, after the referendum, two same-sex couples indicated they would apply for marriage licenses and hope for a court ruling to settle the issue. On 6 July 2016, a male same-sex couple filed notice of their intent to marry with an accompanying letter from their attorney requesting that the banns be posted within two days. The letter went on to state that unless the registrar notified the parties within two days, proceedings would be initiated in the Supreme Court of Bermuda. On 8 July 2016, the Registrar General's office rejected the application to publish banns for the same-sex couple that had applied for a license earlier in the week, which prompted their attorney to file a writ asking the Supreme Court to determine if the refusal contravened the provisions of the Human Rights Act. The case was heard by acting Chief Justice Charles-Etta Simmons of the Supreme Court on 1‚Äì3 February 2017. Supreme Court ruling (2017) Judge Charles-Etta Simmons issued her ruling in favour of same-sex marriage on 5 May 2017. Judge Simmons wrote that \\"on the facts, the applicants (Winston Godwin and his Canadian fianc√©, Greg DeRoche) were discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation when the Registrar refused to process their notice of intended marriage.... The applicants are entitled to an Order of Mandamus compelling the Registrar to act in accordance with the requirements of the Marriage Act 1944 and a declaration that same-sex couples are entitled to be married under the Marriage Act 1944.\\" The Rainbow Alliance issued a statement praising the ruling: \\"the ruling is a victory for all same-gender loving people in Bermuda [and] ensures that same-gender couples can enjoy the same legal protections as heterosexual spouses do\\". The group Preserve Marriage criticised the ruling as \\"an attack on traditional marriage [and] on Christian and other faith-based traditional values\\". Judge Simmons' ruling included a draft order giving effect to the judgement, but she heard from counsel on precise terms of the final order before giving it effect. The final order, which included a requirement on the part of the government to pay the petitioners' legal costs, was published on 22 September 2017. On 9 May 2017, Minister of Home Affairs Patricia Gordon-Pamplin said that the government would not appeal the ruling. The Registrar General posted the first wedding banns for a same-sex couple on 17 May, and the first same-sex marriage ceremony in Bermuda was celebrated on 31 May 2017. The ruling was welcomed by the operators of several cruise lines with Bermuda-flagged ships on which marriage ceremonies are performed under Bermuda law. The Preserve Marriage organisation, which intervened in the proceedings, and a separate group opposed to same-sex marriage sought to appeal the decision to the full bench of the Supreme Court, but leave to appeal was not granted. =Domestic Partnership Act 2018= After the July 2017 elections, which resulted in the Progressive Labour Party (PLP) returning a comfortable majority of MPs in the House of Assembly, PLP MP Wayne Furbert stated he would reintroduce a bill banning same-sex marriage to the Parliament in September and that he expected the bill to pass. Furbert stated the bill would need to be passed by only the Senate if it was amended. If it passed in its current form it would not need the approval of the Senate before being sent to the Governor for royal assent. The government stated that if Furbert's private member's bill passed the Parliament, it would draft a bill allowing same-sex couples rights equal to non-married heterosexual couples, akin to civil unions. After Furbert's announcement, several experts doubted the capacity of the bill to avoid Senate scrutiny, particularly if it was amended to make arrangements for existing same-sex marriages. On 2 November 2017, the newly-elected government introduced a bill to replace same-sex marriage with domestic partnerships. Two weeks of public consultation on the bill was held in various locations. The bill was strongly criticised by human rights groups, the Human Rights Commission and the Rainbow Alliance of Bermuda, which called it \\"an embarrassment\\" and \\"disappointing\\". The law would provide domestic partners with many of the same rights as married couples, particularly in areas such as pensions, inheritance, healthcare, tax, and immigration. The bill was debated in the House of Assembly and passed by a 24‚Äì10 vote on 8 December 2017. It then passed the Senate by an 8‚Äì3 vote on 13 December 2017. The provision of royal assent, usually a formality, was debated in the British Parliament and the subject of a lengthy review by Her Majesty's Government and the Governor of Bermuda. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson received calls to withhold his approval of the bill, as territorial governors may refuse to assent certain bills but require the approval of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to do so.Boris Johnson under fire for allowing ban on same-sex marriage Eventually, on 7 February 2018, the Governor provided assent to the bill, allowing the law to go into effect on a day to be appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs.Domestic Partnership Act 2018 (refer to p. 31 for note on commencement) A number of international politicians and human rights organisations criticised the change and argued that the move would ultimately damage the island's tourist industry.Gay MP says Bermuda's ban on same-sex marriage will damage Britain's reputation Same-sex marriages performed before the law commenced would remain recognised under the new law.Bermuda trades same-sex marriage for domestic partnerships The Bermudian Tourism Authority expressed fears and concerns that Bermuda would experience an economic fallout if the law went into effect.Bermuda repeals same-sex marriage Bermuda's repeal of same-sex marriage received significant and considerable international media coverage.International Media Report On Marriage Law Bernews, 8 February 2018 The Guardian and The New York Times reported that \\"Bermuda had become the first country to repeal same-sex marriage\\".Bermuda becomes first nation to legalize gay marriage, then repeal it The New York Times, 8 February 2018 The repeal was met with calls for a boycott. #BoycottBermuda quickly began trending on Twitter and other social media outlets.'Truly evil': Calls to boycott Bermuda for unprecedented repeal of same-sex marriage In response, LGBT groups proposed challenging the new law in court, as it \\"removes an established fundamental human right\\". Lawyer Mark Pettingill, who successfully argued before the Supreme Court in 2017 that same-sex marriage was a human right, said that any further legal action would need to be heard in higher, namely European, courts.Pettingill says battle may be far from over On 28 February 2018, the Minister of Home Affairs, Walter Roban, announced that the Domestic Partnership Act 2018 would take effect on 1 June 2018. Same-sex couples who wished to marry before that date had to apply for a marriage licence by 12 May. The Commencement Notice was issued on 9 April 2018. Legal challenges A challenge against the law was filed with the Supreme Court on 16 February 2018. A second lawsuit against the law was announced on 3 April 2018. A hearing was held on 21 and 22 May 2018 before the Chief Justice of the court. The court ruled on the matter on 6 June 2018, revoking the parts of the law that prevented same-sex couples from marrying and held that \\"maintaining or restoring a definition of marriage that disadvantaged those who believe in same-sex marriage discriminated against them on the grounds of their creed contrary to section 12 of the Bermuda Constitution\\". The court agreed to an application by the Attorney-General to stay the ruling by six weeks to allow the government to consider an appeal. On 5 July, the Minister of Home Affairs, Walter Roban, confirmed that an appeal had been filed with the Court of Appeal. The court heard oral arguments on 7, 8 and 9 November 2018. On 23 November, the court upheld the Supreme Court's ruling and refused to stay the decision. On 13 December 2018, Roban announced that the government had applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal the ruling to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. On 29 May 2019, Roban said that permission to appeal had been granted. The government filed the notice of appeal on 12 July 2019. The appeal will be heard on 3‚Äì4 February 2021. A March 2019 estimate showed that the court cases surrounding same-sex marriage had cost US$120,000-150,000. However, a May 2019 estimate by association OutBermuda suggested that the total cost of the court cases is likely to cost taxpayers as much as US$3 million. =Statistics= Between May 2017 and June 2018, 20 same-sex couples married in Bermuda, of which 14 on the island itself and 6 on board Bermudian-registered ships. By May 2019, there had been two more same-sex marriages since the Court of Appeal's judgment in November 2018. By May 2019, three couples had entered into domestic partnerships. Public opinion An opinion poll in July 2010 showed 27% of respondents in favour of same-sex marriage and 51% against. An October 2015 poll by Global Research commissioned by The Royal Gazette found that 48% of Bermudians supported same-sex marriage and that 44% opposed it.Poll: support for same-sex marriage An August 2020 opinion poll conducted by Global Research showed that 53% of Bermudians supported same-sex marriage. Support was higher among 18‚Äì34-year-olds at 64%. 95% of respondents felt that the legalisation of same-sex marriage had not negatively affected them, and 75% opposed the government spending more money on the issue in court.

He was the nephew of James Blair, the founder of the College of William and Mary, and father of John Blair, Jr., a delegate to the Constitutional Convention and associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. Early life Blair was born in Scotland around 1687, the only known son of Archibald Blair, and immigrated as a child with his family to Virginia in the 1690s. Archibald was a brother of James Blair, the founder of the College of William and Mary in Williamsbury. Archibald operated an apothecary shop in Williamsburg. John Blair graduated from the College of William and Mary around 1707 and remained in Williamsburg his whole life. Public career Blair's public career may have begun in 1715, when he or a cousin with the same name was appointed keeper of the Royal Storehouse in Williamsburg. Blair took the oaths of office as a justice of the peace for York County on August 17, 1724 (serving until he was sworn in as a member of the Virginia Governor's Council in 1745) and in 1727 as a James River upper district naval officer (serving until he became deputy Auditor General of Virginia on August 15, 1728). He served as deputy Auditor General until his death in 1771, while simultaneously holding various other positions. Blair was elected to the House of Burgesses from Jamestown from 1734 to 1736, succeeding his father. Subsequently, he was then elected to represent Williamsburg from 1736 to 1740 where he dealt with issues of the defense of colonists from attacks by Indians. From April 22, 1741 to October 15, 1741, he served as clerk of the Governor's Council. During part of that time, his uncle James Blair was the acting governor. He is likely the John Blair who was Williamsburg's mayor in 1751. Blair having inherited approximately ¬£10,000 from his uncle James, Governor William Gooch now considered him qualified for a seat on the upper house of the colonial legislature, the Virginia Governor's Council and recommended to the king in February 1745 that he be appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, the king had already named Blair to fill a different vacancy on November 15, 1744. He was seated on August 6, 1745. He became the council's senior member or president in 1757 and served four times as Virginia's acting governor. The first was after the departure of Robert Dinwiddie, from January 12, 1758 to June 5, 1758, when Francis Fauquier arrived. The second time was in September and October 1761 when Fauquier was consulting with General Jeffery Amherst in New York. In 1763, Blair was acting governor when Fauquier was in the Province of Georgia in September to December. The final time was after Fauquier's death on March 4, 1768 until the arrival of his replacement, Norborne Berkeley on October 26, 1768. Although appointed for life, he resigned on October 15, 1770 after the death of governor Berkeley. In poor health himself, he did not want to serve as acting governor again for the fifth time. He died the following year. Blair having a large family to support, the Council petitioned the king to grant Blair a pension. The king and Privy Council did not act before Blair's death. =Deputy Auditor General= Holding the position for 43 years, he was responsible for certifying the accuracy of official government revenue accounts, including quitrents and taxes on exported tobacco, then a major component of Virginia's agricultural production. Blair successfully improved procedures and records to prevent the evasion of paying quitrents. However, in his final years the efficacy of the office was poor, probably due to his failing health and the death of his assistant. Blair's son became the next deputy auditor general. =Governor's Council= In 1746, he voted to license Reverend Samuel Davies to preach in Williamsburg, one of the first non- Anglican ministers licensed in Virginia. This was not popular with the established church as Davies advanced the cause of religious and civil liberty and preached to religious dissenters against the Anglican Church. =Governor= During his first term as acting governor in 1758, he addressed the General Assembly on March 31 requesting that Virginia raise an additional regiment for offensive operations in the Ohio Valley against the New France forces in the French and Indian War, which was approved. Also approved was the issuance of ¬£32,000 of treasury notes to fund defenses of the colony. In 1768, Fauquier had intended to call the Assembly into session. After Fauquier died, Blair, again acting Governor, followed through with a session that closed in April at which time he sent to the king and Parliament the assembly's challenges, led by speaker Peyton Randolph of Parliament's right to tax the colonies. The response was the speedy appointment of Berkeley as new governor with instructions to quash such protests of the crown's authority over the colonies. Blair also urged Virginia's clergy to raise money to aid the victims of a fire in Old Montreal (then under British rule) that destroyed the Congregation Notre-Dame convent and 88 houses. =Other civic action= Blair served on a 1745 committee to revise the laws of Virginia, on a committee that oversaw the 1748‚Äì1753 rebuilding of the Capitol after it burned in 1747, and on another in 1763 to correspond with Virginia's London agent. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the public hospital for lunatics established in 1769. Blair was the only participant in the bricklaying ceremonies for both of the Williamsburg Capitol buildings (in 1699 or 1701 and 1752 or 1754). Religious duty Blair served as a vestryman of Bruton Parish, from around 1744 or earlier, and was a churchwarden about 1749. He was also a visitor of the College of William and Mary in 1758. Williamsburg business interests Until his death in 1733, Blair's father, Archibald, was the largest shareholder of Dr. Blair's Store, a mercantile house. Blair was the store's manager. Blair was also a partner with John Blair Jr. (the son of a cousin) in another store from 1740 to 1759. Blair owned one the largest taverns in the colony, the Raleigh Tavern, named after Sir Walter Raleigh and the Chowning Tavern, renting them to tavern keepers. He owned Chowning from 1726 to around 1738, and sold Raleigh in 1742. In 1745, he was a partner with 16 others in a land grant on the Potomac and Youghiogheny rivers. Personal Blair married his first cousin Mary Munro about 1726. Munro, the daughter of the Reverend John and Christina Monro of St. John's Parish, King William County, was born circa 1708 and died 1768 They had ten children, including eight daughters. Their fourth child, John Blair, Jr. became an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. One daughter was named Agan (Scottish for Anna), who married Colonel John Banister. She was born in 1746 and died in 1813. Another daughter, Mary (Born September 27, 1734), married on December 6, 1753 Colonel George Braxton who died October 3, 1761, and on December 31, 1774 Colonel R. Burwell who died January 30, 1777, and lastly on June 2, 1795 to Mr. R Prescott who died June 2, 1795. A third daughter was Elizabeth (Betsy), who married Captain/Commander/Admiral Thompson. A fourth daughter, Christian (1727‚Äì1784), married Armistead Burwell who was elected Burgess in 1753‚Äì1754. His son Dr. James Blair married in 1771 and shortly thereafter separated from his wife and died the next year. This led to a dower lawsuit between his estate and wife (Blair v Blair), involving his brother John as executor and Thomas Jefferson and Edmund Randolph as council. Some considered this matter a scandal. John Blair Sr. died in Williamsburg on November 5, 1771 and was buried in Bruton Parish churchyard. Blair and his family likely lived in the John Blair House, presently located on Duke of Gloucester Street in the National Register of Historic Places district living history museum of Colonial Williamsburg. The house was originally built in the mid 18th century (1747) and is one of the oldest in Williamsburg. The house features typical American colonial architecture, including hip roof dormers. The stone steps were imported from England. The house was reconstructed in 1937. According to Blair's diary, he loved gardening and maintained a garden with flowers, vegetables, and a fruit tree orchard.

orchestral composition by the Romanian composer George Enescu, left incomplete at the composer's death, but finished in 1996 by Pascal Bentoiu. History Enescu began sketching his Fourth Symphony in 1928, but did not return to it in earnest until after completing the orchestration of his opera ≈ídipe in 1931. Although he worked on the symphony from 1932, he broke off work in December 1934 after achieving a complete draft and a partial orchestration. He briefly resumed work in the spring of 1939, but it remained incomplete at his death (; ). Enescu made two orchestrated drafts of the first movement. The first is undated, while the second one, dated 20 October (or possibly 20 December according to ) 1934, also continues the orchestration into the second movement, extending through about the first quarter of it. After having completed Enescu's Fifth Symphony in 1995, Pascal Bentoiu undertook completion of the Fourth as well, and this version was premiered in Bucharest on 2 October 1997 by conducting the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra . The UK premiere was given in London on 29 April 2017 by Samuel Draper conducting the Oberon Symphony Orchestra . Analysis The symphony has three movements, which are played without pauses in between: *Allegro apassionato *Un poco andante, marziale *Allegro vivace ‚Äì non troppo The first movement is in sonata-allegro form, with the exposition presenting the exceptionally economical matter (only five or six melodic elements) that will account for virtually all of the music in the symphony. The main cyclic theme, which will recur in each movement at the same pitch and in the same instrument, first appears in the trumpet at rehearsal number 21. The development section is comparatively short, but this will be compensated by further extensive development in the finale. The recapitulation brings back the two main themes in reverse order. The second theme, originally presented in the solo flute, returns in a blaze of orchestral colour, while the first theme group is represented mainly by what was originally a bridge idea . This first movement, although completed by Enescu, cannot be regarded on its own, nor did the composer conceive it as such. Even in its unfinished form, the second movement (Un poco andante, marziale) follows without interruption and represents, in its thematic character, a continuation of the initial movement . The second movement develops further both of the theme groups from the first movement, in a march character that builds steadily to a climax at rehearsal number 49 and then subsides to a whisper in a solo string quartet, specified by the composer in the short-score sketch. The movement ends inconclusively, with a tremolo in the strings, cymbals, and harp that leads directly into the finale . The finale is difficult to assign to a definite form. Although there are passages with expository and developmental aspects, its overall function is the recapitulation of all the material from the previous two movements. After a certain point, Enescu turns his attention to breaking up the rhythms within the metre, first into twos, then fours, fives, nines, and tens, as well as superimposing them until finally the underlying ternary rhythm is broken and transformed into a binary metre .

H√§meensilta is one of the city's best known landmarks, especially famous for the statues on the rails of the bridge. The arches of the bridge are made of concrete and they are coated with a red granite. The H√§meensilta was completed in 1929. It is named after the Finnish name of the Tavastia province.  History  The first known bridge crossing the Tammerkoski was built in the 16th century as the area was a part of the Messukyl√§ socken. As the town of Tampere was established in 1779, the wooden bridge was finally replaced with a steel structured in 1884. During the early 1900s, Tampere was rapidly growing and the present H√§meensilta was built in 1928‚Äì1929. The 1900 completed Satakunnansilta is the other large bridge crossing Tammerkoski in the Tampere city center.

Early life Beryl Elizabeth King was born on 6 February 1902 in Gympie, Queensland, Australia, the eldest child of engine driver Walter Henry King and music teacher Alice Mary (n√©e Marshall). She attended the local school and relocated to Brisbane in 1920 to join the Queensland Public Service, working as private secretary to the under- secretaries of the Department of Labour Industry. Personal life and career King married solicitor Edward Francis Pender on 5 August 1939 at the All Saints Church in Wickham Terrace. She became secretary of the local chapter of the Australian Comforts Fund's Queensland division. In 1941, her husband enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force; a year later, King was appointed as the administrative officer of the Australian Women's Land Army (AWLA) in Queensland. The couple filed for divorce some five years later. The AWLA worked to mobilise female workers to replace male workers who had left to fight during the war. McLeish was instrumental in recruiting women, and in overcoming the skepticism of some farmers who were uneasy with having women replace their male workers.

As a three-year-old, he won the 142nd running of the New Zealand Derby, followed up by a win in the Rosehill Guineas in Australia. At age four, he won the Windsor Park Plate and was second in the Livamol Classic, but then was injured while warming up for the Emirates Stakes. The injury required surgery that eventually prompted his retirement. Background Gingernuts is a chestnut gelding who was bred by Goodwood Stud in Palmerston North. He was produced by Double Elle, a five-time winning daughter of Generous who descends on the female side from New Zealand Oaks winner Devante. Gingernuts was sired by Iffraaj, a stakes-winning son of Zafonic. He was sold as a weanling for only NZ$5000, then was put through the ring again in the 2015 Ready to Run Sale of two-year-olds. He was bought for NZ$42,500 by Te Akau Racing, a 35 member syndicate consisting of mostly first time owners. He is trained by Steven Autridge and Jamie Richards. Racing career Gingernuts made his debut on 6 May 2016 in a 1200m maiden race at Pukekohe Park, finishing second. He then broke his maiden on 19 May at Hastings over a distance of 1300m. Gingernuts began his three-year-old campaign on a low-key note, winning one of three starts while competing at rural tracks such as Te Teko. Early in 2017, his trainers added blinkers to his equipment, which helped him focus. On 18 February, he dramatically stepped up in class in class for the Group II Avondale Guineas at Ellerslie, going off at odds of 26-to-one. Gingernuts missed the start by six lengths and still appeared to have no chance with 600m remaining. However, he then found racing room and \\"sailed through\\" to win by a length. The win prompted his connections to make a late nomination payment for the New Zealand Derby. Gingernuts was the second favourite for the 2017 New Zealand Derby on 4 March. Ridden by Opie Bosson, who had previously won several major races aboard Mongolian Khan, the chestnut gelding surged out of midfield to score a comfortable victory. The win sparked jubilant scenes among the owners, most wearing matching orange caps. \\"We didn't know where we were before the Avondale Guineas\\", said Richards. \\"There's a lot of excited owners here.\\" Two weeks after his Derby win, Gingernuts crossed the Tasman to make his Australian debut in the Rosehill Guineas at a distance of 2000m. Over extremely heavy going, he settled in mid-pack, then unleashed his run with 800m remaining and struck the lead shortly after turning into the straight. He tired somewhat in the final 100m but was still over three lengths clear of the runner-up, Inference. \\"He just loves it the further they go and we knew he would handle the conditions,\\" said Richards. \\"He had his ears pricked all the way up the straight and he was gawking and looking around,\\" noted Bosson. \\"I was just trying to keep his mind on the job.\\" He finished his three-year-old campaign with a fifth place finish in the Australian Derby. Gingernuts returned to New Zealand and was given some time off, then began his four-year- old campaign on 2 September in the Tarzino Trophy, finishing fifth. He next entered the Windsor Park Plate on 23 September, in which his odds dropped rapidly to 2.90 thanks to his ever-growing fanbase. He raced in mid-pack during the early running then followed Kawi to the lead with about 600m remaining. Gingernuts dueled briefly with Kawi before pulling away, then withstood a late charge from Close Up to win by a neck. Two weeks later though, he was caught at the finish line by Wait A Sec in the Livamol Spring Classic, losing by a head. Gingernuts made his second trip to Australia for the Emirates Stakes on 11 November. Unfortunately, he took a bad step during the warm-up and was immediately pulled up by jockey Michael Dee. The on-track veterinarian immediately applied bandages and the horse was transported to the University of Melbourne veterinary clinic at Werribee. A CT scan found a fracture of the long pastern bone on his near foreleg. He underwent surgery on 13 November, during which four compression screws were inserted into the leg. A small fragment of bone was also removed from the fetlock joint. The initial prognosis was positive according to David Ellis of Te Akau Racing. \\"The fracture came together well,\\" he said, \\"and barring any further complications, the prognosis is that he stands a 50/50 chance for a return to racing.\\" Retirement On 2 September 2018, his connections announced that Gingernuts was officially retired. Although he recovered well from his injury, veterinarians feared that he would favour the injured leg if he returned to racing. He has been pensioned at Te Akau Stud.

Drafted in 1941 and partially orchestrated at some later date, the symphony was left unfinished at Enescu's death, but has been completed posthumously, first partially by in 1970‚Äì72 and 1990, then in complete form by Pascal Bentoiu in 1995. History Lumini»ô, Enescu's villa near Sinaia, where he composed the Fifth Symphony Although the ideas in it had doubtless been gestating for some time, Enescu began writing the Fifth Symphony during his annual summer break at his villa, Lumini»ô, in Sinaia in 1941, completing the entire draft in a span of something less than one month. The starting date is unknown, but Enescu might have been prompted to begin the symphony by the outbreak of war in Romania on 22 June. The first movement is dated 1 July in the manuscript and the second movement 8 July. The third movement is undated, but the fourth and final movement of the draft was completed on 19 July. For reasons that are not entirely clear, but must have had something to do with the war, Enescu broke off work at this point . At some later date (perhaps in Romania before September 1946, or later, in Paris), Enescu set about the orchestration, completing twenty-five pages (about two-thirds) of the first movement, up to a culminating chord in the fifth bar of the recapitulation . The first movement of the Symphony, in the completion by Cornel »öƒÉranu, was premiered at the Cluj Musical Autumn in 1972 under the baton of Emil Simon. Encouraged by its reception, »öƒÉranu set about the more difficult task of completing the rest . After finishing a piano-score version, he orchestrated the finale, which was first presented together with the first movement at the Enescu Festival of 1991 in Bucharest, performed by the George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra under . Although »öƒÉranu had hoped to complete the orchestration of the other two movements as well, he was prevented from doing so and asked Pascal Bentoiu to undertake the task. Realizing that the orchestrational integrity of the whole would otherwise suffer, Bentoiu (with »öƒÉranu's agreement) reworked the entire finale as well as the unfinished third of the first movement, and the completed symphony was finally premiered in Bucharest by the Romanian National Orchestra and Radio Choir, with Florin Diaconescu, tenor soloist, conducted by , on the opening concert of the 1996‚Äì97 season . Analysis The symphony has four movements: *Moderato sciolto *Andantino moderato piacevole *Vivace con fuoco *Andante grave The overall form of the symphony involves, typically for Enescu, a cyclical metamorphosis of thematic \\"characters\\", setting out from a definitively shaped but spontaneous block of sonorities . It involves a broadening of the concept of clyclic form, however, in that the allocation of roles for the various themes is constantly changing, in a sort of perpetual variational thinking. The main theme of the first movement, for example, will become a secondary theme in the finale. Similarly, the internal arrangement of elements within each theme group also changes with every recurrence . The first movement (Moderato sciolto) is written in a free sonata-allegro form . The first thematic group is striking for the breadth of its melodic content, which is not usual for any symphony, and is not found in Enescu's previous four essays in the form. Within the composer's catalogue, it is necessary to go back to the String Octet (1900) or the \\"Pr√©lude a l'unison\\" from the Second Orchestral Suite (1915) to find a comparable treatment. This theme group extends for twelve pages of orchestral score, up until the solo violin enters at rehearsal-number 7, marked dolente. At first this seems to be just a bridge, but proves to be the most important element of the second thematic group. This second group, in contrast to the first, presents a small number of well-defined motifs and phrases, and continues for only four pages of score, to the beginning of the development section at rehearsal number 11 . The treatment of the exposition materials is one of \\"characters in the making\\"‚Äîfigures and motives that will evolve over the remainder of the entire symphony . The tumultuous development section reaches its climax after five bars of the recapitulation are already under way. It is at this point that Enescu's completed orchestration ceases, and what follows is surpisingly compressed, reaching the second thematic group after only sixteen bars. The composer's intention seems to have been to create in the first movement only a summary of what is to follow in the rest of the symphony, with anticipations in place of the expected resolutions. The movement concludes with an announcement of a new theme, which will become the opening theme of the second movement, at exactly the same pitch‚Äîa device that Enescu used frequently, ever since the Octet and the First Orchestral Suite. He will do exactly the same thing at the junction of the third and fourth movements . The second movement (Andantino moderato piacevole) is in Enescu's mature rhapsodic style. It opens with a long viola solo, recalling the modal sound world of the composer's nearly contemporaneous Opp. 27 and 28: the Third Orchestral Suite (Villageoise) and the Impressions d'enfance for violin and piano. After a repetition by the oboe, accompanied by other woodwinds, the viola returns, accompanied in an improvisational, lƒÉutƒÉreascƒÉ style. (The scoring here is indicated scrupulously by the composer in the draft score.) The chromatic/neoromantic musical language gives way here to a fluid modal world that passes easily from one finalis to another, with accompanying pedals, shifting isons, quartal-quintal chords and secundal harmonies, as well as locally \\"displaced\\" chords . Structurally, the movement is extremely free, beginning with a series of thematic expositions in an A B A' B' C D sequence, then continuing from rehearsal 32 with only the material already presented up to that point. Although recapitulation is occasionally suggested, the only real recapitulation occurs with the return of the solo viola's unmistakably Romanian theme three bars after rehearsal number 46 . The third movement (Vivace con fuoco) is a scherzo, written in 2/2 time with an inner pulsation of triplets. The thematic material is drawn entirely from the first movement, especially from the second part of the first thematic group. After a dense opening passage, the texture gradually thins out, eventually giving way to a sort of chorale (taking the place of the conventional trio section), though with continuing bursts from the first theme. This central section closes in a \\"triumphal\\" quality, with suggestions of the secondary thematic group from the first movement. This scherzo is the only real allegro movement of the symphony and may be regarded as a redevelopment of the material from the first movement, along the lines of Arnold Schoenberg's procedure in his First Chamber Symphony . The movement is extremely modulatory. At rehearsal number 65, the theme from the first movement's second group, originally dolente in the solo violin, now enters forcefully, and the momentum is broken. Four bars after rehearsal 68, the movement closes with two statements of the subject that will launch the finale . The finale (Andante grave) is an extended cantata for tenor solo, female choir, and orchestra, using as text an early variant of the poem \\"Mai am un singur dor\\" (I Have but One Desire) by Mihai Eminescu. Its overall form, in outline, is : *Fugato ‚Äì stretto ‚Äì pedal *Recapitulative development of material from all the preceding movements *Cantata ‚Äì final coda The subject of the opening fugato is derived from that dolente theme from the solo violin in the first movement. Here it is assigned (by the composer himself in the sketch) to the brass. The effect is funereal (in his edition, Bentoiu has taken the liberty of adding to the tempo marking, in brackets, \\"Quasi marcia funebre\\"), implacable, rigid, and magnificent. The section comes to an end with the main theme from the second movement, \\"almost as if we were invited to read a name on a wooden cross\\" . Text Mihai Eminescu in 1884 The text used in the last movement of the symphony does not quite correspond to any of the four \\"official\\" versions of Eminescu's poem, but is based on an early variant beginning with the words \\"De-oi adormi cur√¢nd / √én noaptea uitƒÉrii / SƒÉ mƒÉ duce≈£i tƒÉc√¢nd, / La marginea mƒÉrii\\" (When soon I'm laid to rest / in the quiet evening / bring me silently / to the seashore). Eminescu's variant has nine stanzas, but for the symphony, Enescu has added an extra one in the penultimate position. It is taken from the final version, but with the last two lines exchanged in order to match the abab rhyme scheme of the earlier variant: \\"Luceferi ce rƒÉsar / Din umbrƒÉ de cetini / O sƒÉ-mi z√¢mbeascƒÉ iar / Fiindu-mi prieteni\\" (Rising evening stars / from the shadow of the branches / will smile on me again / having been my friends) (; ).

Taxonomy and systematics The broad-billed roller was originally described in the genus Coracias. Formerly, some authorities have considered the broad-billed roller to have been a subspecies of the oriental dollarbird. Alternate names for the broad-billed roller include the African broad-billed roller and cinnamon roller. =Subspecies= Four subspecies are recognized: * E. g. aethiopicus Neumann, 1905, the Nile Valley broad-billed roller or Abyssinian broad-billed roller is found in Ethiopia * E. g. afer (Latham, 1790), originally described as a separate species in the genus Coracias, is found from Senegambia to northern Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan * E. g. suahelicus Neumann, 1905, the East African broad- billed roller, is found in from Somalia to Uganda, northern Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and north-eastern South Africa * E. g. glaucurus (Statius Muller, 1776), the Madagascar roller or Madagascar broad-billed roller, breeds in Madagascar but ranges to mainland Africa in winter Description The broad- billed roller is 29‚Äì30 cm in length. It has a warm back and head, lilac foreneck and breast, with the rest of the plumage mainly brown. The broad bill is bright yellow. Sexes are similar, but the juvenile is a drabber version of the adult, with a pale breast. The broad-billed roller is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings and tail contrasting with the brown back. The call of the broad-billed roller is a snarling k-k-k-k-k-r-r-r-r-r sound. Distribution and habitat This is a species of open woodland with some tall trees, preferably near water. These rollers often perch prominently on trees, posts or overhead wires, like giant shrikes. Behaviour and ecology They are inactive for most of the day, apart from chasing intruders, but in late afternoon they hunt for the swarming ants and termites on which they feed, sometimes in groups of 100 or more rollers. They drink like swallows, dipping their bills into water in flight. This bird nests in an unlined hole in a tree cavity, laying 2-3 eggs.

The Phoenix was founded by impresario Norris Houghton and T. Edward Hambleton. The project was a pioneering effort in the establishment of off-Broadway theatre. Houghton and Hambleton wanted a theatre away from Times Square, that would host a permanent company, abjure the star system (players would be listed alphabetically), produce four or five plays a season for limited engagements (contributors would be asked to sponsor an entire season rather than individual productions), and with ticket prices much lower than on Broadway. This building housed the Phoenix Theatre, 1953‚Äì1961 The Phoenix Theatre was established in a building at East 12th Street and Second Avenue in the East Village, far from Broadway. The building, opened in 1926, had formerly housed the Yiddish Art Theatre, and is now the Village East Cinema. The Phoenix opened on December 1, 1953, with a production of Madam Will You Walk?, Sidney Howard's last play, starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, followed by productions of Coriolanus and The Golden Apple (which then moved to Broadway, at the Alvin Theater). The opening season concluded with The Seagull, starring Montgomery Clift, and directed by Houghton himself. The Phoenix Theatre's opening season was judged successful. In the following seasons the theater mounted many more productions featuring notable figures of the theatre, and garnered various awards. Associated persons included British actors Pamela Brown, Michael and Rachel Redgrave, Peggy Ashcroft; American stars Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Millie Natwick, Mildred Dunnock, Robert Ryan, Montgomery Clift, and Kaye Ballard; and directors and producers Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Robert Whitehead, and Alfred de Liagre; and writers and designers Sidney Howard, Robert Sherwood, John Latouche, Jerome Moross, Donald Oenslager, and Jean Eckart. Productions mounted over the span of the Phoenix Theatre's existence include The Doctor's Dilemma (George Bernard Shaw), The Master Builder (Henrik Ibsen), Story of a Soldier (music drama, Igor Stravinsky), Six Characters in Search of an Author (Luigi Pirandello), The Mother of Us All (opera, Virgil Thomson and Gertrude Stein), Measure for Measure (William Shakespeare), Livin' the Life (musical based on Mark Twain's Mississippi River tales), The Good Woman of Szechuan (Bertolt Brecht), The Taming of the Shrew (William Shakespeare), and Anna Christie (Eugene O'Neill). Houghton, frustrated by the role of theatrical producer because it precluded him from directing, left the Phoenix to become a professor at Vassar College, beginning in 1959 and completely disengaging from the Phoenix within a few years. T. Edward Hambleton continued to run the Phoenix for the remainder of its existence. In 1961 the Phoenix, financially troubled, moved to a new and smaller house (300 seats) at 334 East 74th Street and ceased being a repertory company. The first production at the new site was Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad. But two years later the Phoenix merged with Ellis Rabb's company, the Association of Producing Artists (APA), and again took up being a repertory company. The company was then called the APA-Phoenix Theatre (or APA-Phoenix Repertory Company). In 1966, the APA- Phoenix moved to the Lyceum Theatre, in the heart of the Broadway district near Times Square, and remained there until 1969. In 1969 the association with the APA ended, and the Phoenix became peripatetic, staging shows at various venues including the ANTA Washington Square Theatre, the Sheridan Square Playhouse, the 48th Street Playhouse, the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, and the Marymount Manhattan Theatre. In 1972, the Phoenix Theatre In 1982, the Phoenix Theatre moved to a new home in the basement theatre at St. Peter's Evangelical Lutheran Church, which sits under the Citigroup Center at 619 Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. The opening production was Michael Hastings' Two Fish in the Sky. The Phoenix Theatre celebrated its new home, its new season, and its 30th anniversary with a gala soir√©e. But Two Fish in the Sky was panned and flopped, and hoped-for corporate support was not forthcoming. Citing insuperable financial challenges, the Phoenix announced on December 13, 1982, that it was ceasing operations. That venue is used since 1993 by York Theatre.

The plot of the game is that the boss of the new virtual reality video game \\"Wild Side\\" begins abducting players and the main character, Casey, goes to beat it and rescue them. He does this by using masks to shapeshift into different characters in order to use different abilities. It was later released in Japan as . After its initial release in 1992 for the Genesis, it was later re-released a number of times in the 2000s, including part of the Sega Smash Pack 2 for the PC in 2000, the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2 in 2006, as a digital release on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in 2009 and for the Sega Forever service in 2017. Gameplay The player, as Kid Chameleon, progresses through a series of levels, containing an array of deadly enemies and obstacles. Most levels contain a flag, which is the primary goal of each level, from which the player progresses to the next level. However, a number of teleporters throughout the game can warp the player not only to different places in the same level, but also to different levels, and sometimes to an entirely different path through the game. At the end of the game, Kid fights and defeats the final boss, Heady Metal. Kid Chameleon contains 103 levels, of which only about half are on the \\"main path\\" (traversing levels only by flags), and also counts 32 smaller unnamed levels, simply called \\"Elsewhere\\". Despite the game's considerable length, there was no password system or other method of saving the game (although re-releases in compilations and the Virtual Console include their own save features). There are several bonuses that can be earned at the end of certain levels (in which the flag is touched), including beating a time limit, not getting hit and not collecting any prizes. As Kid Chameleon moves through the game's levels, he gains access to masks that alter him into different characters. Each character has different special abilities and varying numbers of hit points. Collecting a mask that the player is already wearing will restore its health. The sheer amount of variety in gameplay due to the various characters is part of what gave Kid Chameleon such an addictive style; few levels repeated the same structure and they usually had specific strategies and characters to be beaten. In addition to the offensive abilities of each form, the Kid could also defeat enemies by jumping on them, although he may take damage from some enemies by doing so. Each form can also make use of Diamond Powers which require diamonds collected in the game to use, accessed by pressing A + Start. Players lose a life if Kid Chameleon loses all his hit points in human form, is crushed, falls into bottomless pits or lava, touches the drill wall which appears in certain levels, or if time runs out. Extra lives and continues can be found in the game, with additional lives awarded for every 50,000 points.

He took part in the Fourth Crusade (1202‚Äì04) and in the founding of the Latin Empire. A younger son of Garnier I, lord of Pont- sur-Seine and Tra√Ænel, Garnier was very old when he became a bishop. His uncle, Philippe de Pont, had previously been bishop of Troyes from 1083 to 1121, and his older brother, Ponce II, is recorded in a document from 1104. First pilgrimage In 1197, Garnier set out to visit the Holy Land in fulfillment of a vow. One of the purposes of his journey was to settle some disputes troubling the church of Troyes through the intervention of Count Henry II of Champagne, then ruling the Kingdom of Jerusalem in right of his wife, Queen Isabella I. He got only so far as Piacenza when news reached him of the death of Henry on 10 September. In light of his vow he continued his journey into Tuscany, but there was met by some friends returning from the Holy Land, who informed him that the French were all leaving and that Jerusalem was dominated by the Germans who had just come over. After receiving permission from Pope Innocent III to fulfill his vow with a cash payment for the defence of the Holy Land, Garnier returned to Champagne. In a surviving letter, Innocent praises Garnier for his undertaking in light of his age: \\"Not the disadvantage of imminent old age, nor the danger of the route, neither the doubtful fealty and constant inconstancy of the sea have deterred [you].\\" Fourth Crusade Garnier took a second vow to go to the Holy Land in 1199. He was with the crusader army that massed in Venice in 1202, and he accompanied it to the Siege of Zara (1202), thence to Corfu (1203) and finally the Sack of Constantinople (1204). He and the other clergy functioned as the conscience of the army, and they absolved the crusaders of wrongdoing for the sieges of Zara and Constantinople. Geoffrey of Villehardouin explicitly names the bishop of Troyes (li vesque de Troie) as among the clergy declaring the war to be just and right (droituriere). Garnier appears to have been among the most trusted men in the crusader army. Early in 1204, Henry of Flanders defeated the Emperor Alexios V Mourtzouphlos in battle and captured an important icon that the imperial forces had been carrying. He gave the icon to Garnier for safekeeping. Likewise, after the fall of Constantinople, the numerous icons and relics plundered from the city's churches were given to Garnier on the order of the Papal legate, Peter of Capua, pending a final division of the booty. He refused to release the head of Saint Mammes to the priest Walon de Dampierre, who only obtained it from the legate after Garnier's death. Garnier was one of the six ecclesiastical electors who, together with six Venetian electors, chose the new emperor, Baldwin I, on 9 May 1204. During the coronation festivities on 17 May, Garnier and the bishops of Soissons, Halberstadt and Bethlehem blessed the crown and placed it on Baldwin's head, then led him to the throne. In a church dedicated to Saint Victor by the Golden Gate, Garnier discovered a relic of the head of the saint. At the request of his own chaplain, Peter, he had the head sent back to Pierre de Corbeil, archbishop of Sens and his superior. The archbishop in turn gifted the relic to the Canons Regular of Saint Victor in Paris. Garnier died on 14 April 1205 in Constantinople and was buried there. On that same day, the crusaders suffered a major defeat at Adrianople against the Bulgarians.

Its full name is the Jan Shrem and Maria Manetti Shrem Museum of Art. The museum opened on November 13, 2016. According to the New York Times, the museum includes \\"trailblazing contributions by the school‚Äôs renowned art faculty, which contributed to innovations in conceptual, performance and video art in the 1960s and 70s\\". Background Richard L. Nelson was the founder of the art department at UC Davis, and he recruited a faculty in the early 1960s that included highly successful artists such as Wayne Thiebaud, Robert Arneson, Roy De Forest, Manuel Neri, Roland Petersen and William T. Wiley. Several were associated with the Funk art genre. In a negative 1981 review in the New York Times, conservative art critic Hilton Kramer referred to Arneson as the leader of \\"a spirit best defined as defiant provincialism\\" at UC Davis. That phrase has since been embraced as a defining description by artists associated with UC Davis. For nearly 60 years, the art faculty hoped for and discussed the possibility of building a dedicated art museum, according to museum director Rachel Teagle. Financing Margrit Mondavi, widow of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi, made an initial $2 million donation to begin the project. Napa Valley winemaker Jan Shrem, founder of Clos Pegase winery, and his wife Maria Manetti Shrem, donated $10 million of the $30 million budget for building the museum. Design The architects were Florian Idenburg and Jing Liu of the firm SO-IL of Brooklyn, who partnered with local architect Bohlin Cywinski Jackson. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne described the building: \\"Inside, a lobby with lightly polished concrete floors is lined with a sweeping curve of floor-to-ceiling glass. As you enter, a multipurpose room that can be arranged as an auditorium is off to the left, with classrooms, studios and museum offices straight ahead. To the right are the galleries, which fill rooms of varying sizes and heights and are topped with a ceiling of aluminum mesh, through which mechanical equipment is left visible.\\" A \\"focal point\\" of the design is the Grand Canopy, a structure of swooping curves that surrounds the museum. Described as a \\"perforated aluminum and steel roof that creates textured light and shadows throughout the grounds\\", it was inspired by the geometry of the farm fields that surround Davis. According to acting university chancellor Ralph Hexter, \\"Students, faculty, staff and the public all will be able to enjoy our rich art legacy and history at UC Davis in a gorgeous and inviting building at the gateway to our campus. Our new museum stresses education first and foremost, with classrooms, a working studio for students and other resources near the entrance where all can see and enjoy for generations to come.\\" Collection The museum owns nearly 6,000 art objects, including many works by Bruce Nauman, a 1966 MFA graduate of the university. Wayne Thiebaud has donated 72 of his own works and 300 works by other artists to the museum's permanent collection. In addition to his financial support, Jan Shrem has also donated works of art including sculptures from his collection to the museum's collection.

The mountain is part of the Methow Mountains in the Cascade Range. Big Kangaroo is the high point of Kangaroo Ridge which is about two miles east and within view of Washington Pass. Its nearest higher peak is Snagtooth Ridge, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Early Winters Creek which is a tributary of the Methow River. Climate Big Kangaroo is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation.

The conservation park occupies land in the cadastral units of the Hundreds of Barwell, Blesing, Cowan and Kappawanta located to the immediate west of the Tod Highway and to the immediate south of the Birdseye Highway. Land within the extent of the conservation park as of 2017 first obtained protected area status as the Bascombe Well National Park on 2 July 1970 under the National Parks and Wildlife Reserves Act 1891-1960 In 1972, it was constituted as a conservation park upon the proclamation of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 27 April 1972. Additions of land to the conservation park in the Hundred of Cowan during 1979 and in both the Hundreds of Blesing and Cowan during 1980. Crown land located in the hundreds of Blesing and Cowan which had been previously dedicated as a conservation reserve known as the Bascombe Well Conservation Reserve under the Crown Lands Act 1929 in 1993 was added to the conservation park on 22 March 2007. The name is derived from Bascombe Well, a feature located within its boundaries. The land previously part of the Bascombe Well Conservation Reserve is subject to access under the Mining Act 1971. The land on which the conservation park is located was used for at least a century for pastoral purposes firstly by Price Maurice following by others until 1967 when the lease was resumed by the Government of South Australia. The previous use is evident by the remains of buildings and stone fences throughout the conservation park. As of 2007, the conservation park was reported to support the following species of flora: # Tree communities observed included ‚Äúmallee communities‚Äù dominated by Coastal White Mallee and Mallee Box along with ‚Äúoccasional Red Gum woodlands‚Äù which are believed to be supported by ‚Äúsmall groundwater lenses‚Äù, which are present at a shallow depth. #14 plant species of conservation significance have been recorded included West Coast mintbush, limestone leek-orchid and Thysanotus nudicaulis. #Introduced weed species such as bridal creeper, boxthorn and horehound. As of 2007, the conservation park was reported to support the following species of fauna: # Twelve species of mammal have been recorded of which seven of which are indigenous ‚Äúincluding three species of bat.‚Äù The discovery of the grey- bellied dunnart both in the conservation park and the Hincks Wilderness Protection Area during December 2004 represented ‚Äúa significant range extension from Western Australia‚Äù where the species had previously been observed. Introduced species observed include the European rabbit, the red fox, the feral cat and the house mouse. # 85 species of bird have been recorded of which 84 are indigenous including the following species of conservation significance at both state and national level - blue-breasted fairywren, chestnut quail-thrush, malleefowl, painted buttonquail and shining bronze cuckoo. The sole recorded introduced species is the common starling. #Twenty-two species of reptile and one species of amphibian were recorded including the following species of conservation significance at state level - the jacky lizard and the Dwarf Four-toed Slider. The sole species of amphibian is the trilling frog. As of 2007, visitor numbers were reported as being ‚Äúlow‚Äù and that the ‚Äúmain recreational pursuit‚Äù was ‚Äúpicnicking, which is undertaken at the ruins.‚Äù Also, access to and travel within the conservation park was via tracks suitable only for four-wheel drive vehicles and that no visitor facilities had been provided on the assumption that visitors will be ‚Äúself- reliant.‚Äù The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

At the establishment of the WA parliament in 1897, Ministerialists were defined as those who supported the government of the day (led by John Forrest), while Oppositionists were opposed to it. Multiple candidates for each grouping could run for a given seat. The Australian Labour Party (ALP) was the only major grouping outside this structure. Additionally, some candidates ran as an \\"Independent\\". At the 1901 WA election, the Ministerialists (aligned with Forrest) lost to the Oppositionists (lead by George Leake). However, the labels stuck to the groupings, and the \\"Oppositionists\\" now had power and the ministries. This strange use of nomenclature ceased with the defeat of the Oppositionists by the Ministerialists at the 1904 election. Around this point, the term \\"Oppositionist\\" ceased to be used. The Ministerialists were then to retain power until their defeat by the ALP at the 1911 election. Immediately after this, the Ministerialist grouping became the centre-right Western Australian Liberal Party (1911‚Äì17) under the continued guidance of John Forrest.Note at the end of the speech build up a good patriotic Liberal Party In the 1920s, the centre-right Nationalist party (heirs to the Liberal Party) retained the practice of allowing multiple party candidates to compete against each other in a single member seat.

Exterior The Renault Trezor with its roof open Renault Trezor rear The car is unique due to its lack of lines across the body with the only visible seam occurring where the roof connects to the lower portion of the car. The main reason for the lack of visible seams is its clamshell style roof which opens up to allow passengers to enter the interior. The single piece canopy opens by hinging forward on struts. The car also uses a carbon-fiber chassis and a wooden frame under the bonnet, which was built with French bicycle manufacturer KEIM, to function as a luggage rack. It had to carry on the legacy of the DeZir, extreme beauty and economy while sacrificing top speed. The car has a drag coefficient of 0.22 which makes it one of the most aerodynamically efficient cars in the world. The exterior lighting signature of the car changes when switched to autonomous mode. The car rides on 21 inch front and 22 inch rear wheels with gaps between spokes in the shape of the Eiffel Tower, besides carbon-fiber scoops to aid in brake cooling. There are no doors, instead you open the roof and climb out. Interior The car has an electric motor developing and torque, allowing the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in less than four seconds. The car has two battery packs with independent cooling systems optimized by variable geometry honeycomb shaped air intakes in front. The car has a brake operated energy recovery system, developed from the Rechargeable Energy Storage System (RESS) technology developed for Formula E cars. The interior and the windshield of the car are colored red. The car also has an OLED touchscreen covered with Gorilla Glass on both the center console and steering wheel.

The 1910 building is now a City of Houston historic landmark and is owned by the city government. History It first opened in 1902 as the Kirby School. A man named Rufus Cage donated the land which housed the school. It moved into another building, across from the original, in 1906.\\"Elementary Schools (A-J).\\" Houston Independent School District. Retrieved on March 5, 2017. In 1910 a new building opened on that site. The building, designed by Jones and Tabor company, was designed more like a school in a city than one in a rural area. The school was originally owned by Harris County, but in 1914 the City of Houston took control. Initially the Houston school district closed Kirby School and redirected all students to Eastwood Elementary (now Lantrip Elementary School), but area parents complained. The Kirby building was repurposed into an apartment complex, and the tenants kept cattle there. The school reopened after 11 years of apartment usage. In 1923 Cage died, and the school, which reopened in 1925, was now Cage Elementary School. Food was cooked using a kerosene stove provided by the Cage Elementary mothers' association since initially the school was not supplied with cooking equipment nor water. A cafeteria and an addition were installed in the 1940s. In the 1950s the school had 251 students. The parents opposed closure requests during that decade; the parent-teacher organization of Cage at the time had 314 persons on its membership roster. Cage was previously reserved for white children (Hispanics being categorized as white prior to 1970Kellar, William Henry.

At a later point a storm damaged the roof. In 2011 HISD put Cage up for sale, stating that it needed to ensure its budget would remain balanced. Area residents were concerned that HISD could sell it to a party that would demolish the building. - Alternate link at the Eastwood Civic Association In October 2011 several area residents asked HISD to sell the former Cage school to the City of Houston. The City of Houston offered to buy the old Cage in exchange for a right-of-way purchase credit of $100,000. HISD accepted the offer. In 2012 the City of Houston designated Cage a protected historic landmark. Activist Lenwood Johnson, known for his advocacy for the Fourth Ward, criticized Mayor of Houston Annise Parker for seeking to preserve the original Cage Elementary while not doing enough to preserve the Fourth Ward. Operations Circa 1996 the school allowed fifth graders with academic success to move on to Jackson Middle School (now Yolanda Navarro Middle School) in the sixth grade, while it had an in-house sixth grade program for students who previously faced academic and/or maturity issues. Curriculum The current Cage Elementary School campus also houses the Project Chrysalis middle school program By 2005 the school implemented \\"Reading Buddies\\", a program in which students of higher grade levels read books to students of lower grade levels.

The Department of Public Works and Highways plans of a road widening project which would affect a portion of the cemetery's perimeter received nationwide attention in May 2015 but no part of the cemetery's walls was demolished following an appeal by local officials to the transportation department. A pit was dug inside the structure of the cemetery's Spanish Baroque mortuary chapel by treasure hunters compromising the integrity of the structure. The digging of the pit reportedly had the authorization of the parish priest of San Joaquin and was commenced as early as December 2015. The parish priest who took a leave of absence was replaced by the Jaro Archdiocese. A restoration effort was finished by November 2016 which saw the filling of the pit of a proper mixture of soil, rocks and cement initiated by the Archdiocese of Jaro through the assigned Parish Administrator delegated by the Archbishop.

It dates back to the early 16th century and originally served as headquarters and shooting range of the local schutterij (civic guard). Most of the current building at Singel 421 dates to the 18th century and is part of the main complex of the Amsterdam University Library. The Doelenzaal hall on the ground floor of the building (not to be confused with the Doelenzaal on Kloveniersburgwal canal) is used for lectures, meetings, receptions and doctoral dissertations. The building has rijksmonument status.\\"Singel 421, Amsterdam\\", Monumenten.nl (Dutch, archived)  History  = Shooting range = The Handboogdoelen, also known as the Garnalendoelen, Grote Doelen or St. Sebastiaansdoelen (after the patron saint of archers, Saint Sebastian) was one of three doelens (shooting ranges) for the Amsterdam schutterij (civic guard). The other two shooting ranges were the Voetboogdoelen and Kloveniersdoelen, located along the Singel and Kloveniersburgwal canals respectively. The Handboogdoelen civic guard was armed with longbows, while the Voetboogdoelen civic guard wielded crossbows and the Kloveniersdoelen civic guard used an early type of musket, the arquebus. The headquarters of the Handboogdoelen was the largest and grandest of the three.H. de la Fontaine Verwey, \\"Herinneringen van een bibliothecaris'\\", De boekenwereld, Jaargang 3. Uitgeverij Matrijs, Utrecht, 1986-1987 (Dutch, archived) The Handboogdoelen was established shortly before 1500 as the shooting range for the handboogschutterij (longbowmen's civic guard), and the associated building was completed around 1512. Like the adjacent Voetboogdoelen (established in 1458), the shooting range extended from the Singel canal to the back side of the houses on Kalverstraat.\\"Voormalige St. Sebastiaans- of Handboogdoelen met voorgevel in Amsterdam\\", Rijksmonumenten.nl (Dutch, archived)\\"Heiligeweg 32\\", Amsterdam Archeologische Rapporten, Gemeente Amsterdam Bureau Monumenten & Archeologie, 2013 (Dutch) Amsterdam's militia guilds were formed in the Middle Ages to defend the city against attack. Around 1580, at the behest of William of Orange, these Medieval guilds were incorporated into a new, much larger civic guard to defend the newly Protestant city against the Spanish during the Dutch revolt which ultimately led to a full-blown war of independence, the Eighty Years' War. Officers of this new civic guard were recruited from the well-to- do of Amsterdam.\\"The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw, Cornelis Ketel, 1588\\", Rijksmuseum (archived) The Handboogdoelen was used by the civic guard from about 1509. In 1533, two bay windows were added to the building, the first known examples of bay windows in Amsterdam.Theo Rouwhorst, \\"Erkers\\", Binnenstad 223/224, Oct. 2007 (Dutch, archived) The shooting range lay behind the building, stretching north towards the Kalverstraat. A small gate provided access to the shooting range. This gate, dating to about 1650, is still in existence and is now located on Handboogstraat, a small street running behind the building. The gate features Doric columns and depicts bows and arrows and quivers. In the mid-17th century, the Eighty Years' War ended and the civic guard no longer served a military purpose. The civic guard continued to exist, but membership became an honorary position and the doelens assumed a primarily social function. The wealthiest and most powerful citizens of Dutch Golden Age Amsterdam came together in the doelens to eat, drink and smoke. In 1650 the city gave permission for houses to be built on the former shooting ranges of the Hand- and Voetboogdoelen. For these houses, two new streets were constructed: the Handboogstraat and Voetboogstraat. =Inn and hotel= In the 17th century, the building was also in use as lodgings for prominent visitors to Amsterdam. Its role as shooting range and headquarters of the civic guard ended in 1672, when the building was rented out to an innkeeper. In the late 17th century, the inn was expanded with additional rooms and halls by adding another floor to the building and connecting it to the adjacent house. A new facade was added to the building in 1733, depicting the coat of arms of the city of Amsterdam at the top, as well as five smaller coats of arms between the windows below: the coat of arms of the civic guard and those of four overlieden (directors) of the civic guard, including Frans Banning Cocq, who features as the central figure in Rembrandt's The Night Watch. The building served as a meeting place for the radical political faction of the Patriotten in the late 18th century. For instance, a large feast was held in the banqueting hall in 1786 to celebrate a Dutch alliance with France. In the 19th century, the inn transformed into a well-respected hotel, known as Hotel de Garnalen Doelen. =University library= In 1860, the city of Amsterdam offered the building to the Athenaeum Illustre, the predecessor of the University of Amsterdam. The city library, predecessor of the Amsterdam University Library, moved there around 1881 from the Agnietenkapel, as this chapel had become to small and derelict to house the library. The Handboogdoelen remains part of the main university library complex to this day. In the 20th century, the adjacent buildings were added to the library complex. Physicist Johannes Diderik van der Waals established his first laboratory in the building. He remained there until about 1883, when his laboratory was moved to a new building on Plantage Muidergracht canal.A.J. Kox,\\"Honderdvijfentwintig jaar theoretische natuurkunde in Amsterdam\\", University of Amsterdam (Dutch, archived) A 1968 restoration uncovered the original 16th-century building, revealing that it may contain the city's oldest remaining masonry work and the only remaining late-Medieval mantelpiece.  Painting  Members of the civic guard, drawn from the well- to-do of Amsterdam, frequently commissioned group portraits of themselves, which were hung in the doelens. For instance, Jan Tengnagel in 1613 painted a rot (section) of 17 members of the handboogschutterij (longbowmens' civic guard) under the command of Geurt van Beuningen. This painting is now in the Rijksmuseum. Around 1653, Bartholomeus van der Helst portraited the overlieden (directors) of the longbowmens' civic guard. This painting is now in the Louvre in Paris. Jan Weenix painted a wall covering for the Handboogdoelen depicting a hunting scene. The painting is now on display in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague. Rembrandt sketched the front facade of the Handboogdoelen.

The Dutch towns of Middelburg and Goes also had a Handboogdoelen for their civic guards of longbowmen.

All 12 crew were killed. (Joe Baugher cites the date as 5 May 1943, but this is incorrect.) Approaching the airport from the southwest in light rain, light fog and light smoke, with a 500-foot ceiling and .75 miles visibility, the bomber circled the field to the north and east, and was on a southern heading when it struck the approximately tank at the 125-foot level, initially with the left wingtip. Much of the forward fuselage fell inside the tank structure which exploded, throwing steel plate over with heat felt over a mile away. Nine employees were on the grounds but none were injured.

It is a melodrama based on a French dramatization of the 1844 novella by Alexandre Dumas. Background From 1850 Dion Boucicault was employed by the actor Charles Kean, who leased the Princess's Theatre, London, as the house dramatist. Boucicault, fluent in French, travelled to France to find plays he could adapt for the English stage; a result of this was The Corsican Brothers, adapted from the 1850 play Les Freres corses by Eug√®ne Grang√© and Xavier de Mont√©pin.Geraint D'Arcy.

Cambridge University Press Archive, 1984.Page 6Les Freres corses, The Corsican Brothers University of Kent Special Collections, accessed 4 March 2017. The play, directed by Charles Kean, opened at the Princess's Theatre on 24 February 1852. Charles Kean played both of the brothers Fabien dei Franchi and Louis dei Franchi, and Alfred Wigan played Chateau- Renaud.Taylor, George. Players and performances in the Victorian Theatre. Manchester University Press, 1989. Page 23. Synopsis Act I and Act II are understood as taking place at the same time. Each of the brothers Fabien dei Franchi and Louis dei Franchi are able to sense if the other is in danger. Act I At his home in a castle in Corsica, Fabien dei Franchi becomes aware that his brother Louis, in Paris, is in danger. At the end of the act, after making peace between feuding local families, he has a vision of Louis' death in a duel. Act II The events leading to the duel are described. Louis has travelled to Paris to find Emilie de L'Esparre, with whom he has fallen in love. She has married, and he vows to accept the situation; her husband admires Louis' honesty in admitting the past affair, and asks him to protect her while he is away. Chateau-Renaud, known as a womanizer and duellist, is pursuing Madame L'Esparre, and he challenges Louis to a duel. In the Forest of Fontainebleau, Louis is wounded in the ensuing sword fight; before he dies he tells his second that his brother will avenge his death. Act III Chateau-Renaud, with his friend and second Baron de Montgiron, try to flee the country, but their carriage crashes in the same clearing in the forest. Fabien dei Franchi appears: they think it is the ghost of Louis until he introduces himself. After a long sword fight, Chateau-Renaud is killed. At the end, the ghost of Louis appears once more. Critical reception George Henry Lewes wrote: \\"Charles Kean... seems now... settling down into the conviction that his talent does not lie in any Shakespearian sphere whatever, but in melodrames.... Charles Kean plays the two brothers; and you must see him before you will believe how well and quietly he plays them; preserving a gentlemany demeanour, a drawingroom manner very difficult to assume on the stage, if one may judge from its rarity, which intensifies the passion of the part, and gives it a terrible reality.... The duel between him and Wigan was a masterpiece on both sides; the Bois de Boulogne itself has scarcely seen a duel more real or more exciting....\\"The Leader, 28 February 1852. Quoted in: Taylor, George. Players and performances in the Victorian Theatre. Manchester University Press, 1989. Pages 27‚Äì28. A special sort of trap door, afterwards known as a Corsican trap, glide trap or ghost glide, was made for the play. It gave the impression of a ghost gliding across the stage as it rose up through the floor. It was an important part of the play's success, and was installed in theatres where the play was produced.Trap Doors On Stage Theatrecrafts.com, accessed 4 March 2017. \\"First the head was seen, and then, as it slowly ascended higher and higher, the figure advanced, increasing in stature as it neared him, and the profound silence of the audience denoted how wrapt was their attention. Melodramatic effect was never more perfectly produced\\".The Era, 29 February 1852. Quoted in: Geraint D'Arcy. The Corsican Trap: Its Mechanism and Reception Questia Online Library, accessed 4 March 2017. The play was very successful: it soon ran at other London theatres, and in the following months it opened at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh and at the Queen's Royal Theatre in Dublin. At the Princess's Theatre it had 236 performances during Kean's eight-year tenancy. Queen Victoria saw the play several times, and Prince Albert commissioned Edward Henry Corbould to paint a scene from the play.

The elements of this class are found in all animals, including humans. They can also be found in protists and bacteria. The class is named after its two best-studied members, the Tc1 transposon of Caenorhabditis elegans and the mariner transposon of Drosophila.  Structure  thumbupright=1.4A. Structure of DNA transposons (Mariner type). B. Mechanism of transposition The transposon consists of a transposase gene, flanked by two terminal inverted repeats (TIR). Two short tandem site duplications (TSD) are present on both sides of the insert. Transposition happens when two transposases recognize and bind to TIR sequences, join together and promote DNA double-strand cleavage. The DNA-transposase complex then inserts its DNA cargo at specific DNA motifs elsewhere in the genome, creating short TSDs upon integration. In the IS630/Tc1/mariner system, the motif used is a \\"TA\\" dinucleotide, duplicated on both ends after insertion. When the transposase gene is not carried by the transposon, it becomes a non-autonomous in that it now requires the gene to be expressed elsewhere to move around. = Transposase = Structural features of SB transposase. The 360-amino acid polypeptide has three major subdomains: the amino-terminal DNA-recognition domain that is responsible for binding to the DR sequences in the mirrored IR/DR sequences of the transposon, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), and a DDE domain that catalyzes the cut-and-paste set of reactions that comprise transposition. The DNA-recognition domain has two paired box sequences that can bind to DNA and are related to various motifs found on some transcription factors; the two paired boxes are labeled PAI and RED, both having the helix- turn-helix motif common for DNA-binding domains. The catalytic domain has the hallmark DDE (sometimes DDD) amino acids that are found in many transposase and recombinase enzymes. In addition, there is a region that is highly enriched in glycine (G) amino acids. Several signatures for the superfamily of transcriptases have been given in various domain databases given the multi- domain nature of the protein. In addition, each domain are often represented by multiple entries, such as // among others for the \\"PAI\\" half of the box. The RED box is similarly dive rse (//, etc.) and is often in a winged HTH form for DNA recognition.  Sub-groups  The Tc1/mariner superfamily is generally subdivided by the catalytic domains of its transposase. It generally use a DDE (Asp-Asp-Glu) or DDD catalytic triad. = Tc1 = Tc1 (DD34E) is a transposon active in Caenorhabditis elegans. There are also Tc1-like transposons in humans, all inactive. Tc1-like elements are present in other lower vertebrates, including several fish species and amphibians. In C. elegans, it is a 1610 base-pair long sequence. Experiments show that this element \\"jumps\\" in human cells, with its transposase as the only protein required. Another example of this family is Tc3, also a transposon found in C. elegans. = Mariner = Mariner (DD34D) elements are found in multiple species, including humans. The Mariner transposon was first discovered by Jacobson and Hartl in Drosophila in 1986. A classification of the group was published in 1993, which divided such sequences in insects into the mauritiana, cecropia, mellifera, irritans, and capitata subfamilies, after the types of insects they are found in. The classification does extend to other species. This transposable element is known for its uncanny ability to be transmitted horizontally in many species. There are an estimated 14,000 copies of Mariner in the human genome comprising 2.6 million base pairs. The first mariner-element transposons outside of animals were found in Trichomonas vaginalis. Human Mariner-like transposons are divided into Hsmar1 (cecropia) and Hsmar2 (irritans) subfamilies. Although both types are inactive, one copy of Hsmar1 found in the SETMAR gene is under selection as it provides DNA-binding for the histone- modifying protein. Hsmar2 has been reconstructed multiple times from the fossil sequences. Mos1 (for Mosaic element) was discovered in Drosophila mauritiana. The Himar1 element has been isolated from the horn fly, Haematobia irritans and can be used as a genetic tool in Escherichia coli. = Other families = The rosa (DD41D) family is a family found in Ceratitis rosa. Pogo/Fot1 (DDxD) is yet another family in this superfamily, x indicating a variable length. IS630, a mobile element in Shigella sonnei, also belongs to this superfamily. A few additional new families with different lengths between the triads have been reported. Pogo, also known as Tigger in humans, has been domesticated by humans and yeast alike into the CENPB gene. Other human domestications of pogo include TIGD1, TIGD2, TIGD3, TIGD4, TIGD5, TIGD6, TIGD7, JRK, JRKL, POGK, and POGZ.  Trivia  The characteristics of the Mariner transposon inspired the science fiction novel The Mariner Project by Bob Marr.

It has since extended its scope to include open circuit scuba training and training for both recreational and technical diving sectors as well as snorkeling and freediving. History RAID was founded in 2007 by Barry Coleman to support diver training required for the Poseidon Mk VI Discovery Rebreather. RAID first developed training for rebreathers, they have since extended their programmes to include open circuit courses and both the recreational and technical levels. Barry Coleman is still working for RAID. RAID offers a complete range of online diver academic programs from beginner to instructor examiner levels in snorkeling, scuba and freediving. Barry Coleman sold shares to Jim Holiday and Paul V. Toomer in 2014. Jim Holiday was CEO / President until 2018. During this time RAID experienced exceptional growth and in 2018 RAID was purchased by Kalkomey Inc from Dallas TX. Paul V. Toomer, previously Director of Technical Training for Scuba Schools International, was appointed as Director of Diver Training for RAID in 2014. And President in 2019. In June 2016 RAID joined the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council as the first associate member. July 2016 they partnered with the Dive Pirates Foundation to bring adaptive scuba to more dive centers. Adaptive training is a system for adapting the skills training procedures to a better fit for the individual disabled but otherwise medically fit diver's personal requirements and abilities. The same theory, and skills training and assessment is used as for other divers. In October 2017, RAID obtained European Underwater Federation certification. In April 2018 RAID is purchased by Kalkomey Enterprises, LLC to expand their range of outdoor courses. Recognition RAID is a member of the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC). RAID is a member of the Rebreather Training Council. RAID obtained CEN and ISO certification from the EUF certification body in October 2017 for the following certifications: *ISO 24801-2 - RAID Open Water 20 *ISO 24801-3 - RAID Dive Master *ISO 24802-2 - RAID Open Circuit Instructor *ISO 11107 - RAID Nitrox Speciality *ISO 11121 - RAID Try Open Circuit Diving *ISO 13293 - RAID O2 Service and Gas Blender Certification issued by RAID is approved by the UK Health and Safety Executive for divers whose duties are described in regulations 10, 12, and 13 of the Diving at Work Regulations 1997. Training system RAID differs from the rest of the industry by having a comprehensive online training system. RAID claims to have the most advanced training model in the industry today, with over 60 programs online. Their no classroom approach covers their entire spectrum of training from snorkeling to rebreather diving. Delivering theory training online with no paper, no book and no plastic has allowed them to claim they have zero environmental impact. Once a course is passed the learner has lifetime access to that material. However, if a course is not completed in 6 months the learner will have to re- register. Academic material and certification are linked to the registration so, each student must register for their own class.

His literary work known as ≈öiva J√±ƒÅna Bodham on Shaiva Siddhanta has enjoyed great vogue and prestige among Tamilians compared to other well-known Hindu philosophies such as Advaita of Adi Shankara and Vishistadvaita of Ramanuja.  Background  Meykandar was born to Achyuta KalappƒÅlar and Mangalambikai, ardent devotees of Lord Shiva who lived in the TirupennƒÅkadam village of present-day Cuddalore District, Tamil Nadu. It is said that they were troubled over their childless state which led them to be counselled by their family guru, SakalƒÅgama Panditar, who advised them to do a penance at Thiruvenkadu Siva Temple. As a result, conceived and gave birth to a boy. They named him \\"Swethavana perumƒÅl\\", after the name of the deity at Thiruvenkadu. Swetavana Perumal was brought to his maternal hometown Thiruvennainallur by his uncle. One day while he was playing in the street, he was attracted by Rishi Paranjyoti, who \\"descended from Kailash\\". Paranjyoti initiated Swetavana Perumal as his disciple and gave him the diksha NƒÅmam, \\"Mey KandƒÅr\\", the Tamil equivalent of his guru's name, Satya njnana darshini. Meykandar composed ≈öiva J√±ƒÅna Bodham, the core treatise of Southern Siddhanta tradition. It contains twelve aphorisms (Sutras) running to a total of forty lines, and deals with the nature of the three components of Saivism (Pati- Pashu-Pasam), and the means of attaining oneness with Siva. Many researchers conclude that ≈öivaj√±ƒÅnabodham might have been composed around 1223 CE. Santana Kuravar Sivan kovil at Thiruvennainallur, the living place of Meykandar. SakalƒÅgama Panditar, the family guru of Meykandar, once visited Meykandar and surprisingly became his disciple. He, later known as Arulnandi Sivan, composed Shiva Njana Siddiyar and Irupa irupahthu, in which he seconded Meykandar's ≈öiva J√±ƒÅna Bodham. Arulnandi sivan's disciple Marai njana Sampandar was the guru of Umapati Sivan who composed another eight texts explaining Saiva Siddhanta. These four personages ‚Äì Meykandar, Arulnandi Sivan, Marai njana Sampandar and Umapati Sivan are revered by the Tamil Siddhantins as \\"SantƒÅna Kuravars\\" (Lineage of Gurus).  Meykandar Siddhantism  Saiva Siddhanta Sampradaya was spread by Santana Kuravars during 13th and 14th centuries in Tamil land is known as \\"Meykandar Sampradaya\\" in philosophical perspective. It is also considered as a branch of Nandinatha Sampradaya, which flourished from the eight direct disciples (Sanatkumarar, Sanakar, Sanadanar, Sananthanar, Shivayogamuni, Patanjali, Vyaghrapada, and Tirumular) of Nandinatha. Meykandar Sampradaya is associated with the teachings of first disciple of Nandinatha ‚Äì Sanatkumarar.Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami (2003) \\"Dancing with Siva: Hinduism's Contemporary Catechism\\" Himalayan Academy Publications There are totally fourteen texts of Santana Kuravar and others admired by Tamil Saivites as Meykanda Saathirangal (Sastras of Meykandar or Sastras that perceived the truth). Though Saiva siddhanta is often identified as a pluralistic philosophy, it declares itself Vaidika Suddadvaita (Vedic Pure advaita) claiming that it interprets Advaita as it is.

She also became engaged in social work, founding the \\"Helferbund Rita von Gaudecker\\" welfare support organisation in 1945.Manfred Berger: Rita von Gaudecker. In: Kurt Franz, G√ºnter Lange/Franz- Josef Payrhuber (Hrsg.): Kinder- und Jugendliteratur. Ein Lexikon. Meitingen 2005, pp. 1‚Äì18.  Life  Rita Margarethe Klara Alexandra von Blittersdorf was born, the eighth of her parents' nine recorded children, in Molstow, a village near Greifenberg (as it was called before the ethnic cleansing of 1944/45) in East Pomermania. Her father, Carl Freiherr von Blittersdorf, was a minor aristocrat. Her mother, Ada Freiin von Behr, died from scarlet fever in March 1885, when she was not quite six. Her father never recovered from the blow, but she and her siblings nevertheless had a happy childhood. Looking back, she would later write: \\"What a truly untroubled existence a rural child has. Alongside the villagers, all the farm animals and the whole of nature. Gathering the unknowing powers of all these. Powers to defend and to transgress.\\"\\"Was lebt doch ein Landkind f√ºr ein echtes unverstelltes Dasein. Neben den Dorfleuten, allen Tieren des Hofes und der ganzen Natur. Unwissend Kr√§fte aus ihnen sammelnd. Kr√§fte der Abwehr und des √úberstehens.\\" Her Confirmation was followed by years as a \\"house daughter\\". Till 1906, when her youngest sister married, she took responsibility for running the household. Along with this, in 1914 she took charge of the \\"Kapellenverein Youth Association\\", also running its magazine, \\"Wir Wollen Helfen!\\" (\\"We want to help!\\"). From these beginnings, she occupied herself ever more as a writer, especially for children and young people. Her autobiographical children's book \\"Unter der Molstower Linde\\" (\\"Under the Molstow Linden Tree\\"), published in 1920, became a great success, and was still in print in the 1960s. Her religious works for children and Confirmation candidates also enjoyed great respect. These included \\"Weisst du, Wieviel Syernlein stehen? F√ºnfzig Kinderandachten\\" (\\"Do you know how many little stars there are? fifty children's adventures\\"), published in 1930, \\"So nimm denn meine H√§nde. F√ºnfzig Kinderandachten\\" (\\"So take my hands: fifty children's adventures\\"), published in 1933 and \\"Jesu geh vorn! F√ºnfzig Kinderandachten\\" (\\"Go forth Jesus: fifty children's adventures\\"), published in 1936. She also involved herself more generally in the affairs of the \\"Kapellenverein\\" a religious welfare organisation founded in Berlin in 1885, by to attend to the spiritual needs of impoverished workers from the east of Germany. The Kapellenverein had been concerning itself with child labour, and taking care of homeless and abusively treated children.Manfred Berger: Kroecher, Bertha Luise Ida von. In: Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon (BBKL). Band 24, Bautz, Nordhausen 2005, , Sp. 974‚Äì983. On 13 April 1914 Rita von Blittersdorf married the naval officer Gerhard Jobst August Moritz von Gaudecker. The marriage remained childless. After being stationed successively in Kiel, Constantinople and Wilhelmshaven the couple moved back to Pomerania. Here Rita von Gaudecker looked after what became a small network of several orphanages operated under the auspices of the Kapellenverein, the first of which had been relocated from Berlin to Kolberger Deep during the winter of 1916/17. A second was established in 1920/21 to look after the children of officers who had been killed in the recent war. Rita von Gaudecker was also in charge of a children's home in a house bequeathed to the Kapellenverein along Park Street Kolberg, where the focus was on children from villages who needed to be in the town in order to be able to attend school. For the younger children the establishment ran its own school under the direction of Rita von Gaudecker, helped by mostly young volunteers from the Christian organisation. Fund raising was a constant preoccupation, which she achieved both by personal visits to individual groups and using circular letters. Captain von Gaudecker kept the accounts. The change of government in January 1933 heralded a rapid and ultimately disastrous transition to a one-party dictatorship in Germany. It was far from easy to continue as before with the private running of a Christian children's home, with a shared Christian focus and frequent regular Christian worship. There was one senior Nazi who had once been a young helper at the home who was able to provide a level of protection. Nevertheless, the older children were obliged to join the Hitler Youth and then, following the outbreak in 1939 of another war, to become soldiers. Many came back from the front to spend any periods of army leave at Deep, but by the time the war ended, formally in May 1945, many had been killed in the fighting. At the start of 1945, with brutal ethnic cleansing underway in the east, the children were able to escape to Mecklenburg. They were then sent back, however, and survived for a few more months in Deep, which was now being inundated with refugees being forced out of Eastern Germany in order to make space for Polish refugees being forced out of what had previously been eastern Poland. In Deep, as the Soviet armies over-ran the region, the dangers facing the von Gaudeckers, now in their mid-sixties, were doubled on account of their aristocratic provenance (and name) and because Captain von Gaudecker was a retired army officer. They fled or were expelled from Deep and till October 1945 survived hunger and sickness, somehow, in the Berlin suburb of Treptow. From Berlin they moved to Holstein where they stayed till 1950 when they moved to stay with distant relatives on the other sid3e of the country, in Allmendingen (south of Ulm). Here Captain von Gaudecker, who had been in poor health for some time, died in 1954, while Rita was hospitalised with a broken hip, after which she was never again able to use stairs. Meanwhile, she had already, in 1945, founded the \\"Helferbund vom Kapellenverein\\", dedicated to the causes for which she had always worked, and while there were no longer children's homes, she had still been able to organise food parcels. After becoming immobilised in 1954 she seldom left her \\"large room in the tower\\" at her relatives' property in Allmendingen, but she remained energetic with her pen. In 1965 she finally retired from her chairmanship of the Helferbund which shortly afterwards was renamed as the \\"Verein in Helferbund Rita von Gaudecker e. V.\\", the name under which it still exists. Rita von Gaudecker died at the hospital in Ehingen, a couple of miles to the south of Allmendingen, on 18 March 1968.

He previously played for the De La Salle Green Archers in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), Fuerza Regia of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, and the Chorale Roanne of LNB Pro B Early life Mbala is a native of Yaound√©, Cameroon. He was first into football until the age of 13 when he grew about 6 feet 2 inches tall and switched to playing basketball. His older brother who manages the junior team of their municipality urged him to play for the team. He attended Institute Ndi Samba for his high school studies and made attempts to join his school's varsity team on his first two years. He continued to play for his municipality's team and managed to play for his high school in his last two years of secondary education. Career =Camp in South Africa= Mbala participated twice at an annual national basketball camp organized by Luc Mbah a Moute. He failed in his goal of making the All-Star Selection on his first year of participation but achieved it on his second try when he was chosen as one of the top 20 players of the camp. He was further declared as one of the top five players of the Mbah a Moute's camp, which gave him the opportunity to participate in the Basketball Without Borders camp in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2011. At the South African Basketball Without Borders camp, he won the African MVP Honors. His feat would have enabled him to study in the United States under a scholarship but visa issues prevented him from studying there. =College career in the Philippines= Southwestern University Moustapha Arafat, a former player from the Philippine University of the East invited Mbala to play basketball in the Philippines. He heeded to the invitation and went to study in a school in Cebu City in the Philippines instead. Mbala played for the Cobras of the Cebu-based Southwestern University (SWU) in the Cebu Schools Athletic Foundation, Inc. (CESAFI) in 2012. He led his school to its first CESAFI title in the history of the collegiate tournament winning over the University of the Visayas. At the 2012 Philippine Collegiate Champions League he led his team to a fourth-place finish.

The 6'8\\" Center played for La Salle at the University Athletic Association of the Philippines basketball tournament. Mbala originally planned to study and play for the Ateneo de Manila University.https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/sports/basketball/741549/la-salle- s-ben-mbala-reveals-he-almost-played-for-ateneo/story/ As a transfer student, Mbala had to serve a two-year residency. A one-year ban was imposed on him by the UAAP after he played at the Pacquiao Challenge Cup in December 2014 which was against the collegiate league's rules for players serving residency which caused him not to play for his school at UAAP Season 78. He was named part of the Mythical Five at the 2016 Filoil Flying V Preseason Premier Cup which was won by his team. At Season 79, Mbala made his UAAP debut for La Salle, and led the team to an 8‚Äì0 record halfway through the tournament and was the favorite to become the first foreigner to win the MVP Award since Anthony Williams of the FEU Tamaraws bagging the award in 1981 and he is the first Lasallian player who went on to win the MVP award since Don Allado who last won the said award in 1999. He was also the MVP in Season 80 despite his team losing to Ateneo in the finals. On 22 December 2017, Mbala announced his decision to not use his final year of eligibility and leave La Salle after five years. Mbala had one year of eligibility left to play for La Salle in Season 81. However his stint was uncertain since the UAAP board was set to discuss the \\"seven years out of high school\\" rule of the collegiate year which would have rendered him ineligible for the next season if the rule is abolished. =Professional career= Fuerza Regia Two days before Mbala announced his intention to leave La Salle, Fuerza Regia already announced via Instagram that Mbala will play for them. Mbala had a one-month stint with Fuerza Regia. According to his own account, Mbala was hindered by his veteran teammates while with Fuerza which made him unhappy with his stay with the Mexican ball club. Chorale Roanne French ballclub Chorale Roanne of LNB Pro B announced they have signed Mbala mid-January 2018. For Roanne, Mbala played 25 games where he averaged 11.6 points on 54 percent shooting and made an average of 5.6 rebounds per game. Mbala was made a role player in Chorale Roanne and was offered a contract renewal. However Mbala decided to move to South Korea after accepting an offer from the Seoul Samsung Thunders. Seoul Samsung Thunders On July 9, 2018, the Seoul Samsung Thunders of the Korean Basketball League announced that they have signed Mbala. Magnolia Hotshots Mbala became a standby player for the Magnolia Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association during the 2018 PBA Governors' Cup due to their import Romeo Travis sustained an injury.

As of that time, there were no rules in the UAAP preventing players to play for their national teams. While expressing gratitude for the invitation, Mbala declined as he did not want to risk his eligibility to play in the UAAP and had to maintain academic requirements to remain playing for his collegiate team. It was announced on February 5, 2017 that the Cameroon national team has included Mbala in their 30-man pool for the qualifiers and main tournament of the 2017 FIBA Africa Championship.

It has been recorded in the Suez Canal and there have been a few records in the eastern Mediterranean, making it a Lessepsian migrant. Description Hyastenus hilgendorfi has a roughly pear-shaped carapace which is convex and bearing small tubercles and a downy coat, there is a small epibranchial plug. There are prominent projections on the gastric region, heart and gut. A pair of post-gastric tubercles are close to the orbits. Six mesobranchial tubercles are sub-equal to the sides of the midline. There are two divergent rostral spines, which have a length of two-thirds of the carapace in males but are much smaller in females. The retractable eyestalks are small. The chelipeds are the same length as the carapace, the merus has nodules in its proximal portion while the claw is smooth and glabrous. The merus of the pereopods also bear nodules, while the posterior border of the dactyl is spiny, the spines becoming successively larger distally. The separation of the rostral spines is u shaped or keyhole shaped. H. holgendorfi is a brownish colour. Distribution Hyastenus hilgendorfi occurs from the Red Sea through the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific to Hawaii and south to Australia. It is reported to occur throughout the Suez Canal and the first record in the Mediterranean was recorded off Israel in 1960. The second record was in 1977 ad the third in 2004, which may mean there is a small population in the south eastern Mediterranean. Biology Hyastenus hilgendorfi is found on seabeds of coarse sand, debris and gravel, between 2 and 93 metres in depth. It is a \\"decorator crab\\" which uses other organisms to cover its body and in a study in the Suez Canal the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite, the tunicate Microcosmus sp., and the tube worm Hydroides elegans were found to be the most frequent epibionts. and up to 49 species of epbionts have been recognised for this species in the Suez Canal.

In 1855, the Eastgate Street market was rebuilt and modernised. The indoor shopping centre was built between 1966 and 1974 during a large redevelopment of Gloucester City centre.

Eastgate Shopping Centre consists of a large indoor street, with a ninety degree intersection in the middle. It runs from Eastgate Street to Southgate Street, with a side entrance to Greyfriars. The indoor street is lined with shops on both sides. At this time the centre also included a new market hall and a large Woolworths store which had entrances onto both Eastgate and Southgate street. The centre linked to the Longsmith Street car park and Kings Walk car parks. A pedestrian footbridge on the second floor spanned over Eastgate Street to link the Eastgate and Kings Walk shopping centres however, this has now been closed off. In 1994 redevelopment work was carried out which included some of the columns being faced with architectural features and the Beatrix Potter clock and figures were added next to the market. The cemetery from Greyfriars, founded in 1231, is now under the Eastgate shopping centre. The Mall Fund bought Eastgate shopping centre in 2004 for ¬£40 million from Catalyst Capital, then Rockspring Property Investment Managers and The Other Retail Group brought it in 2010 for ¬£136 million. In January 2019, Gloucester City Council bought the shopping centre in the region of ¬£12 million from Rockspring Property Investment Managers and The Other Retail Group. On 23 March 2009, Heart Gloucestershire was launched from the Bridge Studios within the shopping centre. Future Plans Between February 2018 and June 2018, work will be carried out to renovate the first floor of the shopping centre. The floor will be turned into a Digital Retail innovation Centre which will test and develop ‚Äúdisruptive digital innovations‚Äù, such as Robots and Holograms, in attempt to turn the shopping centre into a Digital Innovation Hub. Eleven small shop units are also being built. By 2025, it is planned to become a national centre for developing Holographic Virtual Employees and Robotic Security Guards. Gloucestershire's Local Enterprise Partnership program has provided ¬£400,000 to fund this project. Portico Entrance Eastgate Shopping Centre Portico Entrance The Portico entrance was built by Medland & Maberly in 1856 and was originally the entrance to the Eastgate market. In 1973, the portico was moved down Eastgate Street by about 25 feet from its original location to form the entrance to the new Eastgate Shopping Centre. The portico is made out of classical stone blocks. It is built in the monumental italianate style. The exterior consists of three arches with two central piers framed by a corinthian half column and two end piers framed by rectangular columns. All of the piers are set upon pedestals. Above the arches there is a crowning pediment with a clock in the middle flanked by seated figures sculpted in high relief. Father time is on the right and Ceres is the figure on the left. The crowning pediment supports an arched bell turret flanked by scrolls and topped with another pediment. There were pairs of Iron gates under each arch of the Portico. However, these were not replaced when it was rebuilt after being moved from the original site. In 2015, the original Iron gates were found in a council yard by the Gloucester Rotary Club. The portico became a grade II- listed building in 1975. Tailor of Gloucester clock- AKA Beatrix Potter Clock In 1994, due to the redevelopment of the shopping centre a large fish tank, inside the shopping centre next to the market entrance, was removed and the Beatrix Potter clock was added to replace it. The clock featured an animated Tailor of Gloucester, mice, owl and cat and took approximately fifteen months to build. On the hour, the clock would chime then music was played and all the figures would move. You would find crowds of people waiting to look at it. In 2013, another redevelopment off the shopping centre took place the clock was removed having been there since 1994. A petition to save the clock was created but the shopping centre donated it to the Pied Piper Appeal.

He was known for his work for Operaist journal Quaderni Rossi and his Marxist analysis of labour practices at Italian companies FIAT and Olivetti. Early life Alquati was born in 1935 in Klana, Croatia, where his father had been exiled because of his left-wing stance within the Italian Fascist party. When Alquati was 10, his father was executed by partisans in Vercelli in northern Italy. Alquati grew up in Cremona, where he shaped his political consciousness through meeting left-wing political militants, including Danilo Montaldi. Operaismo Before moving to Turin, he lived in Milan, at the political commune at via Sirtori 2. He moved to Turin when he was 25, where he joined the editorial staff of the political journal Quaderni Rossi alongside Raniero Panzieri, and in 1963 founded the journal Classe Operaia ('Working Class') with Mario Tronti and Antonio Negri Alquati's work studying labour practices in the Fiat factory in Turin was an early contribution to the sociology of work in Italy. He was influenced by the methodology of Danilo Montaldi and the barefoot researchers: he worked at the factories he was studying and lived with other workers. In this way, Alquati studied labour practices at the FIAT Mirafiori factory and at an Olivetti factory. His work stressed the nuances of and differences in the working class, and contributed to the idea of class composition developed by Operaist thinkers. Academic career In the early 1970s, Alquati left the factories to teach in universities, and continued to teach throughout the 1980s. His work anticipated deindustrialisation and the emergence of the service sector. During this period, his political thought diverged from earlier allies such as Toni Negri and Mario Tronti. He produced a study of the relationship universities to the working class, and taught a course on the subject at the University of Turin until 2003. His academic work focused on globalisation and its possible alternatives; the thought of Zygmunt Bauman on the liquid society; and women's history and politics.

Agency for Cultural Affairs Overview Located on a river terrace on the left bank of the Oirase River, approximately seven kilometers from the present-day Pacific coast at an altitude of 30 to 40 meters, this group of ancient tombs was variously known as the \\"Tenjinyama site\\" or the \\"Jusanmori site\\", and was believed by locals in pre-modern times to contain the graves of warriors, as evidenced by occasional fragments of swords and pottery which were uncovered by plowing nearby fields. After the discovery of magatama beads in April 1986, the site was extensively excavated between 1989 and 1990 by the local Oirase Town Board of Education, and were discovered to consist of 108 domed kofun dating from the first half of the 7th century to the early 9th century AD. Many of the tombs had a shallow circumferential groove resembling a small moat. The tombs contained the remnants of swords, agricultural tools, beads and other jewelry articles, Haji pottery, and horse harnesses and the remains of wooden sarcophagus. Many of items appear to have originated from the southern part of the Tohoku region, indicating frequent trade. The size of each tomb was approximately 10 meters in diameter, with a height of 1.1 meter. As the mounds are now flattened and do not appear above the present ground- level, a possibility exists that more undiscovered tombs exist in the area. Approximately 3 kilometers east of this necropolis is the Nakanodaira archeological site, where more than 100 pit dwellings were discovered. The Negishi archeological site, which was the site of a large pit dwelling, was also nearby, suggesting that the people of lived in the locations had some relationship with the construction of the tombs. In 2016, the town of Oirase completed construction of a local museum at the site. It is located approximately 10 minutes by car from the Aoimori Railway Mukaiyama Station.

The origins and development of the yard can be seen in considerations of the 1899 Royal Commission into the early stages of city railway traffic and the related joint select committee on the bridges over William Street (the Horseshoe Bridge) and Melbourne Road (which did not eventuate). It can also be considered to be the railway land between the Horseshoe Bridge and the West Perth subway. It preceded the Leighton and Forrestfield railway yards, and was in use until the development of the Forrestfield yard in the 1970s. The marshalling yard included access to the Perth Metropolitan Markets and other adjacent industrial sites. Most newspaper reports about the yard during its active years tended to be about accidents. Operationally, because of the proximity of the Perth railway station, a number of signal boxes were required to facilitate traffic into the yard and the interaction with regular services on the Fremantle railway line, as well as the Perth station until the reduction of services in the 1970s. The land occupied by the marshalling yard is now part of the Perth City Link project.

She was based in New York City. Early life and education Freedman was Jewish and born in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh to a traveling salesman and a nurse. As an adult Freedman photographed extensively in Ireland, quipping \\"I‚Äôm Jewish, but I adopted Ireland as my own old country\\".by Maureen Cavanagh October 16, 2019 pro-photo-daily Close-Up: Remembering Jill FreedmanBy Roslyn Bernstein December 6, 2017 Guernica In 1961, Freedman graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a major in sociology. In 1964 Freedman came to New York City and had several temporary jobs including advertising copywriter. She only discovered photography while experimenting with a friend's camera. Career After college, Freedman went to Israel, where she worked on a Kibbutz. She ran out of money and sang to make a living; she continued singing in Paris and on a television variety show in London. Freedman arrived in New York City in 1964, and worked in advertising and as a copywriter. As a photographer, she was self-taught, influenced by Andr√© Kert√©sz, idolizing W. Eugene Smith, but primarily helped by her poodle Fang: > When I was out walking in the street with Fang I saw everything, felt > everything. He had a great instinct. He taught me how to look, because he > never missed a thing. Andy Grundberg would also note the influences on her style of Smith, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Don McCullin, Leonard Freed, and Weegee; but would add that: \\"To appreciate [her] photographs one needs to consider their substance, not their style. . . . Human relationships ‚Äì especially the bonds of brotherhood ‚Äì fascinate her.\\" On hearing of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Freedman quit her job and went to Washington, DC. She lived in Resurrection City, a shantytown put up by the Poor People's Campaign on Washington Mall in 1968, and photographed there. Photographs from the series were published at the time in Life, and collected in Freedman's first book, Old News: Resurrection City, in 1970. A. D. Coleman wrote of the book: > It is a very personal yet highly objective statement, filled with passion, > warmth, sorrow and humor. Freedman's pictures are deft and strong; her text > witty, sardonic and honest, with quirky insights and touching moments of > self-revelation. A brave and moving book. Freedman then lived in a Volkswagen kombi, following the Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers Circus. For two months, she photographed \\"two shows a day and one show each Sunday. Seven weeks of one night stands\\", and moving across New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, Pennsylvania and Ohio. She wanted to photograph the performers as people. (\\"If I wanted to do freaks, I'd do guys wearing ties in 100-degree weather ‚Äì to me that's freaks.\\"A temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 38 degrees Celsius.) Coleman wrote: > [The photographs expose] both the photographer's own responses to people and > the personalities of her subjects. The moments she selects are significant > emotionally as well as graphically. Her images exclude the extraneous in an > inconspicuous way, and her sense of timing and gesture . . . is uncanny. The work was published as a book, Circus Days, in 1975. Freedman photographed the then sleazy area of 42nd Street and the arts scene in Studio 54 and SoHo. In 1975, Freedman started to photograph firefighters around Harlem and the Bronx. This took her two years; she lived with the firefighters, sleeping in the chief's car and on the floor. This resulted in a book, Firehouse, published in 1977‚Äîaccording to one review a book \\"flawed . . . by poor reproduction and inept layout\\". Some of the firefighters had previously been policemen, and they suggested that Freedman might photograph police work. Freedman had disliked the police but reasoned that there must be good policemen among them. For her series Street Cops (1978‚Äì1981), she accompanied the police to an area of New York City including Alphabet City and Times Square, spending time with those who seemed good cops. The work resulted in the book Street Cops. A contemporary reviewer for Popular Photography started by observing that \\"the passionate photojournalistic essay of yesterday\\" was \\"an endangered species\\", before saying that it lived on in photobooks such as this one. The reviewer described Street Cops as \\"[celebrating] the heroism, compassion, and humor of New York police professionals\\", and saying that the book \\"is traditional and satisfying in that it accomplishes a blend rarely successful ‚Äì or even attempted ‚Äì these days: an organic fusion of words and photographs\\". On photographing in New York at the time: > Hiding behind a camera, [Freedman] found her subjects where others were not > looking ‚Äì \\"beggars, panhandlers, people sleeping on the street,\\" the police > and the firefighters, the people washed ashore by forces bigger than > themselves. \\"It's the theater of the streets,\\" she said. \\"The weirder, the > better.\\" During the seventies, Freedman was briefly associated with Magnum Photos, but did not become a member. She wanted to tell stories via photography, but also wanted to avoid the schmoozing required to get commissions; and she therefore set her own tasks. She had difficulty making a living, but sold prints from a stand set up outside the Whitney Museum building. In 1983, New York Times critic Andy Grunberg recognized her black and white street photography in New York, grouping Freedman with Lee Friedlander, Fred R. Conrad, Bruce Davidson, Roy DeCarava, Bill Cunningham, Sara Krulwich and Rudy Burckhardt. In 1988, Freedman discovered that she was ill. The medical expenses meant that she had to leave her apartment above the Sullivan Street Playhouse;The Sullivan Street Playhouse occupied 181 Sullivan Street from 1958 to 2002. in 1991, she moved to Miami Beach; she was dissatisfied there but was able to read a lot. She sometimes worked for the Miami Herald. She also managed to publish a photobook of dogs that was praised for \\"[defying] the clich√©d images\\" of dog photography. She also published the second of two photobooks of Ireland, one that Publishers Weekly said \\"lovingly captures the enduring aspects of Irish tradition\\". Around 2003,\\"Five years ago\\", says a newspaper article published on April 27, 2008; therefore presumably in 2002 or 2003. Accessed March 4, 2017. Freedman moved back to New York. She was shocked and saddened by its sanitization during her absence: \\"When I saw that they had turned 42nd Street into Disneyland, . . . I just stood there and wept.\\" She moved to a place near Morningside Park in 2007, and was still living there in 2015. During the earlier part of her career, Freedman was captivated by the photographic printing process. She shot Kodak Tri-X and liked to use a 35 mm lens and available light, and to print on Agfa Portriga Rapid paper. As of late 2016, she neither had a darkroom nor missed it. She emphasized that the camera, whether film or digital, is merely a tool. When asked on another occasion, she approvingly cited Elliott Erwitt on not being boring and attempting to do excellent work; technical questions and even posterity should not be a concern. Freedman was one of 13 photographers shown photographing New York in Everybody Street, a 2013 film by Cheryl Dunn. Together with Richard Kalvar, Alex Webb, Rebecca Norris Webb, Maggie Steber and Matt Stuart, she was a featured guest in the Miami Street Photography Festival 2016 at HistoryMiami Museum during Art Basel week. Grundberg wrote in 1982 that \\"Indignation over injustice is the major key in [Freedman's] work, admiration for life's survivors the minor key.\\" Maggie Steber has said of Freedman: > I think she's been thoroughly under-recognized. . . . To me, Jill is one of > the great American photographers. Always has been and always will be. In 2016, Freedman's work and career, especially her images of New York City, was the subject of renewed interest, appearing in multiple Vice articles, including their 2016 photography issue and at Art Basel Miami. Personal life In her later life, Freedman lived in Harlem. On October 9, 2019, Freedman died from complications of cancer at a care facility in Manhattan.

It contains information on the geography, history, social custom and economy of territories of southern China, Guangxi in particular. More significantly it also provides knowledge of distant lands in China during the Song dynasty, and includes descriptions of oversea states as far away as Africa and southern Spain. Background The book was written in 1178 by Zhou Qufei. Zhou based his book largely on information he had gathered himself and other previous published works, particularly a book written by Fan Chengda. He worked for 6 years in Guangxi; and had worked as an assistant sub-prefect in Guilin, Guangxi. In Guilin, Zhou served for a time under Fan Chengda who wrote a book on the southern region of China, Guihai yuheng zhi (Ê°ÇÊµ∑ËôûË°°Âøó, \\"Well- balanced Records of Guihai\\"). Zhou received a copy of Fan's book while he was revising his own book to finish it, and he quoted extensively from Fan's work. The book also includes quotes from Huanghua Sida Ji (ÁöáËèØÂõõÈÅîË®ò) by the Tang dynasty geographer Jia Dan. Zhou had also worked as an Educational Commissioner in Qinzhou, a port in Guangxi, where he had the opportunity to question traders, sailors as well as interpreters for foreign merchants. He added the information on distance lands he had gathered in two chapters of the book he wrote. The original book is lost, and the current version was recompiled from entries in the Yongle Encyclopedia. A German translation, Das Ling-wai-tai-ta von Chou Ch'√º-fei: Eine Landeskunde S√ºdchinas aus dem 12. Jahrhundert, by Almut Netolitzky was published in 1977. Content There are ten chapters in the book, which concentrates mostly on the history, geography, custom and products of Guangxi, and it also contains information on southwest China, the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong as well as Hainan Island. It remains today an important reference for Guangxi of the Song era. Of particular interest are the two chapters that included descriptions of countries outside of China as well as their traded products. Some of the these are among the earliest accounts of distant countries as far away as Africa in Chinese records. As the information on foreign countries was gathered secondhand, the accounts given in the book may contain some exaggerations, inaccuracies and fanciful tales, but it gives a fairly accurate configuration of land and sea stretching from Korea to Spain. Some of the entries in the book were incorporated or adapted into Zhao Rugua's book Zhu Fan Zhi, for example this description of Mulanpi (Êú®Ëò≠ÁöÆ, Al-Murabitun) that covered part of northwest Africa (Morocco) and southern Spain, and it includes an early Chinese reference to northern Europe: See also *Zhu Fan Zhi *Daoyi Zhil√ºe References =Notes= External links * Lingwai Daida 1170s books Chinese prose texts ","title":"Lingwai Daida"},{"id":"53389404","text":"Pellenes striolatus is a jumping spider species in the genus Pellenes.

It is a humorous expose of the self-styled Godmen who make their living by duping innocent people. Plot Bhaajj (Gurpreet Ghuggi) is Punjabi man who owns a vehicle repair workshop and who hates women. Bhaajj's cousin Ravi works for him and his younger brother Rajveer is jobless. Rajveer seeks blessing from a local religious head Babaji (Yograj Singh) at his temple Ashram, Babaji's right hand preacher Swami gives his predicts to Rajveer that the latter will not find a job, but will start his own business. Inspired by Swami, Rajveer buys a second hand bus from a client of his older brother's workshop, and asks his older brother Bhaajj to renew it so that they can drive it as business. Bhaajj reluctantly agrees. They give all female passengers 50% discount as promotional strategy. and their advertisement emphasize on that they will protect all female passengers, unlike other buses, where female passengers are often harassed by men. One of their passengers Preet therefore develops her feeling for Rajveer. Soon, they find the business is hard for them as they can collect too few passengers each time, so they decide to use the bus as shuttle bus for Babaji's devotees. Babaji gives a trunk to Swami and Deepak (Harsharan Singh) with a girl's dead body inside, asking them to deal with the body smoothly. They agree, hinting this is not the first murder they have committed. They decide to use Rajveer's bus to drop the body. They load the trunk on the roof of the bus, planning to drop the body in a river when the bus crossing it. However, in the night, when the bus is passing a bridge and Deepak is almost dropping the body from the roof, Ravi, who is driving the bus at the time and very sleepy, suddenly hits the brake due to a sudden awake. Deepak unintentionally drops the body from the front side of the bus due to the shake. Ravi, Bhaaj and Rajveer get off the bus to check what happened. They are all shocked to see a dead body lying in front of the bus -- which is nobody but Preet -- and think it's Ravi that hit her to death. They decide to load it to the roof and drop it somewhere so that nobody will know it. The next day, they drop the trunk in a river when the bus is temporarily stopped. Two bums spot the scene, assuming the trunk is full of treasures and get it back. They catch another bus and on the roof to secretly open and share the \\"treasure\\". However, to their shock, it's dead body inside. When the bus stops, the bums move the trunk to the roof of another bus that is right beside theirs. The other bus happens to be Rajveer's. Ravi and Deepak are later shocked and scared to see that the trunk containing the dead body is back on the bus roof, thinking it has become a ghost and will take revenge. However, Ravi and his men decide to drop it again. When they arrive a hospital, they take to dead body inside and put it on a patient bed.

She is a professor and chairholder for English literature at the University of Zurich as well as a global distinguished professor at New York University. Her research interests include 19th- and 20th-century American and British literature, gender studies, psychoanalysis as well as the intersection and interaction between different cultural media.  Academic career  Elisabeth Bronfen studied German, English and Comparative literature at Radcliffe College and Harvard. From 1985 until 1992, she worked as an assistant at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and wrote her doctorate on Dorothy Richardson's Pilgrimage novels. Bronfen has held a chair at the University of Zurich since 1993, where she wrote her habilitation Over Her Dead Body (1992).  Works  In Over Her Dead Body (1992), Bronfen presents death as a fundamental deficit that is often negotiated over female bodies (be they dead or alive) in Western societies, citing Wuthering Heights, Frankenstein, and Vertigo. The literary and/or visual representation of death can therefore be read as a symptom of western culture, in which the female body epitomizes the Other whose death is imagined culturally. In The Knotted Subject (1998), Bronfen relates the \\"elusive, protean, and enigmatic psychosomatic disorder\\" of hysteria to cultural works by Ann Raddcliffe, Anne Sexton, Alfred Hitchcock, David Cronenberg, and Cindy Sherman. In her analysis, the human navel serves as a metaphor for both connection and detachment that is linked to the eponymous knotted subject of the hysteric because it too stems from a knot. Home in Hollywood (1999/2004) is an analysis of the portrayal of psychological processes in film classics such as Rebecca, The Wizard of Oz, and The Searchers. In particular, Bronfen traces the depiction of the Freudian Uncanny in these films. Her main thesis is that a \\"knowledge of the uncanniness of existence\\" remains visible in these movies despite their attempts of making sense of reality by giving the viewers a metaphorical home in the cinematic world. In Specters of War (2012), Bronfen analyses how Hollywood cinema and American television come to terms with US military history. From the \\"unfinished business\\" of civil war in Gone with the Wind and Gangs of New York to the \\"choreography of battle\\" in Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers, Bronfen investigates the parallels between military and cinematic spectacle. In Night Passages (2008/2013), Bronfen traces night as a trope from William Shakespeare through 19th-century realism to film noir and links the nocturnal to the primordial darkness that existed before the advent of in western culture‚Äôs \\"mythic narratives.\\" Mad Men, Death and the American Dream (2015) is an analysis of Matthew Weiner‚Äôs award-winning TV show Mad Men. According to Bronfen, the show not only successfully revives the past, but also comments on the state of the US nation and the role of the American Dream in the 20th century. In 2017, Elisabeth Bronfen's collection of essays in visual culture Crossmappings (2009) will appear in English. Therein, Bronfen proposes a reading method of the same name that is based on mapping and comparing formal aspects of cultural texts such as character constellations or political themes. According to Bronfen, this method allows for new insights into both the earlier and the later text. Rolf L√∂chel calls crossmapping a comparative method that not only uncovers intertextualities but also carves out similar concerns of texts from different media such as literature, cinema, television and painting. Amongst others, Bronfen crossmaps Charlotte Perkins Gilman‚Äôs novella The Yellow Wallpaper with the photographic oeuvre of Francesca Woodman, pop art with Baz Luhrmann‚Äôs Shakespeare adaption Romeo + Juliet, as well as Shakespeare‚Äôs Henriad with David Simon‚Äôs The Wire. In her teaching, Elisabeth Bronfen has further crossmapped Macbeth with Beau Willimon‚Äôs House of Cards and traced the rewritings of A Midsummer Night's Dream in Hollywood from Max Reinhardt‚Äôs 1935 adaption via George Cukor‚Äôs The Philadelphia Story and Howard Hawks‚Äô The Big Sleep to Susan Seidelman‚Äôs Desperately Seeking Susan.

It was once a port city on an estuary of the Nile, but is now inland of the Mediterranean Sea. In ancient times it was known as Diospolis Inferior. It has a complex of temples. History First called Smabehdet or Behdet, the Ancient Egyptian city from 2400 BC or earlier. About 1200 BC, during the New Kingdom of Egypt, it was named Paiuenamun, meaning \\"The Island of the [god] Amun\\". It was the ancient form of the name of Balamun. Tell el-Balamun, located in an agricultural area in the Nile Delta, it was a port city of an estuary of the Nile (but is now from the Mediterranean Sea due to the advance of the Nile delta). It was the site of a complex of temples. A Ramesside temple enclosure holds temples from the 26th and 30th dynasties for Nekhtnebef, Psamtik I, and Shoshenq III. There was also a cemetery for elite citizens near the temple enclosure. There was also a tomb of Iken, a Lower Egyptian Vizier, from 900 B.C. In antiquity, the stones for the temples were removed and used for other structures or burnt for lime. The city was continuously occupied until the 6th century A.D., when it was an ancient Roman city with a limestone slab paved road. Archaeological site The archaeological site, more than a kilometre in diameter, is a series of mounds up to . What survives within the site are a fortress, other mud structures, and trenches that show the walls of the temples. In 1913, Howard Carter of the Griffith Institute of the University of Oxford performed an archaeological excavation. Francis Ghattas of Mansura University carried out work in 1977 and 1978. The British Museum sponsored excavations beginning in 1991, in partnership with the Egypt Exploration Society, Polish Academy of Sciences and Polish Center for Mediterranean Archaeology. The project continued until 2010.

After serving there for 15 years, she married the French foreign minister Georges Bidault. Early life and education Borel was born in Toulon on 18 October 1904, the daughter of √âlie Borel, a graduate of the √âcole Polytechnique and a colonel assigned to the French colonies, and Louise Fontan, whose father Jules Fontan was a celebrated navy physician. Her childhood, spent in France, Senegal, Madagascar and Vietnam, included a secondary education in Dakar, Toulon, N√Æmes and Montpellier. After obtaining her baccalaur√©at in 1922, she first studied philosophy graduating in 1927. She went on to study Chinese at the √âcole des langues orientale and at the √âcole des Sciences Politiques. In February 1928, her mother sent her a newspaper cutting from Le Temps announcing a decree permitting women to take the competitive examination for entry into the diplomatic service. She had always dreamt of becoming a diplomat but it had been a career open to men only. Her first attempt at the examination was not successful but after the director of Sciences Po, Ren√© Saydoux, allowed her to participate in a special preparatory course, she succeeded in passing the examination the following year, becoming the first woman to enter France's diplomatic service. Career On entering the Foreign Ministry, Borel was informed that she would not be able to work in the many departments which were still reserved for men and was asked to sign a document confirming her understanding that she would only be permitted to work in the Paris offices of the minister. Even there, the only areas open to her would be the press, the department overseeing French participation in the League of Nations, and that regulating French works abroad, the one to which she was finally assigned. She remained there until 1944, latterly in Vichy. In her own words, \\"It was a sort of depository dealing with sports, the press and associations as well as with French charities abroad.\\" During the German occupation, Borel distinguished herself as a resistance worker. In May 1944, the Gestapo tried to arrest her, forcing her into hiding. When the war was over, Georges Bidault, the new foreign minister, invited her to work for him, promising her a post in Kiev. But it never materialized as they married in January 1946. After working independently in the diplomatic service for 15 years, she entered the traditional career of a diplomat's wife, accompanying him on trips abroad, at receptions and on election campaigns. In 1952, she took up part-time employment at the Office fran√ßais de protection des r√©fugi√©s et apatrides (French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons).

Previously elected Keeper in 2017, she was elected as the first female President of the Royal Academy of Arts in London on 10 December 2019.https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/rebecca-salter-pra-first-female- president-of-the-royal-academy Formerly a ceramicist, she is best known as painter and printmaker. Salter specialises in woodblock printing, combining Western and Eastern traditions. She has written two books on Japanese wood blocks: Japanese Woodblock (2001)Japanese Woodblock (2001) and Japanese Popular Prints: From Votive Slips to Playing Cards (2006).Japanese Popular Prints: From Votive Slips to Playing Cards (2006) Education Rebecca Salter trained at Bristol Polytechnic, graduating in 1977. According to Gillian Forrestor, George Rainer, Salter's teacher at Bristol, motivated his students to not be confined to their desired mediums, but to use the opportunity of university to experiment. Salter enjoyed the freedom to engage with mixed medias and practices, which has become an integral part of her ongoing practice. In 1979, Salter received a Leverhulme Scholarship enabling her to become a research student at Kyoto City University of Arts in Japan until 1981. She studied traditional Japanese woodblock printing with professor Kurosaki Akira. Work Salter lived and worked in Japan from 1979 to 1985. This move changed the nature of her work significantly, having an impact not only on her palette but on her artistic practice also. She began working more with two-dimensional works, creating pieces that complicate the relationship between painting, drawing, printmaking and sculpture. Her earliest, Untitled B119 (1981), is a suite of woodblock prints on paper, stained with persimmon juice, to give the impression of age, reminiscent of Japanese wab. She also studied calligraphy in the evenings, which she learnt was more than merely drawing lines but about dynamic movement. Arriving back in London, in 1985, Salter took up painting on canvas. Though she was no longer a ceramicist, she continued to view her practice as ‚Äúmaking an object‚Äù rather than a surface. Her time in Japan continued to prevail through this new medium. Calligraphic traditions can be seen through the lines in Untitled RR21 (2009), which Sadako Okhi suggests is reminiscent of a lily pond by Monet, where the lilies have been replaced by killifish. She won the Pollock-Krasner Foundation award in 1995 and the Cheltenham Open Drawing award in 1997. In 2009, Salter worked on the refurbishment of St George's Hospital in Tooting, south London, in collaboration with architects Gibberd. The refurbishment demonstrated her engagement with the Japanese concepts of space and her belief in the therapeutic value of art. Salter said: :‚ÄúFor my inspiration as to how to transform the new main entrance into a special place, I turned to aspects of Japanese art and architecture which have influenced me since studying there earlier in my career. The most important spatial concept I wanted to introduce was an intuitive way of navigating using light and texture. I hope that anyone arriving at the perimeter of the site will no longer need to study a map for directions.‚Äù Salter has twice (2003, 2011) been artist in residence at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, Connecticut, where she envisaged her work would be a tribute to Josef Albers‚Äô practice. Salter exhibits regularly in London, and internationally. In 2011, she had her first major museum retrospective, Into the light of things, at the Yale Center for British Art, Connecticut. It was more than a conventional retrospective of a single artist's work; it was a sustained investigation of the centrality of drawing to art making and of the notion of a dialogue between Eastern and Western aesthetics, artistic practice, and architecture. Although Salter's influence from her travels are clear, Salter prefers not to travel needlessly to reserve more time for working in her studio. Despite this, Salter does believe that artists should be able to work in any environment. =Royal Academy of Arts= In 2014, Salter was elected as a Royal Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts in London. In 2017, she was elected as Keeper of the Royal Academy, with the responsibility of guiding the RA Schools. She was elected as the first female President of the Royal Academy on 10 December 2019. She will continue to hold the position of Keeper until an election is held to appoint a new Keeper of the RA Schools in 2020.

He was also a noted farmer and stockbreeder on his estate, Hewelsfield Court, in Gloucestershire. He was born in Grindon, County Durham, England in 1804. He and his brothers John and Paul were later engaged in various railway works in England and Wales including Whiteball Tunnell on the Bristol and Exeter Railway, the South Devon Railway and the South Wales Railway. Robert Sharpe also completed works for Gloucester and Deane Forest Railway, Cornwall Railway and the Great Western Railway. In 1851, Robert had a steam powered flour and grist mill built in Chepstow, between the gas works and the railway embankment. He ran the mill in partnership with Mr. James Ireland, a cornfactor and miller from Bristol, under the name The Chepstow Steam Mill Company. The firm was successful for a number of years, but was sold in 1863 after running into difficulties. On 8 February 1860, Robert Sharpe & Sons (a partnership between Robert and his two sons Paul Wallace and William John) signed a contract with the San Paulo Railway Company, to build a line between Santos and Jundiahy, via S√£o Paulo, for the agreed sum of ¬£1,745,000. On 1 October 1866 the railway was completed, handed over to and accepted by the company. Robert Sharpe died on 25 July 1868 at Addlestone, Chertsey, Surrey, aged sixty four. He was buried at St. Margarets, West Hoathly. Chancery Court of Appeal: Sharpe v. San Paulo Railway In 1871 Paul Wallace Sharpe and William John Sharpe attempted to sue San Paulo Railway to recover additional costs of ¬£617,143 which they had incurred when the company's engineer had altered the plans from the original specification. The case reached the Chancery Court of Appeal in 1872, but was thrown out. Lord Romilly and Sir W. M. James stated that if the contractors had disapproved of the new arrangements, they ought to have entered into a fresh contract with the company. It was clear, they said, that the engineer had no power to alter the contract, and that the verbal agreement between him and contractor could not bind the company. Shortly after this, the company Robert Sharpe & Sons was dissolved.

The Texas legislature granted the college another charter on February 11, 1860, as a non-sectarian institution consolidating Waco Female Seminary and Waco Female Academy; it may also have been initially known as Waco Union Female Institute, which was chartered on February 16, 1858.Mary M. Standifer, \\"Waco Female College\\", Handbook of Texas online, June 15, 2010, retrieved March 5, 2017. Waco Female College was initially located on a square site that had been designated for a woman's college in the initial 1849 plat of Waco. A building was erected there in 1859‚Äì1860, but around 1892 the college moved to a site of about 13¬Ω acres on the outskirts of the town. The college began with preparatory (high school) and collegiate departments; facilities for boarders were added in 1872, and kindergarten and primary departments in 1883. Enrollment that year was 126, and rose to 202 in 1893. In 1890 it was listed as one of three \\"institutions for the superior instruction of women\\" in Texas.\\"Introduction by the Translator\\", Helene Lange, Higher Education of Women in Europe, tr. L.R. Klemm, Preface by T. Harris, New York: Appleton, 1890, , p. xxxii. The college charged $25 tuition per term, a $5 advance diploma fee, and $70 for boarding. It offered courses in penmanship, map- drawing, ancient and modern geography, American and world history, \\"evidences of Christianity\\", mental \\"phylosophy\\", trigonometry, astronomy, geology, botany, physiology, English, rhetoric, and Latin; all of these were required to complete a degree, except that French, German, art, or music could be substituted for Latin. Students were also required to take \\"physical culture\\". The college closed in 1895 for financial reasons; it may have been over- extended by its recent expansion and affected by the 1893 financial depression in the US. Add-Ran Christian University, a precursor of Texas Christian University, then bought the buildings and 15 acres of land from the Christian Church of Waco, which added a cash incentive and moving funds.Eric S. Ames, Waco, Images of America, Charleston, South Carolina: Arcadia, 2009, , p. 118. The university operated there until a fire in 1910, after which it relocated to Fort Worth.

It is one of the villages under Abikpi (Ebikpi) sub-clan of Eket Offiong clan. It is bounded by Afia Nsit, Ofriyo and Odoro Enen villages to the north, Ikot Ibiok and Mkpok villages to the south, Idua Village to the west and Ata Idong Ikot Usoekong village to the east.

From Ndon Obong the people settled at Ikot UdomaCertified True Copy of the Judgement of the High Court of South Eastern State of Nigeria in Joseph Asamudo & Anor vs Akpan Jimmy & Anor Suit No. C/3/60 and Afia Nsit villages while some people crossed the Ubium creek to Nduo Eduo and other places. People of other clans also settled at Ikot Udoma, e.g. Afaha Eket, Nnama and Abighe. Of these only Afaha Eket people are still living in the village with the Abikpi people. Composition The village is made up of four lineal groups known as \\"ekpuk\\", i.e. a group of related families tracing their origin to a common ancestor. These \\"Ekpuks\\" are Ekpuk Ndito Asamudo Nnua Edem, Ekpuk Ndito Inyang, Ekpuk Afaha Eket and Ekpuk Nung Assam Ekanim. These four \\"Ekpuks\\" are divided into ten families namely, Nung Edohoeket, Nung Nkamiang, Nung Asamudo Otu, Nung Akpedem, Nung Isonguyo and Nung Ekid Okpo (Ekpuk Ndito Asamudo Nnua Edem), Nung Inyang and Nung Ikott (Ekpuk Ndito Inyang), and Nung Assam Ekanim (Ekpuk Nung Assam Ekanim) and Nung Ekang (Ekpuk Afaha Eket). The village now has a cosmopolitan outlook which is reflected in its increased population and the varied ethnic composition. A good percentage of the population is made up of non-indigenous people who have settled in the village in the last twenty years when Eket witnessed increased population due to the expanded operations of Mobil Producing Nigeria. The village is led by a Village Head who is supported by a Town Council made up of representatives of the ten families. The current Village Head is Chief Sampson Simon Obot, a businessman and grandson of late Obong Nkamiang Asamudo Nnua Edem, Clan Head and Chief Priest of Abikpi in the nineteenth century. Chief Obot was selected by the kingmakers of the village in August 2017 but was accorded recognition by the Akwa Ibom State Government on November 7, 2019. Religion As indigenous African people, before the advent of Christianity in the area, Ikot Udoma people practised traditional African religion under which \\"Akwa Abasi Ibom Onyong\\" (meaning the Great God of Ibom who dwells on High) was recognized although sacrifices and libations were also made to a pantheon of deities and ancestors. The principal deities of the village were \\"Idim Ntied\\" for Ndito Asamudo Nnua Edem and \\"Ibit Ayu\\" for Ndito Inyang. Various cults and secret societies were widely practised and celebrated, e.g. Ekpo, Ekpe, Inam, Ekong, Idiong (for men), and Ebre and Iban Isong (for women). Slavery, human sacrifice, the killing of twins and the banishment of twin mothers were a few of the social and religious practices that the Christian Missionaries, e.g. Mary Slessor, Samuel Bill, etc and the nascent colonial administration contended with in the last decade of the nineteenth century, e.g. the colonial military expedition to the village on February 7, 1899The Twenty Years War, Invasion and Resistance in Southeastern Nigeria 1900 - 1919 by Robert D. Jackson, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1975, page 335 which led to the destruction and burning of houses and the loss of priceless elephant tusks and other valuables. Up till today, the villagers still remember the \\"white man's\\" war and the atrocities that were committed.Certified True Copy of the Judgement of the Eket District Court in Civil Suit No. 412/53 between Wilson Asam Udo & Edward Nkamiang Asam Udo vs Udo Nkamiang Udo Ntuen & Ekong Nkamiang With the advent of Christianity arising from the founding of Qua Iboe Church by the Rev Samuel Alexander Bill at Ibeno in 1888, Ikot Udoma became a bastion of Christianity early in the twentieth century, especially with the establishment of Qua Iboe Church in Ofriyo village which served the four neighbouring villages - Ofriyo, Ikot Udoma, Odoro Enen and Afia Nsit commonly known as Idong Iniang (Four Towns). Today the village has many churches and ministries, namely, Qua Iboe Church, Faith Terbanacle Congregation, Christ Apostolic Church, The Church of Christ, Assemblies of God Church, Mount Zion Lighthouse Full Gospel Church, The Apostolic Church, The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Glory world International Gospel Centre, Abundance Life Ministries, etc. Education The first school in the area was the Primary School established by the Qua Iboe Church, Ofriyo which served the four villages. The School was taken over by the Eket County Council in 1964 and is now known as Primary School, Idiong Iniang, to reflect the commitment of the four villages to its existence and progress. The first school to be sited in Ikot Udoma Village was the UPE School along Ikot Ibiok Road which was established by the Eastern Regional Government in 1957. The Universal Primary Education (UPE) programme of the Eastern Nigerian Government failed and this school did not grow beyond Standard 5 before it was downgraded to the status of a Junior Primary School (Primary 1 to Primary 3).It was merged with Primary School, Idong Iniang, in the early 1970's. The site of this historic school has since been re-possessed by some of the villagers. The village now has several Secondary and Nursery/Primary schools, e.g. Community Secondary School, Idong Iniang (jointly established by the Idong Iniang Welfare Association and the four villages of Idong Iniang), Excellent Comprehensive Secondary School, Dayspring High School, Donema Nursery School, Victina International School, MC Prime Montessori Nursery School, etc. Health Care The only government-owned health facility in the area is the Polyclinic at Afia Nsit village which is run by the Eket Local Government. Commercial Activities Several business undertakings provide catering services, entertainment and relaxation, e.g. Modern City Guest House, Tinkle Fast Food, Octagon Event Centre, etc. The IDEMGH-LINK GROUP OF COMPANIES has recently established in the community to provide services in the oil industry. Numerous small-scale shops and stores in the village anchor commercial activities but there are also locked up stores at Udua Obo which used to be a daily evening market patronized by the four villages up to the 1980's. Ikot Udoma used to be the home of By the Grace of God Motors, which operated luxury bus services between Eket/Ikot Abasi and Lagos. The company has since closed down. In the 2000's the Akwa Ibom State Government established a Low Cost Housing Estate in the village.

Revista de Filologia 28 (2012)  Life  Her full name is Ana Mar√≠a Caro de Mall√©n y Torres. Her parents were Gabriel Caro de Mall√©n and Ana Mar√≠a de Torres. They were actually her adopted parents, since she was born as a morisco slave. It is thought that she was the sister of Don Juan Caro de Mall√©n y Soto, born in Granada.  Career  Caro de Mall√©n's career took off in 1628 when she published poetry as well as studies on festivals and cultural activities. She had moved to Madrid by 1637 when she published Contexto de las reales fiestas madrile√±as del Buen Retiro. She was a friend of the famous novelist Maria de Zayas and was recognized by many of her male counterparts including Juan de Matos Fragoso and Luis V√©lez de Guevara. She earned money from some of her works of poetry and from her theater and is thus considered one of the first professional women writers Lola Luna. \\"Ana Caro, una escritora ‚Äòde oficio‚Äô del Siglo de Oro,\\" Bulletin of Hispanic Studies, Jan 1,1995; 72, 1, pp. 11-26. Ana Caro was the author of two religious plays (in Spanish, autos sacramentales) as well as a number of entremeses, which are short interlude plays placed between acts of comedias. Two of her entremeses survive, A loa sacramental and Coloquio entre dos. Only two of Caro de Mall√©n's full-length plays are known today, El conde partinupl√©s and Valor, agravio y mujer (Courage, Betrayal, and a Woman Scorned).  Writing Style  Being that Caro de Mall√©n was a poet, a poetic style of writing shone through in her dramas. She was known for writing dialogue that included single stanza verse shifts between characters that were made up largely of exchanges of metaphor. Many consider the bantering style of Caro de Mall√©n's plays witty. The majority of her plays include a wide range of characters, from servant characters who speak in low-brow humor to characters born of nobility. Through her comedic plays Caro de Mall√©n made comments on the social and political realities of 17th century Spain. Popular thematic ideas that are present in Caro de Mall√©n's work are revenge, honor, intrigue, and love triangles.

He had claimed in 1845 title to and a life interest in estates of the Wottons of Inglebourne, through his deceased first wife, which had led to Spitchwick House, Widecombe-in-the- Moor in Devon being attacked.

In 1997 Banca delle Marche became the parent company of the banking S.p.A. for 78.81% shares, with the rest were held by the banking foundation of Carilo. The move made Banca delle Marche one of the largest banking group in the region, which owned 4 out of 7 saving banks of Marche. (the remain 3 saving banks were C.R. Fabriano e Cupramontana and C.R. Ascoli (acquired by nationwide banking group and defunct in 2000s) and C.R.

Many of his statues decorate different central places all over Israel, from Metula in the north to Beer Sheva in the south.  Early life  Lifshitz was born in 1942 in Kibbutz Ma'oz Haim. He is the son of Israel (Srulik) and Lea Lifshitz of Shershevsky. He studied at the local school of Kibbutz Ma'oz Haim and served as a tankist at the Israeli Armored Corps of the IDF. Many members of the Lifshitz family are engaged in the arts of sculpture, painting, design, etc. Asaf is the cousin of the painter Uri Lifshitz. The author Dvora Omer is a sister of Asaf from his mother's side. Asaf worked as a metalworker in Kibbutz Ma'oz Haim and has been sculpting since his youth. He is an autodidact who has never attended an accredited school of art.  Artistic career  \\"The Drinking Pilot\\" ‚Äì the forefront of the Azrieli Center, Tel Aviv. \\"The Boy and The Horse\\" ‚Äì Ha'Shomer Square, Kfar Tavor. The majority of the sculptures of Lifshitz are outdoor statues made of cast bronze. Many of his statues depict playing characters and combine fantasy with reality, geometric figures with human figures. One of his notable works is \\"The Drinking Pilot\\", located at the forefront of the Azrieli Center in Tel Aviv. \\"The Drinking Pilot\\" is a statue made of bronze and stainless steel, which shows the image of the Israeli Air Force (IAF) pilots in a slightly different light. The IAF website describes the statue: \\"In 'The Drinking Pilot' Asaf Lifshitz tries to break the meticulous image of the Air Force pilots and shows the pilot when performing a daily activity of existence: drinking water straight from the tap. The pilot is half‚Äìdressed in his flight suit, his helmet lies on the ground and passers‚Äìby can just look at it closely, in contrast to the classic image of the pilot as a distanced and noble figure. Thus, Lifshitz gives humanity to the figure and creates solidarity in the viewer. The figure of 'The Drinking Pilot' is based on the pilot Major Boaz Gafni, who was killed at the age of 24.\\" In Kfar Tavor, about 11 of Lifshitz's sculptures are displayed, among the most prominent are: \\"The Boy and The Horse\\" statue, which stands at a Ha'Shomer Square in Kfar Tavor, and down the road the \\"Visit by The Rothschilds\\" statue stands in the Baron Square, which was created based on a photograph of The Rothschild couple visit in Kfar Tavor in 1914. In Holon stands \\"The Lion Who Loved Strawberries\\" as part of a Story‚ÄìGardens project: it is an impressive, large 2.5 meters tall bronze statue of a lion with his maw wide open and a bunch of strawberries inside it, accompanied by a large strawberry fruit statue.

One of its segments is Youth Resource, a website \\"created by and for gay, lesbian, transgender, and questioning young people\\" which encourages online peer educators to create an inclusive space. One of the most successful features of Youth Resource has been MyStoryOutLoud, a digital storytelling campaign for LGBTQ youth of colour to use technology to allow their voices to be heard and raise awareness of the need for safe spaces in communities. Using platforms such as Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram, LGBTQ+ People of Color can highlight their experiences in video or written narratives or other forms of art (including poetry and pictures). Another resource, Amplify (sponsored by Advocates for Youth) is an \\"online youth activism hub.\\" Advocates for Youth also has a cultural advocacy and mobilization initiative to empower youth through leadership training and encourage them to educate the community about safe spaces. Media impact Studies of racism, hetero- and homonormativity and positive role models for queer youth in media indicate that the lack of LGBTQ people of colour in media can affect LGBTQ youth of colour in coming out and their psychological development. According to the northwestern journal of law and social policy homelessness has risen over the years in the U.S., and homelessness has been addressed providing services and programs to help homelessness youth, however, these improvements regarding homelessness have not considered the differences among this population, the LGBTQ youth of color. According to Alone Without a Home, which reviewed state by state laws affecting unaccompanied youth, one of the biggest reasons for LGBTQ youth of color homelessness is that when the person decides to open up and say how they feel, their families turn against them and do not accept them; because of this, 20% of the youth have ended up leaving their houses. Homeless LGBTQ youth of colour rely on media (such as cellphones) for jobs, Internet access, resisting police harassment and documenting police misconduct.  Notable figures  = Transgender = Laverne Cox at the 2015 San Francisco Trans March Actress Laverne Cox, a black trans woman, has supported trans-youth rights on- and offscreen. With a spot on Time 100 Most Influential People List and an icon of LGBT History Month, she has used her fame and success to influence policy and increase acceptance. In speaking engagements and a documentary, Cox has created a dialogue for youth of colour and provided support and resources to her young transgender followers. In the midst of building her success, Laverne Cox was the first transgender woman to ever be on the cover of TIME Magazine. Then, most recently on July 10, 2014 she made history once more in the entertainment world when she became the first transgender actress to receive an Emmy nomination. = Gay and bisexual men = RuPaul became known for his drag-queen performances, his 1993 single \\"Supermodel\\" and the reality-TV RuPaul's Drag Race. On the show other drag queens lip-sync to remain in the competition, and it examines the issues of masculinity, male femininity, living with HIV, recovering from addiction, the transgender community and the fight for marriage equality. Hip hop singer and songwriter Frank Ocean released his debut studio album, Channel Orange, in 2012. Days before the album's release, Ocean used Tumblr to post an open letter reminiscing about his feelings for another young man. Frank Ocean Channel Orange received critical praise and six Grammy Award nominations. Def Jam Records co-founder Russell Simmons and other music-industry figures voiced support for Ocean. As one of the first openly-gay hip hop artists, he is credited with breaking barriers in hip hop and R&B; (which have had a history of homophobia).  Film and television  = Kiki culture = Inspired by New York's underground drag ballroom culture, Kiki is a subculture of the ballroom scene (which is spearheaded by LGBT youth of colour). Less formal than the ballroom scene, it provides a space for LGBT youth of colour to express themselves through performance and allows them to meet other LGBT youth. Kiki culture differs from ballroom culture in its focus on political and social activism, bringing attention to LGBT issues such as homelessness and HIV. It was brought to mainstream media through the documentary, Kiki, written by Sara Jorden√∂ and Twiggy Pucci. The band Scissor Sisters have also helped bring Kiki culture into the mainstream with their song, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Have a Kiki‚Äù which was released in September 2012 and was covered on the Fox television show Glee. = Documentaries = Laverne Cox‚Äôs Emmy-winning documentary, The T Word, focuses on the transgender community. The documentary examines the lives of seven teens and young adults who identify as transgender, sharing their experiences and daily struggles and focusing on campus bullying, attempts to change gender pronouns, family issues, relationships and sex. A second documentary examines the problem of youth homelessness in the LGBT community. About 500,000 youth experience homelessness, and 200,000 identify as part of the LGBT community; over 70 percent of homeless LGBT youth are people of colour. The documentary follows Beniah, Noel, Giovanno, Benjamin, Danielle and Zaykeem over and 18-month period; Noel and Danielle are women. = Characters = Shay Mitchell plays Emily Fields on the ABC Family series, Pretty Little Liars. Netflix's Orange Is the New Black includes a number of characters who identify as LGBT or question their sexuality in the penitentiary. Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley) is a black lesbian who was open about her sexuality before her incarceration. During the series, she develops a relationship with Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn). Although Brook dated men before entering prison, she pursues a relationship with her fellow inmate. Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox) is a trans woman who is harassed and struggles to obtain her necessary hormones. ABC Family's Pretty Little Liars has a main character‚ÄîEmily Fields (the multiracial Shay Mitchell)‚Äîwho is in a relationship with a black lesbian, Maya St. Germain (Bianca Lawson). Emily later becomes engaged to Alison DiLaurentis in the series. The Netflix series 13 Reasons Why includes the gay Hispanic Tony Padilla (Christian Navarro), a main character and distributor of the tapes. Tony comes out to Clay (the main character) near the end of the season, mentioning a lack of acceptance by his Catholic family, and dates Brad (another character). Unique Unique Adams (Alex Newell) is a young black trans woman on Fox's musical comedy-drama television series, Glee, which aired from 2009 to 2015. Glee touched on the school's bathroom policy, shedding light on a transgender issue, and Unique offers pivotal support of Coach Beiste after his sex reassignment surgery.

She was the central figure of a famous criminal court case which has often been referenced in Dutch literature. She was originally the daughter of an innkeeper in Orl√©ans. In 1507, she married the Dutch noble Gerrit van Assendelft (1487-1558) and followed him to the Netherlands. The couple separated, but she was given an allowance, and settled in the Hague. In 1532, her spouse deprived her of her allowance. In 1540, false coins started to circulate in the Netherlands. The same year, two young Frenchmen moved into her house, and her neighbors reportedly heard the sound of metal processing from her home. On the night of 11 February 1541, Catharina de Chasseur and her entire household was arrested for coining. In the following trial, she was judged guilty as charged and sentenced to death by burning. Her sentence was reduced to execution by drowning by the regent.  References  * Serge ter Braake, Chasseur, Catharina de, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland.

In Plato's Republic, Socrates is highly critical of democracy and proposes an aristocracy ruled by philosopher-kings. Plato's political philosophy has thus often been considered totalitarian. Critique of democracy In the Republic, Plato's Socrates raises a number of objections to democracy. He claims that democracy is a danger due to excessive freedom. He also argues that in a system in which everyone has a right to rule all sorts of selfish people who care nothing for the people but are only motivated by their own personal desires are able to attain power. He concludes that democracy risks bringing dictators, tyrants, and demagogues to power. He also claims that democracies have leaders without proper skills or morals and that it is quite unlikely that the best equipped to rule will come to power. =Ship of State= Plato, through the character of Socrates, gives an analogy related to democracy: he asks us to imagine a ship whose owner surpasses all those on the ship in height and strength, but is slightly deaf; his vision is similarly impaired and his knowledge of navigation is just as bad. He then asks us to imagine the sailors, all of which are arguing about who should have control of the helm while none of them have studied navigation. The sailors don't even know that there is such a thing as the craft of navigation. All the sailors try to convince the owner to give control of the ship over to them, and whoever convinces him becomes the navigator or captain. They manipulate and trick the owner into giving over the helm. The true captain, the one with the knowledge of navigation is seen as a useless stargazer and never becomes the helmsman. The true captain represents a philosopher-king, who knows the forms of justice and goodness. The ideal form of governance In the Republic, the character of Socrates outlines an ideal city-state which he calls 'Kallipolis'. =Classes in ideal society= Plato lists three classes in his ideal society. #Producers or Workers: The laborers who make the goods and services in the society. #Guardians/Soldiers: Those who keep order in the society and protect it from invaders #Philosopher Kings: are the most intelligent, rational, self- controlled, in love with wisdom, and well suited to make decisions for the community, and who promote the interests of the society as a whole. =Philosopher-kings/Guardians= Plato's ideal rulers are philosopher-kings. Not only are they the most wise, but they are also virtuous and selfless. To combat corruption, Plato's Socrates suggests that the rulers would live simply and communally. Contrary to societal values at the time, Socrates suggests that sex should not be a factor in deciding who should rule, so women as well as men can rule. Socrates proposes that the Guardians should mate and reproduce, and that the children will be raised communally rather than by their biological parents. The children's biological parents will never be known to them, so that no Guardian will prefer his or her own offspring over the common good. The children of the guardian class will be tested, and only the most wise and virtuous will become rulers. Criticism Karl Popper blamed Plato for the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century, seeing Plato's philosopher kings, with their dreams of 'social engineering' and 'idealism', as leading directly to Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin (via Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Karl Marx respectively).Popper, Karl.

Their trademark is a portrait of the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf, who supposedly in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War stopped by the village Krostitz on his way to Leipzig. According to legend he there ordered the local master brewer to bring him a refreshing draught. As a sign of his highest esteem, the king allegedly gave the master brewer a golden ring.  History  Their brewing privilege was granted in 1534 by Duke Georg von Sachsen to Hans Wahl on the Crostitz manor. In 1738 the brewery sold barley beer (Braunbier). In 1803 malt liquor (Doppelbier) and Kovent (a low-alcohol beer made from leftover wort) were also being brewed there. From 1867 to 1876 both brewery and malt house were completely rebuilt, and another remodeling happened between 1894 and 1899. The sales figures of beer increased steadily and amounted to 1899 ; at that time a staff of 200 was employed in the brewery. In Leipzig 84 restaurants and 110 beer stores sourced \\"Crostitzer Lagerbier\\", \\"Dunkel\\", \\"Bohemian style\\" and according to season \\"Bock\\" or \\"M√§rzenbier\\". In 1904 the term Ur-Krostitzer was used for the first time. After the brewery was communized during the GDR period of governance, it became part of the Radeberg Group in 1990, since then there were numerous new constructions and conversions. Today the brewery produces Schwarzbier according to a recipe from an old brewing manual of the brewery and an off-dry Pilsner. In celebration of the 470 year anniversary, the Ur-Krostitzer Jahresring is given as an award to amateur historians, who concern themselves with the history of the regions Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia, since 2004. In 2006 the brewery employed a staff of 112 people, it produced around 374.000 hectoliters of beer and supplied roughly 2600 gastronomical institutions.

Her spouse was a Protestant sympathizer. She herself was a convinced Catholic: her father was the founder of a Franciscan convent in Amsterdam, two of her sisters were nuns, while she was the leader of the Guild of the Holy Sacrament, a religious society that protected a pilgrimage chapel between Kalverstraat and Rokin, were a miracle allegedly took place in 1345, and which counted women from powerful burgher families among its members. In 1531, the city authorities decided that the chapel should be torn down and replaced with a wool shed. Engel Korsendochter and her society protested against the decision. On 31 May 1531, three hundred women marched in protest against the destruction of the chapel and the increasingly Protestant sympathies in Amsterdam, lead by Engel Korsendochter and the women of the Guild of the Holy Sacrament. The demonstration attracted great attention in contemporary Netherlands. The women were charged with four years of banishment or fines of 50 gulden for rebellion. The appealed to Charles V and defended their act as an act of defense for Catholicism. Most of them were pardoned. Engel Korsendochter is portrayed on an altarpiece.

Built between 1969 and 1972, it is part of the Kings Quarter development that includes an outdoor pedestrianised area. Beneath a trapdoor in the centre is the Kings Walk Bastion, the remains of a 1,900 year old Roman city wall and tower. History Before it became a shopping centre, it was called Kings Street. This was primarily an industrial area and included a factory, which was built in 1873, for the printer John Bellows. This area was gradually commercialised with a lot of rebuilding done after the first world war between the 1920s and the 1930s. The north part of Kings Street was demolished in the 1920s when Kings Square was built. One of the largest commercial developments took place between 1927 and 1929 and involved the creation of The Oxbode and Kings Square. It also involved the demolition of the many buildings in St Aldate Street, Kings Street and New Inn Lane, making room for new commercial buildings. Kings Square was enlarged in the 1960s and the space was made for the Kings Walk Shopping Centre to be developed. In a large redevelopment of central Gloucester between 1969 and 1972 which involved Kings Street, Kings Square, Dog Lane and Clarence Street, shops were built on both sides of Kings Street and it was covered becoming pedestrianised indoor area called Kings Walk. Eastgate House, an Adamish stone fronted building, was demolished when the shopping centre was developed. A rooftop car park was built over the shopping centre. A pedestrian footbridge on the second floor spanned over Eastgate Street to link the Eastgate Shopping Centre and Kings Walk however, this has now been closed off. In June 2016, the investment firm Vixcroft made a bid to buy the shopping centre from Aviva Investors, who have owned the shopping centre since 1969, for ¬£25 Million. However, due to a clause in the contract regarding Brexit the deal fell through. In July 2017, Reef Estates approached Aviva Investments and successfully completed a deal to buy the shopping centre. In March 2018, it was announced that ¬£12 million would be invested to reface the shopping centre and remodel shopfronts in Kings Square and Eastgate Street. The work is planned to be completed by 2020. Kings Walk Bastion Sideways view of the trapdoor to Kings Walk Bastion in Kings Walk Shopping Centre The Kings Walk Bastion is a 1,900 year old Roman city wall and tower, located beneath a trapdoor in the Kings Walk Shopping Centre. The earliest part of the bastion is thought to be a Roman fortress built around 60AD. Originally the bastion consisted of a sand and clay rampart with a wooden tower and a defensive ditch. At the end of the first century, the fortress was decommissioned so a new city could be built. This was intended to be a Roman Colonia. Stone parts of the bastion were built in the 3rd and 4th centuries, from Cotswold limestone. This wall was approximately five metres high and three metres wide and made part of the wall that surrounded the whole city at the time. The fourth century sections of the wall consist of massive blocks of stone with small rectangular holes on the inside where scaffolding would have been set. A semi-circular tower was added in the thirteenth century on the outside of the wall. Archaeologists began investigations in Kings Square in 1934, where they found the corner of a Roman city wall and remains of a medieval tower 2 to 3 metres underground. The site under Kings Street and Kings Square was fully excavated by archaeologists between May and June 1969 before the redevelopment of Kings Street. In 1975, the site was opened to the public however it had to be closed in the mid-1990s due to underground flooding. In 2016, the Gloucester city council restored electricity to the site, installed a pump and lighting. Then on the 8 September 2016 the site was reopened to the public. It is thought that the remains of a Postern Gate are also located under Kings Walk but the exact location of the gate is still unknown.

No far from High School N¬∞6 stand St. Vincent de Paul Basilica and Cyprian Norwid High School N¬∞1. The building is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Current director is Mrs dr Wies≈Çawa Burli≈Ñska.  History  = Creation of the gymnasium = This building was built between 1908 and 1910, on the impulse of the City Council of Bromberg, supported financially by the \\"Bromberg Shipping & Towing Company SA\\" (). The firm was very rich and influential in the city business, thanks to the river shipping traffic on Brda and Vistula rivers, having its seat in the LLoyd Palace at Grodzka Street 17. Gymnasium on a 1914 postcard Carl Meyer, a famous local architect, was asked to design the building. As usual at this time, he delegated the initial project to one of his collaborators, the architect Otto Brech. In Bydgoszcz, Brech also realized the building of School of Applied Arts (1910-1912) at Swiƒôtej Trojcy street 37. In 1911, the German institution opened at then Braesicke Stra√üe 8/11, first as a St√§tische knabenmittelschule (City medium school for boys), then as a Civic School for Boys (). = 1920-1939 = During this period, the building housed the Humanities High School for girls () of Bydgoszcz. On March 4, 1922, the school chapel was dedicated and in 1924, first students passed the Matura exam. Pupils were very active: they established in 1929, an association Summer Colony Society, and a permanent scholarship fund, in order to help their poor colleagues: it resulted in the construction of a holiday house, inaugurated on August 2, 1932. In May 1934, students edited a school magazine, \\"Girls in Uniform\\". From 1931 till the onset of WWII, Marian Turwid had been teaching drawing and arts there. = WWII = The edifice sheltered several institutions: * in 1939, a Polish primary school (few months) * a German school during the occupation * in 1945, a military hospital = Post war period = In September 1945, the building was taken over by the Municipal Secondary School. High School N¬∞6 was established September 1, 1948. Initially located at Olszewskieko street 20, (today Kordeckiego street), it moved in August 1950, to the current building at Staszica street 4. The newly school was the first in the region created by the Society of Friends of Children, a non-governmental association leading benefit activities for children (est. 1919). It was a year school for students from years 7 to 18. In 1950, associated with its move to new premises, the school changed its name to VI Gymnasium and High School. In 1958, the Ministry of Education approved its patron name, Jan and Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki, and its banner. From the middle of the 1960s, the institution turned exclusively to High school curricula. In September 1973, only High School N¬∞VI remained in the building. Copernicanum = Since 1990 = Most important developments of the facility took place in the 1990s. On December 6, 1991 High School N¬∞VI was admitted to the Society of Creative Schools (), an educational reforming movement born in the 1980s at High School n¬∞40 in Warsaw. It links today 30 high schools across Poland. The terms of reference of the TST association imposed the implementation by High School N¬∞6 VI LO of several rules, among which: * adopting innovation and organizational program developed by the TST; * having an educational program, both urban and rural; * organizing a club Promoting Talents and a Creative Teachers' Club; * opening grade \\"0\\" classes teaching in German; * developing an active participation of the teaching staff, and especially the director, in the work of the Creative Schools Association; * dissemination of TST teaching innovations in the region of Bydgoszcz. Since the 1990s, the High School N¬∞6 trusts high rankings in Polish competitions (and UNESCO's, Olympiads). Almost every year, it occupies the second place in the regional ranking and the first place in Bydgoszcz. In 1999 was established the Gimnazjum N¬∞. 50, as an institution within the VIth High School, and three years later (2002) the High School Ensemble N¬∞6 () was established, associating both institutions. For school year 2007/2008, ZSO nr 6 opened \\"academic\\" classes, teamed with University of Technology and Life Sciences in Bydgoszcz. On December 21, 2009, the rector of Kazimierz Wielki University in Bydgoszcz (UKW) signed a cooperation agreement to create another academic class with ZSO nr 6. Classes of the Junior High School, focused on sciences (mathematics, informatics, natural sciences) participate in activities conducted by researchers of the University. Gradually, ZSO nr6 became an institution geared towards science subjects. Another innovative idea was the creation, in 2010/2011, of interdisciplinary classes in small groups (\\"Clubs\\") on Edward de Bono's concept. They coexisted with four other clubs: Economics, Humanities, Mathematics and Sciences, realizing cross-curricular activities. Those classes in clubs, developed in collaboration with UKW Department of Psychology, are thought to develop creativity, critical thinking and improve problem-solving skills. In school year 2015/2016, a polytechnic class was created, focusing on mathematics, physics and computer science, in cooperation with Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ (), Gda≈Ñsk and Universities of Technology. ZSO nr 6 keeps promoting its educational offer in relation with scientific institutions in the region, such as: * UKW Institute of Mechanics and Applied Informatics (in Copernicanum building); * The Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ; * The Faculty of Medicine Ludwik Rydygier in Bydgoszcz. The aim is to enable students to develop skills of creative research in scientific fields. Kopernika Street  Activities  High School N¬∞6 is a member of the eTwinning community of schools. eTwinning is an initiative of the European Commission aiming to encourage European schools to collaborate using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by providing the necessary infrastructure (online tools, services, support) to teaching staff. Teachers regularly take part to the Erasmus + programme. In 2015/2016, 18 members of the staff travelled in Europe to broaden their knowledge and hone their skills. Every year, students get prepared for International Science Olympiads in 20 different topics, with recurring success. In addition, pupils take part to various competitions, such as * KFA Klaps, a national contest of amateurs films; * Chemical contest for first classes of High School; * Konkursy Kuratora O≈õwiaty dla Gimnazjalist√≥w for High School students; * \\"Struggles with genetics\\" - for High school first grade; * Musketeers of words.

Architecture  The footprint of the ZSO nr6 occupies an entire block, between the following streets: Staszica, Lucjana Szenwalda, Kopernika and W≈Çadys≈Çawa Reymonta. The plot comprises the building itself, but also outdoor sporting facilities (e.g. basketball and football pitches). The main building has a L shape, with its main facade giving onto Staszica street. The edifice displays late Eclectic features and is registered since 1992 on the Kuyavian- Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list.N¬∞601432, reg. A/989, May 28, 1991 It is often associated with the neighbouring Copernicanum building, erected a few years earlier (1905-1906), also focused on pedagogical purposes. The 4-storey elevation on Staszica street presents two avant-corps topped with both different gables. On the right, the main entrance is accessible via a few stairs, flanked by two hand rails adorned with sculpted festooned urns. The arche shaped portal boasts round shape transom lights. At street level, openings are round-topped, with a bulging corner stone. Upper floors display balustrades on the avant-corps, separated by festoon motifs from the level above. The latter is crowned by garland decoration and bossage pediments. The last level is set up in the Mansard roof, pierced by many dormer. On the top of the roof stands an observation terrace, and a massive ridge turret crowns the right avant-corps. At the corner of the edifice, wedged between the two wings, stands a modest building, presenting a modest turret ended by a tented roof onion dome. The elevation on W≈Çadys≈Çawa Reymonta street displays a first part as rich as the other facade, especially with three peak windows on the last floor, enriched with large floral motifs pediments. This piece is also topped by a ridge turret. Other building fractions along the street are less massive, with less architectural details. They house, among others, the gym hall. Interiors decoration comprises pillars, friezes, stuccoes, vault arches and a large examination hall.

Early years and education Mary Adaline Edwarda Carter was born in Hinesburg, Vermont. She was the oldest child of Edward H. and Mary Adaline Kellogg Carter. Her parents were natives of Vermont, descended from the early New England settlers, of English and Scotch origin. Her early education was chiefly from nature and object study. At the age of eight, she attended private and public schools in Burlington, Vermont, and in Vineland, New Jersey, where her family removed in 1866. The years of country life spent in southern New Jersey during her youth were filled with formative influences that laid a broad and sound basis for her lifework. Circumstances and environments led Carter to finding occupations for herself, or to having them given her, that promoted inventive and executive powers and stimulated love for science and art. Thirst for larger opportunities and higher education developed, but adversities came, overwork, intense mental strain, then long and severe illness. After health was restored, she was by degrees led to industrial art as her vocation. Though beset by obstacles that would have turned aside one of less resoluteness, her course was progressive and largely successful. With simply the intention of becoming proficient as a teacher of drawing, she entered the Woman's Art School, Cooper Union, New York City. Career After graduating with highest honors, in 1876, her services were immediately required as a designer for embroidery. While thus engaged, part of her time was still devoted to art study, and throughout her years of working, she was a constant student in art and other educational subjects. In the Centennial Exhibition, in 1876, she made a special study of the needlework, art embroideries and textiles of all countries. Not long after, her watercolor studies from nature attracted the notice of John Bennett (1840-1907), the English painter of art-pottery, and she became his pupil and assistant. In 1879, a number of pieces of faience decorated by her were sent by invitation to the exhibition of Howell James & Co., London, England. One of her vases was presented to Sir Frederic Leighton, president of the Royal Academy, and others were sold to art museums in England, to be kept as examples of American art pottery. The same year, some of her work in faience was shown in New York, and won much praise. When the Associated Artists began their united enterprise which did much in revolutionizing and elevating household taste and interior decoration of American home and public buildings, Carter's services were secured by Louis Tiffany, and she was connected with them several years. At first having to do with all the kinds of work undertaken, glass, mosaics, metals, wood, embroideries, hangings, wall and ceiling coverings, painting or anything else decoratively used in buildings, she was the first woman thus employed. Later, having developed marked ability in plastic art, she had special charge of their pottery and modeling department. Her ornamental relief-work, panels and friezes were often used with heads and figures by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and combined with work by Charles Caryl Coleman, Maitland Armstrong and other well known artists in the decoration of public and private buildings in New York and different parts of the country. Her designs for memorial and other windows, for decoration of interiors and for different purposes were used in churches and homes, on both east and west coasts. =Instructor= Frequently, artists, draughtsmen, teachers and others sought instruction from her in special subjects. At different times, she taught classes of children in drawing, and in the Woman's Art School one in porcelain painting. Since 1886, she was instructor of the free classes in clay-modeling, applied design and normal training in form-study and drawing for the Young Woman's Christian Association of New York. The courses of study in those classes and all accessories were planned and carried out by her. Personal life From about 1880, Carter resided with her family in the upper suburban part of New York City. She was a staunch member of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

It is made up of bands of subalpine forest and meadow that are created when deep snow and wind forces trees to grow only in bands, about twenty feet wide and thirty feet apart, that have enough shelter. Areas that have this habitat type include the southern Mount Zirkel Wilderness and the Medicine Bow Mountains. Not surprisingly, these areas get some of the Southern Rockies' largest amounts of snow. The area between Mad Creek and Buffalo Pass in the southern Park Range has Colorado's highest amount of snowfall, averaging 25 to 30 feet per winter.  Russia  Kulunda Steppes, Altai Krai.

Language The Anƒìwan language, also known as Nganyaywana has been classified by Robert M. W. Dixon as belonging to the Djan-gadi/Nganjaywana subgroup of Central New South Wales, and was one of three varieties of the group, the other dialects being Himberrong and Inuwon. For a long time Anƒìwan was regarded, like Mbabaram, as a linguistic isolate, ostensibly failing to fit into the known Australian patterns of language, since the material in word-lists taken down of its vocabulary appeared to lack cognates in contiguous languages such as Gamilaraay. The status of its seeming irregularity was solved in 1976 by Terry Crowley who showed that the differences were caused by initial consonant loss which, once accounted for, yielded up over 100 cognate terms between Anƒìwan and other languages and dialects of the region. One of the peculiarities generated by this phenomenon of initial loss was that many homophones were created between originally distinct words, so that in Anƒìwan the word for goanna and bull ant became identical (janda). Country The Aniwan tribe occupied much of the New England area in New South Wales According to Norman Tindale, the Anƒìwan's traditional lands measured some , spreading over the New England tableland from Guyra and Ben Lomond south to Uralla and the Moonbi Range. Northwest their borders ran to Tingha, and encompassed also Bendemeer and Armidale. Neighbouring tribes were the Baanbay to their east; the Djangadi to the south- east, the Yugambal and Ngarabal to their north, and the Gamilaraay to the west. Social structure The Anƒìwan consisted of several clans, one of which was the Himberrong horde. Their section names were: * Irong feminine Arkan * Arpong feminine Iran * Iyong feminine Patjang * Imbong feminine Irakena. The Irong intermarried with the Iyong, and the Arpong with the Imbong. History By the time R. H. Mathews began to record elements of the Anƒìwan language in 1903, remnants of the original tribe had been widely dispersed over New England. Those who remained in Armidale lived on a site on the town fringes known as \\"The Dump\\", in humpies built close to the rubbish tip, which were devoid of the basic amenities of water, sewerage and electricity, and jerry- rigged by using hessian bags, corrugated sheet iron and cardboard boxes. In 1960 4 children died and 11 were hospitalized from infections picked up in conditions that were called \\"appalling\\". The government then allocated funds to clean up the area and built cottages in fibro cement for its residents. Eventually, these were replaced by brick units in a settlement which the local Aboriginal community named Narwan.

Though some aspects of its accuracy have been questioned since then, it is widely used today, especially by SAD researchers. TOC Description The SPAQ is a screening instrument for seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a recurrent major depressive disorder that typically affects its victims during the fall and winter months. It was first developed by American psychiatrist Norman E. Rosenthal and his National Institute of Mental Health colleagues in 1984, and continues to be widely used. It is a self- administered paper-and-pencil test that is freely available in the public domain. The SPAQ can be downloaded. The questionnaire asks subjects to score the amounts of seasonal changes they have experienced in sleep, socialization, mood, weight, appetite and energy. A global score between 0 and 24 is gotten by adding up the scores on each of these items. Subjects also specify the months during which these changes are greatest and least. Subjects are also asked rate their overall seasonal impairment from \\"no problem\\" to \\"disabling\\". Subjects are often taught how to interpret their scores, and cautioned that a self-assessment can never substitute for a clinical evaluation. If their score on the SPAQ is high, they are advised to consult their physician. Reliability, validity, and specificity Numerous studies have been done to assess the usefulness of the test. In general, it has been found to be reliable (in that it yields consistent measurements) and valid (in that it measures what it purports to measure). It has also been found to have low specificity (in that people who have other forms of depression can score as if they have SAD). This could give misleadingly high estimates of the prevalence of SAD. Some studies have questioned the overall validity of the SPAQ, and even the concept of SAD itself. In spite of its shortcomings, the SPAQ is still a very popular screening tool in SAD research. This is true because of its early development, historically wide dissemination, and the absence of better-validated alternatives.

Persistent low density, high turnover of residents, and female philopatry may be responsible for hindering its range expansion, but stressors such as poaching and increasing landscape fragmentation in the Western Carpathians have exacerbated this issue.

He was an Indian Administrative Service officer of Assam-Meghalaya cadre. He was the first person from Assam to be directly recruited to the IAS as well as the first Scheduled Tribe IAS officer in India when he cleared the civil services examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission in 1954.. He belongs to the Biate tribe of Northeast India. Early life and education Jamchonga Nampui (2 June 1926 ‚Äì 2 November 1988) was born in Thuruk, a medium size Biate village in present-day Meghalaya which was then a part of Assam, to Somlalkhupa and Roichongbuangi Nampui. Jamchonga was the eldest of seven brothers and two sisters in his family. Two years after his birth, his parents moved to Mualdam, a village in North Cachar Hills (Dima Hasao) where he spent his childhood days. In 1935, as there was no school in Mualdam his father took him to Haflong where he was enrolled in Haflong Welsh Mission L.P. School (now Government Boys Higher Secondary School) in the same year. From his school years, Jamchonga was a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. In 1942, after passing Middle Class (Class VI), he was sent for further studies to Shillong (the then capital of Assam) as Haflong during those days didn't have any school that provided higher studies beyond Class VI. In Shillong, he got admitted to the Government High School, Mawkhar. During this period, particularly during 1945-46, young Jamchonga was actively involved in freedom movement activities against the British Raj, at a time when the demand for freedom was at its greatest strength in the country. This zeal, however, affected his studies and as a result, he could not clear his matriculation examination in 1946. Jamchonga returned to Haflong in 1946 where he stayed till 1950 doing several jobs to earn a living. Although he was now earning, his love for education and learning didn't die. So he decided to give the matriculation examination again in 1950 from Government English High School (now Government Boys Higher Secondary School) and this time he passed the exam with a first division. He then moved to Shillong again and took admission in St. Anthony's College . During this period, he used to work as a clerk in the Governor's Secretariat during the day and attend night classes. In spite of many odds, he passed his Bachelor of Arts (BA) with distinction from St. Anthony's College securing the overall rank of 8th position under Gauhati University in 1954. After his graduation, he decided to sit for the civil services examination and in his very first attempt cleared the examination securing a merit ranking of 64th position and was selected for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Career Jamchonga Nampui first posting as a civil servant was as Assistant Commissioner, Naga Hills of undivided Assam on 2 May 1956 on probation. In a career spanning 32 years, he went on to serve as Assistant Commissioner, Lakhimpur and Sivasagar districts, Deputy Commissioner of Mizo Hills (now Mizoram) and Cachar districts and also as Commissioner, Transport and Commissioner, Excise, Assam. He then went on to become Chairman, M.S.E.B, Meghalaya, Joint Secretary, Revenue and Forest Department, Assam and subsequently Secretary to the Government of India, Information & Broadcasting, New Delhi. He was appointed twice as the Chief Secretary of Meghalaya in 1980 (13.05.1980 - 26.08.1983) and then again in 1985 (1.07.1985 - 19.08.1985). After this, Jamchonga was then appointed as the Chief Secretary of Assam (14.02.1986 - 01.11.1986), a post he held till his retirement. He retired on 1 November 1986. He was, however, appointed again as Honorarium in Vice Chairman, State Hills Areas Planning Board with the status of Minister of State for a brief period after his retirement by the Government of Assam. Death Shortly after he retired from service, Jamchonga Nampui died on 2 November 1988 at his residence \\"Ivory Cottage\\" in Mawkhar, Shillong. Personal life Jamchonga was the eldest of seven brothers and two sisters born to Somlalkhupa and Roichongbuangi Nampui. Other notable siblings include Luaia Nampui, a retired Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer who now resides in Guwahati. Jamchonga Nampui married Minne.E. Nampui in 1954. They have two sons and three daughters. One of his daughters, Merrylin Nellie Nampui is also today an IAS officer. Commemoration To honor Jamchonga Nampui and to take forward his legacy \\"to strive for the best in education\\", a school in Fiangpui, Assam, District Council L.P. School, established in 1962, was renamed as J.C. Nampui Memorial L.P. School in 1990 after him.

The department was also formed when Overland Park became a \\"first class city\\". Tragedy first affected the Overland Park Police Department on January 19, 1968, when a Kansas Highway Patrol Sergeant, Eldon K. Miller, was shot and killed in Overland Park. The incident began with a bank robbery in Overland Park and during the robbery an Overland Park Police motorcycle officer was wounded and the suspects were then found in an apartment complex when officers found the getaway vehicle used in the robbery. Following the discovery officers set up a perimeter around the apartment complex and Trooper Miller hopped in a Johnson County Sheriff's Office patrol car and used the patrol car to cover other officers from gunfire, as he was moving the vehicle the suspects started shooting and gunfire hit Trooper Miller in the head killing him immediately. The suspects were arrested and sent to prison. Two Overland Park officers have been killed in the line of duty. Officer Deanna S. Rose was killed on January 6, 1985, when she was in the process of attempting to arrest an underage male for driving while drunk. As she tried to arrest him he knocked her down and got in his car and ran her over; she died two days later. He was later arrested for the crime and went to prison but was eventually released. She was the first female police officer killed in the state of Kansas. On May 4, 2020, Officer Michael Mosher was killed after he witnessed a hit and run and pursued the vehicle involved. Following a brief chase, Officer Mosher and the suspect exchanged gunfire, and both died as a result.

She was one of the first women to open a photographic studio, located at 6, Alcaiceria Street in Mexico City. At the time, there were 30 women photographers in Mexico, in comparison to the hundreds of women working as photographers in the United States. The Mexican historiography has considered her one of the first Mexican photographers. Shanti Lesur, Baquedano's niece great-granddaughter, has made an independent effort to rescue and study the work of this photographer. The Shanti Lesur Archive is at the moment the most complete source of original materials. During 2007, Shanti Lesur organized an exhibition about the work of this photographer in the Cuauhnahuac Regional Museum, located in the Palace of Cortes, in the city of Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. As Bartra and Monroy have pointed out, the case of Baquedano is relevant since she preferred to study and work than becoming, as the great majority of women on her time, to become a mother and a wife. She opened one of the first studios where women worked in Mexico. She also created innovative photographic processes. Biography Bartra points out that Baquedano was born in the city of Quer√©taro in 1872. Her parents were Francisco Baquedano, owner of a food packing plant, and Isabel Hurtado, who had four other daughters. Rodr√≠guez indicates that Baquedano began her artistic training at the city of Quer√©taro \\"under Direction of Mr. Almaraz in the fields of drawing, painting and sculpture.\\" Monroy points out that Baquedano became independent from her family when she was young, traveling and establishing herself in Mexico City to enter the National Art School, probably between 1895 And 1897, something really atypical at the end of the 19th century. Both Bartra and Rodr√≠guez provide data concerning the photographic study founded and operated by Natalia Baquedano: the first states that it was located on Calle Alcacer√≠a No. 6, corner of \\"5 de Mayo\\", and the second that it was opened in 1898 along with a partner, A Rico, under the name National Photography. In addition to these biographical data, it is known that Baquedano did not marry or have any children, and that she died in 1936 at the age of 64. Work Both Bartra and Rodriguez point out that Baquedano was mainly devoted to portrait. Rodr√≠guez cites an announcement of National Photography that indicated the type of work done in this one: \\"photography on platinum paper, albumin, silk, porcelain, metal and everything that can be applied photographs. - Illuminations on oil mirrors and watercolor. - Portraits, views and groups outside the workshop. Conventional prices. Amplifications of all sizes, direct or taken from any portrait, however small, guaranteed the likeness.\\" (Rodr√≠guez, op. cit). This document also announced a \\"Newness\\": the\\" photograph on natural flowers\\", an invention of Baquedano, which won her a celebrity, patenting it in her name and giving Carmen Romero Rubio de Diaz (wife of the Mexican President at the time) a bouquet of flowers with this ephemeral art. Rodriguez mentions that her work was \\"on the tone of his contemporaries\\". In his publication, there is one reproduction of one of Baquedano's studio photographs: a group portrait of the Founding Commission of the Astronomical Society of Mexico, ca. 1900. Both Rodr√≠guez and Bartra point out that, in addition to the individual or group portraits made in the Baquedano photographic studio, the artist also made some similar compositions to appearances \\"that seem taken from everyday life (the image of her parents, elegantly dressed, drinking beer), or merely theatrical (a child sitting on the moon, another as an angel) and even playful compositions. She also made pictures of dead infants, something common at the time, but she would place the body next to a skull. According to Bartra, the Shanti Lesur Archive is composed almost entirely of portraits of the photographer's family, most notably the portraits of her sister Clemencia. Natalia Baquedano is an important source of the female portraits since she had a special predilection of portraying women. What it is outstanding in Baquedano's art is that she does not portrait female characters as it was usually done on her time. The daguerreotypes, nitrocellulose flexible film negatives, glass plates and paper prints, show a playful and not stigmatized universe.  Scholarship on Natalia Baquedano and early women photographers in Mexico  Historians such as Eli Bartra, Rebeca Monroy Nasr and Jos√© Antonio Rodr√≠guez have studied her work. Some articles in different magazines (Pol√≠tica y Cultura, UAM Xochimilco; Alquimia) and article in the book Fot√≥grafos en M√©xico (1872-1960) are the closest to a biography.

It was the conclusion of the comprehensive building contract in the royal spa, which Luitpold of Bavaria had given in 1905 to Max Littmann as \\"special commissioner for the state's new buildings in the royal spa garden\\".Walter Beck: 'Bayern und Sachsen. 2004, p. 245 This order, for which the Bavarian government released funding in 1910, included also the construction of the Wandelhalle (promenade hall) and the renovation and structural integration of the older Arkadenbau of Friedrich von G√§rtner, a 200-meter-long arcade building from 1838 with its hall Conversationssaal (today Rossini-Saal), to the Regentenbau. From the opening until 1918 the Vienna Symphony as the saisonal spa orchestra performed its evening concerts at the Regentenbau. The Munich Philharmonic followed from 1919 to 1942. Then musical life ended because of the Second World War.Thomas Ahnert: Die Kur macht die Musik. In: Thomas Ahnert, Peter Weidisch: 1200 Jahre Bad Kissingen 801-2001. Sonderpublikation des Stadtarchivs Bad Kissingen. Bad Kissingen 2001. p. 336-345. After the war the Regentenbau was occupied by the American troops for two years.https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/05/travel/where-princes- took-the-waters.html Musical life started again in 1950 with the Hofer Symphoniker (until 1979). Since 1986 the Regentenbau is the main location of the festival Kissinger Sommer. From 2003 to 2005 the Regentenbau was completely renovatet.Generalsanierung des Regentenbaus in Bad Kissingen in: Baukultur, No. 5/2007, p. 27f.  The halls  = Max-Littmann-Saal (Max Littmann Hall)= The Max-Littmann-Saal was originally called Gro√üer Saal (Great Hall). After the end of renovation in 2005 it was officially renamed after the architect Max Littmann. The hall of about 455 square meters is 36 meters long, 16 meters high and is surrounded by a large U-shaped gallery. In the case of row seating, the hall accommodates a maximum of 1,160 guests, in the parquet about 660 and on the gallery about 500 seats. It is used for concerts, but also for conferences. Experts count it to the best concert halls of the world.https://www.welt.de/kultur/article160705649/Die-20-schoensten- Konzertsaele-der-Welt.html The paneling of cherry-wood gives the hall, which is of the ‚Äúshoebox type‚Äù, a much acclaimed acoustics. Behind the panelling a gap of five to ten centimeters to the wall acts as resonance space. Measurements during the renovation of 2005 brought reverberation times of 1.1 to 1.8 seconds. These acoustics are similar to the Boston Symphony Hall or the Usher Hall in Edinburgh.http://www.mainpost.de/regional/bad-kissingen/Akustik- Konzertsaele-Usher;art766,7388699 So the Max-Littmann-Saal often was used for recordings of classical music. In the recent past the Philharmonie Festiva and the conductor Gerd Schaller produced CD recordings of symphonic works of Anton Bruckner,http://www.musicweb- international.com/classrev/2015/Aug/Herbeck_mass_PH15003.htm Johannes Brahms, and Franz Schubert,https://www.allmusic.com/performance/3-scherzo-allegro- mq0002072889 as well as the first recordings of the opera Merlin by Carl Goldmarkhttp://classicalsource.com/db_control/db_cd_review.php?id=8315 and the Great Mass by Johann Ritter von Herbeck. Many concerts of the Kissinger Sommer are recorded in the Max-Littmann-Saal by the public broadcasting company Bayerischer Rundfunk. The hall is connected to the neighbouring halls Gr√ºner Saal and Wei√üer Saal by big foldable doors, which make it possible to enlarge the capacity of the Max-Littmann-Saal. =Gr√ºner Saal (Green Hall)= The hall in art nouveau style was thought to be a room for chamber music. It is 21 metters long and 8,5 meters wide and has 120 seats. =Wei√üer Saal (White Hall)= The hall in rokoko style of about 150 square meters and a capacity 100 places is also used for small concerts. On one side it is connected to the Littmann-Saal with three-meters-high mirror doors, while glass doors lead to the Schmuckhof on the other side. =Schmuckhof (Courtyard)= The Schmuckhof, built in the neo-baroque style, is a small inner courtyard between the White Hall, the 150 square meter Salon am Schmuckhof (110 people in rows) and the adjacent reading rooms. It leads to foyer of the Rossini-Saal. =Rossini-Saal (Rossini-Hall)= Littmann transformed the old Conversationssaal (Conversation Hall) of Friedrich von G√§rtner and created an additional stage. It is also used for smaller concerts. 280 people can sit in the hall with its 330 square meters. After the general renovation around the year 2000 the hall was renamed Rossini-Saal after the composer Gioachino Rossini, who has visited Bad Kissingen as a spa guest in 1856.

From 1994 to 2006, he was the chief executive officer of its commercial consulting operations. The company went bankrupt in 2013, and later became known as Monitor Deloitte.

He has published research about dividend policy, income inequality and the skills gap. With Michael C. Jensen, Fuller argued that dividend policy was critical to solving the politics of agency costs between shareholders and senior executives. As a result, they agreed with Richard C. Breeden, the former chairman of the SEC, that companies should give high dividends to their shareholders annually to make sure their investments were based on dynamic capital market returns and avoid wasting resources on unnecessary investments or extravagant compensations. Fuller suggested that educators and employers would have to work together to address the skills gap. With his colleagues Jan W. Rivkin and Karen Mills, Fuller argued that fostering shared prosperity would entail the collective impact of leaders in \\"government, business, education, nonprofits, labor, philanthropy\\" and other sectors. With Matthew Sigelman, Fuller argued that the Trans-Pacific Partnership could not explain high unemployment rates and low wages in the United States; instead, globalization led to a skills gap and the US workforce needed to be retrained to fill new highly skilled jobs. Taking the example of J.P. Morgan, which announced they would train their employees to make sure they could be promoted, Fuller and Sigelman encouraged US companies to do the same, adding that such an investment would foster soft skills. In the wake of Donald Trump's victory, Fuller argued the skills gap would have to be tackled. To do this, Fuller suggested the United States Department of Education should broaden the scope of Pell Grants to enable non-traditional college students in programs co-sponsored by a company to qualify; make it mandatory for colleges to disclose their graduation rates; encourage apprenticeships; review accreditation standards.

It is notable for granting Scottish ministers the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further sustainable development in the absence of a willing seller. Provisions Under the provisions of the Act there is to be a ‚ÄòLand Rights and Responsibilities Statement‚Äô, setting out the Scottish Government‚Äôs objectives for land reform, a Scottish Land Commission is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to tenant farming. A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 and extended by the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015, the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows crofting communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller. Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for Scottish Natural Heritage to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.

The guns were positioned so as to allow any two to fire directly ahead, astern, or to either broadside. The ship's armored belt was thick, with the thicker portion above the waterline and the thinner below. The belt was capped with thick transverse bulkheads at either end. The casemate had heavy armor protection, with the gun battery protected by 150 mm of iron plating. Service history Avnillah was ordered in 1867 and was laid down at the Thames Iron Works in Blackwall, London the following year. She was launched on 21 April 1869; fitting-out work was completed by 1870, when she conducted sea trials before being commissioned later that year. Upon completion, Avnillah and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in the aftermath of the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals. Avnillah was assigned to the II Squadron of the Asiatic Fleet, along with her sister ship and the ironclads and . Early in the ship's career, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was activated every summer for short cruises from the Golden Horn to the Bosporus to ensure their propulsion systems were in operable condition. =Russo-Turkish War= The Ottoman ironclad fleet in the Golden Horn; Avnillah is among the vessels present The Ottoman fleet began mobilizing in September 1876 to begin preparations for a conflict with Russia, as tensions with the country had been growing for several years, an insurrection had begun in Ottoman Bosnia in mid-1875, and Serbia had declared war on the Ottoman Empire in July 1876. In December 1876, Avnillah and her sister ship were transferred to Batumi owing to the increasingly active Russian naval forces in the area. The Russo-Turkish War began on 24 April 1877 with a Russian declaration of war. Avnillah spent the war in the Black Sea squadron, with the bulk of the Ottoman ironclad fleet. The eight ironclads of the Ottoman fleet in the Black Sea, commanded by Hobart, were vastly superior to the Russian Black Sea Fleet; the only ironclads the Russians possessed there were and , circular vessels that had proved to be useless in service, owing to their very low speed and the difficulty in controlling them. The presence of the fleet did force the Russians to keep two corps in reserve for coastal defense, but the Ottoman high command failed to make use of its naval superiority in a more meaningful way, particularly to hinder the Russian advance into the Balkans. Hobart Pasha took the fleet to the eastern Black Sea, where he was able to make a more aggressive use of it to support the Ottoman forces battling the Russians in the Caucasus. The fleet bombarded Poti and assisted in the defense of Batumi. On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Avnillah, Muin-i Zafer, , , , and bombarded Russian positions around the Black Sea port of Sokhumi before landing infantry and arming the local populace to start an uprising against the Russians. The Ottomans captured Sokhumi two days later. Over the course of the war, Russian torpedo boats made several attacks on the vessels stationed in Batumi, but Avnillah was not damaged in any of them. The fleet continued to support the Ottoman garrison at Batumi, when held out against constant Russian attacks to the end of the war. =Later career= Avnillah sunk in Beirut harbor, seen from the air during World War I The ship was laid up in Constantinople in 1878; she did not see further activity for the next twenty years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended. During this period, the ship underwent a slight modernization. In 1882, a pair of breech-loading guns manufactured by Krupp were added. At some point, she also received new Scotch marine boilers, and her brigantine rig was removed, with heavy military masts installed in its place. The Ottomans planned to further strengthen the ship's armament with a pair of Krupp guns, two Hotchkiss revolver cannon, two guns, also manufactured by Hotchkiss, and a torpedo tube, but the plan came to nothing. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Avnillah was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Avnillah, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy, which possessed the three modern s. The ships' guns and armor were long obsolete, and their crews were poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, particularly the British Admiral Henry Wood and the German Admiral Eugen Kalau vom Hofe, who led the inspection. The fleet proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and the inability of the Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, but Avnillah was not included in the program. After further negotiations, Gio. Ansaldo & C. received the contract to rebuild the ship in 1903, with work lasting until 1906. Her old muzzle-loading guns were replaced with new Krupp 40-caliber guns, and a new light battery consisting of six quick-firing (QF) Krupp guns, ten QF Krupp guns, and two QF Krupp guns. Long since obsolete, Avnillah was reduced to a stationary ship based in Beirut in 1910, where she was tasked with providing local defense. By this time, she was armed with only four quick-firing guns. In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. The Italian command was concerned that Avnillah or the torpedo boat , which was also in the harbor, would attack Italian troop transports passing through the Suez Canal, and therefore decided to neutralize the vessels. On the morning of 24 February 1912, two Italian armored cruisers, and arrived off the port and demanded that the two ships be surrendered. At 09:00, having heard no reply from the Ottoman Vali (Governor), the Italian vessels opened fire at a range of . In the ensuing Battle of Beirut, the Italians hit Avnillah and set her on fire; she returned fire against the Italian cruisers but scored no hits. The cruisers then entered the harbor, where Giuseppe Garibaldi fired two torpedoes at Avnillah, the first of which missed and sank six civilian vessels. The second struck her amidships and sank her in the shallow water. Casualty estimates range from two officers and forty-nine enlisted men killed to three officers and fifty-five men killed in the sinking. A further eight officers and a hundred men were injured.

On 14 May 1877, an Ottoman squadron consisting of Muin-i Zafer, Avnillah, , , , and bombarded Russian positions around the Black Sea port of Sokhumi before landing infantry and arming the local populace to start an uprising against the Russians. The Ottomans captured Sokhumi two days later. By June, Muin-i Zafer had been transferred to Sulina at the mouth of the Danube, along with the ironclads and . The ships were tasked with defending the seaward approach to the port, supporting three coastal fortifications. =Later career= The Ottoman ironclad fleet in the Golden Horn; Muin-i Zafer is among the vessels present After the end of the war in 1878, the ship was laid up in Constantinople; she did not see further activity for the next twenty years. The annual summer cruises to the Bosporus ended after the war. During this period, the ship was modernized slightly. In 1882, a pair of breech-loading guns manufactured by Krupp were added. At some point, she also received new Scotch marine boilers, and her brigantine rig was removed, with heavy military masts installed in its place. The Ottomans planned to further strengthen the ship's armament with a pair of Krupp guns, two Hotchkiss revolver cannon, two guns, also manufactured by Hotchkiss, and a torpedo tube, but the plan came to nothing. By the mid-1880s, the Ottoman ironclad fleet was in poor condition, and Muin-i Zafer was unable to go to sea. Many of the ships' engines were unusable, having seized up from rust, and their hulls were badly fouled. The British naval attache to the Ottoman Empire at the time estimated that the Imperial Arsenal would take six months to get just five of the ironclads ready to go to sea. Throughout this period, the ship's crew was limited to about one-third the normal figure. During a period of tension with Greece in 1886, the fleet was brought to full crews and the ships were prepared to go to sea, but none actually left the Golden Horn, and they were quickly laid up again. By that time, most of the ships were capable of little more than . At the start of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans inspected the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including Muin-i Zafer, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Many of the ships had rotted hulls and their crews are poorly trained. Through April and May, the Ottoman fleet made several sorties into the Aegean Sea in an attempt to raise morale among the ships' crews, though the Ottomans had no intention of attacking Greek forces. The condition of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which proved to be an embarrassment for the government and finally forced Sultan Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. Following a lengthy process of negotiations, Krupp received the contract to rebuild Muin-i Zafer on 11 August 1900, along with several other warships. By December 1902, however, Krupp withdrew from the deal and the Italian firm Gio. Ansaldo & C. took over the project. By 1906, the work was completed. Her old muzzle-loading guns were replaced with new Krupp 40-caliber guns, and a new light battery consisting of six quick- firing (QF) Krupp guns, ten QF Krupp guns, and two QF Krupp guns. Muin-i Zafer was reduced to a stationary ship in ƒ∞zmir in 1910, at which point her armament was reduced to just two of the 75 mm guns and four 57 mm guns. In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. At the start of the war, Muin-i Zafer was stationed as a guard ship in Beirut. She left shortly after the onset of hostilities, however, and on 30 September arrived in Port Said at the northern end of the Suez Canal. There, she was disarmed and her guns were taken ashore to strengthen the local defenses. By the start of the First Balkan War in October 1912, Muin-i Zafer had been moved back to ƒ∞zmir.In 1913, she became a torpedo training ship based in Constantinople. The ship was converted into a floating barracks in 1920 stationed in ƒ∞zmit. In 1928, the vessel was converted again, into a depot ship for submarines at Erdek. She served in that capacity for four years before being decommissioned in 1932; she was broken up for scrap in 1934.

About long, it drains an area of the high Sierra Nevada about northeast of Fresno. Course The South Fork begins at Martha Lake, above sea level, near Mount Goddard in the northern section of Kings Canyon National Park in Fresno County. It flows northwest through the narrow Goddard Canyon, receiving Evolution Creek from the east, then leaves the park at the confluence with Piute Creek from the north, entering the Sierra National Forest. It then flows west, through Blayney Meadows, into Florence Lake, impounded by Florence Lake Dam. Below the dam it flows briefly north, receiving Bear Creek, before turning west again, through a wider valley past Mono Hot Springs then receiving its main tributary, Mono Creek, from the north. The South Fork enters the Ansel Adams Wilderness as it turns northwest, receiving Four Forks and Rube Creeks before crossing into Madera County. Soon after entering Madera County, it joins the San Joaquin River, in a deep granite canyon below Balloon Dome at San Joaquin river mile 334 (km 537), a short distance above Mammoth Pool Reservoir. River modifications The Florence Lake Dam, as well as Vermillion Valley Dam on Mono Creek which forms Lake Thomas A. Edison, are both part of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project operated by Southern California Edison to provide electricity to Los Angeles. In 1925, water was first diverted from the South Fork via the Ward Tunnel into Huntington Lake. The concrete multiple-arch Florence Lake dam was completed in 1926 to ensure a year-round water supply for the tunnel. The larger, earthen Vermillion Valley Dam was built much later, in 1953. The dams divert a considerable amount of water from the South Fork for power generation, especially during the late summer and fall when water flows are already naturally low. Recreation The South Fork between Piute Creek and Florence Lake has a wide variety of difficulty levels for boating, ranging from a gentle, smooth meandering stream in the Blayney Meadows section to continuous Class VI to V+ whitewater in the last above Florence Lake, as well as a number of waterfalls that must be portaged. Below the Florence Lake Dam river flows are less reliable due to water diversions, except in years of particularly heavy snowmelt.

She showed considerable promise as a two-year-old in 2002, winning a maiden race and being placed in the Debutante Stakes and the Rockfel Stakes before taking the Eyrefield Stakes. In the following spring she won the Irish 1000 Guineas and appeared an unlucky loser when narrowly beaten in The Oaks. She failed to win again but finished placed in the Prix Vermeille, Prix de l'Op√©ra and the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf. Background Yesterday is a bay mare with a broad white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by Premier Bloodstock, a breeding company owned by John Magnier of the Coolmore Stud and Richard Henry. During her racing career she was owned by Susan Magnier and Richard Henry's wife Roisin and was trained at Ballydoyle by Aidan O'Brien. She was ridden in most of her races by Mick Kinane. She was from the fifteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Yesterday's dam Jude showed little ability as a racehorse, failing to win in four starts before being sold to Premier Bloodstock for 92,000 guineas as a three-year-old. She made more impact as a broodmare, with her other foals including Quarter Moon (second in The Oaks) and All My Loving (third in the Epsom Oaks). Several of Jude's foals were named in reference to Beatles songs: apart from Yesterday (\\"Yesterday\\") and All My Loving (\\"All My Loving\\") they included Magicalmysterytour (\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\") and Betterbetterbetter (from the lyric of \\"Hey Jude\\"). Jude's dam Alruccaba was an influential broodmare whose other descendants have included Alborada, Allegretto (Prix Royal Oak), Aussie Rules (Poule d'Essai des Poulains) and Albanova (Preis von Europa). Racing career =2002: two- year-old season= Yesterday began her racing career in the Listed Fillies' Sprint Stakes at Naas Racecourse on 3 June in which she finished eighth of the eleven runners behind the British challenger Rag Top. Later that month she started 1/2 favourite for a seven furlong maiden race at Tipperary Racecourse an won \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from Encircle. The filly was then stepped up in class and started 5/4 favourite for the Group Three Debutante Stakes at the Curragh in August but was beaten into second by the 14/1 outsider Rainbows For All. After a break of almost two month Yesterday was sent to France for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 6 October. After turning into the straight in third place she was outpaced in the closing stages and finished sixth of the ten runners behind Six Perfections. Less than two weeks later she appeared at Newmarket Racecourse in England to contest the Rockfel Stakes and finished third behind Luvah Girl and Casual Look. On her final appearance of the year Yesterday was matched against male opposition in the Listed Eyrefield Stakes over nine furlongs on heavy ground at Leopardstown Racecourse on 10 November. Starting the 6/4 favourite in an eighteen-runner field she took the lead a furlong from the finish and accelerated away from her rivals to win \\"easily\\" by four lengths. Her win meant that Kinane clinched his 12th Irish Champion Jockey title. =2003: three-year-old season= Yesterday began her second season in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 4 May in which she started a 20/1 outsider and finished eighth of the nineteen runners as Russian Rhythm won from Six Perfections, Intercontinental and Soviet Song. Three weeks later at the Curragh Yesterday was one of eight fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas and started the 11/2 second choice in the betting behind Six Perfections who was made the odds-on favourite. The other runners included Walayef (Round Tower Stakes, Athasi Stakes), Dimitrova (Leopardstown 1,000 Guineas Trial Stakes), Luminata (Silver Flash Stakes) and Cat Belling (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). Yesterday raced in fourth place as L'Ancresse set the pace before Dimitrova went to the front two furlongs from the finish. She overtook Dimitrova inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of Six Perfections to win by a short head. The runner-up appeared somewhat unfortunate as her jockey Johnny Murtagh was unable to obtain a clear run until the final strides. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"Mick's ride was perfection. Yesterday stops when she hits the front but he couldn't wait any longer than he did. She goes on fast ground but she does like an ease. She will go for the Oaks\\". Kinane said, \\"Some days the luck bounces for you and some days it doesn't. Johnny found himself in one of those positions today. But in fairness to Yesterday, she did everything right\\". On 6 June Yesterday was moved up in distance and started 100/30 favourite for the 225th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse. After being restrained in the early stages she attempted to move into contention in the straight but was repeatedly blocked and hampered before obtaining a clear run inside the final furlong. She finished strongly but failed by a neck to peg back Casual Look, appearing to be an unlucky loser. The Irish Times's correspondent stated that she was \\"clearly the best filly in the race\\". In the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 13 July she started the 11/8 favourite but finished fourth behind Vintage Tipple, L'Ancresse and Casual Look. After a late summer break Yesterday was sent to France for the Group One Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 14 September. Ridden by Jamie Spencer she turned into the straight in fifth place and stayed on well but failed by a head to overhaul the Godolphin filly Mezzo Soprano. The filly was matched against older fillies and mares when she returned to Longchamp for the Prix de l'Op√©ra over 2000 metres on 5 October. She was held up at the back of the field before making a strong late run and finished second, beaten a head by the British-trained four-year-old Zee Zee Top with Bright Sky (winner of the race in 2002) a neck away in third. Yesterday was then sent to America for the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf at Santa Anita Park on 25 October in which she stayed on from the rear of the field to finish third behind Islington and L'Ancresse. =2004: four-year-old season= Yesterday remained in training as a four-year-old and was ridden by Spencer in all three of her starts. After an absence of more than ten months she returned in the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown on 11 September and finished fifth of the six runners behind Soviet Song. She then ran for the second time in the Prix de l'Op√©ra and finished fourth behind Alexander Goldrun. She ended her racing career with a second attempt at the Breeders Cup Filly & Mare Turf at Lone Star Park on 30 October and finished fifth behind Ouija Board in a twelve-runner field. Breeding record Yesterday was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Premier Bloodstock. She has produced si foals and two winners: *Bishop of Derry, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 2006, sired by Giant's Causeway.

Naomi Siegler Savage (June 25, 1927 ‚Äì November 22, 2005) was an American photographer. Early life and education Born Naomi Siegler, she was a native of Princeton, New Jersey. Her parents were Samuel Siegler and Elsie Siegler (n√©e Radnitzky), a sister of Man Ray. She first studied photography under Berenice Abbott at the New School for Social Research in 1943, following this with studies in art, photography, and music at Bennington College from 1944 until 1947. The next year she spent in California with her uncle, studying his techniques. In 1950 she married the architect and sculptor David Savage, with whom she moved to Paris, living there for some years. Career During her career Savage received an award from the Cassandra Foundation in 1970, and a photography fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1971. In 1976 she received the silver award from the Art Directors Club. Later in life, Savage returned to live in Princeton, where she died. Savage was heavily influence by her uncle, Man Ray, prompting her to experiment with the medium of photography, combining traditional techniques with more unusual processes, including some of her own design. She worked extensively with photogravure and photoengraving, transforming these mechanical printing techniques to be used for aesthetic effects rather than duplication. Unlike many photographers, Savage considered the metal plate that photographs are etched on to be a work of art in its own right. She pioneered the use of using the photographic metal plate to produce a three dimensional form with a metallic surface. Savage explored variations in color and texture in her work often by using inked and intaglio relief prints. Many of her works were created by combining media such as collage, negative images, texture screening, multiple exposure, photograms, solarization, toning, printing on metallic foils. Her works focus on a variety of subject matter and imagery, which has included portraits, landscapes, human figures, mannequins, masks, toys, kitchen utensils, dental and ophthalmological equipment. Legacy Several of her pieces are owned by the Museum of Modern Art, and she is represented as well in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the International Center for Photography, the Fogg Art Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the Madison Art Center. A photoengraved mural depicting the life of Lyndon Baines Johnson is a centerpiece of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.

Naturalist Warsavia Physice Illustrata (1730) De flora Japonica, Codice bibliothecae Regiae Berolinensis rarissi was published by Erndel in Dresden in 1716. Thereafter, he moved to Warsaw. Parallel to caring for the monarch's health, Erndel ran a private practice in Warsaw and carried out research in to nature. Apart from his general description of the city, his special area of interest was the flora in the vicinity of Warsaw, especially those on the banks of the Vistula. He collated and published his many years of observations and descriptions of nature in his book, printed in Dresden in 1730, Warsavia Physice Illustrata, Sive De Aere, Aquis, Locis Et Incolis Warsaviae, Eorundemque Moribus Et Morbis Tractatus ; Cui Annexum Est Viridarium, Vel Catalogus Plantarum Circa Warsaviam Nascentium Warsavia physice illustrata: sive, De aere, aquis, locis et incolis Warsaviae, eorundemque moribus tractatus.

Warsavia Physice illustrata was the first ever treatise on this subject. The index to plants which Erndel created included more than 900 species. One of the passages concerns the first documented palaeontological studies, which he performed on the banks of the Vistula. The fossils of prehistoric animals that were discovered then, were sent to Dresden, where they formed the core of one of the collections displayed in the Zwinger Palace. He also described his experiences in Warsaw in the accompaniment of August the Strong. In 1733 Erndel published De plantis circa thermos Teplicenes crescentibus, in the third volume of the Processes of the Academy of the Curiosity of Nature, a catalogue of plants growing in the vicinity of Teplice in Bohemia.  First Meteorologist in Warsaw  Warsaw Meteorological Data, January 1725 Erndel was also the first to introduce systematic weather observations in Warsaw. The daily measurements listed by him for air pressure, temperature, wind and clouds during the four-year period from 1725 to 1728, were the first statistics of this nature in the history of the city.http://www.sb-verlag.de/programm/070/PDFs/Warschau-104-107.pdf  Demise  Erndel left Warsaw in 1730, returning to his place of birth, Dresden.

Thompson (born 1985) is a former American journalist who was later convicted for cyberstalking and making several bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers in the U.S. Personal background Thompson is a native of St. Louis, Missouri. He attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was connected to the student newspaper. However, Thompson failed to graduate. He was a summer intern with DNAinfo Chicago and an intern for a WBEZ talk show for four months. In November 2016, Thompson announced plans to run for mayor of St. Louis, but failed to raise money in an online campaign, only raising $25 from a single donation. Reporting scandal and termination from The Intercept Thompson was a staff reporter for The Intercept, but was fired in February 2016 for fabricating quotes and attributions in news articles. This included a false claim, purportedly made by a cousin of Dylann Roof, that Roof was motivated to commit the Charleston church shooting because a former love interest chose black men over Roof. A note from editor Betsy Reed indicated that Thompson had been fired recently after his editors discovered \\"a pattern of deception\\" in his reporting. According to Reed, he had \\"fabricated several quotes in his stories and created fake email accounts that he used to impersonate people, one of which was a Gmail account in my name\\". The site's investigation into Thompson's reporting had found that he had, on multiple occasions, attributed quotes to people who said he had not interviewed them or did not remember him doing so, people whom they could not reach to verify the quote or whose identity could not be confirmed. In the retracted story, Roof's family said they did not know of a cousin whom Thompson had quoted as saying Roof's interest in white supremacy took off after a woman to whom he was attracted began dating a black man. He also used \\"quotes that we cannot verify from unnamed people whom he claimed to have encountered at public events\\". To prevent his fabrications from being discovered, she continued, he lied to editors about how he had gotten the quotes, and in one case created an email account in the name of one of his sources. When editors discovered his actions, she added, he stood by his published work and, while admitting to creating the email accounts, refused to assist in the review otherwise. In an email to Reed he shared with various news outlets, Thompson said he was being treated for testicular cancer and for that reason had not had access to his notes when the site had asked to review them. He explained his methods as \\"writing drafts of stories, placing the names of [people] I wanted to get quotes from in there, and then going to fetch the quotes ... If I couldn't obtain a quote from the person I wanted, I went somewhere else, and must've forgot to change the names‚Äîclearly.\\" While he admitted this was \\"sloppy\\", he faulted The Intercept for lacking \\"a sustained and competent editor to guide me,\\" alluding to the site's managerial turnovers. He also claimed that the greater problem was racism in the media field, that he made up pseudonyms for some of his sources because they were \\"poor black people who didn't want their names in the public given the situations\\" and who would not have spoken with a reporter otherwise, and that he had felt a need to \\"exaggerate my personal shit in order to prove my worth\\" at The Intercept given incidents of racial bias he said he had witnessed there. When Gawker published his email, Reed said those allegations had not been in the version he sent her. After the note was published, the site amended Thompson's online biography when an editor at a Chicago public radio station said that while Thompson had indeed worked there, he had no involvement in the station's news reporting as he had claimed. His past tenure at DNAinfo in Chicago, where one editor tweeted in response to the story that she could have seen it coming, was also edited out. He was fired by The Intercept in early 2016, and according to Reed, did not cooperate into the investigation of his actions. Post-termination Following his termination from The Intercept, a reporter from The Riverfront Times documented Thompson's history of ethical breaches in his job. This reportedly prompted Thompson to harass the reporter. He first attempted to get him fired, then set up a series of fake social media accounts in which he claimed the reporter was a rapist. The accounts were later shut down by investigators. On July 7, 2016, Thompson posted a 5,000-word essay in which he ranted against what he claimed to be \\"[t]he white New York media\\" and claimed The Intercept had launched a racist smear campaign against him. In 2017, he had been working as communications director for the Gateway Housing Foundation a small, St. Louis-based, non-profit organization dedicated to helping the homeless. The Gateway Housing Foundation released a statement that Thompson had only worked there a short time and was released prior to his making bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers, an event which it condemned, noting that its founder had studied Hebrew. =Cyberstalking and bomb threats= In 2016, after Thompson's girlfriend broke up with him, he began harassing her and making bomb threats to Jewish Community Centers to get revenge. According to officials, Thompson phoned in and emailed many of the threats under his ex- girlfriend's name in an effort to frame her. Thompson also made at least one threat under his own name, under the pretense that his ex-girlfriend was framing him. He had also emailed the Anti-Defamation League in his own name in late February 2017, pointing to his ex-girlfriend as the perpetrator of all of the bomb threats. Thompson was arrested in March 2017 by the FBI in St. Louis for allegedly making bomb threats against at least eight Jewish community centers. He was also charged with one count of cyberstalking. He was extradited to New York and appeared in Manhattan federal court on March 29, where his public defender declined to seek bail. On April 10, Thompson pleaded not guilty to the charge of cyberstalking. He was scheduled to reappear in court on May 18. On June 13, Thompson pleaded guilty to one count of cyberstalking and one count of sending bomb threats to Jewish community centers. In December 2017, he was sentenced to five years in prison.

It has been suggested, as a possible etymological explanation, that the word was created as a combination of the two (exactly opposite) words kharab (\\"ruinous\\") and abad (\\"prosperous\\", also a suffix forming city names). In the words of Prof. Hamid Dabashi; \\"Persian literary historians have concurred that the word originally meant \\"house or tavern of ill repute\\" but was eventually appropriated by mystics to mean a place that they frequent by way of suspending all hypocritical pretense to piety (...) The idea is that there are places that you can frequent that will dismantle your beliefs, and yet, in doing so, will also restore your faith. The proverbial tavern in Persian poetry is that kharabat.\\" Nonetheless, since vowels are often omitted in Persian, the word could also be read as Khor-abat or, meaning the site of Khor. The word Khor refers to the Sun. The modern term for the Sun in Persian in Khor-shid, meaning \\"Sun shine.\\" This would link Persian poetry also to the ancient mystery cult of Mithraism, in which wine played a liturgical role. In this context, Khor-abat could potentially refer to type of Mithraeum. It could also symbolically refer to a high level of spirituality, that initiates would achieve through step-wise and arduous fellowship.Bahrami Gk, Annagheh A, Sabzevari S.

Forming as a moderate tropical storm on 3 March, Enawo initially drifted and intensified slowly. It strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 5 March and further an intense tropical cyclone on 6 March. Enawo made landfall over Sava Region on 7 March just after reaching peak intensity, and it emerged back into the Indian Ocean as a post-tropical depression late on 9 March, before dissipating two days later. Fifteen municipalities (out of 31) were severely affected, in the two most impacted districts of Antalaha and Maroantsetra. Meteorological history A monsoon trough started to persist west of Diego Garcia in late February 2017 as the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation (MJO) over the Indian Ocean grew more noticeable. On 2 March, a zone of disturbed weather formed within the area, although it was initially difficult to define a clear centre; later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the improving low-level structure and favourable environmental conditions. Only six hours after the system about north of Mauritius intensifying to a tropical disturbance, M√©t√©o- France upgraded it to a moderate tropical storm at 06:00 UTC on 3 March with the name Enawo from the Mauritius Meteorological Services, because of the recent ASCAT-B data suggesting gale-force winds. The JTWC also began to issue tropical cyclone warnings on Enawo. Since the afternoon, Enawo started to significantly slow down with the weakening of the tropical ridge that drove the track southwards. Due to easterly vertical wind shear, the centre was located in the eastern part of deep convection. Enawo developed into a severe tropical storm at around 18:00 UTC on 4 March, displaying an impressive embedded centre pattern associated with extremely cold cloud tops. The JTWC indicated a system equivalent to Category 1 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale at the same time. M√©t√©o-France upgraded Enawo to a tropical cyclone at 06:00 UTC on 5 March, after it resumed a west to west-southwest track steered by the mid- troposphere ridge south of Madagascar. Enawo formed a ragged eye soon afterward, thanks to favourable conditions of excellent outflow, weaker vertical wind shear, and warm sea surface temperatures; however, the strengthening phase was halted for a half of day owing to a possible eyewall replacement cycle. Enawo started to intensify again and developed a well- defined eye indicated by both of satellite and microwave imageries, prompting M√©t√©o-France upgrading the system to an intense tropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC based on the structural improvements. The JTWC reported that Enawo had become a Category 4-equivalent cyclone at 18:00 UTC, with one-minute maximum sustained winds at . Early on 7 March, cloud tops cooled again around the eye, despite the fluctuating eye definition. Enawo reached its peak intensity at 06:00 UTC on 7 March, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at and the central pressure at 932 hPa (27.32 inHg). Soon after that, Enawo made landfall over the area between Antalaha and Sambava in Sava Region, Madagascar at around 09:30 UTC (12:30 EAT), becoming the strongest landfall to the country since Gafilo in 2004. The cyclone started to rapidly weaken due to land interaction with a cloud-filled eye and the warming cloud tops; the JTWC also issued a final warning later for the inland movement. After classified as an overland depression early on 8 March and moving further inland, it started to accelerated southwards the next day along the weakening mid-troposphere ridge on Madagascar, with deep convection rather far away from the ill-defined centre. Meanwhile, gale-force winds still maintained over the eastern coast throughout the inland period. Enawo emerged into the Indian Ocean late on 9 March and was considered as a post-tropical depression by M√©t√©o-France because of the asymmetric and shallow core. However, the JTWC started to issue a tropical cyclone warning on Enawo again due to a warm anomaly at 10 km altitude. Despite a final warning from the JTWC again for winds below gale- force a half of day later, M√©t√©o-France indicated that Ex-Enawo strengthened again during its extratropical transition, according to data from ships. The system became fully extratropical soon afterward, before dissipating late on 11 March. Preparations and impact =Madagascar= Enawo over Madagascar on 8 March When Enawo attained intense tropical cyclone status, MFR warned of a significant storm surge of up to , declaring the storm to have become \\"very dangerous\\". Accordingly, Meteo Madagascar issued a red alert for several regions expected to be impacted by the storm. The National Bureau of Risk and Disaster Management has advised the evacuation of low-lying areas and the acquisition of supplies in advance of the storm. The Piroi regional center of the International Red Cross has prepared to intervene should the government demand it. Enawo made landfall halfway between the towns of Sambava and Antalaha as an Intense Tropical Cyclone at approximately 09:30 UTC (12:30 a.m. local time) on 7 March. In the district of Maroantsetra, landslides and strong winds caused widespread infrastructural damage, which also rendered 500 people homeless. There, a landslide killed one adult and two children, in addition to injuring six others. The city of Antalaha was particularly hard hit, where the port became inaccessible and half the population was rendered homeless. Rice fields in Antalaha and Sambava districts were submerged after heavy rain and suffered severe losses. The Lohoko River burst its banks near Farahalana, inundating part of the town. As of 17 March, 78 deaths have been reported across the country, with 18 other people reported missing. Total damages were estimated to be US$50 million. = R√©union = Although the cyclone was not expected to bring direct impacts to R√©union, a storm surge warning was in effect for the northern part of the island due to swells of from the cyclone.

The 516-word abstract contained the words \\"good\\" and \\"great\\" a combined total of 28 times (and is available online). Despite making no sense, the work was accepted within three hours of submission and a conference registration fee of US$1099 requested. ConferenceSeries is associated with the OMICS Publishing Group, which produces open access journals widely regarded as predatory, and has been accused of moving into \\"predatory meetings\\". Bartneck said he was \\"reasonably certain that this is a money-making conference with little to no commitment to science,\\" given the poor quality of the review process and the high cost of attendance. Chemistry * \\"Who's Afraid of Peer Review?\\": In 2013 John Bohannon wrote in Science about a \\"sting operation\\" he conducted in which he submitted \\"a credible but mundane scientific paper, one with such grave errors that a competent peer reviewer should easily identify it as flawed and unpublishable\\", to 304 open-access publishers. 157 journals accepted the paper. There have been some objections to the sting's methodology and about what conclusions can be drawn from it. Medicine * John McLachlan, a professor of medical education, hoaxed the Jerusalem Conference on Integrative Medicine in 2010 with invented nonsense. *Dr Elaine Murphy hoaxed the British Medical Journal in 1974 with a case report on the fictional medical condition cello scrotum. * In August 2020, the graduate student Mathieu Rebeaud and the professor of philosophy Florian Cova hoaxed the predatory Asian Journal of Medicine and Health with an article titled SARS- CoV-2 was Unexpectedly Deadlier than Push-scooters: Could Hydroxychloroquine be the Unique Solution?Journal accepts fake story about scooters and hydroxychloroquineHydroxychloroquine, push-scooters, and COVID-19: A journal gets stung, and swiftly retracts. The authors list include none other than the then French president's dog, NemoFull article on researchget.net. Psychology * In 2007, Tomasz Witkowski published a fake article in the psychology journal Charaktery. James Randi and other science bloggers covered the hoax. Interdisciplinary and cultural studies * The Sokal affair: Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London, wrote a paper titled \\"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity\\", which proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. The paper was published in the Social Text spring/summer 1996 \\"Science Wars\\" issue. At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.. Reply by Alan Sokal. On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax. * The Soci√©t√©s hoax: Using a false identity, Manuel Quinon and Arnaud Saint-Martin submitted an intentionally inept and absurd article on the \\"Autolib'\\", a small rentable car in Paris, to Michel Maffesoli's Soci√©t√©s journal. The article was deliberately incoherent and plastered with liberal quotes and references to Maffesoli and other postmodern thinkers. The article was duly \\"reviewed\\" by two people, before being accepted and published in Soci√©t√©s without any substantial editing. * In May 2017, Peter Boghossian and James Lindsay published an absurd paper in the open access journal Cogent Social Sciences which argued that the penis is best understood not as a biological organ but rather as a social construct. The paper came to an absurd conclusion that the conceptual penis is a \\"driver behind much of climate change\\". The authors' goal was to expose bias towards extreme ideologies in social science and gender studies. Critics of the sting operation argue that it did not demonstrate the existence of such biases, despite the authors' goals of doing so. Phil Torres of Salon, for example, argued that the sting shows only that academic journals that require authors to pay for papers to be published have a financial inclination \\"to accept papers regardless of quality.\\" He also noted that none of the editorial board members of Cogent Social Sciences have expertise in gender studies. James E. McWilliams criticized the authors' motives, writing that \\"Boghossian and Lindsay are white men working in the most male-dominated academic fields (philosophy and math) attempting to humiliate through bullying one of the few academic fields dominated by women. In our current political climate‚Äîthriving as it does on shamelessness and humiliation‚Äîthis scenario, as the motives become increasingly transparent, only calls for kind of scrutiny and understanding that gender studies can provide.\\" *The \\"Grievance Studies\\" affair (also referred to as the \\"Sokal Squared\\" Hoax by the news media): Over 2017-2018 Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and Peter Boghossian wrote 20 hoax articles; at the time the hoax stopped, four papers had been published, three had been accepted but not yet published, seven were under review, and six had been rejected. The papers all focused on what the authors called \\"grievance studies\\" related to race, gender, sexuality and other forms of identity. The hoax was revealed and halted after one of the papers in the feminist geography journal Gender, Place and Culture was criticized on social media, and then on Campus Reform, which led a Wall Street Journal editorial writer to investigate and report on it. The paper, which was in the process of being retracted when the Wall Street Journal story broke, referred to dog parks as \\"petri dishes for canine rape culture\\". The report also described a paper published in Affilia which contained a reworded excerpt from Mein Kampf.

History According to the records of United States missionaries in Shandong, Pastor Gary of the Presbyterian Church and Jesse Boardman Hartwell of the Southern Baptist Convention arrived in Laizhou in 1862. In a county fair they came across Zhong Ning, who was from the quarrying village of Ning located about four kilometres to the west of Laizhou, and preached to him: he was immediately converted to Christianity. Afterwards he went back to his village and founded a church. This is the earliest written record of the spread of Christianity in Laizhou. Later, due to the American Civil War, the Southern Baptist Convention hit economic difficulties, Pastor Hartwell left Shandong to work in Shanghai as a translator for a living, and the Presbyterian Church settled down in Ning from then on. In 1865, Mateer and Hunter Corbett arrived in the state of Laizhou for missionary work and stayed there for a week.Daniel W. Fisher (nd): \\"Calvin Wilson Mateer, Forty-Five Years a Missionary in Shantung,China, A Biography\\" In the late Qing Dynasty, 26th Guangxu (1900 Year), the American pastor John W Lowe bought a piece of land in Xiyingfang Village, where he built a four-story church. The top floor was used as a bell tower, commonly known as the awning floor (the address is now that of the Laizhou construction company). Inside, a church was set up, described as \\"Baptist\\". At the same time, to the south of the east road of the town's main crossroad, the Gospel Church was founded, where missionary work and preaching was held on Sundays. Later, the American pastor Lan Martin took it over. Lan Martin lived a long time (14 years) in Laizhou, developing believers, establishing schools, hospitals and orphanages. In 1926, Martin was succeeded by Johnson, and Johnson later by KeliPei (in Chinese Pinyin; the original English-language name is unidentifiable); both were Americans. The last priests were Lutheran (US) and Fanwu Wang (China). In 1942, the church was occupied by the Japanese invaders. From 1906, at the current location of Laizhou Hospital, the construction of Meitie Hospital started, and was completed in 1908. It was reported that in the beginning, the construction was led by two Americans surnamed Meerfeld and Tieze, after whom the hospital was named. The hospital was divided into Meitie Male department and Ailin Female department, which was named after Katherine Melaury from the Southern Baptist Church. Both departments were equipped with beds. On the eve of the Japanese invasion and war, the Americans were transferred away, and thereafter the church was presided over by the doctor Lu Xianzhai (from Huang County) and his wife. It was destroyed at the end of the war. Nowadays, the Laizhou County branch of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches Committee in China rents the church located to the north of East Gate Street as a venue. This was originally built by the German Catholic priest Kaisiduo (possibly an early Chinese translation of Christoph) in 1902 or so (allegedly purchased as a private residence).

The route was opened on 1 January 2017, making London the 15th European city to have a railway route connection with China, and takes 18 days to complete\\"Silk Road freight train from China arrives in Barking\\", BBC, 18 January 2017 (other European cities with China-Europe railway routes include Hamburg, Madrid, Rotterdam, Warsaw, etc.). From Yiwu, a trading center 300 km south of Shanghai, the track passes through 9 countries: China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany, Belgium, France, UK. In order to get to the UK the route passes through the Channel Tunnel between France and the UK. The London end of the line is located at the DB Eurohub in Barking, East London. Break- of-gauge Two breaks of gauge exist: first from standard gauge in China to Russian gauge in Kazakhstan, and second back to standard gauge when crossing from Belarus to Poland. Because of the difference in gauges trains go through Bogie exchange or have containers reloaded to railcars of the correct gauge.Shepard, Wade (2016-01-28), \\"Why The China-Europe 'Silk Road' Rail Network Is Growing Fast\\", Forbes Travel time Despite the need to go through Bogie exchange, the trip takes only 18 days to complete. In comparison, it takes a large cargo vessel about 30‚Äì45 days of sailing to get from East Asia to Northern Europe. Trains are run by different companies. To start with, trains depart for London once a week transporting household items, garments, bags and suitcases. The media has perceived the route as a publicity stunt, as household items and clothing do not require the expedited shipping. The Yiwu ‚Äì London railway project is part of China's paramount leader Xi Jinping‚Äôs \\"One Belt, One Road\\" policy, which attempts to strengthen the country‚Äôs trade connections and revive the Silk Road of the past.  Politics  Poland's President Andrzej Duda and China's leader Xi Jinping wave to the crowd during the inauguration of the railway line in Warsaw, Poland, 20 June 2016 While the physical manifestation of and the need for the Silk Road may have eroded over the years due to the collapse of the Safavid Empire and advances in technology, Chinese leader Xi Jinping‚Äôs \\"One Belt, One Road\\" policy has breathed new life into trade of goods by land. The initiative calls for integration of the countries that make up the ancient Silk Road into a robust economic area. The integration will take place through building infrastructure for broadening trade, and increasing cultural exchanges. One Belt, One Road calls for three distinct routes to be established: north, central and south. The north route goes through Central Asia, Russia and then Europe. The central route goes through Central Asia, West Asia, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean. The south route goes through Southeast Asia and to the Indian Ocean. The Yiwu-London train is part of the north route. While the Eurasian Land Bridge was completed in 1990, when the railway systems of China and Kazakhstan connected at Alataw Pass, it was first in October 2008 that the first Trans-Eurasia Logistics train reached Hamburg from Xiangtan officially traveling along the entire north route. However, it is only since July 2011 that the railway line has been used for regular transport when a freight route was established between Chongqing, China, and Duisburg, Germany (the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe Railway). Since then several other European cities have established railway freight connections with China on the network. London is the latest European city to establish such a freight route when the Yiwu- London route opened in January 2017. It is expected that the importance of the railway trade routes will increase with time, as anticipated cumulative investment over an indefinite timescale for the One Belt, One Road policy is estimated to be between 4 and 8 trillion US dollars.\\"Getting lost in One Belt, One Road\\", ejinsight, 12 April 2016\\"Our bulldozers, our rules\\", The Economist, 2 July 2016 The Yiwu‚ÄìLondon railway line opened just as Britain was looking outside of Europe to expand its trade, as it is unclear how Brexit will affect UK trade with Europe. British Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 in March 2017, officially starting the Brexit negotiations. It is unknown whether the Yiwu‚ÄìLondon railway line will lead to increased trade between China and the UK. Both governments hope that it will help strengthen trade between the two countries, but the service was only scheduled to run once a week for a few months in order to assess demand. If successful, the rail link could be made permanent.\\"First direct train service from China to the UK arrives in London\\", Independent, 18 January 2017 The China-Madrid railway line has experienced success by transporting olive oil back to China and it is expected that in order to become as successful, the China-London line will need to establish a similar export flow.

Facts The ‚ÄòFrack Free Balcombe Residents Association‚Äô applied for judicial review of West Sussex County Council‚Äôs decision to give planning permission to Cuadrilla to explore and appraise an existing hydrocarbon lateral borehole for shale gas (i.e. to see if fracking would work).

There was no evidence that the planning officer had misled the council committee about PHE‚Äôs views on sulphur dioxide emissions into the air, produced by the flare. 81-83.

It held a landowner also owned the strata and minerals, unless they conveyed it, in common law or statute, to someone else, so an oil company making wells below the surface was trespass, and had to pay compulsory purchase compensation under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 s 8(2). Facts Bocardo claimed Star Energy (now owned by IGas Energy) committed trespass, and that a licence under the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934 was no defence. Star Energy had a licence to search for, bore and get petroleum under the Petroleum (Production) Act 1934 section 2 at Palmers Wood Oil Field, at Godstone in Surrey. It got the licence in 1999, though it was originally issued by the Secretary of State for Energy in 1980 to Conoco. Its predecessors drilled three diagonal wells, with pipelines going between below land Bocardo owned. Star Energy had never sought Bocardo's permission. Judgment =High Court= Peter Smith J held that Bocardo's title extended to the substrata beneath the land's surface, and though the pipelines cause not damage, nor affected enjoyment, there was a trespass. Under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 s 8(2) compensation would be based on ‚Äòwhat would be fair and reasonable between a willing grantor and a willing grantee‚Äô. He awarded ¬£621,180, calculated at 9% of the value of the oil extracted between July 2000 and December 2007, and continuing damages for trespass based on the same. =Court of Appeal= The Court of Appeal reduced compensation to ¬£1,000, on the basis that the trespass was actionable but technical. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court held by a majority of three to two that the Court of Appeal had been correct. Bocardo did own the ground, and was entitled to claim for trespass by the wells. Star Energy had no defence in trespass under PPA 1934 s 10(3) (re-enacted in PA 1998 s 9(2). It was irrelevant if a landowner did not make use of the ground. But, for assessing damages, the right measure was the amount of compensation payable under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966. This operated to prevent the powerful bargaining position of a landowner to control access to a potentially valuable oilfield. Lord Hope, giving the first and dissenting judgment, said a landowner did own the ground beneath, including minerals, unless there was a conveyance or statute, as in Mitchell [1914] 1 Ch 438. There had to be a logical limit, where pressure and temperature to the Earth's core made ownership so absurd as to be not worth arguing about, but the wells were not that deep. Lord Walker agreed on the trespass issue, but said the Court of Appeal was right on damages. Lord Brown said the right compensation was small. In his view by the PPA 1934, giving the Crown exclusive rights: Lord Collins agreed with Lord Hope on the principles and Lord Brown on quantum. Lord Clarke dissented.

During his long career, American film director Chris Columbus has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, are officially scrapped or linger in \\"development hell.\\"  1980s  = Indiana Jones and the Monkey King = In 1985, Columbus wrote an script for a third Indiana Jones film entitled Indiana Jones and the Monkey King. Columbus' script was about the trip of Indy along his assistant Betsy to a secret city protected by soldier gorillas and governed by the evil Monkey King. According to Columbus, he wrote the script so that the story doesn't look like the previous film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. However, at the end, Columbus' script was rejected and the film was finally released in 1989 under the title Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and directed by Steven Spielberg.  1990s  = Fantastic Four = In 1995, Columbus wrote for 20th Century Fox a script for the long time planned Fantastic Four feature-length film. The film was supposed to be released around the 2001 summer. Peter Segal was attached to direct it, but later, he dropped the project, so Raja Gosnell took the director's chair, but he dropped it after being hired by Warner Bros. to direct Scooby-Doo and its sequel. After this, director Peyton Reed entered into the project and wanted to cast Ren√©e Zellweger as Invisible Woman. The film was finally released in 2005, directed by Tim Story and written by Michael France and Mark Frost. = Galaxy High School = Plans for a live- action film adaptation of his own 1986 animated TV series Galaxy High was planned in partnership with John H. Williams of Vanguard Films, and reteamed with Chris Columbus to develop the big screen version of Galaxy High School. After various development deals with both DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures, So far nothing ever came out of it, either being scrapped or in development hell. = Daredevil = In 1997, Columbus was hired by Columbia Pictures to write a script for a Daredevil feature film. Columbus' script was later leaked on Internet in 1999. Despite this, Columbia dropped the project and 20th Century Fox bought the rights. The film was finally released in 2003 and directed by Mark Steven Johnson.  2000s  = The Sub-Mariner = In July 2004, Columbus was hired to direct a film adaptation of Namor. The film was supposed to be released in 2007, however, in 2005, Columbus abandoned the project. = live-action Dilbert film= On February 16, 2007, Columbus was in talks to direct a Dilbert film. On May 26, 2010, Ken Kwapis was hired to direct the film, instead of Columbus. = Ripley‚Äôs Believe It or Not film= In October 2008, Columbus pitched an idea for the Ripley‚Äôs Believe It or Not film that was approved by Jim Carrey and Paramount, scrapped the previous China-based storyline entirely, with plans for a 2011 release, and hoped that it would be the start of a Ripley's film series. In January 2011, Eric Roth was hired to write the script, with Carrey and Columbus still attached.

Fort Bainbridge is believed to be named in honor of naval captain William Bainbridge. It was either constructed in late 1813 or early 1814 by Georgia troops under the command of Colonel Homer V. Milton or General John B. Floyd in an effort to protect the supply route from Fort Hull to Fort Mitchell. Floyd left his supplies at the fort when he marched westward to fight the Battle of Calebee Creek. Fort Bainbridge was built in the style of a bastion fort with eight outcroppings. Captain Kendall Lewis, along with his Creek chief father-in law, Big Warrior, operated a tavern as a stagecoach stop about 400 yards west of Fort Bainbridge, which stayed open under the care of Lewis' widow until at least 1836. During his return tour, the Marquis de Lafayette stayed at the Lewis Tavern for his first night in Alabama. The site of the fort also lies along naturalist William Bartram's four-year journey through the Southern United States, during which he documented the flora, fauna and Native Americans of the area. The fort site was later used as a plantation. Today, it remains unmarked and its legacy lies in a small unincorporated community, Boromville, that developed from it.

It runs from Strandvejen in the southeast to a junction just east of K√¶gersborg station in the northwest. The first leg of the road passes through Charlottenlund Forest, and it later follows the north boundary of Bernstorff Park. It passes a number of historic buildings, including Charlottenlund Palace, Bernstorff Palace and Sch√¶fferg√•rden. History J√¶gersborg All√© in the first half of the 19th century J√¶gersborg All√© after the turn of the century J√¶gersborg All√© was built on the orders of King Christian V by farmers from the parish of Gentofte. It is first mentioned in 1695, and it is believed that it was completed in the summer of 1706. The road provided a direct connection between J√¶gersborg and Gyldenlund and would also be used for royal hunts. He also constructed a pheasantry en route between the two properties. It was used for breeding pheasants for the royal hunts. Christian V died in 1699, and therefore, never saw his road finished. Gyldenlund was taken over by queen Charlotte Amalie and replaced by Charlottenlund Palace in 1730-733. J.H.E. Bernstorff received the Pheasantry from the king and constructed Bernstorff House at the site. H√¶gersborg was replaced by the Hermitage in J√¶gersborg Deer Garden and demolished in circa 1760. Bernstorffvej was constructed in 1770, linking the Royal Frederiksborg Toad with Bernstorff House and J√¶gersborg All√©. In 1829, J√¶gersborg All√© was finally opened to the public. Carriages had to pay a fee which was collected at a boom barrier in Charlottenlund. The area became more accessible with the opening of the L√¶ampenborg and Ltngby Railways in 1863. The land along the road was gradually built over. Notable buildings and residents No. 166: Sch√¶fferg√•rden Charlottenlund Palace (No 1A) is currently home to DTU Aqua. The small building at No. 2A is a former garage for a horse-drawn fire carriage. Its location next to the still existing restaurant Ved Stalden (\\"At the Stables\\") meant that horses were always present at the site in the event of fire. The building is from 1882 and was designed by Ferdinand Meldahl. No. 185-229; Alle husene Lille Bernstorff (No. 17), formerly known as Trianglen, is a house from 1811. The buildings at No. 92-94 and 90, an L-shaped main building and a stable, both from c. 1800, are also listed. J√¶gerg√•rden (No. 150), a complex of low, tallow buildings, was built in the 1750s to design by Lauritz de Thurah. It was for a while used and as stables for the king's hunting dogs and from the 1790s as army barracks. Sch√¶fferg√•rden (No. 166) is a Rococo-style mansion from 1756. It has later been expanded and is now operated as a hotel and conference centre. The house \\"Ibstrup\\" at No. 170 A has nothing to do with the much older and long gone predecessor of J√¶gersborg Castle. The L-shaped main building is from 1867 and listed. All√©husene (No. 185-229), a development of terraced housing, was built in 148-53 to design by Arne Jacobsen. Chr. Olesen & Co., a manufacturer and distributor of ingredients for the animal feed, food and pharma industries, is based at No. 164. Monuments and memorials A Femvejen, a roundabout where J√¶gersborg All√©, Bernstorffsvek, Ordrupvej and two others roads meet, is a memorial to King Christian IX and Queen Louise. The memorial was designed by the architect Andreas Vlemmesen and executed by the sculptor Anders Bundgaard. It was unveiled on 6 September 1913. Outside J√¶gersborg All√© 184 is a stone commemorating J√∏rgen Haagen Schmith, better known under the codename Citronen (Danish for the Lemon), a prominent member of the Danish resistance movement during World War II, who was killed at the site early in the morning on 15 October 1944.

Ptyctodus belongs to the family Ptyctodontidae and is of the class Placodermi. They share a close resemblance to modern day chimaeras (Holocephali). Fossils of this armour-plated fish have been found in locations such as in Russia, the Michigan Basis, and Arizona, United States.  Description and paleobiology  Ptyctodus species come in a variety of different sizes, measured data shows three specimens being 94 millimeters, 24 millimeters, 22 millimeters in length, 23 millimeters, 6 millimeters, 4 millimeter in height, and 18 millimeters, 7 millimeters, and 4 millimeters in thickness. Through time, an evolutionary morphological trait is that the species within Ptyctodontidae reduce the dermal armour. The dentition of the Ptyctodus has dental elements that are very similarly observed in chimaeroids. Its dental plates are compressed into a thin cutting edge behind the symphysis and measure 3 inches in thickness and several inches in length. The are expressed as fine punctae in parallel rows. Ptyctodus teeth are very close together in a way that they are like a fish tooth conglomerate. They were also armed with dorsal fin spines closely seen in Hetercanthus and Phlyctaenacanthus. Just like the other members of the family of Ptyctodontidae, there is a sexual dimorphism between the genders of Ptyctodus in the pelvic region where the characteristics are different; males had claspers, while females had large scale like pelvic fins along with their endoskeleton. Ptyctodus lived in a nektonic carnivore type- ecology and in carbonate, lagoonal, and shallow subtidal environments. Due to structure and shape of the teeth Ptyctodus would easily be able to crush shellfish like organisms at the bottom of the ocean floors, feeding mainly off of that. They also must seem to have been very agile swimmers, able to escape predators, like arthrodires.

She is known for her work in installations, book arts, immersive text-based installations, large-scale public text pieces, publications, collage, and audio recordings. Rasheed's art explores memory, ritual, discursive regimes, historiography, and archival practices through the use of fragments and historical residue. Based in Brooklyn, NY, she is currently the Arts Editor for SPOOK magazine and is also a contributing editor for The New Inquiry.  Background  = Early life = Born in East Palo Alto, California to Sunni Muslim parents, Rasheed characterizes herself as \\"a Muslim kid enrolled at a Catholic school and attended Mormon school dances, who went to shabbat dinners and attended Sunday church services with friends.\\" When Rasheed was twelve years old, her family was unlawfully evicted from their home due to the sharp increase of land value in northern California near East Palo Alto, and entered a period of homelessness that lasted for the next ten years. The experience of moving through temporary homes with her family led to an interest in the practice of collecting and archiving to cope with her forced displacement. Rasheed attended Pomona College for her undergraduate degree, studying public policy and Africana. She traces her interest in visual art to class on black aesthetics and the politics of representation taken in her penultimate semester at Pomona. She was awarded an Amy Biehl Fulbright Scholarship to study in South Africa. Returning to the U.S., she completed a graduate degree in secondary education from Stanford University. Early in her career, Rasheed taught social studies from the elementary school to high school level. Her background in history and pedagogy influences her artistic practice. = Visual art = Rasheed came to photography and collaging while living and studying in South Africa as an exchange student, and later as a Fulbright Scholar, where she discovered an interest in the act of documentation and interviewing. The first iteration of her immersive installation, No Instructions for Assembly, Activation I (2013), took place at Real Art Ways and consisted of over six hundred objects, including found and personal family photos, album covers, tufts of family members' hair, Islamic prayer rugs, newspaper clippings, jewelry, prayer beads, black stockings, and mirrors, among other items. Subsequent iterations of the installation have invited audiences to modify and contribute their own objects and histories to her growing archive.  Themes  The major themes of Rasheed's work revolve around conflicting histories, visual culture, being black in America, unearthing buried narratives, and the complexity of memory. Her art engages with her background in history and education, turning exhibitions into pedagogical experiences and opportunities to explore archives, our personal relationship with history, and public spaces. Rasheed's art has used distinctive signs with large, capitalized font in public spaces arranged in series or a grid. For instance, How to Suffer Politely (And Other Etiquette) is a series of billboard-size yellow posters with all-black font announcing slogans like \\"LOWER THE PITCH OF YOUR SUFFERING\\" or \\"TELL YOUR STRUGGLE WITH TRIUMPHANT HUMOR\\". The work engages with the Black Lives Matter movement, noting how people were told not to react with anger to police killing people of color in America, but also with etiquette guides from the 1800s. Similarly, Art After Trump is a political abecedarius with all-capitalized lines spelling out phrases like \\"SUPERLATIVE SUBJUGATION\\" and \\"PIGMENTED PRIVILEGE\\". Education Rasheed holds an M.A. in Secondary Education from Stanford University and received a B.A. in 2006 from Pomona College in Public Policy and Africana Studies. Awards and fellowships Rasheed has been the recipient of numerous grants, fellowships, and residencies, including: 2016 * Artist-in-residence, Bronx Museum of Art Co-Lab Residency  New York, NY * Artist-in-residence, Creative Exchange Lab - Portland Institute of Contemporary Art  Portland, OR * Artist-in-residence, Smack Mellon  Brooklyn, NY * Artist-in-residence, The Center for Afrofuturist Studies at Public Space One  Iowa City, IA * Copy Shop Resident, Endless Editions at Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop  New York, NY * Shortlisted, Visionary Award from the Tim Hetherington Trust  New York, NY * Fellow, Ossian Fellowship - Jain Family Institute  New York, NY 2015 * Artist-in-residence, Lower East Side Print Shop  New York, NY * Commissioned Artist/Scholar in Residence, Triple Canopy at New York Public Library Labs  New York, NY * Grantee, Artadia: The Fund for Art and Dialogue  New York, NY * Fellow, Artist Fellowship, AIR Gallery  Brooklyn, NY * Fellow, Queens Museum ‚Äì Jerome Foundation Fellowship Program, Queens Museum  Queens, NY * Fellow, Artist in the Marketplace (AIM 35), Bronx Museum  Bronx, NY 2014 * Grantee, Art Matters Foundation  New York, NY * Grantee, Rema Hort Mann Foundation Emerging Artist Grant  New York, NY * Artist-in-residence, Working Classrooms  Albuquerque, NM * Artist-in-residence, Vermont Studio Center  Johnson, VT 2013 * Fellow (Create Change Professional Development), The Laundromat Project  New York, NY * Juror, Center for Photography at Woodstock A-I-R  Woodstock, NY * Artist-in-residence, Center for Book Arts  New York, NY * Artist-in- residence, Visual Artist Network - Real Art Ways  Hartford, CT * Grantee, Visual Artist Network Community Fund - Real Art Ways  Hartford, CT 2012 * Awardee, STEP UP - Real Arts Ways  Hartford, CT * Artist-in-residence, Center for Photography at Woodstock  Woodstock, New York 2006 * United States Fulbright Amy S.

The mountain is part of the Cascade Range. Gunn Peak is the highest point of the Wild Sky Wilderness. The mountain was named for homesteader/miner Amos Gunn who started the nearby town of Index, Washington, and also named nearby Mount Index.Gunn Peak peakware.com Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skykomish River. Climate Gunn Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

In 2007 Wilson moved from Brooklyn, New York to Carrizozo, New Mexico (population 996) where she currently lives and works with her woodworking partner Mike Lagg. Early life Paula Wilson grew up in Hyde Park on the south side of Chicago where her father, William Julius Wilson, was a professor of sociology at the University of Chicago. Her mother, Beverly Ann Wilson, is an artist and bookbinder. Education Paula Wilson attended Washington University (St. Louis, MO) from 1994‚Äì1998, earning her B.F.A. and graduating summa cum laude. Wilson earned her M.F.A. from Columbia University (New York, NY) in 2005. Life and work Wilson is known for her monumental and tactile work describing narratives and environments that fit her experience as a biracial black woman. She reimagines art historical tropes and inserts versions of herself into the landscape and canon. Shifting between graphic and painterly representations, she builds narratives by collapsing pictorial planes. Wilson‚Äôs work is anchored in self-portrait, printmaking, installation, and collage. She prints images with wood blocks, silkscreens, intaglio, and monotypes; layers acrylic, oil, and spray paint; shoots videos inserting 2-D work into the landscape; she cuts, glues, and stitches to make colorful, dense assemblages. Her works often burst from their wall or frame, reflecting a constant re-assembly of lived experiences: black and white, urban and rural, traditional and contemporary, singular and collective. Wilson is co-founder of the artist organizations MoMAZoZo (founded in 2010) and the Carrizozo Artist in Residency (AIR)(founded in 2016). = Academia = Wilson was a Visiting Critic at Yale School of Art from 2005‚Äì2007 and an Assistant Professor at Columbia University School of the Arts from 2007‚Äì2008. In 2015 she served as the Louis D. Beaumont Artist-in-Residence & Visiting Assistant Professor in the College and Graduate School of Art in the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO. She has been a visiting artist at many institutions and universities nationally. * Visiting Artist, Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH, 2020 * Visiting Artists, Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, MI, 2020 * Visiting Lecturer, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA, 2017 * Visiting Lecturer, Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, NY, 2017 * Visiting Artist, Boston University, Boston, MA, 2016 = Solo Exhibitions = * 2000‚Äì\\"What's So Personal,\\" The Butcher Shop, Chicago, IL http://paulajwilson.com/cv-2/ * 2006‚Äì\\"Paintings and Drawings from the Hanno Valley,\\" Galleria Suzy Shammah, Milan, Italy http://www.suzyshammah.com/exhibition.php?s_sez=select&id;_e=35&id;_a=&anno;=2006 * 2008‚Äì\\"The Stained Glass Ceiling,\\" Bellwether Gallery, New York, NY * 2010‚Äì\\"First Story,\\" The Fabric Workshop and Museum, Philadelphia, PA * 2014‚Äì\\"Undress,\\" Center for Contemporary Arts, Spector Ripps Project Space, Santa Fe, NM * 2015‚Äì\\"Back it Up,\\" Museum Blue, St. Louis, MO * 2015‚Äì\\"Salty & Fresh,\\" Cherry & Lucic, Portland, OR * 2017‚Äì\\"Salty & Fresh,\\" Emerson Dorsch Gallery, Miami, FL * 2017‚Äì\\"Paula Wilson:The Backward Glance,\\" Bemis Center for Contemporary Art, Omaha, NE * 2018‚Äì\\"FLOORED,\\" HOLDING Contemporary, Portland, OR * 2018‚Äì\\"PIECESCAPE,\\" Visitor Welcome Center, Los Angeles, CA * 2018‚Äì\\"Spread Wild: Pleasures of the Yucca,\\" Smack Mellon, Brooklyn, NY * 2018‚Äì\\"The Light Becomes You,\\" Denny Dimin Gallery, New York, NY * 2019‚Äì\\"Entangled,\\" 516 ARTS, Albuquerque, NM = Selected Group Exhibitions = * 2019‚Äì\\"Contemporary Performance,\\" curated by Kalup Linzy, Florida Museum of Photographic Art, Tampa, FL * 2019‚Äì\\"Fragment,\\" Emerson Dorsch Gallery https://emersondorsch.com/, Miami, FL * 2019‚Äì\\"In This Body of Mine: Strange Fire Collective at the Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design,\\" Milwaukee, WI * 2019‚Äì\\"20 and Odd: The 400-Year Anniversary of 1619,\\" curated by Kalia Brooks Nelson, Leroy Neiman Gallery, Columbia University, New York, NY * 2017‚Äì\\"Sunrise, Sunset,\\" Emerson Dorsch Gallery, Miami, FL * 2017‚Äì\\"The Unhomely,\\" Denny Gallery, New York, NY * 2017‚Äì\\"The Young Years, The Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College,\\" curated by Dayton Director Ian Berry, Saratoga Springs, NY * 2016‚Äì\\"Surface Area: Selections from the Permanent Collection,\\"Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY * 2016‚Äì\\"Residency,\\" form & concept, Santa Fe, NM * 2016‚Äì\\"Visions Into Infinite Archives,\\" SOMArts Cultural Center, curated by Black Salt Collective, San Francisco, CA * 2015‚ÄìDRAW: Mapping Madness, Inside ‚Äì Out Art Museum, curated by Tomas Vu, Beijing, China 2014 * 2013‚Äì\\"I Am The Magic Hand,\\" Sikkema Jenkins & Co, Organized by Josephine Halvorson, New York, NY * 2013‚Äì \\"Sanctify,\\" Vincent Price Museum, Los Angeles, CA * 2012‚Äì\\"The Bearden Project,\\" Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, NY * 2012‚Äì\\"Configured,\\" Benrimon Contemporary, Curated By Teka Selman, New York, NY * 2011‚Äì\\"Art by Choice,\\" Mississippi Museum of Art, Jackson, MS * 2011‚Äì\\"The February Show,\\" Ogilvy & Mather, New York, NY * 2010‚Äì\\"Art on Paper: The 41st Exhibition,\\" Weatherspoon Art Museum, Greensboro, NC * 2010‚Äì\\"Defrosted: A Life of Walt Disney,\\" Postmasters Gallery, New York, NY * 2010‚Äì\\"41st Collectors Show,\\" Arkansas Art Center, Little Rock, AR * 2009‚Äì\\"Carrizozo Artist‚Äôs Show,\\" Gallery 408, Carrizozo, NM * 2009‚Äì\\"While We Were Away,\\" Sragow Gallery, New York, NY * 2009‚Äì\\"A Decade of Contemporary American Printmaking: 1999‚Äì2009,\\" Tsingha University, Beijing, China * 2009‚Äì\\"Collected.
