Located in northern Clark County at the easternmost end of Chelatchie Prairie, it rises to an elevation of , about above the flat prairie. This Pleistocene dacite lava dome is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, and with an age of only about 70,000 years, Tumtum Mountain is the youngest and westernmost volcano in the Cascades of Washington state.  Geography and access  Tumtum Mountain is located among the foothills of the Cascade Range, about 2 miles (3 km) east of Washington State Route 503 via NE Healy Rd, whose junction is just north of the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument headquarters in Chelatchie (officially Amboy, Washington). Healy Rd becomes Forest Road 54 as it enters Gifford Pinchot National Forest and traverses along the northern base of Tumtum Mountain, and a gated logging road ascending the north flank provides access to the mountain. The active stratovolcano of Mount St. Helens is located only 19 miles (30 km) to the north-northeast, easily visible from the summit of Tumtum Mountain on clear days. The historic Yale Bridge, a one-lane metal suspension bridge built in 1932 over the steep canyon of the Lewis River at the eastern end of Lake Merwin, is located about 2.5 miles (4 km) to the northwest on SR 503. Yale Dam, a high hydroelectric dam built in 1953, is located about 2 miles (3 km) to the north of the mountain.  Geology  Tumtum Mountain was apparently formed by lava rising to the surface along the northeasterly-striking Chelatchie Fault, which passes along the southern edge of Chelatchie Prairie and underneath the mountain. The surrounding rocks in the area are mostly much older basaltic lava flows, pyroclastics, and sediments of late Eocene to Miocene age (i.e. 5‚Äì40 million years old), heavily eroded and weathered. Much later, in the Pleistocene (within the last 10,000 to 2 million years), a large glacier filled the Lewis River valley, with an ice thickness reaching an elevation of in the vicinity of Tumtum Mountain, higher than the present summit. Glacial drift deposited by this glacier covers almost all of the region, but none is found on Tumtum Mountain itself, and the mountain shows no evidence of glacial erosion, so it must be younger than this last regional glaciation. Geologists estimate its age at around 70,000 years. The rock of Tumtum Mountain is a very fine-grained light buff to gray dacite, with silica content of 68%, fairly typical and similar to that found in the lava domes of Mount St. Helens. The volcanic cone of Tumtum Mountain consists of talus and fragments of this dacite surrounding the lava dome itself. In addition, a small dacite lava flow is found on the north side at the base of the mountain, overlying the regional glacial drift.  History  The land on Tumtum Mountain has been owned by a succession of logging companies over the past several decades, including Crown Zellerbach, Cavenham Forest Industries, and then private logging company owner Billie McKee Sr. since 1988. At some point the entire mountain was logged by one of these owners. An estate sale in 2011 placed a 360-acre (150 hectare) parcel containing the majority of the mountain on the market for $1.4 million, later reduced to $699,900.

Among the founders was the Surrealist poet Georges Henein; the group was based mostly but not exclusively on Surrealism.  History  The origins of Art et Libert√© lie in a manifesto published by Henein and others on 22 December 1938 titled Vive L'Art D√©g√©ner√©! (\\"Long Live Degenerate Art!\\"); it carried thirty- six signatures. The group adopted the term \\"degenerate\\" as a badge of honor. It was originally used as a demeaning term by Germany's Nazi Party in the Entartete Kunst exhibition as a way to ridicule modern art. The group was officially formed on 19 January 1939, and brought together Henein and other Cairo Surrealists, such as Kamel el-Telmissany and Ramses Younan, with various anarchists and Marxists. The group's initial formation was sparked by Henein's encounter with the Italian Futurist Filippo Marinetti. Marinetti was born in Alexandria, Egypt which, at the time, had a large Italian population. He left to attend the Sorbonne in Paris but eventually returned for the first time in 1930 to give a series of lectures on Futurism to the city's Italian-Egyptian community. He returned for a second time in 1938 to give a lecture on Futurism at Les Essayistes literary club in Cairo on March 24. Henein, Jean Moscatelli and Georges Santini were in attendance and caused an uproar in opposition to what Marinetti preached. The night quickly descended into chaos and Henein, Moscatelli, Santini (and other writers later involved with Art et Libert√©) eventually broke away from their associations with Les Essayistes club, which they had been involved with for several years, due to the club‚Äôs gradual alignment with Marinetti and fascism. Most of the group's members were not Egyptian-born but foreign \\"Egyptianized\\" residents known as mutamassirun. What distinguished Art and Liberty from previous Egyptian art movements was their embrace of cosmopolitanism and universalist ideas. Artists like Mahmoud Mukhtar and Mahmoud Sa'id have become known for their artwork which depicted local Egyptian life. They often employed nationalist symbols of the fellahin and ancient Egypt. Their work has been revered as the epitome of an Egyptian national style and they were considered \\"national heroes\\". Art and Liberty formed in opposition to this nationalist sentiment which was growing in early twentieth century Egypt. Since 1881 up until 1952, Egypt had been under British occupation. A nationalist sentiment was brewing at the time which started out as being anti-British but eventually became anti-foreigners. This ultimately harmed the Art and Liberty group since most of its members were either foreign-born or children of mutamassirun. Under the leadership of Gamal Abdel-Nasser, most of the mutamassirun were forced out of the country because of a hostile government.  Long Live Degenerate Art!  The Egyptian surrealists adopted the term ‚Äúdegenerate‚Äù as a badge of honor. Originally used by the Nazi Party as a way to ridicule art which they felt stood against the fascist ideals of the state. In 1937 they held the ‚ÄúDegenerate Art Exhibition‚Äù which displayed works of modern art. Over 700 artworks which had been confiscated and seized by the Nazi Government, mainly Cubist, Dada and Surrealist, were shown with derogatory slogans painted on the walls. The Long Live Degenerate Art! manifesto aligned itself with the modern artists whose work was being seized, censored and/or destroyed by the Nazi Party. Such artists mentioned in their manifesto include Pablo Picasso, Paul C√©zanne, Paul Klee, and George Grosz. As well, a reproduction of Picasso's Guernica was included in its first printing. The manifesto called for free expression which they felt was being threatened by fascist governments and growing nationalism. It urged artists and writers to embrace the title of \\"Degenerate\\" art in the face of nationalism. It was first published in both Arabic and French, which further established the group's cosmopolitan stance and their influence in European Surrealism.  Group Exhibitions  Over the course of their ten year run, Art and Liberty organized five groups shows and individual one-man shows.  First Show  Their first show was held at the Nile Gallery in Suliman Pasha Square in February 1940. The show was name \\"Independent Art\\" in reference to the \\"Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art\\" signed by Andr√© Breton and Diego Rivera but most likely written by Breton and Leon Trotsky. Georges Henein submitted a work titled \\"The Murdered Poet.\\" This would be the first and last time Henein exhibited a work of art since he was, first and foremost, a writer. Most of the artists exhibited were under thirty years old and many of them under twenty five. The first show represented a fresh, new approach to art that had not yet been seen by the Egyptian public. Their show was described as a \\"violent revolution against order, beauty, and logic.\\" Ahead of the shows opening, nearly ten thousand pamphlet invitations were distributed in order to attract the largest number of \\"educated youth.\\" The group continued this practice of distributing large numbers of invitations for their other group shows. In one of the pamphlets entitled \\"We Are Still in Turmoil\\", Ramses Younan published his translation of Arthur Rimbaud's \\"A Season in Hell.\\" Artists exhibited included: Georges Henein, Ramses Younan, Kamel el-Telmissany, Fouad Kamel, Aida Shehata, Mohammed Sadek and Angelo de Riz with a contribution from Mahmoud Sa'id.  Second Show  Their second show was held the year after in 1941. Its concept was more conceptual and experimental compared the first show. The interior was described as such: Pots of paint and plaster were scattered here and there... Fastened on the walls were hand silhouettes pointing towards an open door from which loud humming was escaping.\\" The exhibition was constructed like a maze, \\"set up in the shape of a mysterious passageway.\\" Paintings were hung on the walls in unorthodox ways with clothespins and a hangman's noose. The show was met with harsh reviews, particularly on the part of Jean Bastia who described the show as childish and accused its organizers of not taking the show seriously. However, the larger Cairo public enjoyed the shows ingenuity and considered the show a success. \\"Mohammed Sadek wrote: The opening was gratifyingly successful, to the point that we consider the Cairene public, which is accustomed to academic art of greater artifice, took genuine notice of this show. So we must heartily congratulate Mr. Georges Henein, the instigator of this group of youths.\\" The second show had more contributors than the first show and even included a photography section. Artists exhibited included: all the artists from the first show, Raymond Abner, Laurent Marcel Salinas, Eric de Nemes, Anne Williams, Art Topalian, Miss Behman, Amy Nimr, Hassia, Mrs. Baroukh and Abu Khalil Lutfy.  Third Show  Art and Liberty's third group show occurred between Thursday May 21-30 at the Hotel Continental in Cairo in 1942. Ahead of it opening, Georges Henein wrote an article titled \\"Message of Free Art\\" in which he encourages the modern artist to persist in the face of fascist regimes that wish to stifle them. Before its opening, a new journal was published to accompany the show stating: \\"This show has exceptional value, in that it includes for the first time the works of some of the eminent artists of Syria and Lebanon. This is a new and gratifying indication of the connection between artists of the sister lands.\\" The show was celebrated for exhibiting works which primarily dealt with themes and subjects of the working class, a far cry from the elitism of academic art. \\"The Labour\\" newspaper wrote: \\"The themes of this school are for the most part the working classes... the disciples of this school avoid themes of the privileged classes with their sumptuous halls, luxuries and fineries.\\"  Fourth Show  The fourth show, titled \\"For Independent Art,\\" was held on Friday May 12th, 1944 in the dining hall of the Lyce√© Francais School on Hawayaty Street in Babelouq, Cairo. It lasted till May 20 or 22, 1944 and exhibited 150 works of art including painting, sculpture and photography. The art critic Richard Mouseiry for the newspaper Le Progr√©s Egyptien praised the group for pulling off the exhibition despite several obstacles that stood in their way. Artists exhibited included: Mahmoud Sa'id, Fathy el-Bakri, Fouad Kamel, Samir Rafei, Saad el-Khadem, Rateb Sidik, Angelo de Riz, Suzy Green, Art Topalian, Aidabel, Hassia, and the Surrey brother who contributed photographs. As well, it was Ramses Younan's final exhibition with the Art and Liberty Group. Samir Gharieb explains that not all of these artists were \\"surrealist\\" artists. Instead, what tied them together \\"was the belief in and practice of the spirit of freedom and renewal in art.\\"  Fifth Show  The fifth and last group show organized by Art and Liberty was held on Wednesday May 30th, 1945 and lasted through June 9th. This show is described as being \\"simpler and less peculiar\\" than their previous shows, possibly foreshadowing the disbanding of the group only a couple of years later.

The hotel is managed by Palace Entertainment who also owns the Dutch Wonderland amusement park across from the hotel, with the hotel's name license from Warner Bros. (the owners of Cartoon Network). This also marked Cartoon Network's second entry into the hotel business after the Cartoon Network themed area in a Taiwan hotel called Hotel Cozzi. It also marked the second time that a kids cartoon channel (uncounting Disney) had entered into the hotel business in the US since the rebrand of Orlando, Florida's Holiday Inn Family Suites to Nickelodeon Family Suites by Holiday Inn in 2003 (the hotel is now Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites - Waterpark). The hotel opened on January 10, 2020 and it consists of 165 remodeled hotel rooms, a new resort style pool, kids play area, indoor arcade, coffee lounge, full bar, and a gift shop with Cartoon Network related merchandise.  History   As Continental Inn  The Cartoon Network Hotel began as a small family owned hotel called Continental Inn. The hotel consisted of 165 hotel rooms along with a tennis court, outdoor pool and splash area, free breakfast, an indoor pool along with a game room in a separate building called a \\"Pool House\\" and a fitness room. It operated until January 2018 when Palace Entertainment, the owners of nearby Dutch Wonderland, purchased the hotel for $4.7 million with the intention of remodeling it into a family friendly resort.  Announcement of new hotel  In October 2018, it was announced a partnership was made between Turner's then owned Cartoon Network and Palace Entertainment to convert the former Continental Inn into the first Cartoon Network Hotel and it would be open in Summer 2019. But in Summer 2019, It didn't made its opening because it was still under construction. In March 2019, despite the dissolution of Turner Broadcasting System, the new hotel retained the Cartoon Network brand with an agreement with Warner Bros., which became the new owners of Cartoon Network that same month. In November 2019, Palace Entertainment made an announcement that the release date was moved into sometime in Summer 2020, after that announcement, the Cartoon Network hotel added many more details of the hotel. Soon, they moved the original Summer 2020 date to January 10, 2020.  Incidents  In August 2017, the hotel, then known as Continental Inn, suffered a mechanical fire near the indoor pool around 4:20 PM, and the fire spread, until firefighters extinguished it quickly. During the fire, 2 firefighters were hospitalized for chlorine inhalation. Damage from the fire was estimated at about $250,000.  Hotel Renovations  During this time, the elevators, and interior were being renovated, along with renovations to the outer part of the hotel. In such activity, this made the resort feel a bit more immersive to the guests, as it had more for them to do and see, along with the theming.

It is based on the manga series Itazura na Kiss and stars Lin Yun as Yuan Xiangqin, a regular schoolgirl from the F class, and Darren Wang as Jiang Zhishu, a smart student in the A class.  Plot  The film opens as Jiang Zhishu is riding on his bike. Yuan Xiangqin walks past Jiang Zhishu and trips on the stairs, taking along Zhishu's phone. As Jiang Zhishu tries to figure how to save Yuan Xiangqin and his phone from breaking, Xiangqin reluctantly grabs on to his tie and their lips meet, signaling their first meeting. She then meets Jiang Zhishu again at a school assembly as he talks about his ongoing project in Boston, and finds out he's an extraordinarily smart person with a 200IQ score in the A class. Two years later, she is still fawning over Jiang Zhishu, over his social media page. Whilst trying to get rid of the F class for bees, she sees a social media update for his account saying that he's walking back to the A building and hundreds of fans including herself start running. As the A class gate closes, she has an ultimatum to confess to him. Later on in F class, she notices that a fire drill will start, shutting down all technology and thus allowing her to get through the A gate. She runs, finds Jiang Zhishu and confesses, to which he cold-heartedly rejects. All students in the A grade recorded this embarrassing moment and thus make fun of Yuan Xiangqin whilst the principal scolds her for wasting Zhishu's time. Xiangqin's house later collapses due to poor construction, combined with the previous confession, she is the centre of everyone's attention. As Jiang Zhishu walks past, Xiangqin challenges Zhishu that an F grader can get on the top 100 list for a trial exam. He agrees. Xiangqin moves in to her father's friend's house, without knowing that it is where Jiang Zhishu resides. Over the course of time, Xiangqin and Zhishu get closer through Zhishu's mother where she encourages their relationship and encounters at school and at his house. To save Xiangqin from embarrassment over not making the top 100, she begs Zhishu to help her study for the mock exam which he reluctantly agrees to due to her having an embarrassing video of his received by his mother. She makes 100th tied, whilst Zhishu still remains 1st. Zhishu and his cohort then embarrasses Xiangqin at an athletics carnival as she is revealed to reside in Zhishu's house, into which she streams the embarrassing video of his at his house. Xiangqin and Zhishu then quarrel before Zhishu kisses Xiangqin on the lips before leaving. Two years later, Xiangqin is seen to support Zhishu at Zhishu's mother's request but is left out of his life as Zhishu wants to live his own life and become a veterinary doctor. Xiangqin follows Zhishu around, only to see another woman living at his apartment but finds out that she is there for business only. She is relieved and Zhishu kisses Xiangqin one more time before finding out his father becoming sick and thus takes over his business, adding stress and pressure to his life. Caring for Xiangqin but prioritizing the business, he throws away Xiangqin in order to marry another woman to merge their businesses and thus save his father's business. Xiangqin then promptly rejects his love and runs away. Zhishu's father and mother disagree with Zhishu's decision to marry and tells him it should be from his heart whom he should marry. Another year passes by, and we see Xiangqin looking through Zhishu's social media. Zhishu then posts an update at the school hall in which he will talk at an assembly, in which Xiangqin goes to reluctantly. She then enters the hall and sees that no one is there but him. Zhishu then hides away and Xiangqin calls Zhishu's brother, into which he responds that only certain people can see what he posts. She then realizes that the posts were meant for her. Zhishu then proposes to Xiangqin in which she agrees. A flashback occurs at the end in which Zhishu wakes up from his slumber during his time where he tutors Xiangqin and sees the love letter Xiangqin wrote for him. At that time, the audience finds out that Zhishu was in love with her. Their subsequent marriage is seen in the post-credits scene.

Historical racing  Kentucky's current gambling laws only allow for betting on horse racing. For this reason, there are currently no casinos in Louisville, Kentucky. At Derby City Gaming, visitors will not find slot machines or table games like Poker or Blackjack, but instead historical racing machines. Historical horse racing machines are similar in looks to slot machines and play much like slot machines but are allowed under Kentucky gambling laws.

It comes from the words coatl meaning serpent and tepantli meaning wall. It is an architectural motifLeonardo L√≥pez Luj√°n, Alfredo L√≥pez Austin. \\"El coatepantli de Tenochtitlan.

Purpose  There is no consensus on the purpose of these walls. Many researchers have suggested that the coatepantli were used to mark the boundary between ceremonial and non-ceremonial land, and at times the word has been used to signify any wall which encloses a sacred space, notably in Tlatelolco. Recent research disputes this and suggests that they varied in their nature, but they were not explicit boundaries between the sacred and the secular. Tula|142x142px  Examples  Only three coatepantli are known to exist. The oldest was constructed at the Tula site between 950 CE and 1200 CE. The Tenayuca and Tenochtitl√°n coatepantli were constructed around 1500 CE. It is believed that the Tula coatepantli was the prototype for the others. Aside from the location and date of their construction, these walls are distinct in their forms as well.  Tula  The 36-meter-long coatepantli of Tula depicts, in bas relief, serpents appearing to devour skeletal figures. Some sources describe the figures as leaving the mouths of the snakes, and others describe them as being carried by the snakes. Lintel stone from Yaxchilan depicting a man emerging from the mouth of a vision serpent. Originally the background and flesh of the skeletal figures was painted red. The serpents were painted either blue or yellow in an alternating pattern. The teeth of the serpents and the bones of the skeletal figure were white. One interpretation of these carvings is that the snakes represent the earth consuming the dead or the need for human sacrifice to appease the gods. Another theory asserts that the skeletons are representations of past kings or warriors and that the serpents, rather than being symbols of the earth, are rather markers of royalty.Jordan, Keith. \\"Serpents, skeletons, and ancestors?: The Tula coatepantli revisited.\\", Ancient Mesoamerica. 24. 243-274, retrieved on 5 March 2019. Jorge R. Acosta, the discoverer of the coatepantli at Tula believed the skeletal figure was a representation of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the Lord of the Dawn, who was often depicted with a skeletal face. Analogs to the iconography found at Tula can also be found at Pre-Columbian Mayan sites such as Chichen Itza and Yaxchilan.144x144px  Tenayuca  The wall at Tenayuca is 170 meters long and features 138 sculpted rattle snakes on three sides of the base of the temple pyramid. The snakes on the east and west side were painted green to represent the god of rain and fertility Tl√°loc. The snakes on the north side were painted red and black to represent the war god Huitzilopochtli. Similar to the coatepantli of Tula, the wall here is believed to be represent fire and regeneration. Coatepantli at Templo Mayor in 144x144px  Tenochtitl√°n  Based on second-hand accounts, the wall at Tenochtitl√°n was thought for many years to have enclosed the entirety of the sacred precinct of Tenochtitl√°n and consist of numerous snakes, but archaeological work in 1981 revealed that the sacred precinct of the city extended beyond the coatepantli and that the coatepantli consisted of two walls in the form of large snakes with painted heads, surrounding the Templo Mayor. One snake was situated to the north of the temple and was painted blue to represent the rain god Tl√°loc. The other, around the southern side of the pyramid, was painted ochre and represented the war god Hitzilopochtli.

The entire south side of the first part of the street (to Bremerholm) is occupied by the Magasin du Nord department store. History Narrow houses on the south side of the street Gedde's district map The street was created in the 16th century when the king redeveloped a portion of the garden of King John's Wine House in Ving√•rdsstr√¶de. A row of narrow houses were constructed along the south side of the new street and let out to civil servants and lower-ranking court employees such as skippers and carpenters. It was known as the \\"King's Long Row\\" (Danish: Kongens Lange Boder). The street was initially simply called Kongensgade (King's Street) but received its current name when Ny Kongensgade was renamed Store Kongensgade (Great King's Street) to prevent confusion between the two streets. It is unclear exactly when the name change occurred. The street painted by Christian Olavius Zeuthen The Skippers' Guild House was from 1665 located in the street (No. 33). The building was a half-timbered Rrnaissance-style building from 1606 with a large system of courtyards and rear wings . The Skippers' Guild sold the building in 1804 and relocated to the corner of Bremerholm and Holmens Kanal. The building in Lille Kongensgade was demolished in 1881/82. Many of the buildings on the north side of the street were rear wings associated with properties on the more prominent main street √òstergade. An example was A. C. Gam√©l's property at √òstergade 27 (then 20) and Lille Kongensgade 33. It operated the first coffee roastery in Copenhagen in the courtyard. Vr√∏drene Andersen, a manufacturer of gentlemen's clothing, was located at No. √òstergade 7-9/Lille Kongensgade 8-10 from 1916. Magasin du Nord purchased and demolished the houses at No. 3-11 in around 1910 to pave the way for an extension of the department store which was inaugurated in 1914. The rest of the houses on section between Kongens Nytorv and present-day Bremerholm were acquired in 1911. The four buildings at No. 23-29 were replaced by a low, one-storey extension. The small square Magasins Torv was created around the same time and this gave Magasin du Nord a second entrance which was visible from Str√∏get. The one-storey extension was heightened in 1959 and again in 1964. Notable buildings The buildings at No. 4, 6, 16 and 34 are listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. No. 6 is from 1767 and houses the restaurant Skindbuksen. The building is nine bays wide and is crowned by a three-bay dormer. The four-bay townhouse at No. 6 was built over three storeys for metalsmith Ulrich Grab in 1675 and later heightened with one storey in 1770.

The series is a remake of Nazar, which airs on Star Plus. The show stars Sampurna Lahiri, of Tara Ami Chokhe Dekhini fame, who is making a comeback with Nojor after 10 years and it stars her in a negative role. The show also stars actress Diya Mukherjee and actor John Bhattacharya in lead roles and Antara Pakira Nandi in a pivotal role. The series follows the Singha Roy family and the various struggles they face under the evil eye of a daini named Maya. It was ended due to low TRP ratings. Plot The plot is about an evil entity called Maaya who is a daini and bewitches the Singha Roy family, and the struggles the family experience under her nojor. The story revolves around Maya, a 200 year old life-force sucking vampire-like creature called daini who also uses \\"jaadu tona\\" (witchcraft). Maaya kills people to steal their age (vitality) which keeps her young and beautiful. She enchants and captivate Dev Singha Roy by her surreal beauty, after which they marry and have two children,Ayush and Ananya. Maya wins Dev's favour by helping him a mass great wealth through black magic while she gradually drains his vitality that leads to his premature death. Maaya also kills Dev's mother to hide her secret identity but the Singha Roy grow suspicious anyway. A worried Debashree Sigha Roy tells of her fears to her friend Shivani (Ishani's mother), a psychical wizardess and a Reevaavanshii (monster-hunter) who comes to help Dev's bedevilled family and ward off the evil eye. She cuts Maya's plait rendering her powerless, Maya then escapes into the woods, but they pursue her along with a mob of villagers holding torches. Once cornered, Maya was set on fire which turns her into stone. Yet Maya's evil eye (nojor) still lurks on the family as she is a unique and very powerful daini called \\"Akaayan\\". Debashree and Singha Roy (her husband) adopt Dev's children Ayush and Ananya.  18 years later  Ayush and Ananya grow up with their cousins Riddhi and Disha and go to a college in a city, far from the village of Sundar pur. Ayush discovers his superpowers, but is unaware that he is a \\"Daanush\\" (the hybrid offspring of a daini and a human). He can be saved from turning to the dark side only by a girl who has the \\"Devi-Maa\\" Durga's symbol as her birthmark, and is referred to as the Doibik (divine conduit). Ishani, has the symbol of the Devi-Maa behind her neck. Sparks fly between Ayush and Ishani though they didn't see each other. Ishani who is in search of her lost mother, comes across her father, Akhilesh,who is a professor and a \\"Revaavanshi\\" (member of a clan of monster-hunters) and her sister 'Indu'. Maya sends a puppet daayan, Tina with a fake Durga symbol to marry Ayush, So that Maya can return and also to keep the family from knowing the real doibik.Ayush and Debrashree come under Tina's control during which Tina and Ayush get married while the rest of the family is spellbound and cast into a deep sleep. The marriage releases Maaya from the charms and spells that imprisoned her. The Signa Roy family reunites with Maaya, and Ayush learns about his real mother. Vashkor, Ishani's childhood friend and obsessive lover, attempts to marry Ishani by taking advantage of his unwell mother, a visually challenged priestess, Guru Maa, who raised Ishani after Shivani's disappearance.Fearing Ayush's budding romance with Ishani, and the growing ties and bonds of the Singharay with Ishani, Maya sends a message summoning an asur named \\"Kalantakasur\\" from \\"Paathaal-Lohk\\" to scare Ishani away. Kalantakasur gets enraged on Maya for cutting his daughter Tina's plait. To Maya's horror, Kalantakasur was goring and pounding Ayush not Ishani, Ayush fought back with his Daanush superstrengths without success. A distressed Ishani invokes the Devi-Maa for help, who swiftly heeds to her plea. Ishani enters a tranced religious dance (Thaandov) and manifests her Doibik form complete with Durga's attire, multiple arms and ashtraas. Initially, the beast seemed invincible despite multiple strikes, but after Maya tells Ishani the demon's achilles heel, she smites him dead with her trishul. Everyone witness the battle and learn that Ishani is the real Doibik.Maya plots again to separate the family from Ishani, she reveals to Ishani that she has trapped her mother Shivani in the form of a bird and threatens to kill Shivani if Ishani doesn't marry Vashkor, but Ayush interferes and stops the marriage again . Later, Ayush learns about his Daanush self. Maya proves herself as Deboshree's half sister by merging her magical plait with Deboshree's plait which shocks all and frightens Sathi. A few days later, Vashkor gains the abilities of a daayan by wearing Tina's cut- off plait and terrorises the Singha Roy family all night to get Maya's plait, but Deboshree revitalises a temporarily weakened Maya by letting daylight into the room at dawn, and saves the whole family.The Singharoy face new challenges after Indu is hypnotised by Maya, and releases Rhimjhim a petni (evil spirit) to hatch a new conspiracy to separate Ishani and Ayush. Rhimjhim makes a \\"Bhasyachakra\\" (hex) to capture Ishani and Ayush but Ishani saves Ayush and finds herself trapped inside Rhimjhim's hex. Later at home, Ayush notices Ishani's unusual behaviour and recognize her to be Rhimjhim. He makes Rhimjhim dance in joy with Maya's help due to which Rhimjhim's \\"Bhasyachakra\\" breaks, freeing Ishani.Maya agrees for Ayush and Ishanis marriage and frees Shivani, who is later revealed to be \\"Sorpini\\" (naagin) and eventually kills her before which Shivani transfers her serpentine powers to Ishani.Ayush and Ishani get married. Later Ishani learns about Maya's real motive of wanting to feed on Ayush on the day of \\"Rakt-Chandra Grahan\\" or (Red Moon eclipse) to become immortal. Ishani falls into an Indefinite sleep and enters \\"Trishanku-Lok\\" (dimension between the living and the dead). With the Daivik gone, Ayush turns to the dark side and becomes an extremely powerful daanush who cares for himself but no one else.However Ishani returns with the help of a \\"Trinetra- mani\\" (a gem powered by Shiva's third eye), and brings Ayush back from the darkness. Finally, Ishani exposes Maya bad intentions to Singha Roy's after which Ayush expels Maya from their flat. Later Ishani and Ayush consummate.Enter Dola , Maya's twin sister and Tina's mother, a \\"Dukaayan\\" (two-headed daayan) who rules the \\"Swapna-Lohk\\" (dream world) unleashes horror. Tina denies to help Dola and hence the latter enters the real world through a \\"sleep portal\\", she frightens the singharoy and threatens to kill Ayush. With Akhilesh's help, the Singharoy attack Dola using \\"Makarketh\\" flowers on the muhurta of Makar Sankranti killing her in the process, however Dola is revived by Maya. The sisters fool Ishani into transferring her serpentine powers to Ayush. Believing that Ishani is devoid of powers, the sisters take advantage of the opportunity and try to burn her alive using a special fuel called \\"Tharal-agni\\". Ishani invokes Devi-Maa for help, who sends her vaahan to rescue Ishani, She quickly assumes her daivik form to slay the daayans. Mohana and Dola are turned into stone statues however they are freed by Tina to regain her powers. A \\"Sarp\\" (snake-man) hypnotises Ayush and steals his Sarpika powers. He disguises himself as Ayush and targets Tina's Trinetra- mani gem. Ayush and Ishani combine their powers and defeat the Sarp. To Maya's horror, She feeds on the serpent disguised as Ayush during the muhurta of \\"Red-moon eclipse\\" but having eaten a snake, Maya becomes a \\"Sarpayan\\" possessing combined powers. Dola shows Maya's horoscope which predicts that Ayush's child will put an end to her. The Singharoy celebrate Ishani's pregnancy. Ayush learns about Maya's intentions to kill Ishani and their unborn child.Realising the danger he poses, Ayush decides to separate from Ishani till the baby is born. With heavy hearts, Ayush and Ishani part ways for the sake of their baby. 6 months later Ishani gives birth to baby boy in an abandoned Shiva Temple. The Singharoy and Akhilesh come to see the newborn and affectionately call him \\"Gopal\\". Maya tries to kill Gopal several times, but in vain. Maya creates a \\"Vetaal-Mritkee Chakra\\" a cursed zone, whoever dies inside it becomes a \\"Vetaal-Mritkee\\" (zombie). Maya's unwittingly risks her life, the Mritkees attack and overpower her. Ishani and ayush managed to escape from vetaal mritkees and Maya shocked to see the powers of Gopal.

April 1692, Copenhagen) was a French sculptor and stonemason who worked in Sweden and in Copenhagen, Denmark. He is best known for creating the first equestrian statue in northern Europe. Life and work Little is known about Lamoureux's early years. He was born in Metz in the Lorraine region of France, and he had a younger brother Claude, also a sculptor, as well as a younger sister Magdalena, who was born in Hamburg (Germany) around 1660. Their father, whose first name is unknown, was a sculptor who had worked in the Netherlands, in England and in Hamburg, and might have been an assistant of the sculptor Fran√ßois Dieussart. Lamoureux first appears around 1664 in Stockholm with his stepfather, the sculptor Jean Baptiste Dieussart, when the latter entered service with count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, the Lord High Chancellor of Sweden, who was his stepfather's main employer and patron until around 1668. In the same year Lamoureux's mother, who was originally from Antwerp, died in Stockholm. In the years before 1668, Lamoureux (and presumably also his brother Claude) is believed to have been an apprentice or assistant of his stepfather. Around 1670 he was an apprentice of the sculptor Nicolaes Millich and lived with him in Stockholm's Bonde Palace, but absconded to G√ºstrow to his stepfather's brother Charles Philippe Dieussart, who at the time was court architect and sculptor of Duke Gustav Adolph of Mecklenburg, and in 1671 Lamoureux, like his stepfather before him, entered the service of count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. Early in 1675 Lamoureux married Anna Thiel, a daughter of Hans Thiel, farrier and Elder of the guild of weaponsmiths, and in 1677 he became court sculptor for Queen Hedvig Eleonora at Jakobsdal Palace, in September 1678 he was contracted by his former employer, De la Gardie, to create sculptures of two seahorses, a Neptune and a dragon for Karlberg Palace. In 1681, Abraham C√©sar Lamoureux and his family, including his brother Claude his sister Magdalena and her husband, the Swedish sculptor and stonemason Johann Gustav Stockenberg, moved to Copenhagen in Denmark (it has been speculated that Lamoureux was convinced to leave Swedish Service by Jens Juel) to become court sculptor for Christian V of Denmark, where he received an annual salary of 400 rigsdalers, which was topped up by an additional 200 rigsdalers from 1685. He is likely to have started work on the Equestrian statue of Christian V around 1682, when he first purchased materials for its creation, and 1687 its installation on Kongens Nytorv was witnessed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. Abraham C√©sar Lamoureux died in Copenhagen around April 1692 where he was buried in the Trinitatis Church on the 27th of April 1692. Most important works Original equestrian statue of Christian V, now displayed in The Lapidarium of Kings museum, Christian IV's Brewhouse, Copenhagen Unfortunately there do not seem to be any works completed by Lamoureux in Sweden that still exist. All of his known surviving works are located in Denmark: * the Equestrian statue of Christian V, erected between 1687 and 1688 at Kongens Nytorv and originally made from gilded lead ‚Äî the statue required frequent repairs due to metal fatigue caused by the softness of the lead, so the original statue was recast in bronze by Einar Utzon-Frank between 1939 and 1942 * a marble bas-relief portrait medallion of king Christian V at Rosenborg Castle Attributed works A number of other works have been attributed to Lamoureux. Among these are: * a marble bas-relief portrait medallion of Christian V at Gisselfeld * a Hercules statue from around 1691 at Borchs Kollegium, clearly inspired by the Farnese Hercules Literature   References Category:17th-century French sculptors Category:Danish Baroque sculptors Category:French Baroque sculptors Category:Court sculptors Category:Stone carvers Category:Stonemasons Category:People from Metz Category:1640s births Category:1692 deaths ","title":"Abraham-C√©sar Lamoureux"},{"id":"60149371","text":"Nilanjana Datta is an Indian-born British mathematician working in quantum information theory.

In the days following the 1964 Alaska earthquake, Selkregg helped organize a group of local geologists to gather important data about earthquake damage to inform future recommendations about building stability. She also helped promote earthquake safety, land preservation, and economic development in the Anchorage area.  Biography  Lidia Lippi was born in Florence, Italy, in 1920. Her father died when she was three years old, and she lived in Italy and North Africa with her mother and two brothers. During World War II, Lippi and her mother lived in Florence, Italy, where she worked as a nurse. She also joined the Italian resistance against the Nazis. Lippi married Fred Selkregg in 1945. They had three children: Alicia, Sheila, and Leif. Lidia Selkregg trained as a geologist. She received her doctorate degree from the University of Illinois in Champaign. The Selkreggs moved to Alaska in 1958. Lidia Selkregg worked as a planner in Anchorage. She wrote the Economic Development Administration Grant for the Port of Anchorage, and she fought to protect land for the Anchorage watershed. In the aftermath of the 1964 Alaska earthquake, the most powerful recorded earthquake in U.S. history, a small group of professional geologists, led by Selkregg, then a geologist with the Alaska State Housing Authority, were authorized by the housing authority and city officials to outline immediate courses of action. The Engineering Geology Evaluation Group was formed, consisting of a volunteer team of local geologists, engineering geologists, and soil scientists. Starting just two days after the earthquake, the group mapped the entire earthquake area and obtained aerial photographs of the damage. They also measured all of the vertical and horizontal displacements in the area. They released a preliminary report on April 14, 1964, and a final report on May 8, 1964. This report was later used by the Scientific and Engineering Task Force, appointed by the Federal Reconstruction and Development Planning Commission for Alaska, to make recommendations about stability in the wake of the earthquake. Selkregg also worked to get the population of Valdez to move away from the previous site of their town. In the years after the earthquake, she worked to raise awareness among the public about earthquake risk. From 1971 to 1985, Selkregg was a professor of resources and socioeconomic planning and regional planning at the University of Alaska Anchorage, where she developed a graduate planning program. She was the editor of the \\"Environmental Atlas of the Greater Anchorage Area Borough,\\" published by the University of Alaska in 1972. Selkregg served on the Advisory Committee to the Carter White House Conference on Balanced National Growth and Economic Development; she also served in the Anchorage Assembly. As a member of the Assembly, she helped create the city's network of trails and parks. Selkregg died on August 14, 1999. She was inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2009.

Andrija Raiƒçeviƒá (Tolac, a Herzegovinian village, Ottoman Empire, c. 1610 - Peƒá, Ottoman Empire, after 1673) was a Serbian icon painter and miniaturist who worked during the Ottoman occupation of the Balkan Peninsula. A well-respected artist, he undertook commissions for the Patriarchate of Peƒá and went to Bosnia and Herzegovina to paint icons for the iconostasis in the Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel in Sarajevo. He is noted for having painted Saint Nicholas in an abstract but traditional form. His icon is not influenced by Western art; St. Nicholas is presented in the Byzantine art style of the twelfth century and those that followed suit. All of his commissions came from the Patriarchate (Peƒá) or from high-ranking Serbian officials. The Monastery of the Holy Trinity of Pljevlja, also known as Vrhobreznica, was the largest rewriting center (Scriptorium) in Montenegro during the period of Ottoman rule. In the monastic brotherhood of the Holy Trinity, some of the most important achievements of Serbian manuscript literature from the Ottoman era were created. John the Exarch's Hexameron (a 15th-century Russian translation) and Cosmas Indicopleustes's Christian topography, hand-copied by Gavrilo Trojiƒçanin in 1649 and then illustrated by painter Andrija Raiƒçeviƒá, were a remarkable and significant undertaking of miniature painting in the seventeenth century. Raiƒçeviƒá was a relative of Mojsije, the abbot of the Monastery of the Holy Trinity. Over time, these two works in the same connection became especially recognizable by Raiƒçeviƒá's extraordinary illustrations. Today, Andrija Raiƒçeviƒá's works are on display in the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church and Regional Museum of Pljevlja (Zaviƒçajni muzej Pljevlja).

When completed, it will connect the town of Kikuyu to the town of Ruaka, both in Kiambu County. Location This road starts in the neighborhood called Gitaru, in the town of Kikuyu, approximately , north-west of the central business district of Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. The road travels in a general north- easterly direction through Wangige, Kahara, Ndenderu, Rumingi, to end at Ruaka, a total distance of about . At Ruaka, it will connect to the Nairobi Northern Bypass Highway. Overview This road is one of the four bypass highways built to direct motorized traffic away from the central business district of the city of Nairobi, to alleviate the perennial traffic jams on the city streets. The bypass highways include (a) Nairobi Northern Bypass Highway (b) Nairobi Eastern Bypass Highway (c) Nairobi Southern Bypass Highway and (d) Nairobi Western Bypass Highway. It is one of these four bypass roads that form a ring-road around the city. The Western Bypass development also involves the construction of of service roads and walkways measuring on both sides of the highway. A total of six interchanges and overpasses will be built, one each in the six townships where the four-lane dual carriageway is planned to pass. This way, the traffic on the highway will not interfere or be impeded by the surface traffic in the urban centers.

Platt was an American artist (born 1948, died January 20, 2019) and art professor. Platt was predominantly known as a printmaker and photographer. He was born, worked, lived most of his life, and died in Washington, DC.  Education  Platt received his degrees in Fine Art from the Columbus School of Art & Design in Ohio (BFA 1970), and Howard University (MFA 1973) in Washington, DC.  Work  Although Platt worked for years as a printmaker and photographer, his latest exhibitions in the last few years tended to be multi- media in nature. He taught at the Alexandria Campus of Northern Virginia Community College for more than 30 years and subsequently at Howard University for more than 10 years, where ‚Äúhe introduced digital photography and non-toxic printmaking into the school‚Äôs Fine Art curriculum.‚Äù He is considered by many to be one of the most influential DC artists and art professors of the last few decades. During his life he exhibited his artwork in solo and group shows in museums, art centers, and galleries in both the United States and other nations such as Australia, Viet Nam, Ukraine, Greece, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France. In 2003 Howard University‚Äôs James A. Porter Colloquium commissioned Platt to create the inaugural print for its 2004 conference. In 2004 he was part of the DC Print Portfolio Project, sponsored by the District of Columbia Commission on the Arts and Humanities. In 2006 Platt was commissioned to create work for the exhibition organized by the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History & Culture in Baltimore in collaboration with the Maryland Historical Society and the Maryland Institute College of Art for their multi-venue 2007 exhibit, \\"At Freedom‚Äôs Door: Challenging Slavery in Maryland.\\" In 2015, Platt and his wife, poet Carol A. Beane, exhibited Ritual +Time Travel = Rebirth: Images and Words by Michael B. Platt and Carol A. Beane at the Sonya Haynes Stone Center of the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, NC. Most recently, in 2019, ‚ÄúInfluences and Connections‚Äù, also an exhibition with his wife at the American University Museum, was described as: ‚Äúalthough not a retrospective, did become a sort of summation‚Äù of his career. A second reviewer noted that \\"Platt‚Äôs images are multifaceted, richly layered and textured, and require deep gazing to register all the elements present in just one piece.\\"  Collections  Platt‚Äôs artwork is in the permanent collections of the former Corcoran Gallery of Art (now transferred to the American University Art Museum), the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, the Library of Congress‚Äô Prints and Photographs Collection and its Rare Books and Special Collections, the Schomburg Research Center in Black Culture of the New York Public Library, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Harris Poetry Collection of the Rockefeller Library of Brown University, the David C. Driskell Center Collection of the University of Maryland, and the Hampton University Art Museum.  Press  Platt‚Äôs work was widely reviewed and received significant press attention during his career. For his most recent exhibition, which opened a few days after his unexpected death, The Washington Post wrote: ‚ÄúIn recent years, his imagination was sparked by the culture of a people who could hardly live farther away: Australia‚Äôs Aboriginal people.‚Äù A few years earlier, the same newspaper described his work as \\"striking.\\" In discussing his life, The Washington City Paper noted that the ‚Äú‚Ä¶story of Michael B. Platt‚Äôs life is longer than the 70 years he was physically on this earth; it contains the history of Jim Crow and of civil rights, to the point where we are at now. The thrust behind every technique the Platt used was the story of struggle, victory, and humanity; of blackness taking different forms in the world over, and the ability to characterize any person within that story with empathy and respect.‚Äù American art critic Donald Kuspit wrote: ‚ÄúAll of Platt‚Äôs works are aesthetic masterpieces, ingeniously integrating figuration and abstraction, light and shadow, planes of color and incisive line.‚Äù  Awards  Platt was the 1999 winner of the Washington, DC Mayor's Art Award for Excellence in Artistic Discipline, and also the Dorothy Frost Award for Digital Printmaking, Hampton University Museum, in 2008. He was also a 2007 recipient of the prestigious Franz and Virginia Bader Fund Grant.  References   External links  * Michael B.

It was organized by George Beirne Chapman and was mustered into Confederate service at Lewisburg on April 25, 1862, with 150 men recruited from Monroe County, Greenbrier County, Allegheny County, and Roanoke County. With little time to drill they were sent to Jackson River Depot, where they were issued a 24-pound howitzer, two 12-pound and two 6-pound cannons. They were assigned to Brig. Gen. Henry Heth's command and fought at White Sulphur Springs and Lewisburg on May 10 and 23, respectively. They were also part of Brig. Gen. William W. Loring's Kanawha Valley campaign in September 1862. They were then assigned to the command of Brig. Gen. William L. Jackson and fought in small engagements in mid-1863, at White Sulphur Springs Aug. 26-27, and Droop Mountain on Nov. 6. In December Jackson stationed them at Sweet Springs Mountain to block Brig.-Gen. William W. Averell's retreat from his raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, but Averell escaped by another route. They played an important part in the Confederate victory against Franz Sigel at New Market on May 15, 1864. They were sent to the defense of Richmond, fighting at Hanover Court House and along the Chickahominy River, and helping to halt the advance of Grant at Cold Harbor on June 3. They were then sent to the defense of Lynchburg, where they were joined by two other batteries, Lowry's and Bryan's. After Lynchburg, the battery was issued six new 12-pound Napoleon cannons and was assigned to the command of Jubal Early in late 1864. They fought at Monocacy, Snicker's Ferry, Opequan, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek. They suffered losses at the Third Battle of Winchester, where Cpt. Chapman was severely wounded, dying a week later from tetanus. Command passed to Lt. Frederick Thresher, and at his wounding the next week command passed to Lt. Henderson Reed. Opequan and Cedar Creek had a crippling effect on the battery. Their last engagement was the siege of Petersburg in March 1865. They were then ordered to turn over their equipment to other batteries and report to Richmond on March 17, 1865. The unit lost 13 men in battle, 15 to disease, 26 captured, and 28 in desertion.Mountaineers of the Blue and Gray, The Civil War and West Virginia, George Tyler Moore Center for the Study of the Civil War, Shepherd Univ., 2008, CD-RomSifakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Virginia, FactsOnFile, New York, 1992, pgs. 54-55 George Beirne Chapman was the son of Augustus A.

The National Weather Service office in Seattle rated the tornado as an EF2 following an on-site survey of the storm damage the day after the event. There were no fatalities or major injuries reported. This was the first tornado to have touched down in Western Washington since an EF0 tornado in 2017 near Monroe. Damage was most pronounced near the South Kitsap Regional Park. The tornado was the largest recorded in Kitsap County, and the 12th recorded F2/EF2 tornado to touch down in Washington since 1950. Washington state averages 2.5 tornadoes annually, but only 0.1 tornadoes in the month of December; the majority of these are rated EF0. Meteorological Synopsis The tornado was part of an atmospheric river event pointed straight at the Pacific Northwest causing $18 billion (2018 USD) of damage between December 10 and December 25. This system caused flooding, severe erosion, and widespread power outages. Washington Governor Jay Inslee sought funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for damages caused during the prolonged stormy period, including for the Port Orchard tornado. There was not a tornado warning issued for the storm that produced the tornado. The Storm Prediction Center placed the Kitsap Peninsula and nearby Olympic Peninsula under a risk for general thunderstorms for the day, but did not note a chance of severe thunderstorms for the region. The storm was a product of the Puget Sound Convergence Zone, a meteorological phenomenon that occurs when an incoming storm from the Pacific Ocean is forced around the Olympic Mountains and then comes back together on the east side of the range. The nature of this convection makes it such that the bulk of the rotation was below above ground level, making it hard to see on Doppler weather radar imagery. Damage and Response Most of the damage from the tornado occurred near Salmonberry and Bethel Roads to the north of SR 160. There were approximately 250 homes damaged during the storm, including a few that had their roofs partially or completely ripped off. This number was lowered from earlier estimates of around 450 structures. Many large trees were snapped and uprooted, and several homes were also severely damaged when trees fell into them. Some of the most intense damage was inflicted to a dry storage facility, which sustained roof loss and collapse of numerous walls. A strip mall sustained considerable damage as well. About twenty homes were initially evacuated because of fears of a gas leak. Several roads were closed after the event, both because of debris on the roads and to limit access to damaged neighborhoods. Shelters were also opened to help victims affected by the storm.

This fragment is often preferred to MTL because some problems that are undecidable for MTL become decidable for MITL.  Definition  A MITL formula is an MTL formula, such that each set of reals used in subscript are intervals, which are not singletons, and whose bounds are either a natural number or are infinite.  Difference from MTL  MTL can express a statement such as the sentence S: \\"P held exactly ten time units ago\\". This is impossible in MITL. Instead, MITL can say T: \\"P held between 9 and 10 time units ago\\". Since MITL can express T but not S, in a sense, MITL is a restriction of MTL which allows only less precise statements.  Problems that MITL avoids  One reason to want to avoid a statement such as S is that its truth value may change an arbitrary number of times in a single time unit. Indeed, the truth value of this statement may change as many times as the truth value of P change, and P itself may change an arbitrary number of time in a single time unit. Let us now consider a system, such as a timed automaton or a signal automaton, which want to know at each instant whether S holds or not. This system should recall everything that occurred in the last 10 time units. As seen above, it means that it must recall an arbitrarily large number of events. This can not be implemented by a system with finite memory and clocks.  Bounded variability  One of the main advantage of MITL is that each operator has the bounded variability property. Example: Given the statement T defined above. Each time the truth value of T switches from false to true, it remains true for at least one time unit. Proof: At a time t where T becomes true, it means that: * between 9 and 10 time units ago, P was true. * just before time t, P was false. Hence, P was true exactly 9 time units ago. It follows that, for each t'\\\\in[0,1], at time t+t', P was true 9+t' time units ago. Since 9+t'\\\\in[9,10], at time t', T holds. A system, at each instant, wants to know the value of T. Such a system must recall what occurred during the last ten time units. However, thanks to the bounded variability property, it must recall at most 10 time units when T becomes true. And hence 11 times when T becomes false. Thus this system must recall at most 21 events, and hence can be implemented as a timed automaton or a signal automaton.  Examples  Examples of MITL formulas: * \\\\square\\\\diamond_{(0,1)}p states that there the letter p appears at least one in each open interval of length 1. * \\\\triangleright_{\\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}}p where \\\\triangleright_{\\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\}}p is the prophecy operator defined as \\\\square_{(0,i)} eg p\\\\land\\\\diamond_{(0,i]}p and which states that the first occurrence of p in the future is in i time unit. * p\\\\land\\\\square(p\\\\implies\\\\triangleright_{\\\\\\\\{1\\\\\\\\}}p) states that p holds exactly at each integral time and not anytime else.  Fragments   Safety- MTL0,‚àû The fragment Safety-MTL0,v is defined as the subset of MITL0,‚àû containing only formulas in positive normal form where the interval of every until operator has an upper bound. For example, the formula \\\\Box(a\\\\implies\\\\Diamond_{(0,1]}b) which states that each a is followed, less than one time unit later, by a b, belongs to this logic.  Open and closed MITL  The fragment Open-MTL contains the formula in positive normal form such that: * for each \\\\mathcal U_I, I is open, and * for each \\\\mathcal R_I, I is closed. The fragment Closed-MITL contains the negation of formulas of Open- MITL.  Flat and Coflat MITL  The fragment Flat-MTL contains the formula in positive normal form such that: * for each \\\\phi_1\\\\mathcal U_I\\\\phi_2, if I is unbounded, then \\\\phi_1 is a LTL-formula * for each \\\\phi_1\\\\mathcal R_I\\\\phi_2, if I is unbounded, then \\\\phi_2 is a LTL-formula The fragment Coflat-MITL contains the negation of formulas of Flat-MITL.  Non-strict variant  Given any fragment L, the fragment Lns is the restriction of L in which only non strict operators are used.  MITL0,‚àû and MITL0 Given any fragment L, the fragment L0,‚àû is the subset of L where the lower bound of each interval is 0 or the upper bound is infinity. Similarly we denote by L0 (respectively, L‚àû) the subset of L such that the lower bound of each interval is 0 (respectively, the upper bound of each interval is ‚àû).  Expressiveness over signals  Over signals, MITL0 is as expressive as MITL. This can be proven by applying the following rewriting rules to a MITL formula. * \\\\phi\\\\mathcal U_{(a,b)}\\\\psi is equivalent to \\\\Box_{(0,a]}\\\\phi\\\\mathcal U\\\\psi\\\\land\\\\Diamond_{(a,b)}\\\\psi (the construction for half-closed and closed intervals is similar). * \\\\Diamond_{(a,b)}\\\\phi is equivalent to \\\\Diamond_{(2a-b,a)}\\\\Box_{(0,b-a)}\\\\Diamond_{(0,b-a)}\\\\phi if 2a-b\\\\ge0. * \\\\Diamond_{(a,b)}\\\\phi is equivalent to \\\\Diamond_{(a,b-a)}\\\\Diamond_{(0,a)}\\\\phi if a. * \\\\Diamond_{(a,+\\\\infty)}\\\\phi is equivalent to \\\\Box_{(0,a)}\\\\Diamond\\\\phi. Applying those rewriting rules exponentially increases the size of the formula. Indeed, the numbers a and b are traditionally written in binary, and those rules should be applied O\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{b-a}\\\\right) times.  Expressiveness over timed words  Contrary to the case of signals, MITL is strictly more expressive than MITL0,‚àû. The rewriting rules given above do not apply in the case of timed words because, in order to rewrite \\\\Diamond_{(a,b)} the assumption must be that some event occurs between times 0 and a, which is not necessarily the case.  Advisability problem  The problem of deciding whether a MITL formula is satisfiable over a signal is in PSPACE-complete.

It premiered on 10 Peach in Australia and Channel 5 in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2019. The episode was written by series producer Jason Herbison and directed by Kate Kendall. It features the death of series regular Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) from ovarian cancer. She and her husband Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) take a road trip to the beach to spend the day with their children. It is mostly a two-hander between Morey and Moloney, a format which allows the focus to be on Sonya's final storyline. The episode was conceived after Morey was informed in March 2018 that her contract would not be renewed, in an effort to reduce the show's production costs. She asked for her character to be killed off, knowing there was no other plausible reason for Sonya to leave her husband and children. \\"Episode 8052\\" was filmed over a week in December 2018, after a production delay due to bad weather. Morey returned to film the scenes two weeks after she had wrapped her stint on the show. She said she was \\"satisfied\\" with Sonya's final scenes and believed she had done her character justice. Two promotional trailers featuring scenes from the episode were released in February 2019. \\"Episode 8052\\" posted a small ratings increase in Australia. It received positive reviews from critics and viewers, who praised Morey and Moloney's performances. Some viewers campaigned on social media for Morey to win a Logie Award. Maddison Hockey of TV Week called the episode \\"touching and beautiful\\", while Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy found it to be \\"gut-wrenching, tragic and incredibly difficult to watch\\". Plot Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) and her husband Toadfish \\"Toadie\\" Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) pack their car, as they prepare to join their children at a beach house. As Toadie goes inside to get his son's iPad, Sonya takes a moment to look at all the houses on Ramsay Street. They stop at the Lassiter's complex, where Toadie buys junk food and Sonya teases him about his secret food stashes. As they travel down the freeway, they sing along to some music before Sonya declares she does not want a funeral but a memorial by the lake instead. Toadie tries to assure her that they are getting the best treatment for her ovarian cancer, but Sonya wants to be prepared just in case. Toadie notices Sonya is looking nauseous. She says she is fine, and they joke about his domineering mother. Toadie wants to pull over. Sonya asks him to wait for the next rest area, but she has trouble remembering what it is called. Toadie pulls the car over next to a field and Sonya assures him she is just feeling ill from the chemotherapy and carsickness. While Toadie goes off to urinate, Sonya becomes dizzy and her vision blurs. Toadie later finds Sonya in the field picking wildflowers and they take a moment to admire the view. As they continue their journey, Toadie becomes concerned that Sonya is talking about a future that she is not part of. She becomes upset as she wonders what happens to people when they die and admits she is scared of not seeing him and the children again. Sonya finally tells Toadie that the chemotherapy has had no effect on the tumour in her brain, and she has days to live. Toadie experiences grief and anger. Sonya asks him to take her to the children. As they reach the beach house, Sonya promises not to give up. After learning their children are at the beach, Sonya becomes desperate to see them and they make their way there. Sonya starts feeling weaker and tells Toadie that he will have to let her go. She makes him promise to lean on his friends and family and take care of the children. She also urges him to find love again when he is ready. She sits and watches the children playing, while Toadie hugs her. As her breathing becomes shallow, Sonya says she knows that heaven exists because it is with Toadie and her family. Sonya falls limp in his arms. He tries to rouse her, but soon realises she has died. Production Conception In early December 2018, Neighbours announced that \\"a fan favourite\\" character would be killed off during 2019. The following month it was confirmed that Sonya Rebecchi, played by Eve Morey, would be diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer, which would eventually lead to her death. Morey said that the producers chose to write her character out to reduce the program's production costs. The show's future had been called into question when Network Ten entered voluntary administration in 2017. The producers informed Morey in March 2018, shortly after she returned to work following maternity leave, that her contract would not be renewed. She said, \\"There's no doubt that it was a hard decision to make, but that's just the way the job goes sometimes. Once I'd let go of my ego a bit, it ended up working out exactly the way it should.\\" After accepting that her character would be leaving, Morey wanted to know what would happen to Sonya and her husband Toadfish \\"Toadie\\" Rebecchi (played by Ryan Moloney), as she was keen \\"to preserve the integrity of these characters\\". Morey suggested that Sonya would have to die, as there was no other plausible reason for her to leave Toadie and their children, especially after everything they had been through together. Morey did not want her character to \\"go off the rails\\" and suffer an alcohol or drugs relapse again. That might have made her unpopular with viewers, who would not have cared as much about her death. Moloney came up with a final storyline for the character, which saw Sonya struck by a car as she hurried to meet Toadie, who had been given the all-clear after his own battle with cancer. The producers and writers, however, created the ovarian cancer storyline. Former Neighbours actress Kate Kendall directed the episode. \\"Episode 8052\\" was written by series producer Jason Herbison and directed by former Neighbours actress Kate Kendall. It is mostly a two-hander between Morey and Moloney. David Knox of TV Tonight called it \\"a rare move\\", as typical episodes feature the ensemble cast and multiple storylines. Morey was pleased that it was written as a two-hander, so that the focus would only be on Sonya's storyline. She told Katie Baillie of Metro, \\"Sometimes you can act your little guts off in a scene and then it will cut to the Waterhole‚Äîyou need light and shade otherwise some of these storylines can be too much, but it was great to know that this final episode was‚Äîthey weren't going to cut to Sheila doing something.\\" The plot sees Sonya and Toadie taking a road trip to the beach to join their children, shortly after Sonya learns her condition has deteriorated. Morey explained that Sonya is aware she has not got long to live, so she feels that she needs to \\"empower\\" Toadie to carry on without her. During the journey, Sonya's condition deteriorates, and she shares her last wishes with him, as well as questioning whether heaven really exists. Moloney said his character is \\"completely gutted\\" when Sonya tells him she is going to die soon. Upon reaching the beach, Sonya decides that the children should not see her and she lays in Toadie's arms, where she realises that being with her family is heaven. Morey added, \\"She dies content and grateful for the life that she's had, which is pretty ideal. Not a lot of people get that.\\" Filming The episode was filmed at an exterior beach location in December 2018. Moloney described filming the scenes as \\"horrible and beautiful all at the same time\\". He explained, \\"We went away for more than a week to shoot it all. The whole week was just horrible, but at the same time, it was nice that we got the chance to actually be in love for the last storyline.\\" Morey revealed that they were supposed to film the scenes earlier, but bad weather halted production. She returned to film them two weeks after she had wrapped her stint on the show. Morey found that the two-week gap gave her a better perspective on Sonya's final scenes, and allowed her to approach them in a different way. She also said that Kendall helped her and Moloney to \\"find the light and shade\\" in the scenes, so the characters are seen laughing and joking, just being together, before Sonya's last moments. Moloney commented that the final shooting day was \\"stunning\\", as the sun came out, and it felt \\"as if it was meant to be\\". Morey was \\"satisfied\\" with Sonya's final scenes and felt she had done her character justice. Promotion and broadcast Scenes from the episode were first seen in a promotional trailer for the show released on 22 February 2018. A second trailer, released on 25 February, asked viewers: \\"If you had one day left, how would you live it?\\", as scenes from the episode played. As the trailer ends, a voiceover is heard saying \\"It's time to say goodbye to Sonya\\". \\"Episode 8052\\" aired on 5 March 2019 in Australia and the United Kingdom. The cast, crew, and Fremantle Australia personnel held a private screening of the episode at Como Cinemas in South Yarra. Reception The original broadcast of \\"Episode 8052\\" was watched by 126,000 viewers in Australia, which was a small increase from the previous day's episode. In the UK, the episode failed to make the top 15 most watched television shows on Channel 5 for that week, but it was the highest rated episode of Neighbours across PC/laptop, tablet and smartphone users, and sixth overall behind episodes of The Bachelor. (User must select Channel 5 in the Channels field and then the appropriate date, device type and consolidation figures for the episode) The episode received positive reviews from critics and viewers, many of whom began campaigning on social media for Morey to win the Logie Award for Most Popular Actress. TV Week's Maddison Hockey wrote, \\"Sonya's sudden illness has been an emotional whirlwind that culminates in a touching and beautiful episode of Neighbours. Tears are guaranteed\\". Metros Katie Baillie called Sonya's death \\"the moment we've all been dreading\\" calling it \\"utterly heartbreaking\\" and \\"poignant\\". Laura-Jayne Tyler of Inside Soap wrote Morey and Moloney's performances were \\"sublime, and deserve to win every award going\\". Claire Crick of What's on TV also praised Morey and Moloney's performances, saying they \\"did us proud, as we knew they would.\\" She said the moment when Toadie learned his wife did not have long to live was \\"easily the most powerful Neighbours has ever seen, but in true Rebecchi style there also some light-hearted moments between the pair during the episode, reminding us why we love Sonya and Toadie so much.\\" Crick concluded that Sonya \\"was given the unforgettable send off that she deserves\\". A reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald felt Sonya's death was not as impactful as Molly Jones's (Anne Tenney) in fellow soap A Country Practice, but said it was \\"certainly a milestone\\" and found the cast and crew did it justice. The reporter added that Morey and Maloney \\"traversed the last hours of life with dignity, humour, and as much honesty as you can expect from a family-friendly prime-time soap.\\" Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opened his review writing, \\"Gut-wrenching, tragic and incredibly difficult to watch ‚Äì not descriptions you'd see for most episodes of sunshine soap Neighbours. But with the Aussie show killing off one of its most beloved characters today (March 5), we really wouldn't have expected anything less\\". He thought the episode was \\"a fitting send-off\\" for the character, and the two-hander format allowed the audience to see the couple at their best. Kilkelly also praised Morey and Moloney's acting. He said Moloney had given \\"the performance of his career\\". He also praised the cinematography, Kendall's direction, and the \\"sensational script\\" from Herbison. Kilkelly concluded by writing, \\"Take a bow, Eve ‚Äì your final episode, featuring performances on a par with any high-end drama, has shown exactly why everyone thinks they were mad to let you go\\". Herbison won the Best Script for a Television Serial accolade at the 2019 Australian Writers' Guild Awards. The following year, Kendall won Best Direction of a TV or SVOD Drama Serial at the Australian Directors Guild Awards for her work on the episode.

He turned the near-bankrupt Yuxi Cigarette Factory into one of China's most profitable state-owned companies and developed its Hongtashan cigarette into one of the country's most valuable brands. At its peak, the company contributed 60% of total revenues of the Yunnan provincial government. Chu supplemented his low official salary by taking bribes. He was arrested for corruption in 1996 and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1999. After being released on medical parole in 2002, he started his second company at age 75, an orange plantation with the brand name \\"Chu Orange\\". It became a nationally famous brand, giving Chu a new nickname as the \\"king of oranges\\". His achievements and unyielding spirit made him \\"one of China's most iconic entrepreneurs\\".  Early life  Chu was born on 17 January 1928 in Yuxi, Yunnan, Republic of China. He participated in the Chinese Communist Revolution in his youth, but was later denounced as a \\"rightist\\" during the Anti-Rightist Campaign, and was not politically rehabilitated until the end of the Cultural Revolution. He managed a sugar cane factory in his early career. Career  Yuxi Tobacco  Chu Shijian with his family in 1965 In October 1979, Chu was appointed head of Yuxi Cigarette Factory (later known as Yuxi Tobacco Company and Hongta Group). Yuxi was a near-bankrupt state-owned factory that made the Hongtashan (Red Pagoda Hill) brand of cigarettes, with an annual revenue of less than US$1 million. Chu recognized that as China's economy was starting to grow, more people could afford cigarettes, and he began to promote the Hongtashan brand all over the country. The brand became famous and demand grew quickly. Chu was able to sell the cigarettes for US$1.5 to $2 per pack, although the official price was fixed at $1. He spent the unreported profit on buying state-of-the-art equipment and building new offices and apartments for his employees. By 1995, the company produced more than 100 billion cigarettes per year but still could not meet the demand even at the higher unofficial prices. Wholesalers were willing to pay bribes to Chu and his family members to secure supplies of Hongtashan. While Yuxi Tobacco generated more than 99 billion yuan in profits and taxes for the government during his 16-year tenure, Chu's official monthly salary was less than US$250. He and his family members could not resist the temptation of augmenting their income by taking bribes. In February 1995, an informant sent evidence of the illegal payments to the government. Chu's wife Ma Jingfen () and their daughter Chu Yingqun () were arrested, and Yingqun committed suicide in prison. Chu was arrested in 1996. In 1999, he was convicted of embezzling US$1.74 million and diverting more than $145 million to company accounts from state coffers. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, although many considered it unjust and he remained a popular hero in Yuxi. His sentence was later reduced several times and officially ended in 2011.  Chu Orange  Chu developed diabetes while in prison and was released in 2002 on medical parole. Already 74, he decided to start his second company, an orange farm. In June 2003, he leased of land in Xinping County and hired 300 employees. He employed the same management methods as at Yuxi Tobacco, such as the emphasis of quality over quantity and linking workers' income to the company's profits. As the company grew, his employees were able to earn several times the average local wage. He used the Internet to market his \\"Chu Oranges\\" nationally, and attracted wealthier customers who were willing to pay higher prices for a premium brand perceived as nutritious and safe. The company became highly successful, selling 10,000 tons of oranges a year by 2013. He also developed his orange plantation in the Ailao Mountains into an ecotourism resort. Chu, already known as the \\"tobacco king\\" of China, gained another title as the \\"king of oranges\\". On 17 January 2018, his 90th birthday, Chu appointed his son Chu Yibin () as chief executive officer of Chu's Fruit Company Limited, while he retained the title of chairman.  Death  On 5 March 2019, Chu died from complications from diabetes at Yuxi People's Hospital. He was 91.

Made in 1971, Tignanello was one of the first red wines produced here without white grapes, and with the cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc grape varieties. Tignanello is regarded as an innovative pioneer of the modern Italian top wines, the so-called Super Tuscans, and has decisively shaped Italian viticulture. Background Tignanello has won international awards and has been included several times in the international top ten of the magazine Wine Spectator.\\"Tignanello e Ornellaia nella top ten dei vini mondiali.\\" Wine Spectator. 19 November 2007. The wine was produced for the first time in 1970 by Piero Antinori. It had the characteristic of combining Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc grapes and to be aged in a type of barrel called a barrique, leaving in fact the historical disciplinary of the Chianti Classico DOCG wines as established by Bettino Ricasoli. For this reason it lost the name DOC and remained the only generic indication of table wine until 1994 when it could boast of the Indicazione Geografica Tipica. After the first experiment in 1975, the white grape was completely removed. Now the composition is 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc and the gradation of 13.50%. This relationship between the grapes has been so since 1995 with the exception of the period 2001-2006 in which the Sangiovese rose to 85% at the expense of Cabernet Sauvignon which was decreased to 10%. In practice it was, together with Sassicaia, the precursor of Super Tuscan wines that have managed to obtain numerous awards all over the world.

Production and format In a Q&A; with Inside Radio, Flowers said that she and Prawat, her co-host, have been friends since birth. Flowers and Prawat, born on the same day, became friends through their mothers and grew up together; both became interested in true crime. \\"[You] can probably thank my mom for that, because I grew up reading Nancy Drew [and] Agatha Christie.\\" After joining the board of directors for Crime Stoppers of Central Indiana, Flowers hosted Murder Monday, a 20-minute show on RadioNOW 100.9 in Indianapolis. The show lasted a year, and was intended as promotion for Crime Stoppers to \\"improve the organization‚Äôs standing with a younger audience.\\" According to Flowers on WTHR, the name Crime Junkie came to her when she started working at Crime Stoppers. She felt that there weren't enough podcasts and decided to create one that she herself would enjoy. Flowers released the first episode of Crime Junkie in December 2017 and has posted weekly episodes since then. Flowers worked full-time at a hospital while still managing Crime Junkie, but in 2019 reported that she had made managing Crime Junkie her full- time job. Flowers says that each episode takes roughly 30 hours per week to research, write, edit, and prepare for release. Flowers does all of the research with the exception of a few episodes that Prawat has taken the lead on. Crime Junkie episodes typically have the same format. The episodes are about 30 minutes to an hour long. The cases covered include murder, missing persons, and serial killers. Flowers tells the story while Prawat adds her perspective. There is an extra segment once a month called \\"Pruppet of the Month\\" where Prawat tells stories about dogs who have been adopted. This segment is unrelated to the typical Crime Junkie content and inspired by fans who posted pictures of their dogs online. Flowers records the podcasts in her home office, and her brother, David Flowers, helps with the editing. The name AudioChuck came from Flowers' dog, Charlie, who barks at the end of every episode. Podcast episodes are released every Monday in the United States and Tuesday internationally. Flowers and Prawat have a Patreon page for the podcast that allows listeners to pay a monthly fee for extra content. While most cases are chosen by Flowers, they also take submissions where fans can suggest cases. Flowers and Prawat have taken Crime Junkie on tour to four cities in the United States. The Crime Junkie Live show consists of Flowers and Prawat telling case stories that have never been released on the regular podcast. Early reception Laura Barcella of Rolling Stone magazine named Crime Junkie among her favorite true crime podcasts for 2018. Jenni Miller of Vulture.com wrote that Flowers was \\"particularly passionate\\" in her coverage of the murder of April Tinsley with interviews with Tinsley's mother in a previous podcast and an interview with one of the people responsible for the arrest of the killer. In March 2019, USA Todays For The Win ran the 2019 Ultimate Podcast Bracket tournament in which Crime Junkie lost to Binge Mode in the Championship from a field of 32 podcasts. Kevin Chang Barnum from Podcast Review wrote a positive review and spoke highly of the research; the review was updated with a note after plagiarism allegations came to light. Plagiarism In August of 2019, multiple parties accused Flowers of plagiarism, the first of whom was writer and former reporter Cathy Frye. In a post made on the podcast's Facebook group, Frye alleged that the March 2019 episode about Kacie Woody relied heavily on her 2003 series of articles in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette without attribution. Flowers initially removed the episode after the allegations, per Frye's request. However, she later reposted it with source notes that linked to Frye's work but did not give verbal attribution in the episode. Following this reposting, Frye and the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette sent a cease and desist letter to the podcast, claiming further legal action would be taken if the episode was not updated to include verbal attribution or once again removed entirely. Once Frye accused Crime Junkie of stealing her content, it prompted other podcast makers to come forward with accusations of their own. Steven Pacheco of Trace Evidence posted a side-by-side comparison of the content of his episode on the disappearance of Asha Degree with that of Crime Junkie's, claiming his writing was used without credit. Robin Warder of The Trail Went Cold Podcast alleged the May 2018 episode on Henry McCabe \\"practically read... verbatim without credit\\" from his Reddit post. A Reddit user alleged that the March 2019 podcast on Kirsten Hatfield copied almost \\"word for word\\" from a 2018 episode of On the Case with Paula Zahn. Crime Junkie removed the episodes about Woody and Hatfield in August 2019, along with three other episodes. Flowers issued a statement that episodes had been taken down because \\"source material could no longer be found or properly cited\\" and addressed the accusations of plagiarism saying \\"Our work would not be possible absent the incredible efforts of countless individuals who investigate and report these stories originally, and they deserve to be credited as such. We are committed to working within the burgeoning podcast industry to develop and evolve its standards on these kinds of issues.‚Äù The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette noted that plagiarism controversy may have decreased Crime Junkie's audience, as it dropped from #1 to #5 in the Apple's true crime podcasts in August 2019. The Crime Junkie plagiarism controversy was named one of the top five plagiarism and attribution cases of 2019 by media news website iMediaEthics.

Based on the life of Laxmi Agarwal, it stars Padukone as an acid attack survivor alongside Vikrant Massey and Madhurjeet Sarghi. The film was Padukone's first after a two-year gap; she was last seen in Padmaavat. The film was announced on 24 December 2018 by Padukone on her Twitter account; it marks her first production venture. Filming took place from March to June 2019 in New Delhi and Mumbai. The film was theatrically released in India on 10 January 2020. The film was allowed by the government to be exhibited without payment of taxes in the states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. It received positive reviews from critics but did not perform well commercially. Plot A reporter named Alka meets Amol Dwivedi, the creator of a foundation for acid attack survivors, and informs him about Malti Aggarwal, one such survivor fighting for a ban on the sale of acid. Malti is looking for employment, and Amol employs her at his organization. In April 2005, Malti is attacked with acid in a busy market street in New Delhi. The police investigate ‚Äì based on Malti's and her boyfriend Rajesh's testimony, they suspect Basheer \\"Babbu\\" Khan, a family friend of Malti's, and his brother's wife Parveen Shaikh. The police arrest Babbu after triangulating his phone signal in the same area as the attack, while Malti undergoes a series of surgeries to reconstruct her severely damaged face. Malti's parents work as domestic help in Shiraz's house; she helps financially with Malti's treatment and hires Archana Bajaj to be her lawyer. Archana notes that acid attacks and burning someone with hot water come under the same section of the Indian Penal Code, so the punishment will be the same. In the first hearings, it is clear that Babbu and Parveen are guilty, as Malti's story is corroborated by witnesses and Parveen has the tell-tale burnt fingers from throwing the acid. However, as the law doesn't treat acid attack as a serious crime, Babbu is able to make bail and continue on with his life. Malti recognizes the need for a change to the law and regulations on acid sale, and she and Archana prepare a petition. Meanwhile, Malti's brother Rohit is diagnosed with advanced intestinal tuberculosis. In August 2009, the court sentences Basheer Khan to 10 years and Parveen Shaikh to 7 years of imprisonment, but they appeal to the High Court. Malti collects funds for treatment and legal action for other acid attack survivors. She eventually succeeds in having the penal code amended. In 2013, another acid attack in Mumbai claims the life of Pinky Rathore, which leads to public outrage and regulations on acid sale. Malti becomes the face of acid attack survivors and develops feelings for Amol. It is revealed that Basheer planned the acid attack on Malti in jealousy, and carried it out with help from Parveen. In October 2013, the Delhi High Court rejects Basheer's appeal, keeping the attackers in jail. The film ends with another acid attack in December 2013, and laments that despite the new regulations and media exposure, the frequency of acid attacks has not decreased, while acid is still bought and sold freely in India. The film is based on the real-life story of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.

On 7 January 2020, Padukone joined a protest-gathering at Jawaharlal Nehru University against the 2020 JNU Attack against left wing students and passage of CAA 2019. The visit angered BJP leaders who expressed it in social media. Soon enough, the hashtags BoycottChhapaak and BlockDeepika began trending in Indian Twitter with members of the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party contributing in its proliferation. In response, ISupportDeepika was floated which gained greater traction and by the end of the day, her follower count had increased significantly. Actor Varun Dhawan talked about similar calls for boycott of his film Dilwale, and stated that the boycott may hurt the business, so it is used as a scare tactics meant to prevent people from expressing their opinion in public. He supported Deepika in condemning the attacks stating it is wrong to not do it. On 8 January, social media users pointed out that filmmaker Meghna Gulzar had changed name and had changed religion of the rapists and the sisters/cousin of the rapists in the film. Online news portals like Swarajya and OpIndia wrongly reported that the name of the attacker who was a Muslim in real life, was changed into a Hindu name \\"Rajesh\\", in the film. BJP MP and Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Babul Supriyo called the change deliberate and \\"absolute hypocrisy\\". BJP MP from South Delhi, Ramesh Bidhuri made calls to public for a boycott of the movie. BJP MP Subramanian Swamy called it a defamation and informed legal action against the makers for this.Mumbai Mirror reported that in past the filmmakers making films based on real life incidents had the liberty to change the names as well as the storyline in their films. The visit to JNU by Deepika was seen by Mumbai Mirror as the reason for an aggressive stand taken against the film. These claims were debunked by the co founder of Newslaundry, Abhinandan Sekhri, who had watched a special screening of the film Chhapaak in Delhi. He stated that the claims of the attacker belonging to the Hindu religion were false, since the movie showed him as a Muslim. Journalist Radhika Sharma from PTI reported that Rajesh was the name of Malti's boyfriend. The acid attacker was called Bashir Khan urf Babboo in the film. Advocate Aparna Bhat, who represented Agarwal in the case fought at Patiala House Courts, pursued legal action against the makers for not mentioning her in the film, \\"to protect her identity and preserve her integrity\\".  Reception  On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 87% based on 15 reviews, with an average score of 6.96/10. Teo Bugbee of The New York Times reviewed that Chhapaak \\"succeeds in balancing extremes. It is at once a pleasing and buoyant inspirational story, and a realistic depiction of the brutal aftermath of acid attacks.\\" Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express credited the film for portraying \\"drama without dreaded melodrama\\" and highlighted Padukone's \\"solid, realised performance\\" to be its prime asset. Anna M.M.Vetticad of first post in a mixed review wrote, \\"The blend Massey achieves is what Chhapaak needed as a whole. Without that, what we are left with are good intentions, a heart in the right place, a major star taking a huge risk with an unorthodox role and a bunch of pluses that somehow do not come together to deliver an immersive experience.\\" Writing for The Hindu, Namrata Joshi summarised that \\"Padukone's performance and Meghna Gulzar's direction ensure that Chhapaak is like a splash that leaves you misty with emotions, if not entirely drenched\\". Ankur Pathak of HuffPost labelled it \\"a quietly powerful social commentary, a film that never allows you to be comfortable\\" and considered Padukone's performance to be a career best. Uday Bhatia of Mint wrote that it \\"earnestly highlights a depressingly common horror\\", adding that it \\"deals squarely with its subject without quite transcending it\\". In a mixed review, Anupama Chopra praised Padukone's performance but added that the film \\"hovers dangerously close to becoming a public service announcement. The messaging becomes bigger than the movie, which reduces the impact\\". Conversely, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com commended Gulzar for documenting \\"Chhapaaks grim reality barefacedly without losing sight of its character's quiet determination to fight the reasons that make such heinous crimes possible in the first place\\".  Soundtrack  The film's music is composed by Shankar‚ÄìEhsaan‚ÄìLoy while lyrics are written by Gulzar. Box office Chhapaak earned 4.77 crore at the domestic box office on its opening day. On the second day, the film collected 6.90 crore. On the third day, the film collected 7.35 crore, taking total opening weekend collection to 19.02 crore. , with a net of 40.57 crore in India and 14.87 crore overseas, the film has a worldwide collection of 55.44 crore.

() is a 1947 Chinese comedy film known as one of the best comedies of the civil war era. The film was directed by Sang Hu (Ê°ëÂºß) with a screenplay written by the famous Chinese literary figure Eileen Chang, the pair also collaborated on the 1947 film Unending Love (Bu Liao Qing, 1947). The film was produced in Shanghai by the Wenhua Film Company. Long Live the Missus! offers a satirical depiction of the lives of women, male-female relationships, and the institution of marriage in 1940s Shanghai. The film is an example of how the writer Eileen Chang interpreted the western comedy of manners for Chinese audiences.Lin Pei-yin (December 2016). \\"Comicality in Long Live the Mistress and the Making of a Chinese Comedy of Manners\\".

Chen Sizhen is a married woman in a middle-class Shanghai family whose well-intentioned white lies to help family members turn out to be increasingly counter-productive, leading to events that harm her marriage and her family finances eventually. Her husband, Tang Zhiyuan, launches a business with the financial support of his father-in-law, which Sizhen helps him secure. Feeling secure in his quick fortune, he falls prey to the seduction of a gold digger, Shi Mimi, and neglects his new company. As a result, his deputy embezzles all his money, and the company goes bankrupt. Despite his infidelity, he blames Sizhen for his misfortune and demands a divorce. Then, Sizhen forestalls an extortion attempt by outwitting Shi Mimi and bails her husband out of trouble. As a result, a grateful Zhiyuan changes his mind and wishes to cancel his proposed divorce. However, Sizhen decides that she wants to go through with a divorce anyway. At the last moment, however, Sizhen changes her mind and recommits to her marriage at the lawyer‚Äôs office. As the reconciled couple celebrate at a caf√©, they spot and observe Mimi using her seduction methods on a new man.Ng, K. (2008). The Screenwriter as Cultural Broker: Travels of Zhang Ailing's Comedy of Love. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, 20(2), 131-184. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/41482536  Production  Screenplay Eileen Chang has already been a well-known essayist and novelist in China before entering the film industry. She became a screenwriter because of the resistance that she faced in the literary circle due to her relationship with the top collaborationist official Hu Lancheng. Filmmaking then became an alternative way as both self-expression and employment since the film industry was struggling during the postwar period and was more tolerable of talents and celebrities' moral problems. In the 1940s, Shanghai's film industry saw high demand for domestically produced romantic tragedies and transplanted Hollywood love stories in local settings. Chang was aware of this trend, and noted that Chinese films at the time were \\"practically all on the subject of love‚Ä¶ Love which leads to a respectable marriage‚Äù. This film, addressing the topic of love, has been associated most strongly with Eileen‚Äôs philosophical vision expressing the plight of Shanghai's middle-class women within the home and her relationships (romance, marriage, and family).Fu, Poshek(2000). As a film script rarely written by women in this period or even in the early Chinese film history and the only surviving script of the two Chang wrote that year, Long Live the Missus! embodies the \\"role of female creators in the anti-film mechanism of 'male gaze' and the 'female writing' against the symbolization of women\\".Ji Hua-yue(2018).\\"ÁîµÂΩ±Á±ªÂûã„ÄÅÊÄßÂà´ËßÜËßí‰∏éÂΩ¢Ë±°ÊûÑÂª∫Ôºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊó©ÊúüÂñúÂâßÁîµÂΩ±‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ•≥ÊÄßÂΩ¢Ë±°Ôºà1949Âπ¥‰ª•ÂâçÔºâ\\" [D].‰∏≠ÂõΩËâ∫ÊúØÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢, P45 It marks Eileen Chang‚Äôs signature style of a tragic comedy with a bitter- sweet ending where the characters would experience a \\"little reunion,\\" but no grand finale like the audience usually anticipated. In a review of her own film Long Live the Missus!, Eileen Chang says the character \\"Sizhen's happy ending isn't all that happy.\\" She elaborates that the idea of \\"a bittersweet mid-life probably means there will always be small pains interwoven in the happy moments, but there are moments of comfort.\\" Sizhen's choice to reconcile with Zhiyuan might be seen controversial, especially because the \\"women's question\\" was at the center of the discussion during the Republican Era. Sizhen is not portrayed as the strong female character, who insists on her independence and pursues love. Just as Eileen Chang said, \\"I did not affirm or protect Chen Sizhen. I only mentioned her as such a person \\". Chen Sizhen's character as the protagonist is portrayed, which is exactly the starting point and foothold of all comedy effects of ‚ÄúLong Live the Missus!‚Äù as a comedy film.Ji Hua-yue(2018).\\"ÁîµÂΩ±Á±ªÂûã„ÄÅÊÄßÂà´ËßÜËßí‰∏éÂΩ¢Ë±°ÊûÑÂª∫Ôºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊó©ÊúüÂñúÂâßÁîµÂΩ±‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ•≥ÊÄßÂΩ¢Ë±°Ôºà1949Âπ¥‰ª•ÂâçÔºâ\\" [D].‰∏≠ÂõΩËâ∫ÊúØÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢, P45 And more importantly, mentioning Sizhen only as a person, Chang refuses to discuss the women's problem as \\"a reductive binarism of women against men, us against them, good against evil.\\" Such refusal has provided Long Live the Missus! the opportunity to subvert the mainstream discussion and cultural discourses at the time. Chang does not depict Sizhen as a mere female victim hurt by men, and even portrays Sizhen as a person who has the ability to establish relations inside and outside of the family. Chang explains her heroine: \\"cleverly deal s with people in a fairly large family. Out of consideration for the interests of the whole family, she nurses various grievances. But her suffering is almost nothing compared with the agonizing sacrifices Chinese women made in the old times... We should not look at her as a victim of the social system, since her behavior is out of her own free will.\\" Chang is aware of the discussion of the woman's question since the May Fourth Movement, and the women who suffered because of the social system, yet she believes that Long Live the Missus! could explore more potentials of the portrayal of female characters and stories. The themes and subjects of Long Live the Missus! are similar to those of Chang's wartime writings like Love in a Fallen City looking at the private space of love, marriage, family, and domestic conflicts. Long Live the Missus! integrates the Hollywood style comedy of ‚Äúpursuit of happiness‚Äù, Chinese traditional love stories, and tragic romance that involves courtship, marriage, and threats of divorce. Director Sang Hu considerably lightened the tone of Eileen Chang's original script of the film. Chang's original intention for the film was to create a more humanist film, affirming basic human nature in the form of a \\"silent drama.\\" However, to ensure its box office success, the film was made to be a \\"Hollywood-style comedy with coincidences and witty dialogues.\\"Hoyan, Carole (August 1996). \\"The Life and Works of Zhang Ailing: A Critical Study.\\" University of British Columbia, PhD Dissertation. pp. 253-255 Sound Sound technicians are Shen Yimin and Zhu Weigang. Shen also worked on Miserable at Middle Age in 1949 with director Sang Hu. Sound effects, mainly non-diegetic ones, are another dimension that has enhanced the film's comicality. On several occasions, the use of sound accompanies Sizhen's laughter-arousing white lies to intensify the comic result or increase the contrast. In the forementioned lie with the bowl, every time Sizhen tries to remove the broken piece, there is background music coinciding with the visual image. Sizhen's second lie about Zhiyuan's means of travel comes with the same uplifting and cheerful tune when Zhiyuan boards and disembarks the plane. Similar to Sizhen's lies, Shi Mimi's purposely leaving a handkerchief with her lips mark in Zhiyuan's suit pocket is carried out with funny melody. Later when Sizhen accidentally pulls it out, the same music appears but only to lead to the irony that Sizhen even decides to cover up Zhiyuan's affair in front of the maid.Pei-yin, Lin. \\"Comicality in Long Live the Mistress and the Making of a Chinese Comedy of Manners.\\" Tamkang Review, vol. 47, no. 1, 2016, p. 97+.

Casting The leading cast members including Shangguan Yunzhu, Jiang Tianliu, Zhang Fa and Shi Hui, all of whom had originally performed in stage drama during the war under Japanese rule, put in passionate performances throughout the film.Edited by Henriot, Christian and Yeh, Wen-hsin (2012). ‚ÄúVisualising China, 1845-1965: Moving and Still Images in Historical Narratives‚Äù Asian Cinema, pp. 466. The film was initially planned to let Wang Danfeng play the supporting actress. However, she failed to participate in the filming, and the character was changed to perform by Shangguan Yunzhu. Budget Long Live the Missus! is a well-made small-budget film. Despite the often awkward camera movements (perhaps a result of the limited budgetary support), the characterization and plot are enlivened by the witty, incisive dialogues that are a distinct hallmark of Chang's wartime fiction.Edited by Henriot, Christian and Yeh, Wen-hsin (2012). ‚ÄúVisualising China, 1845-1965: Moving and Still Images in Historical Narratives‚Äù Asian Cinema, pp. 466.  Themes  Marriage & Family Long Live the Missus! tells the story of a middle-class family. Through the repressed state of women under the traditional patriarchal culture, it shows \\"the value crisis encountered by traditional morality, family, ethical structure and gender relations at the turn of the new era\\".Ji Hua- yue(2018).\\"ÁîµÂΩ±Á±ªÂûã„ÄÅÊÄßÂà´ËßÜËßí‰∏éÂΩ¢Ë±°ÊûÑÂª∫Ôºö‰∏≠ÂõΩÊó©ÊúüÂñúÂâßÁîµÂΩ±‰∏≠ÁöÑÂ•≥ÊÄßÂΩ¢Ë±°Ôºà1949Âπ¥‰ª•ÂâçÔºâ\\" [D].‰∏≠ÂõΩËâ∫ÊúØÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢, P44-45. It centers on women dealing with pressure and expectation to conform to family roles as a dutiful daughter-in-law, childbearing, and a good wife. Traditionally, it was common for several generations to live under one roof together and usually the wife moved in with her husband‚Äôs family which is the case in this film. The mother runs the household and treats the daughter-in- law in a grating manner which is made clear when Sizhen is seen constantly waiting on her mother-in-law‚Äôs hand and foot.Chu, S.S.(1974). Some Aspects of Extended Kinship in a Chinese Community. The Journal of Marriage and Family, 36(3), pg. 628 Missus is an English translation of the Mandarin word tai tai, meaning ‚Äúwife‚Äù or a wealthy married woman who does not work. In particular, tai tai in the context of the film refers to the socialized aspects of a wife in the domestic context and the somewhat scheming nature of the women. While the film conveys the difficulties to become a good \\"taitai,\\" another theme or moral of the film might suggest that men are unreliable. This is demonstrated when both Old Mr. Chen, Sizhen‚Äôs father, and Zhiyuan engage in affairs. Even though Old Mr. Chen was supposed to confront Zhiyuan for betraying his daughter, he too gets sucked in by the wily charms of a young woman, and teaches Zhiyuan how to lie to Sizhen in order to calm her down. The obvious family conflict focuses on Zhiyuan‚Äôs affair. Zhiyuan is repeatedly portrayed near a mirror, creating a doubling effect. The doubling of Zhiyuan in the mirror symbolizes the two-faced quality of his character based on how he acts as a husband towards his wife and behind her back. This comedy of errors exposes the moneyed culture and the hypocrisy of Shanghai urbanities, and ridicules bourgeois materialism and decadence through its portrayal of negative male figures.Ng, K. (2008). The Screenwriter as Cultural Broker: Travels of Zhang Ailing's Comedy of Love. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, 20(2), 131-184. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/41482536 In addition, the Chinese Civil Code from the 1930s gave individuals, including women a great deal of freeness to decide and manage their personal events, including freedom of marriage. According to the Civil Code, whether two people were getting married or divorced, they needed to sign the legal documents in front of two witnesses or a lawyer. This is the first time in Chinese history that women have been granted the right to divorce, it gave Chinese women a chance to leave their miserable marriage legally and freely. In the movie, like many women at the time, Sizhen was ready to save herself from suffering and apply her right to a divorce.Alison W. ConnerÔºà2011Ôºâ. ‚ÄúMovie Justice: The Legal System in Pre-1949 Chinese Film‚Äù Asian-Pacific Law & Policy Journal [Vol. 12:1], University of Hawaii, University of Hawai'i Press, November 2011,p1-40. Deception The film also follows a theme of deception. It lampoons the deception and folly of urban, middle-class life. Through its dramatic plot twists and concocted dialogues, characters engage in theatrical gestures, role-playing, and lying, thus highlighting the essentially deceptive nature of human relations.Ng, K. (2008). The Screenwriter as Cultural Broker: Travels of Zhang Ailing's Comedy of Love. Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, 20(2), 131-184. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/41482536 For example, from the beginning, when Maid Zhang breaks the bowl, Sizhen tries to cover it up and hide it from her mother-in-law. She is seen lying to her mother-in-law again telling her that Zhiyuan plans to take a trip to Hong Kong by boat, because it is safer, instead of by plane. Sizhen also lies to her father about Zhiyuan's mother's wealth, which misleads her father to help Zhiyuan's business, and eventually leads to the tragedy of her marriage. Even at the end of the film, she lies to Zhiqin and Sirui about coming to the lawyer's firm for celebration, not for her divorce with Zhiyuan. However, despite her attempts to conceal information, she is usually found out. Therefore, linking the theme of deception with exposure. Deception is also seen when Sizhen's little brother lies about where he bought the pineapples, when Shi Mimi lies about how she \\"has never told anyone this personal information before\\", and of course, when Zhiyuan lying about his affair with Shi Mimi. In all of these instances, the truths being covered up are inevitably revealed and the characters must face the consequences.  Chinese Comedy of Manners  Despite its Western origin, comedy of manners was appropriated by Eileen Chang for her own aesthetics. What has made Chang's opinion on comedy here remarkable is not so much her acknowledgement of laughing as natural but her insight into the coexistence of tragic and comic constituents. Comedy provides an effective channel to express the double aspect‚Äîbodily instinct and rational intellect‚Äîof human lives. This dualistic view on human's living condition is manifested in Chang's opinion on Chen Sizhen. Chang asserted: \\"Eventually she has a happy ending, but she is still not particularly happy. The so-called \\"bittersweet middle age\\" probably implies that there is always some sadness mingled in their [middle-aged people] happiness. Their sadness however is not completely without comfort. I very much like these few characters' \\"fushi de beiai\\" (sadness of the floating life). But it were \\"fushi de beihuan\\" (sadness and happiness of the floating life), then it would in fact be more pitiful than \\"sadness of the floating life,\\" as it contains a feeling of vast vicissitudes.\\" \\"Taitai wansui tiji\\" (Preface to Long Live the Mistress), Zhangkan (Zhang Ailing's outlook). Beijing: Economy Daily Press, 2002, 378. Print. There are similarities between Long Live the Missus! and the Hollywood screwball comedies, such as the focus on the love conflict/battling process of a (mismatched) couple, juxtaposition (of all male and female, capable and incapable), coincidences and chance encounters in the plot. Long Live the Mistress accounts an ordinary housewife's life. It is set in the most common locale-Shanghai's nongtang where Zhang claimed \\"there can be several Chen Sizhen in just one house.\\" In contrast, most of the screwball comedies were played out against settings of sheer affluence (a Connecticut estate or a Park Avenue penthouse), properties (elegant clothes, cars, and furniture), and lines (witty and inventive repartee).Pei-yin, Lin. \\"Comicality in Long Live the Mistress and the Making of a Chinese Comedy of Manners.\\" Tamkang Review, vol. 47, no. 1, 2016, p. 97+.

Critical reception  Long Live The Missus! was widely assailed by the press and has been praised by critics across Taiwan Straits as an ‚Äòabsolutely underestimated masterpiece in the history of Chinese cinema‚Äô and considered ‚Äòthe best Chinese comedy ever made.‚ÄôLong Live The Missus! was positively received partially due to the fact that it had catered to the Shanghai audience's appetite for family melodrama and films that dealt with women in familial and social situations.Ng, K.

Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/41482536 Long Live the Missus! has been described as a generally apolitical film in terms of theme and tone, and it is true that issues of rich and poor do not surface in its story. However, many of Eileen Chang‚Äôs work contains themes of seduction and betrayal and this film is not without its ‚Äòpolitical‚Äô points relating to women. In addition to the portrayal of ordinary Shanghai women in a time of economic crisis and cultural conflicts, this film brings awareness to gender relationships, middle-class family life, and the complex politics of Chinese cinema in post-war China.Conner, Alison W (2007). \\"Chinese Lawyers on the Silver Screen.

(\\"Beijing Daoxiang\\") v. Beijing Sudao Food Industry Co., Ltd., and Suzhou Daoxiang Village Food Co., Ltd., (both together \\"Suzhou Daoxiang\\") (2015) Jing Zhimin Chu Zi No. 1606 is a trademark litigation case in China involving the name of a very popular brand of moon cake and highlights the criteria applied by Chinese courts to interim injunctions. The Beijing Intellectual Property Court ordered an injunction near the time of China's Mid-Autumn Festival which is the only time of the year in which mooncakes are sold. Background The two parties are pastry companies based in different parts of China. Suzhou Daoxiang is based in Jiangsu and has been operating since 1773. Beijing Daoxiang is based in Beijing and has been operating since 1895. Both companies have long produced moon cakes branded as Daoxiangcun (Á®ªÈ¶ôÊùë, ‚Äúvillage with fragrant rice paddies‚Äù) and both have registered the term as a trademark, in different product categories - Suzhou Daoxiang in 1982 and Beijing Daixiang in 1997. Because of increased use of e-commerce, the two companies have come into increasingly direct competition with one another. In 2006, Suzhou Daoxiang applied to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) to register a trademark including the phrase Daoxiangcun. Beijing Daoxiang objected and their position was upheld by the SAIC's review board in 2013 and by the Beijing High Court in 2014. Suzhou Daoxiang continued to use the trademark, so Beijing Daoxiang filed a case in the Beijing Intellectual Property Court. Preliminary Injunction On 22 September 2017, a judicial panel consisting of Zhang Xiaojin, Cui Ning and Liu Yijun granted an interim injunction because the applicant was urgently facing irreparable damage.https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3OTA3MjQ3Mw‚à£=2650267461&idx;=2&sn;=d0d4de35ef49f2facee57d6c6c5979a8 The court stated that: > ...[I]f the relevant behavioral preservation measures are not taken, it will > cause irreparable damage to the lawful rights and interests of the > applicants, that is, the judgment of the irreparable damage and the urgency > of the behavior preservation measures. In view of the current Mid-Autumn > Festival and National Day holiday, traditional cakes and other commodities > are in the peak season of sales, the sales volume of the infringed goods > such as moon cakes and other cakes will increase significantly, and the > market share of the applicants will be quickly seized, thus greatly reducing > their interests. Therefore, if the respondent is not ordered to immediately > stop the case, it will have a serious impact on the applicant's market share > and will cause irreparable damage to its interests. The damage will be > greater than the respondent's Beijing Sudao Company and Suzhou. Daoxiangcun > Company stopped the damage caused by the act of the case. On 26 September 2017, in response to the preliminary injunction, the defendant placed a counter-guarantee of RMB 60 million in cash, which was twice as much as the guarantee placed by the plaintiff and requested the court to lift the injunction. Due to the counter-guarantee, the short shelf-life of mooncakes, the short season in which mooncakes can be sold, the likelihood that the defendant would suffer huge losses if the mooncakes that had already been produced were not permitted for sale, and that the applicant could be compensated by money since the counter-guarantee placed by the defendant was sufficient to cover all of the applicant's claims, the court lifted the injunction. Outcome Suzhou Daoxiang was ordered to stop using the trademarks and to pay RMB 30 million in damages to Beijing Daoxiang.

It was first described based on a very large series of fossils from the site of Aramis in the Middle Awash, which has been dated by 40Ar/39Ar to 4.4 million years old. It has since been found from similarly aged sediments at Gona, approximately 75 km to the North. Additional fossils from the Middle Awash extend its known time range back to at least 5.3 million years ago. There is only one known species, Pliopapio alemui.  Description  In most ways, Pliopapio is similar other generalized members of the tribe Papionini, such as the living macaques, mangabeys, and baboons. In overall size, P. alemui was close to the larger macaques and smaller baboons. Based on dental measurements, females are estimated to have averaged 8.5 Kg in body weight and males approximately 12 Kg. This suggests only a modest level of sexual dimorphism in body size. Pliopapio possessed a relatively elongate and narrow muzzle and a brain case that lacked superstructures such as sagittal or nuchal crests. Dentally, it is similar to most papionin monkeys, but the molar teeth are somewhat narrower and taller. A few limb fragments have been tentatively allocated to P. alemui. They suggest it was a semi-terrestrial quadrupedal monkey that was more adapted to arboreal locomotion than baboons, but less than crested mangabeys.  Diet  The dentition suggests it had an opportunistic and omnivorous diet similar to many living papionin monkeys. Analysis of the chewing surfaces of the molar teeth found microwear consistent with a diet of fruits and or leaves, and of softer food items in particular. Carbon isotopes from tooth enamel reflect incorporation of more savanna-based foods (i.e. C4/CAM ) than Kuseracolobus aramisi a colobine monkey, but fewer than the human ancestor Ardipithecus ramidus at Aramis. Carbon isotopic analysis of P. alemui tooth enamel from Gona showed similar results. From Aramis, analysis of oxygen isotopes may suggest more fruit than leaves, whereas at Gona, enamel oxygen isotopes suggest more access to open water.

Former students of the school have reported experiencing physical, psychological, and sexual abuse while attending the school.  History  The school opened in 1906 under the direction of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate and the Grey Nuns of the Cross (also known as the Sisters of Charity) with the financial and administrative support of the federal government. Originally located at the Fort Albany Mission on Albany Island, Ontario, in the James Bay Treaty region (Treaty 9), the school relocated to the north shore of the banks of Albany River in 1932. The school burned down in 1939 and was subsequently rebuilt. Students who attended the school were from surrounding First Nations communities including: Fort Albany, Attawapiskat First Nation, Weenusk First Nation, Constance Lake First Nation, Moose Fort and Fort Severn First Nation. In 2015, the rectory of the school was burnt to the ground.  Abuse and lawsuit  Many former students of St. Anne's describe experiencing physical, psychological and sexual abuse while at the school. Physical abuse came in many different forms including: poor living conditions, and corporal punishments for speaking your traditional language. St. Anne's survivor Edmund Metatawabin documented the school's use of an electric chair \\"for punishment and sport\\" in the book Up Ghost River. The electric chair was used between the mid-1950s and mid-1960s according to documented police testimony.The horrors of St. Anne's 2018 https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform/st-anne- residential-school-opp-documents Psychological abuse began with the act of taking the students who were small children away from their families. This abuse allegedly continued within the school. Many residential school survivors also were the victims of sexual abuse in various forms. Many have come forward stating they were sexually assaulted while attending the school. An Ontario Provincial Police(OPP) investigation, conducted between 1992 and 1998, interviewed 700 victims and witnesses about physical assaults, sexual assaults, suspicious deaths and other abuses alleged to have occurred at the school between 1941 and 1972.

It belongs to the family Gastrocotylidae. Systematics Pseudaxine bivaginalis was described based on 15 specimens, from the gills of the yellowtail horse mackerel Trachurus novaezelandiae (Carangidae), collected off New Zealand. In the same paper, Dillon & Hargis emended the diagnosis of the genus Pseudaxine, to include the presence of (1) a paired vaginae opening near the lateral margins at or near the level of the genital atrium, (2) a genito-intestinal canal short and postovarian or relatively long and paraovarian. Description Pseudaxine bivaginalis has the general morphology of all species of Pseudaxine, with an elongate body and an anterior extremity constricted at the level of buccal suckers in most specimens, comprising an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is asymmetrical, with a laterally directed end (the direction in which the end points, right or left, varies individually, but the internal organs appear to maintain a constant orientation regardless of this variation), and bears 23-34 clamps similar in shape but slightly dissimilar in size, arranged in a single row. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. The extreme of the haptor carries an elongated proboscis-like process called \\"the terminal lappet\\", bearing 2 pairs of gastrocotyloid anchors. There are also two buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior subterminal mouth, a pharynx, an oesophagus and a posterior intestine that bifurcates near the level of the genital atrium in two lateral branches. The intestinal branches are ramified medially and laterally and are not confluent posteriorly. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium, armed with 12-14 hooks, a paired vaginae ventrolateral, near the genital atrium, a foldedovary and 12-18 testespost-ovarian, located between the intestinal branches and extend posteriorly to the anterior part of the haptor. Eggs are fusiform, with filaments at both ends. Etymology The species name refers to New Zealand, the type-locality of the species. Hosts and localities the yellowtail horse mackerel Trachurus novaezelandiae is the type host of Pseudaxine bivaginalis The type-host and only recorded host is the yellowtail horse mackerel Trachurus novaezelandiae (Carangidae).

After finishing elementary school, on the advice of a teacher, his father enrolled him at a gymnasium in Chernivtsi. There, he showed an aptitude for drawing. This led to lessons at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna. For his senior \\"thesis\\" painting, he presented a copy of The Three Graces by Rubens, that was judged to be equal in technique to the original.Brief Biography @ GOFF.net.ua (archived) In 1874, he returned to Chernivtsi and became a drawing teacher at the German-language Realschule. He remained there until his retirement in 1906. Many of the students later recalled that he often broke the rules and spoke to them in Ukrainian. His wages were insufficient to support a large family, so he devoted much of his personal time to painting portraits. Most of them involved wealthy foreigners, but he also took time to paint well-known Ukrainian figures. He also participated in public and social activities. Together with his brother, , a noted writer, he was a long time member of the , an educational-cultural society. For a time, he served as its Treasurer. He also sang in the local Ukrainian choir. Later, he became a member of the . In 1918, he supported the movement to unite Northern Bukovina with the West Ukrainian People's Republic, rather than have it become part of Romania. The subsequent occupation by Romania, and the persecution of his friends and family, caused his already frail health to deteriorate and he died in 1919. His works have not fared well. In 1913, those he sent to the All-Ukrainian Art Exhibition in Kiev disappeared in transit.

The 34th North Carolina Infantry spent the winter of 1861/62 drilling at High Point and Raleigh. Many men suffered the childhood diseases they had been spared as youths. Come spring, the regiment was transferred to Fort Branch, near Hamilton, on duty against Union gunboats on the Roanoke River.Latimore 1901, pp. 582. Cole & Foley 2007, p. 64. Hess 2002, p. 43. At the beginning of the summer of 1862, it was transferred to Pender's Brigade, A. P. Hill's Light Division, Army of Northern Virginia. Crenshaw 2017, p. 163. The regiment was soon engaged in the Seven Days Battles, fighting in the battles of Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, and Frayser's Farm. Although not directly engaged at Malvern Hill, it came under heavy artillery fire for several hours.Latimore 1901, pp. 582-584. In August 1862, the Light Division was transferred to Stonewall Jackson's command; the 34th North Carolina participating in the battles of Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas, Ox Hill, Harpers Ferry. After the last battle, the regiment was in charge of the pontoon bridge, and participated in the paroling of the large number of prisoners of war. After a speedy march, it reached Sharpsburg, Maryland in time to participate in the battle. During the withdrawal to Virginia, the regiment participated in the defeat of the pursuing Union army at the battle of Shepherdstown. After Shepherdstown, the 34th North Carolina could enjoy quite a long period of rest, until engaged at the battle of Fredericksburg in the middle of December.Latimore 1901, pp. 584-586. Pickett's charge. The winter of 1862/63 was spent in winter quarters at Moss Neck. The winter was severe, the supply faltering, the provisions low, yet the morale of the regiment remained high. During the battle of Chancellorsville, it participated in the flanking movement of Stonewall Jackson's command. The regiment then returned to Moss Neck, where it remained until the army in early June broke camp for the Gettysburg campaign. At the battle of Gettysburg, the 34th Regiment suffered heavily, both during the first and during the third day.Latimore 1901, pp. 586-587. The total loss of the 34th North Carolina Infantry at Gettysburg was 104 of its 311 men.Reardon & Vossler 2013. p. 149.

During the retreat to Virginia, the regiment fought at the battle of Falling Waters; many men were captured by the pontoon bridge.Latimore 1901, p. 587. The 34th North Carolina was present at the battle of Bristoe Station, but it was not actively engaged. It fought at the battle of Mine Run, enduring the cold weather with great pain. The regiment spent the winter of 1863/64 at Orange Court House, where they received new recruits. They were mostly between 40 and 45 years of age, and not very able or willing soldiers. Soldiers kept deserting, no doubt because of the lack of supplies.Gallagher 1997, p. 43. Come spring, and the campaign season, the regiment fought at the battles of the Wilderness; Spotsylvania Court House, where its losses were few, fighting as they did behind breastworks; Hanover Junction, where it suffered heavy casualties, losing three color bearers. At the battle of Cold Harbor it was not actively engaged, but came under rapid Union fire for a long time. During the siege of Petersburg, the 34th North Carolina fought at the battle of Jerusalem Plank Road, later participating in the first assault wave at Ream's Station, being repulsed with heavy casualties.Latimore 1901, pp. 587-588.

A last desperate fight was fought at Sutherland's Station, inflicting severe losses on the Union attackers.

The album was released on June 9, 2017 by Mot√©ma. Background Hudson is the name of the quartet; it is inspired by the beauty and history of the Hudson River from which Woodstock is a few miles away. Bassist Larry Grenadier is himself a resident of the Hudson Valley. What is more, DeJohnette appeared on 1996 Michael Brecker's album Tales from the Hudson, which had similar instrumentation‚Äîexcept for Brecker's saxophone. The quartet initially played a concert together at the 2014 Woodstock Jazz Festival; that experience encouraged the band to pursue the project, culminating in the present record. Hudson is the band's debut, eponymous album consisting of not only originals by bandmembers but also new renditions of famous songs by such musicians as Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, The Band, and Jimi Hendrix. Another relevant touchstone, unstated but clearly implied, is Miles Davis. The album also includes a new version of song \\"Dirty Ground\\", a 2011 tune from DeJohnette's album Sound Travels recorded with lyrics and vocals by Bruce Hornsby. The album clearly celebrates the music from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Hudson was recorded directly to Pro Tools at 24-bit/96kHz at Scott Petito's NRS Recording Studio, in Catskill, New York. Petito has been DeJohnette's recording engineer for some 20 years. The label's official website also states that the release celebrates Jack DeJonnette's 75th birthday. Reception Paul de Barros of DownBeat wrote, \\"It would be easy to dismiss the supergroup Hudson as mere boomer nostalgia, but that would overlook just how vigorous, original, engaged and downright pleasurable this welcome debut sounds.... The band jumps deep into free territory on the title- track opener, an archeo-futuristic jam that spins raunchy, fuzzed guitar and skronky keyboard clanks around a throbbing, ceremonial beat\\". Seth Colter Walls of Pitchfork Media stated, \\"This is not the most fiery music DeJohnette has collaborated on, in his eighth decade. But the peaceable mastery that moves through Hudson does have the distinction of feeling comfortable without being too predictable\\". John Fordham in his review for The Guardian added, \\"The group's slightly clunky Native American chanting might have been better replaced by sampled field-recordings with instrumental decoration, but this is an elite jazz outfit collectively telling a compelling new story\\". Nate Chinen of JazzTimes commented \\"What they're creating is a top-to-bottom group improvisation‚Äîa jam, if we're being plainspoken about it‚Äîwith the morphing shape of an amoeba. But over the course of a discursive and open-ended 23 minutes, a kind of structural integrity emerges, rooted in the loopy clarity of DeJohnette's groove\\". Writing for Elmore, Jim Hynes stated, \\"The album is a showcase for all four of them... Given the mostly electric fare, particularly on the rock numbers, it‚Äôs tempting to call this jazz fusion but it feels different. It‚Äôs lighter.\\" Track listing Personnel *John Medeski ‚Äì piano, electric piano, organ, flute, vocals *John Scofield ‚Äì guitar, flute *Larry Grenadier ‚Äì double bass, vocals *Jack DeJohnette ‚Äì drums, flute, vocals  References  Category:2017 albums Category:Jack DeJohnette albums Category:John Medeski albums Category:John Scofield albums Category:Larry Grenadier albums Category:Mot√©ma Music albums ","title":"Hudson (album)"},{"id":"60152902","text":"North Korea‚ÄìVenezuela relations are relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Venezuela is one of the five countries in Latin America that has an embassy of North Korea along with Peru, Cuba, Brazil and Mexico. However, Venezuela is one of the only countries in the world that has a good relationship with both North and South Korea. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1965 and Venezuela recognized North Korea as a sovereign state in 1974. Relations have gradually improved under the governments of Hugo Ch√°vez and Nicol√°s Maduro. The two countries are both critical of the United States.  History  Prior to 1974, Venezuela had recognized the South Korean government as the sole representative of the Korean peninsula. In the 1990s, due to the severe financial crisis and the small budget of North Korea, the government was forced to close 30% of its embassies worldwide, including the North Korea embassy in Venezuela. In September 2007, lawmaker Yang Hyong-sop visited Venezuela and said the two countries needed to respond jointly to \\"American pressure and threats.\\" In July 2008, president Hugo Ch√°vez considered plans to meet North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang, but no date was set. In September 2013, President Maduro declared three US diplomats persona non grata for alleged conspiracy to overthrow him, a decision that received clear support from Kim's regime. North Korean ambassador to Venezuela Jon Yong Jin congratulated President of Venezuela to take that action and rejected the \\"interventionist policy directed by the United States through their embassies,\\" warning that if the US government dared to engage in a military attack on Venezuela, North Korea would assist Venezuela. Both parties then decided to create the Friendship Group of Venezuela with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. In October 2013, North Korea's ambassador, Jon Yong Jin, who represents North Korea as a non-resident ambassador to several countries, visited Venezuela. During his visit, Yong Jin met with deputies to the National Assembly Yul Jabour and Julio Ch√°vez of the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) respectively. Ambassador Yong Jin also took the opportunity to express his support for President Nicol√°s Maduro when he attended the headquarters of the Permanent Commission on Foreign Policy, Sovereignty and Integration in Caracas. On 20 June 2014, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry requested that North Korea reopen its embassy in the country. The North Korean embassy was re- opened a year later at La Mercedes, Caracas, as solidarity between the two countries has strengthened. The two countries also signed a bilateral agreement to build a giant statue.  Recent developments  On 30 November 2018, the President of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam, visited Venezuela to meet with President Nicol√°s Maduro as part of Yong-nam's tour of Latin American countries of Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. Korean Workers' Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that Kim Yong-nam met with Maduro at the Miraflores Palace and signed agreements. During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, North Korea was among the 22 countries recognizing Nicol√°s Maduro as the President of Venezuela. The North Korean government confirmed Ri Song-gil, the North Korean ambassador to Venezuela, met with Laura Suarez, a Venezuelan diplomat in charge of Asia, Middle East and Oceanian Affairs, according to South Korean news service Newsis. Ambassador Ri expressed that North Korea will continue to \\"strengthen solidarity and cooperation with socialist countries in accordance with the ideology of self- reliance, peace and good will\\" and to \\"develop relations with all nations that exhibit friendship.\\" Diplomatic missions * Venezuela has an embassy in Pyongyang, in operation since 2019.

Career  alt= Clement began working for the Chicago Police Department in 1909, patrolling department stores in search of pickpockets. In 1913, she became a detective, and soon after she was talked about in several newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Variety. On May 21, 1922 she appeared in the New York Evening Telegram. In 1919, Clement wrote, produced, and starred in a movie called \\"Dregs of the City,\\" where she played as herself.

Hammarskold, was a member of the prominent Hammarskj√∂ld family, who in 1850 followed his father to the United States. He became an ironmaster and U.S. Postmaster in North Carolina. When the American Civil War began, he was commissioned in the Confederate States Army, resigning as lieutenant colonel after the Seven Days Battles. Hammarsk√∂ld returned to his old homeland in 1863, where he made a successful, albeit short, career as a railwayman, dying at the age of 50. North Carolina Carl Jacob Hammarsk√∂ld passed the studentexamen at Uppsala University in 1849, the same year his father Carl Wilhelm Carl Jacob Hammarsk√∂ld departed in all haste to the United States. The father had been manager and part owner of Skultuna m√§ssingsbruk, but had overextended his liquidity in commodities speculations. Facing insolvency, he eluded his creditors by leaving with a large sum of money for South Carolina, where he had a cousin. There he became manager of the Coopersville Iron Works. A year later, Carl Jacob together with his mother, sister, and his mother's female companion, travelled from Stockholm to Savannah, Georgia in order to reunite with the father.Lindahl 1904, p. 293.Olsson 1958, p. 64.Ulfs√§ter-Troell 1991, pp. 54‚Äì55, 58.Olsson & Wik√©n 1995, pp. 457‚Äì459. By now, the Coopersville Ironworks had been taken over by a new company with Hammarsk√∂ld senior as president. Skilled workers had been recruited in Sweden, and travelled over the Atlantic with the same ship as Carl Jacob. They all journeyed together, but after the arrival at Coopersville, the workers refused to accept the terms of employment and dispersed to other places in seek of a better future. This created a rupture between the president and the company, and the Hammarsk√∂ld family had to leave Coopersville, and move to North Carolina.Ulfs√§ter-Troell 1991, pp. 68‚Äì69.Eelman 2008, p. 41.Hammarskj√∂ld 1915, p. 528. In North Carolina, the elder Hammarsk√∂ld bought the Spring Hill Forge in Lincoln County. It was an ironworks of the bloomery type, built at the beginning of the 19th century, and rebuilt after the purchase. It had three fires and two hammers, and made about 100 tons of bar iron per year. Carl Jacob Hammarsk√∂ld began his American life as a common workman at his father's forge, but soon advanced to company clerk and in 1853 to manager and part owner. He also ran a general store in Morgantown, and was U.S. Postmaster from 1857. He briefly visited Sweden in 1860, when he accompanied his sister who was sent to a music conservatory in the old homeland.Register 1857, p. 167.Lesley 1866, p. 188.Graham 1904, p. 142.Hammarskj√∂ld 1915, p. 531.Elgenstierna 1925‚Äì1936, vol. 3, pp. 478‚Äì479.Ulfs√§ter-Troell 1991, p. 107.Harpe 2000, p. 36.Carpenter 2016, p. 41.\\"NC Post Offices ‚Äì 1785 to 1882.\\" Carolana.

American Civil War By now, \\"Hammarsk√∂ld had, with all his soul, become a Southerner.\\" On May 10, 1861, Carl Jacob writes to Sweden from Raleigh, that he had left all that was dear to him, to participate in a war that will determine the destiny of the \\"glorious South,\\" fully convinced that either win or die in the defense of \\"our country.\\" Two weeks ago, he continues, he was ordered by Governor Ellis to report for active duty. Although it was difficult to leave his mother and his home, he took the first train to Raleigh. There he and three others were running the governor's military office; drilling, mustering, and parading the troops. Hammarsk√∂ld blamed the war on President Lincoln; \\"the wretched president\\". Hammarsk√∂ld was commissioned second lieutenant, August 31, 1861.Roster 1905, p. 33. When the 34th North Carolina Infantry was organized in October 1861, he was commissioned as first lieutenant in Company E. When the regiment was reorganized in the spring of 1862, he became a major April 2, 1862, and was within a couple of weeks promoted to lieutenant colonel.H√§ggman & Gjertveit 2001, pp. 151.

The regiment was soon engaged in the Seven Days Battles, fighting in the battles of Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill, and Frayser's Farm.Latimore 1901, pp. 582‚Äì584. Hammarsk√∂ld left the Confederate army after the Seven Days Battles. His business and his mother's and sister's concern made it necessary for him to go home to North Carolina, and an eye disease gave him reason to tender his resignation. He wrote to a relative in Sweden, explaining his decision, saying that he happened to come to a regiment where he had but few acquaintances, yet rose to become lieutenant colonel, and commanding four regiments as the generals and colonels became casualties. He did enjoy the military service, although being without dry clothes, or mess gear, for weeks on, or being in the middle of a battle with bullets flying and people falling every minute, was not a pleasure. However, military life had something that revived the soul, he insisted; \\"the concept of honor or death is satisfying.\\"Hammarsk√∂ld 1915, pp. 531‚Äì532.  Railwayman in Sweden  After his resignation from the Confederate Army, Hammarskold made a living as a merchant. However, in 1863, he decided to return to Sweden with his mother and sister. The family traveled through the war torn country to New York, where the Swedish minister, Carl Piper, helped them to get passage over the Atlantic. Back in his homeland, Hammarsk√∂ld was employed by the Swedish State Railways as an accountant in 1863. Within the year, he was promoted to stationmaster, and in 1866 to assistant district traffic manager. Nine years later, he became traffic manager of the Stockholm district. His mother and sister settled in Uppsala, where his sister for a while taught classes in English, before she died from an internal disease. His mother became a housekeeper to the old Archbishop Henrik Reuterdahl; when he died, she moved in with her son, who just had married.

It sets the beginning of Psalm XLI (42) in the Latin version of the Psalterium Romanum rather than the Vulgate Bible. The incipit is \\"Sicut cervus desiderat ad fontes\\" (As the deer desires the fountains) followed by a second part (secunda pars) \\"Sitivit anima mea\\" (My soul thirsts). It was published in 1604 in Motecta festorum, Liber 2, and has become one of Palestrina's most popular motets, regarded as a model of Renaissance polyphony, expressing spiritual yearning.  History  The motet is a setting of Psalm 42:2,3. The Psalm was a prescribed tract for the blessing of the water (font) on Holy Saturday, recalling the water of baptism as well as the \\"living water of the eucharist\\". The text, speaking of the longing for God, retained its association with funeral music, having been widely used as the Tract before the Tridentine Roman Missal of 1570 standardized the tract Absolve, Domine.Absolve appears in one of the first printed missals, p. 485. Sicut survived in the Sarum Rite , p 864* and had been used on the continent, memorably in Ockeghem's setting of the Requiem. Palestrina's setting was posthumously published in Venice in 1604 in the collection Motectorum quatuor vocibus, ... liber secundus, a sequel to the 1564 Motecta festorum. It is now one of Palestrina's most anthologized works and regarded as a model of Renaissance polyphony.  Music  The motet is written for four voices, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. It is set in imitative polyphony throughout, with attention to the meaning of the text in subtle word-painting. For the word \\"desiderat\\", expressing longing, the pace is faster, and the melody rises, reaching its peak on the word \\"fontes\\" (streams, water, fountains). In the continuation of the first part, \\"ita desiderat anima mea ad te, Deus (Thus longs my soul for Thee, God), the human desire expressed in the first person is rendered in denser imitation and with more intense dissonance. The motet has been described as the expression of \\"serene but fervent spiritual yearning\\".

In early March 2019, it was reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he had been captured and imprisoned by Kurdish forces. Taylor has since sought to return to New Zealand, triggering considerable media coverage and political commentary. Background Mark Taylor grew up in Hamilton in the North Island. According to a relative, he suffered brain damage following a \\"major fit with teething.\\" He attended a special needs school but was brought up as a normal child. During the 1990s, Taylor served in the New Zealand Army. He married a Christian woman and became a \\"born again\\" Christian. In 2009, Taylor traveled to Yemen and Pakistan, drawing the attention of New Zealand authorities. Following his arrest by Pakistani authorities while trying to reach an Al Qaeda and Taliban stronghold on the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan border, the New Zealand Government imposed travel restrictions on him. According to a Muslim elder from the Hamilton Muslim community, Taylor struggled with mental health issues and was influenced by the sermons of radical Yemeni-American preacher Anwar Al-Awlaki. In 2010, Taylor was deported from Australia after his visa was cancelled when he was classified as a \\"security risk\\" by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Taylor had lived between Australia and New Zealand for 25 years. In 2011, Taylor was reissued with a New Zealand passport. In May 2012, he migrated to Indonesia where he worked as an English- language teacher for two years. During his time in Indonesia, Taylor reportedly married an Indonesian woman and had children with her. She reportedly expressed unease about his unstable character and addiction to violent video games. Joining ISIL In June 2014, Taylor entered Syria through the Turkish border and joined the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In late 2014, Taylor deleted 45 Twitter posts after they reportedly exposed an ISIL presence in the Kafar Roma area in Syria. In late April 2015, Taylor appeared in an ISIS YouTube propaganda video calling for terror attacks in New Zealand and Australia on Anzac Day, which falls on 25 April. In response, the United States Government designated Taylor as a \\"Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\\" Taylor has claimed that he was not a fighter during the five years that he spent with ISIL and that he only served as a border guard along the border between the Islamic State and Syria. Taylor has also alleged that he was imprisoned three times by the ISIL secret police unit. In October 2015, Taylor mistakenly exposed the location of ISIL fighters on Twitter when he forgot to turn off a tracking function on his phone, earning the nickname the \\"bumbling Jihadist\\". He claims that he was imprisoned for 50 days as punishment for that incident. Taylor has also claimed that he witnessed several beheadings and executions during his time with ISIL. In May 2017, Taylor surfaced on the Islamic marriage website \\"islamicmarriage.com\\" seeking a wife willing to join him in the Islamic State's capital of Raqqa. During his time in Syria, Taylor was reportedly married to two women. His first wife was a Syrian woman from Deir ez-Zor named Umm Mohammed who wanted him to leave for Turkey. Taylor subsequently married a younger woman who was sympathetic to ISIL. However, Taylor divorced her after she wanted to move to another area in order to be closer to her family. Capture and intended return In December 2018, Taylor fled ISIL forces and surrendered to Kurdish forces in Syria. Taylor claims that he was motivated by the lack of food and money. On 4 March 2019, Taylor was interviewed while in custody by Australian Broadcasting Corporation Middle East correspondent Adam Harvey and Suzanne Dredge. During the interview, Taylor claimed that he had not taken part in hostilities but had merely served as a border guard for ISIL. Taylor also claimed to have witnessed several beheadings and executions. In addition, Taylor expressed regret that he was too poor to buy a female Yazidi slave. Taylor has expressed a desire to return to New Zealand but has acknowledged that he would not be surprised if his country did not take him back. During an interview with journalist Campell MacDiarmid of the Abu Dhabi-based newspaper The National, Taylor claimed that he had been in contact with New Zealand intelligence officers who had encouraged him to leave ISIS and had offered him assistance to return home. Taylor has also expressed an interest in setting up a medical marijuana company after returning to New Zealand. However, Andrew Little, the Minister in charge of New Zealand's intelligence services, has asserted that no New Zealand government representatives have been in contact with Taylor since his capture. Political responses In response to media coverage of Taylor's capture, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of the Labour Party has confirmed that New Zealand would not be stripping Taylor of his citizenship but that he would have to make his own travel arrangements since New Zealand lacked a diplomatic presence in Syria. She also warned that he would face an investigation in New Zealand due to his association with terrorist organisations. Similar sentiments were echoed by Justice Minister Andrew Little while the Green Party's Justice spokesperson Golriz Ghahraman has stated Taylor should cooperate with Kurdish forces and the UN to extradite to NZ. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has described Taylor as a traitor to his country and Western civilization, opining that he had forfeited his right to return to New Zealand by joining ISIS. National Party leader and Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges has stated that New Zealand was in no hurry to take Taylor back and that he should face prison for his involvement with a terrorist group. National Party Deputy Leader Paula Bennett and New Zealand First Member of Parliament and government minister Shane Jones have described Taylor as a disgrace to New Zealand and said he should face justice. Media and public responses Media coverage of Taylor's capture has drawn considerable media coverage and public commentary. Several New Zealand academics including University of Waikato law professor Alexander Gillespie, University of Otago political scientist Robert Patman, and University of Auckland political scientist Chris Wilson have welcomed the New Zealand Government's decision not to strip Taylor of his citizenship and called for Taylor to face trial in New Zealand. New Zealand radio and television broadcaster Mike Hosking has criticised Ardern's decision not to strip Taylor of his citizenship. By contrast, broadcaster Andrew Dickens has rejected calls to strip Taylor of his citizenship, describing it as a policy characteristic of totalitarian regimes. Similar sentiments were echoed by the editorial of The Press newspaper. International security analyst Paul Buchanan has argued that Taylor is a prisoner of war who could provide valuable intelligence to the New Zealand authorities. Buchanan has also opined that Taylor could also face war crime charges if he is linked to war crimes such as complicity in slavery and executions.

He was the author, editor and translator of numerous works covering legal, constitutional, historic and military topics, and a leading authority on European jurisprudence and the Constitution of the United Kingdom and British colonies. Dr Philip Arthur Ashworth was the first to translate Leopold von Ranke's History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514 into English in 1887, as well as several other important German academic works on legal, constitutional, historic and military matters. Dresden in Saxony where, in April 1879, Philip Arthur Ashworth married Emma Charlotte Marie Leontina, Baroness von Estorff.  Early life and education  Philip Arthur Ashworth was the eldest son of the Rev John Ashworth Ashworth, rector of Didcot in Berkshire. His father had been a Fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford until forced to resign on marriage in 1851, whereupon his college preferred him to the rectory of All Saints, Didcot which he occupied for 39 years. The Perpendicular west window of the church is a memorial to the Ashworth family. Philip Arthur Ashworth was educated at Sherborne, subsequently graduating with a BA from New College, Oxford in Classics and Law in 1875, before proceeding to study at the University of Bonn, the University of Leipzig and the University of W√ºrzburg, from which he emerged as a Doctor of Jurisprudence which, in Germany, is the terminal degree in law. Who's Who, Volume 72, A & C Black, 1920 In 1881 Dr Ashworth was called to the bar in England (Inner Temple) and practised for a while in London and was briefly an advocate of the Courts of Cyprus, however his attention rapidly became wholly absorbed by his continuing research and writing on international jurisprudence and English constitutional law and administration.  Major works  A profoundly learned and scholarly man, Dr Ashworth was a prolific and important bilingual author, editor and translator of works on legal, constitutional, historic and military topics. His immense, and on occasions unrivalled, grasp of his specialist fields enabled him to bring immense clarity to often intensely complex topics, while always writing with scrupulous care and accurate scholarship, whether in English or in German. Amongst other works and many papers, he was the author of: * Das Wittthum (Dower) im Englischen Recht, Frankfurt am Main, 1898; a study of the ancient laws of Dower in England. * Die Verfassungen der Brittischen Kolonien, T√ºbingen, 1911; a landmark examination of the constitutional law of the English colonies, it formed part of the German series on political science, administrative law and constitutional law, Das √ñffentliche Recht der Gegenwart. As an editor, Dr Ashworth was tasked with revising the 5th, 6th and 7th editions of: * English Constitutional History: a Text-book for Students and Others, by Thomas Pitt Taswell-Langmead, London, 1896. He was the first translator into English of several important German legal, history and military works including: * Battle for Right, by Rudolf von Jhering, London, 1883. * A History of the English Constitution, by Rudolf von Gneist, London, 1886. * History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations from 1494 to 1514, by Leopold von Ranke, London, 1887. * The Nation in Arms, by Baron von der Goltz, London, 1887, a work that had a considerable impact on military thought and the role of armed forces within society around the world. Dr Ashworth was also asked to contribute articles to Encyclopaedia Britannica's 10th and 11th editions on Alsace-Lorraine, Bavaria, Berlin, Germany, Heinrich Rudolf Hermann Friedrich von Gneist, Rudolf von Jhering, L√ºbeck, Rhine, and Eduard von Simson.  Family  On 15 April 1879 Dr Ashworth married Emma Charlotte Marie Leontina Von Estorff, Baroness von Estorff (1853‚Äì1935) Dresden, Deutschland, Heiratsregister, 1876‚Äì1922 (n√©e Sonntag), whose younger sister, Elizabeth, was a musician and composer who married the academic historian and classicist Sir James Wycliffe Headlam- Morley. Who's Who, Volume 72, A & C Black, 1920 Philip and Emma Ashworth lived in Victoria Street, Westminster and their country house in Berkshire, until retiring in 1902 to Kent. Kelly's Directory of Kent, 1903 Dr Ashworth died in Paris in 1921. His widow died in Oxfordshire in 1935. By the late twentieth century, Dr Ashworth's childhood home, now the Old Rectory at Didcot, had become home to another Oxford historian with a keen interest in German militarism, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Lord Dacre.

The following is a list of characters who have appeared. Watchmen universe  Crimebusters  The Crimebusters is a superhero group that succeeds the Minutemen. The group was short-lived when the Keene Act that forbade non- government sanctioned superheroes was passed. Among its notable members are: * Comedian / Edward Blake ‚Äî A former member of the Minutemen and the Crimebusters whose death was prevented by Doctor Manhattan. He then began his revenge crusade against Ozymandias for attempting to kill him, as well as continuing on the trail of Mime and Marionette. Comedian catches up to Joker, Mime, and Marionette when they attend an underground villain meeting held by Riddler to discuss the Superman Theory. He makes himself known by shooting Typhoon in the face. While pursuing them, he evades Giganta's attacks, shoots Riddler in the leg, and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present. When Mime and Marionette are in bed together the next morning, Comedian catches up to them where he plans to use them to find Ozymandias. Before Comedian can do anything, Joker comes to Mime and Marionette's rescue and stuns Comedian with a joy buzzer. As Batman gets free and fights Joker, Mime and Marionette escape with Comedian and the Lantern Battery. After non-fatally shooting Oyzmandias, Comedian is returned to his spot in time. * Doctor Manhattan / Jonathan Osterman ‚Äî A former member of the Crimebusters who remains skeptical of humanity's hope. He is suspected for altering the DC Universe following the Flashpoint event, and for making \\"experiments\\" in the lives of Superman and everyone else.

When Rorschach II returns with the two, Veidt reveals himself and his situation, explaining to the two criminals that they must follow Manhattan to another universe and convince him to save their world. Using the Owlship, Veidt and his group travel to the DC Universe just as nuclear war breaks out on their Earth. After conducting research on this new world he's found himself in, Veidt goes to Metropolis to ask Lex Luthor to join his quest. However, as he is pleading his case, Veidt is shocked to find himself being confronted by the Comedian, who has been transported to the DC Universe by Manhattan. Comedian turns out to be evenly matched with Veidt, forcing him to retreat through Luthor's office window. Veidt falls twenty stories and is hospitalized with minor injuries, but soon manages to escape. Upon returning to the Owlship, Veidt is confronted by Batman, who has read the contents of the original Rorschach's journal. As the two elude the police, Batman asserts that Veidt murdered millions as part of a delusional hero syndrome, and accuses him of concocting a conspiracy theory that has negatively affected the public's trust in the superheroes of the DC Universe. Veidt in turn criticizes Batman for focusing all his attention on chasing supervillains while ignoring the world's social problems. A struggle ensues, leading to Batman falling out of the Owlship and into a mob of anti-hero protestors below. Using his pet lynx, Bubastis II, and Alan Scott's Green Lantern Power Battery, Veidt teleports Doctor Manhattan to the Joker's lair, where Batman is fighting Marionette and Mime.

Michigan Ave. in Jackson, Michigan. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. History The Peoples National Bank was organized in 1865, and was at the time the only national bank in Jackson. It was originally housed in a four- story mansard roof building, located at the same location as the present bank building. In 1916, the bank decided to construct a new building, demolishing the old one. The bank hired the Hoggson Brothers firm, of New York City and Chicago, to design, build, equip the building. The New York City firm of Rocker & Vatet were the architects. The new building opened in 1917. In 1929, Peoples National Bank merged with the National Union Bank to become the Union & Peoples National Bank. The new bank vacated the building, opting to construct a new headquarters. The new eventually became part of the then newly established Guardian Detroit Union Group, Inc; this entity suffered substantial losses during the Great Depression, was declared insolvent and closed in 1933, and never re-opened. The vacated banking space in the People's National Building was filled in 1931 when the Elaine Shop, a women's wear store, moved from their original location at 144 East Michigan Avenue after substantially remodeling the space. The Elaine Shop was very successful, and expanded to the second floor in 1943, and the entire building in 1946. However, sales declined by the late 1960s, and it went out of businessin 1971. IN 1972, the building was converted into apartments, known as the Elaine Apartments. Description The Peoples National Bank Building is a narrow, nine-story Neoclassical commercial and office building. It has a two-story based clad with golden cream colored Mankato stone, above which is a gray brick upper portion with terra cotta trim. It is located at the corner of Michigan and Mechanic, and runs for three bays along Michigan and nine along Mechanic. An entablature with cornice runs above the eighth floor, and a broadly projecting metal cornice runs along the front and side roofline. The first and second story base section reflects the 1931 Art Deco refurbishment of the building. In contains a two-story tall central entrance on the Michigan Avenue side, framed with an Art Deco stylized architrave. This is flanked by large storefront windows with brass trim on the first floor, and small casement windows on the second. Above this is a single window opening on each floor on the two outer bays, and a double opening on the inner bay.

This genus resembles Pseudaxinoides in having a single row of clamps on one side of the body and one row of lateral vaginal openings on each side of body . However, it differs from it in having testes preovarial, ovarial and postovarial. Sibitrema can be distinguished by other monogeneans by the following features: *A narrow \\"neck\\" between anterior mam part of body and opisthaptor. * Testes preovarial, ovarial and postovarial. * One row of lateral vaginal openings on each side of body. Morphology Individuals of species of Sibitrema, like any typical polyopisthocotylean monogenean, have an anterior organ called prohaptor, which is mainly used for feeding and attachment. Although the prohaptor is not the primary attachment organ, it is used to anchor the body of the parasite while the opisthaptor is being repositioned. The opisthaptor is an important attachment organ that allows these ectoparasites to latch onto their hosts. The body is partly scalloped, extremely long, and consist of three parts: a long wide anterior part gradually tapering anteriorly in its anterior half or third,a narrow neck, and a long haptor. Located at the anterior part of the worm is the funnel-shaped mouth that is connected to the pharynx which is larger than the buccal suckers, followed by the long wide oesophagus esophagus that is smaller in diameter compared to the pharynx. The esophagus then divides into intestinal crura, which extends further posteriorly. The cruca is divided into pouches, which extend between vitellaria. Vitallaria are glands that secrete yolk around the egg. This digestive pathway is observed to be continuous throughout the entire worm. The worms are hermaphroditic, containing both male and female organs. Each worm has reproductive organs such as vas deferens, testis, uterus, vitelline duct, ovary, and vitellaria. They also have flame cells that function as a kidney and remove waste material. A short duct that opens to the outside on the dorsal surface is composed of four canals on each side, two posterior and two anterior, that come together laterally to the cirrus. During observation on immature specimens, these canals can still be seen. However, on adults, these canals are concealed by vitellaria.

A self-made man, Mahadev was from a humble family. He became an editor of two journals in 1870. Namjoshi recognized the significance of western education in India in order to reawaken the conscience and arouse the intellect of the student community. With this in mind, he started new periodicals like Kiran, Deccan Star, Shilpa kalavidnyan and the Industrial review. His contribution to establishment of industrial conference and the industrial association in Pune was significant. Namjoshi was part of the formation of New English school and was also an elected member of the Pune municipality. As an active fund-raiser he persuaded southern Maratha country to contribute towards the establishment of Ferguson college. However, his chief interest was promotion of Indian industry and for this he often sought quick action instead of long winded discussions. In 1888, Namjoshi approached the government for help to establish contact with various artisans, their functioning and imparting them knowledge in modern methods of manufacturing, tools, machine tools and hand machines and also work out who and how would goods be transported. He explored the possibility of active cooperation from the local municipal boards in this regard.Namjoshi also spoke on behalf of specific industries. He stressed the need for protection of handloom workers who couldn't compete against the modern mechanized textile industry. He spoke about the brass metal industry especially about he ignorance and lack of usage of labour saving devices like lathers, hammers, cutters, planing and milling machines. He was a close associate of Lokmanya Tilak since 1880s. After the foundation of Indian national congress in 1885, Namjoshi complained about the lack of representative committee.

Biography John Young was born in the parish of John‚Äôs St., Limerick, in March 1746 into a well-to-do merchant family. his early education was in Limerick and he later left to study at the Pastoral College of the Irish, Louvain, where he received an M.A. and a Ph.D., he was ordained in Louvain on 23 September 1769. There were two other Irish colleges in Louvain, one for Franciscans and one for Dominicans but Young attended the one for seculars. He worked in Limerick city until he was appointed PP in Bruff in 1782. Nine years later he went as PP to St. Mary‚Äôs and became dean of the cathedral chapter. On 3 January 1793, he was appointed coadjutor to the Bishop of Limerick and subsequently consecrated by Archbishop Bray of Cashel on 20 May. He succeeded to the see on 19 June 1796 with the death of Bishop Conway. One of his priorities as bishop was the opening of St Munchin's College, Palmerstown, in November 1796. The college moved on a number of occasions until it settled at Park house, Corbally. The house also functioned as the presbytery for the parish of St Patrick. He started this project with ¬£450 left by Bishop Conway to provide for the education of priests. Another educational endeavour was the production of a catechism including an Irish edition. He was deeply involved in local politics at the end of the eighteenth century and was well known on the national stage. One issue he was particularly well known for was his opposition to the proposal that Catholic priests receive a state salary in return for a government veto on bishops. His rationale was outlined in a letter he sent to the Archbishop of Cahsel. \\"I think the government well intended, but it may destroy confidence in the flock, create contentions, and open a door for government patronage, intrigue and simony. On the whole, as far as I can see, I am against it either for all or for nay, even the needy. So is Dr McMahon\\". This was proposed initially by the Chief Secretary Castlereagh. On the other hand Young was an enthuasistic supporter of another project promoted by Castlereagh, that is the Act of Union. The corruption of the Irish parliament at the time played a part in this as it was not friendly towards the Catholic majority. He died on 22 September 1813, at Park House, Corbally and is buried in St. Patrick‚Äôs cemetery, off the Tipperary road.

Development These locomotives were a development of the preceding 2-4-0Ts also by William Wakefield with the first two, No. 11 St Kevin in 1896 and No. 3 being new builds. Four more subsequently constructed by rebuilding Wakefields 2-4-0T locomotives. These were all later to form Great Southern Railways (GSR) class 428. The succeeding locomotive engineer Cronin was to build 6 more similar locomotives which were allocated GSR class 434. In practice during their lifetimes all twelve were subject to regular rebuilds with over 5 different types of boiler fitted. They were an improvement over their 2-4-0T forebears, with coal capacity up from 1.5 tons to 2.5 tons and water capacity nearly doubled to meaning less frequent fill ups. The tractive effort increase by about was also useful. Service The locomotives served the Dublin south suburban area until the rename of the DW&WR; to the Dublin and South Eastern Railway (DSER) and on into the Great Southern Railways grouping in 1925. They were allocated the numbers 428‚Äî439 at this time, however No. 10, St. Senanus, was allocated a GSR number 429 but ultimately was declared a Civil War loss.

Parallax measurements by the Gaia space observatory put the star at a distance of about from Earth. It is likely a member of the Upper Sco Association, and is young enough that it has not yet become a main-sequence star yet. Unusual light fluctuations of the star, including up to an 80% dimming in brightness (i.e., \\"single 80% deep occultation of 1-day duration\\"), were observed by astronomers. The unusual dimming was not only extremely deep, but also substantially asymmetric, with an egress about twice as long as the ingress. Nonetheless, such an unusual dimming for EPIC 204376071 is much greater than the 22% dimming observed for Tabby's star. Several explanations have been presented to explain the unusual dimming of the EPIC 204376071 star: one, orbiting dust or small particles; or two, a \\"transient accretion event of dusty material near the corotation radius of the star\\". The unusual lightcurve of the star is similar to the lightcurve of a candidate exoplanet, KIC 10403228, which may have been caused by a \\"tilted ring system\\" orbiting the planet.

The series was viewed as a new female counterpart to the Super Sentai series due to including female-oriented interests, which were often seen in media targeted to young girls. Sumiko Kodama from Confidence also noted that the show's integration of J-pop elements in collaboration with LDH also made the presentation easy for audiences of all ages to enjoy, as Miracle¬≤'s real-life debut would remind older audiences of Speed. Editors at Real Sound believe the popularity came from the revived interest in live-action tokusatsu shows aimed at a female audience, which had declined in the early 1990s due to competing toy sales with Sailor Moon and growing interest in magical girl anime series. The success of the show led to it being a direct competitor to other magical girl series for children, particularly the Pretty Cure series.

It was common practice among Leiden's students to have a group portrait taken by Kiek at his workshop on the Rijnsburgersingel. Groups of students would regularly appear on his doorstep in the early morning, after a long night of drinking, banging on the door to wake him and get their picture taken. The students' behaviour became so bad that Kiek eventually had a fence and raisable bridge installed to keep them out.\\"Kiekmonument\\", Leiden.nl (Dutch, archived)\\"Uitgefofen muzenzonen\\", Leids Universitair Weekblad Mare, 8 October 2015 (Dutch) The student portraits were often not of the highest quality.

In the 1840s, the couple returned to Groningen, then moved to Amsterdam in 1852 before settling in Leiden in 1855.\\"Isra√´l David Kiek\\", Joods Erfgoed Rotterdam (Dutch) Kiek may have experimented with daguerreotype photography at a young age, while still in Groningen. The first mention of Kiek as a portrait photographer was in 1858. He remained active as a photographer until at least 1889. Four of his sons (David, Abraham, Louis and Lion Kiek) followed in his footsteps and became photographers after learning the ropes in Kiek's workshop. He worked not only in Leiden but also as a travelling photographer in other towns, including Gorinchem, Assen and Utrecht. In 1896-1898 he lived in Arnhem, before returning to Leiden, where he died at the age of 88.  Remembrance  In 2001 the Kiekmonument, a monument to the photographer, was unveiled on the Rijnsburgersingel in Leiden, directly across from Kiek's former workshop. The monument is a work of art depicting a camera placed on a tripod. Peering looking through the camera viewer reveals 12 different photos taken by Kiek.

While missioned to convoy natives from Africa for ethnographic spectacles at the Louisiana Puchase Exposition feat. World's Fair of 1904 in the United States. Most well-known among Verner's activites was the pygmy Ota Benga, unique survivor of its clan, who appeared in human spectacles and conferences but had been last as a captive in the Bronx zoo until 1906, september 27th when George B. McClellan Jr. the mayor of New York City ordered to release him immediately.  Biography  Verner in Congo, 1902The first son of a South Carolina Presbyterian slave-holding family, he studied in Columbia and then went to the University of South Carolina graduating in 1892 as the best of his class. After suffering a mental breakdown he worked as a laborer in the railroads for about a year. He then moved to work for his uncle A.L. Phillips in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Here he taught at the Stillman Institute of which his uncle was a superintendent. He had begun to read the works of David Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley on African travels and got in touch with the family of Samuel N. Lapsley, the first Presbyterian missionary who died in the Congo. He decided to move to Africa in 1895 on appeals from Dr S.H. Chester who was the secretary for the Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church. Verner was ordained under an extraordinary clause on 25 September 1895 at the Tuscaloosa Presbytery after an examination in various subjects. He and Joseph Phipps sailed from New York to London aboard New York and from Southampton to Antwerp and finally aboard the R.M.S. Roquelle to Matadi in Congo. Verner stayed in the Congo and studied the Tshiluba language. On 15 December 1897 while out on a hill near Ndombe he fell into a trap for animals and was pierced by a poisoned stake. His african assistant, Kassongo, ran to the nearby village of Bindundu and he was treated by a medicine woman. After two weeks he returned to Ndombe and he continued to recuperate even a year later in Baltimore. The account of his injury has been questioned by Pamela Newkirk in her book. She also notes that Verner left at least two children that he fathered with a Congolese woman in Luebo. In 1898 he brought three Congolese assistants who he intended to teach English and other skills before returning them. This included Kassongo who was killed in a stampede in 1902 at Birmingham where he went to hear Booker T. Washington. In the 1900s he made visits again to bring African peoples to the United States. Samuel Phillips Verner resigned from missionary work in 1899. Verner wrote articles based on his African experiences and was considered an expert among others on the pygmies and on various matters of african colonialism. Verner became a friend of William Temple Hornaday to whom he brought chimpanzees. Verner had been hired to procure specimens of African natives for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition and World's Fair of 1904. Verner brought 12 people, among them Ota Benga, from near the confluence of the Kasai and Sankuru rivers where he claimed that the Baschilele people had held Benga captive. 1906 Ota Benga experienced cultural ban from the twa clan he lived with in Congo. SO he came back to New York with Verner, who got in touch with Hornaday. He arranged that Ota Benga would exhibit at the Bronx Zoo. First the show attracted visitors but the conditions of Ota Benga went degrading until he was treated like a captive. The situation chocked the visitors and they obtained his release from the mayor George B. McClellan Jr. Verner may have been subject of controversy due to some aspects of his activities in contradiction to the nationwide ban in the United States implemented under the Thirteenth Amendment. This was ratified on December 6, 1865, even if the last slave contingent came in 1885. Earlier national laws had greatly restricted slavery in the United States. These include the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves on 1 January 1808, it created the felony to import slaves from abroad but not from stateless countries. Verner claimed that Benga was free and that he did not gain from the exhibition of Benga at the zoo. Verner appears to have gone into obscurity after the Ota Benga affair. In 1912, a patent application for a trapezoidal animal trap gives his address as living in the Obispo Panama canal area. A book on Ota Benga was written by Verner's grandson Phillips Verner Bradford.

Sibitrema poonui was described based on 48 specimens from the gills of Cybiosarda elegans and Euthynnus alleteratus off Australia. Australian specimens has a larger body size and differed also in some organ sizes. The differences between the Hawaiian and Australian populations were not significant, especially in view of the identical structure of the genital atrium, the clamps, the hooks and the vaginae. Description Sibitrema poonui has a smooth or partly scalloped, extremely body, consi1stmg of three parts: a long wide anterior part gradually tapering anteriorly in its anterior half or third, a narrow neck, and a long opisthaptor. The body comprises an anterior part which contains most organs and a posterior part called the haptor. The haptor is long, gradually tapering posteriorly, on one side with one row of 29-49 clamps. The clamps of the haptor attach the animal to the gill of the fish. A long terminal lappet is present, and is armed with two pairs of hooks. There are also two buccal suckers at the anterior extremity. The digestive organs include an anterior mouth, a pharynx larger than buccal suckers, a long wide oesophagus without diverticula and a posterior intestine that bifurcates in two lateral branches. The intestinal branches are provided with medial and lateral diverticula, joined in posterior part of opisthaptor and extending as a single branch with short diverticula to level of most posterior clamps, or not joined and one branch terminate some distance in front of the other. Each adult contains male and female reproductive organs. The reproductive organs include an anterior genital atrium armed with a single circle of curved terminally bifurcated spines, one row of ventrolateral vaginal openings on each side of the body behind the level of gonopore, each opening surrounded by muscles, a foldedovary and numerous large irregularly shaped testespre, para and post- ovarian. Eggs are fusiform, with filaments at both ends. Hosts and localities The type-host is the bigeye tuna Thunnus obesus (Scombridae).

Headquartered in Ames, Iowa, the company operates 13 biorefineries throughout the United States and Germany. As of 2018, the company is a Fortune 1000 corporation.  History  Renewable Energy Group began in 1996 as the biodiesel division of West Central Cooperative with the construction of a plant in Ralston, Iowa. In 2006, the company separated from West Central and moved its headquarters to Ames. In 2008, REG acquired their Houston biorefinery, followed by Danville and Seneca, Illinois; Newton, Iowa; and Clovis, New Mexico in 2010. Their Albert Lea, Minnesota biorefinery was acquired in 2011, then New Boston, Texas in 2012. The Mason City, Iowa biorefinery was acquired in 2013, the Geismar, Louisiana facility in 2014, the Grays Harbor, Washington facility in 2015, and the Madison, Wisconsin facility in 2016. They finally acquired full ownership of Petrotec AG in 2016 which includes two biorefineries and a feedstock collection and processing facility in Germany.  Sustainability  REG delivers cleaner fuels to meet growing global demand. REG produced 495 million gallons of biodiesel in 2019, which generates 4.2 million metric tons of carbon reduction. This is equivalent to greenhouse gas emissions from 10.4 billion miles driven by an average passenger vehicle, CO2 emissions from 4.6 billion pounds of coal burned, or CO2 sequestered by 5.5 million acres of U.S. forests in one year. In 2018, Renewable Energy Group launched REG Ultra Clean‚Ñ¢ Diesel, a blend of biodiesel and renewable diesel, making it one of the lowest carbon intensity liquid fuels available. The patent-pending combination delivers renewable diesel's high Cetane and low Cloud Point in a 100% renewable fuel. REG Ultra Clean reduces emissions enough to be an approved fuel by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), one of the most stringent clean air standards in the world. In 2019, REG opened its first branded fuel station, allowing them to sell higher blends of biodiesel directly to end-use customers. Based in Seneca, Illinois next to their biodiesel plant, the station is open to the public and is especially convenient for the more than 16,000 trucks that visit the plant every year.

The unit continued in the Territorial Army after World War II. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle and Artillery Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 1‚Äì4.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8.

A new 4th Hampshire AVC was formed at Bournemouth on 29 November 1866 (a 5th (Dockyard) Hampshire AVC may have been formed on 18 August 1860, but had quickly been disbanded).

In 1882 all the artillery volunteers were affiliated to one or other of the territorial garrison divisions of the Royal Artillery (RA) and the 1st Hampshire AVC became the 1st Volunteer (Hampshire) Brigade of the Southern Division, with HQ moving to Southsea. In 1886 the Dorset companies were separated to form an independent 1st Dorsetshire AVC as the 2nd Volunteer Brigade of the Southern Division, and on 25 April 1888 the Southampton companies were withdrawn to form the 3rd Volunteer (Hampshire) Brigade, Southern Division. Finally, the Hampshire brigades were renumbered in December 1889, the 3rd (descended from the original 1st AVC) becoming the 1st Hampshire AVC at Southampton and the 1st (from the original 2nd and 3rd) becoming the 2nd Hampshire AVC at Portsmouth. The 1st Hampshire AVC opened its drill hall in St Mary's Road, Southampton, in 1889.Southampton at Drill Hall Project. By 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the 1st Hampshire Artillery Volunteers to the Portsmouth fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 In 1899 the RA was divided into separate field and garrison branches, and the artillery volunteers were all assigned to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). In 1902 the divisional structure was abolished and the unit titles were changed, the 1st Hampshire AVC becoming the 1st Hampshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers), with its HQ at St Mary's Road. Territorial Force When the Territorial Force (TF) was created from the old Volunteer Force under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Beckett, pp. 247‚Äì53.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 1st Hampshire RGA (V) was to join with the Dorsetshire RGA (V) once again to become the Hants & Dorset RGA, but this was changed back to separate Dorset and Hampshire units in 1910.

There were a large number of forts and batteries around Spithead and the Solent, controlling access to Portsmouth Harbour and Southampton Water, which in time of war would be manned by four Regular RGA companies and the Hampshire RGA.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 4. World War I Mobilisation On the outbreak of war the Hampshire RGA mobilised under the command of Lt-Col J.E. Dawe, TD. Shortly afterwards TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and on 15 August 1914, the War Office (WO) issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate companies and batteries were created, releasing the 1st Line units to be sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. By October 1914, the campaign on the Western Front was bogging down into Trench warfare and there was an urgent need for batteries of Siege artillery to be sent to France. The WO decided that the TF coastal gunners were well enough trained to take over many of the duties in the coastal defences, releasing Regular RGA gunners for service in the field, and 1st line RGA companies had been authorised to increase their strength by 50 per cent.WO Instruction No 248 of October 1914. Although complete TF defended ports units never left the UK, they did supply drafts of trained gunners to RGA units serving overseas. These included providing cadres as the basis on which to form complete new units for front line service. 147th Siege Battery was formed at Portsmouth on 22 May 1916 based on a cadre of four officers and 78 other ranks from the Hampshire RGA (probably drawn in the main from 1/1st Heavy Bty, which disappeared from the order of battle by April 1917).Army Council Instruction 1091 of 29 May 1916. A large number of other siege batteries were formed in the Portsmouth defences in 1915‚Äì16, which may also have included trained men from the Hampshire RGA among the recruits, although the Army Council Instructions did not specifically order this.Army Council Instructions, 1915‚Äì1916. For example, 27 members of No 4 Company died on active service during the war, even though its 1st and 2nd Line never left the UK.IWM War Memorial Register ref 40535.Royal Garrison Church at Memorials and Monuments in Portsmouth. Home Defence After the beginning of air attacks on Britain the RGA also became responsible for manning anti-aircraft (AA) guns both at home and overseas. A number of AA batteries were stationed round Portsmouth, probably including men drawn from the Hampshire RGA, and Southern Command was also responsible for the AA defence of Coventry and Birmingham, where some Hampshire RGA companies were stationed. Under Army Council Instruction 686 of April 1917, the coastal defence companies of the RGA (TF) were reorganised. The 12 remaining Hampshire RGA companies serving in the Portsmouth garrison and the Coventry and Birmingham AA command (1/2nd, 1/3rd, 1/4th, 1/5th, 1/6th, 1/7th, 1/8th, 2/3rd, 2/4th, 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th) were reduced to two companies, which were to be kept up to strength with non-TF recruits.Army Council Instructions April 1917.Farndale, Forgotten Fronts, Annex 3. Crew positioning a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer in 1918. 147th Siege Battery, RGA I47th Siege Battery went out to the Western Front on 21 August 1916, equipped with four 6-inch howitzers. On 25 August it joined 33rd Heavy Artillery Group (HAG) serving with Fourth Army, which was engaged in the Somme offensive. The battery moved to 49th HAG on 29 October as the offensive ground to a conclusion and then to others within Fourth Army (77th HAG on 20 December, 28th HAG on 10 February) during the winter of 1916‚Äì17.'Allocation of Siege Batteries RGA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/4.'Headquarters Heavy Artillery Groups', TNA file WO 95/5494/1.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 102‚Äì8. Vimy Ridge On 22 March 1917 the battery transferred to 18th HAG with First Army, which was preparing for the Battle of Vimy Ridge. 18th HAG was positioned just behind Arras, firing in support of Canadian Corps. The artillery plan for the heavy guns emphasised counter-battery (CB) fire. At Zero hour, while the field guns laid down a Creeping barrage to protect the advancing infantry, the heavy howitzers fired further ahead to hit the rear areas on the reverse slope of the ridge, especially known gun positions. The attack went in on 9 April with the Canadian and I Corps successfully capturing Vimy Ridge.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 74‚Äì8.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 164‚Äì6, 174‚Äì6, Map 23.Cave, pp. 119‚Äì27, Map p. 121. 6-inch howitzer being moved through mud on the Western Front. Fighting south of Vimy (the Battle of Arras) continued into May, with 147th Siege Bty joining 83rd HAG with Third Army on 25 May.Becke, Pt 4, pp. 92‚Äì8. It was back to 18th HAG in First Army on 16 June, at rest and training 8‚Äì24 August, and then joined 78th HAG on 3 September. Later that month the battery was reorganised, a section from the newly-arrived 446th Siege Bty joining on 22 September, bringing 147th up to a strength of six howitzers. On 16 December the battery was reduced to four guns once more, with a section leaving to join 190th Siege Bty, and joined 43rd HAG with Fourth Army the following day. The battery was at rest from 23 December to 9 January 1918. By now HAG allocations were becoming more fixed, and on 1 February 1918 they were converted into permanent RGA brigades. 43rd Brigade was composed of units with a variety of different calibre howitzers. 147th Siege Bty remained with this brigade until the Armistice.Farndale, Western Front, Annex E.Farndale, Western Front, Annex M. Fifth Ypres In March or April the battery was once more made up to a strength of six howitzers. 43rd Brigade RGA transferred from Fourth to Second Army on 1 May 1918 and remained with it until the Armistice, fighting through the Allied Hundred Days Offensive.Becke Pt 4, pp. 82‚Äì7. For example, at the Fifth Battle of Ypres starting on 28 September, 43rd Bde's batteries directly supported the assault of 29th Division, having remained hidden and silent until Zero hour. When the infantry attacked at 05.30 they quickly took their intermediate objectives (06.30) and first objectives (08.30‚Äì08.45). The second wave then passed through to continue the advance towards the village of Kruiseecke, but had to halt until 12.15, because the heavy artillery barrage was still falling on the village. Such rapid progress could not be kept up, and German reinforcements halted further advances, but 29th Division had crossed the Ypres Ridge, the objective of so many failed assaults in 1917.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 61‚Äì7. After that Second Army continued to advance through October until it reached the River Dendre by the time the Armistice came in to force. 147th Siege Battery was disbanded in 1919. Interwar The Hampshire RGA was placed in suspended animation after demobilisation in 1919. It reformed in 1920, still under the command of Brevet Colonel J.E. Dawe. When the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 the title was changed to Hampshire Coast Brigade, RGA, and when the RGA was subsumed into the RA in 1924 it became the Hampshire Heavy Brigade, RA. It formed part of the coast defence troops in 43rd (Wessex) Divisional Area and had the following organisation:Titles and Designations 1927.

The unit was redesignated the Hampshire Heavy Regiment, RA in 1938 when the RA adopted the term 'regiment' instead of 'brigade' for a lieutenant-colonel's command. World War II Mobilisation On the outbreak of war the regiment and its three batteries mobilised in the Portsmouth Defences.Southern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. With the danger of invasion after the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from Dunkirk, the coastal artillery regiments underwent a major reorganisation in the summer of 1940. In September the Hampshire Heavy Rgt expanded to form three new regiments:Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 20: Coast Artillery, 1 June 1941, TNA file WO 212/117.

Then in April 1944 529th Coast Rgt was placed in suspended animation, the batteries joining 527th. Finally in June 1945, after VE Day, 527th Coast Rgt was also placed in suspended animation. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 529th Coast Rgt was formally disbanded, and 527th was reformed as 406th (Hampshire) Coast Rgt in 102 Coast Brigade.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.372‚Äì413 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Coast Bdes RA at British Army 1945 onwards. The coast artillery branch of the RA was abolished during 1956, the regiment being officially disbanded on 15 September, but on 31 October it was instead converted to the Royal Engineers as 581 Construction Squadron, RE. It was assigned to 115 Construction Rgt which reorganised as 115 (Hampshire Fortress) Corps Engineer Rgt in 1961. The squadron was disbanded on 1 April 1967 when the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR), and the remaining personnel joined D (Hampshire Fortress Engineers) Sqn in the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Territorials.Litchfield, pp. 5‚Äì6.576‚Äì873 Sqns RE at British Army 1945 onwards.

Centered on a stretch of Intervale Street, the area was developed in the early 20th century during a major Jewish migration, and includes a fine sample of Colonial Revival architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. Description and history Intervale Street is located in the central Dorchester area known as Grove Hall, extending roughly westward from Columbia Road toward Blue Hill Avenue. It is lined almost entirely with residential construction, with a portion of Ceylon Park, a public park, abutting it near its northeastern corner. The south side of the street, near its eastern end, is the location of the historic district, which also includes two buildings on the north side at the corner of Columbia Road. These buildings are all three stories in height, with brick construction in the Colonial Revival style trimmed in stone. Typical construction includes projection polygonal bays, with sash windows topped by shouldered lintels, and entrances framed by columns and pediments. The Intervale Street area had originally been developed in the 19th century with a series of wood-frame residences. Beginning about 1910, a major migration of Jews from Boston's North End and the adjacent city of Chelsea began, spurred by the extension of electrified streetcar service, and a major 1908 fire in Chelsea which left more than 15,000 Jews homeless. This area was walking distance to a synagogue built at Crawford Street in Roxbury in 1915, which became one of the major centers of Jewish life in Boston in the first half of the 20th century.

This route plays an important role in rail transportation of Mysore division of Karnataka state. The corridor passes through the Western Ghats and the Mysore Plateau, connecting the mainland to the coastal areas of Karnataka with a stretch of 309 km with one reversal direction at . It is divided into two sections: ‚Äî and Hassan ‚Äî .  History  The railway line from Hassan to Mangalore was originally built as a metre gauge line and was opened in small sections between 1976 and 1977, inaugurated finally on 20 May 1979 for passenger transportation. 17 years later it was closed for gauge conversion, on 20 September 1996. The ghat sub-section between Sakleshpur and was considered a challenging section. The gauge conversion of this section was handed over to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), formed for the task - the Hassan Mangalore Rail Development Company Limited (HMRDC). The company has the Government of Karnataka and the Railway Ministry as majority stakeholders, while Mangalore port trust and a couple of other bodies as minority stakeholders. The gauge conversion took a very long time and is marked in red-letters in the Indian Railways' history. Although the first section after the conversion was opened in January 1998, the rest of the works were done at very slow pace. The first sub-section to be opened was ‚Äì Sakleshpur, a distance of about 42 km. The next stretch to be inaugurated was between and Kabaka Puttur, a distance of about 44 km, opened in December 2003. Another section of the line from Kabaka Puttur to , 42 km, was opened in July 2005. The remaining final stretch (Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya), a ghat section with 1 in 55 grades all along, was opened in May 2006 for freight services and in December 2007 for passenger operations. As per the railway budget 1995-96, the Hassan-Mysore section was also proposed to gauge conversion to 5ft6in broad gauge.  Projects  There is a proposal for doubling the Mangalore‚ÄìHassan‚ÄìMysore line with electrification for reduction of time travelling between the coastal and plateau regions of Karnataka which will be a boon for the economy on this route.

Biography  Barker was born in Jamestown, Eastern Cape to Joseph Barker (of Seaham, County Durham) and his wife Beatrice (n√©e Cusons). The family moved to East London where she matriculated at East London Girls High School. Barker went on to complete a BSc in botany and zoology at Rhodes University College in 1928. The Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns awarded her the Junior Captain Scott medals in both subjects as she had attained the highest marks in her class. She was offered a scholarship to complete a MSc in botany but declined in favour of the Edward Muspratt Solly Scholarship offered by the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, starting in 1929. Agapanthus africanus During the two years of her scholarship, Barker was supervised by H.M.L. Bolus in her studies including taxonomy, herbarium maintenance and fieldwork. She spent from February 1931 to July 1933 at Kew Gardens broadening her herbarium experience. She returned to Kirstenbosch in 1933 and was appointed Botanical Assistant to the Director working in the Bolus Herbarium, until it was agreed to relocate it to the University of Cape Town in 1934 (the relocation only happened in 1938). In 1935 Barker began to accumulate specimens for an independent herbarium for Kirstenbosch, although the trustees of the National Botanic Gardens only officially resolved to create the herbarium four years later in 1939 after the Bolus herbarium had moved. The first annual budget of the herbarium was ¬£350 for salaries and equipment. Barker was appointed as head of the herbarium in 1940. By the time she retired the herbarium contained more than specimen sheets, everyone of which she had personally scrutinised. In 1956 the South African Museum herbarium, containing specimen sheets, was transferred to Kirstenbosch on permanent loan. In doing so the SA Museum herbarium curator, Dr Joyce Lewis and her assistant also transferred to Kirstenbosch. To accommodate them, Lewis was appointed Research Officer while Barker was appointed Curator, a position she held until her retirement in 1972. Barker was also an accomplished botanical illustrator. Thirty-five of her illustrations were published in Flowering Plants of South Africa between 1930 and 1938, and the Royal Horticultural Society in London had a set of her watercolour images of Agapanthus. The Compton Herbarium at Kirstenbosch held 107 colour images of Lachenalia painted by Barker between 1930 and 1950. Barker was also involved in the training of the Edward Muspratt Solly Scholars. Wachendorfia brachyandra W.F.Barker  Eponyms  Barker is commemorated in the names of several South African plants, including Leucadendron barkerae I. Williams, Haemanthus barkerae Snijman, Lachenalia barkeriana U. Mull.-Doblies, and Romulea barkerae M.P. de Vos. She described at least 50 species. Acrostemon barkerae Compton, Conophytum barkerae L. Bolus and Othonna barkerae Compton are named in her honour.

Sultan Husayn held prominent positions in the Imperial army and accompanied his grandfather on several of his military campaigns. He was executed by his uncle Shah Rukh during the war of succession following Timur's death. Birth and family Sultan Husayn was born in 1380, the son of Muhammad Beg of the Tayichiud tribe and his wife Aka Biki, also known as Taghay Shah (d.1382), a daughter of Timur. His paternal grandfather was Amir Musa, an influential noble and the uncle of the empress, Saray Mulk Khanum Military career Indian campaign Sultan Husayn was recorded as accompanying Timur to the Indian subcontinent during his war against the Delhi Sultanate in 1398. On 18 December, he led the left flank of the Timurid army in the Second Battle of Delhi against Mahmud Shah Tughlaq. Following a surprise assault against Mahmud Shah's advance guard, Sultan Husayn's cousin Pir Muhammad led a charge against the left wing of the Tughlaq army, whilst Sultan Husayn simultaneously attacked the right, pushing it back against the gates of the city. When an elephant-led charge against the Timurid centre was beaten back by volleys of arrows, the Tughlaq army was forced to retreat back into Delhi. On 20 December, the city surrendered to Timur. Ottoman and Levantine campaigns The following year, Timur declared war on the Mamluks of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, ruled by An-Nasir Faraj and Bayezid I respectively. When approaching the Mamluk city of Aleppo in October 1400, the emperor defeated the city's defenders during a battle in which Sultan Husayn led the vanguard of the left flank. However, by the time the Timurids moved on to lay siege to Damascus, soldiers in the army had begun to complain of weariness from the long campaign. Many started to desert to the enemy, including Sultan Husayn, who led a small band of followers to defect to the Egyptians on 30 December 1400. He was forced to change out of his Central Asian clothing and his pigtail, a style commonly worn among Timur's warriors, was cut off. He was captured following a sortie against the besiegers and brought before his grandfather, who ordered his feet be whipped as punishment for his betrayal. The wars culminated in the Battle of Ankara, fought against Bayezid I on 20 July 1402. Sultan Husayn was once more placed at the command of the vanguard of the left flank. Bayezid's Tatar cavalry switched sides to Timur during the battle, whilst Sultan Husayn forced the Ottoman right flank into retreat. These prompted Bayezid's son, S√ºleyman √áelebi, to flee the battlefield with his soldiers. Following the rout of the Ottoman infantry by the Timurid centre and the defeat of the Janissaries, Bayezid was captured and victory was declared by Timur. War of succession and death In the winter of 1404, Timur launched his invasion of Ming China, in what was to become his final campaign. Aware that the marches of Moghulistan, which lay between his empire and China, would need to be subjugated before any attack further east, Timur distributed his 200,000 strong force across the region. Sultan Husayn, commanding the left wing, was dispatched to Yasi while Khalil Sultan, commanding the right, was sent to Tashkent. Both grandsons were ordered to return with their men in the spring, while Timur himself continued on toward Beijing. He died however, on 18 February 1405, prior to ever reaching the Chinese border. News of the emperor's death quickly reached his family, who began marshalling their forces in preparation for the imminent power struggle. Sultan Husayn, aware that he could not count on the loyalty of all his soldiers, abandoned his army and broke away with a detachment of 1000 troops towards Samarqand. He hoped to take his grandfather's imperial capital by surprise and by capturing it, bolster his claim as Timur's successor. However, his cousin Khalil Sultan (who had declared himself emperor at Tashkent) reached the city first, claiming it alongside Timur's imperial treasury. Sultan Husayn, knowing that his claims were now hopeless, aligned himself with Khalil Sultan, who dispatched him at the head of a 30,000 strong army against Pir Muhammad, Timur's favoured successor. However, a noble named Pir 'AlI Taz convinced Sultan Husayn to abandon his cousin and reassert his own claim. Heeding this advice, he called an assembly of his nobles and immediately had two of them executed. The remaining number, in fear of their lives, swore their allegiance to Sultan Husayn, who then led his army against Samarqand. Khalil Sultan's troops went out to meet him and on July 1405, defeated Sultan Husayn and pursued him up to the city of Balkh, capturing his belongings and harem. Sultan Husayn took refuge with Sulayman Shah Dughlat, a nephew of Timur and a regional governor. While Khalil Sultan had no interest in pursuing his cousin further, Pir Muhammad insisted on his extradition. Sulayman Shah refused, and when Pir Muhammad sent an army against him in response, he and Sultan Husayn both fled to Timur's youngest son Shah Rukh, who ruled from Herat. Shah Rukh, deciding that Sulayman Shah should have surrendered the pretender on the first demand, had the latter imprisoned. Sultan Husayn was subsequently executed. The skin of his head, stuffed with grass, was sent to Pir Muhammad, while his body parts were displayed in the bazaars of Herat.

The film was released on May 13, 2019 on the official YouTube page of the rock band the National. The short is shot in black and white and features Vikander playing a woman from birth to death. The film features a medley of songs from the album of the same name by the band the National; however, the songs in the film differ from those in the album as Mills was brought in early in production and given permission to alter the songs as he saw fit. As the two projects developed concurrently, the final songs ended up differing from one another. The title for both the short film and the album of the same name was chosen by Mills from a lyric in the song of the same name. The song was originally titled Washington before Mills insisted on altering it. Synopsis Shot in black and white featuring 140 subtitles, the film is the biography of a woman from birth to death as she grows up, moves away from her family, falls in love, and creates a new family of her own. Production After finishing his film 20th Century Women, Mike Mills reached out to the band the National as he was interested in directing a music video for their album Sleep Well Beast. Instead the band responded by sending him fragments from their upcoming album encouraging Mills to use them as he saw fit. Mills was acquainted with actress Alicia Vikander who had trained as a ballet dancer and who had told him she wanted an opportunity to use her dance skills on film. When Mills conceived of the idea of making a biographical film on one woman's life from birth to death played by one actress he decided to use Vikander as her dance skills would help her embody the different ranges of motion necessary to portray the character. The film was shot in 2018 over 5 days. Release The movie premiered at a \\"Special Evening With the National\\" event at the Beacon Theater in New York on April 22, 2019. A Q&A; about the film followed moderated by Julien Baker featuring Mike Mills and two members of the National, Bryce Dessner, and Matt Berninger. Following was an audience Q&A; along with the live premier of the whole album along with a few prior released songs. It was subsequently released on YouTube on May 13, 2019. A version with director's commentary as well as a version with commentary by Berninger and Carin Besser; his wife; was also released along with their Q&A; at The Beacon on the same day within the description of said video.

She seems to have been captured in Africa and sold on as a slave in England before English slave-trading with Africa was fully established. She is noted as one of the first recorded black people in England, and among those whose lives are most fully recorded. Life In 1647, a maid born outside England, 'Dinah the Black', who has been thought to be the same person, visited the Baptist spiritualist Sarah Wight in London and asked her advice.Imtiaz Habib, Black Lives in the English Archives, 1500‚Äì1677: Imprints of the Invisible (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , pp. 210-11. 'I am often tempted against my life: I am not as others are, I do not look so as others do,' she explained.Henry Jessey, The Exceeding Riches of Grace Advanced by the Spirit of Grace, in An Empty Nothing Creature, viz. Mrs Sarah Wight, 7th ed. (London: Mortlock, 1658). In 1667, Dinah had been working as a servant to Dorothy Smith in Bristol for five years. She was put on a ship to be transported to a plantation (presumably in the West Indies), but managed to escape. She took her case to the Bristol Court of Aldermen in July 1667, and, since Dorothy Smith did not wish to take her back, the aldermen judged that she should be free to earn her living until the next Quarter sessions.John Latimer, The Annals of Bristol in the Seventeenth Century (Bristol: William George's Sons, 1900). It is not known what happened to her after this. Reception Dinah's story has been described as 'the most revealing of Bristol's black records'.Imtiaz Habib, Black Lives in the English Archives, 1500‚Äì1677: Imprints of the Invisible (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 209. She was included in the 2018 book The Women Who Built Bristol,Jane Duffus, The Women Who Built Bristol (Bristol: Tangent Books, 2018). and her imagined life story has been included on a BBC Black History Month website.

Unlike Street plays, Mobile Theatre groups travel from place to place with their cast, singers, musicians, dancers and crew, often carrying tents and seating with them.  History  The Kohinoor Opera was the first mobile theatre group of Assam, founded by Natyacharya Brajanath Sarma, in 1930. Kohinoor Opera performed dramas, attracting thousands of spectators, from Dhubri to Sadiya. The first Mobile Theatre play was staged on 2 October 1963, in Pathsala. Achyut Lahkar is known as the father of Mobile Theatre. Lahkar's group, the Pathsala-based Nataraj Cine Theatre, was popular during the early years. His productions included: Bhogjora, Tikendrajit, Black Money, Beula. Lahkar took Mobile Theatres to Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh. They collaborated with artists from multiple states. An industry with an annual turnover of around 100 million, the Mobile Theatre of Assam provide a source of entertainment that has progressively upgraded its stature.  Form  The Mobile Theatre of Assam has things in common with the Jatra of West Bengal, e.g. the performance on makeshift stages and are mobile. The Mobile Theatre is more advanced technically and evolved from mythological stories, to contemporary themes. The self-contained nature of Mobile Theatre allows performances in small villages without their own performance spaces, which was particularly important in villages without electricity for television. Troupes offer plays including adaptations of popular Assamese novels, Greek Classics and Hollywood blockbusters. There are over 30 mobile theatre groups in Assam, most of them based in Pathsala. In mid-September, after two months of rehearsals, the groups begin their seven-month tour in Assam.  Special effects  In 2008 Kohinoor Theatre staged Abuj Dora, Achin Kanya, the tale of a dwarf and his two friends of normal size. Jatin Bora played three roles. In one he was transformed in a dwarf. From lighting effects to specially tailored clothes and help from technicians, the producers were able to preserve the illusion. A local version of Superman was put on by Ashirbad Theatre. The protagonist flew around the stage with powers provided by his costume. In Deboraj Theatre's play, the role of a Dracula inspired Vampire appeared on stage. The group brought to life the blood sucking scenes in the play with technical help.  Dance drama  Some theatre groups precede the main play with a short Nritya Natika or dance drama (‡¶®‡ßÉ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶Ø-‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶ï‡¶æ) which is mostly dance based. Here dialogues are recited from background and the artists are supposed to mime it accordingly.

Origin The Gull Dong is the result from when a Gull Terrier is crossbred with a Bully Kutta. These started to be crossed in colonial India and the consequent Gull Dong is celebrated in India and Pakistan for its \\"speed and tenacity\\". During the era of the British Raj in India, Bull Terriers were introduced to the northwest Indian subcontinent, which now includes the modern republics of India and Pakistan. In British India, the Bull Terrier breed soared in popularity, with the Bull Terrier Club of India being established in Calcutta. Bull Terriers were crossed with local breeds to develop the Gull Terrier, often called the Indian Bull Terrier and also now the Pakistani Bull Terrier.

Strong (1864‚Äì1950) was a philanthropist who funded the building of hospitals, educational institutions, and social service agencies throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States. She was awarded the French Legion of Honor after establishing in 1927 a retreat near Paris for soldiers wounded during World War I.  Personal life  Hattie Marie Corrin was born on October 23, 1864, in South Coventry, Connecticut. She and her family enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle, until the business recession of 1877 and the subsequent death of her father a few years later. After that, her family had to move in with their relatives and she began offering piano lessons as a way of earning income. In 1888 she married Lester B. Lockwood and moved with him to Tacoma. She gave birth to her only child, Lester Corrin, in 1892. In 1897 she divorced Lockwood after he had abandoned her. She was left with limited financial resources. During the Klondike Gold Rush, Strong travelled with her son and a friend, who was a nurse, to establish a hospital for sick and injured miners. The ship they were on, carrying construction and medical supplies, wrecked. While stranded in Skagway, Strong worked as a nurse before moving to Southern California. She married Henry A. Strong, co-founder and first president of Kodak Eastman in 1905.  Buildings funded  Beginning in 1908‚Äì1909, with the funding of the Strong Academy at Shiloh Orphanage in Augusta, Georgia, Strong's philanthropy focused heavily on funding buildings. Strong funded the construction of buildings around the world at educational and medical institutions and many are named after her‚Äîeither using her married name of Strong or her maiden name of Corrin‚Äîat Peking University in China, Rollins College in Florida, the University of Rochester in New York, George Washington University in Washington D.C., and Salem College in North Carolina. She also funded the YWCAs in Rochester and Washington D.C. The Hattie M. Strong Residence Hall at George Washington University is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The hall was the first women‚Äôs residence hall built on the campus. Strong gained the name ‚ÄúMother Strong‚Äù through her relationship and philanthropy with Rollins College in Winter Park, FL. Strong Hall at Rollins College was completed in 1939 at Rollins and was slated for a complete renovation in 2018. At Salem College, Strong funded the Corrin Refectory and the Strong Honors House, which is available for first-year students and upper-class students in the honors program. The dormitory building houses up to 34 students in double rooms in the two-story building. It was designed to Strong's specifications to include living quarters for her on the first floor, where she lived until her death.  Legacy  The Hattie M. Strong Foundation began running a student loan program in 1928. Loans are zero interest and offer flexible repayment schedules that can be adjusted to students‚Äô economic needs. In 2009, the foundation began a scholarship program instead of a loan program. The program is specifically aimed toward students pursuing a teacher‚Äôs licensure and is currently available to students attending twenty-four colleges and universities in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Washington, D.C. The scholarships are offered to students during the semester that they are conducting student teaching, in order to reduce the financial strain of full-time teaching while still students. Her official papers are collected at the Salem College library and archives in Winston- Salem, N.C. The Hattie Strong Collection includes items such as photographs, scrapbooks, diaries, and personal correspondence. The items are a cumulation of items already held by Salem College and items donated by the Hattie Strong Foundation.  Death  Strong died in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in 1950.

She studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1925. The art historian Patricia Allmer has described her as 'one of the international figures of surrealism and its developments in the 1940s.'  Career  Reacting against what she saw as the conformity of life in Britain, between World War I and World War II Yarrow lived, worked and exhibited in Paris. During her time in Paris, Yarrow associated with many surrealist artists, including Leonora Carrington, Isamu Noguchi, Marcel Duchamp and Max Ernst. Her entry into this milieu was provided by an early acquaintance with the poet Pierre Reverdy. She also formed an important relationship with Alberto Giacometti. Yarrow studied etching at Atelier 17, a workshop established in Paris by Stanley William Hayter, an English printmaker, in 1929. This resulted in a number of prints characterized by surrealist and biomorphic forms. In the 1930s, Yarrow was also apprenticed to the potter Josep Llorens i Artigas. Yarrow later discussed the importance of pottery in the development of her career: 'It wasn't until I came to the pottery that I had any craft. And that's why it was extremely important for me in the early thirties. [...] It absolutely changed by life - this pottery, this occupation and the craft.' In the 1930s Yarrow suffered an emotional breakdown and spent time in Switzerland, where she met Carl Jung, and entered a clinic in Morges where she underwent analysis. Yarrow's experience of undergoing Jungian therapy resulted in a series of watercolours, many of which feature menacing, brightly-coloured geometric personages, and some of which specifically reference Morges in their titles. Together with many other Surrealist artists fleeing the war, in 1940 Yarrow moved to New York, where she lived until 1948. Yarrow's move to New York was prompted in part by Hayter's relocation of Atelier 17 to the city in 1940, and she continued to associate there with surrealists in exile such as Ernst, Carrington and Andr√© Breton. In New York, Yarrow's straightened financial circumstances prompted her to start experimenting with making leather goods; these enabled her to make a living. During this period, Yarrow became an acquaintance of the artist Louise Bourgeois. In an interview with Hans Ulrich Obrist, Bourgeois noted that the title of her sculpture Portrait of C.Y. (c. 1947-49), made of painted wood and nails, was a reference to Yarrow. After her years in New York, Yarrow returned to Britain, where she focused increasingly on ceramics and pottery, establishing a workshop/studio that included an oil-fired kiln in the garden of her mews cottage in St John's Wood. With fellow St John's Wood resident Buntie Wills, a Jungian therapist, Yarrow undertook further Jungian analysis. The 1950s and 1960s saw her experience a period of creativity, producing a diverse array of work in using mono print and pastels, as well as mixed materials such as sand. Associates during this later period of her career included the potter, founder and co- editor of the magazine Ceramic Review Eileen Lewenstein. From the mid-1960s onwards, Yarrow also took up painting.  Exhibition History  While in America, Yarrow's ceramics were exhibited at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1943, together with drawings by Ernst. In 1943, her work featured in The Women's Exhibition organised by Peggy Guggenheim at her Art of this Century gallery, New York, a follow-up to the Exhibition by 31 Women at the beginning of the year. In 1944 Yarrow was included in the exhibition New Directions in Gravure: Hayter and Studio 17 at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, which traveled for two years across the United States. In 1950 Yarrow had an exhibition at the Hanover Gallery in London. During the 1960s she exhibited her ceramics together with artists including Bernard Leach and Lucie Rie at the Marjorie Parr Gallery, London. In 2012 an exhibition of her prints, drawings and watercolours at Austin Desmond Gallery, London, attracted serious interest from collectors. In 2017, a pen and ink drawing by Yarrow was included in the exhibition 31 Women by Breese Little gallery, an homage to Guggenheim's 1943 exhibition of women surrealists. In 2018, Yarrow's ceramics featured in the Collect 2018 exhibition Masters of Studio Pottery, co-curated by the Crafts Council and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. The same year, her watercolours were included in the exhibition Neolithic Childhood: Art in a False Present, c. 1930 at the Haus der Kulturen der Welt.

He implemented, evaluated and refined such designs in the Rice Institute Computer, R1 (1958‚Äì61) and the ICL Basic Language Machine (1963‚Äì68). A key feature in the architectures of both machines was control by the hardware of the formation and use of memory references so that the memory could be seen as a collection of data objects of defined sizes whose integrity is protected from the consequences of errors in address calculation, such as overrunning memory pointers (whether by accident or malicious intent).  Technical contributions  Iliffe attended the EDSAC programming course in Cambridge in 1952. He eventually learned about computing by running the IBM(UK) service bureau in London. In 1958 he was invited to join the team building the R1 computer at Rice Institute, Houston, in which he took responsibility for operating system and language design and implementation. In the next 30 years he put into operation four computers demonstrating and evaluating new concepts in design.  The Rice R1 Computer  Iliffe led the development of the operating system and programming language for the Rice Computer. His design included an early instance of dynamic memory allocation and management, enabling programs to acquire storage on demand and automatically recover it when it was no longer accessible. In the R1 (mostly written in [or before] 1994, and archived by the Wayback Machine on a date indicated [by \\"20080224\\"] in the URL) Iliffe and his colleagues introduced a protection scheme for all data objects. The manipulation of references to memory (termed codewords) was restricted to privileged code, preventing some types of program error. Codewords referenced vectors of data items, sequences of instructions or other codewords . Storage was accessed by reference to a codeword and this was resolved to a conventional address or program counter giving direct access to store when necessary. The system provided functions to create, manage and update codewords, for example changing them to reflect storage management decisions. It also supported an algebraic programming language (called Genie) which was implemented using object-oriented design concepts in 1961. The Genie compiler and associated assembler were unusual in enabling the entire system to be treated as an object-management discipline. Genie was also amongst the first languages to include intrinsic operations on real and complex vectors and matrices. The well-known Iliffe vector storage structure for multi- dimensional and irregular arrays emerged from the R1 work. It exploits a similar addressing structure but without system enforcement. The Iliffe vector storage structure has been adopted widely for use in application programs and high-level language systems.  The Basic Language Machine  In the early 1960s there was a strong requirement for general-purpose computers to provide for the concurrent execution of multiple user programs, both in the form of multiprogramming to optimise the use of a computer's resources and in the form of time-sharing to enable interactive computing. Both of these require a computer architecture in which the operating system could guarantee the separation, security and integrity of several concurrently-running programs. It seemed clear that the simplified model of architecture derived from the Princeton IAS and followed by all the ‚Äúvon Neumann‚Äù models would run into severe difficulties in satisfying that requirement. The Basic Language Machine (BLM), constructed and evaluated in the research department of International Computers Limited (ICL) between 1963 and 1968 was the first general-purpose system to break completely with the Von Neumann architecture. Instead of basing the architecture on a single linear address space, the BLM offered segmented memory addressing, enabling automatic storage management and access within precise security boundaries. Iliffe took the engineering view that it should be possible to offer a way, based on the memory management techniques already demonstrated in the Rice R1 to ensure the integrity of concurrent programs without resorting to relatively expensive mechanisms involving the frequent swapping of process state vectors seen in most other systems. He developed a design based on the use of codewords to represent all memory references. A codeword included a base address, a limit specifying the length of a data object and some type information. The internal representation of codewords was opaque to user programs but specific machine instructions were provided to manipulate them in ways that maintained the data structure.That represented a substantial refinement of the Rice R1 architecture, providing for the efficient management of multiple processes, each having a separate tree-structured data and instruction store. The Rice R1 and the BLM were examples of descriptor-based computer architectures that emerged in the 1960s Chapter 2 Early Descriptor Architectures, Chapter 3 Early Capability Architectures aimed both at the efficient protection of concurrently-executing programs and the reliable implementation of high-level languages. The other major example was the B5000 series of computers developed and marketed by the Burroughs Corporation. All these descriptor-based computers included hardware mechanisms designed to support the reliable addressing of data segments. They are closely related to capability-based architectures that emerged a few years later. In parallel with construction of the BLM a separate evaluation team assessed it in terms of (1) program efficiency (2) operating characteristics (3) coding and debugging costs and (4) system overheads. For meaningful comparison, legacy high-level languages (Cobol, Fortran, file management) were used. It was shown that despite the precision of the addressing mechanism there was no noticeable loss of efficiency or additional system overhead. Levy discusses the wider impact of descriptor-based computer architectures with reference to both the Burroughs B5000 and the BLM (p. 38) \\"... whether or not they were long-lived, these machines demonstrated the feasibility of using descriptors and segmentation to greatly increase programming flexibility for the user, the compilers, and the operating system\\". Levy also notes that \\"an excellent discussion of the BLM within the context of modern capability systems appears in Iliffe's Advanced Computer Design\\". The BLM design was rejected by ICL management in an internal review of options to select a new architecture for ICL's mainframe products in December 1969. In the year 2000 Iliffe received the IEEE Harry H. Goode Memorial Award \\"For lifetime achievement in the practice of computer system design and evaluation.\\" Changes in semiconductor technology in the 30 years following the development of the BLM led to refinements of the architecture. In the absence of research funding they were evaluated mainly by simulation using low-cost microprocessors and Iliffe's Advanced Computer Design describes them in some detail.

Life  Aslaug Sverdrup S√∏mme was born in 1891 in Bergen. Her father was Jakob Sverdrup, a bishop and politician, and her mother was Marie Bernardine Suur. In 1910, S√∏mme enrolled at the University of Oslo's Institute for Genetic Research (Institut for Arvelighetsforskning) in Oslo, Norway. In 1918, she started a master's degree in zoology, studying plankton in the Oslofjord from the research station in Dr√∏bak. During her degree, she was supervised by Kristine Bonnevie, the first female professor in Norway. From this research, S√∏mme published the study 'Plankton surveys from Kristianiafjorden. Hydromeduser' in 1921. By 1919 was appointed as an assistant professor (amanuensis), becoming only the second women ever to hold a research position at the university. S√∏mme and Bonnevie published studies on polydactyly ('Postaxial polydactylism in six generations of a Norwegian family' in 1922), and twins ('Hereditary predisposition to dizygotic twin- births in Norwegian peasant families' in 1926). Upon hearing of the growing work being done by William Bateson on genetics at the John Innes Horticultural Institute (now the John Innes Centre) in the UK, S√∏mme wrote to Bateson requesting to join him working on Primula sinensis, crossing the North Sea in 1921, initially as a volunteer. During her time working in the 'Ladies Lab' with other female geneticists including Caroline Pellew and Dorothea De Winton, S√∏mme studied Primula sinensis genetics and cytology. The research she conducted at the John Innes Horticultural Institute formed part of her doctoral dissertation, which was finished in 1931. S√∏mme remained in England until 1926, at which point she returned to Norway to take up the position of lecturer in genetics at the University of Oslo. The research she conducted at the John Innes Horticultural Institute formed part of her doctoral dissertation, which was finished in 1931. In 1929, Sverdrup married Iacob Dybwad S√∏mme, who she had met in 1925 in Dr√∏bak. Together they had one son, Lauritz S. S√∏mme, who was born in 1931. In 1942, Iacob Dybwad S√∏mme was arrested for his participation in the Norwegian resistance movement to the Nazi occupiers. He was sentenced to death in 1944. Following the arrest of Otto Lous Mohr, director of the institute at the time, by the Nazis in 1941, S√∏mme took charge of the board for the Institute of Genetic Research at the University of Oslo. She took over this position again in 1945 when Mohr became the rector of the university in 1945. S√∏mme resigned from her post at the University of Oslo in 1950 and died in 1955.

The film had musical score by Srikanth Deva and was released on 6 November 2009. Plot Venkat (Prithvi Rajan) is a studious college student and son of the poor widow Parvathi (Pallavi). He stays in a hostel in the city with his classmates (Thadi Balaji and Kadhal Sukumar). Venkat is madly in love with his college mate Kavitha (Madhuchanda), daughter of the rich landlord Pannaiyar (Kadhal Dhandapani), for two years. When Venkat declares his love to her, Kavitha, who absolutely detests the very thought of a young boy and girl falling in love, humiliates and insults him. She keeps avoiding Venkat, but he tries different ways to impress Kavitha. Kavitha then falls in love with him and accepts his love. After finishing their studies, the two lovers return to their respective village. One day, Parvathi witnesses them romancing in the ricefield and warns them about the danger of being in love. In the past, Parvathi's brother Vettaikaaran (Gemini Raghava) worked in Pannaiyar's house. The village belle Vaidehi (Karthika Adaikalam), Pannaiyar's daughter, then declared her love to the naive Vettaikaaran, but Vettaikaaran could not believe her, and Vaidehi fainted. Vettaikaaran ran off in a panic with Vaidehi in his arms, and Pannaiyar stopped him and beat him up. Later, Vettaikaaran accepted her love, and Vaidehi made her brother accept for the wedding. When Vettaikaaran, Parvathi, and her husband Pazhani (Benjamin) came to ask Vaidehi in marriage in Pannaiyar's home, Pannaiyar, who was hell-bent to save his family's prestige at any cost, murdered Vaidehi and Pazhani. Pannaiyar then blamed Vettaikaaran for killing them, and Vettaikaaran went to jail. Back to the present, Venkat and Kavitha decide to elope. Pannaiyar and his henchmen then catch them and hang them on a tree, but Vettaikaaran comes to their rescue and saves them.

He was then released to join Western League club Salisbury, where he spent eight years, helping them earn election to the Southern League in 1968 and playing more than 300 matches. He returned to Kent, playing occasionally for Margate's reserves and finally, in 1981 at the age of 36, made his first-team debut for the club, playing at right back for the last 20 matches of the 1980‚Äì81 Southern League Southern Division season. He later managed Ramsgate and served on the committee of the Margate club in its Thanet United era.

He was born in C√°diz in 1741 and died in 1806.Morgado Garc√≠a, Arturo, \\"Sobre la figura de Cayetano Huarte\\", Iglesia e Ilustraci√≥n en el C√°diz del siglo XVIII: Cayetano Huarte (1741‚Äì1806), Cadiz, University, 1991. Biography Son of perpetual alderman Juan Antonio de Huarte and brother of Francisco de Huarte, one of the contributors to the foundation of the Academy of Fine Arts of C√°diz, Cayetano was born in 1741. After receiving a doctorate in Theology from the University of Osuna he joined a cathedral chapter in 1773. He was subsequently named director of the College of Santa Cruz, which was founded with the aim of serving as the talent pool for the cathedral choir. He visited the town of Vejer de la Frontera after evidence appeared suggesting that Saint Cervantes and Saint Germain passed through the town on their way to Tangier to receive martyrs' palms. He was a member of the governing board at the C√°diz Hospice where he became the spiritual director. He insisted that the dowries granted by the patronages of pious works administered by the chapter benefited the poor. In 1786 he called for his fellow chapter clerics to assist in buying quinine to treat yellow fever. His efforts ensured that the prebendaries increased the finance allocated to the hospice. Named canon penitentiary in 1788, his precarious health required him to spend many years residing in the town of Lanjaron in the Province of Granada so that he could benefit from the local spring water. By 1797 his activities had returned to their previous rhythm, with the chapter entrusting him with important missions. He went to Seville to present the accounts of the patronages of pious works to the Audiencia Provincial and led the protests of the prebendaries during the Spanish confiscation in 1798. He then organised a series of pastoral visits for the dioceses, the reports of which are first hand sources, giving us an insight into spiritual life at the end of the 18th century. It appears that he died suddenly, leaving no will, in 1806. According to Ravina Mar√≠n,Ravina Mart√≠n, Manuel, \\"Don Rafael de Ant√∫nez y sus Memorias hist√≥ricas sobre la legislaci√≥n y gobierno del comercio\\", La Burgues√≠a de Negocios en la Andaluc√≠a de la Ilustraci√≥n, volume 2, C√°diz, Diputaci√≥n, 1991. Huarte belonged to a group of erudite figures from C√°diz, which included his brother Francisco, Antonio Mosti, Rafael de Ant√∫nez, Gaspar de Molina y Zald√≠var, the marquis of Ure√±a and the marquis of M√©ritos. Cayetano must have been on good terms with them since he presided over the marriage of Ant√∫nez and delivered the sermon during the ceremony in which one of Mosti's daughters became a nun. He was not the only ecclesiastic from C√°diz to share in these ideals, notable among them were ecclesiastical colleague Antonio Trianes and magisterial colleague Antonio Cabrera, though both would concentrate on their own endeavours during the first part of the 19th century. List of works The majority of Huarte's works remain unpublished to this day, they consist of three main bodies: # Sermons, almost all published in the 18th century. # Historical criticism, represented by the Discurso sobre los santos del Obispado de C√°diz [Discourse on the Saints of the Diocese of Cadiz], it was read before members of the chapter in 1802. It attempted to demonstrate that the devotion given to various saints considered part of the diocese was not appropriate from a historical standpoint. # Finally, his poetic vein remains captured in Poes√≠as in√©ditas del Sr. Dn. Cayetano Mar√≠a de Huarte can√≥nigo penitenciario de esta Santa Iglesia Catedral de C√°diz [Unpublished Poems of Se√±or Don Cayetano Mar√≠a de Huarte Canon Penitentiary of the Holy Cathedral of C√°diz]. A manuscript with calligraphy from the start of the 19th century is preserved in the Biblioteca Municipal de C√°diz Cadiz Public Library] , two typed copies can be found within the Biblioteca de Temas Gaditanos [Library of Topics from Cadiz]. None of his poems, apart from La Duc√≠ada printed by the Marquis of M√©ritos in 1807, saw the light of day until their publication in 1991 in the book Iglesia e Ilustraci√≥n en el C√°diz del siglo XVIII: Cayetano Huarte [Church and Illustration in C√°diz in the 18th century: Cayetano Huarte]. The following is a list of the compositions included in this manuscript: *La Duc√≠ada. *√âgloga en elogio de Andaluc√≠a (1772) [Eclogue in Praise of Andalucia]. *Versi√≥n del c√°ntico de Mois√©s (1797?) [Version of Moses' Canticle]. *Silvano a su hijo que iba voluntario de campa√±a (1795) [Silvano to her Son who Voluntarily went to the Campaign]. *Soneto con motivo de la guerra contra Francia (1793-17955?) [Sonnet on the Occasion of War against France]. *Soneto con motivo del decreto que proh√≠be la ‚ÄúLiga de la Teolog√≠a Moderna con la Filosof√≠a\\" y \\"El p√°jaro en la Liga\\" (1799?) [Sonnet on the Occasion of the Decree Banning the ‚ÄúLeague of Modern Technology with Philosophy‚Äù] and [The Bird in the League]. *Soneto con motivo de los esc√°ndalos cometidos en la iglesia del P√≤pulo en Cuaresma (1793). [Sonnet on the Occasion of the Scandals Committed in the Church of P√≤pulo during Lent]. *Soneto a Mar√≠a Amparo Aguirre. [Sonnet to Mar√≠a Amparo Aguirre]. *Anacre√≥ntica a Antero Benito N√∫√±ez (1794). [Anacreontic to Antero Benito N√∫√±ez]. *A Antero Benito N√∫√±ez por la muerte de un amigo com√∫n. [To Antero Benito N√∫√±ez after the death of a mutual friend]. *Llanto de Delio por su patria C√°diz. [Delio's cry for his homeland C√°diz]. *A Gelmira al haberse quemado los dedos (1793). [To Gelmira after having burned his fingers]. *Sue√±o de Delio Albana. [Delio's dream for Albana] In this poem Huarte refers to the adoption of an African girl by the Duchess of Alba, a theme that is also reflected in a poem by Manuel Jos√© Quintana. *F√°bula primera. La retama y el romero (1797). [First fable.The Retama and the Rosemary]. *F√°bula segunda. Las abejas (1798) [Second fable. The Bees]. *F√°bula tercera. El vaquero [Third fable. The Cowboy]. *S√°tira primera. El familiar del obispo. [First Satire. The Bishop's Relative]. *S√°tira segunda. Contra las diversiones de corridas de toros. [Second Satire. Against the Spectacle of Bullfighting]. *S√°tira tercera. Contra los errores en las doctrinas morales y devociones falsas y supersticiosas. [Third Satire. Against Errors in Moral Doctrines and False Devotions and Superstitions]. *S√°tira cuarta. A la obra del ex jesuita Bonola \\"Liga de la Teolog√≠a Moderna con la Filosof√≠a\\" (1798?). [Fourth Satire. To the work of ex-jesuit Bonola ‚ÄúUnion of Modern Theology with Philosophy‚Äù]. *S√°tira quinta. Himno a la Giralda. [Fifth Satire. Hymn to the Giralda]. *F√°bula dicha por una ni√±a del Hospicio (1800). [Fable told by a Girl from the Hospice]. *Lastly, the hilarious satirical letters on the tragedy of Sancho Ortiz de la Roelas (1800), which were written as a response to said work and also as an interpretation of La estrella de Sevilla [The Star of Seville] by Lope de Vega performed by Candido Maria Trigueros, one of the principal adapters of 18th century theatre during the Spanish Golden Age. It is very possible that Huarte was influenced by the Literary School of Salamanca as in some poems he uses the alias ‚ÄúDelio‚Äù which was used and originally created by Fray Diego Gonz√°lez. In addition he writes using anacreontic verses, a style which was favoured by Mel√©ndez Vald√©s, as well as the use of themes distinctive to Quintana poetry, such as those seen in Sue√±o de Delio Albana [Delio's Dream for Albana]. It would also be interesting to establish the possible (or certain) connections between Huarte and the members of the Sevillian Literary School, such as Arjona, Manuel Mar√≠a del M√°rmol, Reinoso, Blanco White or Lista, but there is no documentation to prove it. Huarte's clerical status was by no means exceptional in late 18th century Spanish poetry: Fray Diego Gonz√°lez, from the Literary School of Salamanca and many of the leading representatives from the School of Seville were also ecclesiastical. A recurring theme in Huarte's poetry is his love for his small hometown Cadiz, as can be seen in the verses of his work Llanto de Delio por su patria C√°diz [Delio's lament for his homeland Cadiz], written after the British Royal Navy attacked the city in 1797. One can also readily appreciate Huarte's various philanthropic concerns such as those in Sue√±o de Delio y Albana [Delio's Dream for Albana], where the anti-slavery sentiments that began to penetrate Spain towards the end of the 18th century are echoed, condemning the atrocities practiced by various European nations towards the African people; and F√°bula dicha por una ni√±a del Hospicio [Fable told by a Girl from the Orphanage] in which he urges the orphanage's board of directors to continue with their care efforts. A social and moral criticism is also very present in his second satirical work: Contra las diversiones en las corridas de toros [Against the Spectacle of Bullfighting]. It is interesting to note the position of the canon with regard to the war against the French National Convention (1793‚Äì1795) as in contrast to the rest of the country who enthusiastically welcomed the conflict of a new war on religion, Huarte continually expressed his rejection of these attitudes. In Silvano a su hijo que iba voluntario de campa√±a, [Silvano to his Son who Voluntarily went to the Campaign], a poem written in 1795, Huarte displayed his condemnation of the alleged ‚Äúwar on religion‚Äù, saying that it was fanaticism that ‚Äúinvented that voice, unknown in the purest age of Christianity‚Äù. He also condemned the war against France in his work Anacre√≥ntica a Don Antero Benito N√∫√±ez [Anacreontic to Don Antero Benito N√∫√±ez], written a year prior. Huarte's work does not lack criticism of the ecclesiastical establishment and its vices and small hardships, which surfaced in the hilarious satirical piece El familiar del Obispo [The Bishop's Relative], perhaps one his best poetic works. The bishop's fury over not achieving a longed-for canonry leads him to show off his alleged merits by charming the vicar's nieces, offering them promises of marriage that he never intended to keep, performing jobs without being fully prepared, faithfully serving the prelate whilst neglecting his intellectual training, as well as nepotism, ignorance and servility. According to these verses, these were all characteristics present in the Church during late 18th century. Nevertheless, Huarte reserved his sharpest satirical remarks for ideas on probabilism, which led him to completely reject the Company and everything it entails, attributing to it a good part of the evils that afflicted the church. In his third satire Contra los errores en las doctrinas morales y devociones falsas y supersticiosas [Against Errors in Moral Doctrines and False and Superstitious Devotions] he mercilessly condemns the laxity of theologians and confessors as well as the anti-Augustinian opinions of some Jesuits, and the mental laziness of theologians in general. He returns to these issues in his fourth satire: A la obra del ex jesuita Bonola, Liga de la Teolog√≠a Moderna con la Filosof√≠a, en da√±o de la Religi√≥n de Nuestro Se√±or Jesucristo [To the work by ex-Jesuit Bonola, Union of Modern Theology with Philosophy, Damaging the Religion of Our Lord Jesus Christ]. Various features of this author's work allow him to be included in the Jansenist movement that spread through Spain in the last years of the 18th century. These include his biblical and patristic culture, his rejection of superstitions and legends without historical foundation, his critical spirit, rejection of probabilism and laxity, which he identifies as Jesuit doctrines, his moral rigorism, and his love for the primitive Church. His philosophy displays the vitality, the cultural openness and the desire for intellectual renewal of the best works in Cadiz at the time.

Signs and symptoms Symptoms include aural fullness, ears popping, a feeling of pressure in the affected ear(s), a feeling that the affected ear(s) is clogged, crackling, ear pain, tinnitus, autophony, and muffled hearing. Diagnosis While Eustachian tube dysfunction can be hard to diagnose, due to the Eustachian tubes and the nasopharynx not being easily visible, usually a tympanometry is indicated, along with findings on an otoscopy. For cases of baro-challenge induced Eustachian tube dysfunction, diagnosis usually relies on the history of the patient and their reported symptoms, as otoscopy and tympanometry is sometimes normal at normal ambient pressure. Types Three subtypes have been described: #Dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction: Functional, dynamic (muscle failure), or anatomical obstruction of the Eustachian tube #Baro-challenge induced Eustachian tube dysfunction: Eustachian tube dysfunction which generally features a normal otoscopy and normal tympanometry #Patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction Causes Eustachian tube dysfunction can be caused by a number of factors. Some common causes include the flu, allergies, a cold, and sinus infections. Treatment First-line treatment options are generally aimed at treating the underlying cause and include attempting to \\"pop\\" the ears, usually via the Valsalva maneuver, the use of oral or topical decongestants, oral steroids, oral antihistamines, and topical nasal steroid sprays, such as Flonase. If medical management fails, myringotomy, which is a surgical procedure in which an incision is made in the eardrum to drain pus from the middle ear or to relieve pressure caused by a large buildup of fluid, is indicated, and usually accompanied by the insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Tentative evidence supports the use of balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube. No high quality studies, however, have been done as of 2018.

Research contributions Given an almost Hermitian manifold, a totally real submanifold is one for which the tangent space is orthogonal to its image under the almost complex structure. From the algebraic structure of the Gauss equation and the Simons formula, Chen and Koichi Ogiue derived a number of information on submanifolds of complex space forms which are totally real and minimal. By using Shiing- Shen Chern, Manfredo do Carmo, and Shoshichi Kobayashi's estimate of the algebraic terms in the Simons formula, Chen and Ogiue showed that closed submanifolds which are totally real and minimal must be totally geodesic if the second fundamental form is sufficiently small.S.S. Chern, M. do Carmo, and S. Kobayashi. Minimal submanifolds of a sphere with second fundamental form of constant length. 1970 Functional Analysis and Related Fields (Proc. Conf. for M. Stone, Univ. Chicago, Chicago, Ill., 1968) pp. 59‚Äì75 Springer, New York By using the Codazzi equation and isothermal coordinates, they also obtained rigidity results on two-dimensional closed submanifolds of complex space forms which are totally real. In 1993, Chen studied submanifolds of space forms, showing that the intrinsic sectional curvature at any point is bounded below in terms of the intrinsic scalar curvature, the length of the mean curvature vector, and the curvature of the space form. In particular, as a consequence of the Gauss equation, given a minimal submanifold of Euclidean space, every sectional curvature at a point is greater than or equal to one-half of the scalar curvature at that point. Interestingly, the submanifolds for which the inequality is an equality can be characterized as certain products of minimal surfaces of low dimension with Euclidean spaces. Chen introduced and systematically studied the notion of a finite type submanifold of Euclidean space, which is a submanifold for which the position vector is a finite linear combination of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. He also introduced and studied a generalization of the class of totally real submanifolds and of complex submanifolds; a slant submanifold of an almost Hermitian manifold is a submanifold for which there is a number such that the image under the almost complex structure of an arbitrary submanifold tangent vector has an angle of with the submanifold's tangent space. In Riemannian geometry, Chen introduced the Œ¥-invariants (also called Chen invariants), which are certain kinds of partial traces of the sectional curvature; they can be viewed as an interpolation between sectional curvature and scalar curvature. Due to the Gauss equation, the Œ¥-invariants of a Riemannian submanifold can be controlled by the length of the mean curvature vector and the size of the sectional curvature of the ambient manifold. Submanifolds of space forms which satisfy the equality case of this inequality are known as ideal immersions; such submanifolds are critical points of a certain restriction of the Willmore energy.

History  The PC series of bombs differed from the SC series because they had thick cases for enhanced penetration of armored targets like warships or reinforced concrete fortifications. While the SD series bombs could be used in a semi-armor piercing role the PC series of bombs were specifically designed as armor-piercing bombs. Since they had thicker hardened steel cases their charge to weight ratio was only 20% of their total weight. Bombs in the PC series included the PC 500, PC 1000, PC 1400, and PC 1600. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The smaller bombs had either Amatol or TNT while the larger bombs were filled more powerful explosives like RDX and Trialen to compensate for their reduced charges. The PC series of bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments. The PC series served as a base for the later PC RS series rocket propelled bombs which were designed to enhance penetration by increasing their terminal velocity.  Design  The body was of one-piece forged steel construction which was filled through the base with either Amatol or TNT and was fitted with either a sheet steel or magnesium alloy 4 finned tail with a cylindrical strut. There was a single transverse fuze pocket near the base of the bomb. The PC 500 was horizontally suspended by a T-Type suspension lug in a bomb bay or fuselage hardpoint. The bombs were painted dark grey with a dark blue stripe on the tail. There were two variants of the PC 500 series: * D500E - This version was the heavier of the two, it was shorter, had a thicker diameter, was thicker cased, and had a charge to weight ratio of 14%. * D500L - This version was the lighter of the two, it was longer, had a smaller diameter, was thinner cased, was thicker nosed and had a charge to weight ratio of 19%.

It was Hartman's first recording since 1967 and marked a new phase in his career, with the inclusion of material by more contemporary songwriters such as Jimmy Webb, Kris Kristofferson, and Paul Williams. Musicians on the album include well-known jazz instrumentalists such as George Coleman, Earl May, and Billy Higgins. Today was the only album by Hartman to ever appear on the pop charts, spending three weeks on the Cash Box Album Charts, where it peaked at No. 160. Reception Initial reception to the album was consistently positive. DownBeat awarded Today its highest five-star rating, and reviewer Robert Rusch hailed it as Hartman's \\"greatest recording to date. . . . Unconditionally recommended.\\" Rusch praised Hartman as \\"an exceptional ballad singer with beautiful control, sensitivity, and range,\\" and said, \\"he uses his exceptional shifts in tension and phrasing to completely immerse the listener in the lyrics, mood and coloring of the tunes.\\" He also applauded the backing musicians, calling them \\"an unusually inspired combo, which on its own plays five-star jazz.\\" Phyl Garland, music critic for Ebony magazine, welcomed Hartman's return to the recording studio and said, \\"He sings with a rare ease and intimacy as apparent on the standouts Betcha By Golly Wow and a version of Didn't We that is a tour de force of vocal range.\\" Billboard chose Today as a four-star Special Merit Pick, and Cash Box selected it as a Pop Pick, saying, Hartman \\"soars above the background gentility and supercool ambience to project a style that is both original and totally involving.\\" Village Voice reviewer Victor Stein wrote, \\"Hartman's voice, for me, is the finest of any male singer's. It's a rich baritone, to be compared to such things as port wine and the mists of a summer night. Yet, for all its richness, it is lean, objective, with no sentimentality clinging to its edges.\\" He mentions \\"Betcha By Golly, Wow,\\" saying, \\"This is a bubble-gum tune, and by treating it as such, Hartman raises it to the level of a tender jazz ballad.\\" More recently, however, Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gave the album low marks, saying, \\"Today, Johnny Hartman's first record for Perception, was a new beginning of sorts. It just wasn't a very good beginning.\\" Erlewine claims that the songs, though good, don't lend themselves to Hartman's vocal style, and he criticizes the production on the album. \\"There are moments on Today that work,\\" he concludes, \\"but by and large this is a missed opportunity. Gregg Akkerman, in his 2012 biography of Hartman, expressed mixed views about Today, saying, \\"[W]hen placed in the context of its time, some special music had been created. . . . Hartman recorded 'contemporary' hits in a manner that presented him as relevant without denying his past.\\" Akkerman highlights \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix,\\" with its \\"rock solid sense of time in the vocals and a devilishly technical Coleman sax solo,\\" and \\"the light R&B; groove of 'We've Only Just Begun' [that] provided Hartman with a comfortable backing over which to exploit the full dynamic range of his voice.\\" On the other hand, Akkerman criticizes the album's \\"overall harshness of sound and the incessant vocalizing of the pianist.\\" He concludes by saying that Today \\"offered an inspired collection of genres and tempos, [but] there are times it played like a demo for the album Hartman should have made.\\" Reissues Today has been reissued on compact disc with Hartman's other album for Perception, I've Been There (1973), initially as Today/I've Been There ‚Äì The Perception Years (Collectables, 1997), and then as Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head (Definitive, 2003).

It is closely related to the genus Salpiglossis, which provides the ornamental species Salpiglossis sinuata. Together, the genera Reyesia and Salpiglossis form the tribe Salpiglossideae within the Cestroideae. Historically, the species now placed in Reyesia have been held by some authors to belong to Salpiglossis, but are currently placed in a genus of their own by virtue of their tiny flowers and peculiar androecium (see description below).

The road allows traffic from Mombasa, destined for the central parts of Kenya to bypass downtown Nairobi, thereby reducing traffic congestion in the city's central business district. Location The road starts at the junction of the Nairobi‚ÄìMombasa Road and Airport North Road, in Embakasi, immediately west of Nairobi International Airport, approximately south-east of the city centre. The road then loops through the south-eastern suburbs of Nairobi, skirting the northern edges of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, through Ruai. The road then crosses from Nairobi County, into Kiambu County and then turns westwards, passes underneath the Thika Highway and ends at the Ruiru Kamiti Road, at a place called Ruiru Road Junction. The total length of the Nairobi Eastern Bypass Highway is approximately . Overview This road is intended to relieve traffic congestion in the capital city's central business district, by diverting long-distance traffic from and to the port city to Mombasa, destined for central Kenya and the counties directly north of Nairobi. In a similar effort, other bypass highways have been built on the northern and southern sides of Nairobi, with the objective of alleviating downtown traffic congestion. Construction The Government of Kenya, though the Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), built this highway and opened it to traffic in 2014. Initially constructed as single carriageway road, efforts were initiated in 2017 to convert the highway into a four-lane dual carriageway road.

She is most famous for her architectural sculptures, which often feature three dimensional visuals and elements of dynamic symmetry. Her work is featured in the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, as well as the Museum of Art in Kalmar, among other places.  Biography  Elli Hemberg was the daughter of the provost Johan Hemberg, and his wife Signe Hedenius, an artist whose father was the notable Swedish Professor of medicine Per Hedenius. She grew up in the Swedish town of Sk√∂vde, and later attended Wilhelmsons School of Art (1918-1922), run by the painter Carl Wilhelmson. In September 1923 Hemberg married the Swedish physician Sven Erlandsson in V√•mbs Church, outside Sk√∂vde. Over the following years she undertook several study trips around Europe: Italy and Paris (1923), Vienna and Italy (1925), Paris (1929), Norway (1937), and Holland (1938).  Career  'Badande' (1978)  Early Paintings  Hemberg's early work consisted primarily of portraits and landscapes. Her first major exhibition was as part of the 'November Exhibition' in 1922 at Liljevalch's Art Gallery in Stockholm. She then had her first solo-exhibition at 'Galerie Moderne' (1942) in Stockholm. In the 1940s she initiated a close collaboration with the avant- garde artist Otto Carlsund, who experimented with cubism, purism and neoplasticism. The two displayed their work in 1947 at Konstn√§rshuset in Stockholm. During this period Hemberg began transitioning towards a more abstract style, focusing on form and rhythm, which eventually led to her transitioning from painting to sculpture.  Sculpture  'The Orb' (1970) In the mid 1960s, Hemberg, together with Olle B√¶rtling and Karl G√∂te Bejemark, among others, were part of the art salon 'Samlaren', and considered at the forefront of Swedish sculptors. In the 1970s Hemberg began to achieve fame and acceptance in the art community, primarily through her sculptures, and she created a number of notable commissions for permanent public display, including: 'The Orb' (1970) for the National Archives of Sweden, 'Badande' (1978), displayed at the Museum of Sketches for Public Art in Lund, 'The Butterfly' (1980), displayed in R√•lambshovsparken in Stockholm, 'Solkrets' (1989), displayed at Viktoria place in Skellefte√•, and 'Three Leaves', displayed at Norrk√∂ping's Museum of Art. Hemberg's sculptures were often large architectural pieces in wood, glass, metal, or concrete. Her work was heavily influenced by Jay Hambridge, and thus often featured elements of dynamic symmetry, as well as three dimensional aspects. Egon M√∂ller-Nielsen's 'Djurriksdag' in the foreground and Elli Hemberg's 'The Butterfly' in the background. Today, many of her works are on display in Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm, The Museum of Art in Kalmar, as well as Sk√∂vde Art Gallery, among other galleries, museums, and permanent public displays.

It was in operation from 1909, before the building was demolished in the early 1970s. to make way for the construction of Shaw Tower.  History  Records showed that Marlborough Cinema, owned by Peranakan businessman Tan Cheng Kee, was in operation by January 1909. Before the establishment of Marlborough Cinema, another cinema, French Cinema, was set up as a tent on its site in 1906. The advent of ‚Äútalkies‚Äù, or sound films, led the cinema hall to undergo extensive interior and exterior renovations in 1930. On 1 May 1933, Marlborough Cinema came under the management of Amalgamated Theatres Limited. The first ‚Äúall-Malay talkie‚Äù film, Leila Majnun, premiered at the Marlborough on 27 March 1934.  Ownership under Shaw  In 1938, the lease for Marlborough Cinema under Tan Cheng Kee ran out, and thus the cinema changed hands to the Shaw Brothers. During this period of time, Marlborough Cinema showed mainly Chinese films, interspersed with the occasional Tamil film.  Demolishment  The cinema hall closed down in the late 1960s, before it was demolished in the early 1970s in order to build Shaw Tower.  Architecture  Marlborough Cinema was built on Beach Road, on a site known as the Raffles Reclamation Ground, which was created from past reclamation projects in the 1840s and 1890s Plans and sections of Marlborough Cinema dated 1909, showing a simple gabled structure that was internally lined with wooden benches. Building plans dated 1909 showed that Marlborough Cinema was a structure of simple construction: a large, corrugated zinc hall with a gabled roof. It was situated on a narrow, elongated plot of land. Wooden benches lined its interior, and were separated by aisles. From oral interviews, a recessed orchestral pit was presumed to have taken up space in front of the screen between 1909 and 1930, to house musicians who would play accompanying music to silent films. The topmost photo, dating to the 1920s, shows a flat-arch entrance way, with marquees displaying posters of movies currently showing at the cinema. Renovations carried out in 1930 wired the cinema hall for sound, and electric fans were also installed. The wooden benches were replaced by flip-up chairs, expanding the seating from 550 to 682, and presumably filling up the orchestral pit.

He was given the post of Governor of Jamaica, but died two months after landing there. A description of Cunningham appears in the introduction to Scott‚Äôs historical novel ‚Äò‚ÄôRob Roy‚Äô‚Äô. Early life Cunningham was the only son of William Cunningham of Boquhan and his first wife Margaret Erskine, daughter of David Erskine, 2nd Lord Cardross. He was Commissioner justiciary for Highlands in 1701 and 1702. By 1708, he married Jean Lennox daughter of John Lennox of Woodhead, Campsie, Stirling. Career Cunningham stood as a Whig for Stirlingshire at the 1708 British general election but there was a dispute among the parties and the sheriff, on the pretext that Cunningham had only lately acquired a freehold, made a double return. However the Whig majority in the House of Commons ensured that he was seated.as Member of Parliament on 11 January1709. He voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell, but made little impression in Parliament. He lost his supporters at Stirlingshire and at the 1710 British general election he lost the seat. However he was returned in the same election in a contest at his fall-back seat at Stirling Burghs. He supported a Tory candidate in a disputed election and was listed among the ‚Äòworthy patriots‚Äô who exposed the mismanagements of the previous ministry, but otherwise sided with the Whigs for most of the Parliament. He voted on 17 January 1712 against the Tory motion to send the younger Robert Walpole to the Tower, and on 7 February against the Scottish toleration bill. He twice told against the bill restoring lay patronage in Scotland and was teller for three other bills affecting Scotland. He presented an address on the peace from Stirling Burgh in March but also voted against the ministry over the French commerce bill in June. In 1713 he became a burgess of Edinburgh and was returned again for Stirling Burghs. He supported the Hanoverian succession and in January 1714, was reported to be travelling around the west of Scotland with his uncle Colonel John Erskine promoting Hanoverian addresses. He was Commissioner justiciary for the Highlands from 1714 to 1716. He voted against the expulsion of Richard Steele in March and in May he voted with other Scottish Whigs in favour of extending the schism bill to cover Catholic education. He was a signatory to the proclamation of George I in Edinburgh, and presented a loyal address from Stirlingshire in October 1714. He was introduced at court by the Duke of Argyll. Cunningham succeeded to his mother‚Äôs estate in 1715. He was returned unopposed for Stirling Burghs at the 1715 British general election and developed his connection with the Duke of Argyll. He was awarded the post of muster master in Scotland, which he gave up in 1716 to become a commissioner for the forfeited estates. He was described as ‚Äòthe honestest fellow among them‚Äô. He voted with the Administration in every recorded division, except that on Lord Cadogan in June 1717, when, with most of Argyll‚Äôs supporters, he voted with the Whig minority. He built on his father‚Äôs electoral interest in Stirling Burghs and also built up one at Inverkeithing. He bought tenements from the 1st Earl of Rosebery, and became provost of Inverkeithing in succession to him in 1720. With his pleasant manners and great address, Cunningham was considered to be the best boroughmonger of the time. In 1722, he became a Burgess of Glasgow and also succeeded to Boquhan on his father‚Äôs death. At the 1722 British general election, he was returned unopposed for Stirling Burghs again. When the work of the commissioners for the forfeited estates ended in 1725, he resumed the post of muster master in Scotland. He continued to develop a strong electoral interest in county and burghs and at the 1727 British general election was returned for Stirling Burghs and Stirlingshire, and chose to sit for Stirlingshire. By the 1730s he had become a key player in the electoral management system of Lord Ilay, Walpole‚Äôs electoral manager in Scotland. In 1733 he was wounded while acting as bodyguard to Walpole against an anti- excise mob. Cunningham was getting into financial difficulties and at the end of 1733, he asked Walpole for a post freeing him ‚Äòfrom the trouble of parliaments and elections‚Äô. He was appointed Governor of Jamaica. His departure was delayed when he was sent to Stirling at the request of Ilay, to oppose James Erskine, and Thomas, Lord Erskine, who were standing as opposition candidates there in the 1734 British general election. Death and legacy Cunningham did not arrive in Jamaica until 18 December 1735, and died less than two months later on 12 February 1736, aged 59. His wife predeceased him and they had no children. His estates were subsequently sold to pay his debts. Cunningham appears in an introduction to Rob Roy by Sir Walter Scott as putting Rob Roy to flight when the outlaw picked a fight with him. The author described Cunningham as uniting ‚Äòa natural high spirit and daring character with an affectation of delicacy of address and manners amounting to foppery.'.

M. Bergeron, (born December 22, 1946) is a Canadian cell biologist and biochemist. He is an Emeritus Robert Reford Professor of Anatomy and Professor of Medicine at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He is a Rhodes Scholar (Class of 1966). He is best known for the discovery of calnexin, endosomal signalling and organellar proteomics. Education Bergeron was born in Belleville, Ontario and grew up in and around the Montreal area, QC. He received the Montreal Science Fair award at Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1961 which allowed him to pursue his studies and receive a B.Sc. in honours biochemistry McGill University in 1966. He continued his graduate work as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, graduating with a D.Phil in biochemistry in 1969. From 1969-1971, he continued his post-doctoral training at the Rockefeller University (Supervisor: Dr. G. Palade). He then became an MRC Scientist the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, UK. In 1974, he opened his research lab in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University. He rose through the ranks becoming full Professor in 1982 and Departmental Chair in 1996. In 2010, he was made Professor of Medicine and transferred his lab over to the MUHC-Research Institute and stayed there until his retirement in 2015. Research and scientific career Dr. Bergeron's major contributions are in Discovery Research. He discovered with Dr. Barry I. Posner the paradigm of endosomal signalling. This paradigm defines exactly where and how hormones such as insulin and growth factors known to cause cancer act during health and disease. Dr. Bergeron also discovered calnexin with Dr. David Y. Thomas and uncovered the calnexin code along with Dr. Ari Helenius and Dr. Armando Parodi. This is the first elucidation of the mechanism of protein folding through a sugar-based code. Bergeron, Thomas, Helenius and Parodi demonstrated that when these proteins are synthesized in cells, the sugars that become attached to the proteins define a code to enable calnexin to guide protein folding. Correct folding is essential to form a functional protein and if newly synthesized proteins are misfolded then disease results. Calnexin through additional proteins that together makeup the calnexin cycle will not only guide folding but will also sense if folding is incorrect. When this happens, calnexin will send the incorrectly folded protein to be degraded through other sugar recognizing proteins that were again discovered with Thomas and separately by Helenius and Parodi. This represents the first protein folding code to be mechanistically solved and represents the basis for several protein misfolding diseases. Using the new technology of proteomics that Dr. Bergeron pioneered in Quebec and Canada, he elucidated the major resident proteins of the secretory pathway common to all cells. This led to the discovery of several proteins characterized for the first time involved in organ biogenesis and disease. With Dr. Michel Desjardins, Dr. Bergeron also discovered through proteomics and cell biology the importance of the transfer of endoplasmic reticulum constituents to phagosomes in antigen cross presentation in phagocytes and dendritic cells. Bergeron is also Founder of Caprion Proteomics Inc. and occupied positions of chief scientific officer, scientific advisor and chair of its scientific advisory board from 2000-2007. Bergeron is also past- president of the Human Proteome Organization (2004-2006) and is past-chair of its HUPO Initiatives project (2007-2008). Publications and scholarly activities Bergeron has published over 240 scientific manuscripts and was continuously funded through grants from CIHR, CFI, NIH, GQ, FRQS, NCI, PENCE and MRC throughout his career. Bergeron supervised 32 graduate students, 25 post-docs and 5 visiting scientists. He has given lectures regarding his work both nationally and internationally, is a member of several societies (7), and has participated in multiple grant committees (45) and editorial boards (8) throughout his career. Bergeron is also known as a strong advocate for Health Research in Canada through several OPEDs and interviews in several newspapers including Maclean's magazine, the National Post, the Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, the Ottawa Citizen, the Edmonton Journal, the Montreal Gazette and The Conversation.

The player may move in the cardinal directions using the arrow keys, and certain UI elements may be accessed through shortcut keys. 'I' may be inputted to access the inventory, 'L' for information on current location, and 'S' for game status; the Big Thruster's computer AI Sandie gives advice pertinent to the player's location and situation.(1988). Free Spirit Software. Free Spirit Software. Development Sex Vixens from Space was originally released in 1988 on the Commodore 64 and Apple II as part of the game compilation Sex And Violence Vol. 1, alongside Bite of the Sorority Vampires and Hatchet Honeymoon. Sex And Violence Vol. 1 cost $29.95 USD in 1988. The Amiga version of Sex Vixens from Space cost 'around 85' Deutschmark in 1988, and $39.95 USD in 1989. Alongside the real credits, there are several fake names with fake roles for comedic effect. The Commodore 64 and Apple II versions of Sex Vixens from Space are credited to Lance Strate, although it is unclear whether this is a real person, as the other two games in Sex And Violence Vol. 1, Bite of the Sorority Vampires and Hatchet Honeymoon, are credited to 'Dick Long' and 'Peter Grow' respectively. Other ports of Sex Vixens from Space had a larger development team.Sex Vixens from Space (1988). Amiga. Free Spirit Software. Free Spirit Software. Scene: Credits. Sex Vixens from Space was published by ASoft in Europe. While the Amiga and DOS versions of Sex Vixens support the use of a second disk drive to run both game disks at once, the Atari ST version is incompatible with using both disks at once, thus the disks must be swapped out as needed.(1989). Free Spirit Software. Free Spirit Software. Sex Vixens from Space was exhibited at the World of Commodore expo in 1989. A patched release of the Amiga version of Sex Vixens was released around October 1989. In the UK in 1989, a shipment of copies of the Amiga version of Sex Vixens from Space were seized by British Customs and subsequently destroyed due to their sexual content; while other publications did not specify a number, .info stated that 75 copies were destroyed. Joe Hubbard from Free Spirit Software defended Sex Vixens' sexual content in a statement to The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, stating that \\"While Sex Vixens from Space may be a bit racy, it is not pornographic. Apparently, the British authorities are either quite prudish or completely lacking a sense of humor. Regardless, freedom of artistic expression and the freedom to disseminate such are cornerstones of democracy. The act of seizing these game [sic] is the act of a fascist government.\\" Tim Harris, the CEO of ASoft, Sex Vixens' European publisher, said in a statement to Your Sinclair that \\"The game's been hyped up, but there isn't really that much sexual content. It's a heck of a lot tamer than Strip Poker.\\" In an interview with Italian gaming magazine Amiga Magazine, the president of Free Spirit Software, Joseph Hubbard, expressed that Sex Vixens from Space was inspired by the 1974 sexploitation film Flesh Gordon, stating that \\"When we made Sex Vixens, we thought of an old soft-core movie called Flesh Gordon ... It gave the public some eroticism and a lot of fun, although not necessarily in that order.\\" When asked about the moral impact of sexual computer games, Hubbard expressed that \\"Everyone has some fantasy, and there's nothing wrong with that. A computer cannot do more damage than what an individual can already do on their own. I prefer to see people play with erotic software rather than violent games.\\" Hubbard further expressed that \\"Anyone can sit at their computer and exterminate hundreds of aliens, or human beings in enemy uniforms ... Do you think this is healthier or less dangerous than sex?\\" Reception In in a June 1990 issue of STart magazine, the plot of Sex Vixens from Space was given as an example of sexism in the gaming industry and objectification of women in media. In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared Sex Vixens from Space the 19th-worst computer game ever released, stating that \\"This funny, sexy adventure game was neither funny, sexy nor adventurous.\\" German gaming magazine Aktueller Software Markt gave the Amiga version of Sex Vixens from Space an overall score of 3.2 out of 12, summarizing it as a \\"soft porno computer game\\" and calling the game's sexual content 'more tame' than what the cover or advertisements suggest. ASM criticized Sex Vixens from Space's graphics and text input, expressing that \\"If you're hoping for crisp graphics, you'll be disappointed. What is also disappointing is the adventure, specifically the core elements that determine the quality of the adventure. The parser should be red in the face should you flatter it by describing it as such. The graphics are thoroughly low quality, and the title screen is an absolute catastrophe: for this alone Free Spirit Software should be ashamed until the end of their days.\\" ASM also criticized Sex Vixens' plot as \\"stupid\\", as well as its 'disappointing' amount of sexual content, stating that \\"there is too little sex for a computer-porno, not enough processing power for a proper adventure, and too much money for both. Overall, the game's forgettable!\\" .info gave the Amiga version of Sex Vixens from Space an overall score of 2.5 stars out of 5, beginning their review by lamenting the game's glitches, expressing that \\"I wanted to like this game, and I know I would if it worked\\", but praised the game's adult content, stating that \\"The adults-only adventure game premise has been tried before, and this one comes very close to succeeding.\\" .info further criticized Sex Vixens' glitches, expressing that \\"all the effort has gone into the graphics and story rather than the programming\\", particularly criticizing the game's parser and text input, noting the 'limited' commands and stating that the game has abrupt lag spikes in which both the game and the parser are unresponsive. .info praised Sex Vixens' humor and \\"quite well done\\" graphics, but expressed that the game needed to be patched by the developers, concluding that \\"I hope Free Spirit will do the necessary fixes, because Sex Vixens has all the potential to become a deliciously funny and entertaining game.\\" Swedish gaming magazine Datormagazin gave the Amiga version of Sex Vixens from Space an overall score of 2 out of 10, bluntly captioning their review by stating that \\"Sex Vixens from Space is a piece of shit. Apparently it's broken too, and not even so-bad-it's-funny.\\" Datormagazin criticizes the game's plot as \\"tasteless\\" and furthermore calls Sex Vixens \\"a game which is so bad that you wonder why it even exists\\". Datormagazin praised Sex Vixens' \\"very well made\\" graphics, but expressed that they didn't make up for the game's shortcomings, stating that \\"what good will good graphics do if the rest of the game is pure shit?\\" Datormagazin criticized the lack of a save feature, expressing that it \\"characterizes the game's terrible quality well\\", and noted a glitch where if the player drops an item after picking it up for the first time, it may no longer be picked up. Datormagazin concluded their review by expressing that \\"[Sex Vixens] can be summarized in a single word: Avoid!\\" QuestBusters reviewed the Amiga version of the game in a September 1989 issue, criticizing the game's \\"inconsistent\\" interface & inputs, and \\"far below average\\" parser. QuestBusters noted Sex Vixens' possible inputs as 'limited', stating that \\"In most situations, the program won't even let you examine much of the surroundings\\" and expressed that this limited the game's puzzles, saying that \\"There aren't a lot of logical puzzles, since the parser won't even let you examine most items, let alone use them. Basically, all you can do is \\"make love\\" or \\"talk\\" to the women\\". QuestBusters further criticized the impact of Sex Vixens' limited inputs with regards to puzzles, expressing that \\"There's only one solution for each puzzle, and with such a limited vocabulary, you can fall into the trap of knowing the answer but get stuck trying to guess what synonym the game wants to hear.\\" QuestBusters praised Sex Vixens futuristic graphics as \\"slick and colorful\\", but criticized the 'bad' quality of the art of women in-game, stating that \\"Not only are the majority of the women ugly, but the actual drawings are drastically inferior to that of the space ships\\". QuestBusters furthermore criticized Sex Vixens minimal on-screen interaction with NPCs, expressing that \\"While most of these graphics [are of] professional quality, there are no people in 99% of them. This creates, oddly enough for a sex-oriented game, a sterile environment.\\" QuestBusters criticized Sex Vixens' nudity as 'ugly and unappealing', and further expressed that the game's \\"limited\\" erotic text was similarly unattractive. QuestBusters condemned the lack of a save feature as 'unreasonable' for a modern adventure game, and also criticized the lack of music and sound effects. Italian gaming magazine Game Republic noted Sex Vixens from Space as an oddity in a 2013 retrospective review, praising its \\"interesting narrative\\" but noted it as being \\"undeniably in poor taste\\" at times. Game Republic praised Sex Vixens from Space's \\"bizarre\\" environments and over-the-top presentation, calling it \\"a space opera as absurd as it is surprising\\".

They have a global distribution and live buried in soft sediment at depths varying from the intertidal zone to . Description Members of this family have oval or dumbbell-shaped bodies with a small number of segments, the prostomium often being separated from the rest of the body by a narrower segment. The peristomium is reduced to lips. The first segment of the prostomium, bears the mouth but no antennae, palps or nuchal organ. The first three segments bear rows of chaetae (bristles) and the next seven segments bear lateral bundles of tiny chaetae. The parapodia present on each segment are biramous except for those near the posterior end of the body which are uniramous. On the ventral side of the posterior of the body there are two chitinised calcareous plates forming a shield, the margins of which are rimmed with bundles of capillary chaetae. A number of long, semi- coiled, thread-like gills arise from the base of the shield. The deep yellow or reddish hard shield distinguishes members of this family from other worm groups. Behaviour This worm lives submerged, head-down in the sediment, with its thread-like gills on the surface, presumably to facilitate oxygen take-up. It is a deposit feeder and the pharynx is eversible. It is presumed that the worm scoops up dollops of sediment with the pharynx and then extracts the nutrients from what is swallowed as the main bulk passes through the long, coiled gut.

He usually lines out as a right wing-back. Playing career University College Cork On 23 February 2019, Murphy was joint-captain of the University College Cork team that faced Mary Immaculate College in the Fitzgibbon Cup final. He was at centre-back in the 2-21 to 0-13 victory. Murphy was involved in a second successive Fitzgibbon Cup final on 12 February 2020 when he once again served as joint-captain of the team. Selected at full- back, he suffered a broken finger which ruled him out for the remainder of the competition. However the UCC team prevailed after the 0-18 to 2-11 defeat of the Institute of Technology, Carlow. Sarsfields Murphy joined the Sarsfields club at a young age and played in all grades at juvenile and underage levels and enjoyed championship success in the minor and under-21 grades. Cork Minor and Under 21 Murphy first lined out for Cork when he captained the minor team during the 2015 Munster Championship. He made his first appearance for the team at centre-back on 8 April in a 2-20 to 1-13 defeat of Limerick. On 13 July 2017, Murphy made his first appearance for the Cork under-21 hurling team when he lined out at full-back in Cork's one-point defeat of Waterford. On 26 July he was again named at full-back but lined out at right corner-back in Cork's 0-16 to 1-11 defeat by Limerick in the Munster Championship final. On 4 July 2018, Murphy scored a point from centre-back when Cork defeated Tipperary by 2-23 to 1-13 to win the Munster Championship for the first time in 11 years. He was at right wing-back when Cork suffered a 3-13 to 1-16 defeat by Tipperary in the All-Ireland final on 26 August. Senior Murphy made his first appearance for the Cork senior hurling team in the pre-season Munster League on 2 January 2019. In spite of being named at left wing-back he started the game on the bench but was introduced as a half-time substitute for Aidan Walsh in the 1-24 to 1-18 defeat by Waterford. Managing career In Spring of 2019, Murphy was invited to join the management team of Ed Byrnely F.C. by Sporting Director, Bill Sheehan (hurler). His appointment was greeted with great enthusiasm amongst the Ed Byrnly faithful however he failed to live up to the hype with his team failing to win a single game under his stewardship. One particularly disgruntled fan in a post match interview for Ed Byrnely Fan TV compared his presence on the sideline to \\"a rabbit caught in the headlights.\\" His contract was cancelled on 25 February 2019. He has not taken up a managing position since then, nor is there any prospect of anybody hiring him as one in the future. Academic career Murphy has studied Process and Chemical Engineering in University College Cork since 2015. Tragedy struck in August 2017, however, when he was informed that he had failed two repeat exams and as a result would have to repeat second year. He has attributed his failure to \\"living like a cowboy\\". With the help of friends and family, Murphy did however manage to turn his life around and despite being unable to shake the affectionate nickname \\"repeatard\\", he has not had a single repeat exam for over two years. Personal life Murphy is a keen hunter, with a particular fondness for hunting wild pigeons.

The structure was built between 1917 and 1919 for the home of Savannah magnate George Ferguson Armstrong (1868‚Äì1924). It was owned by the Armstrong family from 1919 to 1935. Afterward, the structure and grounds served as the campus of Armstrong Junior College. Threatened with demolition, the Historic Savannah Foundation purchased the Armstrong House along with five other threatened historic buildings from the College for $235,000 in 1967. Once saved, Historic Savannah Foundation then sold the Mansion (and Hershel V. Jenkins Hall) at the exact purchase price to preservationist and antique dealer Jim Williams who restored it as his home. Eventually, both were sold to a major Savannah law firm as offices. The mansion was featured in The American Architect in 1919, and listed in A Field Guide to American Houses in 1984. George Ferguson Armstrong Armstrong was chief executive of Strachan Shipping Company, Savannah Marine Brokers; president of the Mutual Mining Company, extractors and shippers of Florida phosphate; and a director of the Hibernia Bank and of the Commercial Life Insurance and Casualty Company. He was a member of the Oglethorpe Club and the Savannah Cotton Exchange. In 1935, widow Lucy Camp Armstrong Moltz and daughter Lucy Armstrong Johnson donated the property for the campus of Armstrong Junior College at the request of the City of Savannah.Nussbaum, ‚ÄúA century of Savannah history.‚ÄùStone, From the Mansion to the University, 7, 15. Location and site The Armstrong Kessler Mansion is located in Savannah‚Äôs National Historic Landmark District at 447 Bull Street across from Forsyth Park. It is in Monterey Ward (the center of which is Monterey Square), one of twenty-four wards laid out in the form of James Oglethorpe‚Äôs original town plan. Other notable structures on Bull Street in Monterey Ward are the Mercer House and Temple Mickve Israel. Six city lots were acquired to build the Armstrong mansion, and two existing houses were demolished to make room for the 26,000 square foot structure. The entire site, including carriage house and grounds, is 0.5 acres. A view of the mansion from Bull Street, 1919. Original design The mansion was designed by the architect Henrik Wallin (1873-1936) in 1917 in an Italian Renaissance Revival style with interior elements of various established and experimental styles. The ten-bedroom home has nearly 26,000 square feet of living area. It is three stories over a full garden level with Granite balustraded terraces at each level. A broad hemicycle colonnade extending toward Bull Street offers a prospect of Forsyth Park. Other design features include a porte-coch√®re that opens into a side garden, an orangery, loggia, and sunporch. Exterior materials are granite and glazed brick. Bronze entry doors were fabricated by Bonachek of New York, with other doors in steel with bronze hardware. Windows were fabricated of steel and bronze by International Casement Company, now Hope Windows, which features the home in their promotional materials.McAlester and McAlester, A Field Guide, 406, Figure 6.‚ÄúHouse of George F. Armstrong,‚Äù The American Architect, Plates 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.Sottile, ‚ÄúArmstrong Kessler Mansion‚Äù video documentation. The attached carriage house was also three stories, having two garage bays designed for automobiles with front and rear entrances from the street or from the alley (or ‚Äúlane‚Äù as they are called in Savannah). Living quarters were between and above the garages. The street entrances thus approached the carriage house through the garden creating a circular drive, with one side passing through the porte-cochere.Ibid. The landscape plan consisted of two formal yards on either side of a wide graduated approach to the front entrance, orchestrated to match the grandeur of the main hall. The effect in front carried through to the rear, where a second entrance under the porte-cochere faced a large rear garden. Front and rear grounds were enclosed with 200 feet of ornate iron fencing resembling that of Buckingham Palace.Ibid. Site plan of the mansion and grounds, 1919. Interior design The main hall was designed with Italian limestone claddings with ornate plaster ceilings and cornices. Floor-length windows, cornices, panels, friezes, and details reflecting a range of styles are found throughout the interior. Rooms drew from various period styles including Georgian, Adamesque, Jacobean, and even Arts and Crafts. The house was fully electrified, and had a central vacuum system, recirculating hot water, and a ten port shower in the master bathroom.McAlester and McAlester, A Field Guide, 406.Sottile, ‚ÄúArmstrong Kessler Mansion‚Äù video documentation. Modifications With the acquisition of the Armstrong mansion in 1935 for the home of a city college, initially named Armstrong Junior College, the need for facilities led to the demolition of most of the carriage house and gardens and construction of Herschel V. Jenkins Hall, also designed by Henrik Wallin. When the property became the offices of the law firm of Bouhan, Williams & Levy in 1970, Herschel V. Jenkins Hall was demolished to make room for parking. Numerous non-structural modifications were made throughout to accommodate the law practice. With the restoration of the property begun in 2017 (see below), the gardens and a portion of the carriage house has been recreated.Nussbaum, ‚ÄúA century of Savannah history.‚Äù In popular culture The Armstrong Kessler Mansion setting has appeared frequently in popular culture. The house was used as the school of the daughter of the protagonist in Cape Fear, the 1962 psychological thriller starring Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, Martin Balsam, and Polly Bergen. The house also appeared as the real- life law office of attorney Sonny Seiler in the film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, a 1997 American crime drama film based on the novel by John Berendt and directed by Clint Eastwood.Kigar, ‚ÄúHouses with History‚Äù; ‚ÄúSavannah Scenes: Cape Fear (1962)‚Äù. Restoration The present owner, the preservationist-hotelier Richard C. Kessler, who acquired the mansion in 2017, commissioned a complete restoration of the Armstrong property. The structure, interior, and Italianate landscape are being restored as closely as possible to the original design with original materials. The architect and urban designer Christian Sottile developed the master plan for restoration. Interiors have been carried out by the designer Chuck Chewning. The plan includes a two-story recreation of the carriage house and the addition of a reflecting pool centered on the carriage house. The porte-cochere, carriage house, and garden pavilion frame a formal garden with fountains and Italian cypresses.Sottile, ‚ÄúArmstrong Mansion‚Äù video documentation.

He was a staunch supporter of Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Ancestry Makj√°n (or Mokyanus) was born into the minor and less significant Debr≈ë branch of the powerful and extended gens (clan) Aba.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Aba 5. Debr≈ë- Tarj√°n branch 1. Debr≈ëi) His father was B√∂k√©ny I, the owner of T√°llya and its castle in Zempl√©n County. Formerly, historian P√°l Engel incorrectly identified him as the son of Becse II, B√∂k√©ny's brother. In fact, Makj√°n III, the ancestor of the Debr≈ëi family and builder of the Makj√°n Castle (today ruins near Egerszal√≥k, Heves County) was his cousin. Makj√°n had two brothers, Philip and Nicholas. Career Alongside other lower nobles from Eastern Hungary and Transtisia, for instance Michael Balogsemj√©n, Rubinus Herm√°n and Mizse, he committed to supporting the efforts of King Ladislaus IV (\\"the Cuman\\"). Hungary's central government lost power because the prelates and the barons ruled the kingdom independently of the monarch. In order to eliminate the powerful barons' influence over the royal council, Ladislaus managed a self- coup in September 1286, expelling members of the K≈ëszegi‚ÄìBorsa baronial group from the government body. Neglecting the K≈ëszegis' rival, the Sz√©plak branch of the Aba clan, represented by Amadeus and Peter, Makj√°n's very distant relatives, Ladislaus IV appointed his own loyal soldiers and lesser nobles to the high positions. In addition, Ladislaus imprisoned his wife Elizabeth and granted all her revenues to his Cuman mistress. During his autocratic attempt, Ladislaus made Makj√°n Aba as Palatine of Hungary. Beside that, he was also appointed isp√°n of Sopron, Moson and Somogy counties. However these titles were purely nominal as the rebellious and oligarchic K≈ëszegi family ruled de facto independently the western parts of Transdanubia, including the aforementioned three counties by then. Makj√°n was mentioned in these four capacities only in a single document issued in S√°rospatak on 13 October 1286. Accordingly, Makj√°n summoned a \\"general assembly\\" (general congregatio) prior to that for the local nobles in Zempl√©n County, the ancient seat of the Aba kindred, at the command of the king. There Makj√°n judged over a homicide case between two nobles. It is plausible that Makj√°n held his dignity until spring 1287, when the K≈ëszegi troops defeated Ladislaus' army at the river Zsitva (≈Ωitava). The monarch was forced to reconcile with the barons thereafter; Ivan K≈ëszegi was made Palatine by June. After his brief and ephemeral role in the national government, Makj√°n lost all political influence and relapsed into the status of lower nobility. His lord and patron, Ladislaus IV spent the last years of his reign wandering from place to place, staying among his Cuman subjects. When Archbishop Lodomer absolved Ladislaus on condition that the king would live in accordance with Christian morals, the king also promised to dismiss his \\"perfidious, disgraceful Catholic advisors\\", which perhaps referred to Makj√°n, along with other nobles. Makj√°n was last mentioned by contemporary records in August 1288, when he and his brother Philip were present as witnesses during a determination of borders of three lands. Makj√°n still used the honorary title of palatine in the document.

The clinic claims that The medical team consists of medical oncologists, hematologists and internal medicine specialists. The CEO is Albert Schmierer, who owns a chain of nearby pharmacies specialising in homeopathy.  Controversies about the Hallwang Clinic  The Hallwang Clinic remains controversial. On the one side, the Hallwang Clinic is said to be the most high profile clinic in the European private cancer industry, centred in Germany, which attracts patients from the US, the UK, Australia and the Middle East. The Clinic describes itself as a pioneer in the field of personalised and precision-based oncology, though it does not publish data on patient outcomes or survival rates. On the other side, the costs at the private clinic are very high. More than half the ¬£8 million raised by cancer crowdfunding in the United Kingdom was for trips to the Hallwang Clinic. One father was charged ¬£600 per night for overnight stays in addition to the charges for his son and paracetamol tablets were charged at 12 euros for two. The clinic is particularly criticized for the combination of guideline-approved and complementary cancer therapies, such as hyperthermia and ozone therapy. An American breast surgeon, David Gorski wrote about a case where the clinic estimated a treatment at $120,000 with 80% deposit that had to be paid privately, as the clinic doesn't work with insurance companies. Gorski also criticized the policy that patients are asked to not talk to the press and that the Clinic \\"routinely couples unproven treatments with business practices that exploit the seriously ill\\".

For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads and a range of replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short (torpedo) level and a set of three chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern \\"traditional\\" yachts. In boat building lots of sanding requires using either dry sandpaper, or wet and dry paper, to achieve a reasonable paint or varnish finish. Sandpaper is graded from 40 (very coarse) to 400 (ultrafine). Wet and dry sandpaper lasts longer than dry sandpaper. Wet and dry is best used on paint finishes, while dry paper is best used on dry wood. About two sheets of sandpaper for every foot of hull length is a good guide. Less sheet sandpaper is needed if power sanders are used. Spatula applicators, with a flexible stainless steel blade, are used to apply filler. A knife type and a flat 3\\" (75mm) type will cover most needs. Silicon bronze screws are normally used in boat building but can be hard to locate. Brass fasteners are commonly available but apart from being softer and weaker the common brass alloys are much more prone to corrosion through depletion of their zinc content. Stainless steel screws may be used for attaching fittings to the hull above the water line. Type 316 stainless steel is the only stainless steel recommended. Even 316 may get stained with surface rust but this does not penetrate the surface. Staining comes from being in contact with other steels such as the anchor or incorrect cleaning in the factory. Staining near wields should be removed as it can pit. Experienced boat builders are reluctant to use even 316 below the water line in a boat permanently in salt water. This especially applied to long thin fastenings such as screws in boats that have motors. Sacrificial anodes are used to help prevent corrosion underwater but experts will inspect a sample of long thin screws or bolts annually to check for corrosion. Epoxy resins and hardeners are universally used in boat building due to their superior holding power and ease of use.West System International http://www.westsysteminternational.com/en/welcome/an- illustrated-history In its thickened state it is used as a strong filler and for a range of joints that do away with more traditional fastenings. A large supply of cheap wooden tongue depressors is useful for mixing and applying epoxy resin. The curved ends are useful for shaping coved joints with epoxy. Silicon bronze ring nails are excellent for permanent fastening of wood and ply as they are strong and easily driven. Many small boats are almost entirely fastened by epoxy resin. In stitch and glue construction the hull panels are temporarily held together with either copper wire, nylon fishing line or plastic cable ties, until the epoxy cures, after which the stitching material is removed. Polyester filler is a quick setting (20min), softer filler, suited to very small holes and scratches and is far more easily sanded to a fair shape than harder, stronger epoxy filler which takes 24 hours to set hard. Boat building requires enough space, under cover, so that the builder can easily move around the hull during construction, or the boat can be built on a trailer so the hull can be moved out of the shelter for construction sessions. It also requires space at the bow and stern not only for working but for sighting down the gunwale and chine lines to check they are fair. Have the bow at the garage door end for this reason. This is especially important in stitch-and-glue construction where no jig is used, as the ply panels are very floppy until the glue sets. Water-based paint is far easier and cheaper to apply, as undercoat, to produce a good smooth finish with a fraction of the time and effort of enamel paints, but harder and slower-drying enamel is best for the top coat on the outside of the hull, which is subject to a lot of bumps and scraps. Limit varnishing to smaller areas, such as grab rails, hatches, toe rails and trim, unless one has lots of patience and a very dust- free environment for varnishing. Use only marine gloss varnish on the outside, as interior varnish will peel off very quickly in hot sun and rain. Marine varnish has UV inhibitors to slow down peeling and fading. Never varnish a deck as it is slippery when wet. Even top-quality marine varnish is not as water-resistant as paint, so at least four coats must be applied. Often perfectionists will apply 8 coats or more to get a glass-like, reflective finish. Never varnish submerged parts like rudders. Boats take a long time to build as there are almost no right angles. Amateurs working at night or in weekends commonly take a year to build a craft. Builders with handyman skills will find that over time their skills will increase. For amateurs, starting with a boat built on a jig (temporary wooden frame) is useful as making the jig is all about right angles and basic carpentry skills. Sailboats require about 25% more time than a dinghy type because of the need for built-in buoyancy, centreboard case, centreboard, rudder, mast, boom and a range of special fittings such as chain plates, gudgeons, blocks cleats and tracks. Essential safety gear needed is closed-in footwear, very high grade ear protectors (especially if using a high-revving electric plane or router), eye shields when cutting or grinding metal, disposable gloves when gluing, close- fitting clothes that will not get caught in drills. Good light is essential. Boat builders should not work when they are tired and should keep the work floor clean so they don't trip over tools or wood or electric leads. A fan is handy for extra ventilation if the work space does not have many opening windows or doors. Many boat builders like smaller tools to be bright-coloured tools so they can see them easily amongst saw dust.New Zealand Backyard Boat Builder. J Welsford. Reed. 1999. With the recent technological advances in materials being used in modern boat building including GRP and FGRP respiratory protection masks have become essential in many workshops. The only suitable alternative being substantial dust extraction equipment by means of on-tool extraction or a fully fit out environmental cleaning workshop installation. Other useful power tools are a belt sander, especially if using recycled timber or for finishing rough-sawn timber. A thicknesser/planer is only needed if building many boats or larger vessels, as it is usually cheaper to pay a joiner to do this for a small amount of timber. A bench saw is useful if one buys larger sectioned timber, which may be considerably cheaper and need to saw it to the correct size, but again a timber yard will do this for a small charge.Backyard BoatbuilderJ Welsford.

Early life He was the son of Benjamin Blake, a sea captain turned indigo planter in Bengal. He spent time in the United Kingdom in the 1820s. From around 1830 to the early 1840s, he prospered as a sugar and rum manufacturer in India. Property developer During the 1850s, Blake was involved in developing the Ladbroke Estate, where he bought speculatively into land holdings from 1850, later acquiring other land on Lansdowne Hill. In 1852 he was living at 15 Devonshire Place, and was a director of the Portsmouth Railway Company. The solicitor Richard Roy was active in legal work on the Estate. Blake had Samuel Walker as partner. Employing capital from his Indian ventures, Blake bought land in London's Notting Hill neighbourhood. He survived financial overstretch to build extensively there, in the Kensington Park area. Over the period 1850 to 1853, the area east of Ladbroke Grove was developed quickly for housing by a group including Blake and Walker, Roy acting for them, Felix Ladbroke and the architect Thomas Allom. Blake and Allom were responsible for the houses (now consecutive nos. 24 to 33) on the north side of Kensington Park Gardens, Blake himself living at no. 24 during most of the 1850s. Blake made little or nothing on his initial property investments, handled to begin with through his solicitor; and he took losses on railway speculation in 1854‚Äì5.H. J.

Published by: Indiana University Press. He survived the property market upheavals of the late 1850s, though selling his Kensington Park Gardens house to tide himself over. He ultimately prospered in the 1860s by exploiting the opportunity of the new Hammersmith & City line, in which he invested and acted as a director. Questionable land dealings saw him pushed out of the railway company, but from 1864 his developer activities between the railway and Kensal Green thrived. Family Blake's widow Frances ran the Estate for some years after his death, to her own death in 1876. They had two sons and two daughters: *Charles Henry Blake (1835‚Äì1895), the elder son, a barrister, married in 1862 Josephine, daughter of Edward Amos Chaplin, and lived at Glendelvine, Dunkeld.

He attended Yale University and graduated in 2010 with an MFA. Influenced by the American tradition of road photography, Hatleberg's process entails driving throughout the United States and interacting with various strangers in different locales. His work was recently included in the Whitney Biennial 2019.  Artistic Practice  While speaking about his practice Hatleberg explained, \\"I feel a specific devotion to the unknown. It‚Äôs a kind of worship. When I stumble into the right person and place and feeling, I want to go all the way in and let it wash over me. In those rare moments, the world is so overwhelmingly generous; everything feels imbued with reverence and wonder.\\" Driving is an integral element to how Hatleberg creates his work and he frequently discusses this when asked about his photographic practice, \\"When I was a child, the only way my parents could get me to fall asleep was to put me in the car and drive around the block. Maybe it was the sound of tires on cement, or the rush of the wind pouring in that sedated me. Perhaps this is an origin story, why my work is still so much about driving.\\" In a published conversation with fellow photographer Matthew Genitempo, Hatleberg noted that \\"Chance and accident are the foundation of my entire practice. I start out with a vague notion, aiming towards a region I‚Äôm interested in, then wait until something feels right. It‚Äôs purely visceral. I like driving long distances, looking around, making it up as I go. It‚Äôs a loose approach that favors intuitive thinking over analytical design. Then, when I finally find a place, there‚Äôs no mistaking it; there‚Äôs an undeniable atmospheric weight. I can feel it come over me. A place that‚Äôs a sure thing will almost feel like a stage.\\" According to the artist, his photographs are intended to function as \\"a fiction that is more real than reality.\\" Hatleberg's roadtrips are lengthy and his editing process doesn't occur until later on - \\"I don't look over anything until I've shot hundreds of rolls.\\"  American Tradition of Photography  During an interview with the Birmingham Museum of Art Hatleberg articulated that he identifies most with \\"an American tradition of photography‚Äîfrom Walker Evans to William Eggleston. They are my heroes, but it‚Äôs undoubtedly a different time. I think it‚Äôs essential to take from tradition without being bound to it‚Äîto author one‚Äôs own time.\\" In 2015, Jordan Teicher wrote in Photograph,\\"Hatleberg‚Äôs photos succeed as social documentary, but to see them only that way ignores their freewheeling poetry, and their lack of any sort of useable, concrete information.\\" Hatleberg has also discussed fiction writing as an influence on his work, \\"After reading, everyone you pass on the street becomes fascinating or mysterious; the scenery shifts and everything seems infused with potent meaning.\\"  Exhibition History  \\\\- The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.

The curatorial statement by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta details, \\"Much of the art that we selected for the 2019 Biennial was steeped in socio-political concerns - an engagement important to us as curators - while at the same time remaining open ended and hopeful.\\" PBS Newshour reported \\"In a deeply divided America, the artists chosen by curators Panetta and Hockley exhibit a quieter tone than in the past. \\" Hatleberg's work was exhibited on the third floor.  Awards & Accolades   Grants  Hatleberg is a recipient of the 2015 Magnum Emergency Fund, the 2014 Aaron Siskind Foundation Individual Photographer‚Äôs Fellowship Grant, and the Richard Benson Prize for Excellence in Photography.  Publications  In 2015, TBW Books published Hatleberg's first monograph, Lost Coast. Throughout the series, \\"Hatleberg presents an episodic narrative about Eureka, California. Intimate portraits of town and people function like a collection of short stories, building to an understanding of place. The pictures live between extremes, between the grand and the granular, between the breathtaking natural landscape and the grim realities of industrial decline.\\" Hatleberg spoke of the project and explained that \\"when making Lost Coast, I attempted to make pictures that communicated more what my own personal experience of that place felt like, not what the place is really like. For me, the work is more like a dream I had about a real place than a depiction of reality. There‚Äôs this incredible hubris in to trying to portray a place or a person. How can a photographer ever possibly represent a unique region, lifestyle, or person within a few pictures?\\"  Commissions  Hatleberg's work has been published by The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, Vice, The Paris Review, and Mossless Magazine.  Teaching Appointments & Lectures  Hatleberg has taught photography at Yale University, Cooper Union, and the International Center of Photography. He has participated in numerous speaking engagements, including the 2019 Photographic Activities: A Salon at the Whitney.

Publicly released in February 2019, the game is designed to encourage collaborative communication between a human player and the AI player AllenAI. Iconary is the first demonstration of an AI system capable of playing a Pictionary-like game with a human partner. Researchers at the institute intended Iconary to highlight the potential of collaborative communication with an AI agent in a game setting, as contrasted with other highly publicized AI-backed games that place humans in adversarial roles against an AI system. Pictionary creator Robert Angel noted of Iconary \\"it‚Äôs not me against you, it‚Äôs us as a team against another team‚Äù. The AllenAI system behind Iconary can compose scenes based on a given phrase for the human player to guess, as well as attempt to guess a phrase depicted by the human player. The AllenAI system combines elements of computer vision, natural language understanding, and commonsense reasoning to compose scenes or to make guesses about a scene. The system was trained using data from collaborative games between two human players, using over 75,000 unique phrases and a constrained set of 1,200 icons. The phrases used in Iconary describe complex scenes or activities, e.g., ‚Äúpeople jogging in the park‚Äù or ‚Äúengineer riding a train‚Äù. The limited vocabulary of icons requires players to create novel combinations of icons to communicate a phrase to their partner, and to make use of abstract symbols (like arrows to signify motion) or contextual clues (like a stethoscope next to a figure of a person to signify \\"doctor\\") to successfully depict a concept.

Set in a tavern, it is also known as The Prodigal Son, The Return or Celebratory Party. It is now in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. The Merry Company, showing a group of drinkers, was a common subject-type in Dutch Golden Age painting. On 26 July 1620 the painter's return to Utrecht after about ten years in Italy was celebrated in the Utrecht tavern \\"Het Poortgen\\" at a welcome party attended by merchants, painters and copper engravers. It was extensively reported in the diary of lawyer, archaeologist and art dealer Aernout van Buchel. The painting may depict the gathering and the central figure in a blue shirt may be a self-portrait.Rose-Marie and Rainer Hagen, What Great Paintings Say, Benedikt Taschen Verlag, Keulen, 1994. , p. 328. In October the same year Van Honthorst married the tavern owner's daughter, his distant cousin Sophia Coopman, who may also have been at the welcome party. The work's chiaroscuro shows how much influence he had picked up from Caravaggio during his time abroad. The painting was probably acquired by Philip William, Elector Palatine around 1640 and it was definitely in his possession during the 17th century. In a 1716 inventory of his estate the work was entitled The Prodigal Son, tempted with drink and tenderness in a brothel, though it is unlikely that this was the work's original title since nothing in it refers directly to that New Testament parable. Whilst the artist does not seem to be warning of the consequences of wine, women and immoral behaviour, the flickering candle held by an old woman symbolises love, vanity and the transitory nature of beauty. The old woman herself contrasts with the three beautiful young women, making the work's main theme the passing of life.

History  The PC series of bombs differed from the SC series because they had thick cases for enhanced penetration of armored targets like warships or reinforced concrete fortifications. The PC 1000 was capable of breaking through most concrete roofs. While the SD series bombs could be used in a semi-armor piercing role the PC series of bombs were specifically designed as armor-piercing bombs. Since they had thicker hardened steel cases their charge to weight ratio was only 20% of their total weight. Bombs in the PC series included the PC 500, PC 1000, PC 1400, and PC 1600. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The smaller bombs had either Amatol or TNT while the larger bombs were filled more powerful explosives like RDX and Trialen to compensate for their reduced charges. The PC series of bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments. The PC series served as a base for the later PC RS series rocket propelled bombs which were designed to enhance penetration by increasing their terminal velocity.  Design  The PC series of bombs differed from the SC series because they had thick cases for enhanced penetration of armored targets like warships. The nose of the bomb was thick and the charge to weight ratio of the bomb was only 16%. The body was of one- piece forged steel construction which was filled through the base with TNT and was fitted with a magnesium alloy 4 finned tail with a cylindrical strut. There was a single transverse fuze pocket near the base of the bomb and there were two central exploders which ran through the explosives. The PC 1000 was horizontally suspended by a suspension band and H-Type suspension lug in a bomb bay or fuselage hardpoint. There were also trunnions for use by dive bombers. The body of the bombs were painted sky blue, while the tail was painted aluminum with a blue stripe.

Biography Born in Ambleside, Bree received his medical education at York and London.Anonymous. (13 November 1886). Charles Robert Bree, M.D. Edin., M.R.C.S. Eng., L.S.A., & C. The British Medical Journal 2 (1350): 954. He practiced medicine in Bildeston and Stowmarket. He married Frances Elizabeth in 1845. Bree obtained his M.D. degree from University of Edinburgh in 1858. He was elected physician to the Essex and Colchester Hospital in 1859 where he worked for twenty-two years. He authored books on natural history and was joint-editor of the Naturalist journal, with Francis Orpen Morris. He was a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. Bree rejected Darwin's theory of evolution and argued for creationism. In 1872, he authored An Exposition of the Fallacies in the Hypothesis of Mr. Darwin, which was widely criticized in academic journals.Wallace, Alfred Russel. (1872). The Last Attack on Darwinism. Nature 6: 237‚Äì239.An Exposition of the Fallacies in the Hypothesis of Mr. Darwin. Reviews and Notices of Books. The Lancet.

Bree was a Christian creationist who argued that proof of evolution could never be obtained.Moore, James R. (1979). The Post-Darwinian Controversies: A Study of the Protestant Struggle to Come to Terms with Darwin in Great Britain and America, 1870-1900. Cambridge University Press. pp. 199-200. However, he did not believe that the scriptures were intended to be authorities on science and his objections to evolution were not biblically based. He argued that Darwin's theories were speculations without evidence. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace criticized Bree for making errors and misconceptions about evolution. Wallace negatively reviewed the book in the Nature journal, stating it contained \\"numerous errors, misrepresentations, and misconceptions.\\" In a letter to Wallace, Charles Darwin supported his review and described the book as \\"a mass of inaccuracies & rubbish\\".\\"To A.

She works on membrane biophysics, including protein‚Äìlipid interactions, Alzheimer's disease and respiratory distress syndrome. She is a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and American Physical Society.  Early life and education  Lee was born in Hong Kong. Lee completed her bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at Brown University in 1986. She joined Harvard University for her graduate studies in applied physics, earning her master's in 1987 and PhD in 1992. She worked under the supervision of Eric Mazur on liquid-vapour interfaces. Lee was a postdoctoral researcher with Harden M. McConnell at Stanford University and with A. J. Waring at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Research and career  Lee joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1998, and was made a full Professor in 2008. She has made significant contributions to the understanding of molecular behaviour in lipid films. She investigates the functionality of lung surfactant, mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides, sealing effects of polymers and recognition of lipids in receptors that regulate immunity. She looks to control biomembranes that can mimic real-life systems to understand Alzheimer's disease and respiratory distress syndrome. Lee uses microscopy, x-ray and neutron scattering to establish the interactions of lipids and proteins. Lung surfactant, a lipid- protein mixture, forms at the alveolar air-water interface. A lack of surfactant in premature infants can result in infant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In an effort to improve interventions for patients with RDS, Lee's research group look to identify the relationships between structure and function in lung surfactant, as well as establishing how the surfactant interacts with nearby proteins. She also studies the role of amyloid beta, a residue generated by the processing of the amyloid precursor protein, and Alzheimer's disease. The Lee group look to establish a model for Ab aggregation, identifying which Ab isoforms are associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. She has also studied the mechanisms that allow the formation of the myelin sheath. Using transmission electron microscopy, her group studied the self-assembly of myelin lipids into tubules and subsequent transition into lamellar. Using atomic force microscopy the Lee group monitored the interactions of antimicrobial peptides with biomembranes. She demonstrated that peptides share a common interaction which is driven by membrane line tension reduction. Her research group developed a self-healing gel that works underwater; a synthetic version of the substance that mussels use to anchor to rocks in the ocean. Mussels contain byssal threads, which resist material failure by limiting crack propagation. The Lee group identified ways to control the crosslinking of catechol and Fe3+ using pH. Her group went on to study the mechanical properties of hydrogels regulated by pH, demonstrating it is possible to design a range of synthetic materials using mimicry of mussel proteins. Lee has also demonstrated that geometric tools can be used to study complex and non-linear biological interfaces. She showed that thin elastic membranes can adopt both periodically wrinkled or folded morphologies. When compression of membranes exceeds one third of their 'wrinkled wavelength', the membranes fold, eventually transforming into a symmetry-broken state that looks crumpled.  Academic service and advocacy  Lee served as Director of the National Science Foundation Materials Research Science and Engineering Center. Lee is committed to increasing opportunities for women and minority students to take part in scientific research, and regularly hosts students for summer research programs. Lee is an advocate for women in science, and was a founding member of the Chicago Collaboration on Women in Science. The collaboration supports women faculty members in Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. Lee served as a member of the steering committees of the University of Chicago centres in Beijing and Hong Kong. Lee was appointed Vice provost for Research in August 2018. In that capacity, she worked with faculty and deans to enhance and expand research activities at the University, and oversaw large-scale research structures, including University Research Administration, University of Chicago Consortium for Advanced Science and Engineering(CASE), Office of Research Safety, Research Computing Center and Research Development Support.

Biography  Charlotte was born in St Andrew's parish, Edinburgh, one of eleven children, including six daughters, of Alexander Nasmyth, the \\"foremost landscape artist of his day\\". Charlotte, in common with her siblings Patrick, Jane, Barbara, Margaret, Elizabeth, and Anne, worked as a studio assistant to her father in Edinburgh, and also taught art classes. After the death of their father in 1840, his legacy and an auction of 155 of the family's paintings gave the Nasmyth sisters financial independence, and enabled them move to England. Between 1831 and 1866, Charlotte exhibited her romantic landscapes and other works at the Royal Scottish Academy, the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Academy, and other institutions. She painted mainly in oils, and sometimes in watercolours, and also produced some etchings. Her subjects include landscapes of north Wales and various regions of England, as well as Scotland, indicating that she travelled widely throughout Britain. She was the most prolific artist of the six sisters. Modern writers have described her as \\"the most flamboyant and wildest\\", working \\"with a greater freedom and panache than her sisters\\". Contemporary reviewers described Charlotte's paintings as \\"little gems\\", \\"delicious small-room pictures ... meant to .. form the individual treasure of some limited sphere of its own.\\" Gnarled tree trunks with broken branches were a favourite subject of Charlotte's, and a reviewer in 1866 wrote of one of her landscapes, \\"This is the finest bit of tree painting in the exhibition; vigorous, crisp, and beautiful in colour.\\" Charlotte died in Putney, Surrey, in 1884.

The show celebrated the 41st Anniversary of the construction of Arena Naucalpan, IWRG's main venue where they hold the majority of their shows. The main event was originally scheduled to be L.A. Park against Penta 0M as result of IWRG's Triangular en Jaula, but instead if featured the Guerra de Familiars, or \\"Family War\\" between the father/son teams of L.A. Park/El Hijo de L.A.

In the semi-main event M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. defeated Mr. Electro to win the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. As part of the show Drag√≥n Bane successfully defended the WRG Rey del Aire Championship and Imposible defended the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship. The show featured three additional matches. Production Background Promoter Adolfo Moreno had promoted Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, Mexico prior to financing the building of Arena Naucalpan that opened in late 1976. Originally Moreno worked together with the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) and then later Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) as a local promoter. On January 1, 1996 Moreno created International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) as an independent promotion. IWRG celebrates the anniversary of Arena Naucalpan each year in December with a major show, making it the second oldest, still promoted show series in the world. pre-dating WrestleMania by eight years. Only the CMLL Anniversary Show series has a longer history. The 2017 Arena Naucalpan anniversary show marked the 40th Anniversary of Arena Naucalpan. The Anniversary shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general are held in Arena Naucalpan. Storylines The Arena Naucalpan 41st Anniversary Show featured a total of seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed themselves as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The original main event of the 41st Anniversary Show was originally determined at IWRG's Triangular en Jaula show long-time rivals Rush, Penta 0M and L.A. Park wrestled each other in a steel cage match. The stipulation of the cage was that, the first to escape the cage would not have to return a month later to compete in the main event of the Arena Naucalpan 41st Anniversary Show. RUsh left the cage first, which meant the main event was set as L.A. Park facing Penta 0M. When the full card for the 41st anniversary show Penta Om was not listed instead LA.. Park and his son, El Hijo de L.A. Park, would face his long time rival Rey Wagner and Wagner's son El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. Event After the Parks defeated the Wagners in the main event, El Galeno del Mal (\\"The Bad Doctor\\") appeared and helped the Wagners beat up L.A. Park and his son. Afterwards El Galeno del Mal was introduced to the audience as the half brother of El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., son of Rey Wagner's ex-wife Rossy Moreno.

History  The PC series of bombs differed from the SC series because they had thick cases for enhanced penetration of armored targets like warships or reinforced concrete fortifications. While the SD series bombs could be used in a semi-armor piercing role the PC series of bombs were specifically designed as armor-piercing bombs. Since they had thicker hardened steel cases their charge to weight ratio was only 20% of their total weight. Bombs in the PC series included the PC 500, PC 1000, PC 1400, and PC 1600. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The smaller bombs had either Amatol or TNT while the larger bombs were filled more powerful explosives like RDX and Trialen to compensate for their reduced charges. The PC series of bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments. The PC series served as a base for the later PC RS series rocket propelled bombs which were designed to enhance penetration by increasing their terminal velocity. The PC 1400 was also modified by adding a guidance package to become the Fritz X guided bomb.  Design  The body was of one-piece forged steel construction which was filled through the base with TNT or Trialen 105, a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminum powder and was fitted with a cast aluminum or magnesium alloy 4 finned tail with a cylindrical strut. There was a single transverse fuze pocket near the base of the bomb and there were two central exploders which ran through the explosives. The PC 1400 was horizontally suspended by a suspension band and H-Type suspension lugs or trunnions in a bomb bay. The body of the bombs were painted sky blue, while the tail was painted aluminum with a red or blue stripe.

Episodes Production Development In February 2014, Fremantle Media acquired the rights to adapt the novel as a fantasy drama series. In July 2014, it was announced that Starz would be developing the series with Bryan Fuller and Michael Green. Fuller stated that the series would be \\"[following] the events of the books but expanding those events, and expanding the point of view to go above and beyond Shadow and Wednesday\\". Permission has been given for the series to incorporate elements from the book's companion, Anansi Boys. Fuller also confirmed that Gaiman is \\"very involved\\" with the production and expressed his hope that Gaiman would write an episode himself. On June 16, 2015, Starz officially announced that it had greenlit the series. Showrunner Bryan Fuller estimated in May 2015 that the show would likely air in \\"late 2016\\"; however, it premiered in April 2017, and the first season consisted of eight episodes. The first season was initially set to consist of ten episodes. Filming Production began in March 2016, with filming primarily occurring in Toronto, as well as Brantford, Cambridge, Guelph, and Hamilton, Ontario, and Oklahoma. Writing Regarding the sexual content on the show, Green stated that while the book contains sexual content, \\"our sexual content, when it was portrayed, was artful. By that, we mean that it was essential to character, or essential to story. That it was as beautiful [as] anything else we were gonna try to portray in the show. Which is to say, if you're going to define gratuitous sexuality as sexuality that can be cut out and not diminish the final episode in any way, we weren't gonna do that. We wanted it to be something that was essential.\\" He also added that Starz wasn't \\"shy about nudity\\". The third episode features a gay scene between a businessman named Salim and a Djinn. Fuller admitted he wasn't concerned with the explicit sexual content that was featured in the scene, stating: \\"We wanted to tell a very graphic story with the sex and sexuality. And also tell a tale where a man comes from a country where homosexuality is punishable by death. For him most sexual experiences [would be] back-alley blowjobs, so the Jinn is making love to him probably for the first time in his life so he can experience sexual love. It's an amazing, beautiful experience for a human being to have particularly when you consider how many men, women and genders in-between, don't, or can't, because of where they come from.\\" Omid Abtahi, who portrays Salim, commented on the relationship, \\"I think love in any form, man/man, woman/man, woman/woman, whatever, is a beautiful thing. I would love to live in a world where people are not thrown off by that. So the way you do it is by exposing them to it, and normalizing it. Yes, it might be a little graphic for some people but it's natural. There's no hate. We're not trying to offend anybody. It's love.\\" Fuller also demanded a reshoot of the scene, claiming the original sex positions weren't physiologically possible for anal intercourse. The fifth episode's prologue showed a five-minute animation sequence that revolves around characters in the Ice Age. The sequence was created by Tendril, a design and animation studio that was based near Toronto, where the series is filmed. According to Tendril's director Chris Bahry, the sequence was difficult to make and it took six months to complete. According to Bahry, \\"The challenge was in finding the most powerful way to communicate the central theme of the sequence: faith vs survival and adaptation.\\" He also added, \\"We wanted it to feel very tangible and real, like a stop motion film that could have been made by these ancient people, using whatever materials and tools they would have had access to.\\" Casting On January 28, 2016, Ricky Whittle was cast as the lead character, Shadow Moon. On March 2, 2016, it was announced that Ian McShane had been cast as Mr. Wednesday. It was later announced on March 17, 2016, that Emily Browning would play Laura Moon, Shadow's wife. On March 23, 2016, it was announced that Sean Harris, Yetide Badaki and Bruce Langley would play the respective roles of Mad Sweeney, Bilquis and Technical Boy. On April 14, 2016, Jonathan Tucker and Crispin Glover were cast as Low Key Lyesmith and Mr. World. On April 21, 2016, Cloris Leachman was cast as Zorya Vechernyaya, Peter Stormare as Czernobog, Chris Obi as Mr. Jaquel, and Mousa Kraish as the Jinn. On May 6, 2016, it was announced that Sean Harris had departed the series due to personal reasons and the role of Mad Sweeney was being recast. On May 11, 2016, it was announced that Pablo Schreiber would take over the role of Mad Sweeney. In June 2016, it was announced that Gillian Anderson would portray Media. On June 15, 2016, it was announced that Omid Abtahi, Orlando Jones and Demore Barnes would join the cast as Salim, Mr. Nancy and Mr. Ibis, respectively. On July 15, 2016, it was announced that Dane Cook was set to appear as Robbie, and a week later, Kristin Chenoweth as Easter. Reception Critical response The first season of American Gods has received largely positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 92% rating with an average score of 8.12 out of 10 based on 83 reviews with the consensus stating: \\"American Gods opens with a series of wildly ambitious gambits ‚Äì and rewards viewers' faith with a promising first season whose visual riches are matched by its narrative impact.\\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 77 out of 100 based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for New York Magazine, called the show \\"a bizarre, dazzling show.\\" Ratings  Home media  The first season of American Gods was released on DVD and Blu- ray in Region 4 on July 19, 2017, and in Region 2 on July 31, 2017. The season was released in Region 1 on October 17, 2017, including over two hours of exclusive extras.

Early life Kathryn Madlyn Ainsworth was born Kathryn Madlyn Capomacchia on July 31, 1941. Capomacchia was raised by her mother, who was known to have anti-Semitic views. She introduced Kathy to the works of far-right political organizer Gerald L. K. Smith, founder of the Christian Nationalist Crusade and member of the Silver Legion of America. Kathy was a devout churchgoer. She taught Sunday school and sang in choir at Coral Baptist Church in Miami. Capomacchia attended college at Mississippi College in Clinton, Mississippi. In the spring of 1960, she roomed with Bonnie Barnes, the daughter of extremist Sidney Crockett Barnes - a devoted follower of Wesley Swift. In the years between graduation and marriage, Kathy Capomacchia and her mother were frequent guests at the Barnes home in Mobile, Alabama where she met her future lover, Thomas Albert Tarrants III. Around the summer of 1967, Kathy Capomacchia married Ralph Ainsworth. Radicalism Ainsworth and her companion, Thomas Tarrants, were both members of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, one of the most militant white resistance organizations during the Civil Rights era. Ainsworth, herself, was also a member of two additional KKK groups: the Original Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and the United Klans of America - as well as a Klan front called Americans for the Preservation of the White Race. According to police sources and numerous acquaintances of the two, older fanatics had influenced Kathy and Thomas with propaganda and hate material that came from organizations in Arizona, California, New Jersey and other states. Unbeknownst to her husband, Ainsworth began training in firearms and explosives in 1967. He was aware of his wife's Klan connections, but not of her deep involvement. Congregation Beth Israel bombing On May 28, 1968, Ainsworth, along with Tarrants, had participated in the bombing of the Congregation Beth Israel in 1968. Death Early on the morning of June 30, 1968, Kathy Ainsworth and Thomas Tarrants drove to the home of Meyer Davidson planning to place a bomb on his front porch. Ainsworth waited in their car while Tarrants attempted to blow up Davidson's home with a homemade bomb consisting of 29 sticks of dynamite. The FBI and local police, forewarned by Klan informants, ambushed the pair. Ainsworth was shot in the neck and died immediately. A loaded pistol and a KKK membership card was found in her purse. Right wing literature from groups including the Minutemen and the National States Rights Party was found during a search of her home. Tarrants survived numerous wounds and was sentenced to 30 years, but gained early release in 1976. The car's owner was identified to be Danny Joe Hawkins, a Ku Klux Klan hitman who had helped bomb Beth Israel.

On November 29, 2017, it was announced that Fuller and Green were departing the show and were to be replaced as showrunners for season two after having completed writing roughly half of the season's scripts. On January 12, 2018, Starz President and CEO Chris Albrecht clarified the ongoing struggle with mounting a second season, including Gillian Anderson's and Kristin Chenoweth's involvement, Fuller and Green's continued involvement ‚Äì stressing that they were never fired, nor did they quit ‚Äì given their schedules, and showrunner and budget concerns, while stressing the difficulty of adaptation and the network and Fremantle Media's continued commitment to the series. On February 2, 2018, Jesse Alexander, writer for Fuller's Hannibal and Star Trek: Discovery, was announced as co- showrunner for the second season alongside Gaiman. In September 2018, it was reported that Alexander had been removed as showrunner from the series by Starz and Fremantle. The series was also six weeks behind schedule and was forced to go on hiatus due to having an unfinished script for the season finale; Alexander submitted multiple drafts for the finale, but they were all rejected. Fuller and Green had scripted the first six episodes of season two, but they were thrown out once Alexander was hired to rewrite them. The season two episode order was trimmed from ten to eight episodes, similar to season one, in an attempt to trim the budget. The first season was $30 million over budget. Cast members were unhappy with the new scripts and they were often rewritten on set, including Ian McShane improvising dialogue. Starz was unhappy with Alexander's direction of the material, which was more \\"conventional\\", different from Fuller and Green's more \\"atmospheric, hypnotic\\" tone. With no showrunner, producing director Chris Byrne and line producer Lisa Kussner were left in charge. Filming Production began on the second season in April 2018, and with the season premiering on March 10, 2019. Writing During an interview with Neil Gaiman on June 24, 2016, he discussed plans for future seasons of the show beyond the first, should it be continued, and noting that the first season only covers the first third of the novel. The second season was intended to cover the Lakeside section of the novel, and \\"a big pivotal thing that happens to Mr. Wednesday\\" was likely to be a season finale for either the second or third season. However, the Lakeside arc was later pushed back to a potential third season. Casting On June 4, 2018, it was announced that Dean Winters, Devery Jacobs and Kahyun Kim would join the cast in the second season as Mr. Town, Sam Black Crow and Media; with the latter now known as New Media after the departure of Gillian Anderson in the role. It was also confirmed that Kristin Chenoweth would not be making an appearance in the season due to scheduling conflicts. Reception Critical response The second season has received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 60% rating with an average score of 6.11 out of 10 based on 27 reviews with the consensus stating: \\"American Gods retains its bombastic style but loses its divine inspiration in a derivative second season that, after a change in show-runners and even some crucial cast members, feels like a false idol.\\" On Metacritic, it has a score of 45 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

In vertebrates, five stages of decomposition are typically recognized: fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/skeletonized. The rate of decomposition of human remains can vary due to environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and the availability of oxygen, as well as body size, clothing and the cause of death.  Stages and Characteristics  The five stages of decomposition‚Äîfresh (aka autolysis), bloat, active decay, advanced decay, and dry/skeletonized‚Äîhave specific characteristics that are used to identify which stage the remains are in. These stages are illustrated by reference to an experimental study of the decay of a pig corpse.  Fresh  1: Fresh stage At this stage the remains are usually intact and free of insects. The corpse progresses through algor mortis (a reduction in body temperature until ambient temperature is reached), rigor mortis (the temporary stiffening of the limbs due to chemical changes in the muscles), and livor mortis (pooling of the blood on the side of the body that is closer to the ground).  Bloat  2: Bloat stage At this stage, the microorganisms residing in the human gut begin to digest the tissues of the body, excreting gases that cause the torso and limbs to bloat, and producing foul-smelling chemicals including putrescine and cadaverine. Cells in tissues break down and release hydrolytic enzymes, and the top layer of skin may become loosened, leading to skin slippage. Decomposition of the gastrointestinal tract results in a dark, foul-smelling liquid called \\"purge fluid\\" that is forced out of the nose and mouth due to gas pressure in the intestine. The bloat stage is characterized by a shift in the bacterial population from aerobic to anaerobic bacterial species.  Active Decay  3: Active Decay stage At this stage, the tissues begin to liquefy and the skin will start to blacken. Blowflies target decomposing corpses early on, using specialized smell receptors, and lay their eggs in orifices and open wounds. The size and development stage of maggots can be used to give a measure of the minimum time since death. Insect activity occurs in a series of waves, and identifying the insects present can give additional information on the postmortem interval. Adipocere, or corpse wax, may be formed, inhibiting further decomposition.  Advanced Decay  During advanced decay, most of the remains have discolored and often blackened. Putrefaction, in which tissues and cells break down and liquidize as the body decays, will be almost complete. A decomposing human body in the earth will eventually release 32g of nitrogen, 10g of phosphorus, 4g of potassium, and 1g of magnesium for every kilogram of dry body mass, making changes in the chemistry of the soil around it that may persist for years. 4: Advanced Decay stage  Dry/Skeletonized Remains  Once bloating has ceased, the soft tissue of remains typically collapses in on itself. At the end of active decay, the remains are often dried out and begin to skeletonize. 5: Dry/Skeletonized Remains stage  Effect of environmental conditions   Experimental analysis of decomposition on corpse farms  Corpse farms are used to study the decay of the human body and to gain insight into how environmental and endogenous factors affect progression through the stages of decomposition. In summer, high temperatures can accelerate the stages of decomposition: heat encourages the breakdown of organic material, and bacteria also grow faster in a warm environment, accelerating bacterial digestion of tissue. However, natural mummification, normally thought of as a consequence of arid conditions, can occur if the remains are exposed to intense sunlight. In winter, not all bodies go through the bloat stage. Bacterial growth is much reduced at temperatures below 4 ¬∞C. Corpse farms are also used to study the interactions of insects with decaying bodies. Burial Burial retards the rate of decomposition, in part because even a few inches of soil covering the corpse will prevent blowflies from laying their eggs on the corpse. The depth of burial, the nature of the soil, and the temperature and moisture content of the soil all affect decay.  Wet Environments  Submersion in water typically slows decomposition. The rate of loss of heat is higher in water and the progression through algor mortis is therefore faster. Cool temperatures slow bacterial growth. Once bloat begins, the body will typically float to the surface and become exposed to flies. Scavengers in the water, which vary with the location, also contribute to decay. Factors affecting decomposition include water depth, temperature, tides, currents, seasons, dissolved oxygen, geology, acidity, salinity, sedimentation, and insect and scavenging activity. Human remains found in aquatic surroundings are often incomplete and poorly preserved, making investigating the circumstances of death much more difficult.

While the SD series bombs could be used in a semi-armor piercing role the PC series of bombs were specifically designed as armor-piercing bombs. Since they had thicker hardened steel cases their charge to weight ratio was only 20% of their total weight. Bombs in the PC series included the PC 500, PC 1000, PC 1400, and PC 1600. The number in the bombs designation corresponded to the approximate weight of the bomb. The smaller bombs had either Amatol or TNT while the larger bombs were filled with more powerful explosives like RDX and Trialen to compensate for their reduced charges. The PC series of bombs were fitted with a time delay fuze which detonated the bomb after it had pierced a target destroying it with a combination of its blast and fragments. The PC series served as a base for the later PC RS series rocket propelled bombs which were designed to enhance penetration by increasing their terminal velocity.  Design  The body was of two-piece construction which was filled through the base with RDX and was fitted with a 4 finned tail with a cylindrical strut. There was a single electric base fuze and there was a charging head on the rear 1/3 of the bomb. The PC 1600 could be horizontally suspended in a bomb bay and when construction was terminated in 1942 there were no replacements. It is claimed that it could penetrate of armor or of reinforced concrete at a 60¬∞ angle when dropped from an altitude of .

Founded in 2017, Mammoth uses CRISPR as a genetic ‚Äúsearch engine‚Äù to alert researchers of disease markers it identifies. As a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley, Chen worked in the lab of CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna, receiving her PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology. Other Mammoth Biosciences founders are Jennifer Doudna, Lucas Harrington, CEO Trevor Martin and CTO Ashley Tehranchi--all Bay Area-trained scientists; at founding, the company set out to apply CRISPR technology to new frontiers.  Scientific significance  Collaborating with University of California at San Francisco researcher Charles Chiu who is on Mammoth's scientific advisory board, Mammoth is contributing to the international effort to produce a diagnostic test for the coronavirus referred to as COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus--cause of societal social-distancing and global quarantines--is detected from RNA extracts appearing on nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal respiratory swab tests; the Mammoth test is applied to detect nucleic acids so that an asymptomatic patient can be identified. The Mammoth method differs from earlier blood serum tests in that they been developed to detect antibodies. Mammoth focuses on Cas14, a protein more precise because of its smaller size than the more frequently applied Cas9 protein currently used by most biotech companies. Cas14 can be programmed to signal DNA evidence of a disease; a color change in the test solution indicates a negative or positive result. This test method has been named by Mammoth as DETECTR, SARS-CoV-2 DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter. DETECTR test results can be seen on a lateral flow strip within 30-40 minutes, a much quicker turnaround time with equal or better accuracy rates than currently available diagnostics. Its use adheres to current guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorizations (US FDA EUA). The power of Mammoth's DETECTR as an effective COVID-19 detector first appeared in a study released on April 16, 2020 analyzing the largest set of patient samples to date; this study contained the first peer-reviewed data applying CRISPR diagnostics to coronavirus research. Mammoth is also a partner with the gene-editing company Horizon Discovery.  Awards and Honors  Janice Chen was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 Class of 2018 acknowledging her as \\"among the most influential millennial professionals in healthcare.\\" Others named included her Mammoth Biosciences co-founding colleagues CEO Trevor Martin and Chief Discovery Officer Lucas Harrington and their CRISPR mentor Jennifer Doudna.

Early life and education Guyer was born in 1955 in New York City. She received her B.F.A. and M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute. Work Guyer makes paintings, drawings, site-based work, and artist books. Stephanie Snyder describes L√©onie Guyer‚Äôs work as the following: ‚ÄúThe richly layered, albescent grounds of L√©onie Guyer‚Äôs most recent paintings are inspired, in part, by the creamy surfaces of ancient Greek white-ground vessels, by the work of painters such as Piet Mondrian (1872‚Äì1944) and Giorgio Morandi (1890‚Äì1964), and by natural materials such as milk, bone, and chalk. Guyer mixes her paints by hand from raw pigments, often restricting her palette to the ‚Äúancient‚Äù primary colors (iron oxides, yellow ochres, and mineral-based blues), in addition to various blacks and whites. This alchemical chromaticism allows Guyer to experience the physical and energetic properties of each material as directly and as sensitively as possible. Hand-mixing paint is an intimate, timeconsuming, and repetitive activity, resulting in modest batches that settle and cohere in accordance with the subtle variations of each particular admixture of pigment, linseed oil, and mineral spirit. No two batches are the same, recalling the ancient philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus‚Äôs observation that ‚ÄúYou cannot step twice into the same river.‚Äù At the core of Guyer‚Äôs paintings and drawings is an awareness and embrace of life as a vulnerable and temporary moment within a measureless, universal continuum.‚Äù In his exhibition text, Anthony Huberman, the Director and Chief Curator of CCA Wattis Institute, writes: ‚ÄúL√©onie Guyer makes paintings and drawings. They consist mostly of abstract shapes, usually modest in scale, made with oil paint or pencil. In her mind, an artwork is a place where countless decisions are condensed and compacted together, and she works to intensify that concentration by keeping her paintings small and reduced down to their bare essentials: color, surface, and shape. She tries to do the most with the least. And yet to call her works ‚Äúsmall‚Äù is misleading. Better would be to say that she makes ‚Äúimmeasurable‚Äù works of art, which doesn‚Äôt mean that they are epic in scale but simply that they are not meant to be measured.‚Äù  Awards and fellowships  L√©onie Guyer received the following awards in her artistic career: Tosa Studio Award: Finalist Award (2018), Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant (2012), Sites ReSeen Grant, New York State Council on the Arts (2006), Fellowship, John Anson Kittredge Foundation (2002), Artist in Residence Grant, California Arts Council (1997, 1996, 1995), Murphy and Cadogan, Fellowship in the Fine Arts, San Francisco Foundation (1987) Selected exhibitions Guyer has had solo exhibits at Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, SF; odium fati, SF; Greg Kucera Gallery, Seattle; Lumber Room, Portland; and The Shaker Museum, Mt. Lebanon, NY and other venues. Other exhibitions include shows at UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Feature Inc., NYC, Peter Blum Gallery, NYC, Greg Kucera Gallery, Seattle, Lumber Room, Portland, OR, Douglas F.

The event commemorated the sport of lucha libre becoming allowed in the State of Mexico, with the first lucha libre show held in the state taking place in December 1962. Over the years IWRG has on occasion celebrated the anniversary, although not consistently holding an anniversary show every year. In the main event the trio of M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., Capo del Norte, and Capo del Sur defeated La Dinastia Imperial (\\"The Imperial Dynasty\\"; Rokambole Jr., Villano IV, and Villano V Jr.) by disqualification when Toscano attacked M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. during the match. In the semi-main event Aram√≠s lost to Freelance and Alas de Acero in a match where each wrestler represented a referee. As a result of Aramis' loss referee Reyes Rosas had his hair shaved off as a result. In the fifth match the team of Black Terry, Dr. Cerebro, Imposible, Ovett, Toscano, and √öltimo Gladiador won the Copa Higher Power. The show featured four additional matches Production Background The history of lucha libre, or professional wrestling in Mexico goes all the way back to the early 1900s where individual promoters would hold shows on a local basis in various Mexican states. In 1933 Salvador Lutteroth created Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL; Spanish for \\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\") and in subsequent years took EMLL to a national level. In the 1930s and 1940s various Mexican starts to create lucha libre commissions, often as an extension of the existing Boxing commissions, responsible for overview of lucha libre in each state, licensing wrestlers and ensuring the rules are being enforced. In the State of Mexico lucha libre was not officially sanctioned in late 1962, with the first sanctioned lucha libre show in the State of Mexico being held in December of that year. The Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has on occasion held a major show in December to commemorate the \\"birth\\" of Lucha Libre in their home state. It is unclear exactly when IWRG started to mark the Anniversary, records confirm that they held a show to commemorate the event starting in 2010 commemorating the 48th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico, possibly prior to that. The 2017 show was for the 55th anniversary and was held on December 3, 2013 in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico where IWRG holds almost all of their major lucha libre shows. Storylines The 56th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estadio de Mexico event featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

These workers have organized to address issues within the workplace, such as promoting gender equality, better working conditions, and higher wages. Women have participated in unions including the Collar Laundry Union, the WTUL, the IWW, the ILGWU, and the UAW.  Early union activity   1860s  The Collar Laundry Union was formed in 1864 in Troy, New York by Kate Mullany. It was the first entirely female labor union in the United States.  1890s  For five months, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan was appointed as a part-time organizer of the American Federation of Labor in 1892.  The Women's Trade Union League  left  Formation  The Women's Trade Union League of America (WTUL) was formed in November 1903 after three meetings at a convention for the American Federation of Labor. Mary Morton Kehew became president, Jane Addams the vice-president, Mary Kenney O'Sullivan the secretary, and Mary McDowell the executive board. An economic downturn in early 1904 caused union membership decline, and as a result, the WTUL struggled at its formation. The WTUL also discovered it was difficult to organize women due to lack of union knowledge and family obligations. Despite initial difficulty in organizing, the WTUL supported spontaneous strikes when the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) lacked funding. The WTUL offered groups of strikers help in exchange for their loyalty to the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Though the AFL affiliation caused issues within the league, the WTUL insisted on following the AFL's policies in order to retain status as reputable unionists. A body of strong strike leaders and organizers, including Leonora O'Reilly and Josephine Casey, was developed within the WTUL by 1906. Allies of the WTUL helped to organize walkouts, boycotts, walk picket lines, and raise funds for the league. In 1909 the WTUL purchased a large house at 43 East Twenty-second Street to be used a meeting place for all women unionists, as proposed by Mary Dreier, the WTUL's New York leader Prior, many women's trade unions had met in small, dirty meeting halls, which led the WTUL to believe that the spacious meeting place would be more inviting and attractive for smaller unions.  Outreach  To reach out and inform women in the workforce, the WTUL wrote the text New World Lessons for Old World People, which contained essays and stories with subjects pertaining to working conditions, conflicts due to ethnicity, and laws within factories. They also formed the Good Health League, which held lectures to inform women on their personal well being, and how their poor working conditions affected their health. Though many saw work as a temporary transition period between childhood and marriage, the WTUL attempted to urge women to view themselves as independent wage earners. Rallies and marches were held by the WTUL to protest police brutality women faced while picketing. Until 1955 the WTUL remained active.  Industrial Workers of the World  link=File:%22Mother%22_Jones_and_her_army_of_striking_textile_workers_starting_out_for_their_descent_on_New_York_The_textile_workers_of_Philadelphia_say_they_intend_to_show_the_people_of_the_country_their_LCCN2015649893.tif The IWW (Industrial Workers of the World) was founded in 1905. The IWW was founded by Mother Jones, Lucy Parsons, Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Daniel D. Leon, and Thomas J. Haggerty. Mother Jones was considered the IWW's \\"founding mother\\".  Garment work in 1909-1913   International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union  left In 1900 the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union was formed. 27,000 women joined the ILGWU by 1904, as estimated by The Women's Trade Union League of America. Early women's unions were often in the garment trade, as the industry employed many working women. Women in the garment industry often had to purchase their own thread and needles in order to work, and often were fined for errors in their sewing.  New York shirtwaist strike of 1909  Clara Lemlich In New York City working women employed by three major shirtwaist companies (the Leiserson Company, the Rosen Company, and the Triangle Shirtwaist Company) went to the Women's Trade Union League of America (WTUL) in 1909 to gain support in their strikes. Mary Dreier and hundreds of other women, were arrested while picketing. On November 23, 1909, Clara Lemlich's speech inspired the largest women's strike up to that point, which took place among primarily Jewish waist makers on the following day. The strike led more than 20,000 workers to walk out 500 shops in New York City. 10,000 women went back to work by November 27th,1909, after the smaller manufacturers agreed to the wages proposed by the unions. Larger manufacturers did not comply, forcing the strike to lead into December, and eventually spread to Philadelphia. During these months violence increased on picket lines; women were assaulted, harassed, and arrested. Some arrested women were sent to the workhouse on Blackwell's Island.  The United Auto Workers   World War II 1939‚Äì1945  More than 200,000 women laborers entered the automotive trade during World War II, causing upset in labor division. On October 15th, the UAW demanded that all female laborers were to be removed from work on heavy machinery or they would strike. After two more women laborers were hired, the strike commenced and was a victory after 36 hours of protest. As a result, women were permitted to only work in areas deemed appropriate for their gender. Women laid off from the auto industry were also unable to work in defense jobs as they were not protected under the OPM Six- Point Transfer. 50 women unionists gathered in late October, demanding a woman representative be appointed into the Detroit Defense Employment Committee, however, their demand was not met. This issue later became obsolete as the demand for wartime workers grew. By November 1943 26 percent of the automotive labor force was made up of women, as opposed to the previous 5 percent. On September 26, 1942, the National War Labor Board established that women and men must be paid the same rate, in order to settle disputes in labor forces. By September 1944, 105 women were delegates at the UAW's yearly convention.  Activism  Caroline Davis was elected president of Local 764 in 1944, and was reelected four more times. Davis in 1948 was appointed to the staff of the International Union, ending her presidency of Local 764. A CIO affiliate, the Detroit Industrial Union Council, elected its first woman organizer, Mae McKernan. After a proposal submission to the IEB, the UAW Women's Bureau was established, electing Mildred Jeffery as its first director. December 8th and 9th 1944 a women's conference was held and attended by 149 women from 46 states in 99 union locals. Women addressed concerns about postwar work and issues of workplace seniority.  Intersectionality  UAW leaders and the NAACP advocated for workers of color, resulting in the employment of black women in the automotive industry. Though protests occurred, the UAW continued to advocate for their African American employees, threatening to fire groups of workers on the opposition. As a result of the support from the UAW, black women became active in unions and sought positions of leadership. Lillian Hatcher, a black woman unionist in February 1944 organized local 742's first women's conference.  Postwar work 1945‚Äì1947  After World War II, despite efforts from women labor unionists, women in the automotive industry started to become frequently laid off, despite seniority. Women also found it more difficult to find work outside of defense jobs at this time. In Detroit 1945, outside of Ford Motor Company's factory, 200 unionized women held a protest in opposition to the company's widespread layoff of women laborers in favor of hiring of less qualified male workers.

Vinoth. Produced by Boney Kapoor, the film is a remake of the Hindi film Pink (2016). It features Ajith Kumar, Shraddha Srinath, Abhirami Venkatachalam and Andrea Tariang (reprising her role from the original film) in the lead roles along with Arjun Chidambaram, Adhik Ravichandran, Aswin Rao, Rangaraj Pandey, Sujith Shankar, Delhi Ganesh, and Jayaprakash in the pivotal roles. Nirav Shah is the cinematographer of the film, while Gokul Chandran is the editor. The film's soundtrack and background score was composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja and was released under the label of Zee Music Company. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed crores. Plot Meera Krishnan, Famitha Banu and Andrea Tariang are three independent young women living in Chennai who are best friends. One night, they happen to attend a party, enjoying themselves. On the other hand, rich boys Vishwa and Venkatesh take their friend, an injured Adhik Ramajayam, to the hospital. Adhik had been hit in the head and is bleeding profusely. However, the boys decide not to file a police complaint. Meanwhile, the women hurriedly return home from the party, agitated over something, but they try to forget it and carry on with their lives. During her morning exercise, Meera is observed by Bharath Subramaniam, a grim man living in their neighbourhood who was a successful lawyer and a loving husband to his wife Kalyani years ago. Kalyani had died due to pregnancy complications when Bharath had to leave her alone at home due to an important case. This causes Bharath to break down mentally and retire from his profession, coping up with his depression through the use of medications. Bharath senses from the look on Meera's face that something unpleasant had been going on in her life. Later, Meera files a complaint against Adhik and his friend as they had started causing misery in her friends' lives. Learning of this, Adhik orchestrates a gang to kidnap Meera and molest her, while threatening her to withdraw the complaint. She is later dropped back at home, but is arrested the next day on charges of prostitution and attempted murder by Adhik. Bharath learns of Meera's plight from her friends and fights the gang that aided Adhik's friends, capturing the main goon and handing him over to the police. He also returns to his profession by offering to help the women by representing them in their case. Soon a case is filed. Adhik's side is represented by Sathyamoorthy. Sathyamoorthy presents the events from Adhik's allegations that Meera and her friends were encountered by Adhik and his friends who then slept with them after having drinks. Adhik is hit on the head by Meera as a result of nonpayment, labelling the women as prostitutes. He bases this on the fact that Meera has a family but lives alone, Famitha having a relationship with an older man, and Andrea moving to Chennai from North India. Meera and her friends deny the allegations and state that the men tried to sexually assault them, prompting Meera to hit Adhik on the head with a bottle in self-defense. Bharath represents the women and bases their statement on the fact that a woman has the right to say no. Bharath and Sathyamoorthy question the witnesses and the women individually in the subsequent days, with Bharath's investigation proving successful in favour of the women. Towards the end of the trial, Bharath questions Adhik, who arrogantly says that \\"girls born in good families don't party or drink.\\" Bharath, however, holds a photo of Adhik's sister attending a party and having drinks in the courtroom, causing Adhik to lose his cool and curse Meera and her friends, stating that they \\"reaped what they sowed.\\" Consequently, he blurts out that he tried to rape Meera, shocking Sathyamoorthy. Bharath concludes the case by criticising the regressed views of the society where women are stereotyped as prostitutes if they come home late, yearn to be independent, drink and so on, but men are not affected by this. He also puts forth the fact that a wrong done is wrong; be it a man or a woman, there is no partiality before the law. The case ends with Adhik and his friends getting arrested.
