Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co- founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). Early life Giovanni was born in Cuneo in 1865, the second of four brothers born to Giovanni Ceirano, a watchmaker, and Teresa Corino.Treccani, Dizionario-Biografico. Profile of Giovanni Ceirano History In 1904 Giovanni founded the car manufacturer Ceirano Junior & C., which in 1905 changed its name to Junior Fabbrica Automobili Torinese. In 1906 he left Junior to co-founder and become managing director of the Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino (SCAT) He remained as Managing Director until 1918. In 1919 he founded the Fabbrica Automobili Ceirano with his son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\". Giovanni while Fabbrica Automobili managed the Ceirano gets the shares of the SCAT, getting a majority stake. On 25 August 1923 he increased the capital of SCAT by 700,000 liras by amalgamating Fabbrica Automobili Ceirano with 'SCAT' to form SCAT-Ceirano'. In 1929 SCAT-Ceirano suffers economic difficulties and FIAT acquired a controlling interest. In 1931 he left SCAT-Ceirano. In 1934 he acquired the car company Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA) again with his son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\". Fiat had imposed legal restrictions on the sale of SCAT-Ceirano preventing him from being an automotive manufacturer, so the FATA business was reoriented to make auto parts in 1945.

They are the discrete analogue of the continuous-stable distributions. The discrete-stable distributions have been used in numerous fields, in particular in scale-free networks such as the internet, social networksBarab√°si, Albert-L√°szl√≥ (2003). Linked: how everything is connected to everything else and what it means for business, science, and everyday life. New York, NY: Plum. or even semantic networks. Both the discrete and continuous classes of stable distribution have properties such as infinitely divisibility, power law tails and unimodality. The most well-known discrete stable distribution is the Poisson distribution which is a special case as the only discrete-stable distribution for which the mean and all higher-order moments are finite.  Definition  The discrete- stable distributions are defined through their probability-generating function :G(su,a)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty P(Nu,a)(1-s)^N = \\\\exp(-a s^ u). In the above, a>0 is a scale parameter and 0< u\\\\le1 describes the power-law behaviour such that when 0< u<1, : \\\\lim_{N \\\\to \\\\infty}P(Nu,a) \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{N^{ u+1}}. When u=1 the distribution becomes the familiar Poisson distribution with mean a. The original distribution is recovered through repeated differentiation of the generating function: :P(Nu,a)= \\\\left.\\\\frac{(-1)^N}{N!}\\\\frac{d^NG(su,a)}{ds^N}\\\\right|_{s=1}. A closed-form expression using elementary functions for the probability distribution of the discrete-stable distributions is not known except for in the Poisson case, in which :\\\\\\\\!P(Nu=1, a)= \\\\frac{a^N e^{-a}}{N!}. Expressions do exist, however, using special functions for the case u=1/2 (in terms of Bessel functions) and u=1/3 (in terms of hypergeometric functions).  As compound probability distributions  The entire class of discrete-stable distributions can be formed as Poisson compound probability distributions where the mean, \\\\lambda, of a Poisson distribution is defined as a random variable with a probability density function (PDF). When the PDF of the mean is a one-sided continuous-stable distribution with stability parameter 0 < \\\\alpha < 1 and scale parameter c the resultant distribution is discrete-stable with index u = \\\\alpha and scale parameter a = c \\\\sec( \\\\alpha \\\\pi / 2). Formally, this is written: : P(N\\\\alpha, c \\\\sec( \\\\alpha \\\\pi / 2)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty P(N1, \\\\lambda)p(\\\\lambda; \\\\alpha, 1, c, 0) \\\\, d\\\\lambda where p(x; \\\\alpha, 1, c, 0) is the pdf of a one-sided continuous-stable distribution with symmetry param√®tre \\\\beta=1 and location parameter \\\\mu = 0. A more general result states that forming a compound distribution from any discrete-stable distribution with index u with a one-sided continuous-stable distribution with index \\\\alpha results in a discrete-stable distribution with index u \\\\cdot \\\\alpha, reducing the power-law index of the original distribution by a factor of \\\\alpha. In other words, : P(Nu \\\\cdot \\\\alpha, c \\\\sec(\\\\pi \\\\alpha / 2)) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty P(N\\\\alpha, \\\\lambda)p(\\\\lambda; u, 1, c, 0) \\\\, d\\\\lambda.  In the Poisson limit  In the limit u \\\\rarr 1, the discrete-stable distributions behave like a Poisson distribution with mean a \\\\sec( u \\\\pi / 2) for small N, however for N \\\\gg 1, the power-law tail dominates. The convergence of i.i.d. random variates with power-law tails P(N) \\\\sim 1/N^{1 + u} to a discrete-stable distribution is extraordinarily slow when u \\\\approx 1 \\\\- the limit being the Poisson distribution when u > 1 and P(Nu, a) when u \\\\leq 1.

He was one of the founders of the Artists' Colony at Fischerhude. Life and work He was the son of an estate overseer and spent his childhood in the vicinity of Fischerhude. From 1863 to 1869 he studied art in Hanover and later went to Munich, where he was a student of Wilhelm von Diez.Katrin Bellinger Master Drawings In 1883, he became a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts there and the following year was appointed Court Painter for King Ludwig II, executing many watercolors of the King and his \\"secret residences\\".

Breling went so far as to devise a portable shelter, so he could paint the King outdoors in any weather.Breling Retrospective at the Otto Modersohn Museum After Ludwig's mysterious death, Breling returned to Hanover. For many years, he spent the summers in Fischerhude. He took his wife and six daughters there in 1908, setting up a home and studio in nearby Bredenau, which is still used by his grandchildren. His second eldest daughter, Louise, was the third wife of painter Otto Modersohn. In later years, he turned to impressionism, but his earlier paintings remained by far the most popular.

Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A.

Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco.

The school is located on two sites on the Isle of Portland in the English county of Dorset. History The Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy was formed in September 2012 from the merger of Brackenbury Infant School, Grove Infant School, Southwell County Primary School, Underhill Community Junior School and Royal Manor Arts College. As an academy, the school was originally sponsored by The Aldridge Foundation and Dorset County Council. A new campus, Osprey Quay Campus, opened in 2014. It was followed by the opening of the main campus site, Maritime House, in September 2016. In September 2016, Aldridge Education multi-academy trust took over the responsibility for all Aldridge Schools from the Aldridge Foundation. In October it was announced that the Academy would not be joining the multi- academy trust and that Aldridge were standing down as sponsor. Dorset County Council remains a sponsor. In November 2016, the school was inspected by Ofsted and declared inadequate. IPACA became Atlantic Academy Portland in September 2017, managed by Aspirations Academies Trust. Academics Aspirations Academies Trust is a multi-academy trust supporting 16 academies in Dorset, Banbury and Feltham in West London. The school they inherited was 'inadequate'; they aimed to create an academy where the students believed in themselves and were actively engaged in their own learning and saw a connection between the learning tasks and their ambitions for the future. They needed to create a challenging curriculum and disruption free learning. It is an ‚Äòall through‚Äô Academy, with all years housed within the same school building. An early change was to reduce the schools capacity, the PAN or school number in jargon, from 1580 to 1220, to have year groups of 60 in Primary and 120 in Secondary, where previously it was 60 and 150. This reduces overcrowding while allowing all pupils to be on a single site. =Curriculum= As an all-through school, with youngsters from reception class to upper sixth- there needs to be a unified teaching approach in all key stages, from Key Stage R to Key Stage 5. The Aspirations Academies Trust is developing a common curricular approach the will be used in each of its academies, albeit reflecting the local community and the particular needs of its students, It will contain : *The Early Years curriculum requirements, *The National Curriculum in Key Stages 1, 2, 3 and 4. *‚ÄòNo Limits: Education for success in the 21st century‚Äô-a trust wide KS2 and KS3 teaching scheme *The EBacc academic programme at KS4 *The trust CEIL programme at Post 16 =Current subjects= Learning in Key Stage Two is linked to a central topic, such as an Energy and Sustainability or ‚ÄòThe Middle East‚Äô. The topic mapping has been specially designed to support the needs of the pupils. At Key Stage 3, year 8 and 9 students study English, Maths, Science, French, Music, Art, Drama, RE, Geography, History, Design Technology ; Computer Science and Business Enterprise and PE. In Year 7 the students study the new No Limits Curriculum: which will include English, Maths, Science, French, Music, Art, Drama, Geography, History, Design Technology and PE. At Key Stage 4 students study a mixture of GCSEs and BTECs. All pupils study English, English Literature, Maths, and Science. They are allowed four options, two of which must be EBacc subjects, and two chosen from Art, business Studies, Drama, Music, Food, Product Design and Philosophy. The Ebacc subjects are History, Geography, French and Computer Science.

In each of these amendments except for the 1992 amendments, Congress extended the special provisions that were tied to the coverage formula, such as the preclearance requirement. These provisions were extended for five years in 1970, seven years in 1975, and 25 years in both 1982 and 2006. In 1970 and 1975, Congress also expanded the coverage formula, supplementing it with new 1968 and 1972 trigger dates. Coverage was further enlarged in 1975 when Congress expanded the meaning of \\"tests or devices\\" to encompass any jurisdiction that provided English-only election information, such as ballots, if the jurisdiction had a single language minority group that constituted more than five percent of the jurisdiction's voting-age citizens. These expansions brought numerous jurisdictions into coverage, including many located outside of the South. To ease the burdens of the reauthorized special provisions, Congress liberalized the bailout procedure in 1982, allowing covered jurisdictions to escape coverage by upholding the voting rights of protected minorities and affirmatively acting to expand minority political participation. In addition to reauthorizing the special provisions and expanding coverage, Congress amended and added several other provisions to the Act. For instance, Congress expanded the original ban on \\"tests or devices\\" to apply nationwide in 1970, and in 1975, Congress made the ban permanent. Separately, in 1975 Congress expanded the Act's scope to protect language minorities from voting discrimination. Congress defined \\"language minority\\" to include \\"persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage.\\" Congress amended various provisions, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement and Section 2 general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws, to prohibit discrimination against language minorities. Congress also enacted a bilingual election requirement in Section 203, which requires election officials in certain jurisdictions with large numbers of English-illiterate language minorities to provide ballots and voting information in the language of the language minority group. Originally set to expire after 10 years, Congress reauthorized Section 203 in 1982 for seven years, expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years, and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years. The bilingual election requirements have remained controversial, with proponents arguing that bilingual assistance is necessary to enable recently naturalized citizens to vote and opponents arguing that the bilingual election requirements constitute costly unfunded mandates. Several of the amendments responded to judicial rulings that Congress disagreed with. In 1982, amended the Section 2 general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws to overturn the Supreme Court case Mobile v. Bolden (1980), which held that Section 2 prohibited only purposeful discrimination. Congress expanded Section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory effect, irrespective of whether the practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose. The creation of this \\"results test\\" shifted the majority of litigation brought under the Voting Rights Act from claims of Section 5 violations to claims of Section 2 violations. In 2006, Congress amended the Act to overturn two Supreme Court cases: Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board (2000),Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, (2000) which interpreted Section 5 to prohibit voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a \\"retrogressive\\" discriminatory purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose, and Georgia v. Ashcroft (2003),Georgia v. Ashcroft, (2003) which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates. In response to the Supreme Court case Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which struck down the current coverage formula as unconstitutional, several amendment acts were proposed, but all failed to make progress. 1970 Anticipating the expiration of the Act's special provisions in 1970, Congress held extensive hearings on whether the Act should be amended and its special provisions reauthorized. Congress noted discrimination in voting continued in spite of the Act and that the Section 5 preclearance requirement had been minimally enforced since its enactment; between 1965 and 1970, covered jurisdictions had made merely 578 preclearance submissions. Ultimately, Congress determined that although significant progress had been made in reducing racial discrimination in voting since 1965, sufficient discrimination existed to justify extending the special provisions. President Richard Nixon's administration, which generally disliked civil rights laws but hoped to politically capitalize on the alienation of Southern white voters from the Democratic Party that the Act was causing, sought to reauthorize but weaken the law. Attorney General John N. Mitchell proposed a 3-year extension with amendments to extend the ban on \\"tests or devices\\" nationwide and abolish both the coverage formula and the preclearance requirement. Opposed by liberals and supported by Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans, this proposal initially passed in the House of Representatives, but it was rejected by the Senate, which crafted its own compromise bill. The Senate passed its version by a 64-12 vote, and the House then passed it by a bipartisan 237-132 vote. The legislation was enacted on June 17, 1970, as the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970.Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-285, 84 Stat. 315 (1970) (codified as amended in scattered sections of ) President Nixon signed it into law on June 22. Through this legislation, Congress extended the special provisions for five years. Congress also expanded the coverage formula by supplementing it with 1968 trigger dates, bringing into coverage several new jurisdictions outside of the South and appeasing several Southern legislators who felt the original coverage formula unfairly singled out Southern states. Simultaneously, Congress amended the bailout provision to require covered jurisdictions seeking bailout to prove that they had not used a test or device in a discriminatory manner in the ten-year period preceding their bailout request, an increase from the original five-year period requirement. Congress also expanded the ban on using tests or devices to the entire nation. Congress also added new provisions to the Act. Two new provisions exclusively regulated presidential elections: one created uniform rules for voter registration and absentee voting, and the other prohibited states from applying their own durational residency requirements as voting qualifications. Influenced by the draft of males at least 18 years of age to fight in the Vietnam War, Senator Ted Kennedy convinced Congress to add a provision guaranteeing citizens at least 18 years of age the right to vote in federal, state, and local elections. In a statement explaining his decision to sign the amendments, Nixon expressed doubts that this provision was constitutional, and he instructed the Attorney General to expedite litigation to test its constitutionality.Richard Nixon, Public Papers of the Presidents, June 22, 1970, p. 512. Later that year, the Supreme Court, in Oregon v. Mitchell (1970),Oregon v. Mitchell, (1970) struck down the part of the provision lowering the voting age in state elections as unconstitutional; the Court upheld only the part of the provision that lowered the voting age in federal elections. The decision precipitated the ratification of the Twenty- sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. 1975 Congress revisited the Act in 1975, the year that the Act's special provisions were again set to expire. The debate was less acrimonious than previous debates concerning the Act, reflecting an expanded consensus in Congress that the law remained necessary to remedy continued racial discrimination in voting. Unlike Nixon, President Gerald Ford's administration, which worked to improve relations with African Americans after Nixon's presidency, supported extending the Act without weakening it. After conducting several hearings, Congress passed legislation amending the Act; the Senate approved the amendments by a 77-12 vote, and the House of Representatives by a 346-56 vote. President Ford signed the amendments into law on August 6, 1975. The amendments extended the Act's special provisions for seven years. Congress chose seven years to avoid having to reconsider the special provisions during the 1980s reapportionment process. Relatedly, Congress amended the bailout provision to require covered jurisdictions seeking bailout to prove that they had not used a test or device in a discriminatory manner in the 17-year period preceding their bailout request. Congress also expanded the coverage formula by adding new dates in 1972 as triggering dates, which brought more jurisdictions into coverage. Furthermore, Congress made permanent the nationwide prohibition on tests or devices. The 1975 amendments also expanded voting rights for minority groups that traditionally had fallen outside the Act's protections. Civil rights organizations representing Hispanic, Asian American, Native Alaskan, and Native American interests argued before Congress that such groups often were the victims of discriminatory voting practices, particularly in areas where English was not the dominant language. After Congress heard testimony of language discrimination in voting, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan (D-TX) successfully led an effort to amend the Act to protect language minorities. Specifically, Congress amended the definition of \\"test or device\\" to prohibit laws requiring ballots and voting information be provided exclusively in English in jurisdictions where a single-language minority group comprised more than 5% of the voting-age population. This in turn expanded the coverage formula to reach states such as Texas that Congress wanted to cover. Congress also enacted bilingual election requirements, which require election officials in certain jurisdictions to provide ballots and voting information in the language of language minority groups. 1982 As the special provisions neared expiration again, Congress reconsidered the Act in 1982. Organizations in The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Education Association (NEA), organized to pressure Congress both to extend the special provisions and to expand the Act's general prohibition on discriminatory voting laws. Congressional opponents of the amendments had little support for their positions outside of Congress. The House of Representatives, which was the first chamber to consider amendments, conducted seven weeks of hearings on amendatory legislation at which over 100 witnesses testified, most of whom supported extending the Act's special provisions by at least 10 years. President Ronald Reagan's administration largely stayed out of the debate as the legislation worked its way through the House. However, President Reagan did indicate he supported replacing the coverage formula with a nationwide preclearance requirement. The House ultimately passed legislation maintaining the coverage formula and permanently extending the special provisions. Supporters of the House bill hoped to sustain the momentum from the House and expedite approval of the House bill in the Senate, but Senators opposing the legislation slowed its passage through extensive committee hearings. Furthermore, the Reagan Administration announced its support for only a 10-year extension of the special provisions. The Senate eventually compromised on maintaining the coverage formula unchanged and extending the special provisions by 25 years, except for the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirement, which was extended for seven years. The Senate also agreed to liberalize the bailout procedure to allow a covered state or local government to escape coverage by proving to the U.S. District Court for D.C. that it had complied with the Voting Rights Act and undertook constructive efforts to expand opportunities for political participation in the 10 years preceding its bailout request. The bailout procedure was also amended to allow a local government to bail out of coverage even if its parent state was covered.Voting Rights Act of 1965 ¬ß 4(a) (codified at ) The provision Congress most intensely focused on amending was Section 2, which prescribes a general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws. Two years earlier, the Supreme Court, in Mobile v. Bolden (1980), held that racially discriminatory laws violated the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments only if the laws were enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose; thus, showing that a law simply had a discriminatory effect was insufficient to state a constitutional claim of discrimination. The Court further held that Section 2 mirrored this constitutional standard.Mobile v. Bolden, (1980) The decision had a major effect on voting rights litigation; civil rights lawyers decided not to pursue many planned cases, and courts overturned several judgments that were previously entered in favor of plaintiffs. This prompted nationwide outrage that weighed heavily on Congress as it considered amending the Act in 1982. During the nine days of Senate hearings concerning whether to amend the Act, Section 2 was the primary focus‚Äîin particular, whether to amend Section 2 to create a \\"results\\" test that prohibited any voting law that had a discriminatory effect, irrespective of whether the law was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose. President Reagan opposed creating a results test because its impact would be uncertain. Furthermore, some members of Congress, such as Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), raised concerns that a results test would fundamentally alter American democracy by requiring courts to impose proportional representation for protected minority groups as a remedy. To assuage this concern, Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) proposed legislative language explicitly disclaiming that a results test would require proportional representation. This compromise won support from the Senate, the House, and the Reagan Administration. The House passed this version of the bill by a 389-24 vote, and the Senate passed it by an 85-8 vote. President Reagan signed the legislation into law on June 29, 1982. The creation of the Section 2 results test shifted the majority of litigation brought under the Voting Rights Act from claims of Section 5 violations to claims of Section 2 violations. 1992 As the bilingual election requirement in Section 203(c) neared expiration in 1992, Congress considered legislation to extend and expand it. Representative Jos√© E. Serrano (D-NY) introduced legislation, dubbed the Voting Rights Language Assistance Act of 1992, to extend the provision for 15 years, making its term coterminous with the other special provisions scheduled to expire in 2007. The legislation also expanded the coverage formula and the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirement to cover jurisdictions containing at least 10,000 persons of any one of the covered language minorities. This reached major cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Finally, in recognition of \\"the historical fact that reservation boundaries predate and therefore often do not correspond to State or county lines,\\" the legislation created an alternative coverage formula for Native American language-minority voters living on Indian reservations. This legislation received more Congressional opposition than the 1982 amendments did, most of it from Republicans. Proponents argued that the lack of bilingual assistance hindered recently naturalized citizens from exercising their voting rights and that the country had a history of acceptance toward linguistic pluralism. Opponents argued that the Voting Rights Act was never meant to protect language minorities and that the bilingual assistance provision was a costly unfunded mandate. Opponents proposed several amendments to weaken the legislation, including limiting the extension to 5 years, requiring the federal government to pay for the bilingual voting materials, and completely removing the bilingual provisions. These amendments failed, and Congress passed the legislation with mostly Democratic support; the House passed it by a 237-125 vote, and the Senate passed it by a 75-20 vote. President George H. W. Bush signed the legislation on August 26, 1992. 2006 Congress reconsidered the Act in 2006 as the special provisions were due to expire in 2007. Civil rights organizations advocated for the renewal and strengthening of the special provisions. As a matter of principle, Democrats generally supported renewing the special provisions. However, the Republican Party controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, and many Republicans considered the preclearance requirement an affront to states' rights and the principle of color-blindness. Furthermore, conservatives believed that the primary beneficiaries of the special provisions were African Americans, who overwhelmingly and increasingly voted for Democratic Party candidates. However, Republicans were receiving increasing support from some language minority groups, particularly Hispanics and Asian Americans, and they did not wish to risk losing that support by refusing to reauthorize the special provisions. Republicans also recognized that the Act often helped Republican candidates win by requiring jurisdictions to pack Democratic-leaning racial minorities into few electoral districts. In addition, House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) had a strong desire to reauthorize the special provisions, and he led an early effort to pass a reauthorization bill before his chairmanship expired at the end of 2006. Thus, a consensus in favor of reauthorizing the special provisions emerged early in the legislative process. In 2005, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution began holding hearings on amending the Voting Rights Act. Few witnesses at the hearings testified against reauthorizing the special provisions, and the committee focused primarily on assembling evidence of discrimination in voting. Congress's evidentiary record of voting discrimination was viewed as particularly important because Congress believed that according to the Supreme Court case Boerne v. Flores (1997) and its progeny, Congress needed to demonstrate that legislation passed to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments was \\"congruent and proportional\\" to remedying or preventing constitutional violations. To make this showing, the committee needed to assemble evidence to demonstrate that the special provisions were generally successful in combating racial discrimination in voting, but not so successful as to no longer be necessary. Given the uncertainty surrounding the congruence and proportionality standard, political constraints, and the Supreme Court previously having upheld the special provisions as constitutional, the committee decided to reauthorize the special provisions without amending the coverage formula. The committee ultimately included in the record four types of evidence to support this reauthorization: statistics showing rates of minority voter registration, turnout, and elective officeholding in covered versus non-covered jurisdictions; statistics showing the behavior of covered jurisdictions and the Department of Justice in the preclearance process; instances of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions; and data comparing successful Section 2 litigation in covered versus non-covered jurisdictions. On May 2, 2006, Representative Sensenbrenner introduced the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006.Pub. L. No. 109-246, 2006 U.S.C.C.A.N. (120 Stat.) 577 (codified at ) The bill proposed to extend the special provisions by 25 years and keep the coverage formula unchanged. The bill also proposed to amend the Act to overturn two recent Supreme Court cases: Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board (2000), which interpreted Section 5 to prohibit voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a \\"retrogressive\\" purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose, and Georgia v. Ashcroft (2003), which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates. While passage of the bill was virtually certain, a few Republican lawmakers attempted to amend the bill on the House floor. One group of legislators, led by Congressman Lynn Westmoreland (R‚ÄìGA), argued that the reauthorization unfairly targeted certain jurisdictions for long-past discrimination. Another group of 80 legislators signed a letter originated by Congressman Steve King (R‚ÄìIA) arguing that the Act's bilingual election requirements constituted costly unfunded mandates. All proposed amendments to the bill failed, though three received the support of a majority of the Republican caucus. Following the defeat of these amendments, the House passed the bill on July 13, 2006, by a 390-33 vote. Notably, this tally included many Republicans who had previously voted in favor of the failed amendments. Shortly thereafter, the Senate unanimously passed the bill without amendment on July 20, 2006, by a 98‚Äì0 vote. However, in an unprecedented event for a bill that passed unanimously out of committee, Senators of only one political party, Republicans, signed onto the bill's Senate committee report, and the report was not filed until six days after the bill's passage. The Senate report differed in significant ways from the House report, and in their own statement, Senate Democrats objected to parts of the Senate report that they believed highlighted evidence that could jeopardize the bill's constitutionality. The day after the committee report was filed, President George W. Bush signed the bill in a morning ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House on July 27, 2006, one year in advance of the 2007 expiration date. The audience at the signing ceremony included family members of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, the reverends Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, NAACP Chairman Julian Bond, and other civil rights leaders. Proposed Many proposals to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 have been unsuccessful or remain pending in Congress. In 2013 the Supreme Court, in Shelby County v. Holder, invalidated the Voting Rights Act's coverage formula; several bills have been proposed to create a new coverage formula. In 2014, the Voting Rights Amendments Act was introduced in Congress to create a new coverage formula and amend various other provisions. It was referred to the Constitution and Civil Justice congressional subcommittee on February 11, 2015, but no action was taken on it, and it expired. In 2017. Again in 2019, Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisconsin) and John Conyers Jr. (D-Michigan) introduced bipartisan legislation to update the Voting Rights Act. The bill's proposed coverage formula would cover 13 states with a history of voter discrimination: Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Arizona, California, New York, and Virginia.The House has passed a bill to restore key parts of the Voting Rights Act Ella Nilsenella, Vox, Dec 6, 2019 House Passes Bill to Restore Key Parts of Voting Rights Act MATTHEW DALY, AP/Time, DECEMBER 6, 2019 On December 6, 2019, the House of Representatives voted 228‚Äî187 in favor of the bill.

It used to be part of the former municipality of Capari. The Villages history dates back further than kept records, however, some of the oldest citizens claim the village has been around for well over 500 years. The village is situated at the foot of the Baba Mountain Range and on the border of the Bitola and Demir Hisar Municipalities. Due to the construction of the Stre≈æevo dam, the village itself has become abandoned. Apart from the rare visit back to the abandoned homes for activities such as wood collection for the winter it is, most of the time, empty. houses have mostly become overgrown with shrubs and bushes and the main town hall is falling apart due to the neglect. Stre≈æevo's former residents and their descendants do still gather in the village for \\"Ivan Den\\" which is celebrated at Stre≈æevo's monastery. This celebration takes place on 7 July. Ivan Day Celebrations in Stre≈æevo  Economics and politics  Stre≈æevo had close ties to neighbouring villages such as Crnovec, Metimir, Oblakovo, Strugovo and Crnobuki to name a few. the close relations were good for trade as these villages were much closer with more accessibility than Bitola has during a time where the automobile was not as accessible as today in the region. an important part of the growth of these villages was the marriages that took place between them. due to the small population of the villages most inhabitants were related to each other therefore usually the male would seek a wife in a nearby village and bring her back to start a family with her. This practice was crucial for inter-village relations and the growth of the village. some common family names from the village are; Naumovski, Bozinovski, Stepanovski, Lazarevski, Micevski and Markovski. Due to its location at the foot of the mountains, most of its trade came from tree lopping and the sale of locally farmed produce to the town of Bitola. Citizens used to make the commute by bicycle or horse if no automobile was available and sell their produce in the Bitola marketplace. This was one of the only ways a family would get an income and was of extreme importance. Though the village was mostly self-sustainable, it still was necessary for families to trade goods and services for money and trading in Bitola was of significant importance at the time.  Sport  Just as in the country as a whole, Stre≈æevo was heavily involved in Football. The village formerly had a Football team which played in the regional league playing against villages in close proximately however due to the building of the dam and relocation of its people the Strezevo team has since disbanded. Many of the Stre≈æevans (Stre≈æevtsi) who had relocated to Perth, Australia became heavily involved in the local Macedonian football club originally called East Perth Vardar, which later was known as Stirling Suns.  Current descendants  The Monastery in Stre≈æevo - Ivan Den 2005 most of the Stre≈æevo people currently reside in Bitola in a new suburb dubbed \\"Stre≈æevska Naselba\\" or \\"Gorno Orizari\\" which roughly translates to \\"Suburb of Stre≈æevo\\". A significant Number of Stre≈æevo's residents and descendants, however, have relocated abroad, mainly to Australia with some also relocating to Canada. There they have been heavily involved in local Macedonian Community administration and membership.  Flora and fauna  The flora and fauna in and around Stre≈æevo are the usual forms around the Baba Mountain region with a wide variety of blooming wild flowers and berries sprouting in the springtime after the snow and cold weather has passed. Some of the local wildlife include the brown bear which scathes the dense forest of the mountains lower slopes, a range of wild dogs from wolves to foxes and many bird species. Stre≈æevo also is home to a multitude of bee farms in which locals will come to harvest the honey from during the summer time. The village also had a technique for catching the local trout in the river. The Strezevski Pastramka would hide under large rocks, villagers would drop similar sized rocks on the rock in the water. This would either stun or kill the fish allowing for easy capture.

He advocates the destruction of the society created by the Sybl System, in which people are treated according to their stress level, and sees Enforcer Shinya Kogami as his nemesis. Makishima appears in most of the series' print adaptations, and makes cameo appearances in the films Psycho- Pass: The Movie (2015) and Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System (2019). The character was created by writer Gen Urobuchi, who intended to make him look alienated from his society. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani found the character likable, paralleling Kogami. Makishima is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai in Japanese, and Alex Organ voices him in English. Critical reception of the character has been largely positive, with his role as a strong villain (particularly his rivalry with Kogami) praised. Makishima and Sakurai's performance were well-received by Japanese fans in a Noitamina poll. Creation and development Makishima's rivalry with Shinya Kogami is seen from the perspective of rookie police inspector Akane Tsunemori. Makishima is usually calm (even during violent scenes) because he lacks humanity. According to writer Gen Urobuchi, one of the series' central themes is \\"fear\\"; Makishima feels out of place, but could have found happiness if he had been born into a normal world. Takahiro Sakurai was Makishima's Japanese voice actor. Naoyoshi Shiotani related to Makishima's dislike of the Sybil System's advanced technology and authoritarianism, and thought the character had more humanity than the policemen hunting him down; he also enjoyed Kogami's similar characterization to Makishima. The director said that parallels between protagonist and antagonist are common in fiction, reflecting a real-world individual's moral duality. Makishima is distinguished from Kogami by clothing color; Makishima wears white, and Kogami black. Their first names are also opposite; shogo is the portion of the day from midday and sunset, and shinya is the time from midnight to sunrise. Character designer Kyoji Asano said that he might be most similar to Makishima. According to the artist, the character's many facial expressions were the most difficult to articulate. Asano described him as \\"scary\\"; Makishima makes no effort to hide his insanity, making him difficult to draw. The designer said that he often had to tweak the handsome character's face to match his actions in the series. Takahiro Sakurai had no idea what to think about voicing until he read the script for the series finale. Sakurai grew to like the character to the point that he felt like Makishima was not dead. Director Shitoani said that although he originally saw the series from a police officer's point of view, he became sympathetic to Makishima. Sakurai said that despite his delight in killing, Makishima demonstrated humanity when he discovered that his only friend (Choi Gu Sung) had been killed by Chief Kasei. Shiotani agreed; they considered giving Makishima an extra scene in episode 20 in which the character talks to Sung, but it was not included on the DVD. Alex Organ voiced Makishima in English. Organ considered Psycho-Pass a step above what he had worked on to date; one of his first major roles, the narrative was darker than he had expected. The actor called Makishima complex, and was familiar with some of the series' Shakespearean passages. Appearances Makishima is the mastermind behind the many criminal cases investigated by the Public Safety Bureau, including one which led to the demotion of Kogami from inspector when one of Kogami's allies was murdered and his body dismembered. Despite Makishima's murderous intent, his Crime Coefficient (data collected on every member of society) never reaches a dangerous level. He claims that this is because his mind (and body) does not consider his murders and other crimes \\"wrong\\", but \\"sound\\"; this in turn makes him immune to the Dominator weapon worn by Inspector Akane Tsunemori. During the series, Tsunemori unsuccessfully tries to prevent Makishima from killing one of her friends. Makishima tries to destroy the Sybil System by distracting the Bureau forces with chaos in the streets, but is arrested by Tsunemori after a fight with Kogami. The Sibyl System offers to spare his life if he will join them; he escapes, however, loathing the way the system acts like \\"gods\\". Although Makishima tries to convince Kogami to join his planned bioterrorism to weaken Japan's economy and destroy the Sybil System, his plans are foiled by Bureau forces and Kogami kills him. Makishima also appears in the series novelization, which expands on his relationship with Choe Gu-sung. In the prequel novel, he is the mastermind of the case in which Mitsuru Sasayama died and Kogami became an Enforcer. Makishima also appears in the manga adaptation, Inspector Akane Tsunemori. In the films Psycho-Pass: The Movie (2015) and Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System (2019), he appears in Kogami's hallucinations because of their similar ideas about justice. Studio: Production I.G. Studio: Production I.G. Makishima is a supporting character in the visual novel, Psycho-Pass: Mandatory Happiness. Reception =Critical response= Critical reaction to Makishima has been generally positive. His orchestration of several crimes was praised, but Kotakus Richard Einsbeis criticized his Deus ex machina immunity to the system. Thomas Zoth of Fandom Post called Makishima's murder of Tsunemori's friends a \\"horrible\\" scene due to its impact on the main character, who finds herself helpless to stop the antagonist. Kotaku praised Makishima's balance with Tsunemori in the series' second half. Jacob Chapman of Anime News Network described Makishima as \\"the voice who speaks to our minds, to the self-assured sci-fi lovers who have 'seen this all before' ... Urobuchi's act of rebellion against making 'just another dystopia' ... he's the key element that makes it a work of thoughtful art rather than wild entertainment.\\" In his Fandom Post review, Thomas Zoth wrote that Makishima's cruelty to Tsunemori made the viewer feel \\"empty inside.\\" During the series' second half, Kyle Mills called the character \\"a fantastic series villain.\\" His fights against Shinya Kogami were also the subject of praise; Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network appreciated the series' use of weaponry, but criticized Urobuchi's attempt to make the two rivals similar psychologically. About Makishima's later development, Dong wrote: \\"It's as if the series was making a last ditch effort to humanize a villain that it had spent the entire time trying to portray as a social aberration\\". Although Zoth first lampooned the use of oats in Makishima's plan, he later found the oat field a good setting for the series finale. An ANN reviewer found Makishima's cameo appearance in Psycho-Pass: the Movie as Kogami's hallucinations \\"a little silly\\". According to an ANN review of Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System, Kogami must kill Makishima to get revenge. ANN writer Gabriella Ekens analyzed Makishima's tendency to cite literary works, most notably 1984 by George Orwell (set in a dystopia similar to Psycho-Pass). Ekens compared Makishima and Kogami to Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad; Makishima (Conrad's Kurtz) forces Kogami's Marlow to abandon his ideals. The character relates to Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche, aligning with Nietzsche about morality and ideals. =Popularity= In a Noitamina poll, Makishima was voted the best character voiced by Takahiro Sakurai and ranked second in the Mister Noitamina category. Sakurai was also praised by Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network for giving the character a \\"creepily soothing tone\\". Other polls have included Makishima as one of Sakurai's best anime performances. Ekens cited him as her favorite anime villain, and one of Gen Urobuchi's best-written characters.

The band formed in Sweden in 1996, disbanded in 2010, and reformed in 2014. Their music references The Chronicles of Narnia by C. S. Lewis. History Liljegren and Grimmark met for the first time in 1993 in J√∂nk√∂ping, a town in the south of Sweden. At this time Liljegren and his band Modest Attraction were just about to release their first album, The Truth in Your Face. Grimmark was a member of a band named Sentinel. They remained in contact over several years, during which both had trouble with their bands. Modest Attraction produced its second album Divine Luxury in 1996, at the same time as Grimmark decided to leave Sentinel. Liljegren phoned Grimmark and asked him whether he was interested in working together on a project. Liljegren had a passion for melodic hard rock, which he was not able to explore in the band Modest Attraction. Grimmark was instantly interested in a project along those lines. A few months later Liljegren called Grimmark again and told him that Modest Attraction would go on tour to Germany and the guitar player Stephan Mohlin could not accompany them. Thus Grimmark replaced Stephan. Stephan soon left the band all together, and Grimmark was asked whether he would like to become a full-time band member. Grimmark accepted, thus giving Liljegren and Grimmark time to plan their project. They took a few old songs from other bands and altered them to their own preferences. In September 1996 they went into the Top Recording Studio. Grimmark played all of the instruments and Liljegren sang. The recordings took several months. They had several guests on the album, including Jakob Persson, who later played bass in Narnia. Janne Stark (Overdrive, Locomotive Breath, Baltimoore) was responsible for a guitar solos and Mart Hallek played the violin. In January 1997, the recordings was finally finished. After hard work the album Awakening was mixed. Thanks to their manager Magnus S√∂derkvist their album was taken up by ten Japanese labels. Nine of these labels wanted to take Narnia under contract, finally Narnia decided for Pony Canyon. In May, Liljegren and Grimmark went on their last tour with Modest Attraction. They met Matthias Mittelst√§dt, who possessed an enterprise named MCM Music. Mittelst√§dt, along with his brother, Rainer Matthias, loved the album and Mittelst√§dt became their manager. With a demo in hand and new management, they began to search for talented new members and finally Narnia was born. Subsequently, the group signed with Nuclear Blast Records, and would release the albums Long Live the King (1999), Desert Land (2001), and The Great Fall (2003) on that label. They opened once for Stratovarius during this time. A live-DVD and live album was released of their concert in Germany, both titled At Short Notice... Live in Germany (2006). The following album, Enter the Gate (2006), was released on MCM Music, as was the compilation album Decade of Confession (2007). On April 9, 2008, Narnia began recording their latest album. On April 29, Liljegren announced his departure from the band. On August 29, the band announced on their official MySpace that the new vocalist is Germ√°n Pascual. Germ√°n grew up in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, but moved to Sweden in his teens. Previously he has worked with various bands and artists, such as Minds Eye and Mendez. Course of a Generation was released in Europe by Massacre Records on July 24, 2009. On April 15, 2010 the band announced that they would be breaking up. On October 20, 2010 they announced that they would hold two final concerts - one in Germany, and one in Mexico. Original keyboardist Martin H√§renstam (Cla√©sson) rejoined for the final two concerts. Post-breakup and reunion Since their farewell shows in Mexico City, (at Revolution Metal), and Germany, (at Christmas Rocknight), there has not been a great deal of information about the members of Narnia. That changed on January 22, 2012, as former frontman Carl Johan Grimmark took to the band's official MySpace and revealed that he had been quite busy in the past year. According to Grimmark, he had joined the band Jerusalem during the summer of 2011, playing guitar and keyboard. He also stated that he was also involved with the band Full Force, composed of Mike Andersson, vocals (of Cloudscape), Anders Johansson (of HammerFall, formerly of Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force) Stefan Elmgren (formerly of HammerFall) and Tommy Larsson (formerly of Heed). He hinted at something big taking place in the future, but has since remained tight-lipped regarding the news. On January 31, 2014, the band announced they were active again, celebrating the 15th anniversary of their Long Live the King album by playing live shows and re-releasing the album as a deluxe edition.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Tom Herpich, from a story by Mark Banker, Steve Little, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, Thurop van Orman, Pendleton Ward, and Merriwether Williams. It originally aired on February 21, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake must defeat the three bosses of a video game they are transported to from inside BMO. \\"Guardians of the Sunshine\\" was the first episode of Adventure Time to feature three-dimensional animation. The scenes set inside the titular computer game were animated by CalArts graduate Ke Jiang. The episode was met with mostly positive critical reception, and was seen by 1.73 million viewers. Plot Finn and Jake are playing the Side- scrolling video game Guardians of the Sunshine, and Finn attempts to use a combo move to beat the final boss (a toad named \\"Sleepy Sam\\"). He, however, fails and angrily remarks that if he were actually in the game, he could easily beat Sleepy Sam. But BMO explains that actually being in the game is extremely dangerous. However, BMO's warning goes unheeded, and Finn and Jake eventually decide to trick BMO into transporting them into its \\"Main brain game-frame\\", which allows them to be realized as characters in Guardians of Sunshine. The duo attempt to beat all of the game's bosses‚ÄîBouncy Bee, Honey Bunny, and Sleepy Sam‚Äîbut soon realize that their adventuring skills do not transfer in this new digital environment. After Finn and Jake lose several lives,(with Jake jumping in to a fire pit twice and Finn being killed by Bouncy bee and Sleepy Sam) they attempt to break out, accidentally causing the game to glitch. Finn, Jake, as well as Bouncy Bee, Honey Bunny, and Sleepy Sam, are all ejected into the real world, and the three bosses decide to destroy BMO for imprisoning them. Luckily, Finn manages to successfully use the combo move from the beginning of the episode, destroying the monsters. Production \\"Guardians of Sunshine\\" is the sixteenth episode from the second season of Adventure Time. The episode was written by Ako Castuera and Tom Herpich. A separate group of writers‚ÄîMark Banker, Steve Little, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, Thurop van Orman, Pendleton Ward, and Merriwether Williams‚Äîcame up with the idea for the episode, which Castuera and Herpich adapted to a storyboard. The creator of Adventure Time, Ward was the showrunner during this season, although he later resigned from that position during the fifth season. The episode is the first in the show to use animation not drawn entirely by hand. The scenes set in the game are rendered three- dimensionally, stylized with discernible polygons and a low frame rate reminiscent of stop motion. These were done by Jacky Ke Jiang, a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts. For the production of the characters and the environment in the scenes, Jacky was responsible for producing their models, rigging their meshes, and animating them by himself. In total, the scenes run for almost six minutes. Release and reception Cartoon Network originally aired \\"Guardians of Sunshine\\" on February 21, 2011. The episode was viewed by 1.73 million viewers and scored a 0.3 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.3 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The network released the episode on DVD, first in 2012, as part of the It Came from the Nightosphere box set, and later in 2013, as part of a box set for the complete second season. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 itemized the episode in a list of fictional depictions of virtual reality. Ben Bertoli of Kotaku similarly listed it as one of the best episodes related to video games in animation. Anders praised the episode for its humor and described the animation as in the style of third-generation video games, a return to how virtual reality was first depicted in fiction. Matt Fowler of IGN called it a high-quality episode of the second season, while Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club described it as an episode representative of the show as a whole. Jason Holmes of Destructoid wrote positively of John DiMaggio, who voices Jake, and anticipated that the episode could be the best one of the series. Bertoli praised the animation and found Finn and Jake voluntarily entering the game unique, though according to Ren√© A. Guzman of the San Antonio Express-News, who found the episode inspiring of a game based on Adventure Time, it was comparable to Tron. The network later released the first video game based on the show in 2012. Marked by the involvement of Ward, Jeff Schille of Game Rant wrote that this came to no surprise, given \\"Guardians of Sunshine\\" and \\"Dad's Dungeon\\" from the third season.

The buildings were demolished in 1831. The abbey has been described as \\"one of the key churches and most significant monuments in Antwerp from its foundation in the 12th century to its destruction in the nineteenth.\\"B.

Van Der Stighelen (Brepols: Turnhout, 2005), p. 157. History Until 1124 a collegiate church dedicated to Saint Michael and served by 12 secular canons was the only parish church in Antwerp. In 1124 the chapter was reformed by St Norbert as a Premonstratensian abbey. The abbey buildings stood between what are now the streets Kloosterstraat and Sint-Michielskaai, and Sint-Jansvliet in the north and the Scheldestraat (Kronenbrugstraat) in the south. The abbey obtained large tracts of land in and around Antwerp, such as the lordships of Kiel and Beerschot, the land of Haringrode and Zurenborg, and as late as 1674 Berendrecht and Zandvliet, which helped shape the ultimate territory of Antwerp. The abbey was partly destroyed by the French army during the War of the First Coalition in 1796. Many of the buildings were demolished to create military barracks and a naval arsenal with shipyards and slipways. In 1807 the tower of the abbey church was equipped with a semaphore. In 1831 the French barracks were bombarded by the Dutch garrison Commander David Hendrik Chass√©, whose troops were holding the Citadel of Antwerp. Art An engraving showing the paintings in the refectory Isabella of Bourbon (1436-1465), second wife of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and the mother of Mary of Burgundy, heiress of Burgundy, died in the abbey in 1465 and was buried in the abbey church. In 1476 a monumental tomb was erected in her memory. It was decorated with 24 bronze statuettes of pleurants standing in niches, known as 'weepers' or 'mourners', with a bronze effigy of Isabella herself surmounted on it. The remnants of the pleurants are now kept in the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam) and in M - Museum Leuven. The rest of the tomb, with the statue of Isabella, is now in Antwerp Cathedral. Nothing more of the tomb furnishings survives. In the 17th century the monastery was well known as a patron of the arts, commissioning works from major Antwerp painters such as Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens. Around 1624 Rubens delivered a monumental altarpiece for the abbey church, The Adoration of the Magi. It was stolen during the French occupation and after 1815 was returned to the Royal Museum of Fine Arts (Antwerp). The floor with many tombstones was transferred to the Cathedral of Our Lady, that had lost its floor during the French occupation. The 18th century communion bench and the confessional are now in the Church of St Gertrude in Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands).

The episode was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Tom Herpich, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on August 8, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, the Earl of Lemongrab (voiced by Justin Roiland) finds out that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Isabella Acres as a young girl, and by Hynden Walch as an adult) has reverted to being only 13 years old and tries to usurp the Candy Kingdom throne. While Finn and Bubblegum initially try to use pranks to coerce him into leaving, Bubblegum eventually makes herself 18 again so she can re-claim the throne. \\"Too Young\\" was the first of only three episode of the series to have been boarded by Moynihan and Herpich. The episode introduced the character of Lemongrab, who would go on to reappear in many other episodes. The episode was watched by 2.089 million people and received largely positive critical reviews. It was later nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program in 2012. Plot At the Candy Kingdom, Finn and a young Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Isabella Acres) are spending the day together. Now that Bubblegum is his age, he is actively trying to woo her, using advice that he learned from Jake. Because Bubblegum is now \\"too young\\" to be legal ruler of the kingdom, her first creation, the Earl of Lemongrab (voiced by Justin Roiland), usurps the throne. Lemongrab is loud, abrasive, and tyrannical, and threatens to send people to the kingdom's dungeons for the slightest infraction. Bubblegum and Finn decide to prank him until he leaves. This culminates in them poisoning his food with the equivalent of hot sauce; however, he discovers their ruse and sends them both to the dungeon. In the dungeon, Bubblegum realizes that she needs to return to her 18-year-old self, but she lacks the \\"candy biomass\\" necessary to do this. Her loyal citizens then sacrifice pieces of themselves, sticking them to her body. However, a catalyst is required: the heat from a \\"whopping love hug\\", which Finn provides. Bubblegum reverts to her original form, fires Lemongrab, and sets the kingdom straight. However, she scorns Finn's advances now that she is older. Jake, via the telephone, comforts Finn, telling him that the key to success is to be persistent and dedicated. Production alt=The image depicts a man wearing glasses and headphones (pictured in 2010). \\"Too Young\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Pendleton Ward, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and Mark Banker. The episode was the first that Moynihan and Herpich worked together on. The two had been \\"comic pen pals\\" before their time of Adventure Time, and had long wanted to work on an episode together. Cole Sanchez, who was serving as one of the series' creative directors during season three, storyboarded both the short scene featuring Lemongrab being animated by Bubblegum, as well as the ending, featuring Jake detailing how Finn must \\"go up the wizard steps\\" to achieve love. In reference to the latter, Sanchez noted that it was \\"indirect foreshadowing\\" for what was to come in the show. The episode marks the introduction of Earl of Lemongrab. According to Moynihan, the character was undefined in the beginning; he and Tom redefined him to make him \\"stranger and more distinct\\" so people would remember him as a villain. A rough design for Lemongrab was made by Moynihan; Herpich later added his clothes and sword. The character's original name was \\"Lemonsour\\", but this was later changed. The character itself voiced by Justin Roiland. After hearing Roiland's audio, Moynihan noted that it was as if a \\"dream came true\\", due in part to Roiland giving the distinct voice to Lemongrab that Moynihan had imagined. Kent Osborne later noted that voicing Lemongrab is taxing, and that when Roiland finishes delivering his lines, he is often covered in sweat. \\"Too Young\\" also featured the first use of Lemongrab's catchphrase, \\"Unacceptable!\\" Although it was used by Moynihan in the fourth season sequel to this episode, \\"You Made Me\\", Herpich has refused to place the line in his storyboards again for fear of overusing it. Peppermint Butler mentions that food comes from Mars; this was an ad lib on the part of Steve Little, who was instructed to talk randomly only so that he could be interrupted by Roiland. This accidental detail excited Moynihan, who thought that it would be over-analyzed on the Internet. To his disappointment, most fans seemed to ignore the detail. The idea to have Princess Bubblegum be a 13-year-old girl was first introduced in the second season episode \\"Mortal Recoil\\". The younger version of Bubblegum was voiced by Isabella Acres, who had previously played the role in \\"Mortal Recoil\\". According to Moynihan, there were initially \\"rumors\\" to keep Bubblegum young for several episodes, but eventually her 13-year-old version was relegated to only two appearances before she reverted to normal. Reception \\"Too Young\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on August 8, 2011. The episode was viewed by 2.089 million viewers and scored a 0.34 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year- old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.34 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Jake vs. Me-Mow DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first four seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete third season DVD on February 25, 2014. Ryan Thompson of Watch Play Read awarded the episode a 90%, calling it \\"the episode that [he has] been looking forward to this season.\\" He concluded that it was a fun episode to watch, but that he wished that the Finn and young-Bubblegum relationship could have been developed over the span of a few more episodes. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk argued that the episode was an example of the season \\"fleshing out the characters viewers have come to know and love\\" by elaborating on the relationship between Finn and Bubblegum. Foster praised the introduction of Lemongrab, writing that the episode \\"reveals a number of weird and sometimes paralyzingly funny quirks about the truly bizarre Earl of Lemongrab\\". Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club named \\"Too Young\\" as one of the ten additional episodes of the series that illustrates that \\"emotional complexity\\" lies \\"beneath Adventure Times weirdness\\". The decision to revert Princess Bubblegum to her original 18 year old self was met with contention on the Internet, with many fans noting that the decision merely returned the show to its second-season status quo. Ward expressed disregard for these opinions, and the episode's co-storyboarded Tom Herpich stated in the DVD commentary: \\"We're not out there to give people a hard time. We're out there to make quality entertainment.\\" Herpich and Rebecca Sugar also argued that the point of Bubblegum reverting to 18 was meant to be emphasize the idea of sacrifice, as well as the fact that the Candy Kingdom cannot function without her as ruler. The episode was later nominated for a 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short-format Animated Program.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Bert Youn, from a story by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on January 23, 2012. The episode guest stars Gregg Turkington as a talking bush. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn is scared by clown nurses who want to heal his foot, so he seeks out the magical tears of a cyclops. Along the way, he realizes that sometimes in life, one must make compromises so as to avoid hurting others. Ward had had the idea for \\"Another Way\\" since the first season, but had been unable to successfully break it in the writers room until the third season. During the episode's climax, Herpich attempted to storyboard the scene in order to convey maximum symbolism and thus get the point of the episode across to viewers. The episode has been met with both applause and criticism, with much attention being directed at the emphasis that feet receive in this episode. Plot After Finn and Jake break their toes during a stunt that involved jumping off of birds, the duo is taken care of by several horrifying clown nurses who insist on kissing their feet. Finn, disgusted by their antics, decides to trek to the forest and find fabled cyclops tears, which will heal any wound. Along the way, he meets resistance from many of the forest's denizens, who all insist that Finn follow their directions. After being told time and time again to proceed in a manner that is contrary to his wishes, Finn turns violent and accidentally injures a small creature named Rainy. Only then does Finn realize that his selfishness has brought pain to others. He rests on a hill and sings the song \\"Melons\\", which documents his errors. Finn's singing, however, awakens the cyclops, and Finn is able to subdue him and take his tears. Finn heals his toes and then runs throughout the forest, restoring life to those that he hurt. But Jake still insists on having his foot kissed, and tells Finn that we all have \\"our own ways\\". Production \\"Another Way\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Bert Youn, from a story developed by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. This was also the last episode storyboarded by Herpich and Youn. Ward had had the idea for the episode since the first season, but had been unable to successfully break it in the writers room until the third season. Youn, known for his penchant for drawing grotesque and exaggerated faces, designed the main clown nurse. The sequence during which Finn hallucinates that the head nurse's floating head is consuming him was toned down from its original form. Originally, the clown's face was shaded, and made heavy use of under lighting. The entire scene was inspired by Pink Elephants on Parade, a scene from the Disney animated feature film Dumbo in which Dumbo and Timothy Q. Mouse accidentally become intoxicated. The scene featuring the watermelons rolling down the hill was Herpich's attempt at pushing himself artistically, although he was slightly disappointed that it took \\"three solid days to board\\" but took only \\"half a second on the screen.\\" The joke concerning Rainy being run over by watermelons was inspired by a humorous video that Herpich saw in his youth. The episode guest stars Gregg Turkington, who is best known for his stand-up character Neil Hamburger; he played the talking bush. Maria Bamford voiced both the lead clown and the talking stump. Osborne voiced the character Pan, whose name originally was Brainstorm. Melissa Villase√±or voiced Rainy, Pan's wife. Symbolism In the episode, while Finn is singing his song about the melons, the camera focuses on the landscape before him, which features a river diverging into three branches. The middle path goes over a waterfall and lands on jagged rocks. The two on either side, however, \\"go down a gentle slope\\". Herpich explains in the DVD commentary for the episode that the middle path represents the path that Finn took, as it is dangerous and deadly. Despite the apparent differences in the river branches, all three merge in the end, symbolic that, despite the myriad ways of accomplishing something, a person can perform a task in many different ways \\"and end up in the same spot\\". Reception \\"Another Way\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on January 23, 2012. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Jake vs. Me- Mow DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first four seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete third season DVD on February 25, 2014. Dean Childers of TV Geek Army interpreted the emphasis placed on the clowns and the feet kissing in a Freudian light, arguing that ‚Äúthis week's story focuses on Finn's response to sexual exploration. They use the clowns as the metaphor. Finn finds sexuality scary and escapes into an adventure to avoid dealing with his feelings of anxiety.‚Äù In addition, he argued that the series took the trope that ‚Äúanything featuring clowns now is obligated to make them as freaky as possible‚Äù and ‚Äúmultiplie[d] it tenfold‚Äù. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called the episode \\"both wonderfully creative and funny once Finn storms off with his own agenda, but is one of the most bizarre and disturbing episodes of the show I've seen for the first five to ten minutes\\" due to its heavy use of clowns. A review from Nerdmelt Showroom noted that, \\"if you don‚Äôt like seeing clowns or injured trees, take a pass on this episode.\\" Doug Walker, star of the comedy webseries Nostalgia Critic, reviewed the episode as part of the That Guy with the Glasses web series. He noted that \\"it feels kind of like a return to form to the first season.\\" Jori Laws, an assistant on That Guy with the Glasses, expressed her disgust at the plot point involving the clowns kissing Finn and Jake's feet. Herpich himself also noted that he had a friend who was disturbed by the feet kissing in the episode.

The first Friedenberg church stood to the north of the Cingue Homme bridge on Highway 61. In 1851, a new church was built on the Frankenberg, south of the Friedenberg cemetery. A number of Lutheran Bavarians settled to the north of Perryville, but belonged to the Friedenberg church. By 1862, the Lutheran Bavarians were meeting in the Sandler House in Perryville for their Sunday services rather than making the trip to Friedenberg. In March, 1866, a number of them had formed a Schul-Gemeinde (a congregation for the purpose of setting up a school) for providing a Christian education in both German and English to their children. They also requested to be relinquished from the Friedenberg congregation for the purpose of founding their own church. At first, divine services and meetings were held in the Perry County Court House and in the old Methodist church to the north of the Monitor Building. In 1867, the first building was built which served both as church and school. Pastor Friedrich Besel of the Friedenberg congregation provided pastoral services until the congregation could find their own pastor. In 1869, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other States assigned reverend Chas H. Demetrio to serve the congregation in Perryville. In 1894, a new church was erected, with the old church serving as the parochial school. English services were introduced in 1921, and by 1963 services were being held in English-only.Lutz, Rev. Paul.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 2, 2012. The episode serves as a direct continuation of the third season episode \\"Incendium\\". The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn develops a crush on Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) and tries to get to know her, which proves difficult due to her destructive and uncontrollable power. The episode was the first to be storyboarded by Sanchez and Sugar; Sugar's previous storyboard partner, Adam Muto, helped clean up the episode's drawings. Sugar wrote a short rap for the episode, rapped by Andy Milonakis. Originally, Sugar wanted Milonakis to write his own, but he felt the song was of quality and he wanted to rap Sugar's version. \\"Hot to the Touch\\" was seen by 2.655 million viewers and marked a significant increase in ratings for the series. It received largely positive critical reviews, with reviewers from both The A.V. Club and Slate applauding the episode's emotional range. Plot Finn pursues Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), trying to explain to her that he does not want to hurt her. However, Flame Princess, confused by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent on turning it into her new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots. The two heroes descend on the Goblin Kingdom, and begin putting out the fire; this, in turn, hurts Flame Princess, both emotionally and physically, judging from her shedding of a single tear. Finn, horrified at the pain he has caused the object of his affections, exits his robot and calls for Flame Princess's attention, before crying. The tears alert Flame Princess that Finn is a \\"water elemental\\", and that the two will only hurt each other, due to the opposition of their natural states. Production \\"Hot to the Touch\\" featured the second major appearance of Flame Princess, voiced by Jessica DiCicco. \\"Hot to the Touch\\" was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. This was the first episode that Sugar and Sanchez worked on together; Sugar's previous partner Adam Muto served as the episode's creative director, and also helped clean up the episode's storyboards. Sugar was excited to get a chance to show how Flame Princess interacted in the Land of Ooo, because in \\"Incendium\\", she was only shown inside of her lantern. The line about Finn wanting to play BMO with Flame Princess was based on Sanchez's experiences with his high school girlfriend; he reasoned that, since Finn was younger, his ultimate idea of love would be to sit next to his love interest and play video games. The episode features Andy Milonakis reprising his role as N.E.P.T.R., a character that was last seen in the first season episode \\"What is Life?\\" The short rap \\"Working for the Master\\" that is sung by N.E.P.T.R. was written by Sugar. She had originally planned for her demo version to merely be a \\"filler\\" track, as she expected Milonakis to want to write his own rap. To her surprise, however, Milonakis enjoyed Sugar's lyrics and insisted that he perform her version. Sugar's father, Rob, later released her demo version on his YouTube channel. Series composer Tim Kiefer produced the song's instrumental. Inspired by Wu- Tang Clan's penchant for sampling, Kieffer took his music from the season one episode \\"What is Life?\\" and edited it substantially, creating the \\"clattery bumpin' beat\\" featured in the episode. Reception \\"Hot to the Touch\\" aired on Cartoon Network on April 2, 2012. The episode was seen by 2.655 million viewers. The episode also ranked as the number one telecast for all children demographics, according to Nielsen ratings. It also marked a 96 percent increase in ratings, when the numbers for \\"Hot to the Touch\\" were compared to the ratings for the same time period in 2011. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2014 DVD, Princess Day, which included 16 episodes from the series' second through sixth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a largely positive review, noting that \\"in the episode‚Äôs 10 minutes, the writers create an apt metaphor for pubescent dating, as Finn and FP struggle to make a relationship work.\\" He noted the symbolism inherent in making Flame Princess a fire elemental, writing that \\"fire is the perfect element for a hormonal teenage princess, and FP can‚Äôt control her emotions, burning everything in her path as she reacts to Finn‚Äôs advances.\\" Sava also complimented the return of N.E.P.T.R., as well as his short rap, which Sava called \\"a perfect little musical interlude at the midway point of the episode.\\" Mike Lechevaillier of Slate magazine, in a review of the fourth season, wrote that \\"it's frequently astonishing to observe the confidence and wide-ranging appeal with which Adventure Time unswervingly depicts the many stages of infatuation.\\" The reviewer highlighted \\"Hot to the Touch\\" as an example of such an example, noting that Flame Princess represents \\"an uncomplicated yet vastly pertinent metaphor for the hypothesis that the closer you cherish someone, the likelier they are to singe your soft exterior and the easier it is for them to affectionately melt your exposed heart.\\" Marc Snetiker of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode a \\"B\\", noting that \\"the season four premiere of this inspired 'toon about a boy and his precocious dog is as colorful, clever, and unpredictably funny as ever.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2012 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Hot to the Touch"},{"id":"42534113","text":"\\"Five Short Graybles\\" is the second episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. The episode was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 9, 2012. The episode guest stars Emo Philips as Cuber. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. This episode is a series of short stories‚Äîconcerning BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch), the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), and Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward)‚Äîall centered on a common theme of the five senses, hosted by a mysterious man named Cuber from the future. The episode's premise was conceived when Ward was forced to cut a scene involving a high-five from a previous script. Ward enjoyed the scene so much that he decided to write an entire episode based around high-fives. Originally, it was planned for live action footage of Ward to appear in the episode, introducing each clip. This, however, was later scrapped in favor of the character of Cuber. \\"Five Short Graybles\\", along with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2‚Äì11, 6-11, and 9-14 on Monday nights, according to Nielsen ratings, and Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club applauded the various elements that the show was able to include in only an 11-minute episode. Plot The episode begins with a futuristic character named Cuber (voiced by Emo Philips) announcing to the audience that they will be watching five short vignettes that are all unified by one theme. Cuber challenges the audience to then guess the theme. The first short focuses on BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who talks to itself in the mirror, pretending as if it is talking to another character called \\"Football\\". BMO insists that it is a real, living boy, and attempts to demonstrate this to Football by brushing its teeth and using the toilet. Unbeknownst to BMO, Finn and Jake are watching the activity from outside a window. The focus then shifts to Finn and Jake, who attempt to experience the ultimate high five. Eventually, Finn places himself in a catapult, and Jake stretches himself into a slingshot, and the two launch themselves across Ooo. The next vignette focuses on Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) as she tries to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms. The final vignette focuses on Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward) as she attempts to win a talent show by singing a song entitled \\"These Lumps\\". Before she can perform, however, a group of candy citizens steal her song. Lumpy Space Princess becomes enraged and throws a basketball into the audience, which hits an audience member and accidentally makes a basket in the process. Due to the impressiveness of this action, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) names her the winner. Just then, Finn and Jake collide in mid-air, producing a high five that reverberates across Ooo. The duo are named the winner, much to Lumpy Space Princess' chagrin. The episode comes to a close with Cuber revealing that the theme was the five senses: BMO saw Football in the mirror, Finn and Jake touched each other's hands, Princess Bubblegum made a tasty sandwich, Ice King smelled something foul, and Lumpy Space Princess heard music. Production The episode guest stars Emo Philips as Cuber. \\"Five Short Graybles\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, and Cole Sanchez, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter. This was the first episode that Page worked on for the series; he was so excited to be working on the series that after he finished the storyboard, he traveled to Hawaii as a personal reward. Sanchez storyboarded the scenes with Ice King, as well as the scenes with Lumpy Space Princesssections, he argued, that are thematically united because the characters are \\"being a little bit mean\\" to others. The episode can trace its genesis to a short, but humorous scene involving a high five that Ward had been forced to cut from an episode. Ward was unhappy about the edit, and later jokingly said via his Twitter that he would make an episode entirely about high-fives. Although Ward was being facetious at the time, the idea of using a high five as an overarching plot point was subsequently used in \\"Five Short Graybles\\". Originally, it was planned for live action footage of Ward to appear in the episode; he would have introduced each clip, serving as a framing device. This idea, however, was eventually vetoed. Herpich came up with the idea to replace Ward with a futuristic character named Cuber, whose dialogue would be mixed with odd and nonsensical words, implying that he was speaking a \\"dialect from thousand of years in the future\\". According to Herpich, the word \\"graybles\\" is a supposed distortion of the word \\"fables\\". Cuber was voiced by Emo Philips, a comedian known for his \\"offbeat [vocal] cadence and high-pitched conversational tone\\". Philips would later reprise his role for the fifth season episodes \\"Five More Short Graybles\\", \\"Another Five More Short Graybles\\", and the sixth season episode \\"Graybles 1000+\\". Every one of Philips's voice recording takes was so different that Nate Cash, one of the series' creative directors, was forced to piece together disparate recordings to make the final composition. The episode also contains the short song \\"These Lumps\\", sung by Lumpy Space Princess. Ward himself had a difficult time singing this song was because he was trying to both sing the song on pitch and retain Lumpy Space Princess's accent. Reception \\"Five Short Graybles\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on April 9, 2012. Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, the episodes helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2‚Äì11, 6-11, and 9-14 on Monday nights, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode first saw physical release as part of the eponymous 2012 DVD, Jake vs. Me-Mow, which included 16 episodes from the series' first four seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\", describing it as \\"very weird\\" and \\"bizarre\\". Sava wrote that it is \\"unbelievable that all of [the activity in the episode] happens in 10 minutes, which goes to show just how much material is packed into every episode of this series.\\" He also noted that Cuber revealing the uniting theme was \\"a reminder to all the adults in the audience that the show that‚Äôs making them laugh so hard is targeted to kids in grade school\\".

The episode was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 16, 2012. The episode guest stars both Bobcat Goldthwait and Susie Essman. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn must help a grumpy spider couple, whose names are Barb and Ed, reconcile before he and Jake are eaten. While storyboarding the episode, Castuera focused her attention on physical comedy. Moynihan, on the other hand, concentrated more on the emotional interactions between the characters, having been inspired by a past experience at couple's therapy. Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, this episode helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2‚Äì11, 6-11, and 9-14 on Monday nights. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club and Mike Lechevaillier of Slate magazine praising \\"Web Weirdos\\" for its themes. On the other hand, Moynihan has expressed some disdain for the episode, reasoning that it did not turn out the way he intended. Plot While walking in the woods, Jake begins performing acrobatic moves. Finn attempts to follow, and eventually the two get trapped in a massive spider web. The owners of the web, two large spiders named Ed (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait) and Barb (voiced by Susie Essman) return, bickering amongst themselves. The argument turns towards Barb's difficulty spinning webs, and she runs away. While Ed wraps Jake in a cocoon, Finn tries to offer relationship advice to Ed; Finn tells the spider to get a gift for his wife, and Ed runs off into the woods to find something. With the spiders distracted, Finn and Jake try to escape from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he presents to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake. Production \\"Web Weirdos\\" was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was \\"super-sitcomy\\" and \\"standard\\", but when Castuera and Moynihan began working on it, they took the story in a different direction. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Castuera argued that this episode is epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities, as her scenes focus mostly on physical comedy, whereas Moynihan's focus on emotion. For instance, the first half of the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) opens with Finn and Jake parkouring off of boulders and rubble, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses almost entirely on Barb and Ed's complicated relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that for him, the episode was based on the idea that you have to have empathy for your partner. The episode guest stars Bobcat Goldthwait and Susie Essman as Ed and Barb, respectively. The designs for the spiders are idiosyncratic, as they were purposely crafted by Castuera and Moynihan to differ from other types of cartoon spiders. Castuera later said that their designs reminded her of \\"stuff I find at thrift stores\\". Before the episode aired, Cartoon Network's standard and practices department took issue with the sound that plays when Barb secretes silk. Originally, the sound effect was \\"gooier [and] fartier\\", but this was later cut and replaced with a more tame sound effect. Two of the bugs that are trapped on the spider web with Finn and Jake are voiced by series storyboard artist Cole Sanchez and voice actor Tom Kenny. Reception Jesse Moynihan, the co-storyboarder of this episode, was unsatisfied with his work on this episode. \\"Web Weirdos\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on April 16, 2012. Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, this episode helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2‚Äì11, 6-11, and 9-14 on Monday nights, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode first saw physical release as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\", arguing that the importance of communication in a relationship is paramount, and an extremely important lesson for the young children who watch Adventure Time to learn. He thus complimented \\"Web Weirdos\\" for exploring this topic through the idiosyncratic tale of two married but ultimately unhappy spiders, calling this decision one of \\"the reason[s] why Adventure Time has such crossover appeal\\". Sava also complimented the performances of both Essman and Goldthwait, noting that the two \\"make a great pair, capturing the stakes of the couple‚Äôs fight without sacrificing the comedy of the situation.\\" Mike Lechevaillier of Slate magazine, in a review of the fourth season, argued that the episodealong with many other fourth season episodes that focus on love and infatuation \\"present[s] determinedly adult interrelations through the eyes of the inexperienced Finn\\". In particular, he noted that \\"Web Weirdos\\" revolves around complicated themes like the nature of failing relationships and unexpected pregnancy. Ultimately, Lechevaillier compared and contrasted the episode with the following episode \\"Dream of Love\\", noting that both deal with relationships in different ways, \\"yet do so with such originality, humbleness, and poise that any viewer, from age six to 60, can find something to identify with.\\" Moynihan later expressed dissatisfaction with the resulting episode; he felt that, while he took creative risks with the episode, his efforts fell flat. In an online interview, he explained, \\"I think Ako's parts are funny, but everything I wrote in the episode played out in a way that I didn't expect. It's the one episode I've worked on that I really feel didn't do anything I intended.\\" Note: Information taken from Jesse Moynihan's verified account.

While there, they discover that Tree Trunks has entered into a relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by Ron Lynch). Finn asks Tree Trunks if she would be willing to make apple pie for Princess Bubblegum's musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. During the performance, Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable. After the concert, the two are told to stop displaying their affection in public. However, try as they might, they are unable to restrain their love for one another. As a last-ditch effort, Finn and Jake physically separate and isolate the two. Distressed, both fall into a depression and perform the song \\"Dream of Love\\", which expresses their sadness. The song is so moving that both Finn and Jake allow Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig to be reunited. Their relationship still manages to disgust people, although Finn and Jake are no longer worried about how Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig behave. Production The episode guest stars Ron Lynch as Mr. Pig. \\"Dream of Love\\" was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. Ward later admitted in the DVD commentary for the episode that while he and the show's storyline writers had fun developing the premise to \\"Dream of Love\\", the finalized episode was somewhat \\"weird\\" and \\"gross\\", due to the excessive amount of kissing between Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig. Ron Lynch reprises his role as Mr. Pig in the episode; after production of \\"Apple Thief\\" was finished, Ward insisted that Mr. Pig to come back because he felt that both the character and Lynch's voice acting were funny. The titular song was written by McHale.

Both episodes' stories were developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. Originally airing on Cartoon Network on April 30, 2012, both episodes feature the return of Martin Olson as Hunson Abadeer. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\", Finn and Jake discover that they are trapped in the Nightosphere, a hellish dimension ruled by Hunson Abadeer, Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, although they cannot seem to remember how they arrived. \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" features Finn and Jake discovering that Hunson Abadeer has turned Marceline into a giant demon. The duo manage to save Marceline. \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" features two songs: \\"Not Just Your Little Girl\\" and \\"Political Rap\\". The latter of the two, which went on to become particularly popular with fans of the series on the Internet, was written by Moynihan and intended for the episode \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\". Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, the episodes helped the network rank number one in a number of demographics on the night of April 30. Both episodes received largely positive critical reviews. Plot =\\"Return to the Nightosphere\\"= Finn and Jake awake in a prison cell full of bananas, confused and unaware of how they arrived at their location. A demonic prison guard tells them that they are in the Nightosphere, the hellish realm ruled by Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson). The two set off to locate Marceline's father and navigate back to their home dimension. Traversing the Nightosphere, Finn and Jake learn that they need to seek an audience with Hunson Abadeer if they want to leave. Eventually, they reach a line composed of demons who seek petitions from their demonic overlord. Just then, a storm cloud appears in a mist, slaying all the demons present; Finn and Jake barely escape death. Afterwards, the two follow the cloud to a castle. There, the cloud condenses into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While running through the castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, been transformed into a hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal. =\\"Daddy's Little Monster\\"= In the tree fort, Jake charges his cell phone and discovers footage that he filmed prior to Finn and him waking up in a jail cell in the Nightosphere; apparently, Marceline had invited Finn and Jake to party in the Nightosphere, wherein she was given a demonic amulet by Hunson, which turned her into a being of pure evil. Determined to save Marceline, Finn and Jake disguise themselves as demons and sneak back into the Nightosphere by creating a portal that sends them to the seat of government for Marceline's regime. Marceline, in her evil demon form, listens to the requests of her subjects, often ignoring what they seek and instead punishing them with macabre torture. Finn and Jake are spotted by Marceline, who gives chase. After narrowly avoiding their demonic friend, the duo run into the now-benign Hunson Abadeer, who explains that he only wanted Marceline to follow in his footsteps and rule the hellish realm. Finn and Jake later rile up the apathetic demon masses by performing a \\"political rap\\", which instigates anarchy. Finn manages to rip the amulet off of Marceline, which renders her unconscious. To escape the rebellious demon masses, Finn puts the amulet on and pushes Marceline and Jake through the portal. Hunson Abadeer arrives on the scene and rips the amulet from Finn's neck, sending Finn falling back through the portal. Marceline is initially disappointed in her father for tricking her into ruling the Nightosphere to make him proud, but they reconcile when Hunson reassures Marceline that he is proud of her, no matter what she does, and that he actually enjoys Finn and Jake. Production \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\" (which was originally known as \\"Finn and Jake Go to Hell\\" during early production) was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, whereas \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Cole Sanchez. The stories for both episodes were developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne, and both were directed by Larry Leichliter, with Nick Jennings serving as art director. Nate Cash served as creative director for \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\" and Adam Muto served as creative director for \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\". For \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\", Moynihan designed a long pan for the shot in which Finn and Jake survey the entirety of the Nightosphere. Moynihan enjoyed designing these sorts of ambitious, long pans, and he had created a similar one for the second season episode \\"Death in Bloom\\". Unfortunately, during production, his drawing got lost three times, although it was finally located. As for \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\", an original version of the episode featured Hunson Abadeer pretending to be sick so that Marceline would feel sorry and take over his job. However this plot was later discarded. The beginning of the episode features Finn and Jake reviewing footage captured on Jake's camera phone. Ward noted that it was difficult to keep the action lively, while also framing the scene as if it were stationary phone footage. \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" features several songs, including \\"Not Just Your Little Girl\\", written by Sugar. Sugar and Sanchez originally tried writing the song‚Äîwhich was originally to be called the \\"Cone Zone\\"‚Äîtogether, but Sugar eventually completely rewrote it. When it came time to storyboard the episode, Sanchez with the help of former storyboard artist and then-creative director Adam Muto, storyboarded the scene, and Ward asked Sugar to record a quick demo of the song for reference. She filmed herself recording the demo, but jokingly noted that she asked \\"Pen and Cole to face the other way\\" out of embarrassment. The political rap featured in \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\", written by Moynihan, was originally intended for \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\", but was cut for time. Sugar, however, liked the song so much that she insisted it be added to \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\". Moynihan was pleased with the largely positive critical reception the rap had from fans of the series. Martin Olson, the father of voice actress Olivia Olson, reprises his role as Hunson Abadeer in \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\" and \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\"; Olson had previously appeared in the second season premiere \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\" and the third season episode \\"Memory of a Memory\\". The episode was also the first to give a name to Marceline's father: Hunson Abadeer. According to Moynihan, the name was inspired by the name that his brother had given their family's car when they were growing up. The two later used it for a band that only recorded one song. To create the demonic effect of Marceline talking while possessed with the amulet, Olivia Olson and her father were required to say their lines in tandem. She later explained: \\"We were going back-and-forth, line to line ‚Ä¶ We were screaming back and forth at each other, and trying to match pitches and stuff. Then, hearing the after product of both of our voices blended together was pretty fun.\\" Reception \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\" and \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on April 30, 2012. Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, the episodes helped make the network the number one television destination for boys aged 2‚Äì11, 6‚Äì11, and 9‚Äì14 on Monday nights, according to Nielsen ratings. The episodes first saw physical release as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club awarded both \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\" and \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" an \\"A\\", noting that, \\"If the last few episodes of Adventure Time ‚Ä¶ struck anyone as being a little short on adventure, or, at least, action, tonight‚Äôs epic two-parter went a long way toward making up for it.\\" He applauded the installments embracement of dark humor, as well as its fixation with striking visual designs, describing the titular Nightosphere as \\"a goofed-up Hieronymous Bosch landscape\\". In regards to \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\", Dyess-Nugent noted that the high-point was the \\"freestyle political rap\\" that Finn and Jake ad-lib to get the demons to help them. In an interview with The Mary Sue on August 2, 2013, Olivia Olson claimed that both \\"Return to the Nightosphere\\" and \\"Daddy's Little Monster\\" were the most fun episodes for her to record, largely due to the manner in which she and her father had to record their lines in tandem.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 30, 2012. The episode guest stars Eric Bauza as a bear and features Ward voicing the Lich-possessed snail. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, A bear befriends Finn, but Jake thinks he is trying to steal Finn's identity. At the end of the episode, Finn kindly gives the Enchridion to the bear, believing he wishes to learn how to be a hero himself; however, it is revealed that the bear is secretly working for the Lich. The episode's ending sets up the fourth season finale \\"The Lich\\". Other fourth season episodes were supposed to have had similar kinds of hints sprinkled throughout that also set up the season for the finale, although this did not come to pass. The episode received largely positive critical reviews and ranked as the number one telecast in its timeslot among kids aged 2 to 11, and in all boy demographics, according to Nielsen ratings Plot While partying with Princess Bubblegum and her subjects in the woods, Finn and Jake meet a friendly bear (voiced by Eric Bauza) who follows them home. The creature begins to copy everything that Finn does; Finn finds the behavior amusing, but Jake finds it creepy. Later that night, Jake discovers the bear, dressed as Finn, copying his mannerisms and sayings; Jake thus concludes that the creature is trying to replace Finn. However, he is unable to prove it to Finn. The next day, after Finn leaves to take BMO to soccer practice, the bear proceeds to eat Finn‚Äôs special ‚ÄúFinn cakes‚Äù. Jake decides to set the bear up by filming him eating the cakes. However, upon viewing the footage Finn simply becomes upset at Jake for not stopping the creature. However, both notice a sign, claiming that there will be a party in the forest hosted by Finn. The two rush to the woods to see the bear, clearly disguised as Finn, partying with Bubblegum and the candy people. Finn, finally angered, reproaches the bear, who runs off into the woods, sobbing. Finn, realizing the bear was copying Finn because he idolized him, apologizes to him and gives him the Enchiridion as a way to make amends. However, the coda of the episode features the bear taking the Enchiridion to the Lich-possessed snail, setting up the events for the fourth season finale, ‚ÄúThe Lich‚Äù. Production \\"In Your Footsteps\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. This episode marked Herpich and Page's first official board together, as Cole Sanchez had assisted the two in storyboarding \\"Five Short Graybles\\" as a way to acclimate Page to the Adventure Time process. According to Herpich, the scene where Jake hears the bear pretending to be Finn in the night is stylistically similar to a scene in the third season episode \\"Conquest of Cuteness\\" where Finn and Jake hear a voice in the night. Herpich later noted that he tried to storyboard the scene in \\"In Your Footsteps\\" in a way so as to not copy what he had previously done for the show. The ending of the episode sets up the fourth season finale \\"The Lich\\". Herpich noted that there were originally supposed to have been other episodes peppered throughout the season that would have hinted at the finale, but in the end, only the denouement of this episode suggested what was to come. The Lich-possessed Snail was voiced by Ward. Reception \\"In Your Footsteps\\" aired on Cartoon Network on May 7, 2012. The episode ranked as the number one telecast in its timeslot among kids aged 2 to 11, and in all boy demographics, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode first saw physical release as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\", calling the installment a \\"breather episode, showing Finn and Jake relaxing before they head off on whatever adventure is waiting for them next.\\" However, he also pointed out that the episode ended on a cliffhanger, something that rarely happened in Adventure Time at the time of its airing. Sava also called the scene wherein the oft-spotted snail speaks \\"a landmark Adventure Time moment\\". Ultimately, Sava concluded that \\"the cliffhanger introduces a slew of intriguing possibilities for Adventure Time, and it would definitely be ambitious for the series to try a serialized story in the midst of the wacky comedy.\\" Mike Lechevaillier of Slate magazine, in a review of the fourth season, called the episode \\"charming\\", and applauded the exploration of Jake's character. He compared the episode favorably to the third season installment \\"No One Can Hear You\\" in terms of its focus on \\"Jake's slippery sanity\\", and he applauded DiMaggio's voice acting, writing that his \\"delivery of Jake's panic-stricken sessions is a true testament to the actor's degree of successive theatrical refinement.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on May 28, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake discover that the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) has been stealing princesses' body parts to build a bride, Princess Monster Wife. She is so horribly deformed that Finn and Jake cannot view her directly without fainting; eventually, Princess Monster Wife realizes that she is a monster and returns the stolen body parts. Ward explained that \\"Princess Monster Wife\\" was conceptualized to be both a sad and funny story at the same time. The episode featured a song, \\"Something Special\\", written by McHale, that was inspired by the 1992 song \\"A Whole New World\\", from the animated feature film Aladdin. According to a report by Nielsen, the episode ranked as the number one telecast among all boy demographic groups, and it also received mostly positive critical reviews; Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club and Dean Childers of TV Geek Army both appreciated the focus on the Ice King. However, Justin Remer of DVD Talk disliked the episode because he felt its story did not translate well onto the screen. Plot The princesses of Ooo all wake up to find various parts of their bodies missing. They go to Finn and Jake, who promise to help them. Suspecting that the culprit is Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), they confront him. At first, he denies the allegations; he then shows them his new bride, Princess Monster Wife (voiced in tendem by Hynden Walch, Pendleton Ward, and Steve Little), a being made up of the stolen body parts. Horrified, Finn and Jake faint. Princess Monster Wife inquires as to who the two are, and the Ice King lies, saying that they are their children. Ice King, Princess Monster Wife, and an unconscious Finn and Jake all have dinner. Afterwards, Princess Monster Wife confesses to Ice King that she feels different, to which the Ice King responds by singing \\"Something Special\\"; he argues that she is all he needs. After Finn and Jake regain consciousness only to faint due to Princess Monster Wife's hideousness, she beings to doubt her normality, leading the Ice King to throw a fashion show. All of the kingdom's penguins are in attendance, but one of them vomits due to Princess Monster Wife's ugliness. Distraught, Princess Monster Wife locks herself in her room. The Ice King desperately tries to show her that she is beautiful by revealing that he made her out of the parts of the princesses he found most attractive. Princess Monster Wife is disturbed by this notion and eventually decides to return the stolen body parts, until she herself does not exist. However, the Ice King is not moved, and angrily bemoans that she \\"gave away all [his] stuff.\\" Production Patrick McHale. The story for \\"Princess Monster Wife\\" was developed by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Ward revealed that with \\"Princess Monster Wife\\" he was hoping to craft a story that was both \\"super sad and intense, [but] tickles your funny bone at the same time.\\" Ward further explained that the eponymous character was analogous to himself, noting, \\"I'm made out of broken parts ‚Ä¶ but you can turn [those parts] into something worth displaying.\\" To voice Princess Monster Wife, Ward, Walch, and Little had to record each of their lines in tandem, mimicking the tones of one another. The storyboard for \\"Princess Monster Wife\\" was created by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, and the episode was directed by Larry Leichliter. According to Ward, Youn's storyboarding idiosyncrasies are especially noticeable in this episode; several times, he drew Finn with gums, something that most storyboard artists do not do. During the episode's DVD commentary, fellow storyboard artist Jesse Moynihan argued that Youn employed \\"visual vocabulary [borrowed] from anime\\", which informed how he drew the characters. The song that the Ice King sings to Princess Monster Wife is called \\"Something Special\\". According to McHale, the song's writer, the main inspiration for it was the 1992 song \\"A Whole New World\\", from the animated feature film Aladdin. Note: Information taken from Patrick McHale's official Twitter account. McHale recorded a demo track of the song, featuring himself accompanied on guitar; during the recording of this demo, however, his cat kept meowing loudly. The crew found this funny, and so, in the finished episode, Gunter the penguin's cat offspring can be heard meowing several times. McHale later released his demo for \\"Something Special\\" via Twitter on June 15, 2012. Note: Information taken from Patrick McHale's official Twitter account. Originally, it was planned for Princess Monster Wife to join in with the Ice King and sing the song as a duet. Hynden Walch actually recorded her part, and the production staff intended for Ward and Little to record their lines as well. However, in the end, the crew decided it was funnier for the Ice King to sing both parts.Muto, Adam. Spring.me. Archived from the original on September 17, 2014. Retrieved September 17, 2014. \\"They recorded takes of ['Something Special'] with Hynden Walch singing the female part of the song [...] The intention was that Steve Little and Pen would sing that part too.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on May 14, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn goes through a werewolf-like transformation after an encounter with an Alpha Hug Wolf, turning into a Beta Hug Wolf. It is up to Jake to break the curse and turn Finn back to normal. The episode came together after Ward drew several werewolf-inspired creatures with a fondness for hugging. The music that accompanies the climax was scored by Casey James Basichis to convey Finn's transformation through music. \\"Hug Wolf\\" received largely positive critical reviews, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club arguing that the episode was an analogy for the more serious topic of rape. Plot While attempting to destroy the Tree of Blight, Finn is accidentally hugged by a wolf-like creature. Later that night, after he begins to show signs of a fever, as well as a new-found penchant for hugging, Jake urges Finn to get some sleep. Ominously, in the morning, while walking through the Candy Kingdom, several citizens reveal that Finn appeared before them during the night and aggressively hugged them. Finn and Jake journey to the library and read about the \\"hugwolf\\", a lycanthropic creature that turns into a wolf in the presence of a full moon and hugs its victims. The curse is spread from higher-level \\"alpha\\" hugwolves, to lower-lever \\"beta\\" creatures, of which Finn is now. That night, Jake and BMO try to restrain Finn, but he transforms, breaks free, and goes on a hugging spree in the Candy Kingdom. The next morning, the citizens of the kingdom imprison Finn in the dungeon. Jake in turn leads an angry mob in search of the alpha hugwolf. By tempting Cinnamon Bun with a hug, Finn escapes after he transforms. Meanwhile, the alpha creature corners Jake and his mob, but Finn shows up. Finn and the alpha wolf start hugging each other, which seems to act as a cure for the condition. Finn is returned to his former state, as is the alpha, who is revealed to be a beautiful woman. The episode ends with the woman turning into the Tree of Blight, thus scaring Jake. Production The music for the episode's climax made use of 8bit Nintendo Entertainment System synths that were mixed with distortion. \\"Hug Wolf\\" was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode came together after Ward drew several werewolf-inspired creatures with a fondness for hugging. He felt that the resulting story would be humorous, and the episode came into being. In addition, Ward himself voiced the father of the gumdrop girl Finn almost attacks during one of his hugging sprees. All of the lines were improvised while Ward was in the recording booth. The music that accompanies the climactic showdown between Finn and the Alpha Hugwolf was composed by Casey James Basichis. The composer thought up several novel ways to convey Finn's transformation through music, including \\"burying 8bit NES synths in distortion, playing guitar with my girlfriend‚Äôs many fur coats, [and] screaming into pillows\\". He eventually settled on using fur coats to produce a \\"warm, woolly\\" sound. The music's beat was crafted to sound like \\"unrelenting static electricity\\". Reception \\"Hug Wolf\\" aired on Cartoon Network on May 14, 2012. The episode ranked as the number one telecast of the week among boys aged 6 to 11, and 2 to 11, and it was also the number one telecast of the day among children aged 6 to 11, and 2 to 11. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2014 DVD, The Suitor, which included 16 episodes from the series' first five seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", arguing that the episode was an analogy for the more serious topic of rape. He concluded that, \\"There‚Äôs no significant world building or a talking snail cliff hanger, but 'Hug Wolf' is a bizarre, clever episode with some great one-liners and visual gags.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on June 4, 2012. The episode guest stars Graham Linehan's children, Wendy and Henry. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) begins to fear for her mortality, and creates an eternal sphinx named Goliad to be her successor. Things go awry, however, when the sphinx turns against Bubblegum. Linehan's children, Wendy and Henry, were brought on to voice Goliad and Stormo, respectively, after Ward saw video of them impersonating Adventure Time characters. The episode received largely positive critical reviews, and was later nominated for an Annie Award for \\"Storyboarding in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production\\" at the 2013 award ceremony, although the episode did not win. Plot Princess Bubblegum summons Finn and Jake and explains that, due to her recent brush with death, she has become aware of her own mortality. Reasoning that she may not always be around for her subjects, she reveals that she has created a candy sphinx named Goliad, from her own DNA. Finn and Jake insist that Bubblegum let them teach it about the world and what it means to be a leader, and she lets them, exhausted from her work. Finn and Jake take Goliad to a preschool, where the kids are unruly and destructive. After Jake gets angry and aggressively yells at them, Goliad begins to get the wrong impression of what it means to be a leader; she explains to Finn and Jake that, were she to control everyone, the world would be perfect. Goliad then reveals that her head conceals a third eye, which she uses to psychically control Finn. Once Bubblegum learns that Goliad has gone rogue, she rushes off to solve the problem, leaving Finn and Jake to momentarily hold off the almost-omnipotent sphinx. Nearly bested, Finn and Jake are about to be beaten when Bubblegum returns with a new sphinx named Stormo, made from Finn's DNA. Stormo, being heroic like Finn, sacrifices his life by engaging in eternal psychic combat with Goliad. The episode ends with Finn wishing Stormo a happy birthday. Production The episode features Graham Linehan's (pictured) children, Wendy and Henry, as the voices of Goliad and Stormo respectively. \\"Goliad\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story developed by Herpich, series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. \\"Goliad\\" marked the first time that Herpich storyboarded an episode that he developed on his own. Originally, the episode was inspired by a time Herpich's father yelled at him and made him angry. However, once he brought it to the writing staff, significant revisions took place, and the resultant plot changed substantially. On the DVD commentary, both Herpich and storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar noted that the episode was largely an exploration of absolute control and free will. The episode features Graham Linehan's daughter Wendy as the voice of Goliad, and his son Henry as Stormo. Ward approached Linehan about casting his children after Linehan had retweeted a video made by Wendy and Henry that featured them impersonating various Adventure Time characters. During the recording session, Linehan was being directed over the phone by the producers of Adventure Time, and he in turn gave direction to his children. Linehan had planned to write a follow-up episode about Goliad and Stormo, and while he sent some preliminary ideas to Ward, this episode was never made. Reception \\"Goliad\\" aired on Cartoon Network on June 4, 2012. Together with other episodes of Cartoon Network programming, the episode helped the network rank as the number one in terms of boys aged 2 to 11, 6 to 11, and 9 to 14, for the week. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Jake vs. Me-Mow DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first four seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"A‚Äì\\". After lauding the strengths of the series as a whole, Handlen noted, \\"I‚Äôll admit to being something at a loss as to how to review an episode, but at least I‚Äôm pretty sure 'Goliad' was a good one.\\" Despite this, he felt that it \\"didn‚Äôt quite come up to the level of glorious madness that the best episodes achieve\\". Handlen called one sequence‚Äîwherein Finn tries to prevent himself from thinking of Princess Bubblegum's plan, lest the mind-reading Goliad be able to best him‚Äî\\"the best gag in the episode\\", largely due to the humorous visuals included in the scene. Ultimately, Handlen concluded that the reveal that Stormo was made from Finn's DNA was an example of \\"a straight-faced-but-still-totally-ridiculous episode\\" being able to embrace a small moment of heart. The episode was later nominated for an Annie Award for \\"Storyboarding in an Animated Television/Broadcast Production\\" at the 2013 award ceremony, although the episode did not win.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on June 18, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Ward) goes undercover working for Finn and Jake in order to do research for her tell-all memoir about men. She eventually learns that Finn is selfless, which makes him \\"hot on the inside\\". For inspiration, Sugar and Sanchez watched poorly made romantic comedies with Osborne during their lunch breaks. \\"Gotcha!\\" was watched by 2.392 million viewers, and received largely positive critical reviews, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club applauding the episode's dialogue and voice acting. Plot After boasting to Turtle Princess (voiced by Steve Little) that no man is immune to her beauty, Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by Pendleton Ward) promises to seduce Finn and write a tell-all book about her experience. After convincing Finn and Jake to allow her to be their \\"adventure secretary\\", Lumpy Space Princess tries to woo Finn. However, most of what she interprets as signs of successful seduction are mundane aspects of Finn's altruistic character, such as his willingness to fetch her old spaghetti for dinner. The next day, Finn, Jake, and Lumpy Space Princess journey to the Mystery Mountains to investigate the Loch of Phantoms. After crossing the water, the trio enter into a cave system, where they find a mirror-like portal. Lumpy Space Princess accidentally falls through, wherein she is attacked by phantom versions of Finn. The real Finn, however, manages to break through using his sword, and Finn and Jake destroy the phantoms. Lumpy Space Princess, realizing that Finn is \\"beautiful on the inside\\" due to his altruism and heroic character, completely rewrites her book, much to Turtle Princess's excitement. Production \\"Gotcha!\\" was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter. For inspiration, Sugar and Sanchez watched poorly made romantic comedies with Osborne during their lunch breaks. While Sanchez felt that these movies were \\"inspiring\\", Sugar felt that they were \\"draining\\". While the episode was being storyboarded, Ward was under stress because his family was in town. When Sugar explained that she wanted to make Lumpy Space Princess realize that she was attracted to Finn, Ward‚Äîbeing extremely stressed out‚Äîuncharacteristically protested, declaring: \\"They're both me. I'm Lumpy Space Princess and Finn.\\" He did not want any form of romance to come between the two characters due to his personal connection with them. However, when Ward was recording his lines, he felt that the story and dialogue was funny; he later noted he was just having an off day. The lake and the mirrors villains were Dungeons & Dragons inspired, according to Ward. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he applauded Sugar's application of them. She, in turn noted that she \\"love[s] mirror enemies ‚Ä¶ and doppelg√§nger enemies of all kinds.\\" During the scenes taking place inside the mirror room, Sugar made sure the mirrors were reflecting everything properly, which took extra work. Because the word \\"lumps\\" were used over and over in the original storyboard, Ward and the crew began to think of new, unique colloquialism for Lumpy Space Princess to use when referring to her lumps. One of the words substituted was \\"cobras\\". Reception \\"Gotcha!\\" aired on Cartoon Network on June 18, 2012. The episode was watched by 2.392 million viewers, and scored a 0.33 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, according to Nielsen ratings.

It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B\\". Sava felt that the episode's final line of dialogue‚Äîfeaturing Jake telling Lumpy Space Princess that she's wearing garbage, only for Lumpy Space Princess to respond, \\"Gotcha!\\"‚Äî\\"perfectly encapsulates the tone of this episode\\". Lumpy Space Princess, according to Sava, is \\"adorable but simultaneously off-putting\\", which \\"translates to lots of laughs\\". Sava lauded Ward and Little's voice work, noting that \\"the repetition of their catchphrase 'Hey, girl!' is the episode‚Äôs best running gag, if only because Pendleton Ward and Steve Little give the characters such great voices.\\" Finally, Sava was appreciative of the background music featured in the episode, writing, \\"The quick little bursts of music this week set the tone for the scenes really well, especially the Bon Iver-like final number as LSP has her final kinda-revelation.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2012 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Gotcha!

The episode guest stars Donald Faison as Baby-Snaps. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake are sent in to rescue the hostages from a rogue cookie named Baby-Snaps. Things get complicated when Jake begins to sympathize with him; he learns that Baby-Snaps only wants to be a princess. The episode received largely positive critical reviews, with a Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club calling it one of the fourth season's strongest episodes. The episode was later nominated for \\"Best Animated Television Production For Children\\" at the 2013 Annie Awards, although the episode did not win. It was also screened at the 2013 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. Plot The episode begins in media res, with Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum at the scene of a hostage situation. The perpetrator, a chocolate chip cookie named Baby-Snaps (voiced by Donald Faison) and his henchman demands Bubblegum's crown in exchange for the prisoners. Jake, disguised as a milkman, and Finn, disguised as his shadow, successfully enter the building. Finn sneaks off to take care of Baby-Snaps's chocolate chip accomplices, while Jake tries to reason with the cookie. Jake soon learns that Baby-Snaps grew up in an orphanage, and that his life changed when he first met Princess Bubblegum, due to the happiness she brought to the children. However, after a young Baby-Snaps told her that he too wanted to be a princess, she laughed at him. This in turn, caused him to resent her. Jake, sympathetic to Baby-Snaps's plight, helps him escape, although the two are pursued by the Banana Guards. Cornered on the precipice of a canyon, Baby-Snaps realizes the futility of his flight, thanks Jake, and jumps over the edge. However, instead of dying, he is merely fragmented into several pieces. Baby-Snaps is later put back together and institutionalized. At the hospital, Finn and Jake arrive and, with the approval of Princess Bubblegum, Jake gives Baby-Snaps a grass crown so that he can be the princess of the Grasslands. Production The episode guest stars Donald Faison, who voices Princess Cookie. \\"Princess Cookie\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. Donald Faison guest stars in this episode, playing the part of Baby-Snaps. Faison later noted in an interview that his experience with Adventure Time was extremely positive; DiMaggio came and read lines with him, which Faison called \\"really cool because usually when you do voiceover work it's just you in a box and a director and a writer and whoever else is in another room.\\" He also revealed that he has received a large amount of positive feedback for his role, and that he would love to reprise his character if given the chance. Likewise, the writing and production staff of Adventure Time were pleased with both Faison's performance and his amiability, with Herpich noting he was \\"so, so nice.\\" Reception \\"Princess Cookie\\" aired on Cartoon Network on June 25, 2012. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on July 16, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake play Card Wars, a tabletop game. But things take a turn for the worse when Jake becomes overly competitive. It had originally been planned to produce the episode during the first season because McHale and Ward were actively playing immersive, worldbuilding games. The episode received largely positive critical reviews, with Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club applauding how the eponymous game lampooned Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, and Risk. Due to the episode's success, a mobile app and a physical version of the eponymous game have been released. Plot Jake explains to Finn that his girlfriend, Lady Rainicorn will not play his favorite card game, ‚Äò‚ÄôCard Wars‚Äô‚Äô; Finn, however, agrees to play with Jake, and the duo agree that the winner (who will be crowned \\"the Cool Guy\\") will be rewarded with soda, whereas the loser (who will be dubbed \\"the Dweeb\\") will be forced to drink a terrible concoction including soda, coffee grounds, and kimchi, among other things. With the stakes set, the game begins. Jake explains the complex and arcane rules to Finn, who quickly falls asleep. However, once the board game component begins, Finn gains the upper hand, largely by ‚Äúflooping‚Äù (or ‚Äúactivating‚Äù) his Pig card. Time and time again, Jake tries to kill Finn's Pig, only for his plans to backfire. Soon, however, Jake becomes angry and aggressive, and Finn is warned by BMO (voiced by Niki Yang) that if Jake loses, he will become bitter and depressed. Finn, therefore, decides to purposely lose the game for Jake's sake. Once the game resumes, Finn purposely sacrifices his all-powerful Pig, allowing Jake to defeat him. Finn is forced to drink the disgusting liquid concoction, but manages to trick Jake into trying it. The episode ends with the two brothers happily sharing the nasty drink, seemingly on friendly terms again. Production \\"Card Wars\\" was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter. During the middle of the episode, both Finn and Jake are depicted with grotesque, off-model faces, a trademark of Youn's storyboarding style. These faces necessitated lead character designer Andy Ristaino to drew several unique, key frames, colloquially known as \\"Bert Youn Specials\\". Ristaino revealed that he drew at least three of these faces for the episode. Ward later noted, in the DVD commentary for the third season episode \\"Another Way\\", that \\"Card Wars\\" featured Youn's most extreme and exaggerated faces. Storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar noted that the idea behind this episode had been in development for a long time. Originally, it had been planned to make the episode during the first season because McHale and Ward were actively playing immersive, worldbuilding games. However, it took until the fourth season for the episode to be made. Nate Cash served as the episode's creative director. He messaged both Youn‚Äîwho, at the time, was in South Korea‚Äîand Ward via Facebook to inform the two that he enjoyed the episode so much. Many of the scenes with BMO were inspired by Erik Fountain and Cash's experiences skateboarding. Cash in particular posed out all of the moves to make them faithful to real life. Reception \\"Card Wars\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on July 16, 2012. On the night it aired, it ranked as the number one telecast of the day in the Nielsen ratings among boys aged 2‚Äì11. It also ranked first in its timeslot among children ages 2‚Äì11. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\" and wrote that, on the surface, the episode \\"has got to be an instant contender for the most low-key Adventure Time ever\\", noting that there are no guest stars and that the action is centered entirely in Finn and Jake's Tree Fort. However, he applauded the episode, arguing that it \\"absolutely nails the insanity of trying to jump into an overcomplicated, impenetrable game with a much more seasoned competitor\\". Wilkins compared the titular Card Wars game to Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, and Risk, pointing out that Card Wars \\"byzantine rules and gleefully baffling terminology\\" emulates and lampoons the aforementioned games. Ultimately, Wilkins concluded that the episode was successful because of \\"how real this all feels\\". Tyler Foster of DVD Talk named the episode as one of the \\"highlights\\" of the Fionna and Cake DVD, witing, \\"As the show often feels like a big riff on Dungeons and Dragons, this spoof of tabletop gaming is full of absurd yet deeply familiar moments: the endless rule-reading, the surprise triumphs, and the seething rage.\\" The episode was later nominated for and won a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing: Sound Effects, Foley, Dialogue and ADR Animation in Television. Merchandise The popularity of the episode has led Cartoon Network to market several versions of the game. =Mobile app= On February 16, 2014, a mobile app version of the game developed by Kung Fu Factory was released that expanded the original premise of the show to create additional storylines, characters, creatures and environments while further developing the gameplay rules. The app itself dismayed critics due to its in-app purchases, however, proved popular on the app store rising to #1 in the top paid apps, with review aggregation site Metacritic awarding the game a 73, denoting \\"mixed or average reviews\\". On June 18, 2015 an expansion was released for the iOS app that featured Fiona and Cake along with new gameplay features. =Physical version= A physical version of the game was released on February 19, 2014 by Cryptozoic Entertainment. This version, made for two players, features 80 different cards, 8 lane tiles, and 20 hit point tokens. Several variants have been released, including a \\"Finn vs. Jake\\" box, a \\"BMO vs. Lady Rainicorn\\" release, and a \\"Lumpy Space Princess vs. Princess Bubblegum\\" set. =Comic= A 6-issue comic series by Kaboom! is planned, with full subscriptions being sold in advance. #issue 1 released July 2015 with 3 alternate covers by John Kovalic, for the San Diego Comic Con and 10-year anniversary commemoration #issue 2 having released August 2015 with 1 cover by Jen Wang Explanatory notes References External links  2012 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"Card Wars"},{"id":"42534125","text":"\\"BMO Noire\\" is the seventeenth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. The episode was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on August 6, 2012. The episode guest stars Andy Milonakis as N.E.P.T.R. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, animated to emulate the style of a crime noir film, BMO (voiced by Niki Yang) goes on the hunt for Finn's missing sock. The episode is largely carried by the voice acting of Yang. Because so much of the dialogue was delivered by her, and she had to voice several different characters, Yang noted that she had trouble sleeping the day before she was scheduled to record. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode ranked as the number one telecast of the day among all boy demographics aged 2‚Äì11 and 6‚Äì11. The episode received largely positive critical reviews. Plot While leaving for an excursion, Finn announces to Jake that he cannot find his missing sock, BMO decides to treat the situation like an old-time crime case, donning the persona of a hardboiled detective. BMO first talks to Ronnie, a mouse, and the topic soon turns to Lorraine, a chicken, and an apparent former love interest of BMO's. Following Ronnie's advice, BMO ventures to the pantry, but is almost locked inside. Once BMO escapes, Officer Davis, a cat, threatens to arrest BMO for interfering with police business. BMO, ignoring Officer Davis' threat, heads over to Lorraine's. When BMO suggests that Ronnie took it, she laughs at the idea, saying that if Ronnie were man enough to take a sock she would not be spending her nights with Bebe; eventually, Lorraine confesses that Bebe was the one who stole the sock. Unbeknownst to either, Ronnie was hiding near the rafters and overheard the conversation. BMO heads to Bebe's, a supposed dance club downtown, and interrogates, who Bebe denies knowing anything about the sock. BMO goes to wash soot off of its hands, but when BMO gets back Bebe is dead and the police have arrived. BMO runs from the cops, but trips and falls down the tree fort's ladder, hitting its head. While unconscious, BMO has a strange dream. Eventually, BMO wakes up, and after a brief talk with N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis) realizes that a sock's worth of treasure was missing from that tree fort. At first, BMO thinks that Ronnie took the sock to carry the treasure, killed Bebe so he would not tell anyone, and pinned it on BMO. But he soon begins to suspect it was Lorraine; BMO confronts the chicken, who confesses to framing Ronnie and Bebe. Finn and Jake eventually return, and BMO presents them with the newfound sock. Production The episode also marks the return of Andy Milonakis as N.E.P.T.R. \\"BMO Noire\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The beginning and ending of the episode feature Finn and Jake going on a strange and unexplored adventure (at least within the context of this episode). However, the fifth season episode \\"Princess Potluck\\" explains where Finn and Jake went. When \\"BMO Noire\\" was being storyboarded, Herpich and Page knew that Finn and Jake's adventure would later be explored, but they were assured by Osborne to not worry about it. In an interview with Gumship, Yang revealed that she was under pressure when recording the episode. Due to her relative inexperience as a voice actress, she was so stressed that she did not sleep the night before the lines were recorded. Nate Cash, one of the series' creative directors, later noted that Yang \\"dug deep\\" and succeeded in providing believable voices for many different characters. The episode also marks the return of Andy Milonakis as N.E.P.T.R. When BMO gets knocked out, it has a brief and surreal dream. One image features BMO with a human face. Herpich explained in the DVD commentary for the episode that the entire dream sequence was built off of BMO's desire to be a human‚Äîfirst expressed in the earlier fourth season \\"Five Short Graybles\\". In addition to the usual series background designers (Ghostshrimp, Santino Lascano, and Derek Hunter), Pete Herpich‚ÄîTom Herpich's brother‚Äîdesigned some of the backgrounds in this episode as part of a freelance job. \\"BMO Noire\\" was also his television debut as an artist. Jon Vermilyea also designed several backgrounds for this episode. Reception ‚ÄúBMO Noire‚Äù first aired on Cartoon Network on August 6, 2012. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode ranked as the number on telecast of the day among all boy demographics aged 2‚Äì11 and 6‚Äì11. \\"BMO Noire\\" also ranked first in its timeslot among children groups aged 2‚Äì11 and 6‚Äì11, plus all boy demographics. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 DVD, Jake the Dad, which included 16 episodes from the series' fourth and fifth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"A‚Äì\\", applauding the installment's focus on BMO, a character often featured in only a supporting role. Sava compared the episode to the previous fourth season entry \\"Five Short Graybles\\", noting that both focused on BMO's loneliness and its penchant for inventing or imagining narratives to keep it company. Sava also complimented Yang's voice acting, writing: \\"Niki Yang is a superstar this episode, providing the voices for BMO et al, and the character‚Äôs stilted speech pattern turns stylized dialogue like 'Me and Lorraine are‚Ä¶ dinosaur bones' into a hilarious punchline.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2012 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"BMO Noire"},{"id":"42534126","text":"\\"Burning Low\\" is the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on July 30, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake become convinced that Princess Bubblegum is jealous of Finn's relationship with Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco). In reality, Bubblegum is worried that Flame Princess will be unable to withstand romance without burning a hole in the Earth's crust. The episode, which heavily deals with themes revolving around love and emotion, was originally light on humor, which necessitated series' creative director Adam Muto to insert various jokes and gags. The episode also features the short song \\"Bacon Pancakes\\", which has since become a fan favorite. \\"Burning Low\\" was seen by 3.504 million viewers, making it the highest-rated episode of ‚Äò‚ÄôAdventure Time‚Äô‚Äô that has ever aired. Critically, the episode was met with positive reviews. Plot Although Finn and Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) have been in a relationship for awhile, Finn is unable to do more than hug her. Jake suggests that the next stage in a relationship is kissing. Eventually, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) discovers that Finn and Flame Princess are together, which terribly worries her; Flame Princess's elemental matrix is unstable, and if Finn tries to kiss her, she might react so violently that she would burn a hole through the core of the planet. Bubblegum tries to warn Finn and Jake, but Finn leaves, and Jake mistakes Bubblegum's warnings as signs of jealousy. He eventually tells Finn, who is unsettled. Finn decides that, in order to get a kiss from Flame Princess, he will need to compose a poem; while writing, he is confronted by Bubblegum, who tries to explain the situation. Finn, however, also misinterprets Bubblegum's warning for jealousy, and angrily reproaches the princess for toying with his feelings. Bubblegum arrives upset at Finn and Jake's tree house, and Jake again believes that she is being jealous of Finn's relationship with Flame Princess. When she finally manages to explain to Jake why they can't be together, they barge out of the tree house to stop them. When they arrive, they see Finn reading his poem to Flame Princess, and subsequently kissing, which creates a massive heat explosion, and Flame Princess begins to fall through the hole, burning everything in her path. Finn regains consciousness and ties Jake's arm to himself and descends down the hole. He passes out from the extreme heat. On the surface, Jake covers the hole with his body, to which Bubblegum explains to him he must keep doing it to deprive Flame Princess from oxygen to put her out. She gets sufficiently cold to enable Finn to regain consciousness, and Jake pulls them both out. To prevent further damage, Finn and Flame Princess both kiss a rock to represent them kissing. Production \\"Burning Low\\" was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. When it came time for Sanchez and Sugar to pitch the episode for approval, Adam Muto, one of the series' creative directors, expressed discontent with the fact that the episode contained hardly any jokes. Sugar later noted on the DVD commentary that her heart \\"broke\\" due to the criticism. Ward defended Sanchez and Sugar's treatment of the episode, noting that the story was \\"heavy drama\\". To compensate for such a heavy story, Muto himself added several jokes and gags throughout, such as the reference to President Porpoise. The themes of the episode, dealing with romance and emotion, posed a challenge for the writers. Sanchez, who was responsible for storyboarding out the first half of the episode, attempted to treat the subject delicately and in a way that did not reveal the twist that Bubblegum was not interested in Finn, but rather worried about the ramifications of Flame Princess's emotional instability. Sugar, on the other hand, was excited to storyboard Finn and Bubblegum's confrontation. She later noted that she tried to fill the scene with as much emotion as she could. An extended joke near the beginning of the episode involves Jake explaining the \\"tiers\\" of a relationship to Finn, with Tier 1 being hugging and Tier 15 presumably being sexual intercourse. Sanchez had drafted out ideas for almost every tier, which, according to Sugar, were of \\"varying levels of acceptability for children's television\\". Because so many of the people involved with the series were pitching in jokes for this section, Sanchez later claimed that the tier scene was really an amalgamation of various writers. The episode also features the short song \\"Bacon Pancakes\\", which was written by Sugar in an extremely short period of time. In an interview, she noted that she initially had reservations about the song, because she thought fans would dislike it for its simplistic nature. Reception ‚ÄúBurning Low‚Äù first aired on Cartoon Network on July 30, 2012. It was seen by 3.504 million viewers, and was the thirteenth most-viewed cable show for the week ending August 6. This makes it the highest-rated episode of Adventure Time that has ever aired, in terms of viewers. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 DVD, Jake the Dad, which included 16 episodes from the series' fourth and fifth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", writing that \\"this week‚Äôs story is a great example of how this show takes a common issue and puts a fantastic spin on it.\\" He applauded the episode and the series at large for managing to take a straightforward moral and twisting it into a bizarre and absurd direction.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Steve Wolfhard, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Bert Youn, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on August 13, 2012, and guest stars Erik Estrada as the titular King Worm. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake find themselves trapped in their own subconscious by the King Worm (voiced by Estrada). Eventually, Finn is able to escape the reverie by focusing on his inner-most fears; doing so causes the dream to quickly become a nightmare, wrecking the integrity of the dreamscape and forcing King Worm to flee. The episode, inspired by popular \\"YouTube Poop\\" videos, was an attempt to craft an episode that would feature bizarre and absurd visuals; it also marked the first time that Wolfhard would storyboard for the series. The episode ranked first in its timeslot, but was met with mixed reviews from critics. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club felt that the installment was too absurd, resulting in confusion for the viewer. Nicole Klein of Geekadelphia and Jack O'Keefe of Screenrant, however, both praised the show‚Äôs use of dream imagery and its exploration of Finn's subconscious. Plot Finn wakes up to discover that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife and he is now the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint that reality is not what it seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm. They eventually meet up with the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who is trying to outrun giant monsters made up of morphed- together penguins. Finn and Jake then see their father, Joshua, knitting a scarf. The scarf turns into the King Worm, and the duo give chase. On the top of a mountain, they find the worm frozen, and Finn manages to shatter it, seemingly waking the two from their dream state. However, Finn soon discovers that he is still dreaming and that Jake was not actually with him, but rather another figment of the dream. The King Worm actually presents himself and taunts Finn. Finn, however, unleashes his subconscious fears, and the emotional trauma begins to destroy the dreamscape, weakening King Worm's hold. Eventually, the fears become so powerful that the King Worm is defeated, and Finn wakes up in the real world. He and Jake promptly evict the King Worm from their house. Production alt=A man with black hair, wearing jeans and a denin jacket, is sitting atop a black motorcycle. \\"King Worm\\" was written and storyboarded by Steve Wolfhard, Somvilay Xayaphone, and Bert Youn. Note: Information taken from artist's official Tumblr account. This marked the first time that Wolfhard was credited as a storyboard artist. This is due to the fact that he was largely responsible for storyboarding the episodes third act. At this time in the show's production, Wolfhard was only a storyboard revisionist, and as such, he originally was supposed to have only revised the act. However, he added so much to the section that he was credited as the episode's third storyboard artist. Initially, series creator Pendleton Ward felt that Wolfhard's scenes were not effective; he wanted Finn's nightmares to be composed largely of \\"scary, dream imagery\\". Upon further consideration, however, he changed his mind, applauding how the section focuses on Finn's personal fears. The episode's story itself was developed by Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. It was directed by Larry Leichliter. Ward's goal for the episode was \\"to weird it up\\" and play off bizarre ideas and imagery. Ward latter revealed on his Twitter that many scenes were inspired by popular \\"YouTube Poops\\", which are idiosyncratic and often nonsensical mashups which have been uploaded on the video site YouTube; Ward explained that he enjoyed the concept of Poops and wanted to put them in the episode. Note: Information taken from artist's official Twitter account. While storyboarding the episode, Xayaphone exaggerated the elongation of Finn's ears; this was originally going to be revised, but Ward liked that the effect because it fit in with the concept of an unstable and unreliable dream world. The episode features Erik Estrada, voicing the titular King Worm. He had originally voiced the character in the first season episode \\"Evicted!\\" Tom Kenny did the voice of Lady Rainicorn. The episode was also embedded with references to future episodes. For instance, the large penguin monster, designed by Michael DeForge, later appeared in \\"Reign of Gunters\\". Similarly, \\"The Lich\\", the fourth-season finale, had already been storyboarded by the time \\"King Worm\\" was entering into production. As a result, the crew was able to take the model of the alternate universe Finn‚Äîwho is introduced at the end of \\"The Lich\\"‚Äîand add him as a mirror reflection in \\"King Worm\\". At the end of \\"Evicted!\\", Finn and Jake encounter the King Worm, who puts them in a trance; the ending of \\"King Worm\\", however, seems to imply that Finn and Jake were stuck in a trance between the events of \\"Evicted!\\" and \\"King Worm\\". This could be interpreted as suggesting that the events between the two episodes existed only as part of an elongated dream. Ward, however, stated in the DVD commentary for the episode that such an idea bothered him, because he did not want to destroy the reality of the series. In the end, he noted that he wanted to preserve the status quo by making \\"the real Finn where he is now ... he isn't still dreaming.\\" Adam Muto later noted on his Spring.me account that, were the events between \\"Evicted!\\" and \\"King Worm\\" to have existed only as a part of a dream, then \\"there wouldn't be much point to that.\\" Note: Information taken from artist's official Spring.me account.

The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2014 DVD, The Suitor, which included 16 episodes from the series' first five seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C\\", largely criticizing the installment for its apparent randomness. He argued that \\"being in a dream allows the writers to do whatever they want without any explanation, meaning characters and environments change suddenly and constantly, leaving the viewer as confused as Finn.\\" Sava felt that the only scenes with any pathos were to be found near the end of the episode, but even they were \\"still more focused on bizarre imagery than emotional depth\\", such as the sequence wherein Finn's fears manifest themselves by emerging from his navel. Sava did compliment the episode's designs, however, writing that \\"this episode puts the show‚Äôs off-kilter design sense on full display.\\" Nicole Klein of Geekadelphia, however, applauded the episode's exploration of Finn's psyche, noting that she was pleased with this episode and the fifth season episode \\"The Vault\\" because she \\"love[s] any episode that involves going into Finn‚Äôs crazy subconsciousness\\". Screenrant writer Jack O'Keefe named the episode one of the best television dream sequences, writing: \\"Adventure Time dips into the surreal often and without hesitation, making it nearly impossible to pick a stand-out dream sequence. However, the dream sequence that makes up 'King Worm' is one of Adventure Time‚Äòs highest artistic achievements among many.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2012 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 4) episodes Television episodes about nightmares ","title":"King Worm"},{"id":"42534128","text":"\\"You Made Me\\" is the twentieth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time.

The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) hands over the Pup Gang to Lemongrab after he upsets the Candy Kingdom and demands citizens for his isolated castle. However, Lemongrab is not satisfied with these unruly citizens. Bubblegum eventually makes him a twin to rule with. The episode features the return of Roiland, who had first appeared in the third season episode, \\"Too Young\\". According to Nielsen ratings, the episode ranked as the number one telecast in its time period for all children demographics aged 2‚Äì11, 6‚Äì11, and 9‚Äì14, as well as in all boy demographics. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode, applauding its exploration of Lemongrab. Plot After Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) discovers that the Earl of Lemongrab (voiced by Justin Roiland) is watching her subjects while they sleep, she confronts the Earl, who complains that he has no one to govern. He then has a mental breakdown, accusing Bubblegum of being \\"his glob\\". Bubblegum sends the Pup Gang, a band of delinquent youth, to Lemongrab's castle, but their unruly attitude causes them to be electrocuted and consequently injured by the Earl. Lemongrab subsequently returns to watching the candy citizens as they sleep. The Princess tries to show the Earl how to care for his citizens, but he has another breakdown and leaves. Princess Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake therefore decide journey to Castle Lemongrab to try to help the Earl and save the Pup Gang. Lemongrab soon presents himself, and tries to recondition Finn and Jake. Just when he is about to harm Bubblegum with a soundsword, a clone of Lemongrab, Lemongrab 2, walks into the room. Bubblegum explains that she made him to be the original Lemongrab's companion, so that he would not be so lonely. The two Earls become friends very quickly and send off the Pup Gang, Bubblegum, and Finn and Jake. Production The episode features the return of Lemongrab, voiced by Justin Roiland. \\"You Made Me\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Jesse Moynihan, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. Steve Wolfhard, who would go on to be promoted to series storyboard artist during the show's fifth season, cleaned up most of Herpich's and Moynihan's storyboard drawings. Moynihan himself struggled when making the episode, because he was unsure if audiences would appreciate new dimensions that had been added to the character, or if they only wanted \\"to re-live the moments that made a character popular.\\" The episode features the return of Justin Roiland, who voices the Earl of Lemongrab. \\"You Made Me\\" also featured Lemongrab's catchphrase, \\"Unacceptable!\\" This was added into the episode by Moynihan; Herpich, on the other hand, has refused to place the line in his storyboards again for fear of overusing it. In one scene, Finn opens up several doors in Castle Lemongrab, only to find catcher's mitts. Herpich, who boarded these scenes, refused to explain their meaning, arguing on the DVD commentary for the fourth season that they speak for themselves. Reception \\"You Made Me\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on August 27, 2012. According to Nielsen ratings, the episode ranked as the number one telecast in its time period for all children demographics aged 2‚Äì11, 6‚Äì11, and 9‚Äì14, as well as in all boy demographics. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 3, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake challenge a monster named The Farm to fight, but they end up battling each other. Eventually, they repair their friendship and win the fight. The episode, which guest stars Tom Gammill as The Farm and Matthew Broderick as the Dream Warrior, addresses several different themes, including whether Finn could conceivably hold his own against his more overpower brother, and perhaps more abstractly, whether willpower can overcome physical limitations. The episode was met with mostly positive critical reviews. Plot While exploring a desert wasteland, Finn and Jake encounter a large creature that calls itself The Farm; it is challenging various contenders to best it in combat, but none are able to do so. Both Finn and Jake decide that they want to beat The Farm, so they start training. However, Jake loses interest quickly and reverts to playing Kompy's Kastle, his favorite video game. This angers Finn so much that he breaks the game, which throws Jake into a fit of rage. The two proceed to fight one another in an increasingly violent way, until both are unfit to fight The Farm; despite this, they both challenge the creature anyway, who promptly defeats them and knocks them unconscious. However, while knocked out, both Finn and Jake are visited by a mysterious Dream Warrior (voiced by Matthew Broderick), who gives them the advice that they need‚Äîalbeit in the form riddles‚Äîto defeat The Farm; he tells them to use cheap fighting moves to obscure the creatures vision, pull down his pants, and bite his buttocks. Finn and Jake, working together, use the dream warriors techniques and are victorious. Production Matthew Broderick, who portrays the Dream Warrior, was introduced to the series by his son, James. \\"Who Would Win\\" was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter. A couple of the opening frames were storyboarded by Tom Herpich; both Herpich and Moynihan had been at a comic book convention, and Herpich, who was bored, asked Moynihan if he could start the storyboard for \\"Who Would Win\\" as a way to pass the time. According to Moynihan, the episode revolves around several themes, such as whether Finn could hold his own against the seemingly unstoppable Jake in a fight, and the idea of willpower overcoming physical limitations. The dream sequence featuring the Dream Warrior was based on several spiritual ideas, such as dream journeying, and finding you spirit animal and power totems. Near the beginning of the episode, Finn expresses interest in body modification. Moynihan inserted this reference to maintain continuity with the second season episode \\"Mortal Folly\\", which features a scene with Finn daydreaming that he has a bionic arm. The episode guest stars both Tom Gammill and Matthew Broderick. Gammill plays The Farm, a character that both Ward and Moynihan expressed an interest in bringing back to the show the DVD commentary for the episode. Broderick plays the Dream Warrior; he was introduced to the series by his son James. He later noted in an interview that he liked that Adventure Time \\"doesn't talk down to anybody.\\" Reception \\"Who Would Win\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on September 3, 2012. The episode first saw physical release as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V.

He compared \\"Who Would Win\\" to the previous fourth season episode, \\"Sons of Mars\\", noting that both episode manage to \\"incorporate the show‚Äôs psychedelic imagery and silly toilet humor into stories that build on the relationship between the two bros .\\" In terms of the action sequences in the episode, Sava also argued that the fight was paced similar to the fights between Peter Griffin and The Giant Chicken in the Fox animated sitcom Family Guy.

The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake sneak into the Fire Kingdom on a quest for the Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco). Once there, they discover a plot to assassinate the Flame King, and try to thwart it. The idea for \\"Ignition Point\\" had been developed at a writers meeting, wherein Tom Herpich wanted to focus on political intrigue in the Fire Kingdom. The episode was seen by 2.256 million viewers, and received mostly positive reviews from critics. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club appreciated how the episode ran the gauntlet from toilet humour to Shakespearean references. Plot While spending time with Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), Finn and Jake learn that she misses her scented candles, which she left in the Fire Kingdom. The duo volunteer to retrieve them, but Flame Princess tells them to be careful and watch out for her evil father, Flame King (voiced by Keith David). Once they enter the Flame Kingdom, Finn and Jake manage to acquire the candles, but hear a conspiracy to assassinate the king between two fire beings, one of whom has an untied shoe, and the other has a hissy voice. Finn and Jake traverse the Flame Kingdom palace, trying to identify the culprits. Eventually, Jake gets the idea to dress up as actors and perform a play wherein they pretend to be the conspirators; this will cause the real assassins to act suspicious. Their plan goes awry, and Flame King believes them to be the actual assassins. However, by a lucky turn of events, Finn and Jake are able to unveil the actual culprits, who are the children of Flame King's brother, whom he murdered to acquire the throne. Finn is concerned that, because her father is truly evil, Flame Princess might be evil as well, but Flame King notes that someone with a good spirit could change her. Production \\"Ignition Point\\" was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The origin for the episode was from a writers game. The impetus had been pitched by Herpich, who was interested in \\"political intrigue in the Fire Kingdom\\". Originally, he wanted to base it tonally on Game of Thrones, but the ending episode came out more Shakespearean. Adam Muto revealed via Spring.me that the series' writers and producers watched the 1990 comedy-drama Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead before working on the episode; according to Muto, Osborne is a \\"pretty big fan.\\" Many of the character designs used in this episode had been designed by Andy Ristaino for the third season finale \\"Incendium\\". According to him, \\"the Flame Kingdom was one of the first kingdoms that I really got to go nuts with [and] do my own thing.\\" In this episode, Keith David reprises his role as Flame King.

Finn eventually learns that the Mega Frog is actually a cursed prince, and only a kiss can break the spell. Katz originally was supposed to have appeared in the third season episode \\"The New Frontier\\", but scheduling conflicts resulted in him being unable to voice a character for the show until this episode. \\"The Hard Easy\\", which was advertised as the 100th episode of the series, was viewed by 2.643 million viewers, and received largely positive reviews from television critics. Plot During a rainy day, Finn and Jake are approached by a mudscamp named Woobeewoo (voiced by Kent Osborne), who pleads with the heroes to help save his village. Agreeing to help, Finn and Jake appear before the village elder (voiced by Jonathan Katz) who reveals that their community is under attack by a giant Mega Frog that apparently tries to eat them.

However, behind them, the Mega Frog appears, and he attempts to eat them. Finn and Jake flee into a cave, but the frog gives chase. Then and there, Finn realizes that the frog is not trying to eat them, but rather kiss them; Finn summons up his courage and leaps towards the frog, giving him a kiss that turns the monster into Prince Huge (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray). The prince thanks the two, noting that he had been cursed for some time, even though he had tried to break his own curse. Production \\"The Hard Easy\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne.

Katz was originally supposed to have played the role of Banana Man in the third season episode \\"The New Frontier\\", but he was unavailable at the time of recording; musical comedian \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic subsequently filled the role.

Reception \\"The Hard Easy\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on October 1, 2012. The episode was widely advertised as the 100th episode of the series.

Sava was particularly pleased with the Prince's transformation near the end of the episode, describing it thus: \\"The animation is breathtaking as the frog skin melts away to reveal a human skeleton, which grows nerves and muscles and skin and clothes that form a jolly prince, who has been trying to break his curse for ages.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2012 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 4) episodes ","title":"The Hard Easy (Adventure Time)"},{"id":"42534133","text":"\\"Reign of Gunters\\" is the twenty-fourth episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. The episode was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, and Adam Muto. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on October 8, 2012. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, after stealing a demonic wishing eye, Gunter the penguin creates clones of himself which cause chaos when he tries to take over the Candy Kingdom. Eventually the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) arrives and halts Gunter's reign. The impetus for this episode was a scene that appeared in the second season premiere, \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\" that features Marceline's dad confronting Gunter the penguin. The episode was seen by 1.845 million viewers. The episode, however, received mixed reviews from critics. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club felt that the story did not expand upon Gunter's character; rather he felt that it played out as one long joke. Plot After Gunter (voiced by Tom Kenny) manages to steal the Ice King's (voiced by Kenny) Demonic Wishing Eye, he creates magical clones of himself with which he uses to take over Ooo. Meanwhile, the Ice King journeys to Wizard City to buy a new Demonic Wishing Eye only to be accosted and nearly killed by Laser Wizard, Bufo, and Forest Wizard, who are members of some sort of secret wizard society. Finn and Jake are soon attacked in their treehouse by the magical Gunter clones, which are also able to shape-shift. The duo observe that Gunter and his army have seemingly conquered the entirety of Ooo, save for the Candy Kingdom. The two rush to the aid of Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch), only to see Gunter, assisted by his laser- shooting kitten, conquer the city in one fell swoop. It is revealed that Gunter only wants to conquer the world to satisfy his love of breaking bottles. Finn offers a large number of bottles to Gunter in an attempt to placate him, but Gunter shatters them all immediately and turns his attention to the Candy Kingdom's glass-headed Gumball Guardians. Gunter and his army are nearly about to crack the glass heads of the Gumball Guardians, when the Ice King arrives and notices that Gunter has the Demonic Wishing Eye he has been searching for. He scolds Gunter by spraying him with water, commanding him to return the Eye. Gunter removes the Eye, which causes the Gunter clones to vanish. Production Gunter is voiced by Tom Kenny. \\"Reign of Gunters\\" was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Adam Muto. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter, with Nate Cash serving as creative director, and Nick Jennings serving as art director. The impetus for this episode was a scene that appeared in the second season premiere, \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\" that features Marceline's dad confronting Gunter the penguin and calling him the most \\"the most evil thing [he has] encountered.\\" The opening of the episode, in which Gunter attempts to get the Ice King to brush him, was based on Castuera's cat, Katie, who would often want to be brushed. During the scene in which the Ice King browses the Internet, lead character designer Andy Ristaino added humorous previous search terms, and he designed the web site to look as if it were from the turn of the millennium. The episode introduces Wizard City, a hidden magical settlement which would later be featured in the season 5 episode Wizards Only, Fools. Denizens of Wizard City featured in Reign of Gunters include: Bufo, voiced by Tom Kenny; Forest Wizard, voiced by Ward; and Lazer Wizard, voiced by Tom Kenny. The episode also introduces Huntress Wizard. The original design for the character, crafted by Ako, resembled a female wrestler. Michelle Xin, however, redesigned the character to resemble a plant-based female archer. Moynihan also placed one of his comic character in the background of the city, but changed the design so that Cartoon Network would not own the rights to the character. The scene in which Gunter's kitten begins to float and shoot lasers in order to incapacitate the Candy Kingdom was pitched by Ward and only begrudgingly added into the episode by Moynihan; in the commentary track to the episode, Moynihan admitted that he initially thought the idea was too silly, but eventually came to like it. The scene in which Jake rebuilds a broken bottle was re-storyboarded by Ward after he decided he wanted to make Jake reconstruct it to a beat. Because of the number of poses, the scene ended up taking more time than is usual to draw. Reception \\"Reign of Gunters\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on October 8, 2012. The episode was seen by 1.845 million viewers, and received a 1.3 household rating. This means it was seen by 1.3 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2014 DVD, Princess Day, which included 16 episodes from the series' second through sixth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\". Sava compared the installment to the previous fourth season episode \\"BMO Noire\\", but noted that while the latter \\"builds a story around one of the supporting character that is primarily defined by being cute and lonely\\", \\"Reign of Gunters\\" does not \\"add anything to the character [of Gunter], making it feel like a one-off joke stretched to fill 10 minutes.\\" He also felt that it would have been more enjoyable to watch the action unfold between Ice King and the secret wizard society, because he felt that the action taking place at the Candy Kingdom, while fun, was not very exciting. Despite this, Sava noted that the best part of the episode was when Finn explains to Jake that he is keeping his lady friends in a \\"state of confusion\\" in order to pursue potential romantic relationships with them in the future.

The Chief of the South African Defence Force at the time, General Constand Viljoen, expressed the wish that one of these tanks should be recovered and taken to Pretoria, with the intention to use it as material to strike medals from. His idea was based on the origin of the British Victoria Cross, which was struck from the copper cascabels of a cannon from the Crimean War. The tank is still on display at the Fort Klapperkop Museum in Pretoria, while the resulting medal was the Southern Africa Medal.Geldenhuys, Jannie (1993).

Unlike a copper cannon cascabel, however, the armour steel of a battle tank is too hard to be struck into medals, using hardened steel tooling. The tank itself was therefore not suitable to use to strike medals from. However, since the medal was to be struck in nickel-silver, an alloy of nickel, copper and zinc, several kilograms of copper was recovered from burnt cables in the Xangongo tank, melted, mixed in with molten nickel-silver and then used to manufacture a limited number of the Southern Africa Medal, including the specimen medal depicted. Constand Viljoen Institution The Southern Africa Medal was instituted by the State President in 1987.South African Medal Website - Legal aspects - Fount of Honour (Accessed 1 May 2015) Award criteria The medal was awarded to serving members of all ranks of the South African Defence Force for participation in military operations in Southern Africa, outside the borders of South Africa and South West Africa, between 1 April 1976 and 21 March 1990. Since members who qualified for the medal would also qualify for the award of the Pro Patria Medal, such members were awarded both these campaign medals. Service in Angola during Operation Savannah in 1975 and before 1 April 1976 was excluded, since members who took part in that operation were awarded the Cunene Clasp to the Pro Patria Medal. Order of wear The position of the Southern Africa Medal in the order of precedence was revised three times after 1987, to accommodate the inclusion or institution of new decorations and medals, first upon the integration into the South African National Defence Force in 1994, again in April 1996, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non- statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and finally upon the institution of a new set of honours on 27 April 2003, but it remained unchanged on the latter two occasions. ;South African Defence Force until 26 April 1994: Pro Patria Medal Southern Africa Medal General Service Medal (South Africa) *Official SADF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Pro Patria Medal. ** Succeeded by the General Service Medal. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Railways Police Medal for Combating Terrorism. ** Succeeded by the General Service Medal.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette no. 15093, Pretoria, 3 September 1993 ;South African National Defence Force from 27 April 1994: General Service Medal (Venda) Southern Africa Medal General Service Medal (South Africa) *Official SANDF order of precedence: ** Preceded by the General Service Medal of the Republic of Venda. ** Succeeded by the General Service Medal of the Republic of South Africa. *Official national order of precedence: ** Preceded by the Police Medal for Combating Terrorism of the Republic of Transkei. ** Succeeded by the General Service Medal of the Republic of South Africa.Republic of South Africa Government Gazette Vol. 477, no. 27376, Pretoria, 11 March 2005, Description ;Obverse The Southern Africa Medal is an octagonal medallion struck in nickel silver, 3 millimetres thick, to fit in a circle 38 millimetres in diameter.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Sugar, Patrick McHale, Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The show follows the adventures of Finn (Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Marceline (Olivia Olson) tells the Ice King (Tom Kenny) a fan fiction involving her genderswapped form Marshall Lee (Donald Glover). \\"Bad Little Boy\\" originally aired on Cartoon Network on February 18, 2013. It serves as a sequel to the third season episode \\"Fionna and Cake\\", and sees the return of characters Fionna (Madeleine Martin) and Cake (Roz Ryan), genderswapped forms of Finn and Jake. Glover and Neil Patrick Harris guest star as other genderswapped characters. The episode was a ratings success, being viewed by 3.1 million viewers. In addition, it garnered mostly positive critical reviews. Plot Fionna and Cake go after Doctor Prince for stealing the Enchiridion when he is caught by the Ice King (Tom Kenny) and forced to return it and leave. When the Ice King introduces himself to Fionna and Cake, Slime Princess interrupts the scene, revealing it as part of a story told by the Ice King, and that she and several others are being forced to listen to it. As the Ice King deflects their criticisms, Marceline the Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson) comes out of invisibility and shows herself to the Ice King while unlocking the princesses from captivity. She tells him that she had been listening to his story for a couple of hours and claims that she could tell a better story involving the characters of Fionna and Cake. She begins her tale with Fionna and Cake at their Tree Fort, playing a game that involves hurling an axe at an apple resting on the head of BMO (Niki Yang). Prince Gumball interrupts their game and invites Fionna on another \\"mission\\". Suddenly, a blurry figure rushes past them, and they hear knocking on the roof of the Dome. When Fionna, Cake, and Gumball approach the roof, they find Marshall Lee the Vampire King, who invites Fionna and Cake to a party held by Lumpy Space Prince. At the party, Marshall Lee sings a song to Fionna, to which Fionna sings along. When Fionna is pulled away to talk to Marshall Lee, Cake takes over the song. In their discussion, Marshall Lee asks Fionna why she wants to spend so much time with him. This leads to playful fighting between them, followed by actual pushing and shoving, until Cake breaks up the two. After Marshall Lee verbalizes his inherently evil nature, he grabs hold of Cake and takes her to the nearby graveyard guarded by an army of beatboxing skeletons. After Fionna defeats the skeletons, she approaches Marshall Lee, who turns into a batlike monster. When he impales himself on a spear sticking out of the top of the tomb he is standing on, he returns to his vampire form wounded. As she mourns over him, he asks Fionna to admit that she is in love with him. Angered, she demands that he stop playing with her emotions and be honest for how long he has to live. Jolted, Marshall Lee reveals that the wound is fake and tells her that she is the \\"realest person\\" he has ever met. Fionna, ecstatic, punches him in the face playfully before going in to attack him more. Marceline ends her story. While the princesses are satisfied, the Ice King voices that he prefers his version instead. When the rest disagree, he throws them out. Later, he goes to his basement containing gigantic ice sculptures of Fionna and Cake, telling that, one day, he will reach them. Cast The episode guest starred Donald Glover as Marshall Lee the Vampire King Taking place in a fan- fictional, genderswapped universe, \\"Bad Little Boy\\" likewise features genderswapped versions of the inhabitants of Ooo. A list of the major characters featured in the episode follows: ; Fionna : Fionna (Madeleine Martin), a genderswapped Finn, is a brave and adventurous girl, who throughout the episode runs into conflict with Marshall Lee. ; Cake : Cake (Roz Ryan), a genderswapped Jake, is sarcastic and boisterous but also Fionna's loyal friend. Much like Jake, she possesses the power to stretch her body into a myriad of convoluted shapes. ; Marshall Lee the Vampire King : Marshall Lee (Donald \\"Childish Gambino\\" Glover), a genderswapped Marceline, is a half-demon vampire king, who, through the episode, teases Fionna by trying to convince her that she has a crush on him. ; Lumpy Space Prince : Lumpy Space Prince (Pendleton Ward), a genderswapped Lumpy Space Princess, who has the personality exact same as his Ooo counterpart. ; Prince Gumball : Gumball (Neil Patrick Harris), a genderswapped Princess Bubblegum, who appears to harbor some sort of grudge against Marshall. His appearance in the episode is limited. Production \\"Bad Little Boy\\" was written and storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Sugar, Patrick McHale, Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. Martin and Ryan respectively return as Fionna and Cake‚Äîgenderswapped forms of Finn and Jake introduced in the eponymous ninth episode of the third season. The characters were at first designed by Natasha Allegri out of fun, but Ward suggested they have their own episode. It was a success, but during the nine-month production schedule he only considered it an experiment. After the success, the writers had to pause and reflect whether a sequel should come from \\"a personal fire, something to give it real worth\\", or from audience demand; Ward considered the former reason mostly followed. He praised Sanchez and Sugar for their work as \\"turbo- talented writers and drawers\\". The episode introduces Marshall Lee, voiced by Donald Glover (of Community fame). His character delivers a performance in both melody and spoken word. Regarding his role, Ward said, \\"Donald is the bomb. He's got awesome funny chops and singing chops and we spotlight all his chops in the episode. I was super stoked when he came in, and he's told me he's super stoked to have worked on it, which makes me extra stoked\\". Harris (of How I Met Your Mother fame), guest stars as Prince Gumball, also introduced in \\"Fionna and Cake\\". Broadcast and reception \\"Bad Little Boy\\" first aired on February 18, 2013, on Cartoon Network. The episode was watched by 3.1 million viewers, receiving a Nielsen rating of 0.7 for adults in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. According to TV by the Numbers, it was the 26th most-watched cable television episode of its air date. The broadcast followed the release of an iOS game titled Fionna Fights featuring Fionna and Cake, as well as a Fionna and Cake DVD including 16 episodes from various seasons. Critical reception was generally positive. In Entertainment Weekly, Darren Franich graded it an A‚àí, designating it as a \\"brilliant sci-fi\\", \\"fantasy\\", and \\"musical mash-up\\". He highlighted the \\"passion, betrayal, a spoken-word interlude, and a beatboxing skeleton\\" as contrasting the 11-minute running time. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave it the same grade, writing that because of the short running time, \\"Fionna and Cake's episodes are filled with what makes this show great\\". He said that it reflects a shift from \\"the sunny whimsy\\" of the early seasons to \\"the darker, melancholic elements\\" as it \\"further explores the history of Ooo\\". Geekadelphia writer Dan Tabor gave a more mixed review, calling the exchange between the world of Fionna and Ooo \\"a bit too much\\" and made it \\"seem a bit unfocused\\". He lauded the songs, which he felt were similar to the original Fionna and Cake episode, and ultimately opined that it was \\"still enjoyable\\". AXS contributor Justin Cecil listed Glover's song in the episode as his tenth best work. Krutika Mallikarjuna picked out twelve of the most \\"what the fuck\\" moments of the episode for a list article in BuzzFeed.

The episode was written and storyboarded by series creator Pendleton Ward and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story by Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on May 6, 2013. The episode guest stars animator James Baxter as the titular horse. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake stumble across a horse named James Baxter (voiced by Baxter the animator) who has the ability to make sad people feel better. While seeking to emulate James Baxter's style, Finn and Jake accidentally anger the spirit of a deceased being at a funeral and are nearly killed by it; however, James Baxter arrives at the last moment and cheers the spirit up. The impetus for the episode stemmed from a guest lecture Baxter gave at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) when Ward was a student; during the discussion, someone requested that he animate a horse on a beach ball, a concept which fixed itself into Ward's mind. The episode was viewed by 2.21 million viewers and received a 1.4 household rating. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club wrote positively of the episode, arguing that it was a metacommentary on the nature of Adventure Time itself. Likewise, Ryan Thomason of WatchPlayRead enjoyed the episode, both for its full embracing of silliness, and also for its darker ending. Plot The destruction of an egg causes BMO (voiced by Niki Yang) to start crying. Finn and Jake try to cheer it up, but only make matters worse. Only when James Baxter (voiced by James Baxter), a horse who neighs his name frequently while balancing on a beach ball, arrives on the scene does BMO feel any better. Inspired by the actions of James Baxter, Finn and Jake decide that they want to try to make people feel better. As such, they journey across the magical land of Ooo (wherein Finn and Jake live) and emulate Baxter's brand of humor by saying their names humorously just like James Baxter. However, after interrupting a funeral and accidentally frightening a young Candy Kingdom citizen, they realize that they are merely making people feel worse. Finn, Jake, and BMO travel to the So-Und Institute of Sound (a research facility that studies the nature of sound), where they attempt to discover the ultimate \\"feel-good\\" sound. After much experimentation, Jake eventually decides to morph into and emulate the sound of a trumpet, while Finn feigns playing him. Their plan is a success, and they cheer up a multitude of people across Ooo. However, when they return to the aforementioned funeral, they accidentally anger the ghost of the deceased individual. This spirit overpowers Finn and Jake and attempts to kill them, but before the two meet their demise, James Baxter arrives and calms the ghost by making it laugh. With his job completed, Baxter gallops off into the sunset. Production \\"James Baxter the Horse\\" was written and storyboarded by series creator Pendleton Ward and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story developed by Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. When scripting an episode outline that he knows will be storyboarded by Xayaphone, Ward often inserts story notes urging Xayaphone to explore his interest in noise music. In the commentary for the fourth season episode \\"Dream of Love\\", Ward noted that the story outline for \\"James Baxter the Horse\\" had caused Xayaphone much excitement, because he finally had free rein \\"to explore noise-making\\".Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014. \\"Dream of Love\\" [Commentary track], Adventure Time Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Cartoon Network.

In the lecture, Baxter was showing students how to animate certain situations, and someone suggested that Baxter try animating a horse balancing on a beach ball. Baxter declined the suggestion, instead opting to animate something \\"simpler\\".McDonnell (2014), p. 299. However, according to Adam Muto, the image of a horse and a beach ball fixed itself in Ward's mind. Later, when Adventure Time was in production, Baxter called Ward to let him know that if the series needed any special animation work done, he would enjoy working on the show. Ward then met with Baxter and pitched him the initial idea behind \\"James Baxter the Horse\\"; Baxter himself thought the idea was \\"great\\", and was flattered that Ward wanted to name the eponymous character after him.McDonnell (2014), p. 298. Baxter himself animated all instances of the horse and beach ball. While the show's animation is usually handled overseas in South Korea by either Rough Draft Korea or by Saerom Animation,McDonnell (2014), pp. 348‚Äì349. Baxter animated his scenes from his home studio. Because of this hurdle, Baxter was forced to animate in the center of the paper so that during the compositing phase, his animation could be moved around if necessary. Baxter's wife, Kendra, did all the clean-up work for his animation, and inking & painting of the animation was done in South Korea. Reception \\"James Baxter the Horse\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on May 6, 2013. The episode was viewed by 2.21 million viewers, making it the top-rated Cartoon Network series during the week of May 6‚Äì12. The episode scored a 1.4 Nielsen household rating. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 1.4 percent of all households watching television at the time of the airing. The episode first saw commercial release as part of the 2014 The Suitor DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series. It was later re-released as part of the complete fifth season DVD in July 2015. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\" and succinctly described it as \\"an episode all about finding the right combinations of sounds and actions to make a person happy, and it‚Äôs hard not to see it as a metacommentary on the creation of Adventure Time.\\" Sava praised the \\"audio/visual combo\\" that represented James Baxter and felt that he was consistently funny throughout the episode. Later, in a review of the season five episode \\"Shh!\\", Sava wrote that \\"James Baxter the Horse\\" was an episode that \\"looked at this show‚Äôs musical philosophy\\". Ryan Thomason of WatchPlayRead wrote that \\"a horse on a beach ball neighing it‚Äôs [sic] name to the delight of everyone that is sad ever is a pretty high concept [for] silliness\\", but that the episode took a dark turn with the introduction of \\"the creepy skittering skeleton [of the deceased individual] that pops out of the casket [and its] sad evil giant ghost [...] that nearly kills Finn and Jake.\\" Explanatory notes References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= * External links  2013 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 5) episodes ","title":"James Baxter the Horse"},{"id":"42534219","text":"\\"Wizards Only, Fools\\" is the twenty-sixth episode of the fifth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. The episode was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Thomas Wellmann, from a story by Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, and Moynihan. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on July 1, 2013. The episode guest stars Duncan Trussell as Ron James and Maurice LaMarche as Grand Master Wizard. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) disguise themselves as wizards and sneak into Wizard City after Starchy (voiced by Tom Kenny) comes down with a cold and needs a magical cure. However, Bubblegum keeps insisting to everyone that magic is just a mystical way of explaining the world, and that scientism is the superior epistemological view. The three, along with Abracadaniel (voiced by Steve Little) are eventually arrested for impersonating wizards, but manage to break out of prison with the help of a \\"cold\\" spell that literally produces cold weather. \\"Wizards Only, Fools\\" was the second and final episode of the series to have been storyboarded by Wellmann, a cartoonist from Germany. He and Moynihan worked on the episode via e-mail and Skype. Thematically, the episode explores the conflict between religion and science, with the former symbolically represented in the episode as magic. On the day of its airing, it was seen by 2.5 million viewers and ranked as the second-highest rated Cartoon Network series. The episode received largely positive reception from critics, and series' art director Nick Jennings later won an Emmy Award for his work on the episode. Plot Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum disguise themselves as wizards and sneak into Wizard City in order to secure a spell to cure a cold that is plaguing Starchy (a sentient malt ball, voiced by Tom Kenny). They approach potion-seller Ron James (voiced by Duncan Trussell), but he sees through their charade and calls the wizard police on the trio. Finn, Jake, and Bubblegum steal a cold spell and then run from the scene of the crime. After a long chase, the three run into Abracadaniel (a meek and somewhat feeble-powered wizard with whom the three are familiar, voiced by Steve Little), who is accidentally roped into their conspiracy. The four are soon arrested and stand trial before the Grand Master Wizard (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), who offers to let all of them go free if Princess Bubblegum will concede that \\"wizards rule\\". However, Bubblegum stubbornly refuses; she finds that the wizards' insistence on defining the unknown and fantastic as \\"magic\\" flies in the face of the scientific method. The Grand Master Wizard, angered, sentences all four to Wizard Prison. Once at the prison, Abracadaniel challenges Bubblegum to a knife fight. Bubblegum bests him, but refuses to kill him, which causes a riot. In midst of the fray, Finn and Jake learn that the cold spell, instead of curing a cold, actually produces ice; they creatively use it freeze the entire complex. Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake escape and return to the Candy Kingdom, where Bubblegum (with the help of Abracadaniel) distracts Starchy with magic while she administers a vaccine. Production The episode guest stars Maurice LaMarche as the Grand Master Wizard. \\"Wizards Only, Fools\\", which originally went under the production title of \\"Only Wizards Allowed\\", Note: Information taken from the official Frederator-affiliated Tumblr account. was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and German cartoonist Thomas Wellmann, from a story by series creator Pendleton Ward, Adam Muto, Kent Osborne, and Moynihan. This episode was the second and final installment of the series that Wellmann worked on, following the earlier season five episode \\"The Suitor\\". Wellmann had been asked to storyboard for the series following a chance meeting with members of the Adventure Time crew at the 2012 Toronto Comics Arts Festival. Whereas Wellmann felt \\"anxious and overwhelmed\\" while working on \\"The Suitor\\", he felt that he was \\"more releaxed\\" storyboarding \\"Wizards Only, Fools\\". Because Wellmann lives in Germany, he and Moynihan collaborated on the episode via e-mail and Skype.Thomas (2020), p. 295, note 5. The episode guest stars comedians Duncan Trussell and Maurice LaMarche as Ron James and the Grand Master Wizard, respectively. Moynihan later noted on his personal website that he created the character of Ron James with Trussell specifically in mind. Themes The episode explores the differences in scientific and religious perspectives by presenting the two sides as competing modes of discourse; Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club argues that magic users, such as Jake, stand \\"for magic and the wonderful unknown\\", whereas Bubblegum stands for \\"cold, hard facts\\". While Bubblegum is resistant to embrace magical ways of thinking, by the episode's end, she realizes that \\"magic has its uses\\". Moynihan later noted on his personal website that, \\"in helping to write the episode, it wasn‚Äôt important (for me) to impart an idea of who is right or wrong about magic and science in the land of Ooo. It was important to impart the idea of a complex and contradictory fantasy.\\" He later argued that using the \\"science v. religion\\" debate to backdrop an episode was enjoyable because it allowed him to have \\"fun with both sides of the perspective spectrum.\\" Likewise, Wellmann thought the show's willingness to explore weighty subjects is one of the ways the show has been so successful. He wrote, \\"one of the biggest strengths of Adventure Time [is] that it‚Äôs bold to explore topics like [...] science v. religion in a non-judging, open-minded way.\\"Thomas (2020), p. 295, note 6. John V. Karavitis, in the chapter \\"The Finn-losophy of Adventure Time\\" from the book Adventure Time and Philosophy, sees the situation at hand in a different light. According to him, magic and science clearly exist within the confines of Ooo, but more importantly, they also represent two completely different ways of viewing the world.Karavitis (2015), p. 5. Science is a way of \\"observ[ing] the world, mak[ing] educated guesses about how it works and conduct[ing] expierments [...] in order to confirm or disprove our ideas about the world. [...] Science requires that we be rational, that we try to actively understand the world, and to take steps to verify our understanding.\\"Karavitis (2015), pp. 8, 11. In this sense, it is ultimately the responsible perspective. Magic, on the other hand, is \\"the metaphysics of immaturity\\" because it does not require understanding the reality of the actual world.Karavitis (2015), pp. 9, 11. Magic, according to Karavitis, is therefore an irresponsible perspective to take.Karavitis (2015), p. 9. Reception \\"Wizards Only, Fools\\" first aired on June 30, 2013 on Cartoon Network. The episode was watched by 2.5 million viewers, and received a 1.5 Nielsen household rating. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 1.5 percent of all households in the country at the time of the broadcast. The episode was the 2nd most-watched Cartoon Network program on the night it aired. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2014 The Suitor DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first through fifth seasons. It was later re- released as part of the complete fifth season DVD in July 2015. Sava awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\", writing that \\"Wizards Only, Fools\\" is \\"one of those glorious episodes where the writers have a wealth of ideas that they are able to turn into one cohesive yet frantically madcap narrative, delivering an episode that provides mental stimulation for adults while satisfying all the sensory needs of children.\\" He applauded the episode's humor, willingness to explore controversial ideas, and its set pieces. Specific praise went towards the episode's final act, which takes place in Wizard Prison, with Sava likening the act to the late-90s television series Oz. For his work on the episode, former series' art director Nick Jennings won an Emmy for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement In Animation\\", making it the series' second Emmy win.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, Adam Muto, and Moynihan. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on July 29, 2013. The episode guest stars Jill Talley as the eponymous Sky Witch. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Marceline enlists Princess Bubblegum's help in order to track Maja the Sky Witch (voiced by Talley); it is revealed that Marceline's ex-boyfriend Ash sold Marceline's beloved stuffed animal Hambo to Maja. Only when Bubblegum trades her prized rock shirt‚Äîwhich was given to her by Marceline‚Äîis Hambo able to be reunited with Marceline. The 1973 film Don't Look Now as well as the American clothing chain American Apparel inspired parts of the episode. Chris Houghton, a cartoonist for the official Adventure Time comic book, was hired to do freelance work for the episode. \\"Sky Witch\\" was met with critical acclaim, with reviewers commenting on the series' approach and presentation of Marceline and Bubblegum's relationship. In addition, the episode was watched by 2.075 million viewers. The events in this episode were continued in the sixth season episode \\"Something Big\\". Plot Marceline arrives at the Candy Kingdom and beseeches Bubblegum to help her track down Maja, the Sky Witch (voiced by Jill Talley), arguing that it will allow the two to spend \\"quality time\\" with one another. Bubblegum eventually agrees, and the two journey to Maja's trap-infested lair. Bubblegum soon learns that Marceline is hoping to retrieve her beloved teddy bear, Hambo, that her ex-boyfriend Ash had previously traded for a magic wand. Bubblegum is annoyed that Marceline is worrying about a mere teddy bear, but Marceline, thinking that she sees Hambo, takes off, deeper into the lair. Bubblegum gives chase, eventually discovering the inner sanctum of Maja's lair, where she confronts Maja herself. With Marceline disposed, fighting Maja's crow-rabbit familiar, Bubblegum realizes that since Maja purchased Hambo legally however dubious the transaction was, she has to respect the sale. She therefore trades Maja her beloved rock shirt for Hambo. Maja is later seen ominously musing that, because the shirt has more \\"psychic resonance\\", she will be able to use it for \\"something big\\". Production Jill Talley voices Maja. \\"Sky Witch\\" was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuere and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, Moynihan, and Adam Muto. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Nate Cash. On the behest of Pendarvis, Moynihan and Castuera inserted a reference to the 1973 film Don't Look Now, although Pendarivs later noted that because the two storyboard artists \\"worked a magical transformation\\", it was \\"not really an allusion anymore\\". The design for Marceline's outfit was based on an American Apparel model that Moynihan and Castuer had both seen. In turn, they decided to \\"make fun of\\" it and exaggerate it for use in the show. Actress Jill Talley voiced Maja; she is also the wife of fellow series voice actor Tom Kenny. Chris Houghton, a cartoonist noted for drawing the covers for the first twelve issues of the official Adventure Time comic book, was hired to do freelance work for the episode. He was largely tasked with drawing finalized versions of Maja‚Äîheavily based upon Moynihan and Castuera's designs‚Äîas well as certain key frames for the episode. Santino Lascano, one of the background artists for the show, later wrote online that it was \\"fun\\" to design for this episode because it enabled him to draw new locations that the show had yet to explore. He noted that Maja's totems featured in the episode were designed to resembled the real-life sculptures made by Castuera. Reception \\"Sky Witch\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on July 29, 2013. The episode was viewed by 2.075 million viewers and scored a 1.3 Nielsen rating. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 1.3 percent of all households that were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. Furthermore, the episode was the most-watched episode of television for Cartoon Network during the week of July 29 to August 4. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" and called it \\"awesome in every way\\" due to it showcasing Marceline and Princess Bubblegum's developing friendship. Saraiya applauded the fact that the show pushed two characters who are \\"both terrible at demonstrating their own vulnerability\\" together, allowing both of the character's faults to play off of one another. Some critics argued that the episode seemed to officially recognize a relationship between Marceline and Bubblegum, unofficially referred to as \\"Bubbline\\", a portmanteau of \\"Bubblegum\\" and \\"Marceline\\". Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com wrote that the episode \\"appears to shift Bubbeline from subtext to canon\\". Ali Osworth of Autostraddle argued that the episode was evidence that the show was moving towards officially recognizing, or \\"canonizing\\", the relationship. On his website, Moynihan, however, argued that the meaning of the episode is up in the air and is contingent on how the audience interprets it. He noted: \\"I think it‚Äôs important for me express that I rarely believe a writer has more authority over the meaning of their writing than the audience. When you submit a narrative to the public [the] writer no longer has the last word and sometimes their word is worse anyway.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2013 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 5) episodes American LGBT- related television episodes LGBT-related animation Lesbian- related television shows ","title":"Sky Witch"},{"id":"42534222","text":"\\"Frost & Fire\\" is the thirtieth episode of the fifth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time.

He then decides to stage a fight between the two in real life to see if he can finish the dream. However, during the fight, Flame Princess destroys the Ice Kingdom and discovers that Finn set up the fight. Feeling betrayed, she breaks up with him. \\"Frost & Fire\\" was the last episode of the fifth season to have been storyboarded by Pearson, although he later returned to revise the storyboards for \\"Earth & Water\\". \\"Frost & Fire\\" was seen by 3.009 million people, making it one of only four season five episodes to be watched by over 3 million viewers. The episode received largely positive critical reception, with Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club applauding its subtle exploration of puberty and sexuality. Plot After Finn watched his girlfriend, Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco) and Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny) fight, he has a strange dream that gives him a sense of pleasure; however, he is not able to finish it before he wakes up. Upon awakening, he realizes that the Cosmic Owl (voiced by M. Emmet Walsh) was in the vision, which Jake interprets to mean that the reverie was prophetic. Jake urges Finn to somehow finish the dream. Finn, therefore, gets Flame Princess and Ice King to fight once more, but this time Ice King nearly defeats Flame Princess. That night, Finn has a similar dream, only this time, he imagines Ice King blasting him with ice. The following day, Finn‚Äîin an attempt to once again finish his pleasurable dream‚Äîdelivers forged notes to both Flame Princess and Ice King; these notes incite the two to fight once again, only this time, Flame Princess grows immense with rages and begins melting the Ice Kingdom. Finn, realizing that he caused this situation, saves the Ice King and confronts Flame Princess, telling her the truth. Hurt and saddened, she breaks up with Finn and leaves the Ice Kingdom in ruins. Production \\"Frost & Fire\\" was written and storyboarded by Luke Pearson and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story by Kent Osborne, series creator Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and showrunner Adam Muto. This episode was the last fifth-season episode to feature Pearson as a freelance storyboard artist, although he would return to revise storyboards in \\"Earth & Water\\", and storyboard both \\"Football\\" and \\"May I Come In?\\" during the show's seventh season. The episode also marked the first episode that Pendarvis contributed to; Pendarvis joined the writing team in October 2012, after Osborne, a friend of his, asked him to freelance write for the series for two weeks. Eventually, Pendarvis and the writing staff got along so well that he was invited to permanently join the team. During one part in the storyboard, Finn watches as Flame Princess and Ice King fight. Pendarvis, when compiling the outline for the episode, described the sequence as: \\"[Finn] bites his knuckle like Vera Miles watching the boys fight over her in The Searchers\\". This visual reference eventually made its way into the final episode. Santino Lascano, one of the series' background artists and a veteran from the show' first season, noted on his Tumblr that the episode had \\"a relatively light workload\\" because it stuck largely to \\"familiar\\" locations, such as the Tree Fort and the Ice Kingdom. With that being said, Lascano noted that it was \\"fun to 'destroy' places [that he] was involved in creating way back in Season 1\\", a reference to him having helped Dan \\"Ghostshrimp\\" James develop the initial look for the series. Reception \\"Frost & Fire\\" aired on Cartoon Network on August 5, 2013. The episode was seen by 3.009 million viewers and scored a 0.7 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.7 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. This made it the highest-rated episode of the series since the airing of \\"Bad Little Boy\\" in February of the same year. \\"Frost & Fire\\" was also one of only four episodes that aired during the show's fifth season‚Äîalong with \\"Finn the Human\\", \\"Jake the Dog\\", and \\"Bad Little Boy\\"‚Äîto be watched by over 3 million viewers.

Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\", calling it one of his \\"favorite kind of Adventure Time episode\\" because it is \\"a metaphor that speaks to the difficulty of growing up while embracing the unbridled fun of being a kid.\\" Sava complimented the fact that the series was willing to deal with subjects such as puberty and sexuality in dreams. He was also complimentary towards the climactic battle between Flame Princess and Ice King, describing it as a \\"Kaiju Flame Princess vs. Kaiju Ice King battle\\".

Its original air date on Cartoon Network was September 9, 2013. The episode was written by Kent Osborne and Cole Sanchez and directed by Elizabeth Ito, from a story by Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. Tom Kenny lent the voice of Magic Man, the episode's antagonist. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline the Vampire Queen struggle to retrieve Jake's sandwich that Magic Man steals. Magic Man tells a riddle that would allow them to retrieve it but summons a bubble that decelerates himself in time. Inspiration for the story was found in a popular video of Paula Deen preparing a sandwich in slow motion. Approximately two million viewers saw it on the original air date. Reviews were positive of its visuals and comic aspects, especially following a succession of episodes that were perceived as more serious. Plot Jake prepares a sandwich that he has been anxious to make all day. As soon as he completes it, with Finn and their robot BMO (Niki Yang) present in the room, Magic Man (Kenny) appears and steals the sandwich. Magic Man offers the sandwich back to him if he is able to solve a riddle. Jake insults his riddle, prompting Magic Man to fall from their house. Magic Man summons a bubble that decelerates time, allowing him to slow his descent. Finn and Jake partially enter the bubble, where five hours elapse in real time. BMO claims to compute the solution for Finn and Jake, but BMO has the two build a ramp so that the robot looks cool skateboarding in the bubble. Finn calls Bubblegum for help as Jake tries to make a new sandwich. Bubblegum explains to Finn that the bubble uses molasses at room temperature to decelerate its contents, and that a \\"molasses warmer\\" would reverse the effect. The warmer detonates in the bubble, but it explodes at the same slow rate. With no more ideas, Bubblegum calls Marceline for help. Marceline assures Jake, unable to make an equivalent sandwich, that she will help retrieve his sandwich, but she too becomes stuck in the bubble. Jake enters the bubble out of desperation, pouting, and is able to move at a normal pace. The rest figure this to be part of Magic Man's riddle, but Finn has to remind Jake to continue being sad as he runs. Jake thinks of Mr. Cupcake (Dee Bradley Baker) gaining the affections of Lady Rainicorn (Yang), Jake's lover, following his death, making Jake angry. Finn tells him to think of sad thoughts instead; Jake imagines Mr. Cupcake mourning Jake's death and the two reconciling, making Jake cry and allowing him to reach Magic Man in time. Marcy kicks him in the groin and BMO rolls over him. Jake wins back the sandwich, and the bubble bursts. The episode ends with Jake lying on the ground crying happily. He finally takes a bite of his sandwich, while blubbering \\"So so good...\\" Production \\"Time Sandwich\\" was written by Kent Osborne and Cole Sanchez. As part of a team responsible for sequencing scenes, Osborne and Sanchez adapted the episode from a story previously devised by series creator Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, Adam Muto, and Osborne. The episode was directed by Elizabeth Ito, her seventh credit for the season. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings. According to Osborne, the story for \\"Time Sandwich\\" was inspired by a widely circulated video of celebrity chef Paula Deen preparing a sandwich. The video, which has been slowed down, grew popular for enhancing the tension and absurdity of her preoccupation with making the sandwich. Osborne argued that the episode has \\"a crazy story featuring almost all of the regular characters, but the goal is super simple\\". Sanchez expressed enjoyment at having written the episode, calling it \\"crazy fun to work on.\\" He specifically praised Osborne's work, arguing that his scenes were consistently hilarious. The central plot to \\"Time Sandwich\\" revolves around the antics of Magic Man. The character was introduced in the first-season episode \\"Freak City\\" is his first, and reappeared in the fourth-season episode \\"Sons of Mars\\" and the earlier fifth- season episode \\"All the Little People\\". Magic Man is voiced by Tom Kenny, who also voices the Ice King on the series. Broadcast and reception \\"Time Sandwich\\" originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 9, 2013. This airing earned a Nielsen rating of 1.3, in that 1.3 percent of families with a television set watched the episode on that date. The rating represents approximately two million viewers, the network's third most-viewed airing for the second week in September. \\"Time Sandwich\\" earned positive reviews. Oliver Sava, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B+ grade, remarking that the deceleration of time juxtaposed with the fast pace inherent to the episode. He called the episode funny and described that as a pleasant shift from the preceding episodes, which dealt with poignant themes and characters. Sava praised the illustrations in the episode, especially that of the time bubble. Eric Kohn wrote that the episode was \\"beguiling\\" and \\"cockamamie\\" for IndieWire Daily. Nicolas Michaud, writing in his book Adventure Time and Philosophy, called the episode metaphysical in its contrasting of science and magic. He regarded Bubblegum's role in the episode as corroborating her as the \\"staunchest proponent and defender\\" of the scientific method. TV.com's staff found the comical aspects excellent, as were the visuals. In particular, the staff called BMO riding the skateboard in front of Marceline the best image the show had accomplished. John Moe and Open Mike Eagle, in Conversation Parade: An Adventure Time Podcast, observed that fans held the episode as the best introduction to Adventure Time.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Graham Falk, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on December 2, 2013. Pendarvis voices the title character, and guest star Anne Heche voices the character's wife, Cherry Cream Soda. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Root Beer Guy (voiced by Jack Pendarvis) witnesses Finn and Jake abduct Princess Bubblegum, but no one believes him. He eventually decides to take matters into his own hands. In the end, it is revealed that Bubblegum set up the entire situation to test her police force: the banana guards. Because he solved the case, Root Beer Guy is promoted to head of the banana guards. \\"Root Beer Guy\\" was the second episode of the season to have been storyboarded by Falk, who was a guest artist on the show. Originally, the writers considered asking author Stephen King to voice the eponymous character, although he was never actually approached. The episode was viewed by 1.842 million viewers, and Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised the episode for its introduction of new characters with depth, and for its parodying of detective fiction. Plot Root Beer Guy (voiced by Jack Pendarvis) is a candy citizen with a dead-end job; as a method of escapism, he often tries his hand at writing a crime and detective novel. One night, while working at his typewriter, he oversees Finn and Jake kidnapping Princess Bubblegum. He tells his wife, Cherry Cream Soda (voiced by Anne Heche), who brushes Root Beer Guy's story off as a dream. Root Beer Guy decides to take matters into his own hands, and he begins investigating. After being told forcefully by Finn and Jake to drop the case, Root Beer Guy soon discovers that they recently purchased suspicious materials and are headed out to Lake Butterscotch, possibly to dispose of a body. Root Beer Guy follows them, only to witness them throwing what appears to be Princess Bubblegum into the lake. In a desperate attempt to alert the authorities, he calls the banana guards and tells them that he himself kidnapped the princess. They arrive to arrest him, but soon Bubblegum emerges from the lake and admits that the entire scheme was a set up to test the banana guard's sleuthing skills. Soon, the princess learns that Root Beer Guy was the one who actually solved the case, and she promotes him to head of the security force. Production The episode guest starred Anne Heche as Cherry Cream Soda. \\"Root Beer Guy\\" was written and storyboarded by guest artist Graham Falk, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. The basis for the episode was largely developed by Muto, who wrote the outline concerning a \\"Candy Kingdom everyman\\" whose life is changed after witnessing a crime. Pendarivs added the writer element to the character. Falk substantially fleshed out the story during the storyboarding process. This marked the second time that Falk had guest-storyboarded an episode of the series, after the earlier season five episode \\"Shh!\\" Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Muto. Pendarvis voiced the title character after Osborne and Muto suggested that he do it. Reportedly, the staff thought about asking horror writer Stephen King, but he was never approached. Pendarvis agreed to play the part and‚Äîbecause he lives in Mississippi‚Äîhe flew down in May 2013 to record his lines. Anne Heche was first considered to voice Cherry Cream Soda after Pendarvis noted that her character was similar to Maggie Pistone, a character that Heche had played in the 1997 crime film Donnie Brasco. Osborne, a noted fan of Heche, seconded the idea, and Heche was approached about the part. The episode also featured a vocal cameo by Christopher, a 14-year-old who was able to appear on the show thanks to the Make-a-Wish Foundation; he voiced Gum Drop Guy. Reception \\"Root Beer Guy\\" aired on December 2, 2013 on Cartoon Network. The episode was watched by 1.842 million viewers, and received a Nielsen household rating of 1.2. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 1.2 percent of all households at the time of the broadcast. The episode was the 4th most-watched episode aired by Cartoon Network for the week of December 2‚Äì8, 2013. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\", applauding the episode for both fully committing to parodying elements of detective fiction, and for introducing a likable character with a developed backstory. Sava also complimented Falk's storyboarding abilities, writing that the resultant episode \\"has a confident artistic voice that proudly caters to older viewers, using the tropes of crime fiction to tell a poignant story about one man‚Äôs desperate quest for purpose.\\" Eric Thurm of Complex called the episode \\"the perfect episode to show some skeptical of Adventure Time's storytelling skills.\\" He called the eponymous character \\"one of the best one-off characters the show has created\\", and cited the episode as an example of the series' ability to craft intricate, interesting, and developed characters.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Andy Ristaino and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, Adam Muto, and Moynihan. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on January 27, 2014. The episode guest stars Rainn Wilson as the eponymous character. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn meets an old sword-fighting robot named Rattleballs (voiced by Rainn Wilson), and learns that Rattleballs was part of an elite force made by Bubblegum long ago to protect the Candy Kingdom; however, the group became too destructive and so they were all destroyed, save for Rattleballs. After a short skirmish, Rattleballs proves that he is not a threat, so Bubblegum relents and does not destroy him. During the recording of \\"Rattleballs\\", Wilson brought his son to the session; DiMaggio noted it was odd because both he and Shada were excited to meet the actor due to his role in the American sitcom The Office, whereas Wilson and his son were in turn excited to meet them, because they were both fans of the show. The episode was viewed by 2.213 million viewers, and Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club applauded the episode for providing Rattleballs with a solid debut. Plot After his breakup with Flame Princess, Finn vows to do whatever Princess Bubblegum wishes. Soon, however, he becomes a burden, and Bubblegum orders Finn to take some time off and rest. Finn wanders to the junkyard, where he is saved from a collapse of garbage by a mysterious swordsman. They soon duel, but Finn is quickly defeated. However, after Finn shows remarkable bravery in defeat, the mysterious swordsman spares him, but heavily criticizes his dueling skills. The mysterious being is introduced as Rattleballs (voiced by Rainn Wilson), a hybrid gumball and robot warrior. He eventually agrees to take Finn on as his sword appreciative, and tells him about his past; he was originally a member of an elite police force created by Princess Bubblegum to patrol the Candy Kingdom, but once crime was largely eliminated, the robots became extremely violent and took to illegal street fighting. Bubblegum disbanded the entire contingent, although Rattleballs escaped and has been living in the junkyard ever since. Finn, torn between loyalty to the princess and his newfound sword master, eventually tells Bubblegum due to his chivalric code of honor. Bubblegum orders her banana guards to arrest Rattleballs, although he easily‚Äîthough non lethally‚Äîdefeats the entire police force. Bubblegum, realizing that Rattleballs may not be a threat, pretends to decommission the robot, but allows him to patrol the city at night, fighting crime. Production The episode guest starred Rainn Wilson as the titular Rattleballs. \\"Rattleballs\\" was written and storyboarded by Andy Ristaino and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Elizabeth Ito. Ward and Ristaino worked on developing the look for Rattleballs. Initially, Ristaino wanted Finn to have a sword that would \\"talk back to him and insult his swordsmanship\\", although this idea was later scrapped because of the introduction of the grass sword in the previous episode. Lead character designer Matt Forsythe helped develop the look for the \\"medieval banana guards\\"‚Äîwho had originally appeared in the early episode \\"The Vault\\"‚Äîa task he later called \\"fun\\". Forsythe also modeled one of the banana guards after a 14-year-old identified only as Chris, who had voiced a character in the episode \\"Root Beer Guy\\" by means of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The episode guest stars Rainn Wilson as the titular character. Wilson, a reported fan of the show, brought his son Walter to the recording session because he too was a fan. Both DiMaggio and Shada were excited to meet and work with WIlson, both being fans of the American television series The Office in which Wilson played the character Dwight Schrute; DiMaggio later noted that, \\"He was kind of geeking out on us, and [Jeremy and I] were kind of geeking out on him.\\" Reception \\"Rattleballs\\" aired on January 27, 2014 on Cartoon Network.

The episode was storyboarded by Seo Kim and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on February 10, 2014. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), with the help of Cinnamon Bun (Dee Bradley Baker) and Finn, tries to escape from an arranged marriage between her and Don John the Flame Lord (Roddy Piper), as set up by her father the Flame King (Keith David). Seo Kim and Somvilay Xayaphone wrote the episode from a synopsis devised by several other writers, including show creator Pendleton Ward. Piper and David, stars of They Live (1987), a John Carpenter film, lent their voices to two of the aforementioned characters. As an homage, the episode contains a parody from a popular combat sequence in the film, in which the actors box for close to six minutes. Meanwhile, background art was created by Derek Ballard, whose experience growing up in Utah inspired one of his pieces for the episode. Upon its airing \\"The Red Throne\\" was seen by 2.11 million viewers. Writers of entertainment- and education-related websites praised the episode for its writing and themes, as well as the performances by Piper and David. Despite this praise, the Adventure Time crew perceived its online response from fans to be largely negative. Plot In the Fire Kingdom, Don John the Flame Lord shows up to tell Flame Princess she is not brutish enough to rule over the Flame subjects. Her father, the Flame King, appears as his daughter is deprived of her body temperature and crown. He tells Flame Princess he has arranged her marriage with Don John. When she tries to escape their palace, its inhabitants ‚Äì put under a mind-control spell by Don John ‚Äì try to seize her. Cinnamon Bun, riding his wolf, punctures the palace walls. He rescues Flame Princess, and the two escape. They enlist the aid of Finn, the ex of Flame Princess. Still uneasy over their split, Finn tries to show off to Flame Princess, though she informs him that they should only remain friends. They return to the kingdom, its entrance now guarded by the inhabitants. Finn goes directly for the guards, but he and Flame Princess are quickly captured after she reveals to him that the people are being controlled through Don John's spell. Don John visits the imprisoned duo, where Flame Princess vows never to marry him. Don John complains to the Flame King that he is failing to deliver on his promise. The lord and king box, with the latter authority knocking out Don John, which frees the Flame people from his spell. Cinnamon Bun delivers a speech to the palace convincing the people to detain the Flame King and Don John while earning the affections of Flame Princess. Production Roddy Piper (pictured) voiceed the character Don John. \\"The Red Throne\\" was written by Seo Kim and Somvilay Xayaphone. A separate group of writers ‚Äì Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto ‚Äì came up with the idea for the episode, which Kim and Xayaphone then adapted into a storyboard. Employing other crew members, background artist Derek Ballard depicted a derelict van, a wrecked truck, and ruined musical instruments in one piece for the episode. This was inspired by his growing up in the desert of Utah. Since he himself was in a band, he would often let other bands temporarily stay at his house during their tours, often taking them to auto shops due to their vans and campers breaking down. The voice of Don John the Flame Lord was supplied by \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper, in unison with Keith David, who provided the voice of the Flame King. A distinguished wrestler and actor, Piper had appeared in numerous films. One of his most famous roles is that of the unnamed man (dubbed Nada) in They Live, directed by John Carpenter and released in 1988. A well-known scene in the film ‚Äì lasting for nearly six minutes ‚Äì features the man fighting with his friend (played by David), whom Nada wants to share his glasses with. This episode of Adventure Time includes a parody of this iconic scene, featuring Don John and the Flame King engaging in combat. The scene in They Live was previously the subject of spoofs in South Park and Saints Row IV, though the parody featured in Adventure Time was called exemplar for reuniting both Piper and David. WWE applauded one of Don John's lines (i.e. \\"My gym is magic, and my protein shake is rage!\\"), musing that it had likely been written with Piper's wrestling persona in mind. Release and reception Cartoon Network originally aired \\"The Red Throne\\" on February 10, 2014. 2.11 million people saw the episode live on broadcast; according to TV by the Numbers, 0.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-old residents of households with television sets watched the episode, as indicated by its Nielsen rating. The network released the episode on DVD, first in the year of that broadcast, as part of the Finn the Human box set, and later in 2015, as part of a box set for the complete fifth season. The Adventure Time crew was satisfied with the episode on its completion. In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on the Internet as largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A‚àí grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself. Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of Flame Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, as well as the nostalgia felt over such a relationship. Separate from romance, Sava interpreted the battle between the Flame Lord and the Flame King as to demonstrate Flame Princess is a more sensible ruler. The Huffington Post writer Cat Blake cited Cinnamon Bun gaining the affection of Flame Princess as a reason for secondary schoolers not to underestimate people. Staff writers of TV.com called this character progression for \\"seemingly one-note characters\\" a strength of the show, as similarly applied to the Ice King. Writing in DVD Talk, Adam Tyner described the episode as showing Finn at his most embarrassing. In memoriam of Piper, who died in July 2015, Brandon Stroud of Uproxx called Don Jon one of his best roles in pop culture. In the Official Tribute Commemorative Magazine for Piper, editor Jeff Ashworth and staff supposed that fans of the series were likely foreign to the \\"grizzly tones\\" of Piper's voice. The commemoration saw his guest role as showing his mastery of pop culture while calling Don Jon's bizarre fate normal in the show's universe.

Writers of entertainment-related publications praised the episode for its depth of mood and visuals. The New Yorker critic Emily Nussbaum, in particular, saw it as establishing Lumpy's intricacy as a character, and Eric Kohn in IndieWire called the episode the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of the show. Background Adventure Time follows the adventures of principal characters Finn the Human, aged 16, and Jake the Dog. Recurring characters featured in \\"Bad Timing\\" include Princess Bubblegum and Lumpy Space Princess.

Meanwhile, Lumpy (Pendleton Ward), portrayed as a valley girl, is the source of drama due to her arrogant personality and shallow relationships with others. Plot Princess Bubblegum demonstrates to company a device capable of time travel. Lumpy Space Princess comes in and demands Bubblegum transport Lumpy back to when she and her ex were still in love. Bubblegum explains that the machine is only capable of logging molecules of a given entity. Lumpy attacks her, and Bubblegum forces her to leave. Lamenting at a bar, she meets Johnnie (Mark Proksch), a former mate at their secondary school. Johnnie confesses his anxiety regarding a scheduled interview with Bubblegum for a business venture. Lumpy advises that he fix his posture as to appear more confident. Johnnie thanks Lumpy for her advice and invites her to his complex. Looking through Johnnie's record collection, Lumpy Space Princess finds a copy of Frank Zappa's album Apostrophe (') and plays a joke by putting the album cover (displaying Zappa's face) in front of her own face. As a result of their pleasant evening, the two fall in love and share good nights. When Johnnie finds Lumpy absent in the morning, he suspects that she has abandoned him. Much to his relief, he finds her waiting for breakfast in his kitchen. When he returns from the interview, he reveals he has been invited to a separate meeting with Bubblegum at her castle. Lumpy asks that she appear with him, but Johnnie says the meeting is private. Supposing Bubblegum has stolen his heart, Lumpy leaves in a fit of rage. Delivering a monologue on the passion necessary for love, Lumpy hurls a Molotov cocktail and hot-wiring a gas truck into the castle. Bubblegum considers its impact an attack on her kingdom and tells Johnnie to hide at the foot of their desk. When Lumpy finds Johnnie, she uses the device on him, attempting to revert him to when he loved her. Johnnie disappears; when Bubblegum figures out what has happened, she informs Lumpy that by failing to log his molecules, he no longer exists as part of their universe. To avoid having to grieve, Lumpy asks Bubblegum to use the device, properly, on her. Erased of her memory past her attacking Bubblegum, Lumpy storms out. Bubblegum pours herself a drink. Production This episode is the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the important events of the story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear in the margins of the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time travel device. Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame. \\"Bad Timing\\" was written by Pendleton Ward and Kent Osborne. They previously collaborated with Jack Pendarvis and Adam Muto to come up with the idea for the episode, with the former duo adapting that to a storyboard. The creator of Adventure Time, Ward resigned from his occupation as its runner during production of the season. Osborne is the head of story. Alluding to the episode, for Hulu, Muto and Osborne summarized it as Lumpy confounding the concept of time travel. The writers related the episode to \\"one of those situations where you run into someone from high school and you're like, 'Woah, why didn't I ever notice you before? Alluded to in this episode, the one it precedes involves time travel as well. Release and reception Cartoon Network originally aired \\"Bad Timing\\" on March 3, 2014. Over a million and a half people saw the episode live on broadcast. Television critic Emily Nussbaum gave this episode praise in The New Yorker, comparing it to a fairy tale characterized by laughter and sorrow. Kohn called its mood happy yet miserable the same, evoking more emotions as a whole than even the preceding episode. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava gave it an A grade, finding it, like Kohn, emotionally intense. Kohn praised the episode for supplying Lumpy, a usually arrogant character, with a tragic circumstance. Sava saw the character as more explored that way. Nussbaum, who considered the episode proof of her intricacy as a character, wrote that Lumpy appropriately shows pathos. Sava specifically lauded the monologue delivered by Lumpy for showing her consistent strength that makes her so admirable. He further praised how the episode was capable of condensing mature topics for children the show is aimed at in a humorous way. Kohn opined the episode helms the \\"waters of eroticism\\" responsibly. In the Adventure Time‚Äìdedicated podcast Conversation Parade, hosted by John Moe and Open Mike Eagle, Moe found Johnnie written so \\"incredibly complicated, whimsy, and sad\\" that he performed ‚Äì with the direction of guest Osborne ‚Äì some of his lines on the podcast. Kohn regarded its visuals as the pinnacle of the show. Sava wrote that the notion of time being a flat circle could have inspired the circular shape of the inner frame. He noted the use of color beyond the circle as a way to convey the many emotions evoked for the whole of the episode. Ignoring this device, Sava saw its use as humorous diversions while it contributed to the splendor. Nussbaum described the creatures appearing in the outer frame as annotative and a mute chorus, suggesting they live in a parallel universe of both connection and isolation. The episode was later released on DVD twice, first in the year of that broadcast, as part of the Princess Day box set, and later in 2015, as part of a box set for the complete fifth season. Home video critic Justin Remer called \\"Bad Timing\\" \\"surprisingly devastating\\" in DVD Talk. Kohn summed up the episode's climax as the pi√®ce de r√©sistance of Adventure Time.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on March 17, 2014. The episode guest stars Lou Ferrigno, Andy Samberg, and Mark Hamill; Castuera herself also voiced a character. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn finds Billy's (voiced by Ferrigno) bucket list and decides to complete the unfinished items, as a tribute toward the fallen hero. After completing most of the items, including giving Billy's ex-girlfriend Canyon (voiced by Castuera) one last motorcycle ride, and conquering his fear of the ocean, an apparition of Billy appears to Finn, telling him that Finn's biological father is still alive. The episode was the last to feature Castuera as a storyboard artist until her return to the series during the seventh season; in the interim time, she focused on her art career. This episode also marked the last time Nate Cash was credited as supervising director; he left to direct the animated mini-series Over the Garden Wall. \\"Billy's Bucket List\\" was met with critical acclaim, with one reviewer complimenting the episode's cliffhanger and emotional growth. In addition, the episode was watched by 2.335 million viewers. Plot During a freestyle rap battle with Rap Bear, hosted by Party Pat (voiced by Andy Samberg), Finn is approached by Billy's (voiced by Lou Ferrigno) ex-girlfriend, Canyon (voiced by Ako Castuera). She delivers Billy's loincloth to Finn, and Finn and she venture back to Billy's lair to pay their respects and move on. At his cavern, Finn defeats a group of fairies and then discovers a bucket list penned by Billy. Canyon and Finn decide to complete it as a tribute to the fallen hero. The two go on a joy ride in a desert environment, and afterwards Canyon and Finn part ways. Finn soon discovers that the list contains one more item hidden at the bottom left corner reading: \\"Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float.\\" Finn, terrified of the ocean, decides to do this final task for Billy, but the Fear Feaster (voiced by Mark Hamill) manifests and taunts him, until he knocks himself unconscious; during this time, he has an intense dream of swimming through the ocean and being consumed by a whale. Eventually he wakes up, and ‚Äî possibly involuntarily ‚Äî uses his grass sword to slice through and destroy the Fear Feaster, ending Finn's ocean fear for good. The spirit of Billy manifests itself before Finn in the sky, thanking him for completing his list. Before his spirit departs, he reveals to Finn that his human father is still alive, trapped in a mysterious place known only as the \\"Citadel\\". Production Lou Ferrigno reprised his role as Billy for this episode. \\"Billy's Bucket List\\" was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. This episode was the last to feature Castuera‚Äîwho had been storyboarding on the show since the first season finale \\"Gut Grinder\\"‚Äîuntil her return to the series during the seventh season. According to Moynihan, Castuera left the show \\"to do something different and pursue other interests\\" as well as to \\"pursue a different path from television animation.\\" On September 29, 2014, however, Kent Osborne posted an image on Instagram, confirming that Castuera and Moynihan would again be partners for the seventh season. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was cohelmed by Nate Cash and Adam Muto. This episode marked the last time Nate Cash was credited as supervising director, as he later left the series to direct the animated mini-series Over the Garden Wall. Castuera herself voiced Canyon. The episode also features the return of Lou Ferrigno as the hero Billy; Ferrigno had previously appeared in the first-season episode \\"His Hero\\" and the fourth season finale \\"The Lich\\". In addition, both comedian and rapper Andy Samberg, as well as actor Mark Hamill, reprise their roles as Party Pat and the Fear Feaster, respectively. Samberg had previously voiced the character in the second season episode \\"Belly of the Beast\\", whereas Hamill had appeared in the first-season episode, \\"Ocean of Fear\\". The rap battle music was scored by Moynihan, who made heavy use of orchestra hits. The instrumental was later uploaded to SoundCloud and shared by the official Adventure Time production blog. In one of the episode's background art pieces, artist Derek Ballard inserted a buried car, homemade bombs, and a hole in the side of a cliff, additions that he claims were in honor of \\"one of America‚Äôs greatest film treasures: Tremors\\". Reception \\"Billy's Bucket List\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on March 17, 2014. The episode was viewed by 2.335 million viewers and scored a 0.5 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.5 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. Furthermore, the episode was the 43rd most- watched cable program on the night it aired. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\", arguing that it was an example of the series' continued growth: he wrote, \\"as Finn grows, so does this series\\". Sava opined that, \\"the final minute of ‚ÄúBilly‚Äôs Bucket List‚Äù drops a major plot-bomb that gives the series an exciting direction for next season, and while the events leading up to the cliffhanger aren't quite as provocative or substantial as the last few episodes, they represent all the things that make this show such a great 10-minute oasis at the beginning of the week.\\" Sava also noted that, \\"Trippy psychedelia is another major ingredient of this series, and 'Billy‚Äôs Bucket List' delivers a heavy serving when Finn finds himself underwater.\\" Andrea Reiher of Zap2it called the episode \\"a great ending to Season 5\\". Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly awarded the episode an \\"A\\", noting that while the series \\"can do hilarious weirdness in its sleep,\\" this episode in particular \\"showcases its soulfulness\\". He described the main plot as \\"oddly introspective\\", and wrote that the end was \\"a surprise reveal‚Äîa mythology boost that could push the show in a radical new direction.\\" Explanatory notes References External links  2014 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 5) episodes ","title":"Billy's Bucket List"},{"id":"42534246","text":"Elizabeth Ann Sackler (born February 19, 1948) is an American public historian and arts activist.

In 1997, Sackler received her PhD with a concentration in public history from Union Institute & University.  Career  = Early work = In 1992, Sackler became frustrated with Sotheby's refusal to repatriate Native American ceremonial masks, so she purchased them and returned them to their tribes of origin. This led her to become interested in art and social justice issues for American Indians, which led her to become the founding president of the American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation. She is also President of The Arthur M. Sackler Foundation and the Elizabeth A. Sackler Foundation. = Brooklyn Museum = In 2007, she founded the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, the first museum center devoted to female artists and feminist art, located at the Brooklyn Museum. A centerpiece of the center's collection is Judy Chicago's installation of her work, The Dinner Party, which is located at the Brooklyn Museum. Sackler and Chicago had been friends since the 1970s. In June 2014, Sackler became the first woman to be elected Chairman by the Brooklyn Museum Board of Trustees, a position she held until June 2016. She has served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Brooklyn Museum since 2000. More recently, Sackler's work has focused on issues related to women in prison, including the program series States of Denial: The Illegal Incarceration of Women, Children, and People of Color as well as the exhibition Women of York: Shared Dining, both at the Brooklyn Museum's Elizabeth A.

In response, Elizabeth Sackler claimed that neither she, nor her children, ‚Äúbenefited in any way‚Äù from the sale of Oxycontin or ever held shares in Purdue Pharma. Articles confirmed that her father's option in a different pharmaceutical company, Purdue Frederick, were sold shortly after his death in 1987, to Purdue Pharma owners Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, years before the advent of Oxycontin. Online outlet, Hyperallergic, reviewed legal documents confirming her statement and later articles in the New York Times, Associated Press, and other outlets published clarifications and corrections all confirming her branch of the family's separation from Purdue Pharma and all Oxycontin profits. Elizabeth Sackler said she admired Nan Goldin and all activists seeking to hold Purdue accountable for \\"morally abhorrent\\" behavior.

It was fought on 25 September 1767 between the allied forces led by the East India Company and troops of Hyder Ali. The allied forces of the English army were led by Colonel Smith. Background During the eighteenth century, the Indian subcontinent under the control of the Mughul Empire lost its territory with the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. The empire split among viceroys and other local rulers with bitter fight among each other.Bowring 1899, pp. 19‚Äì23 In the 1740s and 1750s French and British colonial companies became more active in these local conflicts, and by the Third Carnatic War (1757‚Äì1763), the British gained Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta and emerged single largest among other colonial powers. Their eastern holdings at Madras were strongly influenced by treaties with the Nawab of Carnatic, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, whose territory surrounded Madras. The other major powers in the east were the Nizam of Hyderabad, formerly a viceroyalty of the Mughul Empire but declared independent in the 1720s, held in the 1760s by Asaf Jah II, and the Sultanate of Mysore, which occupied the high plains between the Eastern and Western Ghats, the mountain ranges separating the coastal plains of India from the interior. Nominally ruled by the Wodeyar dynasty, control of Mysore had in 1761 come into the hands of Hyder Ali, a Muslim military leader.Bowring 1899, p. 33 Each of these powers intrigued with and against the others, and sought to draw the power of the French and British colonial companies to serve their objectives. The colonial powers sought to influence the local powers to gain either direct control of territory, or the revenues from territory nominally controlled by a local ruler beholden to them for financial and military support. Since European military training was significantly better than local practices, small numbers of disciplined European or European-trained forces could defeat significantly larger Indian armies composed mainly of poorly trained infantry and cavalry.Duff 1878, pp. 607‚Äì608 The battle The Battle of Tiruvannamalai is one of the two successful battles fought by the Madras Army in the Carnatic along with the Battle of Chengam. The allied forces of Hyder Ali were invaded by the British Army under Colonel Smith in Chengam on 3 September 1767. The English Army had an upper hand in the battle. A second battle, the Battle of Tiruvannamalai took place on 25 September 1767 that lasted 2 days. It was fought on 25 September 1767 between the troops of East India Company and troops of Hyder Ali. The allied forces of the English army was led by Colonel Smith.Tritton 2013, pp. 90-91 The Nawab's army lost 4,000 men and 64 guns in the battle. After a brief tussle for a couple of years, Tipu Sultan captured Tiruvannamalai.Illustrated guide to Southern Railway 1900, p. 304 After losing the battle, Hyder Ali offered peace with the British Army, which was denied. He then collated all his army and had another fight that led him close to capture of Madras within a distance of 5 miles. The British had a peace treaty during April 1769 with the status quo ante bellum. The treaty also laid terms for mutual aid and end of defensive alliance.Tucker 2009, p. 794 Notes References   * Anglo-Mysore Anglo-Mysore War, 1st Anglo-Mysore 1 Anglo-Mysore 1 Anglo-Mysore 01 Ang 1767 in India ","title":"Battle of Tiruvannamalai"},{"id":"42534254","text":"\\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" are the first two episodes of the sixth season of the American animated television series Adventure Time. \\"Wake Up\\" was written and storyboarded by Andy Ristaino and Cole Sanchez, whereas \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard. Both episodes' stories were developed by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. The two episodes originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 21, 2014. The episodes guest star Kumail Nanjiani as Prismo, M. Emmet Walsh as the Cosmic Owl, Miguel Ferrer as Death, Ron Perlman as the Lich, and Stephen Root as Martin. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In \\"Wake Up\\", Finn and Jake try to commit a cosmic crime in order to gain access to a multiverse prison called the Citadel to meet Finn's father is trapped. Prismo (voiced by Nanjiani) offers to help them, but he is murdered by the Lich (voiced by Perlman). In \\"Escape from the Citadel\\", Jake, Finn, and the Lich are transported to the Citadel, where Finn and Jake meet Martin (voiced by Root), Finn's father, who is not what Finn expected. The three are forced to run from the Lich, as he begins to destroy the Citadel. At this time, Martin flees, and Finn tries to give chase, but his grass sword takes over his entire arm, causing Finn to lose it. Despite Finn's loss of his father and limb, Finn and Jake are vindicated when the Lich is turned into a giant baby. Both \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Escape from the Citadel\\", were met with critical acclaim. Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times felt that the episode was exciting, whereas Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club applauded the episode's use of humor as a way of balancing out the heavier aspects of the plot. Many of the reviews also praised Nanjiani's return as Prismo. Reviews were also complimentary towards the darker nature of \\"Escape from the Citadel\\". Both episodes were watched by 3.321 million viewers. Plot =\\"Wake Up\\"= Jake is partying with Prismo (voiced by Kumail Nanjiani). At the party, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) and Death (voiced by Miguel Ferrer) note the Lich (voiced by Ron Perlman) is sitting ominously in the corner. Prismo explains that, after the events of an earlier episode, the Lich, an entity driven by the pursuit of causing mass death, is now harmless, functioning like a machine without a purpose. Later, Finn confronts Jake about the revelation that his father is still alive. Jake convinces him to ask Prismo to send them to the Citadel. Prismo explains that the Citadel is a prison, and the only way to gain access to the Citadel is to commit a cosmic crime; he instructs Finn and Jake to find and wake a certain old man who is asleep in the debris surrounding his Time Room. It is revealed that this man is the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake are familiar with is merely a dream. Prismo explains that killing a wishmaster‚Äîas in, waking up the man‚Äîis a cosmic crime, but that he will return when his corporal body falls back asleep. At that instant, the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase. =\\"Escape from the Citadel\\"= Finn and Jake grab hold of the captured Lich as he is transported to the Citadel. Once there, they discover a human figure encased in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin. However, Finn starts to realize that his father is not the hero that he thought he would be. Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save himself and the Lich appears, ordering Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now been turned into a large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house. Production \\"Wake Up\\" was written and storyboarded by Andy Ristaino and Cole Sanchez, whereas \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" was storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard; both episodes' stories were developed by Kent Osborne, Pendleton Ward, Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was handled by Elizabeth Ito (for \\"Wake Up\\") and Muto (for \\"Escape from the Citadel\\"). The design for the Citadel, which is featured in both episodes, was crafted by Herpich, who used Google SketchUp to design a 3-D model of the structure. \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" featured the introduction of Finn's father, Martin. Because previous episodes illustrated that Finn had had good and loving adoptive parents in Joshua and Maraget, the writers for the series wanted to craft Martin so that he would not be a \\"carbon copy\\" of his son. Wolfhard pushed for the idea that Martin would be \\"as roguish and dishonorable as Finn is heroic\\". According to Muto, Martin's design \\"was based on [Wolfhard's] impression of Sean Connery's costume in [the 1974 film] Zardoz without having seen the movie.\\" \\"Wake Up\\" featured the return of Kumail Nanjiani as Prismo, M. Emmet Walsh as the Cosmic Owl, and Miguel Ferrer as Death and one of the heads of Grob Gob Glob Grod. Martin is voiced by Stephen Root. Root had previously voiced the characters Grimby and the Royal Tart Toter in the second season episode \\"The Other Tarts\\". Ethan Maher voiced the baby version of the Lich. Herpich himself played the part of the Void Caster. Cultural references When the Lich is addressing Finn, he refers to the escaped criminals as \\"Ancients\\", a reference to one of the many name for deities in H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club wrote that the transformation of Finn's arm was similar to Tetsuo Shima's transformation in the anime Akira. Jason Krell of io9 noted parallels between the scene immediately following the loss of Finn's arm and the end of the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. Reception \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Escape from the Citadel\\", first aired on Cartoon Network on April 21, 2014. The episodes were viewed by 3.321 million viewers and scored a 0.7 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year- old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episodes were seen by 0.7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds who were watching television at the time of the episodes' airing. Furthermore, the episode was the 23rd most-watched cable program on the night it aired. These episodes were the last to have been watched by over 3 million viewers. Both episodes received largely positive reviews from television critics. Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times, wrote that \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" form a \\"beautiful, strange and exciting\\" two-part special episode of the series. He specifically cited the plot as a highlight, as well as the return to the series by Nanjiani as Prismo. Eric Kohn of IndieWire awarded both this episode and \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" an \\"A‚Äì\\", writing that while the episode featured extremely dark material, it was never presented in a way so as to drive viewers away. Kohn wrote highly of the comedy and naturalistic dialogue that took place during Prismo's opening party in \\"Wake Up\\", and felt that the addition about Prismo's origins helped the show slip \\"in a certain wise gaze [concerning] the fog of time\\". In regards to \\"Escape from the Citadel\\", he also noted that \\"the fate of the Lich takes an amusing new turn,\\" and that the storyline concerning \\"Finn's cursed sword arm‚Äîan ingredient that has festered in the sidelines for weeks‚Äîreaches a beguiling new state.\\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" an \\"A\\". Sava praised Nanjiani's \\"delightfully low- key\\" performance in the former, noting that his \\"soft, smooth voice is perfect for a character that is so laid back he's completely flat, and his casual delivery of ominous lines helps keep the tone light as the material gets heavier.\\" Furthermore, he noted that the jokes were more pronounced in this episode, making the opening scene during Prismo's party that much funnier. Sava felt that the Lich's monologue to Finn in \\"Escape from the Citadel\\" was \\"even creepier thanks to Ron Perlman's gravely voice for The Lich and the evocative staging by writers/storyboard artists Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard\\", who were able to \\"achieve a fascinating combination of terror and hope when Finn touches The Lich with Guardian blood and starts a grotesquely stunning transformation that strips the villain of his power by making him a giant baby.\\" Sava also complimented the episode for being full of harsh realizations concerning Finn's father and the vulnerability of his body. Ultimately he concluded that \\"the developments of these two episodes dramatically alter the series' status quo to give this season an added boost of momentum from the very beginning.\\" Explanatory notes References External links   2014 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 6) episodes ","title":"Wake Up / Escape from the Citadel"},{"id":"42534263","text":"The Pavilh√£o Multiusos do Kilamba (Multi-use Pavilion of Kilamba), also called Arena do Kilamba (Kilamba Arena), is a state-owned multi-purpose indoor arena used mostly for basketball in Luanda, Angola.

Mendoza studied political science at the University of Costa Rica. As a student, he was disillusioned with the Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC for its Spanish initials) and the National Liberation Party (PLN for its Spanish initials), the two ruling parties of Costa Rica. As such, he became involved with Gente U, a leftist student group. In 1996, he traveled to Switzerland to work on an ecumenical council associated with the World Council of Churches. That same year, he traveled to Germany as a volunteer with the Hendrik Kraemer Haus, helping refugees. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a Master's in communication. Mendoza has cited the works of the '40s generation as having an impact on his political and social development. Public service career In 1999, Mendoza began working for the National Ombudsman's office. When PAC was formed in 2001, Mendoza joined and has been a member ever since. From 2002 to 2006, Mendoza worked as an adviser to deputy Rodrigo Alberto Carazo Zeled√≥n. From 2006 to 2010, he worked as an adviser to deputy Leda Zamora. During both advisory stints, Mendoza specialized in public budgeting and the defense of national institutions that create public opportunities. In February 2010, he was elected deputy. He served on the Economic Affairs, International Relations, Overseas Commerce, Human Rights, and Electric commissions. He was the leader of the PAC deputies during his first year in office, and in his second year he was elected president of the Legislative Assembly, winning with 31 votes from five different parties. Mendoza allied PAC with other parties to create the Alliance for Costa Rica (Alianza por Costa Rica), an opposition coalition. In this role, Mendoza fought against President Laura Chinchilla's tax plan, attempts to raise the salaries of deputies, and attempts to deregulate the energy market to allow more private investments. Additionally, Mendoza cut spending by deputies, installed GPS in the Assembly's car to track unlawful use, supported water rights, and rights for indigenous people and the LGBT population. In April 2014, President-elect Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s announced Mendoza as the next Costa Rican Ambassador to the United Nations. 2014 presidential primary and campaign Mendoza was the first PAC candidate to enroll in the party's presidential primary in 2013. Running against Luis Guillermo Sol√≠s, Epsy Campbell Barr, and Ronald Sol√≠s Bola√±os, Mendoza gained only 113 fewer votes than Sol√≠s. The primary campaign was hotly contested but not bitter. Sol√≠s considered Mendoza as a vice presidential candidate before settling on Ana Helena Chac√≥n and Helio Fallas.

After college he worked variously as a draughtsman, teacher, lecturer and researcher in the United States, in Germany and elsewhere. He is chiefly remembered as one of six Founders of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in 1873. Early life Xenos Young Clark, a native of Boston, Massachusetts, was born in 1855. His fellow Founder, Brooks, used to say that he was \\"a brilliant son of a brilliant father\\". --His father had been a personal assistant to Agassiz, later adjunct professor of zoology at Harvard. (p. 18) His father's final posting was at Massachusetts Agricultural College - \\"Aggie\\" - where he built the first house upon Mount Pleasant Hill. His son, enrolling, brought to Aggie a \\"splendid mind and a facile pencil, the latter indeed instigating many a college joke.\\" (p. 23) Barrett characterized him as \\"lovable in all his ways, a genius, brilliant, versatile, perhaps erratic.\\" Clark had received much of his early schooling in the preparatory department of Kentucky University, of Harrodsburg and then Lexington, KY,This school was a private baptist-sponsored college, originally established as Bacon College in Georgetown, KY, in 1836. The school moved to Harrodsburg, KY in 1839, then closed briefly in 1850 while seeking backers. A past president of the college operated a preparatory high school under the Bacon name between 1850-55+. The college was re-established as Kentucky University in 1858, in Harrodsburg, but by 1860 the Civil war again forced it to close. At the end of the war the school was moved to Lexington where, in 1865 it merged with Transylvania University. prior to his family's move to Amherst. He was twenty-one years of age in 1873, and a sophomore, when he and five others began their lifelong bond in the rooms, laboratories, sheds and fields of Old North College, one of the three principal buildings at M.A.C. (p. 23) Old North College, the dorm and classroom building where Phi Sigma Kappa was founded on March 15, 1873. \\"The Shrine,\\" a memorial to Clark and the other five Founders, is visible adjacent to the front doorway. Collegiate activities Clark was a good student, and a busy one. While at \\"Aggie,\\" Clark was a member of the Washington Irving Literary Society, a popular pastime among the undergraduates, and was an editor of the 1875 version of the college yearbook. He was third baseman of the class nine, an early baseball formation. His peers honored Clark by election as vice-president of his class. In fact he ranked third in his class in 1875 when he left due to 'chronic illness.' But among all these activities and honors, it was his role as a Founder of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in his Sophomore year by which he is best remembered today. Clark's formative participation in the endeavor was without question: He and Clay invented the symbolism of the order. \\"In fact, Clark's was the eager ear which first learned of Jabez William Clay's bold Idea, and these men together eagerly advanced it to the rest.\\" In 1903, years later, Founder Campbell recalled, \\"I think it is conceded by all the original number that Jabez W. Clay was the first man to suggest the formation of the Order, and I dare say that Xenos Y. Clark may have been the first person he broached the subject to\\" (p. 24) Generally the Founders were quick to praise each other's contribution with equanimity, acknowledging that each provided an important element to the whole. In those early years, while popular, Clark was never president of the as-yet-unnamed Society, demurring from such service possibly because of his illness, reported as kidney disease. (p. 27) After graduation Clark gave the formal obituary address for his friend, Clay, who died in 1880. Xenos Young Clark himself died in Amherst on June 4, 1889 at his home at the age of 34, succumbing to the chronic illness which he had battled all his life.(p. 68), page 29. Rand's History said of Clark some years after his death: > \\"A man of much personal charm and unusual ability, he had yet failed to > establish himself in any permanent way. There was an element of pathos in > his career. He had fallen in love with a cousin of his classmate Brooks, but > their marriage was so violently opposed by her guardian . . . that she took > her own life, and he became more than ever a restless wanderer going to and > fro up and down the earth.

Originally designated as the BMD-3M, the chassis of the BMD-4 is the same as that of the BMD-3, because it was developed on the same basis. This armored fighting vehicle is one of the lightest and one of the most heavily armed in its class, possessing a substantial amount of firepower in comparison to its counterparts. The vehicle was designed to transport Russian Airborne Troops (VDV); increasing its mobility, armament, and protection on the battlefield. Many components of the vehicle, such as the ergonomics and positioning of the passengers, remain relatively unchanged. Primary differences between the BMD-4 and its predecessors lie in its armament. The vehicle is fitted with the Bakhcha-U turret, which consists of: a 100 mm 2A70 low-pressure rifled gun, a 30 mm 2A72 coaxial autocannon, and a 7.62 mm PKT coaxial machine gun. The 2A70 rifled cannon is capable of firing high explosive fragmentation rounds and laser guided anti-tank missiles. It also features secondary weapons designed to engage and destroy enemy infantry and armored fighting vehicles. The automated fire control system of the vehicle is advanced with new features that simplify the use of the vehicle's armament by the gunner and commander. The vehicle is designed by the Volgograd tractor factory and the armament was developed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau unitary enterprise located in Tula. Kurganmashzavod is the official manufacturer of the vehicle. The only operator of the BMD-4 is Russia, where it entered service in late 2004 and has been produced ever since then. In 2008, a modernized version, designated as the BMD-4M, was introduced with significant contributions from Kurganmashzavod; the designer of the BMP. Production The BMD-4 was adopted by the Russian Armed Forces on December 31, 2004. In August 2005, the 106th Guards Airborne Division received the first batch of these vehicles, with 60 vehicles being produced. In 2010, all further purchases of the BMD-4 with the \\"Bakhcha-U\\" turret were cancelled along with the 2S25. It was later noted by Colonel Gennady Anashkin that the BMD-4 will still enter service due to the vehicle being a completely new generation essential for the VDV. VDV commander Vladimir Shamanov told in an interview that the original BMD-4 possessed an unreliable base while the modernized BMD-4M is more than satisfying for the Russian airborne troops. On March 21, 2008, Kurganmashzavod unveiled a modernized variant of the vehicle that was designated as the BMD-4M. The primary cause of the alterations was due to the bankruptcy of the original manufacturer, the Volgograd tractor factory. In 2008, it was planned to carry out comprehensive testing of a modernized BMD-4 program agreed with the Chief Armor Management (Bolshoi) of the Ministry of Defense and the VDV. According to test results and Mikhail Bolotin, the president of Concern Tractor Plants (KTZ), mass production was initially planned for the following year. The mass production of the modernized BMD-4 was later postponed along with the 2S25 Sprut-SD. Nikolay Makarov, the Chief of the General Staff of Russian Armed Forces, dismissed the BMD-4 as \\"a version of the BMP-3\\" with no protection and costs more than an expensive tank. In August 2012, Alexander Sukhorukov, who was then deputy Defense Minister, said that the BMD-4N armored vehicle does not meet the requirements put forward by the Russian military department, and will not be purchased. At the same time, a week before, Vladimir Shamanov said the BMD-4M is fully compliant with the VDV, which was more important in this regard than the requirements of the Ministry of Defence. He stressed that the fate of the BMD-4M is decided by the supreme commander, Vladimir Putin. The Russian Army received another prototype batch of the modernised BMD-4M airborne assault vehicle during mid-2014. Eight modernized BMD-4M vehicles were delivered to the 106th Guards Airborne Assault Division by Kurganmashzavod, where the vehicles continued to undergo testing. \\"The vehicles proved themselves as technology of the future: they roved in differing climatic conditions, airdropped, tested in water, including being redeployed at sea. All of this was noted by the commission, which recommended to supply the VDV [with the vehicles] this year as a result of testing,\\" Maj. Gen. Andrei Kholzakov, deputy commander of VDV, said on January 15, 2015. Kholzakov added that the decision of the state commission came as field tests of BMD-4M airborne fighting vehicles and BTR-MD Rakushka armored personnel carriers concluded successfully in 2014. The BMD-4M, as well as the BTR-MDM, were officially brought into service in April 2016.BMD-4M and BTR-MDM airborne armoured vehicles enter officially in service with Russian army - Armyrecognition.com, 30 April 2016 Design =Hull= The hull of the BMD-4 bears a strong resemblance to the hull of the BMD-3 but with a number of innovations. The BMD-4 has a crew of three consisting of: a vehicle commander, a gunner, and a driver. It can carry up to five passengers and is more spacious than the original BMD-1 and BMD-2. The suspension is composed of six small road wheels and four track rollers on each side. The vehicle has an automatic transmission with five gears for forward and five gears for backwards. =Armament= Primary Close-up of the turret and the primary armament Both primary armaments of the BMD-4 are fitted into one turret known as the Bakhcha-U (Russian: –ë–∞—Ö—á–∞-–£; \\"Melon field\\") consisting of: a 100 mm 2A70 rifled gun, a coaxial 30 mm 2A72 autocannon, and a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun. This module is designed by the KBP Instrument Design Bureau for motorized infantry units without the support of tanks and artillery. The Bakhcha-U turret is installable on the chassis of other military vehicles, such as the BMP-2, BMP-3, and BTR-90. This turret has a full 360¬∞ traverse and a maximum elevation of 60¬∞; the maximum depression is ‚àí6¬∞. The majority of armored and unarmored targets can be engaged by at least two types of armament provided by the Bakhcha-U turret. The 2A70 rifled gun is capable of firing guided and unguided shells. 34 ready-to-use unguided HE-Frag shells are carried in the turret of the vehicle. The 100 mm gun is fitted with an autoloader that fires at a rate of 10-12 rounds per minute, with the time of each shell loading being 5‚Äì6 seconds. The two variants of HE-Frag shells available for the Bakhcha-U are the 3UOF17 and 3UOF19; the former having a muzzle velocity of 250 m/s with the latter achieving 355 m/s. The 3UOF19 also provides a substantially larger proximity detonation which increases the lethal radius of the explosion. When implemented in the Bakhcha-U turret, the range of the 2A70 is increased to 7 km with its unguided rounds. A 30 mm 2A72 autocannon is mounted coaxially with the 2A70 rifled gun. The turret of the BMD-4 contains a total of 500 rounds ready to be used by its autocannon with 245 of them being high explosive and the remaining being armor-piercing discarding sabot. This autocannon fires projectiles with a muzzle velocity of 1120 m/s and a cyclic rate of fire of 350‚Äì400 rds/min. The rounds fired can penetrate 22 mm of Rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) from a range of 2000 m while impacting at an angle of 60¬∞. Minimum gas contamination of the turret is achieved by a delayed unlocking due to single-barrel long recoil action and forward case ejection. The 7.62 mm PKT machine gun is mounted coaxially with 100 mm and 30 mm weapons. 2000 rounds are carried in the turret for the PKT machine gun; all combined into one belt to eliminate reloading. The 100 mm tank gun is also capable of firing the 9M117M1 Arkan anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) which is a further development of the 9M117 Bastion (NATO reporting name: AT-10 Stabber). With a weight of 21.5 kg, this ATGM has a penetration value of 750‚Äì800 mm of RHA behind explosive reactive armor (ERA). The turret holds four 9M117M1 missiles and is launched through the 100 mm gun ensuring a crucial advantage due to the loading being completely internal rather than external unlike other infantry fighting vehicles. While traveling at an average speed of 300 m/s, the Arkan is guided via laser beam riding and is capable of destroying targets up to 5.5 km away. Secondary As one of the most heavily armed IFVs, the BMD-4 possesses multiple secondary armaments. These secondary weapons include a 7.62 mm PKT machine gun, and a 9P135M launcher post capable of firing additional anti tank missiles. The PKT is operated by passenger seated towards the front and bow mounted towards the left. This bow mounted weapon is dismountable and man portable for increased versatility. The 9P135M missile launcher is mounted towards the roof and is also dismountable. The RPK-74 is bow mounted towards the right side of the vehicle. It has a maximum range of 800 m and fires 5.45x39mm rounds which are also used by the standard AK-74 Kalashnikov in service with the Russian armed forces. Additional ATGMs can be operated by the BMD-4. This is made possible by the 9P135M launcher post that fires the wire guided Fagot (NATO reporting name: AT-4 Spigot) and Konkurs (NATO reporting name: AT-5 Spandrel) missiles. The Fagot missile is a short range ATGM with an effective range of 2 km. While flying at an average speed of 186 m/s, it penetrates 480 mm of RHA. The Fagot-M is an improved variant that has an increased effective range of 2.5 km and a penetration of 550 mm of RHA. The Konkurs missile has an effective range of 4000 m and flies at an average speed of 206 m/s. The original Konkurs missile penetrates 750‚Äì800 mm of RHA while the improved Konkurs-M penetrates 750‚Äì800 mm of RHA after ERA due to an additional tandem warhead. The firing range is reduced to 2500 m during night time. =Protection= The weight of the BMD-4 is achieved by using aluminum alloy for the hull instead of steel as armor. This armor protects the BMD-4 from 30 mm weapons like its own 2A72 autocannon towards the front, and small arms fire and shell splinters towards the side. To counter infrared guidance and weapons, six 81 mm ZD6 smoke grenade dischargers in two banks of three are mounted towards the sides of the turret. An NBC protection system and automatic fire suppression systems are provided to the entire crew and passengers to ensure survivability in an environment with nuclear fallout. =Fire control system and sensors= The BMD-4 features an advanced fire control system (FCS). The unique armament system provided by the Bakhcha-U and the reliable ride performance provided by the chassis gives the BMD-4 qualitatively new capabilities to units of land forces. The BMD-4 is able to fire all its primary armaments effectively regardless of whether the vehicle is stationary or mobile, whether the time is day or night, or whether it is afloat or land based. The FCS implements a significant increase of the armament effectiveness by engaging a wide scope of targets in complicated weather and landscape conditions. Advanced ballistic calculations allow the BMD-4 to fire from an enclosed position and the capability of effectively firing at low and slow aerial targets is provided. The computerized FCS of the BMD-4 is automated by day and night and features two advanced optical sights for both the commander and gunner. The IFV commander's panoramic sight has an azimuth coverage of 360¬∞ to search for targets. This panoramic sight features thermal imaging and range finding channels with a range of up to 10 km. The gunner's sight provides for firing all types of armament by day and night with a range finding sight of 10 km. This sight is combined with visual imaging, thermal imaging, range-finding channels, and a missile guidance channel. With two dedicated sights for both operators of the Bakhcha-U, the BMD-4 has hunter-killer capabilities and the gunner is able to use the commander's sight to engage targets if his own sight is disabled or destroyed. The commander of the vehicle also has the ability to override the command and to take control of the turret and gun from the gunner with both turret operators having complete control of the armaments. =Mobility= Like its predecessor, the BMD-4 is capable of parachuting from aircraft with the entire crew and passengers inside the vehicle which allows target engagement after landing to be instant. An Il-76 is able to transport two of these vehicles at a time in comparison to three BMD-1s and BMD-2s. Its engine is the 2V-06-2; the same as the BMD-3. This engine develops a total power of 450 horsepower (hp). The BMD-4 is also fully amphibious with two water jets mounted on each side of the back of the hull and can swim at speeds of up to 10 km/h in a Beaufort scale of 2. With a high power-to-weight ratio, the BMD-4 features superior acceleration in comparison to other infantry fighting vehicles. The maximum speed on a highway is 70 km/h and the BMD-4 can maneuver on a 60¬∞ gradient and a 35¬∞ side slope. The BMD-4 can cross 1.8 m trenches and climb 0.8 m tall obstacles. This vehicle's suspension is hydropneumatic and giving an adjustable ground clearing of 130‚Äì530 mm with the normal road clearance being 450 mm. The clearance is changed by the driver and can be changed within 10 seconds. Variants BMD-4M with additional protection.

Army Recognition. 17 January 2019. =BMD-4M= Armored personnel carrier based on BMD-4M The BMD-4M was unveiled by Kurganmashzavod in 2008. This vehicle retains the Bakhcha-U turret with a number of other innovations. Overall bulletproof crew protection is ensured. Special lightweight and durable alloys make this possible without the vehicle losing its ability to swim or be airdropped. The more powerful and compact engine of the BMP-3 is integrated into the BMD-4M; providing 500 hp. In general, the unification of units, plants, and systems of the modernized BMD-4 chassis with the same units, plants and systems of BMP-3 is 80%. This decreases the expenses of the airborne assault vehicle servicing in the army allowing a significant reduction of service maintenance of airborne combat vehicles in the army. =BMD-4M Sinitsa= The BMD-4M Sinitsa was unveiled in 2017. This vehicle has the Sinitsa turret combat module fitted with a top- mounted panoramic sight with a thermal imaging channel and housing a 100 mm 2A70 tank gun/ATGM launcher, 30 mm 2A72 autocannon and a 7.62mm PKMS medium machine gun.

History  The Deutsche Schule der Borrom√§erinnen in Kairo was founded in 1904, after the success of its sister school in Alexandria, which was founded in 1884 to educate Germans and Austrians, whose parents were working in Alexandria at the time. The school is led by the Kongregation der Barmherzigen Schwestern vom heiligen Karl Borrom√§us (Congregation of the Nuns of Saint Karl Borrom√§us). The newly founded school acquired a building in Bab El-Louk as well as property in Maadi, where its preschool is now located. In 1915 during World War I, the school was forced to close with 300 students. After 8 years the school reopened with only 60 students. After the school reopened, the number of Egyptian students started to rise. By 1946 the school only accepted female students. The school became an all girls school to this day. DSB Kairo is a member of the Deutsche Ausslandsschulen International. It consists of Kindergarten, Vorschule, Grundschule and Gymnasium. Most of its teachers are either German or Egyptian.

The first formation was based on the shtat (table of organization and equipment) of September 13, 1939 and under this organization it took part in the Winter War against Finland, arriving at the front north of Leningrad in December and performing so capably in the battles in early 1940 that it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Following this it was converted to serve for two years as a mountain rifle division in the Caucasus region. Following Operation Barbarossa and the German invasion of the Crimea elements of the division were committed to amphibious landings behind enemy lines in early 1942 but these proved abortive. Soon after the 138th was converted back to a standard rifle division. Arriving on the southern approaches to Stalingrad in late July the division fought on the approaches to the city through August and into September before it was assigned to 62nd Army and shipped into the factory district in mid-October. Well into November it played a leading role in defending the Barricades (Barrikady) ordnance factory, eventually becoming isolated in a thin strip of land between the factory and the Volga which became known as \\"Lyudnikov's Island\\" after its commanding officer. Following the Soviet counteroffensive that encircled the German 6th Army and other Axis forces in and near Stalingrad the division restored contact with the rest of its Army and then helped eliminate its trapped foes, for which it was raised to Guards status as the 70th Guards Rifle Division. A new 138th was raised in May, 1943 under the \\"shtat\\" of December 10, 1942, based on two rifle brigades, one of which was naval infantry from the Leningrad area and one of which was from central Asia. It first saw action in the advance through eastern Ukraine following the Battle of Kursk, and took part in the battle for the Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket. Later in 1944 it drove into the western Ukraine, eventually into the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, and from the autumn of that year until the spring of 1945 advanced through the difficult terrain of Slovakia, winning its own Order of the Red Banner in the process and ending the war in eastern Moravia. This formation of the division was disbanded shortly after the fighting ended.  1st Formation  The division was originally based on a regimental cadre (301st Rifle Regiment) from the 48th Rifle Division and began forming in September, 1939, with the following order of battle: * 554th Rifle Regiment * 650th Rifle Regiment * 768th Rifle Regiment * 295th Light Artillery Regiment * 198th Antitank Battalion * 203rd Signal Battalion * 155th Reconnaissance Battalion * 179th Sapper Battalion * 436th Tank Battalion * 135th Medical/Sanitation Battalion The division was under the command of Kombrig Aleksandr Ivanovich Pastrevich, but he was replaced in December by Kombrig Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Khadeev. By December the 138th was already engaged in the Soviet-Finnish Winter War. Fighting as a separate rifle division, part of 7th Army on the Karelian Isthmus, the 138th took part in the renewed offensive that began with concentrated artillery bombardments on February 1, 1940. Concentrated on a 16km front that stretched from Summa to the L√§hde road to the Munasuo Swamp, nine rifle divisions backed by five tank brigades attacked on February 11 and by the 15th the Finnish forces were withdrawn to the intermediate line. This line was reached by advance forces of 7th Army late on the 16th but was not strong enough to delay the Soviet advance for more than a few days.William R. Trotter, A Frozen Hell, Workman Publishing, New York, NY, 1991, pp. 206-07, 242-43 When the fighting was over, the division had collectively won the Order of the Red Banner, and three officers were awarded the Gold Star of Heroes of the Soviet Union. =Conversion to Mountain Division= Between March 14 and April 15, 1941, the division was converted to a mountain rifle division with a specialized order of battle featuring four rifle regiments made up of oversized companies (no battalion structure), with supporting arms, capable of independent operations in difficult terrain and backed by light and mobile mountain artillery:Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", Soviet Mountain, Naval, NKVD, and Allied Divisions and Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VII, 1995, pp. 3-4 * 344th Mountain Rifle Regiment (newly formed) * 554th Mountain Rifle Regiment (from 554th Rifle Regiment, until March 1, 1942) * 650th Mountain Rifle Regiment (from 650th Rifle Regiment) * 768th Mountain Rifle Regiment (from 768th Rifle Regiment) * 295th Artillery Regiment (from 295th Light Artillery Regiment) * 536th Howitzer Regiment (added to division following the Winter War) * 284th Antitank Battery * 76th Antiaircraft Battery (later 326th Antiaircraft Battalion) * 292nd Mortar Battalion * 155th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (from 155th Reconnaissance Battalion) * 179th Sapper Battalion (as previous) * 203rd Signal Battalion (as previous) * 41st Machine Gun Battalion (later 82nd Machine Gun Battalion) * 135th Medical/Sanitation Battalion (as previous) * 214th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company * 408th Motor Transport Company (newly formed)Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", pp. 14-15 * 115th Field Bakery * 269th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 223rd Remount Detachment * 464th Field Postal Station * 51st Field Office of the State Bank Kombrig Yakov Andreevich Ishchenko had been in command of the division through most of 1940 and had his rank modernized to major general on June 4. At the outbreak of war with Germany on June 22, 1941, the 138th was near Leninakan in the 23rd Rifle Corps of Transcaucasian Military District, and became part of 45th Army in July.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1941, pp. 12, 20, 27, 36 General Ishchenko gave up his command on September 22 and was replaced three days later by Col. Pavel Maksimovich Yagunov; Ishchenko would remain in staff positions for the duration of the war. =Crimean Operations= In October the division was shifted to 46th Army, and added the 82nd Machine-gun Battalion to its order of battle on the 10th. On December 25 it went into the 'active army' in the 47th Army of Crimean Front.Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", p. 15 Overnight on December 28/29 elements of the 44th Army staged a successful amphibious landing at the German-held port of Feodosiya on the Kerch peninsula. While the operation soon secured the port, by January 1, 1942 the Soviet lodgement of three rifle divisions with about 23,000 men had been contained by the German XXXXII Army Corps about 18km to the west. Meanwhile the commander of German 11th Army, Gen. of Inf. E. von Manstein, made preparations to eliminate the Soviet bridgehead.Robert Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2014, pp. 106-07, 110, 114-15 Meanwhile the commander of Crimean Front, Lt. Gen. D. T. Koslov, was making preparations to divert Manstein's reserves. A further landing by 218 men of the 226th Mountain Rifle Regiment (63rd Mountain Rifle Division) was made on the night of January 5/6 near Sudak, about 40km southwest of Feodosiya. As a diversion this was unsuccessful as Manstein's counterattack on Feodosiya began at dawn on January 15 but in the face of this Kozlov chose to send the rest of the 226th Regiment to Sudak. By January 20 the Soviet forces at Feodosiya had been forced back to the Parpach Narrows and both sides dug in while German and Romanian troops were dispatched to deal with the situation at Sudak. In \\"an arrant display of stupidity\\" Koslov decided to reinforce failure and on the night of January 24/25 Maj. S. I. Zabrodotsky's 554th Mountain Rifle Regiment was landed there, followed by an additional 1,300 troops the next night. Despite this the commander of XXX Army Corps reported on January 28 that the Sudak bridgehead had been eliminated. About 2,000 Red Army troops were killed, nearly half of whom had been taken prisoner before being executed, a few hundred were evacuated by sea and most of the remainder disappeared into the mountains, with perhaps 350-500 joining partisan groups.Forczyk, Where the Iron Crosses Grow, pp. 114-19. Sharp states the 650th Regiment made the landing. This appears to be an error as the 554th was disbanded at the beginning of March. Sharp gives the date of the landing as January 15. The balance of the division fought under 51st Army in February and March, suffering heavy losses until being pulled back into reserve near Kerch. On March 24 Colonel Yagunov was replaced in command by Col. Mikhail Yakovlevich Pimenov. The division began reforming on March 30, and on April 8 it was once again officially the 138th Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Death\\", pp. 14-15 Its remaining mountain rifle regiments became standard rifle regiments and the 292nd Mortar Battalion was added.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p. 52 One month later, German 11th Army began Operation Trappenjagd into the eastern end of the peninsula. The 138th escaped relatively intact from the Kerch Naval Base, evacuating to Krasnodar on the night of May 19/20.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 52  Battle of Stalingrad  On May 16 the division came under the command of Col. Ivan Ilich Lyudnikov, who had been in command of the 200th Rifle Division at the time of the German invasion. After recovering from severe wounds he had led several divisions in the Caucasus region, including the 63rd Mountain. In late June the German forces launched Operation Blue, aiming for, among other objectives, the city of Stalingrad. As forces of Southern Front moved north to Stalingrad Front's positions along the middle Don River in mid-July the STAVKA ordered North Caucasus Front to reinforce its positions east of Rostov-na-Donu with the 138th and the 115th Cavalry Division from 51st Army. On July 31 the 4th Panzer Army began an advance on the Abganerovo axis. This struck the 138th and 157th Rifle Divisions, tearing apart their defenses east of the Don and forcing them to withdraw in considerable disorder toward Kotelnikovo.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 189, 276-77 =Fighting on the Approaches= Late on August 2 the commander of 64th Army, Maj. Gen. M. S. Shumilov, created the Southern Operational Group under command of his deputy, Lt. Gen. V. I. Chuikov. The next day Shumilov ordered the 138th and 157th to reinforce this Group, which was to defend the line of the Aksai River. By nightfall on August 4 Chuikov's Group had proven incapable of maintaining a coherent defense over a front of 60km with divisions that had from 1,500 - 4,500 men each (the 138th had 4,200 on strength), with a total of about 40 tanks and 300 guns and mortars in support. Unless something was done, German forces could advance on Stalingrad virtually unimpeded. In response, in order to improve command and control, the STAVKA split Stalingrad Front and created Southeastern Front effective August 7 and 51st Army, with the 138th, was subordinated to the latter, although the division remained part of Group Chuikov. It was currently holding its defense along the Aksai, at Gorodskii and Novoaksaysky.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 279-85, 554 As these command rearrangements were being made the 14th Panzer Division resumed its advance on August 5 and during the day thrust 30-40km north from Aksai, bypassing Group Chuikov's weak left flank and reaching Abganerovo Station, 70km southwest of Stalingrad. Despite this perilous position Chuikov's Group managed to halt the left wing of 4th Panzer Army along the lower Aksai for 12 days. This forced the Panzer Army to divide its forces instead of concentrating for a decisive advance on the city. On August 5 the Romanian VI Army Corps managed to force a bridgehead at the junction between the 138th and 157th divisions but this was thrown back with a dawn counterattack the next day. On August 13 General Shumilov, concerned that Group Chuikov could be encircled, ordered a phased withdrawal to the Myshkova River. By this time the division had been formally subordinated to 64th Army as the 51st fell back east toward the Volga.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 285-86, 306 4th Panzer Army resumed its advance on August 20 with its XXXXVIII Panzer Corps, which fielded 180-200 tanks. 64th Army was deployed across a front of 120km, with the sector of the lower Myshkova defended by three rifle divisions backed by the 138th and 29th Rifle Divisions and 154th Naval Rifle Brigade in second echelon with the 13th Tank Corps concentrated southeast of Tinguta Station. The assault soon drove back the first echelon and a battlegroup of 14th Panzer, reinforced by part of 29th Motorized Division, advanced 4km and captured Tinguta. In response Shumilov withdrew the 138th and the 154th Brigade to reserve positions 5km to the rear. On August 22 the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps redeployed and in heavy fighting reached the southern and eastern approaches to the Station, forcing the 138th and 204th Divisions into all-around defenses to protect it. The German assault was renewed over the next two days but at the end of August 24 the 64th Army reported: While this attack was fought to a standstill, on August 29 the XXXXVIII Panzer Corps found a weak spot and overwhelmed the 126th Rifle Division north of Abganerovo Station, advancing 20km during the day, forcing the 138th to abandon its positions at Tinguta.Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 364-66, 368-69, 371 The divisional command post of the 126th had been overrun, many staff officers killed, and the divisional commander captured; by the end of the day the division had been reduced to only 1,054 combat troops.Dann Falk, The 64th Army at Stalingrad 1942-43, Falken Books, 2019, Kindle ed., ch. 9 The collapse of the 126th also unhinged the defenses of the 29th and 138th divisions along the rail line, forcing them to withdraw northward and opening a path to the rear areas of 64th and 62nd Armies. The commander of Southeastern Front, Col. Gen. A. I. Yeryomenko, ordered Shumilov to withdraw to new defenses from Novy Rogachik southeastward along the Chervlennaia River to Ivanovka, 25km southwest of Stalingrad. Overnight on August 30/31 the 138th was withdrawn to the Army's reserve and was noted the next day as having no more than 1,000 \\"bayonets\\" (infantry and sappers) on strength. By the end of September 2 it was situated in the second echelon defenses along the Peschanka Balka (ravine).Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 374, 377-78 4th Panzer Army renewed its offensive on September 8. The 29th Motorized and a battlegroup of 14th Panzer wheeled south and struck the extreme right wing of 64th Army southeast of Voroponovo Station. The assault pressed the 204th and 126th Divisions and the reinforcing 138th Division and 133rd Tank Brigade back to new defenses extending southwest from Peschanka. The Army reported, \\"As a result of the enemy tank attack, [138th Rifle Division's] 343rd Rifle Regiment was almost completely destroyed,\\" although \\"18 enemy tanks were destroyed and burned.\\" The following day the German forces drove southward west of Kuporosnoe, forcing the 138th, 204th and 157th Divisions to abandon Staro-Dubovka. The Soviet forces withdrew to the new defense line east and west of Gornaia Poliana, which was already manned by the 126th Division. During the day the remainder of 14th Panzer reinforced the assault of the 29th Motorized and while this was halted short of Kuporosnoe and the west bank of the Volga, the four rifle divisions were being rapidly eroded away.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 79-81Glantz identifies the 343rd as a regiment of the 138th. The 343rd was a regiment of the 38th Rifle Division which was also part of 64th Army at the time. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 15 Overnight on September 9/10 a battalion of the 29th Motorized reached the Volga south of Kuporosnoe but was thrown back in part by the 131st Rifle Division after it had been relieved at Gornaia Poliana. The 138th and 126th Divisions were now supported by the fresh 56th Tank Brigade and a regiment from the Krasnodar Infantry School, containing the 14th Panzer. On September 12 the fighting for the Stalingrad suburbs reached its climax. 14th Panzer was now supported by the mixed German/Romanian IV Army Corps and probed the defenses of the 64th Army from the southwest outskirts of Kuporosnoe around to its boundary with 57th Army at Ivanovka. This position would become known as the Beketovka bridgehead. At this time the division was noted as having a total of 2,123 personnel. Lyudnikov's chief of staff was Lt. Col. V. I. Shuba and his political officer was N. I. Titov.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 89-91, 93, 104, 109, 266 =Beketovka Bridgehead= In the last days of September a task group of 57th Army carried out a successful counterstroke against the positions of 1st Romanian Infantry Division at Lake Tsatsa and the 14th Panzer had to be sent to stabilize the front. This was followed overnight on October 1/2 by an attack by five divisions, including the 138th, of the 64th Army against the positions of the 371st Infantry Division at and west of Peschanka in an attempt to capture that place and Staro-Dubovka. The commander of the 422nd Rifle Division, Col. I. K. Morozov, wrote:Although the attack failed, it was an unpleasant distraction for Gen. F. Paulus whose 6th Army was now deeply involved in the fighting in the city. On October 5 the 138th arrived in the reserve of Stalingrad Front for refitting. Over the next 8-10 days its manpower was raised to 2,646 although it was short of rifles and machine guns (on hand 1,025 rifles, 224 submachine guns, 6 light and 12 heavy machine guns, 27 antitank rifles) and numbers of these had to be taken from the other regiments to fully arm the 650th. However it was strong in artillery with 11 122mm howitzers, 31 76mm cannons and 21 antitank guns.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 344-46, 400, 783. Glantz mistakenly gives Morozov's rank as major general in this text. =Into the City= By late on October 14 the Dzerzhinskiy Tractor Factory had fallen to forces of German 6th Army and Chuikov, now in command of 62nd Army, recognized that the city's defense now had to be anchored on the Barrikady munitions factory and the Krasny Oktyabr steel plant. Yeryomenko promised to release the 138th, which was partially rested and replenished, the next day.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, p. 392 On the night of October 15/16 the 138th began crossing the Volga into Stalingrad, coming under Chuikov's orders again as part of 62nd Army,Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", pp. 52-53 to take up positions at the Barrikady: The crossing, under heavy German fire, was carried out by the 44th Brigade of the Volga Flotilla. The leading 650th Regiment was dispatched to reinforce the sagging defenses of the 95th Rifle Division's 161st and 241st Rifle Regiments east of the Stadium, moving into well-prepared positions supported by roughly 20 tanks of the 84th Tank Brigade.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 400, 402-03 The German Group J√§necke, consisting of the 305th Infantry and 14th Panzer Divisions, supported by elements of 24th Panzer, had begun a new assault on the Soviet positions north and west of the Barrikady on October 16. Up to 40 German tanks attacked Soviet positions along Leninskii Prospekt and Tramvainaia Street at 1300 hours and pushed into the northern part of the Barrikady by the end of the day. The 650th was thrown in immediately to hold a new line south of Tramvainaia to the northern end of Volkhovstroevsk Street. The 344th and 768th Regiments began their crossings at 0500 hours on October 17 and on arrival fanned out to protect the remainder of the factory and the strip of land between it and the Volga. The former took up positions in the central manufacturing halls and the latter deployed along Leninskii Prospekt northeast of the factory, tying in with the 95th Division. With suitable positions at a premium Colonel Lyudnikov had to squeeze his command post into damaged bunkers already occupied by 62nd Army headquarters personnel.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 401-03, 406-07 Overnight Group J√§necke regrouped with the intention of expelling the 138th from the Barrikady and then encircling the entire 308th Rifle Division and the 685th Regiment of the 193rd Rifle Division in the workers' settlement west of it. This plan was compromised by serious weaknesses in the attacking forces, especially in tanks and assault guns. On the morning of October 17 the tanks and infantry of 14th Panzer made rapid progress after smashing through the boundary between the 650th and 768th Regiments, forcing both to retreat deeper into the northern and western parts of the Barrikady. By noon the 344th was caught up in the melee and as the day ended all three regiments had fallen back to new defenses, exposing the right wing of the 308th. In consequence this division suffered heavy casualties and its survivors fell back to the 138th's positions. While the division had prevented the German forces from taking the factory in one bound, the first full day of its defense had been a defeat and Chuikov was forced to shift his headquarters south to the Krasny Oktyabr. However 14th Panzer had lost 19 of its original 33 tanks destroyed or knocked out during the day.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 412-13, 416, 419 During the night the German LI Army Corps regrouped again to complete the capture of the Barrikady, including its remaining halls and the Bread Factory one block south. The assault group of the previous day was reinforced with 18 StuG III assault guns of the 244th and 245th Battalions. Supporting forces of the 24th Panzer, 389th Infantry and 100th J√§ger Divisions would also be involved, leading to an overly complex plan for the day's attack. This quickly degenerated into a costly slugfest that continued over several days with only limited German gains. Lyudnikov ordered his 344th Regiment to contest every one of the factory's ruined halls and other buildings. The 305th Infantry and the grenadiers of 14th Panzer were forced into the tedious and costly process of rooting out Soviet infantrymen and sappers from every room and shop and as they slowly approached the Volga became more exposed to artillery fire from the east bank. During the day the 24th Panzer and a regiment of the 389th Infantry finally secured the Brick Factory north of the Barrikady from the remnants of 37th Guards Rifle Division supported by the 650th Regiment, while a separate push against the 650th to reach the Volga did so only along a very narrow sector and at heavy cost.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 421-23 A relative lull in operations followed from October 19-22 due in part to diminishing German strength and in part to intermittent heavy rains and occasional snow showers which did not clear until early on the 21st. During this time the 138th organized and strengthened its defenses and launched strong local counterattacks while Paulus called up the 79th Infantry Division. An attack planned by LI Corps for the morning of October 19 against all three regiments of the division came to an abrupt and bloody halt; the German regiments could each muster no more than a battalion with about 10 tanks or assault guns in support. The battlegroups of the 305th Infantry's 576th and 578th Regiments attacked the 768th Regiment at dawn, splashing through flooded shell craters, climbing over heaps of debris and gaining some ground but also coming under flanking small arms fire from the 2nd Battalion of the 344th to the south as well as direct and indirect fire from the 295th Artillery Regiment. Without air support, due to the weather, the commander of the 576th Regiment reported that \\"the cleansing of Hall 6 (the Manufacturing Hall) and Hall 4 (the Assembly Hall) was going to be a bloody an protracted affair.\\" After this effort was suspended Lyudnikov ordered the 344th, supported by survivors of the 308th Division, to counterattack into the southwest corner of the factory to reach the boundary with the 193rd Division. This took the German forces by surprise and regained some ground.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 428-34 The LI Corps planned for a renewed offensive on the two factories to begin on October 23. For the Barrikady the 14th Panzer and 79th Infantry were to attack from its southwest corner southward to Karuselnaya Street to capture the Bread Factory and the Krasny Oktyabr. Meanwhile the 305th Infantry and a squadron of six tanks of 24th Panzer were to conduct a secondary attack to clear the Barrikady and west bank of the Volga to its north and northeast. By this time all nine battalions of the 305th were combat rated as \\"weak\\" and the 24th Panzer had only 15 operational tanks. At the same time the 84th Brigade had only a \\"handful\\" of tanks remaining; the 138th, with the remnants of the 308th and the 37th Guards, counted fewer than 2,500 men.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 460, 467-68, 474 Assault groups of the 305th Infantry launched a series of night attacks at 0100 hours on October 23 against the positions of the 650th Rifle Regiment among the gullies and ravines northeast of the factory. These night attacks from German forces were unexpected, but also unsuccessful. The main attack began at 0810, preceded by air and artillery bombardments. The assault of the 578th Regiment, with the six tanks of the 24th Panzer, struck the railroad yards and severely damaged halls in the southern half of the Barrikady that were defended by two weak battalions of the 308th, later reinforced by a battalion of the 650th. The other battlegroups of the 305th, attacking the northern part of the factory, advanced only about 100 metres in the face of resistance from the 344th and 768th Regiments. Hall 4 was retaken by a counterattack and the commander of the 305th advised Paulus during a visit to the front lines that his division was no longer capable of offensive operations. During the day's fighting the 138th received 258 replacements.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 477, 484-85, 795 The next day the two sides, both reduced to little more than weak battalion and company groups, continued a desperate struggle among the ruined shops, halls and warehouses, with gains and losses measured in tens of metres. Initial German attacks seized part of Hall 6b but faltered as the 768th Regiment was reinforced by elements of the other two regiments. However, a renewed effort at 1630 hours captured Hall 4 and most of Hall 6. On the morning of October 25 nearly all of the southern and central factory buildings were in German hands; at this point the 768th was deployed in the north and the 650th in the south of the division's sector with the 344th in between, still holding a corner of Hall 6. Given the march-companies and replacements Yeryomenko continued to ferry across the river the division likely still had about 2,500 men on strength, whereas the 305th Infantry had been weakened to less than 1,200 infantry. Its further attacks during the day made minor gains leaving the 138th holding just the northeastern part of the factory grounds. Chuikov recorded that the \\"backbone\\" of his 308th, 193rd, 138th and 37th Guards Divisions had \\"lost... combat effectiveness\\" and \\"only soldiers who arrived as recent reinforcements remain in the divisions.\\"Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 489, 492-96, 500, 502 During October 26 and 27 the fighting in the factory district focused on the ferry landing stage between the Barrikady and the Krasny Oktyabr where the reinforcing 45th Rifle Division was scheduled to arrive. On the second day the left flank of the 650th Regiment and a regiment of the 308th Division were overrun by German sub-machine gunners which occupied Mezenskaya and Tuvinskaya Streets, reaching within 400m of the Volga although later thrown back somewhat. At about the same time, in a move that would soon prove crucial to the 138th, units of the 14th Panzer and 305th Infantry reached the Barrikady's fuel storage tank farm. The fighting in this area continued during the next two days without further German gains, but during this period the remainder of the 305th finally cleared the factory's eastern edge and the 138th fell back into the maze of buildings and streets between the factory and the Volga.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 507-10, 514-16 =Lyudnikov's Island= The arrival of the 6,500 men of the 45th Division tipped the battle for the factory district in 62nd Army's favor and fighting died down over the last days of the month. Between November 1-10 there was another operational lull but fierce fighting continued on a limited scale, including more unsuccessful German efforts to take the ferry stage with armor support. New attacks on November 2-3 by the 305th Infantry, now reinforced with more assault guns and panzerj√§gers, faltered immediately against the 650th and 768th Regiments. Fighting largely ceased on November 4 as both sides prepared for an expected final effort by 6th Army to clear the city before winter set in. Raids and small actions by both sides continued until November 10. The front-line positions of the 138th (and attached 118th Guards Rifle Regiment) were as follows:When the 305th and 389th Infantry Divisions completed their preparations on that date they had been reinforced with five combat engineer battalions from outside the city, each numbering about 450 men which, combined with their own remaining infantry and engineers, gave the divisions a total of about 5,200 men, outnumbering the Soviet troops they faced by more than two to one.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 519, 620-25, 630, 634-36 Attack on the \\"Pharmacy\\" and the \\"Commissar's House\\"This final bid began with an artillery preparation at 0340 hours on November 11 against the 138th and 95th Divisions east of the Barrikady. Early on the attackers penetrated the 241st Regiment of the 95th and reached the Volga on a 200m front east of Mezenskaya. At the same time the 138th was struck by three infantry regiments, two engineer battalions plus 16 assault guns, weighted to its right (north) flank northeast of the factory, but managed to initially hold its positions. The 578th Infantry Regiment, led by the 50th Engineer Battalion and ten assault guns, plowed slowly toward two key objectives designated as the \\"Pharmacy\\" and the \\"Commissar's House\\", both about 400m from the river; the latter contained Lyudnikov's headquarters. Finding a gap between the 241st and 650th Regiments a German assault group seized the ruins around the Pharmacy, but when the 50th Engineers approached the Commissar's House they found all its entrances blocked with rubble. Unable to deploy satchel charges against it they fell back to nearby shell holes where they were pinned down by heavy fire.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 644-48 Meanwhile the 576th Infantry Regiment and 294th Engineer Battalion were making continuous progress against the 241st Regiment and ultimately captured the fuel tank farm. This effectively cut the 138th off from the remainder of 62nd Army. Further attempts to advance from the ravine east of the Pharmacy towards House No. 79 were stymied by flanking fire from the Commissar's House. The 344th Regiment stopped the 577th Regiment immediately east of the factory but a regiment of the 389th Infantry Division, led by two engineer battalions and a mix of assault guns and panzerj√§gers, threw the 768th Regiment out of its last toehold in the factory and back to within 200m of the river. The last seven men of the 118th Guards Regiment were forced to fight their way south to Lyudnikov's now-isolated bridgehead by the day's end. German infantry casualties had been moderate but armor losses had been high. Lyudnikov reported that his 768th was down to 24 men and condemned the withdrawal of the 241st Regiment \\"without advance warning\\" that left his division pocketed, a pocket that LI Corps was confident could be eliminated the next day.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 648-52 In the event Paulus ordered a halt for November 12. The two German divisions dug in and reorganized as Chuikov demanded attacks to restore contact with the 138th. As part of this effort the composite regiment (685th, about 200 men) of the 193rd Division was subordinated to Lyudnikov at 1800 hours. During November 12-22 the attacks of the 193rd plus elements of the 95th Division retook part of the fuel tank farm but failed to reestablish contact with the division. At 0345 hours on November 13 the LI Corps renewed its assaults on the 138th. Lyudnikov ordered his roughly 2,000 men:The early attack caught the 650th Regiment off guard and reached the walls of the Commissar's House (the \\"–ü-shaped building\\" in Soviet accounts). The 50th Engineers, now equipped with ladders, were able to enter through upper-floor windows and drove the defenders into fortified cellars where they were attacked with smoke grenades, satchel charges and gasoline. These defenders were mostly mortar-men of the 650th and repeatedly called in artillery fire on their positions during the late afternoon; only ten of these, most of whom were wounded or burned, were able to escape. The 578th Infantry gained another block north of the Commissar's House, considerably reducing the bridgehead which now measured about 700m in width and 400m in depth. Lyudnikov had by now moved his headquarters to a ravine on the Volga bank just east of the building that the German forces called the Red House.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 657-59, 662-67, 670 Modern-day ruins of the \\"Red House\\"With no strength left to conduct major attacks elsewhere in the factory district, on November 14 the LI Corps again sought to liquidate \\"Lyudnikov's Island\\". The right flank of the 344th Regiment was struck by the 577th Infantry, spearheaded by two companies of the 336th Engineers and supported by as many as 23 assault guns. House No. 74, defended by the 650th Regiment, was also targeted; in all slightly more than 3,000 German troops attacked less than half this number manning hundreds of strongpoints scattered through the rubble. Despite hard fighting and heavy losses German gains were limited and two buildings lost by the 344th Regiment were later regained in counterattacks. The division's supply situation was becoming critical; captured weapons and ammunition were in extensive use and drops from Po-2 aircraft frequently fell into German hands. By day's end the 138th had roughly 500 \\"bayonets\\" still in the fight. After yet another regrouping the German attack continued the next day against its right and left flanks, focused on individual buildings, and meeting repeated counterattacks. At nightfall Lyudnikov's staff reported that the 768th was no longer combat- effective, the 650th numbered 31 men, and the 344th had 123, including its command cadre. Overall the division had 20-30 rounds per rifle, no grenades or sub-machine gun ammo, no food, and about 250 wounded were at the division's command post. Overnight four bales of provisions and four of ammunition were airdropped, but again some of these fell within German lines.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 671-75, 677-79 From November 16-18 Paulus ordered another pause in the battle, in preparation for a new attack on November 20. During this period the 578th Infantry and its attached and much weakened engineers advanced less than a block on the left flank of the 650th Regiment along the Volga. Meanwhile the river was rapidly icing-up, blocking supply traffic to 62nd Army from the east bank. On November 17 Hitler sent a new order to 6th Army stating that the ice presented an opportunity to reach the river, specifically in the Barrikady and Krasny Oktyabr sectors. The next day a carefully planned attack beginning at 0400 hours captured House No. 77 from the 650th Regiment and a further effort in the afternoon gained about 100m along the riverbank. The division was still very short of supplies and with no means to recharge radio batteries could no longer call in artillery support. But this marked the last gasp for the LI Corps' offensive. As of November 20 the 138th had a personnel strength of 1,673 remaining, although most of these were in the artillery and support services on the east bank.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, pp. 679-81, 688-91, 701 =Siege of 6th Army= Further air drops on November 19 had delivered 10,000 rounds of rifle cartridges and several boxes of food to the \\"Island\\" where it remaining 250 active \\"bayonets\\" fended off several attacks without losing ground. On the same day Operation Uranus began as Southwestern and Don Fronts attacked German and Romanian positions northwest of Stalingrad. The Axis crisis deepened the next day when Stalingrad Front went over to the offensive southwest of the city. 62nd Army's role was to continue to defend and to launch local attacks to tie down German forces. The 138th was struck again on November 21, repelled four battalion-sized attacks supported by seven assault guns and had about 180 of its men wounded through the day but also received supplies from several ships which also evacuated most of the casualties. The attacks persisted the next day with similar results and replacements kept the division at a strength of about 300 infantry. Maj. Gen. F. E. Bokov of the Red Army General Staff complained that Chuikov was failing to support the division and demanded that more ice cutters and icebreakers be brought in to ensure supplies. The encirclement of the Axis forces was completed the same day.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 248-49, 293-94, 333-34 Following the encirclement the Soviet armies encountered tough resistance from the German forces within what was rapidly becoming a fortress. 62nd Army's skeletal divisions attacked on November 28-29 but made minimal gains before going over to the defense the next day. The 95th Division continued to try to break through from the south to the 138th, without success.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, pp. 506-08 The 305th Infantry was in little better shape, reporting on December 2 that it had about 1,000 men in its front lines mostly facing roughly 600 of the 138th.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 167-68 Apart from minor positional sparring the fighting in the city was minimal until December 16 when the Volga finally froze solid, which soon allowed vehicular supply traffic to 62nd Army. Contact with \\"Lyudnikov's Island\\" was firmly reestablished on the 23rd.Geoffrey Jukes, Stalingrad; The Turning Point, Ballantine Books Inc., New York, 1968, p. 142 The 138th had attacked at 0500 hours on the 21st, capturing four houses, five machine guns and two prisoners while advancing 100m-120m to the south while the 95th Division drove northwest making similar gains. Fighting continued on December 22 and the two divisions linked up on a 50m-wide sector along the river which was widened the next day.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 348-49 The two sides faced each other within the city for the next several weeks as the German relief attempt, Operation Winter Storm, played out. 62nd Army was now under command of Don Front and prepared for Operation Ring, the final offensive against 6th Army; at this time the 138th had 800-900 active \\"bayonets\\" in the city which was above average. At 0200 hours on January 10, 1943 Chuikov ordered his 156th Fortified Region to relieve the division in the \\"Island\\" with its 400th Machine GunArtillery Battalion. This move permitted the division to shift south into a sector just east of the Krasny Oktyabr between the 39th Guards and 45th Rifle Divisions in preparation for an assault west toward Znamenskaya Street. This attack by the three divisions on January 12 did not achieve any decisive results but LI Corps reported 23 killed and 85 wounded during the day although this did not include any tally from the 305th Infantry. Progress increased on January 14 when the combined Soviet force gained up to ten blocks deep into the lower Krasny Oktyabr village, pressing toward Hill 107.5 which dominated the area. By the 20th the 138th and the 39th Guards, now joined by the 13th Guards Rifle Division, were close enough to the Hill to send reconnaissance teams toward its eastern slopes.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 418, 444-46, 459, 466, 481, 506 At 0100 hours on January 22 Chuikov issued his Order No. 24 directing his divisions to finally seize the objectives he had assigned a week earlier but they were now facing increasing numbers of German refugees from the fighting outside the city and made little progress. On January 27 Colonel Lyudnikov was promoted to the rank of major general. Two days later the 138th, 45th and 95th Divisions were ordered to finish the fighting for the Barrikady and the Bread Factory as well as a portion of the Barrikady village but were unable to prise the remnants of the half-starved German troops from their bastions there as the rest of the Front's armies closed in from the west.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, pp. 516, 552 The last men of LI Corps, two days later than the rest of 6th Army, laid down their arms on February 2 and four days later, while being moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, the 138th Rifle Division became the 70th Guards Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 53  2nd Formation  A new 138th Rifle Division began forming at Kalinin in the Moscow Military District in May, 1943 from the 6th Naval Infantry Brigade and the 109th Rifle Brigade,Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 132 under 52nd Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 53 At this point in the war, the Red Army was generally amalgamating separate rifle brigades into rifle divisions, which were more efficient on the battlefield. =6th Naval Infantry Brigade= The first brigade with this designation was formed at Novorossiysk in August, 1941 but was soon disbanded. A second brigade completed forming on September 15 at Kronstadt by the Red Banner Baltic Fleet with five battalions and went to the front with 4,980 officers and men under command including 2,368 Communist Party or Komsomol members. It was immediately moved to the lines south of Leningrad, joining the 42nd Army. Until April, 1942 the brigade shifted among the armies defending Leningrad and then was moved across Lake Ladoga to join the 54th Army of Volkhov Front, remaining there for the next year defending in the swampy forests north of Novgorod, some of the worst terrain on the front. In the spring of 1943 it was organized as follows: * 1st, 2nd, 3rd Infantry Battalions * Mortar Battalion (50mm and 82mm mortars) * Artillery Battalion (76.2mm cannon) * Antitank Battery * Reconnaissance Company * Medical/Sanitation Company * Motor Transport CompanySharp, \\"Red Death\\", pp. 33-34 =109th Rifle Brigade= The first brigade of this designation was formed from December 1941 to April 1942 in the Moscow Military District and finally arrived at the front in June as part of 13th Army in Bryansk Front. It remained under these commands until November when it was broken up to provide replacements for other units. A second 109th started forming almost immediately in the Central Asia Military District and remained there until May 1943 when it was railed west to join the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and was soon disbanded to provide much of the manpower and equipment for the new 138th Rifle Division.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, 1996, pp. 51-52 Col. Moisei Yakovlevich Katkov was assigned as commander on May 20 but was replaced on June 19 by Col. Ivan Stepanovich Prutkov. Once formed the division had the following order of battle: * 344th Rifle Regiment * 650th Rifle Regiment * 768th Rifle Regiment * 295th (briefly 296th) Artillery Regiment * 284th Antitank Battalion * 230th Reconnaissance Company * 179th Sapper Battalion * 203rd Signal Battalion (later 117th Signal Company) * 135th Medical/Sanitation Battalion * 214th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company * 408th Motor Transport Company * 425th Field Bakery * 269th Divisional Veterinary Hospital * 1102nd Field Postal Station * 1273rd (later 1785th) Field Office of the State Bank The division remained in Reserve until August when 52nd Army was assigned to Voronezh Front during the Belgorod-Kharkov Offensive Operation; at this time it was assigned to the 78th Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 148, 176, 206, 222 On September 9 Col. Viktor Ivanovich Rutko took over command from Colonel Prutkov. As 52nd Army approached the Dniepr on September 20 the division was recorded as having 4,514 personnel on strength, supported by 73 82mm and 18 120mm mortars, 46 regimental guns, 20 76.2mm divisional cannon and 12 122mm howitzers. By the end of the month 52nd Army had reached the Dniepr, and its 254th Rifle Division soon forced a crossing in the Kreshchatik area. During October the Army was moved to Steppe Front, which became 2nd Ukrainian Front on October 20.Soviet General Staff, The Battle of the Dnepr, ed. & trans. R. W. Harrison, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2018, pp. 179-80, 291 Before the end of the month the division was moved to Front reserves, then in November to 4th Guards Army in the same Front, where it joined the 5th Guards Airborne Division in 20th Guards Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 280, 308 During December it was again reassigned, now to 21st Guards Rifle Corps, which also contained the 69th Guards Rifle Division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 17 While 4th Guards Army was largely on the defense during this period, joint advances by 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts in the Dniepr bend during November and December had allowed the Army to substantially expand its bridgehead between Kremenchug and Cherkassy. As early as November 20 the 1st Panzer Army reported that its infantry strength had fallen to the lowest tolerable level and Cherkassy was threatened with encirclement. The fighting through the first three weeks of December was largely attritional in nature but around the middle of the month the German line north of Krivoi Rog gave way and soon 2nd Ukrainian Front had cleared the west bank of the Dniepr north to Cherkassy.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, pp. 188-89 =Korsun‚ÄìCherkassy Pocket= The Kirovograd Offensive began on January 5 and involved four armies, although the 4th Guards was in a secondary role, and the city was liberated three days later. The advance to the northwest continued until January 16 by which time the German XI and XXXXII Army Corps, holding the last sector of the Dniepr line, were deeply enveloped. On January 25 the 4th Guards Army, which was still rebuilding in strength, plunged into the front of the German 8th Army southwest of Cherkassy and was helping set the stage for a classic double envelopment in conjunction with two mobile corps of 6th Tank Army attacking from the north. On the afternoon of January 28 the encirclement was closed in conjunction with forces of 1st Ukrainian Front, 56,000 German troops were trapped, and the 138th helped form the inner ring of the encircling forces. The fighting for the Korsun Pocket continued until February 17 by which time about 30,000 German troops had managed to escape, roughly half of those originally encircled.Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, pp. 219, 224-29, 237 Into Western Ukraine On February 5 Colonel Rutko had left command of the division; he was replaced on February 17 by Col. Vasilii Efimovich Vasilev who would remain in this position for the duration of the war. Shortly after the Korsun battle the 138th was moved to the 53rd Army, still in 2nd Ukrainian Front, where it served briefly as a separate division.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 76 In March it was transferred to 69th Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, returning to the front a month later in the 95th Rifle Corps, 18th Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front. At around this time the 295th Artillery Regiment was completely equipped with 76mm guns (32 pieces) and no 122mm howitzers, making it, for all intents, a reinforced heavy antitank regiment. This was probably due to the nature of the fighting in Ukraine, where the Germans had most of their armored forces.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 53 Under these commands the division took part in the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive. While the Front's main drive would be in the direction of Lvov its left-flank 18th and 1st Guards Armies, located south of the Dniestr, were to advance in support in the direction of Stanislav - Drogobych. The main offensive began on July 13 and 18th Army went over to the attack on July 23; by this time the forces of Army Group North Ukraine were largely defeated and survivors were in retreat towards the Carpathian mountains. The offensive was led by three rifle divisions backed by all the Army's artillery and was directed to capture Bogorodchany by the end of July 25, subsequently towards Dolyna in order to drive the Hungarian Army into the mountains. This schedule proved over optimistic but the Army's right flank advanced as much as 20km on July 27. By the start of August the two Armies had effectively cleared the foothills of the Carpathians and set the stage for a subsequent advance into the Carpatho- Ukraine.Glantz and Harold S. Orenstein, The Battle For Lvov, July 1944, Routledge, Abingdon, UK, 2002, pp. 11, 18, 20, 74, 82-85, 155 =Into Slovakia= In August the 138th moved to 4th Ukrainian Front reserves in 17th Guards Rifle Corps. This Corps operated separately under Front command for several months in the Carpathians before being assigned to 18th Army. The division remained under these commands for the duration.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 53 During this time it earned the divisional honorific \\"Carpathian\\". Beginning on January 12, 1945 it took part in the Western Carpathian Offensive, mostly facing the German XXXXIX Mountain Corps; on January 20 the division assisted in the capture of the city of Ko≈°ice and one regiment was awarded an honorific: The division's other rifle regiments would be honored on February 19 for the same battle with the 650th receiving the Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree and the 768th being awarded the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree. On the same date the 138th as a whole was granted the Order of the Red Banner in recognition of its part in the liberation of Poprad on January 28. Over the following months the division continued its gruelling advance through Slovakia, culminating in the Moravia‚ÄìOstrava Offensive. Postwar On May 3 the division was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree, for its part in the capture of the city of Ru≈æomberok in Slovakia. By now its full formal title was 138th Rifle, Carpathian, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division.

Further awards came to several subunits of the division on May 28 when the 344th Rifle Regiment and 295th Artillery Regiment both received the Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree and the 284th Antitank Battalion was given the Order of the Red Star, all for their roles in the fighting for Ostrava and ≈Ωilina in the final offensive into western Slovakia and eastern Moravia.

She studied at Milan Polytechnic Institute and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1943. She was one of the first women to graduate from this school. During her studies, Ferrieri sought out and worked closely with Franco Albini and was influenced by the Italian Rationalist architect, admiring his neo-rationalist ideals.; whose work and theory focused around reduction, function, and rigorous beauty. She was also introduced to the Bauhaus school of thinking; simplicity and functionality.Dokulil, Heidi. ‚ÄúAnna Castelli Ferrieri and the Design Legacy of the Componibili.‚Äù more space magazine, May 7, 2017. https://morespace.spacefurniture.com/latest-news/2017/5/1/future- focused-anna-castelli-ferrieri-and-the-legacy-of-thecomponibili. Personal life Anna Castelli Ferrieri (1918-2006) was an Italian pioneering architect. Coming from a family of community members, her father, Enzo Ferrieri, was a well-known journalist, director, and critic of city's legendary Teatro del C'omegno; a highly regarded theater company.Byars, Mel. ‚ÄúAnna Castelli Ferrieri: Marrying Aesthetics and Technology.‚Äù Graphis, 1998.

Even after retirement, Ferrieri remained active in the design field. She taught at the Milan Domus Academy from 1987 ‚Äì 1992. She also took on a variety of commissions, including: ‚Äúa sofa design for Arflex, a chair for Matteo Grassi, and flatware for Sambonet‚Äù Veit, Rebecca. ‚ÄúAnna Castelli Ferrieri‚Äôs Plastic Fantastic.‚Äù Core77, November 10, 2015. https://www.core77.com//posts/42547/Anna-Castelli-Ferrieris-Plastic- Fantastic Career 1946-1947, she worked as an editor of the architecture magazine, Costruzioni, Milan.Pendergast, Sara, ed. ‚ÄúAnna Castelli Ferrieri,‚Äù Contemporary Designers, no.

In 1949, Ferrieri joined her husband, Giulio Castelli, who founded the furniture company, Kartell, which became a leading company in high quality plastic designs and plastic furniture. Plastic at this time was considered to be industry and not typically seen inside the home. According to Rossi (2009), Ferrieri experienced problems in partnership due to her trouble in balancing her role as a wife and as an architect designer.Rossi, Catharine. ‚ÄúFurniture, Feminism and the Feminine: Women Designers in Post-War Italy, 1945 to 1970.‚Äù Journal of Design History 22, no. 3 (September 2009): 243‚Äì57. https://doi.org/10.1093/jdh/epp022. She only agreed to work at Kartell, per her husband‚Äôs request, after two of his business partners left. As the internal and leading designer at Kartell, Anna Ferreri lead the way for innovative designs that led the company. In the 1960s and 1970s, furniture contributed more growth to the Kartell company over any other divisions of the company. This innovative furniture became the image of the company and the products that represented this image were the colored fitted furniture, the flower boxes, and the stools designed by Anna Castelli Ferrieri.Jerrard, Robert, and David Hands, eds. Design Management: Exploring Fieldwork and Applications. Routledge, 2013. Anna Ferrieri designed the first chair from a single mould in 1968. Anna Castelli Ferrieri laid the Kartell foundations on geometric shapes, bold color, and highly polished finishes. In 1972, Ferrieri and her husband exhibited artwork in the ‚ÄúItaly: The New Domestic Landscape‚Äù exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. This exhibition featured her ‚ÄúComponobili‚Äù of 1969. One of her best known works is the Componibili. Componibilis are stacking module storage pieces. These units have been described as, \\"Flexible, functional and practical\\". and as \\"instantly endearing and slightly futuristic elegance that suits any situation with ease.\\" Today, even after 40 years of production the Componibili is still one of Kartell's best selling furniture items. A more compiled list of all of Ferrieri‚Äôs exhibitions are listed below. Ferrieri worked as art director for Kartell from 1976 to 1987, and is most known for her use of materials such as metal and polyurethane. Through her use of plastics, a fairly unused furniture material at the time, she was able to create novel forms that were both elegant and functional. She mediated between creativity of the designers and the needs of the technical project achievability ‚Äì all while still creating her own designs. Ferrieri married Giulio Castelli and the couple led the way in Italian modern design with Kartell throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s.‚ÄúAnna Castelli Ferrieri.‚Äù Design Within Reach. Accessed February 23, 2019. https://www.dwr.com/designer-anna-castelli-ferrieri?lang=en_US. In addition to her work, she founded and was a member of several organizations including; The Movement of Architecture Studies (MAS) of Milan, 1945; National Institution of Urban Planning (NIU), 1952-1956 and later became president from 1969-1971; Italian Industrial Design Association (IDA) in 1956. She also published two books; one in 1984, ‚ÄúFrom Project to Product: Plastic and Design‚Äù, and the second book was published in 1991, ‚ÄúThe Interface of Material‚Äù, which explains the responsible behavior on the part of designers. In addition, she also has published a profound list of articles. Style, technique, and artwork Ferrieri was a pioneering architect, commonly associated with post war Italian Modern Design. Her design focused on technological innovation through the use of new materials, like plastic. Ferrieri created more than 50 architectural projects, but some of her most famous and iconic works are as follow; the Kartell headquarters (with it being made from brilliant red blocks), a residential building on Via Marchiondi in Milan, and several offices and factories in Alfa Romeo. All of these were created in collaboration with Ignazio Gardella. Although, according to biographer Cristina Morozzi, Gardella took the recognition for projects that Ferrieri worked on because he wanted to be the master of his own studio. In 1982, she created the first table to be made of entirely injection molded plastic. In 1988, she created arm lounge chair that had a ‚Äúmarbleized‚Äù injection blend of plastic. Anna Ferrieri won numerous awards, including the prestigious Compasso d‚ÄôOro, an industrial design award given by ADI to acknowledge and promote high quality designs. However, her work is still in production which speaks the highest praise.

Anna Ferrieri found that balancing her roles of a designer, wife, and mother were often difficult. During the 1950s through the 1960s, the theme of incompatibility of professional and familial life was a key issue discussed publicly through the newsletter, 8th Pax Romana. The conversation developed into expectations of women and the primary roles as mothers and how these roles influence possibilities for careers. In 1971, one member of the AIDIA, said the biggest obstacle in women‚Äôs liberation was family. In the early 1970s, Ferrieri was asked by one of her husband‚Äôs aunts to join Soroptimists, which was an international feminist organization. By 1973, she was the president of this organization and presented ‚ÄúInternational and interdisciplinary action for the promotion of human rights and in particular the condition of women‚Äù to the United Nations. Ferrieri became an active feminist and her actions contrasted with other women architects of her time. Death Ferrieri died on June 22, 2006. in her home in Milan, at the age of 87, from complications of lung disease. She was survived by her husband, Giulio Castelli; daughter, Marial Castelli; and son, Valerio Castelli. Giulio Castelli passed away four months later at the age of 86.

She is described as an activist artist because of her work's social and political nature. She is also known for her feminist works. Abeles has exhibited her works in 22 countries and has received a number of significant awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship. Aside from her work as an artist, she was a professor in public art, sculpturing, and drawing at California State University, Northridge from 1998 to 2009, after which she became professor emerita in 2010. Early life and education Abeles was born in Richmond Heights, Missouri. As a child, she spent some time living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, an experience which she says influenced her work The Smog Collector. Abeles received her BFA in painting from Ohio University and earned a MFA in studio art from the University of California, Irvine in 1980. In connection with her thesis, about Shingon Buddhism, she created constructions incorporating kimonos. Critics connect Abeles' early works to those of Edward Kienholz and Wallace Berman, founders of the California assemblage tradition. Kienholz's The State Hospital was an early inspiration to Abeles. Work Abeles has worked in a variety of different mediums including repurposed materials, drawing, multimedia, sculpture and installations. She often experiments with materials. Intensive research, in which she immerses herself in her subject, is a significant part of her working process. Kim Abeles commented on her art as, \\"results from the urban experience, chronicling historical and contemporary issues housed in sculpture and installation.\\" Her work begins with a singular person or idea and through her own independent research and exploration will delve into her chosen topic until she feels comfortable beginning her artwork. She describes her artwork as the poetic spirit in a visual language. Many of her projects address contemporary social and environmental issues. She has explored topics including HIV/AIDS, pollution, gender roles, domestic violence, feminism, civil rights, and labor. Kim Abeles explores such topical issues through humor and metaphors. Most of her work has revolved around three central themes: civil rights, feminism, and the environment. With her range of media and distinctive styles, Kim Abeles seamlessly unites her call for activism with her work aesthetics through new innovative techniques. =Collaborative work = Abeles has worked with several educational organizations and schools to collaborate on installations and exhibitions. She has worked with the multiple art centers like: The Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, Community Arts Resource in Santa Monica, Orange Country Museum of Art Teen Council, the California Science Center, and the CU Museum of Natural History in Boulder. Her more defining collaborators include the Bureau of Automotive Repair, the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, and the Lakota Indians of South Dakota. =The Smog Collector= In 1987, her work Smog Collector caught national and international attention, mentioned in Newsweek, National Public Radio, CBS Evening News, and The Wall Street Journal. Abeles created an innovative technique, using stencils and adhesives to collect smog particulate and produce symbols and images. Abeles was motivated to create the project through her own curiosity and the effects of a year-long protest against a factory near her home that she said was \\"spewing formaldehyde\\". She considers the work an ongoing series to which she is currently contributing. =To Sit As Ladder (In Honor of Rosa Parks)= In some of her works pertaining to human rights, Abeles has taken a subjective approach that includes a presentation of individuals' portraits through text, maps, drawings, and objects. An example is her 1991 sculpture To Sit As Ladder (In Honor of Rosa Parks) which displayed a chair with text to represent the life of Rosa Parks. =HIV/AIDS Tarot= Abeles' HIV/AIDS Tarot cards incorporate both image and text, and discuss issues pertaining to the socioeconomic and medical aspects of AIDS. Only seven cards were issued, not a complete Tarot deck. They were printed in both English and Spanish, and used as part of a public health information program in Los Angeles in 1992. = Walk a Mile in My Shoes= The initial inspiration for Walk a Mile in My Shoes was the political work of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement. Searching for images of King's actual shoes, Abeles was deeply affected when she viewed civil rights activist Xernona Clayton's \\"profound collection of shoes belonging to members of the peace marches.\\" The installations she created at the intersections of Jefferson Blvd. and Rodeo Rd. and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. included bronze casts of King's work boots as well as photographs of national and local activists' shoes. Exhibitions Abeles has exhibited her work in twenty-two countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, the Czech Republic, England, China, and South Korea. Abeles' work has been shown at National Center for Atmospheric Research; Museum of Arts and Design in New York; National Museum of Fine Arts in Santiago; Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles; Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro; and, Intersection for the Arts in San Francisco. She has also been a United States representative in Antwerp for Fotografie Biennale Rotterdam and Cultural Centre of Berchem. Kim Abeles took her art to the road in 1993 with the release of Kim Abeles: Encyclopedia Persona A-Z. The collection, curated by Karen Moss of the Santa Monica Museum, was sponsored by The Fellows of Contemporary Art in North America and United States Information Agency in South America. Her art show Encyclopedia Persona, at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, featured a 15-year survey of her work; including 80 of her sculptures, installations and artist's books.

This plant, with an installed capacity of 62 MW and Rapides-des-Coeurs located downstream were put into service in 2008. Their construction was completed in 2009.  Geography  The Chute-Allard generating station is located less than five kilometres downstream from the territory of Wemotaci and 4.5 km downstream from the Weymont railway station. The power plant was built at kilometre point 297.6 on a large island forming two arms of the river. The plant has been built in the north arm of the rapids. Permanent access to the site is possible from La Tuque, by road 25 up to km 82; then a forest path leads on the right bank of the Saint-Maurice River near the downstream part of the fall-Allard. In this sector, the Canadian National Railway, linking La Tuque and Senneterre, was built south of the Saint-Maurice River, except for a segment approximately of 12.5 kilometres built on the north shore. The railway crosses the Saint- Maurice River, by the railway bridge built at km 302.5 (at Wemotaci) and the one of 290 km, just upstream of the \\"Rapides de la Graisse (du Li√®vre)\\". The CN Railway runs along the north shore of the water reservoir created by the hydroelectric dam at Chute-Allard. Small railway stations in the sector are: Ferguson (at km 267.5 km, 3.5 km upstream of Rapides-des-Coeurs), Vandry (at km 284), Dessane (at km 291) and Weymont (at km 301.5, near Wemotaci). Between Chute-Allard and Rapides-des-Coeurs, small tributaries flowing into the Saint- Maurice River are: * North Shore - the Rheaume Creek (located at 273.5 km on railway), which has its source in Lake Rheaume, at the west of Windigo River watershed; * South Shore : \\\\- Petite rivi√®re Flamand (Small Flemish River) (its mouth is located just upstream of Rapides-des-Coeurs) which supplies water including lakes Mons, Lavoie, Liege, Brussels, Aro, Bob-Grant, Dinant, Simard, and several other lakes in the area of forest Road 25; \\\\- Ruisseau D√©mon (Creek demon).Geographic searches performed by historian Ga√©tan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC), using Google Map, accessed via the Internet, on April 20, 2014 Between these two hydroelectric stations, the main rapids are : * \\"Rapides des Iroquois\\" (Iroquois Rapids), located between km 291.5 and km 292.5 (measured on railway); * \\"Rapides de la Graisse (Le Li√®vre)\\" (Rapids of the Fat) (Hare), located between km 287 to 290 (measured on railway). Furthermore, \\"Rapides Weymont\\" (Rapids Weymont) (with an approximate length of 0.5 km) are located one kilometre south of the railway bridge in Wemotaci, or 4 km upstream from the plant Allard Falls. The feed water upstream of Chute- Allard Generating Station and the tailrace downstream channel have been built along the north shore of Saint-Maurice River.Hydro-Qu√©bec, the document \\"Hydroelectric Development Chute-Allard and Rapides-des-Coeurs\\" - Review of environmental activities in 2009 - Released in June 2010  History  In April 2005, the provincial and federal authorities have authorized the completion of the hydro-electric project Chute-Allard and Rapides-des-Coeurs Generating Station.

Artwork  As an artist, Dara Greenwald's mission was \\"to make resistance visible, and present.\\" She was well known for her activist-oriented video and performance art as well as her many collaborations and organizing practice. Her 2005 video work United Victorian Workers was screened at a number of venues including Creative Time's major exhibition at the Park Avenue Armory in New York City, Democracy in America, curated by Nato Thompson, as well as the Aurora Picture Show, San Francisco Art Institute, and the Brecht Forum. In 2008, Greenwald completed Spectres of Liberty: Ghost of Liberty Street Church, a project in collaboration with artists Josh MacPhee and Olivia Robinson. In a feature in Sculpture Magazine, author Jesse Ball describes the work's intention as an attempt to \\"make the invisible visible, from daily routines to entire cultural moments\\" and \\"to re- create the fa√ßade of a missing building and thereby trigger its psycho- physical space in the landscape as well as its historical context.\\" The work consisted of an inflatable model of Liberty Street Presbyterian Church blown up in a parking lot and became a temporary community event space in Troy, NY.

In 2007, NPR credited Pink Bloque, whose members dressed in hot pink and practiced a protest strategy that members describe as \\"tactical flirting,\\" with re-inventing the \\"art of the protest.\\" By 2005, Chicago-based dance troupe grew to include activists dispersed across the United States. Some scholars have characterized their feminist \\"camp\\" protest strategies as an outgrowth of queer social movements like Act Up. By using, rather than subverting, sexist stereotypes, Pink Bloque members focused on engagement and conversation over confrontation strategies deployed by other protest groups. Core to the mission of \\"The Bloque\\" was a discourse rooted in plurality and collectivism. In conversation with the press, Bloque members would use two aliases‚ÄîEllen Jones and Julie Smith‚Äîin order to present a unified front and privilege a collective, rather than individual, voice.

The Imagists took their cues from Surrealism, Pop, and West Coast underground comic illustration, and were \\"enchanted with the abject status of sex in post-war America, particularly as writ on the female form.\\" Ramberg is best known for her depictions of partial female bodies (heads, torsos, hands) forced into submission by undergarments and imagined in odd, erotic predicaments.  Biography  Christina Ramberg was born on August 21, 1946 on the Kentucky military base of Camp Campbell where her father, Vernon Ramberg, was an army officer. Her mother, Norma, had a love of music, and had originally wanted to go a conservatory to pursue her musical career, but was unable to due to a lack of financial resources, although she did eventually teach music lessons. Due to Vernon's military service, the family moved frequently, including overseas. When Christina was two her family moved to Yokohama Japan for two-and-a-half-years, and she attended school in Germany during her third and fourth grades. In the United States, her family lived in Kansas, Virginia, and Highwood, Illinois (just north of Chicago) where Christina attended Highland Park High School for her junior and senior year. She earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1968 and her Master of Fine Arts in 1973 both from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where she studied with Ray Yoshida, who was a primary mentor of the Chicago Imagists group that Christina became a part of. Yoshida encouraged his students in the use of commercial and popular culture images such as comic books and magazines as a basis for their art. This is also where she met her husband Philip Hanson who was also an art student who studied with Yoshida and is also considered a member of the Chicago Imagists group. They were married in 1968, the same year that they both exhibited their work for the first time in the False Image show at the Hyde Park Art Center. They were also both faculty members at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Philip reflected years later that \\"students liked her a lot. A good woman teacher was important to them, particularly in that time. It was much more dominated by men, so to have a teacher like Christina, who was doing her own work, that was a big deal. The men could be very nice, but it was really meaningful to learn from another woman.\\" Ramberg and Hanson had one son, Alexander, who was born in 1975, although they did have a late term miscarriage before Alex, and both experiences greatly impacted her art. By 1980 her marriage to Hanson had become strained, and they eventually agreed to live apart, although they remained close for the rest of their lives. In 1989 Ramberg was diagnosed with Pick's disease or frontotemporal dementia, a rare form of dementia that attacks the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. When she could no longer live alone, Hanson took care of her until she had to go to an assisted living facility. She died in 1995 at the age of forty-nine.  Style and works  The depiction of the female torso is the most common motif in Ramberg's art, with the torso being corseted, girdled, and otherwise constricted and veiled by the bondage-like trappings of typical 1950s female garments. Ramberg relates a memory of watching her mother dress for a party in an interview: \\"She would wear these‚ÄîI guess that they are called 'Merry Widow[s]'‚Äîand I can remember being stunned by how it transformed her body, how it pushed up her breasts and slenderized down her waist. I think that the paintings have a lot to do with this, with watching and realizing that a lot of these undergarments totally transform a woman's body. ‚Ä¶ I thought it was fascinating ‚Ä¶ in some ways, I thought it was awful.\\" Another distinguishing feature of Ramberg's art is the absence of any faces, with the head not drawn at all, seen only from the back, or concealed by hair. The motif of the \\"hairdo\\" is likewise common in Ramberg's oeuvre, the hairstyle also being indicative of a type of mid-century female \\"conditioning\\" or conformity. Critic Katheryn Rosenfeld, in a 2000 New Art Examiner review states: \\"it's... hard not to read in the work a psycho- sexual inventory of the limitations of white middle-class womanhood at mid- century.\\" In keeping with their subject matter, Christina Ramberg's paintings are highly composed and finished to the point that they themselves are referred to as fetishistic. Worked on masonite in acrylic, they are precisely painted and are characterized by their low tone and mute palette. In a 2012 Art in America review by Nancy Princenthal, she describes the draftsmanship in Ramberg's 1970 Corset/Urn series this way: \\"inky black with spiky pink highlights, they are prim and sexily sinister... deft, dark and reticent.\\" In the 1970s, Ramberg's work evolved from its strict focus on the female form to less sexualized, even non-human forms such as urn forms, chair backs, and geometries \\"eliding the boundaries between figuration and abstraction, human and object.\\" Her human forms turned from figures seen from the back or in profile to fully frontal torsos that are more rigid and robotic, and have both male and female characteristics which gives her art a sense of androgyny and uncertainty. Still, her signature style remained: crisp, black outlines, muted colors, cropped forms, attention to pattern and detail. By the early 1980s Ramberg took a break from her exploration of the female body and started to quilt more actively than she had in the past. Like her paintings, the patterns in her quilts are crisp and exact, with complex combinations of contrasting colors and forms. In the mid to late 1980s Ramberg's artwork shifted to include a \\"satellite\\" motif that incorporated some patterns and shapes from her quilting, only her color palette was back to the gray, white, blue, and black of her earlier work instead of brighter colors. These later works are referred to as her \\"satellite\\" motif phase because the combination of circles, cones triangles, and lines resemble the plans for a telescope, satellite, or some other mechanical invention. = Exhibitions = Christina Ramberg did more group exhibitions than solo exhibitions during her life time, however she is getting recognized more and more in the contemporary art community with exhibitions of her artwork being displayed in recent years.

She became the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. After the assassination attempt on her husband, Pavel Gubarev, on 13 October 2014 she temporarily led the New Russia Party. Pavel Gubarev formed the Free Donbass movement in 2014. As a result of the death of Alexander Zakharchenko, there will be so-called \\"elections\\" in the Donetsk People's Republic. In September 2018, Pavel Gubarev went to Moscow and obtained permission to be a candidate for the post of head of the Donetsk People's Republic. As a result of this, the Gubarevs are being put under pressure by supporters of rival candidate, Denis Pushilin. Ekaterina Gubareva was set to head the Free Donbass party list for the \\"elections\\" of the People's Soviet of the Donetsk People's Republic of 11 November 2018. But on 29 September 2018, she was arrested and held in custody by unknown people, and so was unable to attend the party convention that day, with the result that she was excluded from the party list. At the convention, the movement was taken over by supporters of Denis Pushilin. After this incident she left for Rostov-on-Don.

Biography Santiago has worked as an actor, playwright, director, choreographer, dancer, and puppeteer. Born in Havana, Cuba, in 1944, he graduated from the Cuban National Dramatist School after studying literature at the University of Havana. In 1959 he cofounded the Children's Theatrical Movement in Cuba. The writer Virgilio Pi√±era was his literature professor and intimate friend throughout those years. In 1965 Santiago was accused of antisocial behavior. Five years later he was arrested, and his literary works were seized by the government. He was sentenced to three years' service in UMAP (Military Units to Aid Production), a type of forced labor camp where political dissidents were made to work in inhumane conditions. In 1979 he left Cuba for Spain. Santiago was eventually able to move to New York, where he resides today. Santiago has been active in promoting HIV awareness in New York City. He has shown a strong desire to portray the social and human impacts of the disease, which was a theme in his plays throughout the 1980s. He once said, \\"As a human being, I have tried to bring light to these dark times and unflaggingly struggled so that man does not become man's wolf.\\" Many of his plays have been performed in both Cuba and the United States. His short stories, essays, and plays have been published and translated into English, French, and Catalan. His play Vida y pasi√≥n de La Peregrina (Life and Passion of the Pilgrim) was awarded the University of Florida's Golden Letters Award, and its world premiere took place during the International Hispanic Theatre Festival of Miami in 1998.

Early on, Hoover was committed to becoming an artist. The choice between dance and the visual arts was decided in favour of painting and sculpture, mediums that allowed her an independent creative exploration.Between 1989 and 2006 Hoover was also involved in theatre and dance productions as collaborator and even realized a piece \\"Wrapped\\" (2006) for L'Usine, HetVeem Theater, Amsterdam NL. Studies at the Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington D.C. from 1950 - 1955 were followed by exhibitions of her sculptures, paintings and drawings, first in Washington and later in New York City. Her earliest dated works used expressive strokes, concentrated on individual figures with minimal background information and were largely executed in earthen tones.These observations are based on an incomplete overview of the paintings in the Nan Hoover estate, in private collections, or as documented in often unlabeled slides. Her interest in the human body and human psychology was too great to embrace an abstract expressionist style. Sometimes the figures would display physical abnormalities and/or be seen from unusual perspectives that indicated vulnerable socio-psychological or emotional states and thus contributed to the impression of being surreal.Rob Perr√©e's (2001) book: Dialogue. About Nan Hoover (Cologne: Salon Verlag) offers some insights into Nan Hoover's early work that profit from their collaboration. Isolated full figure studies and enigmatic relations between two or more figures predominate. She was also interested in the secrets of light. Her curiosity was enhanced through her visits to the Rembrandt van Rijn studies in oils in the Washington National Gallery of Art. In 1954 she married Harold Hoover. Between 1954 and 1958 they had three children. During this time a few of her paintings vaguely reflect upon family topics such as mother and child or child and parents, but are not autobiographical in nature. Hoover's first trip to Europe was in 1962. During the six months she was there she stayed in Paris, where she did small paintings and drawings. She also visited Berlin and mentioned in her curriculum vita of 1990 how moved she was by the recently built dividing wall.Curriculum vita in Nan Hoover estate records housed in the archive and collections of the Art Academy in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. She returned to New York City. In 1969 she visited Dutch friends in London and Amsterdam and decided, after having found a gallery in Amsterdam, to sublet her loft in New York and return to Amsterdam, the city with northern light and water, the city where Rembrandt lived and worked. She would often say that she fell in love with the city.Ayers, Robert. \\"Remembering Nan Hoover\\" ARTINFO, Retrieved 19 April 2014 By the end of the 1960s Hoover had reduced her figures to flat planes and contours before primary hues of red, blue and yellow. This was followed up by secondary colours and sexual, even aggressive poses. In 1971 she was introduced to Karel Appel, Dutch painter, sculptor and poet, who was looking for a caretaker for his Ch√¢teau Molesmes in France. Between 1971 and 1973 she would work at the ch√¢teau in France and commute to Amsterdam for exhibitions. In 1973 she met the Dutch painter Richard Hefti. Through him she had access to a video camera and began in 1973 to experiment with it.\\"Nan Hoover: Biography\\", New Media Encyclopedia, Retrieved 19 April 2014. In January 1974 she did her first street performance in Berlin. All her videos were produced in her studio before a fixed video camera and without post- editing. The closely cropped glimpses of the artist's body and dark and light contrasts have a nuanced visual flow and intimacy. In 1975 she and Richard Hefti married and she took on Dutch citizenship. In 1976 she made the acquaintance of Wies Smals, who opened the first multimedia space de Appel in Amsterdam. This alternative space rapidly became a lively centre of artistic exchange and provided Hoover with an invaluable support system.For further reading see De Appel: performances, installations, video, projects, 1975 - 1983, by Marga van Mechelen, 2006. Amsterdam: De Appel A measure of the international recognition of Hoover's art occurred in 1977 when she participated in the documenta 6 in Kassel and had screenings of her videotapes at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. She made her first colour videotape in 1978, \\"Impressions\\" (1978, colour, sound, 9'45\\"). While it is a performance of the hand interacting with and at times intercepting a light beam, it also seems at one point to visualize \\"writing with light\\", when the end of her index finger is positioned on the light beam. That same year she teamed up with the artist Sam Schoenbaum and did a performance tour through New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver and Montreal. In 1979 she teamed up with Peter Ungerleider to do a tour called \\"Lapses and Dissolves\\" which was shown in Washington D.C., Boston and Montreal. She showed her super 8 film \\"Lapses\\" (1977 - 1979, a selection of short silent colour films, 16'). In her own words: \\"These are short films about feelings of isolation.\\" While video and performance coexisted in her work, and are closely accompanied by photography, certain technical and aesthetic decisions appeared successively. Performances as mentioned above began in 1974, the first video performance in 1976, the first light installation as a performance environment in 1977. Performance as the initiation of an interactive light environment and/or video installation originate, according to Hoover's recollection, by chance after a light performance at the Kunstverein Heidelberg in 1981. According to her 1990 curriculum vita Nan Hoover made her first video installation for her 1979 solo show at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, where she also showed a photo installation, performance photos, video tapes as well as giving an opening performance. 1980 was to be a year of intense production for her, enabled by a DAAD grant to live and work in Berlin. Retrieved 19 April 2014. In the same year her film Fields of Blue (c.1980) was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.\\"FIELDS OF BLUE: Nan Hoover's Video Installation on View\\" MoMA, Retrieved 19 April 2014. The film displays three images of the artist appearing and disappearing into the picture frame. Of the several video tapes concerned with colour she made this year \\"Color Pieces\\" (1980, 9'51\\", according to EIA, 12'21\\", according to the Selected Work 1974 - 2002, Netherlands Media Art Institute, Amsterdam, 2009)The extensive collection of Nan Hoover's video work is now in the holdings of LIMA (Living Media Art), Arie Biemondstraat 111, 1054 PD Amsterdam, LIMA. is undoubtedly one of the most impressive.Recently shown in the exhibition \\"Images of an Infinite Film,\\" September 7, 2013 - 3 March 2014 at the Museum of Modern Art, organized by Erica Papernik, Assistant Curator, Department of Media and Performance Art, and showcasing mainly conceptual films from the 1970s, who describes the work as follows:\\"Color Pieces (1980), a video by Nan Hoover, deconstructs a fleeting moment into a subtly shifting topography of light and shadow.\\" Online: MoMA EXHIBITIONS Retrieved: 21 January 2014. The film \\"Doors\\" was produced in this year, too. It is a pivotal work in that its symbolic, metaphoric and visual rendition of a simple action which is echoed in later works whether by photographic, performative or drawing means. A good example is the photograph \\"Coming and Going\\" (1980, colour photograph, 42 x 124 cm). The result of this important year for her was a travelling solo exhibition with catalogue (DAAD Gallery, Berlin, Neue Galerie Aachen, Stedelijk Museum, Schiedham and K√ºnstlerhaus, Stuttgart). From 1981, Hoover often combined interactive light installations with performance (see a selection below). She would move slowly through her site, with specific light arrangements casting shadows onto the surfaces of the space and intercepting the bands of light that hidden light projectors with coloured cutout filters projected into the darkened spaces. These light installations would subsequently be open for the spectator/participant to explore. In an interview with Kate Elwers, Nan Hoover states: \\"I find it important, especially in the performances, that I give the public the space to go into themselves. I'm not interested in dictating my ideas, I'm interested in opening up...\\"Kate Elwes, 'Interview with Nan Hoover', Performance Magazine, No.23, April/Mai 1983. pp. 8-10, cited on p. 9. In the 1980s she would be represented at several video and performance festivals throughout the world, and by the mid eighties be included in group exhibitions of women artists. But she would always maintain that she was a painter, who from time to time would use different brushes. While teaching video and film at the D√ºsseldorf Art Academy and living in D√ºsseldorf, Hoover also produced some bronze sculptures and several series of large tactile charcoal drawings. It seems that her video tape \\"Watching out - a Trilogy\\" (1986, b/w, silent, 13') in which she used a drawing of her own as background precipitated this. In 1990 she wrote about it as follows: \\"(I) began to realize that I had a new vocabulary in light and movement that I could apply to drawing. (I) decided to concentrate on developing the drawings.\\" This she did until 1988 when she again made a video tape \\"Blue Mountains, Australia\\" (1988, colour, sound, 6'). During a trip to Poland the following year, she again filmed outdoors with a hand-held camera and writes about it the following year. \\"With this new tape I realized that I could adapt my thoughts about nature, nature's energies, to the medium of video\\". The black patina bronzes that followed represent a facet of this new focus on nature: \\"(I) have forms that resemble the earth, the earth thrust apart by an energy below, that is what I hope for from the sculptures.\\" Her interest in international issues in the art world included her engagement in and commitment to the International Artists Forum, of which she was a President for a term.For more about the IKG, refer to their website Internationales K√ºnstler Gremium Her works in public places include a permanent light object commissioned by Dutch Artline/Kunstlijn. \\"The Ls\\" was installed in the Hardenberg Railway Station, the Netherlands (realization by Richard Hefti) in 1990. It was based on a light object she had made for an exhibition in Kiel in 1983. In 1992 Hoover created a permanent light installation for the Stadtstheater Zoetermeer that was commissioned by the Gemeente Zoetermeer, Netherlands. In the same year choreographer Lucinda Childs commissioned the artist to create lighting and costumes for the ballet Naama in Charleroi, Belgium. In 2000 she made a video- installation at the Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Eberswalde, Germany; and that same year a steel and neon light object \\"U\\" was installed in the foyer of the M√ºnchener Kammerspiele, Munich, Germany. From the 1990s Nan Hoover staged spectacular indoor and outdoor light installations such as \\"Die Spur des Lichtes\\" at the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany, in 1991; \\"in/out\\" at the Institute for Artistic Research in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, in 1993; \\"Movement from either direction\\" in the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland in Bonn, Germany, in 1995; and \\"Movement in Light\\" in front of the Museum Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden, Germany in 1997. After her retirement from teaching in D√ºsseldorf, Hoover returned to Amsterdam. Though her video work after 1987 became less frequent, she produced some pieces concerned with light phenomena in nature, such as water studies and water projections. These depart from the simulations of landscapes such as \\"Returning to Fuji\\" (1984, colour and sound, 16'43\\") and \\"Desert\\" (1985, colour, 12'35\\"), which both address the recurring theme of perception in her artistic work. In her publication \\"Night Letters\\", (Cologne, Salon Verlag, 2000) Hoover writes: \\"it is not so important how we look at something but rather how we perceive this can be done in a second and last decades or a life time.\\" Hoover also continued to make light installations: \\"Art in Castles\\" in Kasteel Huis Bergh in 's-Heerenberg, the Netherlands, in 1997, and \\"Lichtrouten\\" in L√ºdenscheid, Germany, in 2002 and 2003. In 2005 Hoover moved to Berlin, where she continued to work, exhibit and lecture until her death in 2008. Significant video works were chosen by Nan Hoover shortly before her death and were published the following year in a limited edition by the Nan Hoover Foundation with the generous support of the Netherlands Media Art Institute as \\"Selected Works 1974 - 2002\\".

It was proposed in ICANN's New generic top- level domain (gTLD) Program, and became available to the general public on May 26, 2014. Top Level Design is the domain name registry for the string. History In June 2012, Top Level Design submitted an application to ICANN for the .wiki gTLD. On November 7, 2013, ICANN and Top Level Design entered into a \\"Registry Agreement\\", officially allowing the company to operate as the registry for .wiki. Following the acquisition, Ray King, CEO of Top Level Design, stated many people \\"from within [the domain] industry tell me that .wiki is their dark horse for a successful [g]TLD,\\" because \\".wiki\\" describes the site format. \\"So, when I go to craftbeer.wiki, I can expect a vibrant site with passionate folks discussing all things relevant to brewing beer. This is not the case with craftbeer.com or craftbeer.guru, where you could be accessing a storefront, a blog, a brewery tourguide or any number of things.\\" In January 2014, .wiki was named one of the \\"Top 10 gTLDs to Watch in 2014\\" by ClickZ for having the \\"potential to provide great secure, shared workspaces for companies large and small\\". The application was delegated to the DNS root zone on February 19, 2014. By mid-March, Top Level Design had signed agreements with more than 120 domain name registrars to retail .wiki names. It was announced in May that the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organization mostly known for hosting Wikipedia, would use \\"w.wiki\\" as a URL shortener. The Foundation also endorsed Top Level Design's proposal to ICANN's Registry Services Evaluation Process to unblock 179 two-letter strings representing language codes (all two-character strings are blocked under ICANN's standard Registry Agreement). .wiki domain registrations were available to only trademark holders until May 5; they became available to the general public on May 26, 2014. Note: Posted by Michael Berkens. According to Domain Name Wire, more than 3,000 .wiki domains were registered on the first day of general availability. As part of the gTLD's launch, Top Level Design and YouGov released a report which concluded that nearly half of consumers in the United Kingdom and the United States have \\"little to no opportunity\\" to collaborate with their favorite brands online, and prefer brands that make online collaboration available to them. An additional fifteen percent of U.K. consumers wished they could collaborate with their favorite brands on future products. Finally, the report said nearly a quarter of U.K. and U.S. consumers want companies to solicit their ideas for future products and would contribute to a branded wiki \\"if they could make a difference to an organisation, brand, service or community they feel passionately about\\". King acknowledged his interest in promoting collaboration between companies and consumers, given the collaborative nature of wikis and Top Level Design's acquisition of the .wiki gTLD. He said of the study's findings: In July 2015, .wiki was included in a list of the \\"Top 20 Best New gTLDs Based on Quality\\", based on data gathered from more than 20,000 developed websites on new gTLD domains, as part of Globe Runner's New gTLD SEO Power Rankings Index. Purpose In its 2012 application, Top Level Design stated that the purpose of the .wiki top-level domain would be \\"to create a designated Internet space for wikis. This [gTLD] will clearly identify wikis from among the millions of other websites populating the Internet, and allow Internet users to easily find wikis relevant to their interests. Wiki websites are a growing phenomenon on the Internet and an innovative, easy-to-use peer-production method of creating and presenting information. They are generally open and editable and often community-driven; furthermore, individual wikis and the wiki platform are in constant flux in much the same way that the Internet as a whole is in flux. Wikis, like the broader Internet, are repositories of information that depend on each individual user to create value; they are meeting points and revolutionary ways to share ideas and knowledge; and they are both set to be expanded through the implementation of ICANN‚Äôs New gTLD Program, and a .wiki [gTLD] specifically. We believe a .wiki [gTLD] is an intuitive and necessary addition to the collection of new gTLDs to be added as a result of the New gTLD Program.\\" Note: User must click on \\"download public portion of application\\" under \\"String: WIKI\\".

They were named by , who introduced Rankin‚ÄìCohen algebras as an abstract setting for Rankin‚ÄìCohen brackets. Definition If f(\\\\tau) and g(\\\\tau) are modular form of weight k and h respectively then their nth Rankin‚ÄìCohen bracket [f,g]n is given by :[f,g]_n = \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi i)^n}\\\\sum_{r+s=n} (-1)^r\\\\binom{k+n-1}{s}\\\\binom{h+n-1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^r f}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau^r}\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^s g}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau^s} \\\\ . It is a modular form of weight k + h + 2n. Note that the factor of (2\\\\pi i)^n is included so that the q-expansion coefficients of [f, g]_n are rational if those of f and g are. d^rf/d\\\\tau^r and d^s g/d\\\\tau^s are the standard derivatives, as opposed to the derivative with respect to the square of the nome which is sometimes also used. Representation theory The mysterious formula for the Rankin‚ÄìCohen bracket can be explained in terms of representation theory. Modular forms can be regarded as lowest weight vectors for discrete series representations of SL2(R) in a space of functions on SL2(R)/SL2(Z). The tensor product of two lowest weight representations corresponding to modular forms f and g splits as a direct sum of lowest weight representations indexed by non-negative integers n, and a short calculation shows that the corresponding lowest weight vectors are the Rankin‚ÄìCohen brackets [f,g]n.

Early life and education Riva Helfond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. She spent some of her childhood in Russia and returned to New York at the age of eleven, living in New York or New Jersey for most of the rest of her life. Between 1928 and 1940, she studied at the School of Industrial Art and the Art Students League; her teachers included William von Schlegell, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Morris Kantor for painting and Harry Sternberg for printmaking. Among her fellow students were Alexander Brook and her future husband, the sculptor William (Bill) Barrett (d. 1967). Teaching Helfond began teaching in the College Art Association Program (1933‚Äì36) and then taught printmaking at the Harlem Arts Community Center (1936‚Äì38). Initially she taught lithography alongside Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Robert Joseph and others before moving to the graphic arts division, where she worked with Louis Lozowick and Jacob Kainen, and the silkscreen division, which was supervised by Anthony Velonis and which had Harry Gottlieb and Elizabeth Olds as founding members. Among her students at the Center was Robert Blackburn, who would go on to found New York's Printmaking Workshop in the 1940s. Later on, Helfond taught printmaking at New York University (1964), and she was on the faculty of Union College in Cranford, New Jersey, from 1980 onwards. Artwork From 1936 to 1941, Helfond was an artist in the New York Works Progress Administration program's graphics division, creating work in a variety of media, including lithographs, woodcuts, etchings, aquatints, collograph, and silkscreens. Some of her work shows the impact that color had as it entered American printmaking during this period, and she was adventurous in exploring the possibilities opened up by screen printing.Viso, Olga M. \\"The Golden Age of American Printmaking 1900-1950.\\" In Artists of the American Scene: A Selection from the Dr. Robert B. and Mrs. Dorothy M. Gronlund Collection of Twentieth-Century American Prints, Norton Gallery of Art exhibition catalog, 1994. She printed all of her own work, which ranged from austere, often monochromatic social realist portraits of working people and cityscapes in the 1920s and 1930s to colorful, abstract, lyrical landscapes in later years. Some of her color abstractions originated as watercolors from nature during travels in Greece and France and were then turned into oil paintings. Helfond was politically progressive, and along with contemporaries like Elizabeth Olds, Beatrice Mandelman, and Minna Citron, she is especially well known for works that \\"pointedly condemned the state of labor, and the relationship between big business and big government, in the 1930s.\\" Doss, Erika. \\"Toward an Iconography of American Labor: Work, Workers, and the Work Ethic in American Art, 1930-1945.\\" Design Issues, 1997, pp. 53-66. Examples of these include Custom Made (1940), a lithograph showing a woman slumped over her work in a WPA sewing room, and Snow Clearing (1933), showing men at work shoveling a street. There are also a number of prints about the grim lives of coal miners, such as Miner and Wife (1937), an American Gothic-style portrait of a couple, with the husband showing a closed fist; Out of the Pit (1935), a double portrait of miners with blackened faces; and Coal Picker (1938), showing elderly women scavenging in a coal mine.Doherty, Elizabeth M. \\"Viewing Work Historically Through Art: Incorporating the Visual Arts into Organizational Studies.\\" Journal of Management History, vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, pp. 137-153. After Helfond married Bill Barrett, whose Welsh relatives worked in the mines, she used these new connections to bring other artists interested in social justice together with the miners. Helfond ran into several obstacles while working in the coal districts of Pennsylvania. For one thing, she was irked that the gatherings of miners and her male artist friends in the local bars tended to exclude her and other women, making it harder for her to develop the relationships necessary to her work.Langa, Helen. Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New York. University of California Press, 2004, p. 110. Another obstacle sprang from cultural differences: Helfond recounted how in the mining town of Lansford, the local women became less friendly when she revealed that she was Jewish.Kaplan, Marion A., and Deborah Dash Moore, eds. Gender and Jewish History. Indiana University Press, 2011, p. 273. Despite these challenges, Helfond's prints of coal miners are considered an important addition to the body of work documenting the lives of the working poor during the New Deal.Francey, Mary. \\"American Women at Work: Women Printmakers and the Federal Art Project\\". 2008. Her work was included in the 1940 MoMA show American Color Prints Under $10. The show was organized as a vehicle for bringing affordable fine art prints to the general public. Helfond was also included in the 1947 and 1951 Dallas Museum of Fine Arts exhibitions of the National Serigraph Society. Helfond's work has been exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1960), the Newark Museum of Fine Arts (1964, 1967), and elsewhere. It is represented in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Brooklyn Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Art, the Springfield Museum of Fine Art, the Newark Museum of Fine Art, and the Library of Congress, among other institutions. In 2009, her work was featured in the exhibition \\"Industrial Strength: Precisionism and New Jersey\\" at the Jersey City Museum. Helfond counted as friends a wide circle of Abstract Expressionist artists and critics, including Willem DeKooning, Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, and Harold Rosenberg.Greengard, Stephen. \\"Ten Crucial Years: A Panel Discussion by Six WPA Artists.\\" Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts, vol. 1, no. 1, Spring 1986, pp. 46-48. In later life she lived in Plainfield, New Jersey, where she owned and managed the Barrett Art Gallery on East Front Street, which she had started with her husband in the 1960s. In the early 1950s, she designed a rose window for the First Unitarian Society of Plainfield's All Souls Church.

Indifference graphs are also the intersection graphs of sets of unit intervals, or of properly nested intervals (intervals none of which contains any other one). Based on these two types of interval representations, these graphs are also called unit interval graphs or proper interval graphs; they form a subclass of the interval graphs. Equivalent characterizations Forbidden induced subgraphs for the indifference graphs: the claw, sun, and net (top, left‚Äìright) and cycles of length four or more (bottom) The finite indifference graphs may be equivalently characterized as *The intersection graphs of unit intervals, *The intersection graphs of sets of intervals no two of which are nested (one containing the other),. *The claw-free interval graphs, *The graphs that do not have an induced subgraph isomorphic to a claw K1,3, net (a triangle with a degree-one vertex adjacent to each of the triangle vertices), sun (a triangle surrounded by three other triangles that each share one edge with the central triangle), or hole (cycle of length four or more),. As cited by . *The incomparability graphs of semiorders, *The undirected graphs that have a linear order such that, for every three vertices ordered u‚Äìv‚Äìw, if uw is an edge then so are uv and vw. *The graphs with no astral triple, three vertices connected pairwise by paths that avoid the third vertex and also do not contain two consecutive neighbors of the third vertex,. *The graphs in which each connected component contains a path in which each maximal clique of the component forms a contiguous sub-path,. *The graphs whose vertices can be numbered in such a way that every shortest path forms a monotonic sequence, *The graphs whose adjacency matrices can be ordered such that, in each row and each column, the nonzeros of the matrix form a contiguous interval adjacent to the main diagonal of the matrix.. *The induced subgraphs of powers of chordless paths.. *The leaf powers having a leaf root which is a caterpillar. For infinite graphs, some of these definitions may differ. Properties Because they are special cases of interval graphs, indifference graphs have all the properties of interval graphs; in particular they are a special case of the chordal graphs and of the perfect graphs. They are also a special case of the circle graphs, something that is not true of interval graphs more generally. In the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model of random graphs, an n-vertex graph whose number of edges is significantly less than n^{2/3} will be an indifference graph with high probability, whereas a graph whose number of edges is significantly more than n^{2/3} will not be an indifference graph with high probability.. The bandwidth of an arbitrary graph G is one less than the size of the maximum clique in an indifference graph that contains G as a subgraph and is chosen to minimize the size of the maximum clique.. This property parallels similar relations between pathwidth and interval graphs, and between treewidth and chordal graphs. A weaker notion of width, the clique-width, may be arbitrarily large on indifference graphs.. However, every proper subclass of the indifference graphs that is closed under induced subgraphs has bounded clique-width.. Every connected indifference graph has a Hamiltonian path.. An indifference graph has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if it is biconnected.. Indifference graphs obey the reconstruction conjecture: they are uniquely determined by their vertex-deleted subgraphs.. Algorithms As with higher dimensional unit disk graphs, it is possible to transform a set of points into their indifference graph, or a set of unit intervals into their unit interval graph, in linear time as measured in terms of the size of the output graph. The algorithm rounds the points (or interval centers) down to the nearest smaller integer, uses a hash table to find all pairs of points whose rounded integers are within one of each other (the fixed-radius near neighbors problem), and filters the resulting list of pairs for the ones whose unrounded values are also within one of each other.. It is possible to test whether a given graph is an indifference graph in linear time, by using PQ trees to construct an interval representation of the graph and then testing whether a vertex ordering derived from this representation satisfies the properties of an indifference graph. It is also possible to base a recognition algorithm for indifference graphs on chordal graph recognition algorithms. Several alternative linear time recognition algorithms are based on breadth-first search or lexicographic breadth-first search rather than on the relation between indifference graphs and interval graphs..... Once the vertices have been sorted by the numerical values that describe an indifference graph (or by the sequence of unit intervals in an interval representation) the same ordering can be used to find an optimal graph coloring for these graphs, to solve the shortest path problem, and to construct Hamiltonian paths and maximum matchings, all in linear time. A Hamiltonian cycle can be found from a proper interval representation of the graph in time O(n\\\\log n), but when the graph itself is given as input, the same problem admits linear-time solution that can be generalized to interval graphs... List coloring remains NP-complete even when restricted to indifference graphs.. However, it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the total number of colors in the input. Applications In mathematical psychology, indifference graphs arise from utility functions, by scaling the function so that one unit represents a difference in utilities small enough that individuals can be assumed to be indifferent to it. In this application, pairs of items whose utilities have a large difference may be partially ordered by the relative order of their utilities, giving a semiorder.. In bioinformatics, the problem of augmenting a colored graph to a properly colored unit interval graph can be used to model the detection of false negatives in DNA sequence assembly from complete digests..

In November 2013, following deletion of the ST1300 model, Honda announced the CTX1300, which was powered by a version of the ST1300's engine modified for better fuel economy and increased torque at low RPMs. Abandoning the Pan-European bias of the ST1300, the CTX1300 reverted to a North American theme, with its half-fairing, raked-back handlebar and bagger styling.

Eaten together they provide a sweet and sour taste sensation. The tradition may have come from France. They are sold at the mid-spring Flower Mart held by the Women's Civic League. These simple 'drinks' are made by cutting the top off a small lemon, cutting a hole into the flesh, and shoving a soft peppermint stick into it. Sucking on the stick and squeezing the lemon produces a sweet, minty, lemony drink.

Early life and education Ali-Marie Payne was born in Jackson, Tennessee and raised in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Payne explained her nickname JR: \\"My Dad used to watch Dallas, and J. R. Ewing was a tough guy, so he started calling me J.R.\\" She attended Windsor Secondary School in North Vancouver. Payne attended Saint Mary's College, where she would play point guard for the Saint Mary's Gaels from 1995 to 1999. During her senior season, Payne helped lead the Gaels to their first ever NCAA Tournament appearance. She earned two first-team All- West Coast Conference honor. In 1999, Payne graduated from Saint Mary's with a degree in French, then attended San Francisco State University for a year for graduate school. Coaching career =Gonzaga Bulldogs Assistant Coach (2000-2005)= In 2000, Payne began her women's basketball coaching career at Gonzaga under Kelly Graves. The team improved from five wins in 2000‚Äì01 to 28 wins in the 2004-05 season, including a perfect record in West Coast Conference play. Payne helped recruit guard Shannon Mathews, who would become the first All-American in program history. =Boise State Broncos Assistant Coach (2005-2009)= In 2005, Payne became an assistant coach at Boise State under Gordy Presnell. During her time as assistant, Boise State won Western Athletic Conference titles two of her three years and made the NCAA Tournament. Boise State finished 24-8 twice in a row, including a perfect 14-0 home record in the 2007-08 season. =Southern Utah Thunderbirds Head Coach (2009-2014)= In 2009, JR Payne got her first head coaching position, at Southern Utah. In five seasons, Payne led Southern Utah to a record 23-win season, Big Sky Conference regular season co-championship, and first-ever postseason appearance in program history in the 2014 Women's National Invitation Tournament. =Santa Clara Broncos Head Coach (2014-2016)= On April 6, 2014, Payne became head coach at Santa Clara. Payne was head coach at Santa Clara for two seasons. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, the Santa Clara Broncos made the WNIT returned to the postseason for the first time in ten years. Following Santa Clara's exit from the WNIT, Payne was offered the Head Coach position at the University of Colorado-Boulder (Pac-12), The University of Arizona (Pac-12), and the University of New Mexico (Mountain West). =Colorado Buffaloes Head Coach (2016-present)= On March 28, 2016, Payne became head coach at Colorado. The eighth head coach in program history, Payne replaced Linda Lappe, who was fired after only managing only a career 33-57 (.367) record in Pac-12 play. JR Payne inherited a program that only finished 7-23 (2-16 Pac-12) in Lappe's final season. JR Payne inherited a program that had a lack of player talent. The Buffs were only 14-58 (.194) in the last four years of Linda Lappe's coaching tenure in Pac-12 play, despite having the program's All-Time assists leader in each year during that time frame. Colorado finished the 2018-19 season with a 2-16 Pac-12 record. In it 45 years history, it marked the fifth time that the Buffs failed to win at least three conference games. Payne's 2018-19 Colorado team began Pac-12 conference play 0-11, the worst start to conference play in program history. The 102-43 loss at Oregon was the Buffs' worst loss since 1984 and it was the 4th worst loss in program history. Prior to the start of the 2019-20 season, the Buffs was anticipated to continue to struggle, and were picked to finish last place in the Pac-12 Women's Basketball Coaches poll by fellow Pac-12 coaches. Yet, Payne and her staff invested in completely remaking the culture of the Colorado Buffs women's basketball team and the team bought in. The Buffs finally turned the corner from the program's struggles to play at a competitive level within the Pac-12 conference and jumped straight to playing competitively against the top nationally ranked teams within the conference. The Buffs put a scare into #6 ranked Stanford, taking the Cardinal to overtime. Colorado put a scare into #8 ranked UCLA, having a chance to tie the game on the last possession. Colorado, once again, played competitively against Stanford, but lost on a half court buzzer beater on a crucial turnover. Colorado upset #11th ranked Arizona on Feb 23, 2020 to get their fifth Pac-12 win on the season. It marked the first win over a ranked opponent since 2016 and stopped a 32 games losing streak against ranked opponents.

In the 2011 census, Bingil Bay had a population of 369 people. History The name Bingil is believed to be an Aboriginal word meaning a good camping ground given to the area by Frederick Cutten, a pioneer settler in the area. In 1884, the Cutten brothers (Frederick, Leonard, Sydney and James) established the first commercial tea plantation in Australia on their Bicton estate at Bingil Bay, also growing coffee, mangoes, bananas, pineapples and other tropical fruit. At that time, Bingil Bay was only accessible by boat. Most of the Bicton estate was destroyed by a cyclone in 1918 and although the homestead was rebuilt the remainder of the estate was never restored. The descendants of the original tea plants were rediscovered in the rain-forest by Dr Alan Maruff in 1958 and seedlings from these plants formed the basis for the Nerada tea plantations. In 1921, an overland connection was created from El Arish (a distance of away) but it was only usable by a dray and the journey took most of the day. The area was formerly known as Clump Point (the name of a nearby headland) until 1929 when a post office called Bingal Bay was established. On 9 July 1936, the road from El Arish to Bingil Bay was finally completed, reducing the travel time to 30 minutes. It was officially opened by Percy Pease, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Herbert. The Bingil Bay Lifesaving Club opened in 1936. Around 1966, then Prime Minister of Australia, Harold Holt and his wife Zara Holt, owned a holiday cottage they called \\"The Shack\\" at Bingil Bay. It sat high on the hill with views as far as Dunk Island. The couple were keen spearfishers. The cottage did not have a telephone. In the 2011 census, Bingil Bay had a population of 369 people.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Mason-Watkins House is located in a rural setting in southwestern Surry, at the northwest corner of Old Walpole and Mine Ledge Roads. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide, with a central chimney, and simple window casings. Windows are arranged symmetrically around the center entrance, which is topped by a four-light transom window. A single-story ell extends to the rear, terminating in a former carriage house converted to garage. The interior has a typical Colonial central chimney plan, with a narrow vestibule that includes a tight triple-run staircase, with the parlor and dining room flanking the chimney. The fireplace surrounds in these two rooms are original, exhibiting Federal period styling. The house was built in 1832 by an unknown builder. The interior woodwork drawing inspiration from Asher Benjamin's 1806 American Builder's Companion, an indication of the conservative style the house exhibits.

Applied by world-famous poker pro Phil Ivey and subsequently challenged in court by the casino in which he did so, the UK High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court ruled that the technique, which requires the player to trick the dealer into rotating specific, high-value cards, is cheating in civil law, and that a casino was justified in refusing payment of winnings. This ruling would not be applicable if the player simply took advantage of an observed error or anomaly in the deck for which he was not responsible. Technique Many packs of cards produced by manufacturers have unintentional, almost indistinguishable edge irregularities. Typically the backs of every card in such a pack are identical, but the two long edges of each card are distinguishable from one another: the back pattern of one card is not symmetrical to another that has been rotated 180¬∞ (half a full turn). During the course of a game, the player asks the dealer to rotate high-value face-up cards, saying for example that they feel it will bring them luck. The dealer, indulging superstition, does not realize he or she is unwittingly orienting the cards such that valuable high cards are oriented one way in the deck and low cards the other way round. The unintentional card edge irregularity thus makes the high or low value of face-down cards apparent to an observer aware of how the dealer has been tricked into orienting them. This orientation will remain so long as the cards are not \\"washed,\\" shuffled in a way that rotates them. Thus, the player must also request that the dealer shuffle the cards with an automatic shuffler, which does not change the orientation as a manual shuffle might. The dealer is not obliged to comply with any of these requests, but will usually do so if thought to be the result of gambler superstition or mistrust. Over the course of a game being played this way, low cards will tend to be oriented one way, high cards the other. Once a significant proportion of cards have been rotated, any player who knows this can gain a statistical edge more than outweighing house edge by using the knowledge whether the card to be turned is likely to be low or high. Legality Casinos usually regard this technique as cheating; many players consider that they are legitimately playing to gain an advantage. In 2012, poker player Phil Ivey and partner Cheung Yin Sun won US$9.6 million playing baccarat at the Borgata casino. In April 2014, the Borgata filed a lawsuit against Ivey and Cheung for their winnings. In 2016, a Federal Judge ruled that Ivey and Cheung Yin Sun must repay US$10 million to the Borgata. U.S. District Judge Noel Hillman ruled that they did not commit fraud, but did breach their contract with the casino. He found that they did not abide by a New Jersey Casino Controls Act provision that prohibited marking cards. Although they did not mark the cards, they used tiny imperfections in the cards to gain an advantage. Later in 2012 he was reported to have won ¬£7.7 million (approx. $11 million) playing punto banco, a version of baccarat, at Crockfords casino in London. Crockfords refunded his ¬£1 million stake and agreed to send him his winnings, but ultimately refused payment. Ivey sued them for payment, but lost in the UK High Court; it was judged that the edge sorting was \\"cheating for the purpose of civil law\\". It was accepted that Ivey and others genuinely considered that edge sorting was not cheating, and deemed immaterial that the casino could easily have protected itself. Critically, the judgment pointed out that Ivey had gained an advantage by actively using a croupier as his innocent agent, rather than taking advantage of an error or anomaly on the casino's part. Ivey appealed against the judgement but was unsuccessful. He further appealed to the UK Supreme Court (see Ivey v Genting Casinos) which also decided in favour of the casino. All five justices upheld the decision of the court of appeal, \\"which dismissed his case on the basis that dishonesty was not a necessary element of 'cheating'.\\" See also * Card counting, another strategy that improves statistical odds, not considered cheating * One-way deck References Gambling terminology Comparing card games Cheating in gambling ","title":"Edge sorting"},{"id":"42535582","text":"Peter Williams (born 20 April 1948), CBE is the former Chief Executive of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), and the current Honorary President of the British Accreditation Council for Independent Further and Higher Education (BAC).

Background  Zhang Yanhan was born in 884. He was from Suiyang (Áù¢ÈôΩ, in modern Shangqiu, Henan), but little is stated about his family background in the traditional sources. Late during Tang, he served as the military advisor to the prefect of Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). However, at one point, he took a leave to see his uncle Zhang Shensi (), who was then serving as the acting military governor of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). He informed Zhang Shensi his opinion that northern China was about to fall into complete chaos and that he wanted to head to the region between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers (which was then under the rule of the major warlord Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu)), so that the family line could be extended. Zhang Shensi agreed with his analysis and sent him on his way.  During Wu  Tang ended in 907, and the realm fractured into several states, with Yang Xingmi's domain, then ruled by his son and successor Yang Wo, becoming the state of Hongnong (later known as Wu).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Zhang Yanhan initially served there as the magistrate of Yancheng County (ÈπΩÂüé, in modern Yancheng, Jiangsu), and was said to have been capable. He was later promoted to be the military commander of the army at Chu Prefecture (Ê•öÂ∑û, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). In 918, when then-Wu regent Xu Wen's adoptive son Xu Zhigao became junior regent at Wu's capital Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou) (as Xu Wen himself was stationed at Sheng Prefecture (ÊòáÂ∑û, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu)), Xu Zhigao was given the title of military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Jiang Prefecture (Ê±üÂ∑û, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. but obviously could not govern Jiang himself from Guangling; therefore, he sent Zhang there, as his secretary, to actually govern the prefecture. At a later point,The Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, apparently inheriting an assertion in its source, the Book of Southern Tang authored by the Song historian Lu You, indicated that this occurred at the time that Xu Zhigao took the throne as emperor (937), but this would be completely inconsistent with the rest of the timeline of Zhang's career as given in both the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms as well as other more established sources, and therefore will be disregarded here. See Book of Southern Tang, vol. 6. It could be referring to Xu Zhigao's assumption of greater regency powers upon Xu Wen's death or the assumption of imperial title by then-ruler of Wu, Yang Pu, both occurring in 927. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Zhang returned to the Wu imperial government to serve as an imperial censor (ÊÆø‰∏≠‰æçÂæ°Âè≤, Dianzhong Shi Yushi), and was put in charge, in an acting capacity, of the office of the imperial censors. At that time, the general Zhang Xuan () was one of the commanders of the guards for the capital Guangling, and was, due to his accomplishments, arrogant and violent. Zhang Yanhan submitted an indictment against Zhang Xuan, which caused other similarly arrogant generals to become apprehensive and to curb their behavior. Zhang Yanhan was later promoted to be the deputy minister of rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang). This caused him to appreciate Xu Zhigao (who was full regent by that point) greatly, as he had not previously been considered a close associate of the regent. At that time, Wu had not held imperial examinations ‚Äî a Tang tradition for selecting officials for the imperial government; rather, it would be that people would be selected based on contents of petitions they submitted. Xu put Zhang in charge reinstituting the imperial examinations, and Zhang performed the task capably, paying attention to promoting the impoverished and not being intimidated by those with honored backgrounds, such that the administrators under him were respecting him as if he were a deity. After Xu Zhigao's son Xu Jingtong became junior regent in 930,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Xu Jingtong was impressed with Zhang, and stated to others, \\"Mr. Zhang's opinions are fair and his decisions are well-reasoned. His listing of matters are detailed and clear. I should listen to him wholeheartedly.\\" Zhang eventually was put in charge of overseeing all six ministries of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng) and became respected by the people. When he was in his 50s, he was given the titles of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng)) and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor. Even though he was by no means old, the people still commented at the time that it was regrettable that he was not chancellor earlier.  During Southern Tang  In 937, Xu Zhigao had Yang Pu yield the throne to him, ending Wu and starting a new state of Southern Tang, with Xu as its emperor. (Xu would, in the following year, change his family name back to his birth name of Li and take on a new personal name of Bian.) He commissioned Zhang Yanhan, as well as fellow former Wu chancellors Zhang Juyong and Li Jianxun, chancellors of his new state.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. It was said that some time thereafter, Zhang Yanhan fell ill. As Li Bian still hoped that Zhang would be able to serve as chancellor, he did not allow Zhang to resign, but rather repeatedly send emissaries to oversee his treatment and make sure that he was given the best medications. Despite this, Zhang died around the new year 941. He was given posthumous honors.

The law also establishes criteria a memorial must meet in order to be approved the NCMAC, and establishes a seven-year deadline by which construction must begin or the memorial loses its congressional authorization. As of April 2014, the law has been amended five times, most notably by the Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-126). Commemorative Works Act of 1986 =Legislative history= By 1986, there were 110 national monuments, memorials, and statues in Washington, D.C., and its immediate environs. The pressure to build more memorials on the National Mall was extremely heavy, with roughly 15 new proposals being introduced in each session of Congress. Approximately 25 additional memorials had been seriously proposed but lacked a congressional sponsor to introduced authorizing legislation in Congress. The sheer number of memorials being proposed was not the only problems. The memorials were increasingly large, and often included extensive exhibits that threatened to turn memorials into miniature museums. On March 11, 1986, Representative Mo Udall (D-Arizona) introduced H.R. 4378, the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, in the United States House of Representatives. The bill was favorably reported by the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs on April 23, and passed the House by voice vote on May 5. A companion bill, S. 2522, was introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyoming) on June 5. The bill was assigned to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which favorably reported the bill with amendments on August 15. The bill passed the Senate, with additional amendments, by voice vote on September 10. The House made additional amendments of its own, and concurred with the Senate bill by voice vote on September 29. The Senate concurred with the House-amended bill by voice vote on October 16. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law on November 14, 1986. The Commemorative Works Act (CWA) established \\"significant procedural roadblocks\\" to the creation of new memorials. =Provisions= Section 2(c) of the Commemorative Works Act of 1986 defines a \\"commemorative work\\" as a garden, memorial, memorial grove, monument, sculpture, statue, or other structure or landscape feature designed to perpetuate the memory of a person, group, or event.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 2(c). Map showing the Reserve (greyed out area), Area I (within black boundary) and Area II of the National Capital Area. Section 2(e) established specific zones within the National Capital Region to which various rules established by the Act would apply. Working with the General Services Administration and the National Park Service, Congress had on May 1, 1986, created a map (number 869/86501) of these areas, which it named Area I and Area II. Area I roughly encompassed a zone extending from the White House to the United States Capitol; from the Capitol along Maryland Avenue SW to and along the 14th Street Bridge; the Virginia shore of the Potomac River from the 14th Street Bridge to Columbia Island; Columbia Island; the National Park Service land fronting Arlington National Cemetery (excluding Memorial Drive) north to Key Bridge; Key Bridge due east across the Potomac River to Rock Creek; Rock Creek north to 26th Street NW and L Street NW; south on 26th Street NW to I Street NW; roughly west from the intersection of I and 26th Streets NW to the National Park Service land on the D.C. shore of the Potomac River; south along the Potomac River to West Potomac Park (including the grounds of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts); east along the National Mall to The Ellipse; and north to the White House. Area II consisted of those parts of the National Capital Area outside Area I.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 2(e). Section 3(a) of the Act barred establishment of a memorial anywhere within Area I or Area II without specific authorization by Congress.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 3(a). Section 4(a) of the Act formally established the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee (NCMAC). This committee had been informally established earlier by the United States Department of the Interior. The Act charged NCMAC with administering the Commemorative Works Act, and specified the membership of the committee. These were:Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 4(a). *Director of the National Park Service (who was also designated the committee's chair) *Architect of the Capitol *Chair of the American Battle Monuments Commission *Chair of the United States Commission of Fine Arts *Chair of the National Capital Planning Commission *Mayor of the District of Columbia *Commissioner of the Public Building Service of the General Services Administration *United States Secretary of Defense Section 7(a)(1) required memorials to be submitted to NCMAC for siting approval. Section 7(a)(1) required memorials to be submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission for both site and design approval.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 7(a). Section 6(a) of the Commemorative Works Act established the criteria a commemorative work had to meet to be erected in Area I. Either the United States Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the General Services Administration could approve a memorial within Area I if and only if the person, group, or event to be commemorated was of \\"preeminent historical and lasting significance to the Nation.\\"Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 6(a). This determination could be made only after consulting with NCMAC. Even so, the affirmative determination had to be approved by Congress within 150 days, or it was considered disapproved. Section 6(b) of the Commemorative Works Act established the criteria a commemorative work had to meet to be erected in Area II. Section 6(b)(1) governed military commemorative works. It barred memorials for \\"lesser\\" conflicts and those commemorating only a unit of the armed forces of the United States. An individual or the last surviving member of a group to be commemorated had to have died at least 25 years ago for a memorial to be erected. Other commemorative works‚Äîthose not commemorating a war, branch of the armed forces, individual, or group‚Äîwere permissible in Area II only if they were \\"a subject of lasting historical significance.\\"Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 6(b). Section 8(a) barred the District of Columbia or Department of the Interior from issuing a construction permit for a commemorative work unless its site and design had been approved by the secretary or administrator, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the National Capital Planning Commission; unless the memorial planners could prove they had consulted knowledgeable individuals regarding historic preservation and \\"structural soundness and durability\\" about the memorial design; the memorial's builder had design and construction contracts signed; and the memorial's builder had sufficient funds in hand to complete construction.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 8(a). Section 8(b) also required memorial builders to collect an amount equal to 10 percent of the total cost of construction. This amount was to be turned over to the United States Treasury, which would hold them in trust as a perpetual operations and maintenance fund for the memorial.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 8(b). Section 10(b) provided that the authorization for a memorial would expire at the end of five years, unless a construction permit had been issued by the Department of the Interior or the General Services Administration or Congress had expressly enacted legislation authorizing an extension of the deadline.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 10(b). Section 10(e) exempted any memorial authorized before the 99th Congress from the five-year deadline.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 10(e). Section 10(c) of the Act required that title to completed commemorative works be transferred to the Department of the Interior or the General Services Administration upon completion.Commemorative Works Act, Public Law 99-652 (November 14, 1986), Section 10(c). 1991 amendments The 102nd Congress amended the Commemorative Works Act for the first time. Representative Bill Clay (D-Missouri) introduced H.R. 3169 on August 1, 1991. It was referred to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, which approved an amended bill on October 21. The House approved the bill by voice vote the same day. The bill was passed to the Senate, and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It was reported favorably on November 12, and approved by the Senate in a voice vote on November 27. President George H. W. Bush signed it into law on December 11, 1991 (Public Law 102-216). Public Law 102-216 lengthened the term of memorial authorization to seven years from five years.An Act to lengthen from five to seven years the expiration period applicable to legislative authority relating to construction of commemorative works on Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs, Public Law 102-216 (December 11, 1991). 1994 amendments In 1994, Congress enacted amendments to the Commemorative Works Act (Public Law 103-321). On August 6, 1993, Representative Nancy Johnson (R-Connecticut) introduced H.R. 2947. It was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources (the successor committee to the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs), and reported favorably (with amendments) on November 20, 1993. It passed the House on a voice vote on November 23. On October 15, 1993, Senator John Warner (R-Virginia introduced companion legislation (S. 1552) in the Senate. It was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which favorably reported it, with amendments, on April 5, 1994. It passed the Senate on a voice vote on April 12. The House voted 378-to-0 to accept the amendment Senate bill on August 16, 1994. President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law (Public Law 103-321) on August 26. Several memorials were close to losing their congressional authorization in 1994. The backers of these memorials convinced Congress that they were close to raising enough funds to build their commemorative works and obtain final design approval. In Section 1 of the amendments, Congress extended the authorization for the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial, National Peace Garden, and Women in Military Service for America Memorial from seven years to 10 years.To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 1. Section 2(a) of the amendment made minor revisions to the commemorative works encompassed by the CWA. Commemorative works now included plaques and inscriptions, and memorial sponsors had to be either a public agency or a nonprofit organization as defined by the Internal Revenue Code.To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(a). Section 2(b)(2) added the requirement that a major conflict occur at least 10 years ago in order to be authorized in Area I.To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(b)(2). Section 2(c) changed the requirements for meeting the construction deadline. Instead of commencing construction by the deadline, memorial backers now merely had to request a construction permit by the deadline. Memorial backers were also now required to show that they had considered alternative sites and alternative designs for their memorial as well.To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(c). Section 2(e)(2) established a new section of the CWA. It allowed the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to suspend the fundraising for or construction of a commemorative work if the fundraising efforts misrepresented what the funds were being raised for, or if the fundraising effort implied it was an official effort of the United States government. Annual reports regarding fundraising were now required to be submitted either to Interior or GSA.To amend the Commemorative Works Act, and for other purposes, Public Law 103-321 (August 26, 1994), Section 2(e)(2). 2002 amendments On August 21, 2002, Congress enacted a law entitled \\"Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works\\" (Public Law 107‚Äì217). Subtitle II-Public Buildings and Works, Part D-Public Buildings, Grounds, and Parks in the District of Columbia, Sections 8901 to 8909 further amended the Commemorative Works Act. Section 8902(a)(1) included \\"landscape features\\" in the definition of commemorative works. Section 8902(a)(2) expanded the range of organizations which could build memorials to any organization authorized by Congress (regardless of its nonprofit or for- profit status).Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8902(a). Section 8903(b) now barred absolutely works commemorating lesser conflicts or units of the armed forces.Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8903(b). Because the National Capital Memorial Advisory Committee was a creation of the Department of the Interior, it could be dissolved by the department at will, which would leave the CWA without an enforcing body. To rectify this, Section 8904 established a new National Capital Memorial Commission. It had the same membership, chair, and authority as its predecessor.Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8904. Part D also made changes to the procedures by which memorials would be considered. Now it was mandatory under Section 8905(a)(1) for a memorial's backers to consult with the National Capital Memorial Commission (NCMC) regarding alternative sites and designs.Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8905(a)(1). No longer could memorial backers submit their proposed sites and designs directly to the CFA or the NCPC. Now, according to Section 8905(a)(2), only the Department of the Interior or GSA had that authority (which effectively forced memorial backers to coordinate with them to get a submission made).Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8905(a)(2). Congress also tightened the rules for approving a memorial. Section 8905(b) now required that the work be placed only in an area \\"relevant to the subject of the work\\"; that the new memorial not \\"interfere with, or encroach on, an existing commemorative work\\"; protect as much open space as possible and be compatible with existing public use; be constructed of durable materials; and contain landscaping compatible with the local climate.Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8905(b). Section 8906(b)(1) now required that the 10 percent trust fund be turned over to the Treasury before a construction permit could be issued.Codifying Title 40, United States Code‚ÄîPublic Buildings, Property, and Works, Public Law 107-217 (August 21, 2002), Section 8906(b)(1). 2003 amendments Congress enacted the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization (Public Law 108‚Äì126) on November 17, 2003. Unlike subsequent memorial nonprofits, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation (VVMF) continued to operate and solicit funds long after the Vietnam Veterans Memorial had been constructed. The foundation was now self-perpetuating, and had a large staff, lobbyists, and programming. The VVMF began agitating for a museum about the Vietnam War to be constructed near the memorial. The VVMF had raised significant sums of money to construct this museum (which it called a \\"visitor's center\\", so as not to alarm Smithsonian Institution officials), and it had a potent and well-organized grassroots campaign pressuring Congress to approve the plan. Title I of the act authorized construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitors' Center. Title II of the act was titled the Commemorative Works Clarification and Revision Act of 2003 (CWCRA). Title II, Section 202 made a major revision to Area I. Congress now defined within Area I a zone it called the Reserve. The Reserve was designated generally as the National Mall from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, and the cross-axis of the Mall from the White House to the Jefferson Memorial. Section 202 expressly prohibited new commemorative works or visitors' centers within the Reserve.Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 202. A new map, numbered 869/86501 B and dated June 24, 2003, was created to depict the Reserve.Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 203(b). Title II, Section 203(a) now explicitly required NCMC, CFA, NCPC, and other bodies with oversight over memorial siting to seek to locate commemorative works throughout the entire National Capital Area (not just Area I or areas adjacent to it).Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 203(a). Title II, Section 203(c) also changed what works could qualify for placement in Area I and Area II. Works commemorating lesser conflicts were no longer outright barred. Now a commemorative work could memorialize a lesser conflict so long as it did not solely do so.Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 203(c). Title II, Section 203(c)(3) relaxed slightly the standard for issuing a construction permit. Now the Secretary of the Interior or the Administrator of the GSA, in consultation with NCMAC, had the discretion to issue a construction permit if both the NCPC and CFA had issued final (not preliminary) design approval and the foundation had 75 percent (not 100 percent) of the construction funds in hand. Either the Secretary or Administrator also had the authority to extend for up to three years the authorization of a memorial if these conditions were met. Title II, Section 203(f) made it clear, however, that the 10 percent trust fund contribution must also be made (in addition to having 75 percent of construction funds) for a construction permit to issue.Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 203(f). Title II, Section 204 made adjustments to the approval criteria. It barred construction of any museum in either Area I or East Potomac Park, and authorized the CFA and NCPC to develop joint regulations, guidelines, and criteria to carry out the CWA. It also barred recognition of donor contributions on any memorial.Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Authorization, Public Law 108‚Äì126 (November 17, 2003), Title II‚ÄîCommemorative Works, Section 204. 2009 amendments Congress enacted the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (Public Law 111‚Äì11) on March 30, 2009.

He is chiefly known as one of six founders of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in 1873. Early life Frederick George Campbell, born and bred in the Green Mountains, much like co-Founder Clay, was from the small town of Westminister West, Vermont. He prepared for college at the Powers Institute in Bernardston, Massachusetts. His father had an international reputation as a breeder of fine-wooled, American, Merino sheep. \\"Indeed a pen of his sheep took the sweepstake prize at Hamburg, and were thereupon sold to a Continental breeder for $5,000;\\" a great sum of money at the time. (p. 18) Campbell was exceedingly practical in his philosophy of life, and would drolly say of some of his college work, \\"Now that isn't going to be of any use to me.\\" While not like Clay, bubblingly original and creative in his thinking powers, he seems still to have been a dynamic force in putting a presented idea into actual operation. (p. 18) Collegiate activities Like many of his fellow Founders, Campbell participated in an array of collegiate activities. While at Aggie he was a member of the Washington Irving Literary Society, a popular pastime among the undergraduates. Campbell was a member of the Gymnastic Association, and like others of the Fraternity's Founders held the military rank of lieutenant in the College's Battalion. In 1875, he graduated fifth among all graduating students, with only fellow Phi Sigs ahead of him. His peers honored Campbell by election as vice-president and treasurer of his class. But among all these activities and honors, it was his role as a Founder of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity in his Sophomore year by which he is best remembered today. Rand's History summarizes that Campbell's ability to assess and deliver a pragmatic outcome of a bare idea was his genius, and his contribution to the Order. Frederick George Campbell, at 50 years of age. Later years True to his pragmatism, Campbell soon returned to Vermont and the family farm. He married Miss Emma L. Harlow Oct. 15, 1875, the year of his graduation. They couple had seven children, all born in Westminster West: * Harry Harlow, b. May 23, 1876. * Frank Walter, b. Sept. 26, 1877. * Helen Louise, b.

Campbell was present for its dedication. Continued fraternal activity Though busy with his farm and a growing family, Campbell remained in touch with the fellows back at Amherst: Rand's History notes that Campbell donated a supply of maple sugar at the occasion of the Order's move from its original rooms to a larger space in the Spring of 1878. He was occasionally present at reunions and Grand Chapter meetings held in the Boston area, and was a regular at Amherst. While not an alumnus officer, he remained admired, as were all the Founders. When younger brethren would ply them for interviews, the Founders were quick to praise each other's contribution with equanimity, acknowledging that each provided an important element to the whole. Campbell continued to correspond regularly with Grand Chapter and Alpha chapter leaders all his life., page 101. With Founder Brooks, Campbell made a pilgrimage to Amherst on May 12, 1923 for the dedication of \\"The Shrine,\\" a plaque honoring the fraternity that was dedicated on the wall of Old North, the dormitory where the now thriving Order had been founded 50 years prior.

The Piguet fashion house ran from 1933 to 1951; since then, the brand Robert Piguet has been associated exclusively with fragrances. Early life and education Piguet was born in Yverdon-les-Bains in Switzerland, in 1898, according to the Swiss Fashion Museum, the Mus√©e suisse de la Mode, which holds his archives, although many other sources give an alternative birth year of 1901. In Paris Couturiers and Milliners, published in 1949, Piguet is said to have been 17 in 1918. Death Piguet died at Lausanne, Switzerland, on 22 February 1953. Career The young Piguet originally trained to be a banker, like his father, but preferred fashion design, much to his father's disapproval. In late 1918, just after the end of World War I, he decided to go to Paris to pursue his vocation. Initially, Piguet began working with Paul Poiret, before being poached by the Paris branch of Redfern. In 1932, an American author writing on Paris fashion commented that the American cartoonist 'would probably select Robert Piguet, the designer at Redfern's, as the ideal Parisian dressmaker.' In 1933, Piguet launched his own fashion house. Eleanor Lambert described him as known for '\\"thin suits\\" and tasteful day dresses,' whilst Vogue declared him the 'master of the little wool dress'. He is perhaps best known for giving Christian Dior his big break in 1937, allowing him to design for three collections. Dior later said: 'Robert Piguet taught me the virtues of simplicity through which true elegance must come.' One of Dior's designs for Piguet, a day dress called 'Cafe Anglais' with a short and full skirt was particularly well received. While at Piguet, Dior worked alongside Pierre Balmain, and was succeeded by Marc Bohan as house designer. In addition to Dior, Bohan and Balmain, other designers who had an early start with Piguet included James Galanos and Hubert de Givenchy. Piguet's archive, consisting of 3,000 original designs, photographs and documents, is held by the Mus√©e suisse de la Mode, in his birthplace, Yverdon- les-Bains. Perfumes In collaboration with Germaine Cellier, Robert Piguet launched his first perfume Bandit (created 1942) in the USA in 1944, with a dramatic presentation featuring models with guns and knives, one of whom is said to have smashed a bottle of the fragrance on the floor. His most successful fragrance was Fracas (1948), also co-developed with Cellier - an updated version of which was inducted into the FiFi Awards's Hall of Fame in 2006. Other fragrances developed under Piguet's supervision were Visa (1945) and Baghari (1950). Following Piguet's death, fragrances such as Cravache (1963) and Futur (1960s) continued to be developed under his name, although 'Robert Piguet' gradually fell from public awareness until being bought by the American company Fashion Fragrances & Cosmetics Ltd in 1993.Williams, Tessa (2013).

The score, published in 1933, is dedicated to the memory of the violinist Franz Kneisel. It is one of the composer's most popular and at the same time most critically respected works. History Enescu and Alfred Cortot in 1930 The Third Violin Sonata was written in a span of about four months in 1926 at a time when Enescu was also occupied with the late stages of work on the opera ≈ídipe. The sonata was first performed in Oradea, in January 1927 by the composer and the pianist Nicolae Caravia, who repeated it shortly afterward in Bucharest. Enescu and Caravia also gave the Paris premiere in March 1927, in the Salle Gaveau. A particularly notable early performance took place in Paris in June 1930, when the composer was partnered by Alfred Cortot. Enescu's pupil Yehudi Menuhin made a recording in 1936 with his sister Hephzibah Menuhin on piano, and the composer himself recorded the work twice as a violinist, in 1943 with Dinu Lipatti and again a few years later with C√©liny Chaillez- Richez. A performance took place in May 1946 with Yehudi Menuhin playing the violin part, accompanied on the piano by the composer . The sonata prompted enthusiasm immediately at the time of its premiere, and has ever since been the composition by Enescu that has received the greatest amount of attention in the musicological and critical literature, with the possible exception of his opera, ≈ídipe. It has also become the most popular of Enescu's works after the two Romanian Rhapsodies . Analysis Without ever quoting actual folk tunes, the material possesses the authenticity of a sort of \\"super folklore\\". The violin is cast in the role of a gypsy fiddle, and the writing for the piano imitates the cimbalom and kobza . The sonata is divided into three movements: #Moderato malinconico #Andante sostenuto e misterioso #Allegro con brio, ma non troppo mosso The first movement is in a loose sonata-allegro form, beginning with a suave and nostalgic first thematic group presented in continuous and supple lines in the piano and more hesitantly in the violin. When this material returns in the recapitulation it will be transformed into a kind of \\"horƒÉ bƒÉtr√ÆneascƒÉ\\" (old men's dance). The second thematic group brings a contrasting atmosphere of sobriety and intensified differentiation of colour, a characteristic that will return for further development in the second movement . The development is confined almost entirely to material from the first thematic group, but after the recapitulation there is an extended coda that brings together motivic fragments from both groups. The transformation of the material from the lyrical, songlike style of the exposition and development into the persistent dance rhythms of the recapitulation bestows upon the movement the overall impression of a two-part rhapsody in the traditional lass√∫‚Äìfriss pattern . The second movement can be described as a song form in three parts: a long opening section filled with introspection and poetic facets, where the violin plays almost entirely in harmonics, followed by a contrasting central section in folk style, and a return of the opening material with a concluding, gentle coda (; ). The finale is in rondo form using a refrain whose melody is reminiscent of a bear dance from northern Moldavia. Despite the sectional form, the thematic material is subjected to continuous variation‚Äîa process made particularly clear in the C section, which is structured as a miniature theme and variations. This procedure results in an effect described as Enescu's \\"rhapsodic style\\" . Discography *George Enescu: Sonata No. 3 for Violin and Piano in A minor, Op. 25\\\\.

Rauland's healthcare product, Responder is an intelligent nurse call solution designed for direct patient-to-staff communication, intelligent call routing, and real-time reporting of patient care. Rauland's education product, Telecenter, is a critical communications solution designed to assist school communications involving emergencies, scheduling and events, and everyday messaging. History Rauland Amplicall Model 3412 intercom Rauland was founded in 1922 by inventor E. Norman Rauland. In 1924, he became a pioneer in the radio broadcast industry by launching his own, Chicago-based radio station, WENR. Throughout the Great Depression, Rauland manufactured power amplifiers and equipment for public address systems. During this time, the Rauland Company won government contracts to produce radio and communication systems for the military. In 1941, Norm Rauland and George Borg entered a partnership, changing the history of the company. The Rauland Corporation acquired the Webster-Chicago Corporation, a leader in school communications, and Rauland became established as the dominant supplier of internal school communications systems. In 1948, Norm Rauland and George Borg started a new company, Rauland-Borg Corporation, continuing the sound and communications business. In the early 1960s, after recognizing the need to keep school instructors and staff in touch with each other, Rauland-Borg introduced the first generation of Telecenter products in 1968. Telecenter was the first-ever commercial application of touch-tone technology. In 1979, after the acquisition of the Picker-Briggs Company, the manufacturer of the Responder health care communications systems, Rauland-Borg established itself as a leader in nurse call communications. In 2017, Rauland was acquired and became a division of AMETEK Inc., a global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices. Today, Rauland has two distinct communication system product lines: Responder, designed for the healthcare industry and Telecenter systems which serve the educational market.

The name also marks the historic Tosa Maidan route into the Kashmir Valley from the Poonch Valley. In fact, the original name of Tosa Maidan appears to have been \\"Tosa Marg\\".: \\"In that vale resembling Paradise, there are besides several summer retreats such as no other region can boast of. One is called the Godi Marg, another the Tosa Marg; and the profusion of flowers and plants in both those places is so great that you can pluck at least 100 different kinds of blossoms off a single parterre.\\" Mahmud of Ghazni and the Sikh monarch Ranjit Singh attempted to invade the Kashmir Valley via this route.  The meadow  Bounded by dense forests, the Tosa Maidan meadow is situated about 25 km from Khag at the foot of the Pir Panjal range. After crossing the upper mountain reaches of Drang, Zakhora and other small villages, one reaches the pasture of Tosa Maidan. Tosa Maidan is the largest pasture in its surrounding areas, 3 miles in length and 1.5 miles in width. Sky-touching deodars fence this pasture presenting a view of a green carpet in summer. During the summer, the camps of the Gujjar community and shepherds with their grazing sheep in the pastures present a riveting picture. Also, the fragrance of wild flowers refreshes the whole environment.  The route  According to M. A. Stein, the Tosa Maidan route starts from the Drang village (going out from the Kashmir valley). After crossing the Tosa Maidain meadow, it ascends gently to an elevation of 13,000 ft at the top of Pir Panjal range. \\"The ascent is so gradual and easy that... the construciton of cart-roud would so far meet with little difficulty.\\" There are several streams originating at the top of the range at this locale, all of which join to form the Sukhnag river. At the top of the Pir Panjal range, there are a number of passes leading to the Poonch Valley. The most often used pass is called Chinamarg Gali, once known as the Tosa Maidan pass, near the Danam Sar lake. Chinamarg and Danam Sar, mapcarta.com It provides a steep descent into the Loran Valley, passing by the village of Sultanpathri. At the southwest is another pass called Pathri ki Gali, near the Pam Sar lake (which is also the source of the main stream feeding the Sukhnag river).Pathri ki Gali and Pam Sar, mapcarta.com This provides a gentler descent into another branch of the Loran Valley, which meets up with the first route near the village of Loran. Both the branches of Loran streams feed the Mandi River. To the north of Chinamrag Gali is another pass Jamianwali Gali, which descends into the Gagri Valley. This pass provides a longer route to Poonch.  History  The Tosa Maidan route into the Kashmir Valley was of high importance during the Lohara dynasty of Srinagar (1003‚Äì1320 CE), as is evident from its repeated mention in the last two Books of Kalhana's Rajatarangini. The ruling house of the Lohara state, based in the Loran valley, took over the reigns of Kashmir after the death of its king Kshemagupta, who had married a Lohara princess. Samgramaraja was the first full-fledged ruler of the dynasty. During his rule, Mahmud of Ghazni attempted to invade Kashmir via the Tosa Maidan route, once in 1003 and another time in 1021. In both the instances, he was blocked by the Lohara fort (Loharkot) that guarded the route. Mahmud was unable to conquer the fort itself. In the second instance, he also suffered a disruption of communications due to a heavy snowfall. Historian Mohibbul Hasan states that this was the first serious reverse suffered by Mahmud in India. M. A. Stein states that, even before the time of Lohara dynasty, the route must have been quite important. It provided the shortest route between Srinagar and Poonch as well as access to the western Punjab areas between the Jhelum and Indus rivers, which were under the control of Kashmir until medieval times. The route was also the \\"easiest and safest route in that direction\\", since it provided easy ascent from the Kashir Valley and was well-guarded by the Loharkot fort. Al Beruni stated that brisk trade was carried out along this route. The importance of the route declined after the Mughal rule, during which the Pir Panjal Pass was developed as an Imperial Road, and the Afghan Durrani rule, during which the Jhelum Valley cart-road was developed. Even so, Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire attempted two invasion Kashmir via the Tosa Maidan route in 1814 and 1819. The first time, his army was divided into two forces, one attacking the Pir Panjal Pass and the other the Tosa Maidan meadow. At the meadow, Ranjit Singh was blocked by the Durrani defences. He also suffered difficulty of maintaining supplies and was forced to retreat. Later in 1819, all the Sikh forces were concentrated on Tosa Maidan and conquered the Durrani forces.* = Partition and war = Operation Easy, Poonch link-up Soon after the Partition of India, the Muslims of the western tehsils of Poonch (especially the Bagh and Sudhnoti tehsils) rebelled against the Hindu Maharaja of the princely state Jammu and Kashmir. On 22 October 1947, raiders from Pakistan joined the rebels, leading to the First Kashmir War. The State Forces garrison at Poonch is said to have been besieged. The majority of the Tosa Maidan route up to the Pir Panjal range is likely to have come under the control of the rebels. After India sent its armed forces to defend the state following the Maharaja's accession, the Poonch garrison was maintained by air dropping supplies. Towards the end of 1948, the Indian Army's Operation Easy dispatched forces from Rajouri and Uri to link up at Poonch and establish a line of defence along Uri‚ÄìPoonch-Nowshera line. After this was accomplished, the State Forces from the garrison fanned out in the area east of the line, clearing it of hostile forces. The Tosa Maidan route was thus secured.: \\"As a result of the link-up, the Indian Army had secured Poonch and Mandi and the surrounding areas, yet many dangerous pockets remained under enemy occupation. Two such pockets were in the valleys of Gagrian and Loran.... The Gorkhas secured both Gagrian and Loran. New posts were established at Kath Panjal, a defile on the track towards Haji Pir, and at Khet.\\" = Post-Partition history = In 1964, the Tosa Maidan meadow was leased to the Indian Army on a 50-year lease for use as an artillery firing range. Before the lease came up for renewal on 18 April 2014, the local residents protested against an extension of the lease. Consequently, the lease was terminated, and the Tosa Maidan meadow has been open to visitors since 30 May 2016.

History\\" retrieved April 20, 2014 and in 1941, he founded the Sid Tool Company in Little Italy, Manhattan with $1,000 of his own money and $3,000 borrowed from his mother. Sid Tool sold cutting tools to New York City machine shops. After serving in the Army Air Force during World War II leaving the business first, in the hands of his brother (until he too was drafted) and then his sister while he was gone. He returned to a company with $36,000 in annual sales where he soon landed exclusive contracts with Grumman Corporation and Republic Aircraft. In 1955, he moved the company to Plainview, New York, closer to his home in Great Neck, New York. Sensing that he was overly reliant on the two aerospace companies (they were 90% of sales in the 1960s), he launched a catalog business to diversify his customer base. His colorful catalog (known as \\"The Big Book\\") combined with an expansive portfolio of lower cost imported tools purchased at a discount (Sid Tools was the first company in the industry to widely import foreign-manufactured tools) propelled catalog sales which soon exceeded the company's regular sales. After an inventory problem where he ran out of stock of a critical item, Jacobson invested heavily in computerized inventory management and order processing, the first to do so in the industry. In 1970, Sid Tool purchased the cutting tool marketer, Manhattan Supply Company and changed the name of the company to MSC Industrial Direct, using the initials of Manhattan Supply. In 1978, MSC became one of the first distributors to launch a fully integrated Quality Assurance Department. In 1976, his son Mitchell, a lawyer, joined the company and was tasked with seeking out the best practices at other industrial suppliers to implement at MSC. In 1982, Mitchell replaced his father as president of the company. The company went public in 1995.New York Times: \\"The Legacies They Left\\" By MARCELLE S.

After working as an assistant to well-known photographers Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams in his youth, he went on to a long career as a photographer and filmmaker. Early life Partridge was born in San Francisco in 1917. He had a twin brother named Padraic. His parents were etcher Roi Partridge and photographer Imogen Cunningham. He grew up in a household where he was constantly exposed to the influence of several great California artists of the early 20th century. For example, at the age of four, he spent time staying at the home of photographer Dorothea Lange and her husband, painter Maynard Dixon. Lange was embarrassed that Dixon taught Partridge an \\"obscene verse\\", and then encouraged him to recite it in front of guests. Partridge became so close to Lange that their relationship was often compared to a son's relationship with his mother. Assistant to Dorothea Lange and Ansel Adams A 1935 photo by Partridge of Dorothea Lange Partridge began assisting his mother in her darkroom when he was five years old. At the age of 16, he became photographic assistant to Dorothea Lange, when she got a job taking pictures documenting rural poverty for the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency of the U.S. government. Lange paid Partridge one dollar a day plus expenses to be her driver and darkroom assistant, and he often spent the night outdoors in a sleeping bag while she slept in a bed in a motel. Lange was paid four dollars a day. From 1937 to 1939, he worked as an assistant to Ansel Adams in Yosemite National Park. He operated Adams' new automated darkroom in Yosemite Village, which produced photographic prints of Adams' work for sale to tourists. In July, 1937, Edward Weston, who had received a one-year Guggenheim Fellowship to photograph the American West, arrived in Yosemite. Adams had organized an excursion to the High Sierra, hiring three mules at Red's Meadow to take the party to the Minarets and Devils Postpile National Monument. Partridge accompanied and assisted the party. Other members of the group included Charis Wilson (later Weston's wife), climber David Brower (later executive director of the Sierra Club) and another climber, Morgan Harris. After a week of taking photos and battling mosquitoes, the group returned to Yosemite Valley late at night on July 27. As they were eating a dinner of roast chicken, they learned that Adams' new darkroom in an adjacent building was on fire. Partridge and others battled the flames until the fire was extinguished. Although thousands of negatives were lost, many masterpieces were saved. The fire had been caused by negligence by a photo technician sent by the Zeiss camera company. Career as a photographer A 1940 photo by Rondal Partridge of a migrant farmworker family riding a freight train in Roseville, California In 1940, he got a job with a New Deal agency called the National Youth Administration, documenting the problems faced by young people in the final years of the Great Depression. In contrast to Adams, whose work focused on the beauty of the natural landscape, Partridge has documented the human built infrastructure of Yosemite, as well as changes to the built environment of the San Francisco Bay Area. An example of such work is his mid 1960s photograph Pave It and Paint It Green. The photo shows iconic Yosemite peak Half Dome in the background, while the foreground consists of a parking lot filled with cars. In the photo, \\"the distinction between city and wilderness has disappeared\\". Partridge also made a documentary film of the same name, which was shown on television. Adams, who did not appreciate irony or social commentary in photography, disapproved of Partridge's 1960s work in Yosemite, although he later called Partridge a \\"fine photographer\\" in his autobiography. Partridge has taken portraits of ordinary working people, as well as many notable people including Odetta, Ruth Asawa, Judy Dater, John Carl Warnecke, Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams and Diego Rivera as well as his mother, Imogen Cunningham. Partridge's photo Pave It and Paint It Green was part of an exhibition on the art of Yosemite which appeared at the Autry National Center, the Oakland Museum of California, the Nevada Museum of Art and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art from 2006 to 2008. 21st Editions published a platinum portfolio of his work in 2012, The Symmetry of Endeavor, which includes 12 prints plus a vintage print from his personal archive.http://www.21steditions.com/titles/#/the-symmetry-of- endeavor/ Partridge died on June 19, 2015 at the age of 97.Woo, Elaine: Rondal Partridge dies at 97; photographer known for irreverence.

Hornblum is an author, journalist and a former criminal justice official and political organizer based in Philadelphia, USA. He has written seven non-fiction books running the gamut from organized crime and Soviet espionage to medical ethics and sports. His first book, Acres of Skin, published in 1998, detailed unethical human medical experiments at Holmesburg Prison. The publication of Acres of Skin attracted considerable international media interest. Subsequently, Hornblum wrote Sentenced to Science, a book about the experience of an African American inmate in Holmesburg prison. Hornblum's third book on medical ethics, Against Their Will, co-authored with Judith Newman and Gregory Dober was released in 2013. Hornblum‚Äôs latest book publication is American Colossus: Big Bill Tilden and the Creation of Modern Tennis (University of Nebraska Press, Spring, 2018).  Education  Hornblum graduated Penn State University and earned graduate degrees from Villanova and Temple Universities  Career  After completing his master's degree from Villanova University, Hornblum went to Holmesburg prison to direct an adult literacy program in 1971. There, he noticed scores of inmates with arms covered in gauze pads and adhesive tape. He later learned that medical experiments had been conducted on the inmates for the last 20 years. Hornblum spent 10 years as a literacy instructor and sat on the board of the Pennsylvania Prison Society. He was appointed to the Philadelphia Board of Prison Trustees in 1986. While serving as a prison trustee, he actively participated in a proposal to allow prisoners the right to have condoms. However, the proposal was turned down. Hornblum also served as the executive director of the Americans for Democratic Action. As executive director of Americans for Democratic Action, Hornblum led or participated in a number of issue and electoral campaigns that ran the gamut from US Senate and City Council races to reproductive rights and right-to-know environmental campaigns. Hornblum was appointed to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission in 1988. Designed to investigate organized crime and public corruption in the commonwealth, Hornblum was a member when the Commission investigated the criminal connections of Pa. Attorney General Ernie Preate. That investigation eventually led to Preate's conviction and imprisonment. In 1990, he was appointed chief of staff of the Philadelphia Sheriff's Office. Hornblum directed a number of efforts to improve and upgrade the office such as initiating a campaign to improve the dire conditions of the 7th floor cell room in City Hall. He resigned from the Sheriff's Office in 1994 to research and write a book about the history of the Holmesburg medical experiments. The book was released under the title Acres of Skin in 1998. He has also been lecturer of history and Urban Studies at Temple University. Hornblum has lectured on his research and books at the British Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and numerous universities, including Columbia, Brown, Princeton, Penn State, and St. Joseph's. Hornblum has continued to write and lecture on prison research issues. He has illuminated the University of Pennsylvania continues to honor Dr Kligman with professorships and lectureships despite his use of institutionalized children and prisoners as test subjects.  Books  = Acres of Skin= In 1998, Hornblum published a book titled Acres of Skin: Human Experiments at Holmesburg Prison. The book documents clinical non- therapeutic medical experiments on prison inmates at Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia from 1951 to 1974, conducted under the direction of dermatologist Albert Kligman. These abuses terminated with the scandal surrounding the Tuskegee syphilis experiment and the mind control experiments of the CIA. Hornblum is most critical of Kligman, who ran the experiments for two decades. Hornblum, along with George Holmes, also produced a documentary film about the Holmesburg Medical Research Program entitled, Acres of Skin ‚Äì The Documentary. = Confessions of a Second Story Man = Confessions of a Second Story Man: Junior Kripplebauer and the K&A; Gang is the second book by Hornblum. The book tells the story of the K&A; Gang, an Irish crime group that was in existence from the early 1950s to the late 1970s in Philadelphia. = Sentenced to Science = Sentenced to Science: One Black Man's Story of Imprisonment in America was released in 2007. It is a personal narrative of Edward (Yusef) Anthony's time at Holmesburg. The book discusses the experiments conducted on Anthony and how the experiments affected his life afterwards. = The Invisible Harry Gold = In 2011, Hornblum released The Invisible Harry Gold: The Man Who Gave the Soviets the Atom Bomb, a book about the life of Harry Gold, an American spy in the Soviet underground. In the mid-1940s, Gold took atomic secrets from Klaus Fuchs and gave them to the Soviet Union. Hornblum, in his book, addresses the attacks made upon Gold‚Äôs character by Rosenberg supporters over the years. Hornblum spent eight years researching and writing the book and interviewed over 50 people as well as obtained recordings of jail house interviews with Gold conducted by his legal team. The book was published by the Yale University Press and received positive reviews from the critics. = Against Their Will= While researching Acres of Skin about medical experiments on inmates in Holmesburg Prison, Hornblum came across documentation about similar experiments conducted on children and infants. He started researching about such experiments in 2008. In 2013, he released Against Their Will: The Secret History of Medical Experimentation on Children in Cold War America co-authored with Judith Newman and Gregory Dober. The book provides multiple examples of medical experiments performed on developmentally delayed and physically disabled children at multiple institutions across the US. It was published by Palgrave Macmillan. = American Colossus= Bill Tilden was one of America's greatest athletes during the \\"Golden Age of Sports.\\" The first American-born player to win the Wimbledon title and the world's most dominant tennis player during the first half of the 20th century, Tilden was also a prolific author - writing over two dozen fiction and non- fiction books, and hundreds of newspaper articles - as well as a performer on stage and screen. Despite his fame and many achievements, however, he was convicted late in life on a morals charge, served time in prison, and his celebrity and lifestyle much reduced. = The Klondike Bake Oven Deaths = Hornblum¬¥s latest book concerns the gruesome murder of prison inmates who took part in a prison strike in Philadelphia in 1938. He is currently writing a screenplay detailing the cooking alive of prison strike supporters.

In addition to writing 18 books with Steven Naifeh, Smith was an accomplished musician, historic preservationist, art collector, philanthropist, attorney, and businessman who founded several companies including Best Lawyers, which spawned an entire industry of professional rankings. His brain tumor, which was diagnosed in 1975, led to 13 brain surgeries as well as radiation and nuclear medicine treatments and experimental chemotherapeutic regimens. His search for cutting-edge medical care was profiled on CBS's 60 Minutes and recounted in his book Making Miracles Happen. Jackson Pollock: An American Saga was published in 1990, winning the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. The Philadelphia Inquirer called the book \\"Brilliant and definitive ‚Ä¶ so absorbing in its narrative drive and so exhaustively detailed that it makes everything that came before seem like trial balloons.\\" Van Gogh: The Life, which Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called \\"magisterial,\\" was published in 2011 with a companion website hosting over 6,000 pages of notes. The book stirred global controversy by debunking the widely accepted theory that Van Gogh committed suicide and arguing instead that village bullies shot him. \\"As a tale of ambition, hard-fought fleeting triumphs and dark despair,\\" said the San Francisco Gate, \\"it has the dramatic pull of a gripping nineteenth-century novel. ‚Ä¶ [The] biography enriches the eye. Its insight and vast information vault readers into the work of Van Gogh and the artists of his time. It deepens the experience of looking at art.\\" \\"A tour de force,\\" said the Los Angeles Times, a \\"sweepingly authoritative, astonishingly textured book.\\" Personal life Smith was born in Ithaca, New York on October 4, 1951, and was raised in Columbus, Ohio, where he attended the Columbus Academy. \\"Walking to school beginning at an early age,\\" Naifeh said, \\"he would think of a sentence. Then, talking out loud, as he did for the rest of his life, he would try different ways to articulate the same thought, clarifying the idea and giving the words more character and force. It was the beginning of a lifelong love of and gift for words.\\" \\"Also at age eight, Smith began dictating short novels into a Dictaphone his father used in business, which his mother transcribed. 'They were only 25 or 30 pages long,' Smith said, 'and the work of a child. But I was so thrilled that my mother typed them. There was my name at the top of the first page, 'By Gregory White Smith.'\\" \\"As editor of his high school newspaper, he once wrote an editorial about the French experience in Vietnam and its lessons for the United States. When the headmaster burned all of the copies of the paper, Smith called on the headmaster to resign. 'Greg was already showing his fiercely combative spirit,' Naifeh said, 'the same spirit that would get him through a lifelong battle against a terrible disease and unending pain.'\\" He graduated from Colby College in 1973, spent a year studying music in Europe on a Watson Fellowship, and then enrolled at the Harvard Law School. He graduated from the Law School in 1977, and received a master's degree in education, also from Harvard, in 1978. Smith was a singer and choral conductor. He founded the Colby Eight in 1972 and served as assistant conductor of the Harvard Glee Club, where he helped prepare choruses for such conductors as Leonard Bernstein, Seiji Ozawa, and Mstislav Rostropovich, from 1974 to 1979. Smith received honorary doctorates from the University of South Carolina Aiken in 1998, the Juilliard School in 2012, and Colby College in 2013. In 1989, along with his partner Naifeh, he purchased the Joye Cottage in Aiken, South Carolina. Together, they restored the historic Whitney-Vanderbilt house, a creation of both Stanford White and Carr√®re and Hastings. The story of that renovation is told in their book, On a Street Called Easy, In a Cottage Called Joye, which The New York Times called \\"wry and gentle ‚Ä¶ house-and-garden renovations gone delectably awry.\\" They are leaving the house to be a residence for artists in music, drama, and dance. In 2009, with Sandra Field, Smith co-founded the Juilliard in Aiken Festival, a performing arts festival that brings dozens of artists to Aiken each year for performances and has provided educational outreach to more than 16,000 students in an area covering parts of Georgia and South Carolina. The year Smith died, the Festival culminated in an early-music performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion that was presented not only in Aiken but in Spivey Hall in Atlanta and Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center. James R. Oestreich wrote in The New York Times that the performance contained \\"flashes of brilliance, all right. But what made the event so deeply satisfying was mainly the consistent excellence of all its parts.\\" In 1975, a few months after beginning Harvard Law School, Smith began experiencing unexplained skeletal pain. After six months of clinical investigation, he was diagnosed with a hemangiopericytoma, a tumor so rare it landed him on the cover of the New England Journal of Medicine. Uncertain that he could survive the disease ‚Äì in 1987, he was given three months to live ‚Äì Smith, together with Naifeh, spent the rest of his life finding doctors around the world who could perform operations or improvise treatments to keep him alive long enough for the next lifesaving treatment to emerge. Smith's survival was featured on a segment of CBS's 60 Minutes in 1997. He was asked by Morley Safer, \\"Everyone must ask the question when given what appears to be a death sentence, 'Why me?'\\" Smith answered, \\"I've been very, very lucky in my life. I had a great family ‚Äì have a great family. I have Steve. I've been endowed with some talents. I've had a chance to write a book that I'm very proud of. I have great friends. And never once in all those things, I never once said, 'Why?' So how can I demand from the universe some sort of rationale for the bad that I've never demanded for the good?\\" Smith married Steven Naifeh, his co-author and partner of 40 years, in 2011. \\"It took enormous grit and determination to stage this heroic ongoing battle against his brain tumor,\\" Naifeh said to the Aiken Standard. \\"Yet, it never robbed him of his passion for life. Or his sweetness. He was so unassuming about his intellectual gifts, so guileless, that he had an extraordinary capacity to help people understand how special they were in their own ways.\\" Career Smith worked as an associate attorney at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster and as an editor at the Free Press, where he published the Encyclopedia of Crime and Justice in 1983. He was the author, all with Naifeh, of many books including five New York Times bestsellers. He published Jackson Pollock: An American Saga in 1990, which won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and was also a finalist for the National Book Award. Interview Magazine said of the book, \\"For once, with this intense, engrossing, and indeed brilliant work, we have a biography that justifies its length. Seldom have the history of an artist, the development of his imagination, and the fevers of his soul been more grandly yet intimately described.\\" The book was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film by Ed Harris in 2000, Pollock (film). Harris said the biography was \\"the bible for the project and remained so until filming was completed.\\" The biography also served as an inspiration for John Updike's Seek My Face. \\"It would be in vain,\\" Updike wrote, \\"to deny that a large number of details come from the admirable, exhaustive 'Jackson Pollock: An American Saga.'\\" Smith also wrote Van Gogh: The Life, which was called \\"the definitive work for decades to come\\" by Leo Jansen of the Van Gogh Museum, in 2011. Time Magazine wrote: \\"Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, whose 1989 biography of Jackson Pollock won the Pulitzer Prize, have written this generation's definitive portrait of the great Dutch post-Impressionist. ‚Ä¶ Their most important achievement is to produce a reckoning with van Gogh's occasional 'madness' that doesn't lose sight of the lucidity and intelligence ‚Äì the profound sanity ‚Äì of his art.\\" The Boston Globe wrote: \\"Now, at last, with 'Van Gogh: The Life' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, we have what could very well be the definitive biography ‚Ä¶ And how pleased we should be that Naifeh and Smith have rendered so exquisitely and respectfully van Gogh's short, intense, and wholly interesting life.\\" In addition to English, Van Gogh: The Life has been published in Dutch, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese and is being translated into Italian, Polish, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. Smith also wrote several how-to books to fund the writing of Pollock, including (with Michael Morgenstern), the best-seller How to Make Love to a Woman, which sold several million copies in 29 languages. He wrote several true crime books, including the bestseller The Mormon Murders in 1988 and Final Justice in 1993. The latter was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Fact Crime. Smith's one book of humor, detailing the renovation of Joye Cottage, was well-received: \\"Page after belly-ticking page,\\" wrote The Washington Post. \\"Numerous adventures bordering on slapstick. ‚Ä¶ A delightful read.\\" Smith also wrote two television series, one for PBS on the history of the Supreme Court with Archibald Cox and one for NBC on human behavior with Phil Donahue. Together with Naifeh, Smith founded the legal publishing company Best Lawyers in 1981, which published The Best Lawyers in America, a peer- review list, in 1983. That list went on to become Best Lawyers¬Æ, a global network linking lawyers and clients. In 2013, Best Lawyers ranked 74,965 lawyers representing 18,034 law firms in 75 countries. In 2009, the company partnered with U.S. News to produce rankings of law firms and in 2014 it gave out 61,138 rankings to 11,681 law firms in 120 practice areas. The Best Lawyers list is widely respected in the legal profession. Kevin Maroney, Associate General Counsel of United Healthcare, has said, \\"I always review Best Lawyers and rely on its recommendations.\\" Bernd-Peter Bier, Senior Vice President of the Tax Division at Bayer AG, has said, \\"I have used Best Lawyers to locate lawyers in an area of law that I do not have retained counsel. I find it to be a great resource.\\" Kevin R. Hackett, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of Rockefeller Group International, has said, \\"Best Lawyers is the gold standard in selecting a lawyer.\\" In 1997, Smith told his story, as well as those of other patients conquering critical illnesses, in the book Making Miracles Happen, which Phil Donahue called \\"an inspiring gift to all of us who remain one cell away from the pathologies that would kill us ‚Ä¶ Greg Smith's relentless and successful effort to save his own life is a medical story for the twenty-first century.\\" With Naifeh, he also founded Best Doctors, a company dedicated to helping others with undiagnosed or seemingly untreatable medical illnesses find the best medicine anywhere in the world. Although they sold the company in 2000, it continues to serve more than 30 million members worldwide. Illness and death Smith died of a brain tumor in 2014 at the age of 62. His brain tumor, which was diagnosed in 1975, led to 13 brain surgeries as well as radiation and nuclear medicine treatments and experimental chemotherapeutic regimens. His search for cutting-edge medical care was profiled on CBS's 60 Minutes and recounted in his book Making Miracles Happen.

Aside of portraying the titular protagonist in the film, Lau also briefly reprises his role as \\"Lee Rock\\", the real life-inspired protagonist from the film series of the same name. Plot Triad leader Chiu (Ray Lui) calls up a meeting hoping to find someone willing to adopt an abandoned male infant he picked up in Temple Street. During the meeting, nobody was able to stop the infant from crying until it was passed to a servant's arms. He is Tong Chau- sui (Ng Man-tat), who is chosen as the adoptive father of the infant. Because there were twelve people in the meeting and everyone were the infant's godparents, Chiu names the infant Tong Sap-yee (lit. \\"Tong Twelve\\"), whom everyone calls as \\"Prince Twelve\\". On the surface, Prince Twelve (Andy Lau) seems like a favored person, but down his heart, he is lonelier than everyone else. His adoptive father, Chau-sui, is a worker of a mahjong house in Temple Street while his adoptive mother, Phoenix (Deanie Ip), is an ex-prostitute who claims to have abandoned his son in Temple Street on the same day Twelve was abandoned, and thus, treats Prince Twelve as her biological son. The renowned Prince Twelve has a rival named Lap Ling (Chin Ho), who is the leader of the Kwoon Chung Gang and a person more terrible than a devil.

He joined the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army in 1871, and rose up from the ranks, starting with corporal in June 1873. He attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in March 1874 and was commissioned as an ensign with the Tokyo Garrison. He was a participant of the Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1874) and promoted to second lieutenant. He fought against his fellow Satsuma clansmen in the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 and was promoted to lieutenant in military engineering in the IJA 1st Infantry Brigade. In March 1879, he was assigned to the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff and promoted to captain in April 1881. He subsequently served in numerous staff positions, including on the Imperial Guard and as vice-commandant of the Army Staff College. He served in combat during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and was promoted to major general in September 1897.

This method is an alternative formulation of the technology behind the MoM and is applicable to much larger structures like radar cross-section (RCS) analysis, antenna integration on large structures, reflector antenna design, finite size antenna arrays, etc., making full-wave current-based solutions of such structures a possibility.  Method  The MLFMM is based on the Method of Moments (MoM), but reduces the memory complexity from N2 to NlogN, and the solving complexity from N3 to NiterNlogN, where N represents the number of unknowns and Niter the number of iterations in the solver. This method subdivides the Boundary Element mesh into different clusters and if two clusters are in each other's far field, all calculations that would have to be made for every pair of nodes can be reduced to the midpoints of the clusters with almost no loss of accuracy. For clusters not in the far field, the traditional BEM has to be applied.

History The play was written in a mixture of the Southern Min dialects of Quanzhou and Chaozhou (Teochew), and is one of the earliest sources on those dialects. The oldest extant manuscripts date from 1566 and 1581. This story is widely spread in Minnan-speaking areas, mainly the south part of Fujian, Chaozhou (a city in eastern Guangdong), Southeast Asia and Taiwan. T√¢n Sa‚Åø G≈çÕò-ni√ª is one of the top four Taiwanese operas. Story T√¢n Sa‚Åø (Tan) is a scholar who is native to Quanzhou, Fujian Province. When he sent his brother and sister in law to Guangnan, he stopped in Chaozhou. During the Lantern Festival, Tan met NÃÇg G≈çÕò-ni√ª (Ng) by chance and they fell in love with each other. Lim, a local rich man's son, also saw Ng in the lantern show, and he was shocked by Ng's beauty. So Lim asked for a blind date and sent a lot of bride-price to Ng's house, because he wanted to marry Ng. Ng's father was greedy so he promised Lim's proposal. Ng did not want to follow his father's decision but she had to, so she fell into deep sorrow. In June, Ng went to the embroidered house accompanied by her maidservant, Ang. At that time, Tan returned to Chaozhou seeking Ng. They recognized each other in the long distance and were filled with all kinds of emotions. Ng threw her handkerchief with lychee to Tan to show her own feeling. Tan was very excited and then he came up with an idea to go to Ng's house to see her again. Several days after, Tan disguised as a person brokes the treasure mirror on purpose. So he could sell himself to Ng's family as a servant to compensate the mirror. Ng guessed Tan's motive so she was very happy but worried. She could not deny the marriage with Lim and stay with Tan forever. A year later, Tan still could not know what Ng's mind exactly. He was so disappointed that he decided to return to Quanzhou. Ang asked the reasons then she sent a letter written by Tan to Ng. After reading his letter, Ng was very moved and met Tan alone. They loved each other deeply and decided to stay with each other no matter how hard the difficulties were. Lim could not wait to marry Ng, so he asked Ng to marry him within three days. Tan and Ng had no choice but to escape from Chaozhou to Quanzhou. References  Li Zhuo Jun (ÊùéÂçìÂêæ; Ming Dynasty).

Primarily a collaboration between core member John Dwyer and regular collaborator Chris Woodhouse, the album is the ninth to be released under the name, Thee Oh Sees. The album was released following initial plans for Thee Oh Sees to take \\"a well deserved break,\\"http://pitchfork.com/news/53409-thee-oh-sees-go-on- indefinite-hiatus/ and was recorded during a \\"transitional period\\" for the band. It did not feature contributions from then-band members Brigid Dawson (vocals, keyboard), Petey Dammit (bass, guitar) and Mike Shoun (drums), and, following the album's release, Dwyer reconfigured Thee Oh Sees line-up into a three piece featuring himself, bass guitarist Tim Hellman and drummer Nick Murray for Drops accompanying tour. Background In 2013, Thee Oh Sees released their fourteenth studio album, Floating Coffin, to widespread critical acclaim and extensive touring. In December 2013, at a concert in San Francisco, core member John Dwyer announced to the audience: \\"This will be the last [Thee] Oh Sees show for a long while, so dig in,\\" fueling speculation that the band was entering an extended hiatus after several years of continuous releases and touring. Both John Dwyer and vocalist and keyboardist Brigid Dawson left the band's home city of San Francisco at this time, with Dwyer moving to Los Angeles and Dawson to Santa Cruz. Thee Oh Sees booking agent, Annie Southworth, confirmed rumors of a hiatus, stating: \\"They need a break after five years straight, so, yes ‚Äì hiatus time. [It] will be a little hard to continue with all the different locales so who know what is going to happen. Cross fingers ‚Äì we all are ‚Äì that it's not completely over.\\" Dwyer, however, noted that the band was not ending. Posting on the band's official website, he wrote: \\"Dear Oh Sees fans, thank you for all your support. The band is not breaking up. This is just a well deserved break and a transitional period. A new Thee Oh Sees LP will be out in early 2014, and we will see where the live show goes from there. Until then, be well.\\" Reflecting upon the confusion, Dwyer later noted, \\"I just said I was taking a break while I moved to LA. It was a reboot of my life. I‚Äôm older, I need some elbow room. I have nothing bad to say about SF, it was just too damn full.\\" Recording Drop is primarily a collaboration between founding member John Dwyer and regular collaborator Chris Woodhouse. The album was recorded in Sacramento, without the participation of then-band members Brigid Dawson (vocals, keyboard), Petey Dammit! (bass, guitar) and Mike Shoun (drums). The duo were joined in the studio by Greer McGettrick, who contributed backing vocals on several songs, and saxophonists Casafi and Mikal Cronin. Regarding the recording process Dwyer stated: \\"Me and Chris worked on it together. I wrote a bunch of demos and then brought them to him. We recorded in a studio in Sacramento, an old banana-ripening warehouse. He plays drums and we switch instruments throughout. We recorded fifteen songs and then cut back. Regardless of what people might think about my output, I've tried to be a little bit better at editing.\\" Release and line-up change Upon Drops release, it was announced that Brigid Dawson, Petey Dammit! and Mike Shoun would no longer be performing with the band at live performances. The accompanying tour saw Thee Oh Sees become a three-piece, with Dwyer accompanied by bassist Timothy Hellman and drummer Nick Murray.

The two buildings are not dissimilar.Springbank Arts: the architect William Swinden Barber Retrieved 18 February 2014 John Mackie's father was Robert Jefferson Mackie, a rich local corn factor from a Scottish family, whose eldest son was Robert Bownas Mackie, Liberal MP for Wakefield 1880‚Äì1885. R.J. Mackie's fourth son was John, who received an education at Wesley College, Sheffield plus the gift of Cliff House which carried attached benefits. Thus Mackie was a landowner, the owner of Cliff Colliery and of the Freeclay works in Crigglestone, and a local benefactor. In 1866 he married Mary Elizabeth Ingham, daughter of James Ingham, the owner of a calico print works at New Mills, Derbyshire. Thereafter, the couple spent half their time in New Mills, and the other half in Calder Grove. Mackie paid for a new school at nearby Painthorpe, completed in 1875. In Derbyshire in the same year he became chairman of the New Mill School Board, and later on was a council representative for New Mills and an alderman on Derbyshire County Council. Back in Crigglestone in 1885, Mackie became chairman of the Liberal Association. While at Calder Grove, he served as a Sunday school teacher, was at one time a delegate to the Diocesan conference, and in 1899 was elected Wakefield YMCA's president. He died unexpectedly at the age of 54 after catching a chill at his and Mary's 25th wedding anniversary celebrations at Crigglestone. He was given a big funeral and buried in Derbyshire. A granite drinking fountain was erected at New Mills in his memory. During her married life in Calder Grove, Mary Mackie organised yearly soirees in the new schoolroom for the local working people, and founded the Criggleston Girls' Friendly Society. Besides erecting the Church of St John the Divine, Calder Grove, in her husband's memory, Mrs Mackie also funded a stained glass east window in the Church of St James, Chapelthorpe in 1892; the window was destroyed by fire in 1951. She also built an institute in Dirtcar, Crigglestone, in 1904.

The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Wakefield on Tuesday 23 May 1893; his sermon was based on John xvi.14, He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.

That is to say, it is locally listed, but is not listed by English Heritage.It is locally listed under no.3078/1687/PRN:10,878, and appears on the 1905, 6 in to 1 mile, OS map, sheet 248 SW. =1893 description= The building was described in Leeds newspapers in 1893 as \\"a Mission church in the Early English style.\\" It is built of Elland stone with Huddersfield stone dressing. The nave has an open-timberwork roof and at the time of the consecration it was long. The chancel was long. The original pews, which as of April 2014 had been re-varnished but were still in place, were of stained and varnished red deal. The east window, installed in 1893, is a memorial to John Mackie. =Exterior= The porch This is a mature work by the architect who retired in 1898. The nave and chancel are combined structurally into one space with four walls, one roof overall, and no columns or aisles. There is a basic porch leading into the nave on the north side. A combined lean-to on the south side houses the organ chamber and vestry, which share an arched opening into the chancel. The exterior combines a simple Victorian low church aspect using just the basics of Gothic Revival architecture. Thus, apart from two small crosses on the apexes of the roof and porch,See image of east gable cross: :File:St John Calder Grove 039.jpgSee image of porch cross: :File:St John Calder Grove 008.jpgThe original plans show a cross on the bell gable and none over the east elevation.

The chancel was rebuilt to Barber's original plans, re-using the same materials. The stencils on the east wall were lost at that time.Information from church archives: local newspaper cutting, source unknown * If one compares the original plans of 1892 to photographs of the existing building in 2014, it can be seen that the stone cross intended for the roof gable above the chancel has been at some point removed to the porch gable. The metal cross which was originally fixed atop the bell gable is now fixed on the roof over the chancel.

This means that any original stencils beneath the later paint on the west wall are now gone.Information from church archives * During a 21st-century interior re-ordering, Barber's original altar was dismantled, and only its carved wooden front remains, standing against the east wall. At the same time, Barber's designed and commissioned dark-varnished pews and choir stalls were stripped and re-varnished in a light colour.Information from church archives. See also images in gallery above * As of April‚ÄìMay 2014 a major re-ordering is planned, so as to adapt the building for dual use as a church and a hall for hire to raise funds. This means that Barber's original pews are to be sold, and a new position must be found for the font. The planning application states that two windows will be removed on the south side of the nave, the sills will be dismantled, and the openings are to be retained for a kitchen serving hatch and an entry point for the extension. It is not known whether the toilet and kitchen, necessarily visible from the road, will be of sympathetic design. Barber's original polished deal floor, which still exists, may be replaced with other flooring. The church is expected therefore to lose its present completeness of original structure and furnishing by a major local architect. Because the new extension will necessitate re-plastering the western half of the south wall, any remaining original interior wall paintings still hidden under paint will be lost. Planning application no.13/00146/FUL for the extension was submitted on 18 January 2013 and has been granted. When the application was submitted, the Church Architect did not know of the building's date, its architect or its history.Wakefield Council planning and building control applications no.13/00146/FUL Retrieved 23 April 2014 Curates Rev.

It provides a touchscreen-enabled interface that allows users to install third-party firmware and back up the current system which are functions often unsupported by stock recovery images. It is, therefore, often installed when flashing, installing, or rooting Android devices, although it isn't dependent on a device being rooted prior to installation.  Functions  Since February 2016 the first three digits of the version number specify the version, and the fourth digit, separated from the others by a dash, specifies an update for a specific device. This could be a performance improvement, hotfix, bugfix, or just simply an update for a device. The main method of installing (\\"flashing\\") this custom recovery on an Android device requires downloading a version made specifically for the device, and then using a tool such as fastboot, Odin. Also, some custom ROMs come with TWRP as the default recovery image. TWRP gives users the option to fully back up their device (including bootloader, system data, private applications, etc.) to revert to at any time, and a built-in file manager to delete files that may be causing problems on the device or add some to fix issues. , TWRP supported the installation of custom ROMs (i.e. custom operating systems such as LineageOS, or the latest Android release), kernels, add-ons (Google Apps, SuperSU, themes, etc.), and other various mods. Wiping, backing up, restoring, and mounting various device partitions, such as the system, boot, userdata, cache, and internal storage partitions are also supported. TWRP also features file transfer via MTP, as well as a basic file manager, and a terminal emulator. It is fully themeable. In January 2017, the TWRP team released an Android applicationOfficial TWRP App that allows flashing the recovery using root access. However, unlike the recovery, the app is not open source. This app is also shipped via the official TWRP images to rooted and non-rooted devices.

History After a dispute with organizers of the Washington County Fair, a track was established at Banks' Sunset Park in 1986. The next year the track added bleachers for use during both races and demolition derbies. In the past the track has also been used for tractor pulls and combine demolition derbies. Mike McCann bought the track in July 1997, and over the next year added bleachers and converted the track to a clay surface. In 2004, long-time racer Doug Walters purchased 40% of the track from McCann, and the two began to make more improvements such as permanent restrooms and better concession stands. The city council then questioned some of those improvements the next year as no permits had been obtained for the work. Owner Doug Walters died in 2008.

Early life and education  Perroy saw his father doodle amateurishly with an acoustic guitar early onClassical Guitar: Judica√´l Perroy in Conversation with Danielle Ribouillault, Volume 26, Issue 12; p.11, August 2008, ISSN 0950-429X, Ashley Mark Publishing Company. Enrolled at the age of seven at the Paris Academy of Music (Conservatoire Municipal Inter-Arrondissements de Paris) he, like other students, started learning the foundations of classical music and the workings of his chosen instrument, the guitar. It was during these early years of formation that one day he claims to have an epiphany: \\"All of a sudden, I understood how the instrument worked, technically\\". From that moment on, he says that playing the guitar became easy. In 1983, at the age of ten, he enrolled at the National School Academy of Aulnay-sous-Bois (a northeastern suburb of Paris) and came under the tutelage of Delia Estrada, Roberto Aussel and later, Raymond Gratien. He was dubbed a \\"child prodigy\\"The Classical Guitar: Its Evolution, Players and Personalities Since 1800, Maurice J. Summerfield, p. 223, Fifth Edition 2002, , Ashley Mark Publishing Company. At the age of eleven he performed two Vivaldi concertos as soloist accompanied by a full orchestra directed by the conductor Andre Girard. The venue was the Theatre du Mans, in Le Mans, a city in central France.California State University Fullerton College of the Arts, Judica√´l Perroy's Concert Program, Thursday April 10, 2014  Career  A second prize placement at the International Competition of the Ile-de-France in 1988 at the age of fourteen was a start for Perroy. In 1988, he graduated summa cum laude and was awarded first prize by the Academy. He continued his studies, first privately with Pablo M√°rquez then with Roberto Aussel and Daniel Lavialle. After starting courses in Economics and Mathematics at the university, he stopped playing the guitar for two years, from 17 to 19 years of age. He restarted playing a few weeks before the 15√®me Concours International de guitarre Ren√© Bartoli at the urging of Raymond Gratien and won Grand prize (awarded by the jury) as well as Audience prize (awarded by the public in attendance). Perroy then went on to earn his diploma from the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris in 1994 after attending classes with Alberto Ponce. The same year he earned his License de Concert (1994), he competed in the 7th International Guitar Competition of Bourg-Madame, placing first by audience assignment. Two years later (1996) he was the first prize winner of the graduating class of the Conservatoire National de Musique et de Dance de Paris. He then entered the international scene by winning the prestigious Guitar Foundation of America International Solo CompetitionAdelaide Festival CentreICACW winners of 1997 held that year in La Jolla, California. The prize came with a sixty-city tour of North America in 1998. Subsequently, he toured the globe both as performer and teacher. Many of his students had been competition winners, three of them winning the GFA, including Thomas Viloteau.  Current academic positions  Judicael Perroy lives in Paris. He has held the titles of Professor of Classical Guitar at the following institutions: P√¥le sup' 93 Seine-Saint-Denis-√éle-de-France (Aubervilliers) (2012‚Äìpresent); L'Association de pr√©figuration du P√¥le Superiour d'enseignements artistiques (apPSEA) at Lille (Nord-Pas-de-Calais) (2010‚Äìpresent); and L'√âcole Nationale de Musique d'Aulnay-sous-Bois (2004‚Äìpresent).

Born in Skelmersdale, Lancashire, Holmes had trial spells with both Liverpool and Wigan Borough in 1925 but was an employed as a miner and playing for local side Prescot Cables when he was spotted by Chesterfield in 1930. Signed by Chesterfield in May of that year, Holmes remained with the Derbyshire club for just one season before being signed by Division One side Sheffield United in May 1931 for ¬£1,750. Making his debut for United in October 1931 in an away fixture at Manchester City, Holmes became a regular in the Blades defence for the next four years. Holmes was regarded as a robust and tough tackling defender with a fiery temper, highlighted when a referee ruled out a goal Holmes had scored, only for the defender to pick up the official and \\"shake him like a dog would a rat\\" according to press reports. Having missed very few fixtures, Holmes was sidelined by injury at the start of the 1935‚Äì36 season and was replaced by Tom Johnson. Despite Holmes regaining his fitness, Johnson's impressive form meant that by December 1935 he was firmly established as first choice, resulting in Holmes making only occasional appearances from then on. In May 1936 Holmes moved to West Ham United for ¬£750 where he played for a season, before joining Reading in July 1937. Holmes remained with the club following the onset of World War II, but having made two guest appearances for his former club Chesterfield in 1940, he retired from playing and returned to his former profession as a miner.

The college was accorded the status of deficit grants-in-aid in 1972 by the Government of Assam. Before this, the college had run on a self-sustaining basis with many teachers preferring to embrace the nobility of the profession, turning their backs on lucrative opportunities elsewhere. In the formative stages the college offered pre-university (Arts) programme. A full-fledged pre-university Commerce course started in 1984. The undergraduate arts classes got underway in the 1966-67 session and the programme got affiliation from Gauhati University in 1971. The Degree Commerce classes started in 1978. Bowing to the public demand for postgraduate course in English, the college authority took steps to begin the two-year PG course in 1991. Immediately afterwards Gauhati University granted affiliation to the PG programme. Since 2002 the PG course in English is running on semester system. Courses The college has two programmes at UG level, i.e., B.A and B.Com (three-year degree course) and one programme at PG level, i.e., M.A in English and Hindi.

It depicts a cannery strike in Watsonville, California. Watsonville and the 1995 play Circle in the Dirt were published together in a single book by the West End Press. It is the sequel to the 1994 play Heroes and Saints.Pareles, p. 43. The play was a project of Stanford University.Pignataro, p. 28-29. \\"La obra Watsonville: Some Place Not Here (1996) fue parte de una proyecto de Stanford University por el cual Moraga entra a East Palo Alto ‚Äî una comunidad cerca de la universidad‚Äî y de ello resulta una creatividad colectiva por su comunicacion con el pueblo para investigar los sentimientos de la gente en cuanto a los acontecimientos sociales, geograficos y religiosos en la region de California ‚Äîlos \\"cannery strikes\\" (Watsonville/Circle in the Dirt 4) del 1985‚Äì1987; el terremoto de grado 7.1 de 1989 en California, y la apariencia de la Virgen de Guadalupe en un roble en el parque del condado Pinto Lake en 1992 (Watsonville/Circle in the Dirt 4). Por lo tanto, tal obra teatral era un proyecto iniciado por un programa universitario y ligado a la comunidad.\\" Pareles wrote that Watsonville criticizes anti-immigration policies in California and Mexican-Americans perceived to have sold out to Anglo culture, or vendidos, who believe such policies should be compromised with. Ruben Mendoza of Confluencia: Revista Hispanica de Cultura y Literatura wrote that the play uses a communal third place (also known as a third space) to criticize \\"capitalist spatial practice\\".Mendoza, p. 132. In addition the play also discusses the labor movement's gender and immigrant rights situation. Moraga stated that the play is based \\"loosely on three actual events that took place in a central California coastal farm worker town by the same name.\\"Thompson, p. 524. These events were a 1985‚Äì1987 cannery strike, a 1989 7.1 Richter scale earthquake, and a vision of the Lady of Guadalupe in the Pinto Lake county park. Lisa B. Thompson of the Theatre Journal wrote that there is \\"drama with vibrant dialogue and compelling, diverse characters\\" because Moraga did not use the words of those she interviewed for research purposes verbatim and instead \\"the voices Moraga listened to while researching the plays merge with her own.\\" Watsonville has select phrases and sentences in the dialog in the Spanish language instead of English. The play, along with Circle in the Dirt, uses dialog that is a mixture of English and Spanish to paraphrase the content of the interviews conducted by Moraga; most of the actual interviews were done entirely in Spanish.Pareles, p. 144. The music in the play includes bolero, cumbia, and rap. Some of the music includes original compositions. Plot In the play, set in the mid-1990s, workers in a Watsonville, California cannery strike. The workers at the Pajaro Valley Cannery strike partly because they want additional rights,Mendoza, p. 134. and also because they want to be paid better wages. As strategies the workers use a type of protest theater used by El Teatro Campesino and they also use hunger strikes in the manner done by C√©sar Ch√°vez. At the same time, the area Latino community faces divisions as anti-immigration legislation is being proposed in California. During the play the politicians deliberate on Bill 1519, which is intended to separate the workers into legal residents and illegal immigrants as a way to divide them, referring to real-life border control legislation. Marissa Pareles of the Lambda Book Report wrote that \\"the end of the play \\"has only a bit of a Deus ex Machina feeling about it\\". Lisa B. Thompson wrote that realism is the predominant atmosphere of the work, but that the work highlights the importance of the spiritual aspect of protesting by giving some characters relationships with spirits of the deceased and also having the Virgin of Guadalupe appear on a tree trunk. An earthquake with the magnitude 7.5 occurs during the story. Characters * Lucha ‚Äì A cannery worker, she learns enough English to use the language to express her romantic desire for Susana.Mendoza, p. 137. * Susana ‚Äì Susana is physician's assistant at a community clinic, and she is an activist.

It is written by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu. In the United States, the episode originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 9, 2014, the first new episode to air on the series' new Wednesday time slot. The episode was viewed by 1.098 million viewers, becoming the thirty-sixth most watched episode aired by the network for the week of April 7 to April 13, 2014. The episode shows Pearl attempting to teach Steven the art of sword-fighting using Holo-Pearl, a holographic version of herself. However, during the lessons, Pearl gets injured and retreats into her gem to heal and make a new body to project. Plot While Steven (Zach Callison), Garnet (Estelle), Amethyst (Michaela Dietz) and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) are watching the fictional Japanese movie Lonely Blade, Pearl critiques the film's sword fighting techniques and offers to give Steven a proper demonstration. At her arena, Pearl summons \\"Holo-Pearl\\", a holographic version of herself to spar with. After Pearl wins a sparring match with Holo-Pearl, she begins to show Steven the basics of sword-fighting. However, Pearl's lessons bore Steven, making him clamor for Pearl to teach him the signature move from the Lonely Blade movie, much to Pearl's chagrin. While Pearl is distracted talking to Steven, Holo-Pearl impales Pearl with her sword, which causes Pearl to lose her physical form, leaving nothing but her gemstone. Although Steven is distraught, Garnet and Amethyst assure him that Pearl has simply retreated into her gem and will return, projecting a new body, once she has healed. Two weeks pass, and Pearl is still healing inside her gem. Steven decides to use Holo-Pearl as a replacement for the real Pearl. However, Holo- Pearl only knows how to sword fight, seeing everything as a potential opponent. Garnet and Amethyst urge Steven to stop using it and wait for the real Pearl to come back. After Holo-Pearl cuts down the real Pearl's favorite tree, Steven becomes infuriated and tries to drive Holo-Pearl away. Later that night, Holo-Pearl continues to ask Steven to be challenged in combat, though he repeatedly refuses. But when she destroys the television, Steven becomes fed up and fights back against Holo-Pearl, accidentally activating her \\"advanced\\" mode. After an intense fight, Steven is able to destroy Holo-Pearl permanently. Garnet and Amethyst hear the commotion and come to check on Steven; and while he is explaining what he has learned, Pearl finally regenerates with a new outfit and faces the mess left from what recently happened, while Steven happily parades around celebrating her return. Production The episode was written by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu. Ki-Yong Bae, Seon-Jae Lee and Seo Whan Kim provided animation direction, Elle Michalka served as art director, and Ian Jones-Quartey provided supervising direction. A sneak peek of the episode was shared on io9 on April 7, 2014, with Johnston first announcing the episode on the series' production blog the following day, shortly after the series' new Wednesday time slot was promoted on April 2. In addition, several promotional pieces were published by him, Rebecca Sugar and color stylist Tiffany Ford, encouraging followers to watch. A panel from the storyboard was also promoted, before various background art and animation props were released before and after its premiere; the animation props indicate the episode was produced thirteenth in production order. The soundtrack features the instrumental pieces \\"Dance of Swords\\" and \\"Holo Pearl\\" by pianist Aivi Tran and sound designer Steven Velema of the musical group Aivi & Surasshu. The latter track was composed to resemble the \\"broken facsimile\\" nature of the Pearl clone who bears the song's title. The group utilized a \\"glitchy\\" piano and \\"an erratic collection of sounds\\" for it. The tracks were released onto SoundCloud on April 12 and 13, respectively. Cultural references Gergo Vas from Kotaku observed various video game references during Pearl's lecture on swordfighting, including Pok√©mon, Final Fantasy VII, Gitaroo Man and Sonic the Hedgehog. In addition, he identified an homage to Revolutionary Girl Utena upon looking at GIFs of Pearl's sword- fighting scene with her hologram clone. Writing for Cartoon Brew, Kendra Beltran noted that Lonely Blade imitated the style of anime, stating that \\"while the Universe team didn't overdo the animation on the anime, you could tell what they were going for without hearing the accents.\\" Reception \\"Steven the Sword Fighter\\" was the first episode to premiere outside of Monday, onto its new time slot of Wednesdays, on Cartoon Network. Upon its premiere on April 9, 2014, the episode was seen by 1.098 million viewers. It received a Nielsen household rating of 0.7, and was ranked as the thirty-sixth most watched episode aired by the network for the week of April 7 to April 13, 2014. Beltran highlighted elements of horror in the episode, noting it to come \\"in small spurts toward the end\\", while writing about the \\"eerie tone of the rainy night matched with the sword-wielding psychopath hologram.\\" She found it \\"weird to see Steven trying to not replace her,\\" regarding her as the established mother figure in the series. She concluded her review stating that while \\"not much for characterization,\\" Amethyst and Garnet's acts of \\"sitcom comedy\\" were \\"the source of laughter this time around\\" for the series. Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club graded the episode an A‚àí, calling it, \\"in many ways, a perfect distillation of what makes Steven Universe special.\\" He noted Steven's attempts to learn sword-fighting as a callback to the first episode, \\"Gem Glow\\", which aired alongside \\"Steven the Sword Fighter\\" upon its premiere. Finally, he contrasted Steven's childishness and refusal to completely learn lessons to Adventure Time and Regular Show, where the protagonists of each have taken steps toward maturity.

The main building of the service station is representative of the \\"house\\" style of filling station; such stations resembled small houses in order to fit into residential areas. . The service station was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1995.  History  The station opened in 1930, first owned by Albert Hutto, who later sold it to Frank Skinner. The station sold Magnolia Petroleum products until 1955, when it was sold again and began carrying Phillips 66 products, before closing in the 1960s. The structure was originally built with just the central block building, with the canopy and side garage added on later. The sign on the structure, advertising a former mechanic shop, had its lettering removed by 2019.  Condition  Despite historic status, the building remains in an advanced state of decay. , the side garage had been completely removed after being damaged for many years, the canopy has partially collapsed, and the interior is also in extremely poor condition.

Their own automobile manufacturing business, Ceirano GB & C and its Welleyes motorcar, had been taken over by Giovanni Agnelli and his new F.I.A.T. consortium in 1899, whereupon the Welleyes was marketed as the F.I.A.T. 4HP, the first ever Fiat. The Ceiranos were not satisfied as employees and 'Italian sales agents' of F.I.A.T. so they founded Fratelli Ceirano & C in Turin, which, by July 1903 had morphed into Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid which was known by its acronym S.T.A.R. and the cars were badged as Rapid. Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co- founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA).

Geography The ecoregion stretches east and west across West Africa, from the Atlantic coast of Senegal to the Mandara Mountains on Nigeria's eastern border. The drier Sahelian Acacia savanna lies to the north, and the more humid Guinean forest-savanna mosaic lies to the south. Climate The climate is tropical. Annual rainfall ranges from 1000 mm in the south to 600 mm in the north on the edge of the Sahel. Rainfall and temperature vary seasonally, with a hot rainy season from May to September, and a cooler dry season from October to April. Temperatures range from 30¬∞C to 33¬∞C during the hottest month, and 18¬∞C to 21¬∞C during the coolest month. Flora Savanna and open woodland are the characteristic vegetation types. Species of Combretum and Terminalia are the typical savanna trees, and the ground is covered with long grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Species of Hyparrhenia, or elephant grass, is the predominant grass, and often grows 1 meter or more in height. Trees in the drier woodlands generally less than 10 meters high, and include Anogeissus spp. with Acacia spp., Balanites aegyptiaca, Combretum glutinosum, Commiphora africana, Prosopis africana, Tamarindus indica, and Ziziphus mucronata. Many trees lose their leaves during the height of the dry season, and the grasses often dry out. Acacia is less common in the wetter woodlands in higher-rainfall areas and along watercourses, where Afzelia africana, Burkea africana, Combretum spp. and Terminalia spp. are predominant. Smaller areas of Isoberlinia woodland occur in more humid portions of the southern ecoregion. Fauna The ecoregion is home to many large mammals, including African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), West African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta), giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus derbianus), roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer brachyceros), lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus) cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Most large mammals are now very limited in range and numbers. Conservation A 2017 assessment found that 233,942 km¬≤, or 14%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017).

Its core business and focus is life and non-life insurance. At present, CIG Pannonia is engaged in the life insurance business in Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. History = Foundation = On 26 October 2007, the company was founded by well-known and acknowledged public figures and insurance experts from Hungary; its original name was CIG Central European Insurance Company. CIG was supported by the U.S. Inverstment bank Lehman Brothers. It also had a successful partnership with Brokernet, one of Hungary's largest financial agencies. In 2008, the company became market leader in niche markets like regular-premium, unit-linked life insurance products and closed the year with a turnover of US$ 13 million. In 2009, CIG held a 3% market share in domestic life insurance and generated over US$ 40 million in sales. On 1 January 2010, the company changed its name to CIG Pannonia Life Insurance Ltd. Later that year, the insurer commenced operations as a public limited company. The company's shares have been listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange. The first trading day was November 8, 2010. Between 2011 and 2015 CIG started its 100% non-life subsidiary, which focuses on domestic SMEs, Institutions of the state and local authorities, companies, professional chambers and associations. Throughout the years the subsidiary grew and stayed profitable. On the other hand, 2015 was the year when CIG broke up with Brokernet, setting up an all-time low at 135 HUF. This event disappointed many individual investors and speculants. As a result the stock became an unpopular investment in 2016. Between 2016 and 2018 the company attracted another institutional investor, the Konzlum Plc. They bought a 24.85% stake in CIG pushing up the stock price between 400-500 HUF. = Regional expansion = The first step of the Company‚Äôs regional expansion was the launch of the sale of its products in Romania in May 2009. Later, in September 2010, the Company began its sales activities in Slovakia as well. On 1 September 2010, the Company became a public limited company and is now called CIG Pann√≥nia Life Insurance Plc. (CIG Pann√≥nia √âletbiztos√≠t√≥ Nyrt.). The subscription procedure in October 2010 was highly successful and drew massive public interest. Later, after the initial public offering, the Company requested to be listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and from 2011 listed on BSE's prime market.https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0CK:GR/profile In April 2012 CIG started a cross-border service in Poland in the non-life segment. Followed by the Baltic States in 2013. The company launched their cross-border service in the non-life segment in Italy in September 2014 and in Spain in September 2017.  Products and business model  The main products include unit-linked life insurance and pension insurance, but CIG also sells traditional life insurance, funeral insurance, endowment and term life insurance and health insurance. Its subsidiary operates the property insurance business not only in Hungary but also in many European countries through cross-border services. CIG is primarily active in the life insurance sector. The most profitable products are pension insurance and unit-linked insurance.  Management  = Beginnings = Former Minister of Finance and chairman of the central bank Zsigmond J√°rai was appointed to chair the Supervisory Board, which represents the owners. B√©la Horv√°th, former top executive of various Hungarian insurance companies, was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The position of the CEO has been filled by dr. Ott√≥ Csurg√≥ since 18 April 2012, who is also the CEO of CIG Pann√≥nia First Hungarian General Insurance Plc. The Company is heir in spirit to the First Hungarian General Insurance Company (Els≈ë Magyar √Åltal√°nos Biztos√≠t√≥ T√°rsas√°g) founded in 1857 by Henrik L√©vay. In those days, as well as nowadays, Hungary lacked an insurance company run by Hungarian management, focusing on the Hungarian market and supported and privately financed by recognized and credible Hungarian personalities. Back then, just like today, it was necessary to have a professional leader with an intimate knowledge of the local economy and the opportunities of the insurance market, who had the organisational expertise necessary to build an entire new insurance company, who had significant past achievements and could convince major supporters to back the cause of founding a new insurance company. = Today = Gabriella Kadar joined the company in 2009 as alternative sales channel director. Prior she worked as fund manager, marketing and business development director for ING Group and Deloiette Hungary from 1994. She became the current CEO in 2014. Dr. Gabriella K√°d√°r graduated from the Faculty of Law of ELTE. After being admitted to the Bar, she obtained qualifications in insurance law.

Its role was to resolve disputes between retailers and retail customers. Background In July 2015 The EU Alternative Dispute Resolution Directive was planned to come into force. It was delayed until 1 October 2015 in line with the Consumer Rights Act 2015. Under the new system companies are obliged to point customers to private complaints-handling companies but would not be bound by their decisions unless they agreed to subscribe to the ADR scheme. This directive allowed for more private companies to handle consumer complaints in sectors including retail, aviation, furniture and property. On 1 January 2015, barrister Dean Dunham started as the Chief Ombudsman at the Retail Ombudsman. Establishment The Retail Ombudsman was a retail alternative dispute resolution (ADR) scheme, and was set up to resolve disputes between shops and customers. During its first weekend in business, the Retail Ombudsman claimed to have received more than 300 complaints. Sir Eric Peacock was chairman of the Retail Ombudsman.

He noted \\"Ms. Baker may just have the subtlest way with exposition of anyone writing for the theater today. Through the small details and telling asides we learn the fundamentals of this friendship, founded on a mutual sense of generalized alienation. At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, I‚Äôll go so far as to say there is something distinctly Chekhovian in the way her writing accrues weight and meaning simply through compassionate, truthful observation... her subjects in 'The Aliens' are mighty indeed: no less than love and death, and how these two facets of human existence are woven into the fabric of life, the first sometimes unacknowledged or undivulged, the second ineluctable and often unforeseen. To say any more would be unfair, for the second act of this seemingly slight play takes a turn that is quietly devastating.\\"Isherwood, Charles. Theater Review. 'The Aliens' April 2010 The Theatermania reviewer wrote that The Aliens \\"is another offbeat, slyly intriguing drama with comedy... There are seemingly more minutes of silence than there are of dialogue in Baker's script; the leanness makes strange and intriguing even the most banal exchanges.

HIFK Bandy was founded in 1907 and it is one the oldest bandy clubs in Finland. HIFK are also the most successful bandy club with 17 championship titles. In 1988 they were European Cup runners-up. HIFK Bandy currently plays in Bandyliiga, the premier bandy league in Finland.  History  HIFK Bandy was formed in 1907 as a bandy section of HIFK sports club formed in 1897. HIFK competed in the very first Finnish bandy championships in the winter of 1908. The team fared well in the early years of the competition winning their first title in 1910 and then again in 1911, 1912 and 1913. In the 1930s HIFK were again in top form gathering 3 more titles within 10 years. During war years of Second world war the team grabbed the top position in 1941 and 1944, along with victories in the unofficial wartime league of 1940 and 1942. After the war HIFK found themselves in a slump and were relegated from Bandyliiga and spent five years in the Suomisarja, a second-tier bandy league. By the 1970s, things were back in shape with the construction of Oulunkyl√§ artificial ice rink which was used for training and HIFK grabbed the title again in 1978. During this time, HIFK developed a healthy rivalry with local Botnia-69 who they competed against in front of thousands of spectators who had come to watch the two teams from Helsinki clash. In the late 80s HIFK struck gold again, winning the title twice in 1988 and 1989. In the following years many older players retired and HIFK was forced to rebuild itself from the ground up. The rejuvenated team grabbed a their first title in 1998 but had to mature and wait until the late 2000s to find their top form again. The prize came eventually and HIFK won their first titles of the 21st century in 2010 and 2011. In 2013 HIFK beat Naruker√§ from Pori in the final by a score of 3-1 - making the team most successful bandy club in Finland with 17 titles. HIFK placed second in 2014-15 season after losing to Mikkelin Kampparit 6-3 in the final, played on HIFK's home ground.

Early life Puryear was born in 1973 to Gail and Shirley Puryear and was raised on their winery in Yakima Valley, Washington. In his youth, he took up carpentry, winemaking and farm work, and developed an interest in mountain climbing after his parents took him to Mount Adams when he was fifteen. He attended the University of Washington, where he earned a degree in mathematics. Mountaineering Beginning in 1996, Puryear worked for four seasons as a climbing ranger at Mount Rainier National Park, where he met fellow ranger Mark Westman. Puryear and Westman climbed together in the North Cascades, Yosemite National Park, Patagonia, and most frequently, the Alaska Range. In Alaska, they made ascents of Mount McKinley's south buttress and Cassin Ridge (2000) and Mount Foraker's Infinite Spur (2001). Puryear's other achievements in the Alaska Range included the first ascent of the Black Crystal Ar√™te route on the Kichatna Spire, the Goldfinger route on the Stump, the Harvard Route on Mount Huntington, the Mount Silverthrone's west face, and the first speed ascent of Mount Barill via the Cobra Pillar. Using his own photographs and graphic design, and based on 30 ascents and a decade's worth of climbing in the region, Puryear wrote a guidebook to the Alaska Range, which was published by SuperTopo in 2006. Shortly afterwards, he was hired by Sherpa Adventure Gear as a photographer and the editor of their product catalog, which allowed him to finance his climbing trips after leaving his job at the National Park Service. Puryear began climbing in the Himalayas in 2003, attracting sponsorship from companies and winning a climbing grant to support his attempts to ascend unclimbed mountains in China and Nepal. Over seven years, he made seven trips to the Himalayas. In China, he and Chad Kellogg made the first ascents of Lara Shan, Mount Daogou and the Angry Wife; in Nepal, he and David Gottlieb made the first ascents of Kang Nachugo, Takargo and Jobo Rinjang. =Death on Labuche Kang= In October 2010, Puryear and Gottlieb traveled to Tibet to climb Labuche Kang, a remote mountain in the Himalayas. While he was climbing unroped on the mountain, on October 27 Puryear broke through a cornice and fell to his death. At the time of his death, the Seattle Times referred to Puryear as \\"one of the country's most elite alpinists\\".

He is best known for being a member and founder of the hard rock band, Krokus.  History  = Childhood, youth and first experiences as a musician (1951-1975) = The Band Inside; left to right: Chris von Rohr, Peter Richard, Tommy Kiefer Chris von Rohr, along with his half-brother Stephan von Rohr, comes from a middle-class family in Solothurn, where he spent most of his childhood.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 34, 40. His first musical experience Chris von Rohr gained at his parents piano.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 47‚Äì48. During his school years in mostly local schools (apart from a brief interlude at a boarding school Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz - where he was able to play drums for the very first time), von Rohr's father gave him his first drum set as a gift.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 50, 53‚Äì54, 55. In 1967, he formed his first band called The Scouts.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 56. The band changed names multiple times, from Tears Of Love to In and finally Indian Summer. With this formation the young drummer also completed his first public appearance at a student ball in the Hotel Krone in Solothurn.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 70, 74. After a two-year stint at the public business school in Neuch√¢tel von Rohr founded more bands: first, the Plastic Joints and thereafter Inside.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 74, 80‚Äì81, 83. Meanwhile, the musician von Rohr kept himself financially afloat as a cook in the Solothurn Restaurant & Hotel Kreuz - the first Genossenschaftsbeiz of Switzerland.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 80. After a for von Rohr in terms of musical style all in all very unpleasant but at least financially lucrative short stint with a dance band called On the Road, he and their keyboarder Michi Szabo formed the two- man band Night Train.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 92, 100. However, all these attempts to make it in the professional music business failed and so von Rohr worked again as a cook at the Restaurant Kreuz, followed by a semester at the Jazz School in Bern.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 105. = Rise and international breakthrough with Krokus: The rise to a rock star (1975-1983) = After finishing studies at the Jazz School, von Rohr returned to Solothurn to form another band in November 1975: Krokus.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 111. Their first public gig was opening for Nella Martinetti at the Saalbau of the Swiss town of Gerlafingen.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì Krokus (First) Together with lead guitarist Tommy Kiefer, with whom drummer von Rohr alternated lead vocals, rhythm guitarist Hansi Droz and bassist Remo Spadino finally the very progressive debut album Krokus. was recorded and released in 1976, produced by Peter J. Mac Taggart. With the rights to the band name Krokus secured and his bandmates unceremoniously released, he formed a new alliance with band members of the local band Montezuma, changing the line-up of Krokus completely: Von Rohr himself took over lead vocals, Fernando von Arb played guitar, on bass J√ºrg Naegeli and Freddy Steady on the drums.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì To You All Shortly thereafter, guitarist Tommy Kiefer was brought back to the line-up and the band was complete once again.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 125. With this line-up the band recorded once more at the Sinus Studio in Bern, produced again by Peter J. Mac Taggart and released in 1977 their second studio album To You All, which was released in 1977 and revealing for the first time a hard rock sound.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 129, 131. Von Rohr (on vocals) and Tommy Kiefer end of the 1970s With the same line-up, still with von Rohr as front man, Krokus recorded their third, totally hard rock album Pain Killer, which was also released as Pay It In Metal.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì Painkiller This album was recorded within 6 days in no other than the legendary Manor Studios in Oxford in 1978 and produced by von Rohr and von Arb. Although von Rohr received from Switzerland's Pop Magazine (the equivalent of Rolling Stone magazine in the USA) the \\"Golden Hammer Award\\" as #1 vocalist and Krokus #1 rock band of the year in their home country of Switzerland, the band's future musical direction changed once more when all band members witnessed a concert by AC/DC at the Volkshaus in Z√ºrich. Consequently, von Rohr had a vision and he voluntarily surrendered his vocal duties first to Henry Fries, who had to bow out because of prior contractual obligations, and finally - after persistent recruiting attempts by von Rohr himself - found in Marc Storace the singer with the powerful vocal range he envisioned. Von Rohr switched to bass and J√ºrg Naegeli was in charge of the band's keyboards and sound. The last missing piece of the puzzle fell in place with this new line-up for the perfect Krokus sound. Soon thereafter, the band recorded their fourth studio album Metal Rendez-Vous at Platinum One Studio in Zurich, produced by Martin Pearson, von Rohr and von Arb.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì Metal Rendez-Vous This album proved to be the band's international breakthrough. Triple-platinum in Switzerland and first concert tours in Great Britain and the United States followed, including the legendary \\"percussion battle\\" between von Rohr and drummer Freddy Steady. Thus, von Rohr and his fellow band members became an almost overnight success, internationally respected and well-known rock stars. Immediately after the touring ended, the band went into the Roundhouse Studios in London to work on their fifth studio album, which again was produced by von Rohr and von Arb, to be finally released in 1981 as Hardware.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì Hardware As its predecessor, the album turned out to be a total success and earned gold status in Switzerland. As a result of the continuing drug problems and unreliability of lead guitarist Kiefer, first cracks in the band structure were obvious and could not be ignored any longer, although the rise of the band in popularity continued. After the release of the album, the band and Kiefer went separate ways.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 192‚Äì193. Mandy Meyer replaced Kiefer for the tours throughout Europe and the USA. However, Krokus and Meyer went their separate ways immediately after completion of the tour. Without further ado rhythm guitarist Mark Kohler joined the band.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì One Vice at a Time This line-up eventually recorded at the Battery Studios in London - produced by Tony Platt, von Rohr and von Arb - their sixth studio album One Vice at a Time. Released in 1982, it not only validated the status of Krokus but raised it one notch higher. The album reached gold status not only in Switzerland but for the first time in the band's history earned gold status in the U.S. and Canada. On top of that Krokus set another record as the first and so far only Swiss band ever to sell out the Hallenstadion in Zurich. More extensive tours through North America and Europe followed the album release. In between all of Krokus' touring commitments, von Rohr managed to find time to produce Night Fighting, Steve Whitney Band's second studio album, this time as the sole producer in charge.mikiwiki.org ‚Äì Steve Whitney Band Meanwhile, Krokus lineup changes continued: Drummer Steady was dismissed and replaced by Steve Pace. What followed, however, was nothing less than the culmination and highlight of the band's career : the seventh studio album Headhunter, recorded by Tom Allom at Bee Jay Studio in Orlando, Florida and released in 1983. This album earned for the first time and, unmatched until now, platinum status in the U.S. and Canada, and also gold in Switzerland.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì Headhunter As a result of this album's success, the band was invited to join the second-largest U.S. tour of the year as \\"special guests\\": The Pyromania tour of British rock band Def Leppard, who became hugely popular in the U.S. at that time, and Gary Moore as opening act. During this time, von Rohr and his bandmates were also appointed honorary citizens of the U.S. state of Tennessee.sokultur.ch ‚Äì Chris von Rohr Even though, or perhaps because of the wave of success the band enjoyed at this time, within the next few months two serious negative experiences changed the course of events once more: First, Krokus was kicked off the Pyromania tour because of several missteps by singer Marc Storace and band manager Butch Stone - the band eventually finished their North American tour as supporting act of Judas Priest - and on the other hand another wave of line-up changes. First rhythm guitarist Mark Kohler was dismissed and replaced by Patrick Mason, and finally von Rohr, the last remaining founding member of the band, was ousted because he openly talked to Switzerland's daily newspaper Blick about his experience on the road and the tour excesses that followed as well as his rebellion against the business antics of their U.S. manager Stone.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 368, 379‚Äì380, 392, 398. = Forced reorientations: Activities as music producer, author and solo artist (1983-1987) = Dismissed by Krokus at once, Chris von Rohr found himself on his own overnight. During this period, the ousted bass player and founder of the band took on diverse projects: firstly, he produced in 1985 the first and only self-titled studio album of the Swiss band Headhunter.metal-archives.com ‚Äì Headhunter (Switzerland) In addition to his first official job as a producer, Von Rohr also started to write his first book, which was published in 1991 and entitled Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken (Dogs, do you want to rock forever). The book described the insane events around and within Krokus and helped him to process that entire experience mentally, thus finding closure.Chris von Rohr: Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken: Mein Trip durch den Rockdschungel, 1991, S. 405. In addition, von Rohr released his first and so far only solo album Hammer and Tongue in 1987.chrisvonrohr.ch ‚Äì Music = Brief return to Krokus (1987-1989) = Shortly after releasing his solo album, von Rohr returned to Krokus in 1987. Plain and simply stated, it turned out to be the best solution for all parties involved.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Press ‚Äì Heart Attack Together again at last, von Rohr and his old bandmates Marc Storace, Fernando von Arb, Mark Kohler and Dani Crivelli, who played drums on his solo album, recorded at J√ºrg Naegeli‚Äôs Pink recording studio in Zuchwil their tenth studio album. Produced by von Rohr and von Arb, Krokus released Heart Attack in 1988.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Chronological ‚Äì Heart Attack The album charted 5th place in the Swiss album charts, a first for von Rohr and Krokus. It was the return to Hard Rock, which had catapulted the band in the early 1980s into the worldwide spotlight and away from the shallow pop-metal orientation the band presented itself on the previous album, Change of Address. However, after touring throughout Europe and the United States, all parties realized shortly thereafter that the thrill was gone, mainly it seemed to be impossible to restore the feeling and groove of the past. Mounting management problems and both Marc Storace and Fernando von Arb throwing in the towel due to symptoms of extreme fatigue and exhaustion, marked the first official break-up in the band's history. = Various activities as a musician, journalist and radio host (1989 - 1991) = After the dissolution of Krokus, Chris von Rohr worked under the pseudonym J. LaCross as producer of the first studio album Metal Marathon by a band called The Heavy‚Äôs. This album consisted of a collection of shortened and re-arranged classic rock and metal cover medleys.heavyharmonies.com ‚Äì The Heavy‚Äôs ‚Äì Metal Marathon Shortly thereafter, von Rohr founded a band called Grand Slam with Peter Tanner on vocals as well as lead guitarist Many Maurer, rhythm guitarist Tony Castell and drummer Peter Haas.krokusonline.seven49.net ‚Äì Press ‚Äì Stampede With this group he toured Germany, Austria and Hungary ‚Äì mainly playing material from his solo album - until he left the band in late 1989.

An autobiography entitled Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken (Dogs, do you wanna rock forever) that gave the reader a direct, honest and genuine insight to the childhood and youth of the musician as well as behind the scenes recollections during his rock star days with Krokus.booklooker.de ‚Äì Hunde wollt ihr ewig rocken Subsequently, the literary work, in which the author recalls the highs and lows of his career in his own words, became a cult book and bestseller not only for rock and metal fans. That same year, Chris von Rohr also started his collaboration with the Swiss hard rock band Gotthard, via their band manager Marco Antognini.20min.ch ‚Äì Steril, k√ºnstlich und emotionsarm This cooperation turned out to be the beginning of a success story for both sides, as already the first, released in 1992, self-titled studio album Gotthard reached a significant chart position by making it to #5 in the Swiss charts.hitparade.ch ‚Äì Gotthard ‚Äì Charts ‚Äì Alben A year later, besides his duties with Gotthard, von Rohr also re-released his 1987 solo album Hammer and Tongue, this time however under the title The Good, The Bad and The D√∂g including the bonus track \\"See You Walking\\".heavyharmonies.com ‚Äì Chris von Rohr ‚Äì Hammer and Tongue Following this reissue, von Rohr‚Äôs focus was again entirely on Gotthard and what followed was, despite or because of persistent internal tensions - at least in Switzerland - a single musical triumph. All of the following studio and live albums of the band, produced by von Rohr, particularly Dial Hard in 1994, G. in 1996, D-Frosted in 1997 and Open in 1999 reached number 1 in the Swiss album charts. Moreover, even several singles were able to rank in the music charts of the Alpine republic of Switzerland.hitparade.ch ‚Äì Gotthard ‚Äì Charts ‚Äì Songs Von Rohr as juror at MusicStar After that von Rohr participated on the ninth studio album of Polo Hofer & The Schmetterband (a Swiss dialect band) called H√§rzbluet, which was released in January 2000. The two songs \\"Es saftigs M√ºntschi\\" and \\"B√§rner‚Äù were both co-composed and co- produced by von Rohr. Through his connections in the music biz von Rohr initiated and produced the song \\"Who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot\\", a duet by Polo Hofer with the U.S. blues musician Willy DeVille. This short detour into Swiss dialect collaborations was followed by a very significant private event of the successful musician and producer: the birth of his daughter Jewel in 2001. Nevertheless, there was no resting on his laurels - on the contrary: With the studio album Homerun in 2001, which included the number-one single \\"Heaven\\", and the compilation One Life One Soul: Best of Ballads in 2002, he produced two other releases with Gotthard, which in turn landed at # 1 on the Swiss album charts. However, despite the successful joint working relationship over the last 11 years, that had its up‚Äôs and down‚Äôs and was not always easy for both sides, band and mentor von Rohr parted ways anno 2002. = Second bestseller, \\"Meh Dr√§ck\\" and beyond that some more varied activities (2002 - 2008) = Von Rohr in his TV-Show Black'n'Blond Following the separation with Gotthard and with respect to his varied activities, a very all-around phase was about to begin.

In 2014 he was posthumously awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations by Israel's institute of Holocaust remembrance Yad Vashem.  Biography  Kolkman was born on 1 December 1896 in The Hague. Until the German invasion of France, Kolkman worked as a journalist for the newspapers De Telegraaf and Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant in Paris. Shortly thereafter he was sent to the city of Perpignan in Vichy France to serve as vice-consul. During the war he used his possibilities as a diplomat to help Dutch refugees, many of them Jewish, by finding them safe houses, providing them with financial aid and rescuing them from concentration camps. This enabled them to get to safety in Spain and Portugal, from which they could cross to England. Many of his actions were illegal, including the forging of documents. He is estimated to have saved hundreds of persons. In early 1943 Kolkman tried to flee by crossing the Pyrenees into Spain, he was however arrested by German patrol units. In 1944 Kolkman died in the Buchenwald concentration camp, although other sources mention Majdanek. A plaque remembering Kolkman is placed next to the entrance of the building of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2014 he was posthumously awarded the title Righteous Among the Nations.

It is located at an elevation of .  History  The exact date of the foundation of the castle is unknown. Whilst older sources often plump for a construction date immediately following the building of the Barbarossaburg in Kaiserslautern in 1156, more recent sources tend to lean towards a date about 50 years later. The pentagonal bergfried and the massive shield wall in particular point to a construction date of around 1200. In the first half of the 13th century the castle was enfeoffed to a Kaiserslautern family of ministeriales, the descendants of Reinhard of Lautern, the knight. In 1214, they were awarded the right of patronage of Ramstein by the king, Frederick II, who would later become emperor. From then on the castle's owners called themselves von Hohenecken. A barony belonged to the castle, which covered several villages: the valley settlement of Hohenecken at the foot of the castle hill (Burgberg) as well as Erfenbach, Espensteig, Siegelbach and Stockweiler, today Stockborn. All have since become part of the city of Kaiserslautern. Castle and barony were an imperial fief for centuries. At the beginning of the early modern period, Hohenecken Castle went into decline. In the German Peasants' War of 1525 it was captured by rebellious peasants. In 1668 there was a lengthy siege by Prince-Elector Charles Louis of the Palatinate, which ended in the partial destruction of the castle. In 1689, during the War of the Palatine Succession, the castle was blown up by French troops.  Layout  Including the outer ward, moat, upper and lower wards, the castle measures about 50 by 9 metres in area. It has a mighty shield wall (25 m wide, 11 m high) and a pentagonal bergfried. The castle is considered by experts to be one of the best examples of castles from the Hohenstaufen period. Today it is a popular attraction and offers extensive views.

It was founded as the Jewish Communist Party in Bielorussia () on January 19, 1919. The Jewish Communist Party of Bielorussia functioned as an autonomous unit of the Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Bielorussia. In the wake of the October Revolution, the issue of the integration of the General Jewish Labour Bund into the communist movement was unsolved. The Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RCP(b)) opposed the notion of an independent Jewish communist movement, preferring territorial communist organizations. The Bund, on the other hand, demanded to retain an autonomous organization, the same demand it had put forth at the time of its entry into the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In Bielorussia, however, conditions were somewhat different. Soviet rule was weaker and there was a division within the Communist Party. Thus the Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Bielorussia (CP(b)B) was more flexible towards cooperation with Jewish socialist groups than the RCP(b) at large. In December, the Kombund (communist faction of the Bund) and the Jewish Section of CP(b)B agreed to set up a joint organization and presented this suggestion to the Central Committee of the CP(b)B. They argued that the Jewish proletarians, due to their 'specific conditions', ought to have a Communist Party of its own albeit in union with the RCP(b). On January 15, 1919, the CP(b)B approved of the merger between Kombund and the CP(b)B Jewish Section. Four days later, the Jewish Communist Party of Bielorussia was founded with representatives from both parties forming the Central Committee. Some 2,000 Bundists joined the new party. Most of the party members were former Bundists. The first party congress was held in Minsk on February 28, 1919. The congress resolved to work for the establishment of an All-Russian Jewish Communist Party, which would function as an autonomous unit of RCP(b). The name was changed to Komfarband (reflecting the creation of the Lithuanian‚ÄìBelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic) and a new Komfarband Central Committee was elected. Two-thirds of the delegates were former Bundists. Der shtern was the organ of Komfarband. The RCP(b) did not approve of the Komfarband, and instructed the CP(b)B to eliminate it. On June 26, 1919, the CP(b)B Central Committee issued a memorandum announcing the dissolution of Komfarband.

He was a cousin of John Butler, 6th Earl of Ormonde, although little is known of his own parents. The Butlers had backed the losing side in the Wars of the Roses , and Ormonde's brother James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormonde had been attainted and executed for treason as a result, but the 6th Earl was quickly pardoned by the new King Edward IV, who greatly admired him. Ormonde may have recommended his cousin as a royal servant: in 1478 Butler was groom of the King's chamber, while his wife Agnes was described as \\"former nurse to the royal children\\". He was also bailiff of the manors of Solihull and Yardley. In 1492 he was sent back to Ireland as Master of the Rolls in Ireland. It is unclear what legal qualifications, if any, he had for the office. The Master of the Rolls at that time was not always a qualified lawyer, as his duties were primarily administrative. His appointment was part of a campaign by the new Tudor dynasty to curb the power of the Anglo-Irish gentry, which included nearly all the judges, who had openly backed the pretender Lambert Simnel and were now suspected of aiding another pretender, Perkin Warbeck. Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, who had once been all-powerful in Ireland, was disgraced and between 1492 and 1494 those judges who were regarded as his creatures were removed. From 1496 on Kildare quickly regained much of his influence, and Butler resigned or was removed from the Mastership of the Rolls in that year. His date of death is not recorded. References *Ball, F.

It documents the band's last ever live performance under the Fishmans name. The show was recorded and filmed at Akasaka Blitz on December 28, 1998, and was first released on September 29, 1999 by Polydor Records in Japan. The album title roughly translates to \\"A Men's Farewell: December 28th, 1998\\", a reference to the tour name and to bassist Yuzuru Kashiwabara's departure from the band and to signal the \\"end of an era\\" for the band's three piece era. The performance was released on DVD under the name \\"Áî∑ÈÅî„ÅÆÂà•„Çå 98.12.28 @Ëµ§ÂùÇBlitz\\" in 2005. The album has garnered much underground acclaim.  Background  On December 28, 1998 on the last day of the Áî∑ÈÅî„ÅÆÂà•„Çå tour, Fishmans would perform their final concert at Akasaka Blitz. While initially meant to be a farewell to bassist Yuzuru Kashiwabara who would be departing from the band, it would rather be a farewell to frontman Shinji Sato and to Fishmans as a whole, as Sato would suddenly die months later. Performance Fishmans performed a multitude of their most beloved songs and singles, including \\"„Å≤„Åì„ÅÜ„Åç\\", \\"„ÅÑ„Åã„Çå„Åü Baby\\", \\"„Éä„Ç§„Éà„ÇØ„É´„Éº„Ç∏„É≥„Ç∞\\", \\"Melody\\", \\"Walking in the Rhythm\\", and \\"„ÇÜ„Çâ„ÇÅ„Åç in the Air\\". They also played their sixth studio album Long Season in its entirety as the finale. The concert showed the band's progression stylistically from playing music heavily influenced by reggae and dub, to finishing their career playing dream pop and neo-psychedelia.  Underground recognition  While Fishmans received only scarce international recognition during their active years, 98.12.28 Otokotachi no Wakare has become lauded among several online music communities. Rating aggregate website RateYourMusic has made the album chart in the top 100 albums of all time, as well as the second-best album of 1999. It is also the highest-rated live album of all time.

There is no monetary authority or central bank in Tuvalu. The NBT performs some monetary functions for the government, including the holding of government accounts and foreign assets. The NBT is the only institution in Tuvalu that provides foreign exchange transactions. The NBT buys and sells foreign exchange at rates determined by the board of the NBT, which takes account of the rates quoted in the international markets. The NBT cashes travellers cheques. There are no credit-card facilities or ATMs available in Tuvalu. The Tuvaluan dollar is not an independent currency, but a variation of the Australian dollar. Tuvalu began issuing its own coins in 1976, which circulate alongside Australian coins, and Tuvalu continues to use Australian banknotes. Establishment The NBT was established as a corporate body under the National Bank of Tuvalu 1980 as a subsidiary of Barclays Bank. In 1985, it became a joint venture between the government of Tuvalu, which held 60% of the shares, and Westpac, which held the remaining 40%. In 1995, the government acquired Westpac's shares. The headquarters of the NBT are at Vaiaku in Funafuti, and agencies are operated on all eight outer islands. Constitution The National Bank of Tuvalu 1980 states that ‚Äúthe Bank shall act in accordance with any policy directions in the national interest given to it from time to time in writing by the Minister [of Finance]‚Äù. NBT has a board of directors consisting of the secretary for finance and four others (excluding members of Parliament) appointed by the minister for periods determined by the minister. The board is required ‚Äúto ensure that Bank policy is directed towards the national interest and has due regard to the stability and balanced development of the economy of Tuvalu.‚Äù The board appoints a general manager for a term of up to 5 years. The general manager must attend board meetings but has no voting rights. Operations In 2001 the NBT employed two managers (finance and administration, and lending and operations) and 38 officers, clerks, and tellers. In 2009 staff levels of the NBT were 45 employees. The TNB‚Äôs deposit rates are low by regional standards, and lending rates are the same or above the rates charged in more competitive banking systems. Between 1990 and 2000 the NBT operated profitably, returning an average 58.3% on net assets before tax and contributing an annual average of $507,000 in company tax and dividends to the government. Earnings on foreign exchange transactions are a major source of income. In 2001 loans and advances were around 28% of total deposits, reflecting the limited opportunities for domestic lending and conservative reserves management. The level of operations in the first quarter of 2001 resulted in A$1.2 million in new lending: 58% of personal loans were for family commitments, including funeral, wedding, and birthday expenses; 29% for travelling; and 11% for education; with the remaining 2% being advances to seamen. The NBT has maintained its profitable as of 2008. A review by the Asian Development Bank, related to an ADB facility for the government of Tuvalu recommended that the NBT implementation prudent fiscal discipline to improve liquidity. The changes including the repayment by the government of Tuvalu of an overdraft of around A$5 million in respect of which the bank has a foregone interest of approximately A$500,000 per year. Tuvalu joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 24 June 2010. The IMF 2014 Country Report noted the NBT had restricted its exposure to public enterprises and made substantial provisions in relation to debtors. Effective of 7 October 2016, Tuvalu accepted the Article VIII obligations of the IMF Articles of Agreement, to maintaining an exchange system free of restrictions on payments for international transactions. Other financial institutions in Tuvalu Loans are available from the Tuvalu National Provident Fund (TNPF), which is owned by its members and has the legal form as a mutual fund rather than a body corporate owned by shareholders. The TNPF invests social contributions from slightly more than half the country‚Äôs population, with payments from the TNPF made on retirement. The Development Bank of Tuvalu (DBT), which began in 1993, is also owned by the government of Tuvalu. The DBT provides development loans.

Two methods have been used: the original penalty stroke competition is a best-of-five penalty strokes with sudden death if scores were level after five strokes. An alternate penalty shoot-out competition was introduced at major tournaments in 2011. Sometimes known as a penalty shuffle, the method is similar to penalty shots in ice hockey and consists of one-on- ones between an attacking player and a goalkeeper. Up to 2013, up to two 7.5-minute golden goal periods were played first; that method ceased after. Penalty stroke competition (before 2011) To determine matches that end in a tie, a penalty stroke competition was used. Similar to a penalty shoot-out in association football, teams alternately take penalty strokes, subject to the normal rules, to determine the winner. Each team is represented by any five players chosen from the team sheet submitted prior to the match and the order in which they participate is also chosen. Players from each team take alternate strokes in a best-of-five competition until a team has won or 10 strokes have been completed. The goal used is selected by the umpires and the team to take the first penalty stroke is determined by a coin toss. In the result of a tie after 10 strokes, the same players will continue to take strokes in a sudden death format until a winner is established. The order in which players take stokes may change and the team that started first in the shoot-out goes second for the duration of sudden death strokes. Penalty shoot-out competition (since 2011) Similar to a penalty shot in ice hockey, the attacker gets a chance to run with the ball in a one-on-one situation against the goalkeeper. The attacker starts on the 23-metre line with the ball and the goalkeeper starts on the goal line. When the whistle is blown, both can move and the attacker has 8 seconds to score a goal. Unlike a penalty stroke or penalty corner there are no restrictions on strokes the attacker may use to score and a goal is scored in the usual way. If the attacker commits an offence, the ball travels outside the field of play, or 8 seconds elapse before the ball crosses the line a goal is not awarded. If the goalkeeper unintentionally fouls the attacker then the penalty shoot-out is re-taken; in the event the foul was intentional a penalty stroke is awarded. Just like its predecessor, the penalty shoot-out uses five players chosen from each team against a goalkeeper. It is a best-of-five competition and, if scores are tied at the end of this, it progresses to sudden-death with the same players until a winner is established. Which goal to use is chosen by umpires and which team starts is determined by a coin toss. Sudden-death is started by the team that did not start the shoot-out and players may proceed in a different order from the best-of-five. History The first Olympic match to be decided by a penalty stroke competition was during the 1972 Summer Olympics in the 11th place classification match when Poland defeated France. Following the introduction of women's hockey to the Olympics in 1992, the first Olympic women's penalty stroke competition was at the 1996 Summer Olympics and decided the bronze medal match between Great Britain and the Netherlands. However, penalty strokes had already long been used in the Women's Hockey World Cup which started in 1974; notably, the winner (West Germany) of the 1981 final was determined by this method. Penalty shoot-outs using a one-on-one had previously been trialled in the Australian Hockey League since 2001. Alternate tie-breaking methods were also tested; these including a trial in domestic Australian leagues where an extra time situation was used where \\"players from both teams are reduced gradually\\" after a fixed amount of time--the idea being that this creates space for a goal to be scored. The Euro Hockey League used shoot-outs since its inaugural 2007-08 season and that year's match for third- place was determined using a shoot-out. The International Hockey Federation's view was that the shoot-outs \\"better replicate real game situations and tend to require more skill\\" and were a better method of tie-breaking. In April 2011, the International Hockey Federation announced that a penalty shoot-out competition would replace the penalty stroke competition and the first major tournament to feature this tie-breaking procedure was the 2011 Women's Hockey Champions Challenge II; the first penalty shoot-out occurred in the 3rd place match with Belarus defeating Chile 3-1 in the shoot-out. The second shoot-out was used to determine the 3rd place match in 2011 Women's Hockey Champions Challenge I. The Champions Trophy is the premier annual hockey tournament and the first time a shoot-out was used in the competition was to determine the winner of the women's 2011 tournament; Netherlands won the shoot-out 3-2 against Argentina. The first Olympics to feature the penalty shoot-out was London 2012; they were not required in the men's tournament but was used once in the women's tournament where the Netherlands progressed from their semi- final against New Zealand.

The route passes through many of Midlothian's historic towns and villages. The gentle gradient and nature of the route allows easy access for walkers, cyclists and horse riders to explore and enjoy the spectacular landscapes and visitor attractions of the county.http://www.sustrans.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/penicuik_to_dalkeith.pdf Former Rosslyn Castle station Route From the car park in Penicuik follow the signage crossing the Bowstring Bridge through Beeslack Wood then cross the Firth viaduct. This bridge has 10 arches, is 66 feet high and each arch spans 35 feet. Roslin Glen Country Park will soon be reached followed by the disused Rosslyn Castle station. Shortly after this the route passes the small town of Rosewell then after a mile or so Bonnyrigg is reached. A few miles further on, after crossing over the A7 road, the outskirts of Eskbank are reached and the route continues past Eskbank Railway Station towards Dalkeith. It is, of course, possible to do the walk in the opposite direction. The route used to go through Eskbank and over the Glenesk viaduct and finish close to the A720 City of Edinburgh bypass. This section followed the trackbed of the old Waverley Line, which forms part of the Borders Railway which opened in September 2015. Nearby attractions Many of Midlothian's places of interest can easily be reached from this walkway. These include: Rosslyn Chapel, The National Mining Museum, Dalhousie Castle, Newbattle Abbey, Ironmills Park, Dalkeith Country Park, and Dobbie & Co's Butterfly World. Flora and fauna Following the closure of the railway in 1967, nature has created an intricate wildlife corridor with a diverse range of habitats. A carpet of ferns, rushes and mosses dominates the embankments, while open verges are ideal for grasses and wildflowers. Buddleia, a butterfly favourite, readily colonises vacant spaces on walls and old platforms. The River North Esk meanders through the Esk Valley, flowing into the Firth of Forth at Musselburgh. At one time polluted by Midlothian's industrial past, the river now is home to a rich variety of wildlife, including the shy otter and the exotic-looking kingfisher. Pioneer species, birch and willow are the first to colonise open areas such as railway embankments. Both can live up to 100 years. At Beeslack Woods, 200-year-old oaks dominate the tree canopy. Oak and ash have been the most successful species within the river valley at Roslin Glen for over 400 years. At one time, this ancient seminatural woodland covered most of Midlothian. All these woodland habitats create a haven for wildlife.

Most of her works appeared under the pseudonym David Lyndsay. In private life she used the name Walter Sholto Douglas. This may have been partially inspired by her grandfather's name, Sholto Douglas, the fifteenth Earl of Morton. She was a close friend and confidante of Mary Shelley, and lived a portion of her life as the husband of Isabella Robinson. In 1980, scholar Betty T. Bennett sensationally revealed that Dods performed both male identities for various literary and personal reasons. Early Life Apparently the illegitimate daughters of George Douglas, the sixteenth Earl of Morton, Mary Diana Dods and her older sister Georgina were raised at two residences, one being Dalmahoy House, the seat of her father's Scottish estate, and the other being in London. Education The literary success of works published under her male pseudonym of David Lyndsay suggests that Dods had received a substantial education. Education for women was better in Scotland than in England in the 19th century, but still paltry. At most, women learned basic etiquette and household upkeep from hired governesses. Mary's education is attributed to the Scottish parish school system. Unlike Edinburgh University, parish schools educated both sexes. Another theory is that Mary's father was wealthy enough to provide additional domestic tutors. Another supporting detail in Bennett's research is a letter from Lyndsay to her publisher claiming an education under the \\"best Masters\\".Bennett p. 94. Work Some dramas of hers appeared in Blackwood's Magazine, as were several of her stories, which have been seen as \\"very much in the vein of Byron's Oriental tales\\".Bennett, p. 229, note 83. Dods, communicating as Lyndsay, admitted to admiring Byron for his writing, but adamantly denied that she plagiarized from his work. Lyndsay had at least six contributions published in Blackwood's Magazine. Those confirmed include \\"The Death of Isaiah ‚Äì a Fragment\\"; \\"Horae Gallicae. No. I. Raynouard's States of Blois\\"; \\"The Mount of Olives, The Plague of Darkness, The Last Plague\\"; \\"The Ring and the Stream\\"; and \\"Vigil of St. Mark\\". Another key work was Dramas of the Ancient World, written at William Blackwood's invitation, which appeared in 1822 as written by David Lyndsay.Geraldine Friedman: \\"Pseudonymity, Passing, and Queer Biography: The Case of Mary Diana Dods\\", √ârudit, No. 23 (August 2001) Retrieved 8 January 2017. Tales of the Wild and the Wonderful (1826, Littel) was also published pseudonymously, with support from Lyndsay's close friend Mary Shelley. This contributed to the then-current popularization of German fairy-tales. During her lifetime Dods, under the pseudonym David Lyndsay, rose to the higher literary circles of both England and France. There is evidence that she was acquainted with General Lafayette, Lord Byron and Frances Wright. She published pseudonymously for reasons explained to her father in a letter of 26 June 1822: \\"I sometimes, about once a quarter, write a criticism for the Reviewers upon some popular work, any that happen to be the fashion, for which, I am esteem'd one of the cleverest and keenest of that race of Vipers. I am paid tolerably well, ten Guineas per sheet, but this not under my own name. I dare not acknowledge the Fact lest the angry Authors whose works I am compelled to maul in the course of my vocation should return the compliment and maul me in return.\\" Writing as an ostensibly male author in the Victorian era of England's history gave Dods invaluable freedom. As a young woman her wealthy father had often ignored her petitions for money ‚Äì her sister Georgiana was typically given a larger sum, and more often.Bennett p. 193. This shows that Mary's father did not trust her financial responsibility in the same way as her sister's, a limitation which kept both young women in perpetual debt. The debt receipts and bills, however, provide much evidence for the research on Mary in relation to her false personae ‚Äì Lyndsay and Douglas. Writing as Lyndsay, Mary developed her literary ingenuity and avoided the constraints of working in the more socially acceptable role of a governess.Bennett p. 218. Through her writing she began to reach into the literary circles of Lord Byron and Mary Shelley. The letters of Mary Shelley, the original focus of Bennett's research, reveal details of both the male identities Dods adopted in her life and career. Identity Dods's original pseudonym was David Lyndsay, for the purpose of supporting herself as a writer while living with her sister Georgiana Carter. Carter's husband died soon after their marriage and the sisters lived together in London. In August 1821, the first of many letters appears between Lyndsay and the publisher of Blackwood's Magazine, William Blackwood.Bennett p. 43. As Lyndsay, Dods received criticism and praise for her published work in the magazine. She was recognized as a good, well-read writer by the magazine's critics. In 1822, letters began to make mention of a liver disease that occupied Lyndsay and prevented her work from being completed on time.Bennett p. 49. These correspondences reveal some biographical detail. Dods, writing as Lyndsay, relates details such as her Scottish heritage, her linguistic prowess, and the fact that she is a good critic of theatre performance.Bennett p. 47 and 49. The connection between Dods and her male persona is clear: Dods was noted as linguistically gifted in her social spheres, and fluent in French, German, Italian, Latin, and Spanish. Other small details support the relationship; both Dods and Lyndsay in separate letters relate a difficult and demanding relationship with their father.Bennett p. 103. =Second identity= Dods also lived under the male identity of a diplomat and scholar whom she named Walter Sholto Douglas, ostensibly the spouse of one Isabella Robinson and a friend of Mary Shelley. The marriage was concocted in part as a veil for Robinson's illegitimate pregnancy. When the child was born, Dods and Robinson named the little girl Adeline Douglas; when she married Henry Drummond Wolff in 1853, Adeline cited her late father as \\"Walter Sholto Douglas\\". Correspondence between Dods and Jane Williams in the mid-1820s suggests they too had close relations.Charlotte Gordon: Romantic Outlaws (New York/London: 2015), Chapter 35, notes 28‚Äì30. Retrieved 7 January 2017. In 1827 Shelley helped Dods and Robinson obtain false passports, enabling them to travel to Paris under the identities of Mr and Mrs Douglas. In the description of Douglas for the passport, \\"he\\" is said to be short, with dark curly hair and dark eyes. In a book by Eliza Rennie, biographer of Mary Shelley, Dods is described similarly: \\"very sharp and piercing black eyes, a complexion extremely pale and unhealthy... her figure was short... (Dod's hair) cropped, curly, short, and thick.\\"Bennett p. 93. Rennie adds that at first glance, Dods appears as \\"someone of the masculine gender\\". However, these similarities support rather than prove the identity. In another section of her book on Shelley, Rennie writes, \\"'Miss Dods' was an alias for Mr. ---.\\" This provides strong confirmation that Rennie knew the alternate identities of Dods.Bennett pp. 93‚Äì94. Letters between Mary Shelley and literary acquaintances intimate similar truths about Dods' identity. Because Shelley corresponded with both Lyndsay and Dods, the obvious similarity in their handwriting confirms a single writer.Bennett p. 61. One telling clue comes in a letter Shelley wrote with a large blank space originally indicating to critics that she had simply discontinued one sentence and begun another. However, the phrase is continuous and states, \\"pray console dear Doddy for [blank space] she is very sorrowful & has reason to be so.\\"Bennett p. 77. Reading the rest of Shelley and Lyndsay's letters in hindsight, and other letters to literary friends, Bennett confirms the female identity of both Douglas and Lyndsay. =Moustache and whiskers= Later in life Dods suffered further attacks of liver disease, and other unnamed mental and physical illnesses. There is no definite evidence as to whether the relations between Dods and Isabella were romantic, but that is not impossible either. The decline in Dods' mental and physical wellbeing coincided with separation from Isabella for some substantial time. After a lifetime of financial struggle and debt, Douglas ended in a debtor's prison. While there she asked a friend to have a moustache and whiskers brought to her, in the contemporary style. This indicates less a preoccupation with keeping up the male identity than Dods's need for one. Living as a woman had not worked for her and she was undergoing ruin as a man.Bennett p. 227. Dods is thought to have died of her ailments between November 1829 and November 1830, after several months in prison. Legacy Lady Adeline Douglas Wolff's secret stories of how her mother Isabella Robinson's first \\"husband\\" switched genders for literary and personal gain might have appealed to her own daughter, the rebellious author Adeline Georgiana Isabel Kingscote, who published several of her first novels under the male pseudonym Lucas Cleve.

The company was active from 1919 until 25 August 1923 when Giovanni amalgamated it with 'Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino (S.C.A.T.), which he had founded in 1906 and left in 1917, to form SCAT-Ceirano. Ceirano family background The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R. / Rapid (Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" was also influential, co- founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building Welleyes bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the Welleyes motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C. which in 1903 became Societ√† Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Societ√† Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Societ√† Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \\"Ernesto\\" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA). History  1924 Ceirano Giovanni and Ernesto sold their main share-holding in S.C.A.T. in 1917, and in 1919 Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili's new range was based on the pre-war (1914) S.C.A.T..

He was a deputy from 1815 to 1824, and was Minister of Justice in three successive cabinets from 1818 to 1821. He sat on the center-right, but had liberal views on press freedom, direct elections and the use of juries. Early years Pierre Fran√ßois Hercule de Serre was born in Pagny-sur-Moselle, Meurthe, on 12 March 1776. His family originated in the Comtat Venaissin, but had become established in Lorraine. His father was Fran√ßois-Louis de Serre, a former cavalry officer, lord of the fief of Coureol, and Barbe-Marguerite de Maudhuy de Beauharnais. Hercule de Serre was destined for a career in the army, and studied at the School of Artillery at Chalons-sur-Marne. During the French Revolution (1789‚Äì98) he emigrated and served in the Army of Cond√©. He did not return to France until 1802. He studied law and was admitted to the Bar of Metz, where he distinguished himself. Napoleon appointed him Advocate General of Metz on 23 February 1811, then first president of the Imperial Court of Hamburg on 14 July 1811. Deputy Hercule de Serre supported the Bourbon Restoration, and was appointed First President of the Court of Colmar in January 1815. He accompanied King Louis XVIII to Ghent during the Hundred Days (March‚ÄìJuly 1815) when Napoleon returned from exile. On 15 August 1815 he was elected deputy for Haut-Rhin. He sat with the majority, supporting the government. He proposed, unsuccessfully, an amendment to the draft law on suspension of individual liberty. He defended General Andr√© Mass√©na against a petition demanding action against him. He also opposed the conclusions of the report of Kergolay on the return of unsold goods to the clergy. He was closely aligned with the views of Pierre Paul Royer-Collard. De Serre was reelected on 4 October 1816 and on 20 September 1817. He sat with the majority, and in January 1817 was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies, replacing √âtienne-Denis Pasquier. He held this position until the end of 1818, when he was replaced by Auguste Ravez. He tended to favor direct elections, but opposed the requirement to reelect members appointed to permanent offices, and approved the suspension of individual liberty. As Speaker, he proposed a new regulation of severe penalties for interruptions. Minister of Justice Bust of Hercule, Comte de Serre, in Pagny-sur-Moselle, Lorraine, France On 30 December 1818 de Serre accepted the Justice portfolio in the Ministry of Jean- Joseph Dessolles. After agreement with Royer-Collard and the main Doctrinaires, he presented three new press laws establishing freedom from prior censorship, the competence of the jury even for minor offenses, and the admission of testimonial proof against officials. These proposals were attacked by the royalist right, and were not passed. On the other hand, he alienated liberal opinion when he said that the Charter of 1814 applied to voters; temporary exiles could still hope to return to France; but regicides never. This extreme statement was later modified to allow that the king could grant clemency for age and infirmity. De Serre retained his position in the Ministry of √âlie Decazes, formed on 19 November 1819. De Serre agreed with √âlie Decazes when he wanted to change the electoral law. He did not follow his colleagues in their retreat after the assassination of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. He remained Minister of Justice in the Second ministry of Armand- Emmanuel du Plessis de Richelieu. After a stay in Nice to recover his health, at the end in April 1820 he resumed the struggle against the opponents of the proposed electoral law. The opposition was led by the Doctrinaire group and Royer-Collard. De Serre did not hesitate to eliminate his old friend from the Council of State. He recommended that magistrates apply the utmost rigor against \\"revolutionaries\\". Later career De Serre refused to join the Ministry of Joseph de Vill√®le and was succeeded as Minister of Justice by Pierre-Denis, Comte de Peyronnet on 13 December 1821.

Biography Jane Swain Adams was born in Toodyay, Western Australia on 28 February 1851, the second of four children of Scottish-born farmer Charles and his wife Jane Mary ( Cameron) Glass. A young Jane Adams married cobbler Charles Frederick Adams on 6 November 1868. The Adams originally established a farm at Yarragin, then in 1875 they moved to Mangowine, near Nungarin the furthermost east of any settler at that time where they built the Mangowine Homestead. In 1887 Adams commenced keeping meteorological records, a task she continued until her death in 1934. With the discovery of gold at Yilgarn in 1888, Charles built an inn at the homestead, which Jane ran until Mangowine was bypassed by the rail line from Northam to Southern Cross. They closed the inn in 1893. Charles died in 1895, and Jane continued to run the farm providing fresh produce for travellers and railway workers. She successfully tendered for the mail run in 1896, with their son Charles as the mail man. In early 1900s more settlers took up farming in the region; many of these people were inexperienced in farming the tough conditions, and they turned to Adams for help and advice. The town of Nungarin was established in 1910. In 1929 Adams was the guest of honour for the opening of the Barbalin Water Scheme. Adams died on 9 November 1934 at Mangowine, and was buried in the Nungarin Cemetery. In 1935 a memorial was erected in her memory.

It spans , stands about above the river, and its arches rise above the roadway. It rests on poured concrete abutments that have a light Art Deco or Moderne styling. Wing walls recede from the abutments into the banks in three stepped sections. Below the bridge in the river is visible some riprap, stone remnants of the old bridge's abutments and central pier. The bridge is of a \\"tied arch\\" design, in which the two arches are joined together by ties to distribute the active load. This is in contrast to the Justice Harlan Fiske Stone Bridge joining Brattleboro, Vermont and Chesterfield, New Hampshire, which was built about the same time, and distributes the active load to its abutments. The bridge components were manufactured by the American Bridge Company; construction was by Hagen-Thibodeau Construction Company at a contracted cost of just over $209,000. The bridge is named for Samuel Morey, an early inventor of steamships and resident of both Orford and Fairlee. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

This plant and the Chute-Allard Generating Station located upstream were put into service in 2008. The construction was completed in 2009. The hydroelectric plant of Rapides-des-Coeurs generates an output of 76 MW. The main dam is based on rockfill, located on the river. The intake has six sluices and six forced to feed six turbine/generator of SAXO type. The drop height is 22.50 m. The spillway is equipped with valves. Hydro-Qu√©bec provides management of ecological river flow.  Geography  The Rapides-des-Coeurs generating station is located 108 km (by road) at northwest of La Tuque, and the Chute- Allard at 120 km. Rapides-des-Coeurs is located at kilometre point 264 and 265 of the Saint-Maurice River, upstream of the R√©servoir Blanc. Before watering the basin, rapids extended over a kilometre. A rocky island was at 264.5 kilometre point. From La Tuque, access is via Route 25, until kilometer 60. From this intersection, an existing forest road due to forestry operations, leads to the right bank of Rapides-des-Coeurs after a journey of just over 27 km. The hydroelectric plant of Rapides-des-Coeurs is located northwest of the town of Windigo, in Upper Mauricie and downstream of the reserve Wemotaci. The area between the Rapides-des-Coeurs and Chute-Allard is part of unorganized territory of Rivi√®re-Windigo. In this sector, the forests are mainly part of public jurisdiction. The dam of Rapides-des-Coeurs creates a water reservoir stretching 20 km upstream up to the height of the railway station Vandry. The dam submerges an approximate land area of 2.2 km¬≤. The maximum flow rate of the water is estimated at 500 m¬≥/second. The average annual energy produced is of the order of 460 GWH. The electricity produced by the Chute-Allard and Rapides-des-Coeurs is integrated into the network of Hydro-Qu√©bec. A line of 230 KV with an approximate length of 60 km connects the positions of these two plants in the central position of Rapide-Blanc Generating Station, located downstream on the Saint-Maurice River. A temporary bridge crossing the Saint- Maurice River, just upstream of the ‚ÄúRapides-des-Coeurs‚Äù was used during the construction period of the dam.  History  Upstream from the village of Windigo, the Saint-Maurice river had two long rapids: \\"Les Grands Coeurs\\" and \\"les petits Coeurs\\". They were both very dangerous for the loggers. The harnessing of the river took place in this zone.Article \\"Notes to serve the historical geography of Mauricie\\", compilation by Dollard Dub√©, mentioning the two rapids of the Hearts\\". In April 2005, the provincial and federal authorities have authorized the completion of the hydro-electric project in the Chute-Allard and central Rapides-des-Coeurs. The construction of facilities began the same year. For the simultaneous construction of Chute- Allard and Rapides-des-Coeurs, a common camp for the accommodations for workers was built on a site already cleared by forestry activities. This camp was located at 28 km from the site of the Chute-Allard and 47 km from the site of Rapides-des-Coeurs. The construction of this plant has required the relocation of the Canadian National Railway segment nearly for a mile on the south side of Saint-Maurice River, downstream of the plant. In addition, a segment of more than 400 meters from the railway line was enhanced and in some places the embankment of the railway has been strengthened. In 2008, the ‚Äúbiefs‚Äù (areas submerged by the dam) of the Chute Allard and Rapides-des- Coeurs were watered respectively from 6 to 9 May and August 4 to 22. Commissioning of the latter electric group plans took place on 14 August 2009 for the Chute-Allard Generating Station and October 23, 2009 at the Rapides- des-Coeurs.

Glessner created The Rocks as a private conservation initiative, to prevent destructive farming methods from destroying the land. The large Shingle-style house he had built in 1883 no longer stands, but a significant number of outbuildings survive, including a carriage house, horse barn, and a sawmill/pigpen building in a cluster of buildings located generally northward of the former house site. At least three of these buildings were designed by Chicago architect Hermann V. von Holst, and are of unusually high quality in their design and construction. There is a subsidiary area of the estate known as the Red Farm, centered on a c. 1840 farmhouse. The estate was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The property is now owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests and is open to the public.

He won bronze in the 1934 European Championships, competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics and at one point ranked second on the all-time world list. Biography Sule was born in Tartu on 10 September 1910. In 1928 he set Estonian high school records not only in the javelin, but also high jump and pole vault. Before Sule the Estonian record in the javelin was Aleksander Klumberg's 63.32 from 1921; starting in 1930, Sule broke the record six times officially and twice unofficially. In 1931 he threw 69.54, ranking him second in the world that year behind former world record holder Eino Penttil√§. Sule remained one of the world's top throwers in 1932, improving his Estonian record to 69.62. He would have been a medal contender in the Olympic Games in Los Angeles, but the Estonian Olympic Committee didn't have enough money for the long trip and Sule, like other Estonian athletes such as Arnold Viiding, had to stay home. Sule failed to improve his Estonian record in 1933, but his best throw of 69.30 still ranked him fourth in the world that year. At the 1933 International University Games in Turin he won the silver medal, losing to Hungary's J√≥zsef V√°rszegi but defeating Germany's Gottfried Weimann, who had placed fourth at the Olympics. Sule broke through the 70 m barrier in 1934, improving his Estonian record to 71.48 and again placing second on the annual world list. At the inaugural European Championships that summer, also held in Turin, he threw 69.31 and placed third behind the top two from the 1932 Olympics, Finland's Matti J√§rvinen and Matti Sippala; he was named Estonia's top athlete that year by the Tallinn Sports Press Club. Sule failed to regain that shape for the next two years, only ranking sixteenth on the world list in 1935 and eleventh in 1936, although he still won a bronze medal at the 1935 International University Games. He competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, but only managed 63.26 and an eleventh place. In 1937 he again broke the Estonian record twice, throwing 72.72 in August and 73.31 in October, and ranked fourth on that year's world list. Sule set his eventual personal best in Tallinn on 20 June 1938, throwing 75.935 m.Measured with half-centimetre accuracy. Sometimes given as 75.93 m with only full centimetres used. At the time, that was enough to place him second on the all- time world list, behind only world record holder J√§rvinen; Yrj√∂ Nikkanen pushed him down to third when he twice broke the world record later that year, but Sule stayed in the all-time top five until 1953. At the European Championships in September 1938 he threw 70.50 m and placed fourth behind J√§rvinen, Nikkanen and V√°rszegi, beating his Estonian teammate Friedrich Issak by one place. Between 1928 and 1940, Sule was Estonian champion nine times in the javelin and once in the high jump, and won minor medals in the pole vault, shot put, hammer throw and decathlon.

The town center is located on terraces on the west bank of the Pemigewasset River, with its commercial core extending along Main Street (United States Route 3). The town common is an oval bounded on the east by Main Street, where commercial buildings face it, and the west by Post Office Square, where the buildings of the historic district are arrayed. Its most prominent feature is a fountain, depicting a Boy Scout kneeling with cupped hands to hold water; it was designed by George Borst, a summertime resident of Plymouth, and placed in 1933. It was here that the town's first colonial meeting house was built, on whose site the 20th- century Congregational Church now stands. Just to its north stands Plymouth Town Hall, built in 1890 to a design by New Hampshire architect C. Willis Damon to also serve as a county courthouse.

Career and Research  As a postdoc he was a lecturer at the University of Virginia. From 1986 he was at McMaster University and since 1999 he is a professor at the University of British Columbia. He developed the technique of lace expansion (originally introduced by David Brydges and Thomas C.

In 1989 Slade proved with Takashi Hara that the Aizenman‚ÄìNewman triangle condition at critical percolation is valid in sufficiently high dimension. The Hara‚ÄìSlade result has important consequences in mean field theory.Hara, Slade The triangle condition for percolation, Bulletin of the AMS, vol. 21, 1989, pp. 269‚Äì273 In 1991 Slade and Hara used the lace expansion to prove that the average distance covered in self-avoiding random walks in 5 or more dimension grows as the square root of the number of steps and that the scaling limit is Brownian motion.Hara, Slade Critical behaviour of self- avoiding walk in five and more dimensions, Bulletin of the AMS, vol. 25, 1991, pp. 417‚Äì423 =Honours and awards= Slade was an invited speaker in 1994 at the ICM in Z√ºrich with lecture The critical behaviour of random systems.

During his second tenure he took care of aligning church administrative practice and canon law with the contemporary needs, and took measures to replenish the patriarchal coffers. He was also in contact with Western potentates, including Pope Paul V and King Philip III of Spain, whom he urged to engage in a crusade to liberate the Orthodox Christians from the Ottoman Empire, going as far as to make considerable concessions to the doctrine of the Catholic Church, including recognizing papal primacy. His pro-Western policy and financial exactions made him many enemies, including Cyril Lucaris, who succeeded in securing his deposition in October 1612.

Cilthriew ( now referred to as Kerry Farm) provides free short breaks for disabled people and their families in a farm surrounding. History In the Middle Ages Cilthriew was one of the townships in Kerry. The township is also referred to as Kilroith or Kilroyth. Richard Williams makes the claim that Cilthriew and the neighbouring house of Brynllywarch (which was also a township) were in the ownership of the Pugh (ap Hugh) family from at least 1500.R Williams Montgomeryshire Worthies, Newtown 1884, 112.

William Pugh of ‚Äò‚ÄòKilthrew‚Äô‚Äô was the Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1767 and his son William, who was also Sheriff of Montgomeryshire in 1813, became a very successful attorney and purchased the Caer Howell estate in Montgomery.Williams, pg 112. William Pugh died in 1823 and is buried in Kerry Church His son was the notable William Pugh, an entrepreneur, who did much to develop trade and infrastructure in the Montgomeryshire Severn valley. He paid for the final extension of the Montgomery Canal from Berriew to Newtown, and for various road building schemes including a road from Abermule along the Mule valley. In Newtown he encouraged the growth of the textile industry and was responsible for the Flannel exchange, designed by Thomas Penson. In 1828 he sold the Caer Howell estate, using the proceeds to develop Brynllywarch. For this work he may have employed T G Newnham and J W Poundley as his architects and surveyors. His schemes were over ambitious and in June 1835 he fled to Caen in Normandy to escape his creditors.Williams, pg 114-5. This resulted in the Brynllywarch and Cilthriew estates, which then consisted of 27 farms, being sold in 1839 to Richard Leyland (Bullin), a very wealthy banker from Liverpool. Leyland was to give these estates, together with the Leighton Hall Estates to his nephew John Naylor in 1846.http://www.leightonnews.com/2013/the-history-of-the-naylor- family-of-leighton-hall/ The very detailed survey of the estates purchased by Leyland and later John Naylor, drawn up by J W Poundley, is now in the National Library of Wales.http://cat.llgc.org.uk/Brynllywarch estate [cartographic material] : first and second purchases from William Pugh Esqre. in 1839 and 1840 / [by J.

Architectural description Originally a ‚Äò‚Äòsub-medieval‚Äô‚Äô timber-framed house of Peter Smith‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄòLobby Entrance Houses‚Äô‚Äô dating to the later years of the 16th century.Peter Smith ‚Äò‚ÄòHouses of the Welsh Countryside‚Äô‚Äô, Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, 2nd edition, 1988,pp 155‚Äì173, figs 79‚Äì80 The house is orientated NW-SE on a flat recessed area before a rising hill (as the Welsh name Cil-Rhiew would appear to suggest). A porch on the NW side suggests that this was a standard ‚Äò‚Äòlobby-entrance‚Äô‚Äô house and there is a large rectangular stone chimney stack which is placed directly in front of the entrance, originally forming a lobby. Stellar chimney stack,Cilthriew.The chimney stack, consisting of three brick chimneys of stellar form, is a fine example of type that occurs in the last two or three decades of the 16th century in this area. Peter Smith in Houses of the Welsh Countryside has mapped the occurrence of these chimney stacks (including Cilthriew), which are distributed mainly in North West Wales, along the border with England.Smith 471, Map 32 ‚Äò‚ÄòOrnate‚Äô‚Äô door opening cut into wall-plate. Cilthriew, Kerry. The existence of an ornate doorhead cut into a wall plate at 1st floor level, may represent an early alteration to the house.‚Äò‚ÄòSmith‚Äô‚Äô 505, Map 41, this example is not noted ‚Äì the earliest example given by Smith is 1599 Major alterations were made in the late 18th century or more probably in the 1840s, when Cilthriew was acquired by the Brynllywarch Estates. The house was transected by two stone wings (at right angles and aligned NE-SW) which override the earlier timber-framed structure. The timber-framed structure survives within the stone wings, but it was then chopped off to the off to the SW.This is at complete variance with the Cadw listing details, which does not appreciate that for most of Montgomeryshire, timber framing pre-dates the use of stone for walls.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-17306-cilthriew-kerry When the house was altered it was re-roofed with very fine massive tun slates above the eaves and with graduated slates up to the ridge. This is a very rare survival of a technique common in the 18th century, but in this case it may later. At the N E in the angle between the timber framed house and the stone wing is a slightly sunken room, described as a ‚Äò‚Äôcellar‚Äô‚Äô, but almost certainly a dairy, as it would have been ideal for cooling milk. Brick ranges have been added to the SW with a doorway and a dormer with two arched windows above. This has been done in a ‚Äò‚ÄòTudoresque ‚Äò‚Äô or Jacobethan style and must be contemporary with the carved bargeboards on the gables and shaped brackets on either side of an upper chamber window on the timber framed section. These additions give Cilthriew a Cottage orn√© appearance suggesting that it is the work of an estate architecture, working for the Naylors, most probably John Wilkes Poundley, who published \\"Poundley‚Äôs Cottage Architecture\\" in 1857.J D K Lloyd, John Wilkes Poundley: A Montgomeryshire Architect, ‚Äò‚ÄòMontgomeryshire Collections‚Äô‚Äô 65, 1977,47‚Äì56.

Roger Williams, a physician and pharmacist. She studied at Emerson Institute, Mobile and graduated from Talladega College in 1922. She earned a B.A. in Music at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee (1926), after which she went on to the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, from which she received another B.A. in Music with a major in piano and a minor in voice (1928). During the summers, Williams continued her musical studies with bandleader Fred Waring and at Columbia University. In 1936 she married Joaquin M.

Career Williams's ambition was to be a concert pianist but lack of opportunities drove her into teaching music. She began her teaching career as director of music at North Carolina College for Negroes in Durham (1926‚Äì32) and subsequently taught at Dunbar High School in Mobile (1932‚Äì1936), at Fessenden Academy in Florida (1936‚Äì1937), and at Lincoln Academy in Kings Mountain, North Carolina (1938‚Äì39).Roses, Lorraine E., and Ruth E.

In 1939, Williams became the first supervisor of music in the Mobile public school system, a job she held until her death in 1973. Ariel Williams Holloway Elementary School in Mobile was named in her honor. Between 1926 and 1935, Williams published five poems in Opportunity, one of the leading journals of the Harlem Renaissance, and other poems in Crisis: A Record of the Darker Races. She also published a single volume of verse, Shape Them into Dreams (Exposition Press, 1955). \\"Northboun',\\" a short poem in dialect about the Great Migration, has been called her \\"signature poem\\" and \\"one of the best poems of the period.\\" Its haunting refrain underlines one of the major continuing divides in American culture: > O' de wurl' ain't flat, An' de wurl' ain't roun', H'it's one long strip > Hangin' up an' down‚Äî Jes' Souf an' Norf; Jes' Norf an' Souf. ‚Äîfrom Ariel > Williams Holloway, \\"Northboun'\\" \\"Northboun'\\" won an important prize in Opportunity (where it was first published in 1926) and has been collected in several anthologies, including Golden Slippers (1941), edited by Harlem Renaissance poets Countee Cullen and Arna Bontemps, and Lorraine E.

Founded in 1932, its completion was funded by the estate of Cecil John Rhodes, after whom it is named and whose summer home is located on the main site. The school is modelled after the traditional British public school in terms of system, structure and traditions due to its deep English roots.  Overview  The School Hall. This is where assembly, celebrations and special occasions take place. Inside is a stage, grand piano and projector used during stage plays. The school admits boys from the ages of 8‚Äì12 (Grades 3 to 7) on basis of academic, musical and/or sporting merit. Some boys are required to take an entrance examination, but most enter directly and follow the school's curriculum. Originally, the school only admitted white pupils but following the dissolution of Zimbabwe Rhodesia and Zimbabwean independence in 1980, its student body soon diversified. However, the school maintained its low acceptance rate and merit-based admissions system. During the 20th Century, the school was recognised as one of the most prestigious of its kind in Zimbabwe and maintains that reputation to-date. Almost all pupils (known as REPS boys) gain entry to top private secondary schools in Zimbabwe. Most boys go on to excel at such schools as, Brother school, Plumtree High School, Falcon College, Christian Brothers College, Bulawayo, and Watershed College. Recently, however, a large number of REPS boys attend secondary schools abroad. The boys are famous for being competent rugby players and cricketers and its alumni includes Henry Olonga, his brother Victor Olonga and Heath Streak. Each year, the school produces at least one Matabeleland Duikers U13 Rugby player, the greatest honour in Matabeleland at that level of play. This is the chapel where all Sunday services are held. During the spring term, however, the boys are required to attend service on some Wednesday evenings and on the last Friday of the term.  School terms  There are three academic terms in the year: * Summer term, from early January to late March. This is when most new boys are admitted to the school. * Winter term, from early May to late July. Few boys are accepted during this term. * Spring term, from early September to mid December. No boys are accepted during this term. At least once every term, boys have an exeat weekend which allows them to return home between Friday and Sunday, before normal timetable is resumed the following Monday. = Summer term = The summer term usually commences one week after each new year. During this term, new boys (known as \\"lighties\\") join the school whilst existing boys progress to the next grade, which requires moving into a new dormitory house (\\"dorms\\"). Unlike the other two terms, all boys must take part in compulsory cross country running every morning and sometimes in the afternoon too. Junior boys (grades 3 and 4) complete a 3 kilometre course known as the \\"sadac\\" because its route winds around SADC headquarters, while senior boys (grades 5 to 7) take a longer route colloquially referred to as the \\"dip tank\\" which is approximately 5 kilometres. Most boys participate in track and field athletics and long- distance running, with few taking part in racquet sports such as tennis. The daily uniform in summer consists of short-sleeved khaki shirts, khaki shorts, knee-length grey socks, veldskoen chukka boots and, on weekends, a safari hat. This is worn to lessons, the dining hall, and during social time but is substituted for full colours for Sunday chapel service. = Winter term = This is the most popular term for two key reasons. Firstly, this is the biggest sporting season insofar as the boys play rugby (or \\"rugger\\") every week and is the term during which trials for Matabeleland Duikers U13 rugby take place. Rugby is a very popular sport at REPS, with over half the boys taking part to form the First, Second and Colts teams. The First team plays at a competitive level, often defeating local schools such as Whitestone School and Petra Junior School and faring well in the coveted Falcon College Junior Rugby Festival. Those boys not taking part in rugby are encouraged to do other sports such as gymnastics which, although less popular, attract a fraction of the school's population. The daily uniform is altered in winter to match the weather conditions: boys wear their summer gear but without the safari hat and may wear a grey sweatshirt with purple lining and/or the school's purple jacket, but not blazer, purple gloves and the school's scarf. Unlike the other two terms, there is one exeat weekend in winter, often in the second week of June. = Spring term = Spring term is often confused for the summer term due to similar weather conditions. However, unlike the summer term, this is the official cricket and swimming term (whereas in the summer term both sports are merely for physical education purposes and leisure). The school has an outdoor pool located opposite the dining hall and hostels and adjacent to the classrooms. REPS boys often take part in swimming gala events in central Bulawayo against other schools where they often come in the top three. Cricket is more popular, however, with boys doing it for both leisure and competitive purposes. The school often produces two cricket teams ‚Äì the seniors and juniors ‚Äì which usually compete against schools in Bulawayo and Beitbridge, its most popular rivals being Centenary and Masiyephambili Junior School, against whom it shares a long-standing rivalry. It is during this term that senior boys (Grade 7) sit their external 11+ exams and the rest of the school sit internal assessment tests. Three REPS boys wearing full sports colours at a swimming gala in 1992.  Houses  There are two types of house at REPS; sporting house and dormitory house. There are six dormitory houses: * Victory (Grade 3) * Nelson (Grade 4) * Rodney (Grade 5.I) * Vanguard (Grade 5.II) * Ajax (Grade 6) * Warspite (Grade 7) And two sporting houses: * Falcons * Eagles *Hull *Cecil = Dormitories = The six dormitories share similar cultures and amenities, the key difference being cohort. All dormitories have a hall monitor and a prefect to supervise the boys, selected by senior staff and the headmaster and are responsible for overseeing the boys' daily performance and welfare. New boys board at Victory, where they are \\"trained\\", before progressing to Nelson the following year. There are two Grade 5 dorms, Rodney and Vanguard, which house different types of boy based on performance and behaviour in Nelson and are traditional rivals. Each dorm houses approximately 15 students each year, depending on the school's intake. The school's hostel which houses the six dormitory houses. = Sports = There are two sporting houses, Falcons and Eagles, which compete in inter-house competitions in mainly sport, but also chess and drama. Membership is determined at the start of each year (during the summer term) and is not fixed i.e. what house you belong to changes every year. Falcons and Eagles are rivals in the following sports: * Rugby * Cricket * Swimming * Athletics * Tennis  Uniform  REPS Boys wearing full colours at the end of term. There are two main types of uniform ‚Äì full colours and daily colours. = Full colours = Full colours are worn on occasions such as Sunday Service, Leavers' Dinner, Celebration Day, the Christmas Meal, at the end of term and on exeat weekends. Full colours consist of the school's blazer; a white shirt; the school tie; grey trousers or shorts (depending on season); knee-length grey socks; black shoes; and the school cap. REPS Boys are known for their purple cap, known as the \\"REPS cap\\" which is worn with full colours. The colours are not only worn for ceremonies and occasions, but whenever students are representing the school in competitions, trials and inductions too. For example, when a REPS boy is selected for the Matabeleland Duikers team, he is invited to the induction ceremony where he'll be expected to wear full colours with or without the cap. In recent times, however, the head boy and his deputy wear full colours on a daily basis to distinguish themselves from the rest of the students. REPS boys at the grave of Cecil John Rhodes wearing full colours. = Daily colours = Daily colours vary per term but usually consist of a short-sleeved khaki shirt, khaki shorts, knee-length grey socks, and chukka boots. This is worn to the classroom, the dining hall, on weekends, and during social hours. The key differences between summer and winter daily colours are that a green safari hat is often worn in summer (instead of the cap) and the school's sweatshirt, gloves and scarf may be worn during the winter term. In wet seasons, the boys may be allowed to wear Wellington boots instead of chukka boots.  Teaching  Informally known as \\"the quads\\", this is the learning area with classrooms for Grades 3‚Äì7 and a computer room. During exams time (spring term), the area remains open to senior students until 7pm. On average, there are 10 students per class, with up to three teachers per class teaching different subjects. The school's curriculum is varied and very intense. Junior boys (Grades 3 and 4) follow a curriculum consisting of: * English (spoken and written) * Mathematics (mechanical and mental) * Religious Studies * Social Studies * Landforms & Maps * History of Africa * IT * IsiNdebele * Home Economics This changes once the boys reach Grade 5. They stop learning Home Economics, and History of Africa, which are substituted for new subjects: * Science * Music or Drawing * World history The school follows the Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (ZIMSEC) Grade 7 syllabus and senior boys (Grade 7) sit these exams in the spring term for entry to secondary school.  Prefects  Head boy: the school's head boy is selected at the end of every spring term. Competition is usually fierce, with a large number of nominations for the position. Existing prefects nominate students they consider outstanding for consideration by senior staff (the headmaster, senior teacher, and teachers) who then eliminate weaker candidates until there are two left. The final determinant is usually academic performance in end of year tests, sporting excellence, leadership potential, discipline and smartness. The head boy is the most senior student in the school and is responsible for ensuring that all boys follow the school's rules and prefects do their duties. At the Leavers' Ball, the head boy is expected to deliver a speech to the parents, special guests and the rest of the boys which is often written in conjunction with his deputy. Deputy head boy: the deputy head boy has similar responsibilities to the head boy, the only difference being his subservient role in the head boy's presence. The deputy head boy is head of dorm at Ajax, which means he oversees the development and welfare of Grade 6 students. Senior prefect: the senior prefect is the most senior of prefects, responsible for assisting the head boy and his deputy, as well as looking after senior boys, their discipline and welfare. The senior prefect and head boy are heads of dorm at Warspite, the Grade 7 dorm. Monitors: also known as \\"dorm monitors\\", these boys are responsible for making sure that dormitories are well looked after, the boys are well behaved and deal with any bullying claims. Monitors at Victory House are responsible for the \\"training\\" and induction of new boys, which involves acquainting them with the school's rules, values, and culture. However, each dorm has two monitors. The student body have some say in the leadership body; if one of the boys above abuses or misuses their power and authority, it is in the boys' interest to report them to the teachers who can then take appropriate action, which is usually to demote them.  Hall  The exterior of the Hall. This is where all meals are eaten in silent, and an area open to the boys only during mealtimes. Dining Hall, or simply \\"Hall\\", is a central part of the boys' life. This is where they have all five meals of the day: * Breakfast ‚Äì Between 07.00 and 07.30 * Elevenses ‚Äì Between 10.00 and 10.15 * Lunch ‚Äì Between 12.30 and 13.00 * Afternoon tea ‚Äì Between 15.30 and 14.00 * Supper ‚Äì Between 18.00 and 19.00 Inside the school's dining hall. Table allocation is random, but every year group is usually represented on each table. Before breakfast, lunch and supper, the bell is rung five times which is a cue for the boys to gather outside. All boys are required to queue silently outside the Hall before being called in by the senior prefect. They are expected to walk in silence and stand behind their seats before saying grace. After this, the boys will be asked to sit down by the teacher in charge before eating in silence. Before each of these meals, all boys repeat the meal prayer: \\"For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful. Amen. After all meals, senior boys will delegate duties to junior boys of; clearing everyone's plates, cleaning the table and ensuring the surrounding area is clean. On exeat weekends, end of terms, and Christmas Meals, boys are required to wear full colours to Hall. The tables are often re-arranged, with white cloths on each table, waiter service and a three-course meal is served. Instead of electrical lights, end of term dinners and the Christmas Meal are candle-lit affairs, often followed, or preceded, by chapel service. Every year, the boards in the Hall are updated. There are three main boards inside: Honoris Causa, First XI, and First XV recognitions. The Honoris Causa board includes names of distinguished scholars who have contributed to the school's development either academically, musically or in sport whilst the First XI and XV boards are reserved for names of captains of cricket and rugby teams respectively.

No. 22b, the building involved in the siege, is to the left. The Balcombe Street siege was an incident involving members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and London's Metropolitan Police lasting from 6 to 12 December 1975. The siege ended with the surrender of the four IRA members and the release of their two hostages. The events were televised and watched by millions.Devon & Cornwall Constabulary Historical Videos ‚Äì Devon & Cornwall Constabulary Background Scott's restaurant in 2005, the attack on which preceded the siege In 1974 and 1975, London was subjected to a 14-month campaign of gun and bomb attacks by the Provisional IRA. Some 40 bombs exploded in London, killing 35 people and injuring many more. In one incident the Guinness Book of Records co- founder and conservative political activist Ross McWhirter was assassinated; he had offered a ¬£50,000 reward to anyone willing to inform the security forces of IRA activity.1975: Balcombe Street siege ends BBC News \\"On this day\\": 12 December 1975 The four members of what became known as the \\"Balcombe Street gang\\", Joe O'Connell, Edward Butler, Harry Duggan and Hugh Doherty, were part of a six-man IRA Active Service Unit (ASU) that also included Brendan Dowd and Liam Quinn. Quinn had recently shot dead police constable Stephen Tibble in London after fleeing from police officers. The flat he was seen fleeing from was discovered to be a bomb factory used by the unit. The Balcombe Street siege started after a chase through London, as the Metropolitan Police pursued Doherty, O'Connell, Butler and Duggan through the streets after they had fired gunshots through the window of Scott's restaurant in Mount Street, Mayfair. They had thrown a bomb through the restaurant window a few weeks before on 12 November 1975, killing one person and injuring 15 others. The Met's Bomb Squad had detected a pattern of behaviour in the ASU, determining that they had a habit of attacking again some of the sites they had previously attacked. In a scheme devised by a young detective sergeant, the Met flooded the streets of London with plainclothes officers on the lookout for the ASU. The four IRA men were spotted as they slowed to a halt outside Scott's and fired from their stolen car. Inspector John Purnell and Sergeant Phil McVeigh, on duty as part of the dragnet operation, picked up the radio call from the team in Mount Street as the stolen Ford Cortina approached their position. With no means of transport readily available, the two unarmed officers flagged down a taxi cab and tailed the men for several miles through London, until the IRA men abandoned their vehicle. Purnell and McVeigh, unarmed, continued the pursuit on foot despite handgun fire from the gang. Other officers joined the chase, with the four IRA men running into a block of council flats in Balcombe Street, adjacent to Marylebone station, triggering the six-day standoff.\\"The Road To Balcombe Street\\", Dr. Steven Moysey, Haworth (2007) Purnell was subsequently awarded the George Medal for his bravery. (Note: article title refers to another individual, not Purnell) Several other police officers were also decorated. The siege The four men went to 22b Balcombe Street in Marylebone, taking its two residents, middle-aged married couple John and Sheila Matthews, hostage in their front room. The men declared that they were members of the IRA and demanded a plane to fly both them and their hostages to Ireland. Scotland Yard refused, creating a six-day standoff between the men and the police. Peter Imbert, later Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, was the chief police negotiator.Balcombe Street gang's reign of terror BBC News. Accessed 26 August 2007 The men surrendered after several days of intense negotiations between Metropolitan Police Bomb squad officers, Detective Superintendent Peter Imbert and Detective Chief Superintendent Jim Nevill, and the unit's leader Joe O‚ÄôConnell, who went by the name of \\"Tom\\". The other members of the gang were named \\"Mick\\" and \\"Paddy\\", thereby avoiding revealing to the negotiators precisely how many of them were in the living room of the flat. The resolution of the siege was a result of the combined psychological pressure exerted on the gang by Imbert and the deprivation tactics used on the four men. The officers also used carefully crafted misinformation, through the BBC Radio news‚Äîthe police knew the gang had a radio‚Äîto further destabilise the gang into surrender. A news broadcast stated that the British Special Air Service were going to be sent in to storm the building and release the hostages. This seemed to deter the gang and they eventually gave themselves up to the police. Trial The four were found guilty at their Old Bailey trial in 1977 of seven murders, conspiring to cause explosions, and falsely imprisoning John and Sheila Matthews during the siege. O‚ÄôConnell, Butler and Duggan each received 12 life sentences, and Doherty received 11. Each of the men was later given a whole life tariff, the only IRA prisoners to receive this tariff. During the trial they instructed their lawyers to \\"draw attention to the fact that four totally innocent people were serving massive sentences\\" for three bombings in Woolwich and Guildford.Joe O'Connell's speech from the dock Despite telling the police that they were responsible, they were never charged with these offences and the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven remained in prison for 15 more years, until it was ruled that their convictions were unsafe.Innocents jailed over bombings BBC News Release After serving 23 years in English prisons, the four men were transferred to the high security wing of Portlaoise Prison, County Laois, in early 1998.
