The station is owned by Riviera Broadcasting, an affiliate of the Yucaipa Companies. Its studios are located on 7th Street in Midtown Phoenix, while its transmitter is located in Crown King, Arizona (producing a rimshot signal from 50 miles northwest of Phoenix). History 95.1 went on the air in 1996, licensed to Winslow, broadcasting from Mingus Mountain and covering areas of Northern Arizona. It was owned by Ted Tucker's Desert West Air Ranchers Corporation. Tucker moved the station in 2000 to the Crown King site (along with a change of city of license to Mayer, later changed again to Sun City West) and sold it in 2004 to Sun City Communications for $18.7 million. The new ownership flipped KFMR from a simulcast of Tucker's KCDX to the Hispanic rhythmic (\\"hurban\\") format as KVIB \\"The Vibe\\". As The Vibe, KVIB played a youth- oriented radio format playing both Spanish-language and English-language pop. The station's mix of music targeted the Valley's burgeoning young Latino population, particularly long-time residents who can speak English but prefer Spanish. On January 23, 2014, KVIB changed their format to Spanish adult contemporary, branded as \\"Solamente √âxitos\\" with a bilingual presentation.KVIB Phoenix Shifts to Spanish AC On August 13, 2014, at noon, 95.1 flipped to Soft AC as 95.1 The Oasis, and nine days later, the station became KOAI. The last song of the Spanish AC format was \\"Royals\\" by Lorde with the first song on The Oasis being Cool Change by the Little River Band.

On April 9, 2015, 95.1 gained an FM translator, K235CB 94.9 on South Mountain (licensed to Chandler), and also began simulcasting on the HD2 subchannel of KEXX. In May 2015, KOAI adjusted its playlist to include more uptempo selections from the 1990s through the present time, while still retaining a gold/soft AC-lean. On June 5, 2015, while it was still a soft AC station, KOAI picked up Delilah's radio show. Delilah continued on the station through two additional format changes, first to a traditional adult contemporary station, and then to classic hits. Delilah was dropped on August 25, 2017 in favor for more music. On September 30, 2019 at 5PM, after playing \\"Addicted to Love\\" by Robert Palmer, KOAI changed their format from classic hits to a new format concept for baby boomers developed by veteran radio programmer John Sebastian, blending pop, rock, soul, and country from a seven-decade span and branded as \\"The Wow Factor\\".

It was written by Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield, as the culmination of a series of attempts to codify civil law in Argentina. The original code was approved on September 25, 1869, by the passage of Law 340, and became active on January 1, 1871. With numerous subsequent modifications, it continued to be the foundation of Argentine civil law (Derecho civil argentino) for more than a century. On 1 August 2015, the Civil Code of Argentina was replaced by a new Civil and Commercial Code - C√≥digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci√≥n. V√©lez S√°rsfield's code reflects the influence of the continental law and liberal principles of the 17th century. It was also influenced by the great Napoleonic code, the Spanish laws in effect at that time in Argentina, Roman law (especially through the work of Savigny), canon law, the draft of the Brazilian civil code (Esbo√ßo de um C√≥digo Civil para Brasil) by Freitas, and the influence of the Chilean Civil Code (by Andr√©s Bello). Approval of the Argentine civil code was necessary for judicial reasons and political reasons. It gave a new coherence and unity to civil law. The civil code's authority over provincial law improved the inconsistent existing legislation throughout the country at the time. This unity and coherence would bring two important benefits: it would facilitate both the people's knowledge about the law, as well as its application by judges, the legislation would also strengthen the political independence of the country, through legislative independence and national unity. In spite of the stability brought by the civil code to the Argentine law system, it was subject to various modifications throughout its history, as was necessary to adequately regulate a society undergoing significant social, political and economical changes. The most important reform was Law 17.711 of April 22, 1968. Not only did the law change around 5% of the complete article, it is especially important due to the change in orientation regarding some regulated institutions. There were also other reform projects that were not implemented. Along with proposals to change institutions and methods, one of them proposed to merge the civil code with the commercial code, following the example of the Italian code. After decades of deliberations, a new C√≥digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci√≥n was approved in 2014, and entered into force in 2015, replacing the old code.  Precursors  During the Justo Jos√© de Urquiza administration many projects were driven forward. The codification in Argentina was part of a process being undertaken around the world, due to the advantages that such a systematic approach granted. Indeed, there had been earlier codifications; those completed toward the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century had a strong influence on the compilation of the Civil Code of Argentina. Stemming from these, there were separate attempts at civil codification in the Argentine republic during the first half of the 19th century, but it was finally achieved in 1869. The unification of the country and its political growth and strengthening demanded the codification of the civil laws, since it was not possible to continue under the uncertainty caused by the inadequate code that existed under the rule of the Spanish. Before the Civil Code, there had been several attempts to this effect, without success. In 1824, Juan Gregorio de las Heras issued a decree appointing one commission charged with compiling the Commercial Code and another charged with compiling the Military Code, but neither of these two projects' efforts came to fruition. In 1831, the Legislature of Buenos Aires adopted the Spanish Commercial Code compiled in 1829 and created a commission to see to any reforms to it that might be necessary. In 1852, Justo Jos√© de Urquiza created a commission of 14 members for the compilation of the Civil, Penal, Commercial and Procedural Codes. However, the revolution of September 11 of that year, which resulted in the secession of the Province of Buenos Aires from the Argentine Confederacy, prevented this project from making any concrete progress. The Argentine Constitution of 1853, in clause 11 of article 67, authorized the Argentine National Congress to draw up the Civil, Commercial, Penal and Mining Codes. With the intent of fulfilling this constitutional mandate, Facundo Zuvir√≠a brought before the Senate a law that would empower the Executive Branch to appoint a commission to complete those tasks. The law was passed and signed by Urquiza, but for financial reasons the initiative was postponed. In the State of Buenos Aires, an initiative to launch a Civil Code suffered the same fate. On October 17, 1857, a law was passed that authorized the Executive Branch to spend the necessary funds to compile the Civil, Criminal and Procedural Codes, but the initiative was ultimately frustrated.Zorraqu√≠n Bec√∫ (1952). ps. 60 y ss. However, the Commercial Code had better luck. The task of compiling that code had been given to Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield and Eduardo Acevedo Maturana, who sent it to the legislature for its approval. The Commercial Code of the State of Buenos Aires was finally passed in 1859, and it was this code that was adopted at the national level in 1862 and amended in 1889. = Legislation in force prior to its sanction = Front page of the Siete Partidas. Until the sanction of the Code, the Argentine legislation was based on the Spanish legislation previous to the May Revolution, and on the one called Legislaci√≥n Patria (Native Legislation). The Spanish legislation in use in the country was the New Compilation of 1567, since the Newest Compilation of 1805 did not have application before the revolution. The New Compilation contained laws coming from the Fuero Real (Royal Jurisdiction), the Ordenamiento de Alcal√° (the Code Law Reordering of Alcal√°), the Reordering of Montalvo and the Laws of Toro. In order of importance: *1st New Compilation, *2nd Fuero Real, *3rd Fuero Juzgo, *4th Fuero viejo de Castilla (Old Fuero of Castile), *5th the Partidas. Nevertheless, the Siete Partidas (Seven-Part Codes) were more often applied due to their prestige, the extension of the addressed matters, and the further knowledge of them by judges and lawyers. The Legislaci√≥n Patria was composed of the laws sanctioned by the provincial and national governments. These laws were of considerably less importance compared to the Spanish legislation and weren't altered, confirming the principle according to which the political emancipation lets endure the previous private Law until the new State arranges otherwise, in exercise of its sovereignty.Cabral Texo (1920). p. 1. The primary national laws were the liberty of wombs (Libertad de Vientres) and of the slaves entering the territory (1813), the suppression of entailed states (mayorazgo) (1813) and of emphyteusis (1826), and the suppression of gentilic retract (1868), that gave the right to re-acquire family real estate sold to a stranger to the nearest relative of the original vendor (up to the 4th grade of kinship). Other various laws and provincial decrees modifying different institutions existed, as the emancipation by age rating (dictated by Buenos Aires on November 17, 1824, by Tucum√°n on September 1, 1860 and by Entre R√≠os on March 10, 1866); the determination of domicile in the main estate (dictated by Buenos Aires on September 16, 1859), about books of births, matrimonies and deaths, being the parish priests in charge (dictated by Buenos Aires on December 19, 1821, by Jujuy on September 7, 1836 and by Santa Fe on May 17, 1862); about restrictions and limits to the domains (dictated by Buenos Aires on July 27, 1865, by Jujuy in February 1855 and March 7, 1857, and by C√≥rdoba on August 27, 1868); and of the renting of fields (dictated by Santa Fe on July 31, 1837).  Sanction  Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield, editor of the Civil Code Argentina had been attempting without success to join the codifying movement in vogue at that time in some of the world's most powerful nations. The creation of the code would bring several advantages to the legislation that was at that time characterized by its dispersion, and consequently, its difficult implementation. The new system would provide mainly a unity and coherence to the civil legislation, and thus it would help it to be known and applied. There were also reasons of judicial nationalism that were motives for its creation, since it was considered necessary to reaffirm the political independence obtained decades before through legislative independence. The legislation most influential on Argentine law was until then the Spanish legislation, sanctioned centuries before, primarily because national law had minimal influence on private law. Finally, the sanction of a code was hoped to become an efficient instrument for the consolidation of the national unity that had been expensively obtained only a few years earlier. The unification could have been damaged if the provinces had kept their own laws, or had independently sanctioned new ones to fix the inadequacies in the Spanish one instead of doing it in an unified way. On June 6, 1863 Law No. 36, sponsored by deputy Jos√© Mar√≠a Cabral from Corrientes Province, was passed, which empowered the executive branch to appoint commissions in charge of writing the projects for the Civil, Penal, and Mining Codes and Military Ordinances. Even though the law allowed for the creation of commissions of several persons, president Bartolom√© Mitre decided to put a single person in charge, Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield, through a decree dated October 20, 1864. Victorino de la Plaza, president of Argentina, was one of V√©lez S√°rsfield's assistants. V√©lez S√°rsfield redacted the Project for the Civil Code without collaborators other than assistants that would transcribe his drafts. Among them were Victorino de la Plaza, who later would become president, Eduardo D√≠az de Vivar and V√©lez S√°rsfield's daughter Aurelia. For the task, V√©lez S√°rsfield withdrew to a country house he owned, located a few kilometers from Buenos Aires city, where he wrote the drafts that his assistants transcribed. The final transcript was delivered to the government for its printing, and was later destroyed. The drafts can currently be found at the Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba. As V√©lez S√°rsfield moved forward with his work, he would send it to the executive branch, which would then print and distribute it among the legislators, magistrates, lawyers and \\"competent persons, to allow them to study the work now and build an opinion of it for the time of its ratification\\".Decree dated June 23, 1865. Cabral Texo (1920). ps. 130. V√©lez S√°rsfield finished Book I in 1865, the first two sections of Book II in 1866, the third section of that book at the beginning of 1867, Book III in 1868, and Book IV in 1869, finishing the code after 4 years and 2 months of work. The project completed, President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento sent a note to the Congress on August 25, 1869 proposing the law that would ratify the project of the Civil Code. In the message, Sarmiento recommended immediate implementation, \\"entrusting its reform to the passage of future laws that will be enacted as experience dictates their necessity\\".Cabral Texo (1920), pp. 130ss The Chamber of Deputies approved the project on September 22, 1869 after rejecting various alternate version and objections to its being passed without amendment. The chamber determined that it would become effective on January 1, 1871. It then passed to the Senate, which ratified it on September 25, and it was promulgated by Sarmiento on September 29. The Project was closed-book endorsed, that is it was accepted without changes to the original, which according to Llamb√≠as did not require any debate: The endorsement of the Civil Code represented a great improvement over the previous legal regime, and fused modern advances in doctrine with local customs and active law.  Sources of the Civil Code  In his work on the Code, Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield was inspired by contemporary and older codes, by national and international law, and to a large extent by the prevailing doctrines of the period. These sources can be classified as follows: Roman law, Spanish and Argentine law, canon law, the Napoleonic Code and its commentaries, the work of Freitas, and various other minor sources. = Roman law = Roman law was not a direct influence on the civil code in the sense that none of its dispositions were directly extracted from the Corpus Iuris Civilis or from any Roman jurist's passage. Nevertheless, V√©lez S√°rsfield returned to the Roman criteria in some institutions' regulations, even those that hadn't been addressed by the contemporary codification. That was the case of property transmitted by \\"tradition\\", as opposed to the French code, which had changed it to transmission by \\"consentment\\". Moreover, among the notes of the codifier there are quotes of those laws, but they are second-hand references. The indirect Roman influence is reflected in the most part in the doctrines used by the author, especially as regards patrimonial structures. The main influence on the work of V√©lez Sarsfield was the German Romanist Friedrich Karl von Savigny with his work \\"System of the present Roman law\\" (System des heutigen r√∂mischen Rechts), used especially referring to legal entities, obligations, property and possession, and the adoption of the domicile principle as a determining element of the law, applicable to the people's marital status and capacity. = Spanish and native legislation = Once he finished the gathering process, V√©lez S√°rsfield was criticized for ignoring the Spanish legislation, which by the time was the one in effect in Argentina. One of these critics was Juan Bautista Alberdi, who was refuted by the modernizing critic and by V√©lez himself: The influence of this legislation regarding its method and technique was practically null, what can be understood due to the dispersion that characterized it. Nevertheless, on the material, and the sense and reach of the dispositions, V√©lez did make use of the old Right, adopting it to the new needs. The national legislation had little relevance on private law, though it did partially influence on the work of the Coder. Such is the case of the hereditary vocation of the article 3,572, whose antecedent is the law dictated by the legislature of the Buenos Aires Province dictated on May 22, 1857. V√©lez had also in mind the uses and customs of the country, especially regarding the family organisation. = Canon law = Canon law had a large influence over family law, especially in the area of matrimony. V√©lez S√°rsfield left matrimony under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church, taking the institution of canonical marriage and giving it civil effects. But the validity of matrimony was unchanged from the canonical version and the dispositions of the ecclesiastical courts, which would remain until the sanction of the law of civil matrimony. About this, V√©lez S√°rsfield expressed: This resolution by V√©lez S√°rsfield is explained by the uses and customs of that time, as it shows the sanction of a law of civil matrimony by the legislature of the Santa Fe Province in 1867: the law produced a popular reaction that ended with the resignation of the governor and the dissolution of the legislature house, which annulled the law when it was reconstituted. = Napoleon's Code = The influence of this code in the Coder movement proved very important, and the Civil Code of Argentina did not escape from this influence, being in a direct way or through his commentators. The direct influence can be shown in the 145 articles copied from the French code.Segovia (1933). T. 1, Introduction But the main direct influence of the commentators is that of the treta of Charles Aubry and Fr√©d√©ric Charles Rau, specially the third edition published in Paris between 1856 and 1858, of which the Coder took several passages that he used in around 700 articles.Segovia (1933). T. 1, Introduction, p. XX The work of Raymond Troplong provided the material for 50 articles related to the testament inheritance, and others for the real rights. From Jean Demolombe he took 52 articles for book IV and 9 for book III, from Chabot he used 18 articles for book IV, and from Zachariae 70 articles.Segovia (1933). loc. cit. = Freitas's work = The influence of Brazilian lawyer Augusto Teixeira de Freitas came from two of his works: the \\"Consolidation of the civil laws\\" (Consolida√ß√£o das Leis Civis) and his \\"Draft of a civil code for Brazil\\" (Esbo√ßo de um C√≥digo Civil pra Brasil). The ‚Äò‚ÄôConsolidation of the civil laws‚Äô‚Äô sorts in 1,333 articles the material of the Portuguese legislation, that contained the same dispersion present in the Spanish legislation in use in the Americas. His \\"Draft\\" was commended to him by the Empire of Brazil in 1859, but remained unfinished after completion of article 4,908, without reaching the inheritance section. In spite of this, it was one of the most frequently consulted works by V√©lez S√°rsfield; the first three books of the Argentine Civil Code contain more than 1,200 articles from the Draft. = Other sources = V√©lez S√°rsfield also used a number of different Codes and doctrine works that had a secondary influence in the Argentine Civil Code. After the French Code, the most influential code was the Chilean Civil Code,http://www.bcn.cl/leyes/pdf/actualizado/172986.pdf promulgated on 1855 and written by lawman Andr√©s Bello. That code was highly valuated by the Argentine Coder, and it is estimated that he based on it for the formulation of 170 articles of the Argentine code. He also made use of the Code of Louisiana, in which he based for the creation of 52 articles, of the Albertine Code for the Sardonic States, of the legislative Russian consolidation, the Code of Parma, the Code of Two Sicilies, the General Prussian Code of 1874, the Austrian Code of 1811, the Code of New York State and the Italian Code of 1865. V√©lez S√°rsfield made also use of the 1851 project for the Spanish Civil Code prepared by Florencio Garc√≠a Goyena. That project held 3,000 articles, and it's calculated that it helped in the formulation of 300 articles of the Argentine Code.Segovia (1933). Introduction, p. XIX. Finally, V√©lez used 27 articles from the 1851 project for the Uruguayan Civil Code by Eduardo Acevedo Maturana, as well as some references for his notes.  Structure  Method is of crucial importance in a codification work, due its systematic nature, and to the vastness of the subject. Hence it is important to regard and direct man's behavior through general and specific formulae that find their appropriate place among the assembled articles. V√©lez S√°rsfield dedicated much effort to the selection of an adequate method, and after receiving objections to the use of the methods of Justinian's Institutiones and of the French civil code, he decided to use the one followed by Freitas in his Consolida√ßao das Leis Civis, which finds its origins in the teachings of Friedrich Karl von Savigny. According to Freitas's ideas, it is convenient to commence a Code Law by the general dispositions, then address the ones referred to the subject of every legal relation (\\"the theory of persons\\"). But, as men don't live isolated but in their family's bosom, it must be continued with the Family law. Then the individual enters the civil life and establishes links person-to-person: the \\"obligations\\", or person-to-the-things submitted to him: the \\"real property\\". Finally it must be legislated about the theory of estate, with the \\"successions\\" and the \\"theory of privileges\\". To end, the institution of prescriptions, that, as referring to the rights as a whole, it was considered appropriate to locate it in a section inside the common dispositions to the real and personal rights. Thus, the Civil Code organisation is the following: *Preliminary titles: the Civil Code begins with two preliminary titles. The first title deals with the laws and elaborated a \\"general theory of the law\\". The second refers to the way of counting the intervals in law. *Book I: This book is dedicated to the people. Its first section \\"Of the people in general\\", deals with the persons themselves, and the second, \\"On personal rights in family relationships\\", with the family. *Book II: This book is divided into three sections. The first deals with the obligations in general and their limits. The second, talks about the judicial acts and doings that produced the acquisition, modification, transfer and lose of the rights and obligations. Finally, the third deals with obligations from contracts. *Book III: This book talks about real rights, dealing with things themselves, or in relation with the persons. *Book IV: This book contains a preliminary title about the transmission of rights in general. It then has three sections: the first about successions mortis causa, the second about privileges and right of keeping, and the third about prescription. = Fundamental principles = The compilation of the Civil Code was organized around a set of fundamental principles, which were based on ideas in vogue at the time of its compilation: *Sovereign will principle: The terms specified in contracts should be respected as if they were law, insofar as the exercise of a right would not constitute an illicit act. However, jurisprudence has established restrictions on this principle, as specified by Article 953, in the so-called \\"moral clause\\": \\"The object of legal compacts should be acts that are not contrary to respected custom.\\" *Responsibility based on fault: Civil responsibility was grounded in the idea of fault. Article 1067 establishes that no punishable illicit act exists where there has been no harm caused, or exterior action that could cause harm, and without the ability to impute Mens rea, fault or negligence to the actor. *Absolute right to property: The right of private property allows one to use, enjoy, and even destroy something owned, but there are certain limitations imposed on the reach of this right, and jurisprudence establishes restrictions, based on the aforementioned Article 953. The justification of the right to destroy property is established in the following note found in Article 2.513: \\"[...] But it must be recognized that with absolute right to property, comes the right to destroy property. Any preventive restriction would cause more harm than good. If the state acts as an arbiter of abuse, soon it will begin to act as arbiter of use, and any real notion of private property and liberty would be lost.\\" *Family grounded in indissoluble matrimony: Family law was grounded in the concept of indissoluble matrimony, and parentage was classified according to origin, either from within marriage or outside of wedlock. Children born out of wedlock were further classified as natural, from adultery, from incest, or sacrilegious. This framework excluded non-Catholics, who had only gained the right to marry in 1888, with the reform imposed by Law N¬∞ 2.393. = Notes by the Codifier = The Civil Code of Argentina has a unique feature, which is the inclusion of footnotes with the articles, in which V√©lez S√°rsfield explains the origin of, and principles governing, the positions adopted, sometimes citing or inserting laws and paragraphs from a source treatise. The presence of these notes stems from a request from the Ministry of Justice, that he annotate each article and its conformity to or divergence from laws currently in force in the country, as well as those of the major world powers. The notes are very valuable from a doctrinal standpoint. In them the codifier states the problem, summarizes the arguments and chooses a solution, always in a succinct manner. As a result, the Code became a veritable treatise on comparative law, which proved to be quite useful, as the bibliographic material available at the end of the 19th century was not plentiful. It is important to note that the footnotes contain numerous errors and even contradictions vis-√†-vis the article text, as can be seen in the text of articles 2.311 and 2.312 and the footnote to the former.In article 2.311 \\"things\\" are defined as \\"physical objects to which a value can be assigned\\", while the definition of \\"goods\\" in article 2.312 includes \\"things\\" and \\"nonmaterial objects to which a value can be assigned\\". However, in the footnote to article 2.311 the following is specified: \\"The word 'things', in its common flexible and imprecise usage, in fact encompasses everything that exists, not only objects that can be owned by a person, but everything in nature that cannot be owned in an exclusive manner: the sea, the air, the sun, etc. But as it pertains to private rights, we must limit the scope of the word to those privately held goods that can be assigned a value. Thus, all goods are things, but not all things are goods. A 'thing' is a generic type, and a 'good' is a subtype thereof.\\" Some of these errors are attributable to the codifier, but others are likely due to circumstances beyond his control. There are instances where V√©lez S√°rsfield reworked an entire title or modified a rule without altering the footnotes pertaining to the original edition. In this manner, for example, all the footnotes in Book IV were brought directly from the original drafts by Victorino de la Plaza without any of the pertinent modifications.Chaneton, Abel (1938). Historia de V√©lez S√°rsfield. Buenos Aires: Editorial La Facultad. T. 2, p. 149. That said, one should keep in mind that during the editing of Nueva York and La Pampa many modifications from the original text were accumulated.  Editions  The project drawn up by V√©lez S√°rsfield was printed as the author was sending the different books to the government. The first book was printed by the press called \\"La Naci√≥n Argentina\\"\\" (The Argentine Nation) in 1865, while the rest of the installments were printed by Pablo Cini in 1866, 1867, 1868 and 1869. During 1869 V√©lez trusted Coni with the reprinting of the first book, to maintain homegenity. This edition, known as the Buenos Aires edition, had many errors, and the numbering of the articles wasn't done with the work as a whole, but independently in every tome. This numbering method resulted very useful at the time of its writing, as the addition or suppression of new articles required minor touch-ups in the group of articles, but once printed was inefficient. Because of this, President Sarmiento insinuated to the codifier the necessity of making a new version that included the typos corrections. Vel√©z S√°rsfield accepted this proposition, and commended this correction work to his cousin Carlos Carranza through a letter: The printing was trusted by Sarmiento to the Argentine minister in Washington, D.C., Manuel Garc√≠a, while the rest of the task was given to the company Hallet Breen, who had quoted $2,000 less than other firms. This edition, renowned as the New York edition, maintained the numbering depending on each tome, and wasn't free of typos either.  Laws of Errata  President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento pressed for the correction of mistakes in the civil code. The first law of Errata was the law No. 527, that sanctioned what the Executive could propose for the new edition of the Civil College New York law, which could introduce a correction of 24 titles. This was necessary because when the first copies of this edition arrived in the country at the end of 1870, President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento's opposition took advantage of the modifications in the legal code sanctioned by Congress to initiate a media campaign against the government. For this reason Victorino de la Plaza and Aurelio Prado were appointed to compare both versions and report on the existing differences. While they were doing so, on January 1, 1871 President Sarmiento's decree declared the Buenos Aires edition to be official. In August of that year, Dr. de la Plaza and Dr. Prado reported that they had found 1,882 differences between the two texts, but due to the intrascendencia of many of these alterations, they concluded that the new edition of the code was not contrary to that sanctioned by Congress.Cabral Texo (1920). Ps. 241‚Äì249 However, public opinion was not amiable with this solution, as it declared official a text only nominally approved by the Congress and had a great amount of misprints besides. This last problem was what the senator for Tucum√°n Benjam√≠n Paz prepared to rectify, by means of a law project presented in 1878 that noticed 29 new errors. As this project passed through the commissions of the Chambers of Deputies and Senators, the number grew up as far as 285. This 285 errors are the ones that the Law No. 1196 corrects, sanctioned August 29, 1882, commonly known as the Law of Errata, though it was the second of its kind to be sanctioned. But all the corrections were not limited to merely formal adjustments: some of them introduced changes in the doctrine of the Civil Code edited by V√©lez S√°rsfield. This is the case of the alteration introduced in the article 325, in whom it was added as a requisite sine qua non the state of natural son to start an action of paternity after the father's death: The Law 1,196 also established the making of a new edition that included the corrections stated in that law. Abiding that disposition, in 1883 the third edition of the Civil Code was made, known as The Pampa edition for the name of the workshop who did the printing. This edition includes an important modification, being that the articles are number as whole. In 1900, President Julio A. Roca ordered a new edition that eliminated the articles revoked by the Civil Marriage Law and introduced the new dispositions without altering the numbering of the non- modified articles. At the end of the task, the project was sent to the national government, who in turn passed it to the Faculty of Law of the University of Buenos Aires to examine it. The Faculty designated a commission, who after the investigation determined that the project introduced reforms in the law doctrine. After asking for a competence extension, the Commission proposed this modifications in 1903, although the project was never dealt with by the Congress.  Reforms  The rationalist notion that all law should be condensed and comprehensively written in a code was challenged by social, economic and political mutations which imposed a need for the text to be constantly updated. One of the issues that divide the doctrine on this subject is the question of whether it is more convenient to make partial reforms of the code or to completely substitute it with another one. Until recent times, the Civil Code has only been partially reformed, the most notable reform effort being that associated with Law 17.711. Nevertheless, there have been several projects to replace the Code completely, including one that went so far as to attempt to merge it with the Commercial Code. = Partial reforms = The changes in these laws were made by the court system or by legislative reform, and the ones listed here are only the most influential. *Civil marriage law: The original civil code denied non-Catholics the right to marry. On November 12, 1888, law number 2,393 provided the right of civil marriage, effective immediately. *Women's civil right's law. On September 14, 1924 law number 11,357 provided more legal rights for married women. *Name: The regulation of people's names was addressed as usually by the codifier, as the decrees 11,609/1943 and 410/1946 regulated this institution. *Adoption law: The original civil code did not regulate adoption. On September 23, 1948, law number 13,252 created regulations. *Law of horizontal property: V√©lez S√°rsfield had forbidden the horizontal subdivision of property, which was overruled by law 13,512 made on September 30, 1948. *Sales of real estate by installments or sales of fractioned real estate: The Law No. 14,005 regulated the sale by installments of sets of estates, in order to guide the buyers. It was later modified by the Law No. 23,266. *Land registry and prescription: On October 3 the Law No. 14,159 was sanctioned, establishing rules about the cadastre and the acquisition of real estate by prescription. *Law about children born inside and outside marriage: Law number 14,367, approved on October 11, 1954, partially removed distinctions between children born inside and outside marriage. *Regime about minors and family: Law 14,394 of December 30, 1954 modifies the penal regime of the minors, the minimum age to marry, the simple absence and the decease presumption, and incorporated the family good, which cannot been executed by a debt subsequent to the constitution as such. Another special feature of this law is that in its article 31 implements for the first time in the Argentine legislation the divorce, as part of the fight between Juan Domingo Per√≥n's government and the Catholic Church. After the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora that overthrew Per√≥n, this reform was suspended by the order in council 4070/1956, and later substituted by the law 23,515 in 1987. *Registry of motor vehicles: The order in council 6582/1958 created the National Registry of Motor Vehicles Property and made compulsory the registry of the legal businesses which transmitted their property. *Name of physical persons: The existent regulations about the name were replaced by Law No. 18,248, promulgated on October 28, 1968. *Adoption: The old law was replaced by law number 19,134 on June 3, 1971. *Foundations: Foundations had a void in the code, until Law No. 19,386, which came into effect on September 25, 1972, regulated the regime. *Right of private life: On September 30, 1975, Law No. 21,173 was sanctioned, which included the article 1071 bis on the code regulating said right. *Transplants: The national regime on organ transplants was determined by Law number 21,541, approved on March 18, 1977. *Marks and brands: This regime, used for livestock identification, was incorporated to the legislation by means of Law No. 22,939 of October 6, 1983. Previously it was regulated by the rural codes. *Law of blood: Law No. 22,990 of November 20, 1983 regulates the uses of human blood. *Filiation and paternity authority: Law No. 23,264 of September 25, 1985 compares the children born outside marriage at the same level to those born within, and establishes that parental responsibility can be exercised by both parents. *Civil marriage: Law No. 23,515 modifies the matrimony regime, and reestablishes the divorce, which had been suspended since 1956. *Pact of San Jos√©, Costa Rica: Law No. 23,504 ratified the American Convention on Human Rights which sought to consolidate human rights. *Elimination of all kind of woman discrimination: The ratification of the Convention about the Elimination of all kinds of Discrimination against Women was product of Law No. 23,179. *Convertibility Law: The so-called Convertibility Law fixed the exchange-rate between australs and dollars, and introduced some reforms to the Civil Code's regime. This law, No. 23,928, allowed to convene that the pacted obligations in a foreign currency were to be resolved only in the stipulated currency. This reforms survived the abandoning of the convertibility regime by the Law No. 25,561. *Law of escrow and leasing: Law No. 24,441 incorporated the contract of escrow and leasing, which meant a great advance for the Argentine legislation.  Law No. 17,711  In 1966 the State Secretary Office of Justice designated a commission to evaluate a reform to the Civil Code, without determining whether it should be total or partial. In the beginning the commission was made up of Roberto Mart√≠nez Ruiz, Jos√© Bidau, Guillermo Borda, Abel Fleitas, Jos√© L√≥pez Olaciregui, Dalmiro Alsina Atienza and Alberto Spota; although after the resignation of the last three, only the doctors Bidau, Fleitas and Mart√≠nez Ruiz formed the project. Borda occupied at that moment the position of Interior minister, but that didn't stop him from contributing to the project, as the elevation note established, giving \\"evidence of the valuable and effective collaboration made by the minister of Interior, the doctor Guillermo A. Borda, who dedicated long hours to the deliberations (of the Commission), in spite of the multiple tasks due to the official duties of the position he currently occupies\\"Llamb√≠as (2003), p. 184. Law No. 17,711 was sanctioned on April 22, 1968, and came into force on July 1 that same year. This law affects approximately 5% of the Civil Code articles (200 articles in whole), but its importance trascends numbers, as it changes some of the backbone criteria of the established regime. Among the most important changes, this reform included the theory of abuse of rights, the lesion vice, the good faith principle as the rule for interpretation in contracts, the theory of unforeseenness, the limitation of the absolute character of the property, the generous repairing of moral damage in the contractual and extra-contractual civil responsibility, the possibility of reducing the compensation in the forced crimes, the solidarity of the co-authors of forced crimes, the automatic delay as a rule in obligations with deadlines, the implicit resolutory condition in contracts, the registry inscription as publicity for the transmission of property rights on real estate, the protection of third parties with good faith sub-acquirants of property or personal rights in case of nullity, the acquisition of age at 21, the emancipation by age abilitation, the extension of the capacity of the working minor, the personal separation by joint proposal and modification of the succession order. Although not all the doctrine agreed then with the changes made by the law, which gave it many criticisms, time proved that the reform was an important advance in the Argentine civil legislation. = Integral Reform Projects =  Bibiloni Draft  This was the first project for integral reform of the Civil Code, which took place in 1926. This project was begun by the Law No. 12,542 and then expanded by 13,156, which established a committee formed by a member designated by the Supreme Court of Argentina, another member by the National Academy of Legal Science (Academia Nacional de Ciencias Jur√≠dicas), designated by each of the Civil Courts (C√°maras Civiles) of the Nation's Capital, another member by the Bar Association and another by the department of Right (facultades de Derecho) of the national universities of Buenos Aires, C√≥rdoba, La Plata, and del Litoral. The resulting committee was formed by Roberto Repetto, Juli√°n Pera, Raymundo Salvat, Juan Bibiloni, H√©ctor Lafaille, Enrique Mart√≠nez Paz, Juan Carlos R√©bora, Jos√© Gervasoni and Rodolfo Rivarola. This committee suffered a few changes, as Salvat resigned and was replaced by C√©sar de Tezanos Pinto, while Pera, who ascended to the position of minister of the Supreme Court, was replaced at first by Mariano de Vedia y Mitre and then by Gast√≥n Tobal. Doctor Bibiloni was commissioned the writing of the draft, which would serve as an orientation for debates. Bibiloni finished in six years, but while he was working different books with the same purpose were being published, similar to Dalmacio V√©lez S√°rsfield's bill. Because of this, the committee had started to have debates since 1926 and not 1932. This draft has a great influence in German judicial science, not only directly in the German Civil Code, but also through its commentaries. The code also used the same doctoring tool as V√©lez S√°rsfield, the inclusion of footnotes to establish resolutions.  Draft of 1936  The commission utilized the first draft edited by Bibiloni, but expanded it into a draft law which had great differences with Bibiloni's. Once finished with the first draft, the commission designated Lafaille and Tobal as editors, who sometimes disagreed with what was decided by the commission, and they managed to finish the draft in 1936. In spite of the changes made, the draft was signed by the editors and by Repetto, Rivarola and Mart√≠nez Paz. As far as its methodology, the draft contained a General Section, in which it deals with people, the facts, the things, the practising of the rights and the prescription; and four books in which it deals with the family, the obligations and their sources, the real rights and the succession, and finally it features a law of registries. The whole of the articles of the project is relatively brief; it had 2,144 articles. Each article grouped in several paragraphs the solution to the issues related with the subject that was dealt with in the article, which made them dense but facilitated their study. After the conclusion of editing in 1936, the draft was sent to the National Executive Power on October 10 of that year. The Executive Power sent the draft to Congress, but it was never ratified.  1954 Draft The draft for the Civil Code was written in 1954 by the \\"Institute of Civil Right\\" (Instituto de Derecho Civil), dependent on the Ministry of Justice. Jorge Joaqu√≠n Llamb√≠as was the head of the project, with Roberto Ponssa, Jorge Mazzinghi, Jorge Bargall√≥ Cirio and Ricardo Alberdi as collaborators. The draft contained 1,839 articles, a very small number in comparison with the present Civil Code and other previous projects. Such synthesis was achieved by omitting the repetition of general principles, and defining only the differences to those general principles in the description of the code for particular institutions. The used method contains a Preliminary Title, which consists of three chapters with the general resolution, norm on private international law, and the computation of time periods. Divided in five books, Book I deals with the general principles, the persons, property, facts and juridical acts; Book II with the family, Book III deals with inheritance; Book IV with the obligations and Book V regulates the real and intellectual rights. Because of the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora coup d'√©tat, the project never reached legislative treatment, and remained inedited until 1968, when it was edited by the Universidad Nacional de Tucum√°n.  Project of legislative unification  Article 75 of the Argentine Constitution, at section 12, empowers the Argentine National Congress to dictate the Civil, Commercial, Penal, Mining and Work, and Social Security codes. Because of this, part of the doctrine sustained that the Constitution obstructed the legislative unification. Nevertheless, the authors argued that it is not written in which way it should be done, be it by one single body or more. In 1986, the General Legislative Commission of the Chamber of Deputies created a committee for the \\"unification of the civil and commercial legislation\\", designing H√©ctor Alegr√≠a, Atilio Alterini, Jorge Alterini, Miguel Araya, Francisco de la Vega, Sergio Le Pera and Ana Piaggi as advisors, to whom would later join Horacio Fargosi. On April 22, 1987, the project was raised, and on July 15 sanctioned by the Chamber of Deputies. The project moved on to the Senate, where a temporary commission was formed, which made several reforms, but didn't arrive to a conclusive judgement since its duration was not renovated after the originally intended six months. At the end of 1991 the law was sanctioned with no modifications by the Senate, but later the Executive Power, considering it inadequate to the new political and economical situation, decided to veto it. C√≥digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci√≥n After decades of deliberations, a new code - C√≥digo Civil y Comercial de la Naci√≥n - was approved in 2014 and entered into force in 2015, replacing the old code.

She is known for her work in the women's movement of India, as well as for authoring books like the path-breaking The Other Side of Silence: Voices from and the Partition of India and Speaking Peace: Women's Voices from Kashmir. Along with Ritu Menon, she co-founded Kali for Women, India's first exclusively feminist publishing house, in 1984. In 2003, she founded Zubaan Books, an imprint of Kali for Women. In 2011, Butalia and Menon were jointly awarded the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian order, for their work in Literature and Education. Early life and education Butalia was born in Ambala, Haryana, into a rich, progressive and atheist family of Punjabi heritage. She is the third of the four children of Subhadra and Joginder Singh Butalia. Her mother was a feminist who ran a counselling centre for women. Butalia has one [older] sister, Bela, and two brothers, Pankaj and Rahul. Pankaj Butalia is a left-wing documentary filmmaker best known for a documentary on the miserable conditions of widows living in Vrindavan. Butalia earned a BA in literature from Miranda House, Delhi University, in 1971, a Master's in literature from Delhi University in 1973, and a Master's in South Asian Studies from the University of London in 1977. She speaks various Indian languages (Hindi, Punjabi and Bengali) along with English, Italian and French. Career Urvashi Butalia in October 2016 Butalia started her career working with Oxford University Press in Delhi. She later worked for a year at their Oxford headquarters, before moving briefly to London-based Zed Books as an editor in 1982. She then returned to India and, along with Ritu Menon, set up a feminist publishing house, Kali for Women, in 1984. Butalia's main areas of interest are the Partition and oral histories from a feminist and left-wing perspective. She has written on gender, communalism, fundamentalism and media. Her writings have appeared in several newspapers and magazines publications including The Guardian, the New Internationalist, The Statesman, The Times of India, Outlook and India Today. She has been a regular columnist for the left- wing Tehelka and for Indian Printer and Publisher, a B2B publication dealing with the print and publishing industry. Butalia is a consultant for Oxfam India and she holds the position of Reader at the College of Vocational Studies at the University of Delhi. =Kali for Women = Kali for Women, India's first exclusively feminist publishing house, which Butalia co-founded with and Ritu Menon, was set up in 1984 as a trust to increase the body of knowledge on women in the Third World, to give voice to such knowledge as already exists, and to provide a forum for women writers, creative and academics.Puri, Jyoti, Woman, Body, Desire in Postcolonial India: Narratives of Gender and Sexuality (London: Routledge, 1999). In 2003, co-founders Urvashi Butalia and Ritu Menon parted ways due to unresolvable differences. Both went on to set up their own imprints under the banner of Kali for Women, with Menon establishing Women Unlimited and Butalia founding Zubaan Books. = Zubaan Books = Originally set up as a non-profit in 2003, Zubaan now operates as the private company, Zubaan Publishers Pvt. Ltd., with five stakeholders: Butalia (Founder and CEO), Anita Roy (Editor), Preeti Gill (Editor), Shweta Vachani (Editor) and Satish Sharma (CFO). The independent publishing house publishes fiction and academic books, \\"on, for, by and about women in South Asia\\". They have internationally renown authors such as Jaishree Misra, Nivedita Menon, Manjula Padmanabhan, Suniti Namjoshi and Annie Zaidi. =The Other Side of Silence= Apart from several newspaper articles and op-ed pieces dealing with feminist issues, Butalia has authored or co- authored several books (listed below). Of these, The Other Side of Silence (1998) is believed to be her most popular work. The book, which is the product of more than seventy interviews that Butalia conducted with survivors of the Partition, is being used as an academic text in some Indian universities. The Goethe Institute has described the work as \\"one of the most influential books in South Asian studies to be published in recent decades...It emphasises the role of violence against women in the collective experience of tragedy.\\" Butalia points out that the Partition, like the Holocaust, is still very much a \\"living history\\", in the sense that many survivors are still around and can be interviewed. In contrast to the many projects that have undertaken to document the oral histories of the Holocaust, few comparable initiatives have been undertaken in India. This is one of them. The Other Side of Silence won the Oral History Book Association Award in 2001 and the Nikkei Asia Award for Culture in 2003.  Activism  Butalia is an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP).  Awards and recognition  In 2000, Butalia won the Pandora Award for Women in Publishing. In 2011, Butalia was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. In 2017, the German Federal Republic awarded Butalia the Goethe Medal, an official distinction that \\"honors individuals who have displayed exceptional competence of the German language as well as in international cultural exchange.\\" https://www.goethe.de/resources/files/pdf131/about-urvashi-butalia.pdf  Works    References External links * Zubaan Books website * Biography as a member of the 2006 Lettre Ulysses Award jury * Interview by Anupama Arora and Sandrine Sanos, Journal of Feminist Scholarship 6 (Spring 2014) 1952 births 20th-century Indian businesspeople 20th-century Indian businesswomen 20th- century Indian journalists 20th-century Indian women writers 21st-century Indian businesspeople 21st-century Indian businesswomen 21st-century Indian journalists 21st-century Indian women writers Alumni of the University of London Businesspeople from Haryana Businesswomen from Haryana English-language writers from India Feminist studies scholars Indian feminist writers Indian feminists Indian political writers Indian publishers (people) Indian women journalists Indian women political writers Indian women publishers Journalists from Haryana Journalists from Meghalaya Living people People from Ambala Recipients of the Padma Shri in literature & education University of Delhi alumni Women writers from Haryana Writers from Haryana Winners of the Nikkei Asia Prize ","title":"Urvashi Butalia"},{"id":"2829279","text":"Henry Deane may refer to: * Henry Deane (archbishop of Canterbury) (c. 1440‚Äì1503) * Henry Deane (engineer) (1847‚Äì1924), Australian engineer * Harry Deane (1846‚Äì1925), American baseball player * Sir Bargrave Deane (Henry Bargrave Deane, 1848‚Äì1919), English judge See also *Henry Dean (disambiguation) ","title":"Henry Deane"},{"id":"2829289","text":"Henry Deane (26 March 1847 - 12 March 1924) was an Australian engineer, responsible for electrifying the Sydney tramway system and for building the Wolgan Valley Railway and Trans-Australian Railway.  Biography  Deane was born at Clapham Common, England, the son of Henry Deane, a chemist and fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and his wife Jemima, n√©e Elliott. Deane was schooled in England, matriculating in 1862, then studied at Queen's College, Galway (now the National University of Ireland, Galway), where he graduated B.A. in 1865 honours in mathematics and natural science. Like many others, he was awarded M.A. in 1882 by the Queen's University of Ireland, upon its dissolution.. Deane also studied engineering for two years and obtained his diploma at King's College London as an occasional student. After two years in the office of Sir John Fowler at London, Deane was engaged by Waring Brothers from 1869 to 1871 on the Hungarian railways, and from 1871 to 1873 was chief technical assistant at the shipbuilding works of the Danube Steam Navigation Company, Altofen, Hungary. In 1875, Deane returned to England where he was engaged in roof and bridge designs as well as survey work. In 1879, he moved to the Philippines where he worked on sugar-works. He returned to England but left for Australia at the end of 1879, arriving in Sydney in January 1880 on the Kent. In Sydney, Deane joined the New South Wales Government Railways as a railway surveyor. He was initially involved in the trial survey of the northern line between the Hawkesbury River and Ourimbah. In 1881, Deane was appointed District Engineer on the Gunnedah to Narrabri line. In 1883, he was District Engineer on the Homebush to Hawkesbury line. In July 1886, he became Inspecting Engineer. In June 1889, he became Acting Engineer-in-Chief and then Engineer-in-Chief in 1890. In 1894 and again in 1904, he made world trips studying light railways and tramway systems. From July 1899, his role expanded to include tramway construction and he took a leading part in inaugurating the Sydney electric tramway system. One of his significant advances was the introduction of pioneer standards that lowered construction costs on low- traffic country lines.  Second career  In 1905, the railway construction branch was abolished and Deane retired from the New South Wales railways. In April 1906, he became a consultant to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation and oversaw the survey and construction of the Wolgan Valley Railway. One of his significant innovations was the use of 1 in 25 (4%) grades and 5 chain (100m) curves on a standard gauge railway and with the use of Shay locomotives. On 25 March 1908, he was appointed consulting engineer to the Commonwealth Government in connection with the survey of the transcontinental railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. He had been closely associated with the transcontinental railway since 1903 when he represented New South Wales as chairman of a conference of Engineers-in-Chief on that matter. In 1910 he became engineer-in-chief and supervised the construction of a large portion of this railway. Deane was also consulted on the issue of solving the national break of gauge problem. For example, he was put in charge of the third rail experiments at Tocumwal in 1915, and especially the Brennan switches. He retired from Commonwealth Railways in April 1914 and then practised as a consulting engineer at Melbourne.  Family  Deane died in Melbourne on 12 March 1924, and was buried with Anglican rites in Brighton Cemetery. He was twice married (in 1873 and 1890) and left a widow, three sons and three daughters. He was a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and of several learned societies. He was twice president of the Royal Society of New South Wales and for two years was president of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. In conjunction with Joseph Maiden, Deane published a series of papers on native timbers, and wrote frequently on forestry and botanical subjects. Eucalyptus deanei and Leptospermum deanei were named after him. His work on tertiary fossil botany was particularly valuable, and gave him a high reputation among the geologists of his time. Woodford in Blue Mountains National Park, Australia  Commemoration  The Henry Deane Plaza near Sydney's Central Railway station is named in commemoration of Henry Deane., a fitting tribute since Henry Deane put together plans for the station in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief of Railway Construction, work began on the Central Railway Station in 1901.

The term integrated is used to denote the integration of the arts experience into the learning process. The Integrated Arts Experience provides opportunities for the following processes to occur: # perceptual cognition # metaphorical modes of thinking # use of alternative forms of communication.  Implementation  In many schools integrated arts has been implemented and widely used to teach subjects that retain the attention of students. The rationale for implementing the integration of arts in the education system has been discussed by many of the art educators and others concerned with completeness of general education. Approaches include taking the students to a museum, describing them about the paintings and telling them the background of that painting and then asking the students to write an essay on their visit to museum in English. Another example of teaching the students with the help of arts is making them to first read a chapter of history and then asking them to create a summary of the chapter through painting. Teaching of history can also be done by role play method where the students enact the characters in the class. One other method which can be used for students of first grade or below that for teaching about animals, can be done by making them hear the sounds of different animals and asking them to recognize.  Claimed advantages  Integration of arts in a classroom helps students to connect with the world they live in. The fundamental principle for integrating arts can be thought as follows: * there is a similarity across arts and other subjects. * incorporating arts into other subjects helps in accelerating and facilitating the learning process. * art promotes creativity. * integrated arts program are more economical than separate instruction in each area. The claim for this type of curriculum is that the students who were taught by the integration of arts method had more knowledge and understanding of the inter-relationships among the arts and also developed an appreciation for the arts. It is also claimed integrated art activities is it will help the child to connect his knowledge with the world outside and help him in transferring his learning about arts to many of his other subjects. Related concepts Integrated arts often also refers to hybrid art forms in which new practices are invented and/or combined. Integrated arts practice is related to new media art, computer-based art, and web-based art. While new media is more computer-centric, integrated media (integrated arts) often involves computers plus some other discipline. An example of integrated art that involves new media might be a musical performance done on a computerized interactive multimedia sculpture like WWE. In public media, integrated media and media meshing also refer to the use of multiple orthogonal and perhaps interactive forms, such as news releases, websites, polls, wikis, blogs or forum sources, rather than just a single broadcast mode.

It serves the town of Tarcoola and is the northern junction of the Sydney-Perth and Adelaide-Darwin railways, which share approximately of track between Tarcoola and Crystal Brook. History The Trans-Australian Railway was built through Tarcoola in 1915, and in 1980 it became a junction station when the Adelaide‚ÄìDarwin railway diverged from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. This was extended to Darwin in 2004. It was initially built as a standard gauge replacement for the Central Australia Railway. There is a triangular junction at Tarcoola which joins Crystal Brook, Darwin and Perth. Another triangular junction at Crystal Brook joins Tarcoola, Adelaide and Sydney. The station has two triangles, one for turning locomotives, and the larger one to the west of the town gives direct access from the Darwin line to the Trans-Australian Railway to Kalgoorlie. In 2018, the track between Tarcoola and Adelaide was upgraded from to rails. This was done while the track was open for service, with of rail being replaced at a time between train services. The upgrade increased the maximum permitted axle load by four tonnes.

The dispute arose over a failed appearance at a radio promotional show. There were two Roxannes in question, Roxanne Shant√© and The Real Roxanne. History In 1984, the hip-hop trio U.T.F.O., produced by the R&B; group Full Force, released a single titled \\"Hanging Out,\\" which did not do well. However, it was the single's B side, Roxanne, Roxanne, a song about a woman who would not respond to their advances, that gained much attention and airplay. Soon afterwards, 14-year-old Lolita Shant√© Gooden walked outside a New York City housing project called Queensbridge, when she heard Tyrone Williams, disc jockey Mr. Magic, and record producer Marley Marl talking about how U.T.F.O. had canceled an appearance on a show they were promoting. Gooden offered to make a hip-hop record that would get back at U.T.F.O., with her taking on the moniker Roxanne Shant√©, after her middle name. The three took her up on the idea, with Marley producing Roxanne's Revenge. The single was released in late 1984, taking the original beats from an instrumental version of Roxanne, Roxanne. It was very confrontational and laced with profanities, but was an instant hit that sold over 250,000 copies in the New York area alone. The original issue of the Street Version was recorded on tape in Marley Marl's bedroom, entirely free-styled by Gooden in seven minutes and in only one take. The recording was pressed onto 100 copies which were rushed out onto the streets to combat U.T.F.O.'s Roxanne, Roxanne release. Select Records claimed copyrights on the instrumental which led Pop Art Records to negotiate an agreement where all future copies of Roxanne's Revenge would feature a different track. It was subsequently re-released in early 1985 with new beats and the obscenities removed. Following this, U.T.F.O. and Full Force decided to release their own answer record. While not directly aimed at Roxanne Shant√©, this record featured Elease Jack, who took on the moniker of The Real Roxanne (and was soon replaced by Adelaida Martinez). This also was a hit, but it may have also produced an undesired result: while there had been answer records before (such as the semi-disco song Somebody Else's Guy and Games People Play/Games Females Play), they usually ended with the second recording. But in this saga, with a third record in airplay, a whole new trend began. Roxanne Shant√© responded back by releasing Bite This and Queen Of Rox (Shant√© Rox On). The airwaves became occupied with the Roxanne records that other MCs decided to get into the act. Over the next year, anywhere from 30 to over 100 answer records (according to different claims) were produced, portraying Roxanne's family, or making various claims about her. The ones that were more well known were the following: * Sparky's Turn (Roxanne, You're Through) * Roxanne's Doctor ‚Äì The Real Man by Dr. Freshh, * Do the Roxanne by Dr. Rocx & Co. * The Parents of Roxanne by Gigolo Tony & Lacey Lace, which answered both UTFO and Sparky D. It drew references from both Roxanne's Revenge and The Real Roxanne as if both represented the true Roxanne. * I‚Äôm Lil Roxanne by Tanganyika, was a record by the then young artist named Tanganyika stating that she was the younger version of the original Roxanne. * Yo, My Little Sister (Roxanne's Brothers) by Crush Groove (no relation to Krush Groove), which answered UTFO, Sparky D, and Dr. Freshh. * Rappin' Roxy: Roxanne's Sister by D.W. and the Party Crew featuring Roxy, which reuses several lines from The Real Roxanne and attacks both UTFO and Sparky D. * Ice Roxanne by Little Ice Another record answering Roxanne Shant√© by a young female, who citing a line in Roxanne's Revenge tells Roxanne to \\"make up her mind\\" if she wanted a man or not. * Roxanne's a Man (The Untold Story‚ÄîFinal Chapter) by Ralph Rolle, which claimed that Roxanne was actually a man who had been raped in prison, and then having \\"lost his manhood\\", turned himself into a woman after his release; and insulted UTFO for not realizing this. * The Final Word ‚Äì No More Roxanne (Please) by The East Coast Crew, the final record that told the world to end it all.

Previously, he was Minister of Finance in the VMRO-DPMNE government led by Ljubƒço Georgievski until 2002. Under the Pr≈æino Agreement mediated by the European Union, Gruevski agreed to resign and left his post on 18 January 2016.http://www.balkanews.org/index.php/2016/01/27/macedonia-premier-to-step- down-under-western-brokered-deal/ In May 2018 he was sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges. In November 2018 he was ordered to serve his sentence but failed to check-in with authorities and instead fled to Hungary, where he sought and was granted political asylum. Gruevski has been accused of promoting the controversial identity politics called antiquization. Under his leadership the country which had pro-European and pro-NATO policy, has changed sides to pro-Russian, pro-Serbian and anti-Western one.Jasmin Mujanovic, Hunger and Fury: The Crisis of Democracy in the Balkans, Oxford University Press, 2018, , pp. 115; 162.Sarantis Michalopoulos, Tensions grow before biggest secret is revealed: FYROM's new name, EURACTIV Jan 18, 2018.Vassilis Petsinis, From pro-American to pro-Russian?

Gruevski has opposed to the Friendship treaty signed with Bulgaria in 2017 and the Prespa agreement signed with Greece in 2018, despite both neighboring states being NATO and EU members. Personal life Born in Skopje in 1970, Gruevski was brought up in a family that was neither privileged nor poor. His father worked in furniture and design and his mother was a nurse. After his parents' divorce, he was raised by his mother. At the age of four, however, she went to work in Libya, like thousands of other Yugoslav citizens, and took him with her.A profile of Gruevski, The Economist, 12 August 2011 After their return Gruevski completed primary and secondary education in Skopje. Having graduated from the Faculty of Economics at the St. Clement of Ohrid University in Bitola in 1994 (where he dabbled in amateur theatre and boxing) he entered the nascent finance sector, and was the first person to trade on Skopje's stock exchange. During 1995 he worked as director of department in Multigroup owned Balkanbank, and became its exhibitioner till 1998. In 1996 he also acquired qualifications for the international capital market from a London Securities Institute. Gruevski founded the Brokerage Association of Macedonia in 1998 and made the first transaction on the Macedonian Stock Exchange. On 12 December 2006, he obtained a master's degree from the Faculty of Economics at the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. Gruevski divorced his first wife and was married again in May 2007 to Borkica Gruevska with whom he has two daughters: Anastasija and Sofija. Gruevski's paternal grandparents came from the Ottoman Macedonia village of Krushoradi, where his grandfather Nikolaos Grouios (Nikola Gruev) (1911‚Äì1940) was born. Until the official Greek annexation after the Second Balkan War in 1913, it was under the jurisdiction of the Bulgarian Exarchate. The Greek administration later practised an assimilative anti-Bulgarian campaign, changing the names of local villagers to the corresponding Greek names.Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Author Victor Roudometof, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , pp. 62-63.Ivo Banac, \\"The Macedoine\\" in \\"The National Question in Yugoslavia. Origins, History, Politics\\", pp. 307-328, Cornell University Press, 1984, retrieved on 8 September 2007. Macedonia was partitioned by the Treaty of Bucharest (1913), whereby over half of the land went to Greece (Aegean Macedonia) and most of the remainder to Serbia (Vardar Macedonia), leaving slightly more than one-tenth to Bulgaria (Pirin Macedonia)...The immediate effect of the partition was an anti-Bulgar campaign in areas under Serbian and Greek rule. The Serbians expelled Exarchist churchmen and teachers and closed Bulgar schools and churches (affecting the standing of as many as 641 schools and 761 churches). Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria, joining a still larger stream from devastated Aegean Macedonia, where the Greeks burned Kukush, the center of Bulgar politics and culture, as well as much of Serres and Drama. Bulgarian (including the Macedonian dialects) was prohibited, and its surreptitious use, whenever detected, was ridiculed or punished. For a detailed report on the atrocities of Greek Boulgarophagoi (Bulgarianeaters) in Aegean Macedonia, see Report of the International Commission on the Balkan Wars.. The village itself was renamed by the Greek authorities to Achlada in 1926. Gruevski's grandfather fought in the Greco-Italian War, where he lost his life. His name is mentioned on the war memorial in Achlada among the names of the locals who were killed during World War II. Years later, during the Greek Civil War, Gruevski's grandmother and father fled north to what was then Yugoslav Macedonia, where they changed their family name to Gruevski in order to gain citizenship through assimilation, as was the Yugoslav policy at the time. Gruevski's maternal grandfather - Mihail D. Miyalkov was a member of the Bulgarian Action Committees in 1941 and later of a Bulgarian club founded in ≈útip in 1942, when the area was annexed by Bulgaria during the Second World War.–ö—Ä–∞—Å–µ–Ω –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤, –ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫–∞—á–∞–Ω–æ–≤ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞ —Ñ–µ–π—Å–±—É–∫ –ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è –∑–∞ –í–ú–†–û, –∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–∏—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –¥–æ –ì—Ä—É–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏.

His mother Nadezhda is also from ≈útip. She is a sister of the first Minister of the Interior of the Republic of Macedonia - Jordan Mijalkov. During the administration of Nikola Gruevski, his first cousin, Sa≈°o Mijalkov was the director of the Administration for Security and Counterintelligence of the Republic of Macedonia. Political career =Minister of Finance (1999‚Äì2002)= The government under Ljubƒço Georgievski sold the Macedonian Telecom to Hungarian Mat√°v and the OKTA oil refinery to Hellenic Petroleum. Gruevski also implemented financial reforms, including the reform of the payment system and the value added tax of 18%, requiring fiscal receipts for all Macedonian businesses, which was a program designed to fight tax evasion. =Party leader (2003‚Äì2017)= Gruevski is the leader of the nationalist ruling party VMRO-DPMNE. After VMRO-DPMNE was defeated in the 2002 parliamentary election, there was a period of infighting within the party. Gruevski emerged as the pro-EU leader, and he was elected as leader of the party after Ljubƒço Georgievski left the position. The former prime minister set up his own party (VMRO-People's Party), but VMRO-DPMNE retained most of the party's supporters. =Prime Minister (2006‚Äì2016)= Gruevski and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Washington, D.C., 16 February 2011 The VMRO-DPMNE won the July 2006 parliamentary election, and on 25 August 2006 he constituted the new government. His government had many new faces, mostly in their 30s, in key ministries and other positions. In the election Gruevski earned the distinction of becoming the first elected European head of government born in the 1970s.Who's your daddy? (accessed 24 December 2010)Deputy Prime Minister > Biography (accessed 24 December 2010) In June 2007, Gruevski attended a meeting in Tirana, Albania, along with President of the United States George W.

The polling was marred by a number of violent incidents and allegations of fraud in some ethnic Albanian dominated municipalities. Gruevski created a government with the ethnic Albanian political party Democratic Union for Integration.\\"PM claims win in Macedonian poll\\", BBC News, Link accessed 01/06/08 European People's Party Summit in Brussels in March 2014 The coalition led by his party, VMRO-DPMNE, won the 5 June 2011 parliamentary election, their third electoral victory in a row, winning 56 out of the 123 seats in the parliament. Objections of misuse of state resources, including the blackmail of over one hundred thousand public servants to act as agitators were neglected, and the elections were declared valid. Gruevski formed the new government, again in coalition with the Democratic Union for Integration. On 6 January 2012, Gruevski opened the triumphal arch \\"Porta Macedonia\\" in Skopje as a monument to 20th anniversary of Macedonian independence, and admitted that he personally has been the instigator of the Skopje 2014 project. On 27 April 2014, VMRO-DPMNE won the parliamentary election, providing Gruevski another term as Prime Minister. In 2014, Gruevski began to rush plans through Parliament to create a tax-free autonomous trade zone that falls outside the purview of both domestic and international regulators. The move raised alarm among Parliament members. The European Union's Venice Commission commented that \\"If all laws (other than criminal laws) are to be enacted and enforced by a managing body rather than the constitutionally recognised lawmaker and executive, this zone becomes a sort of a 'State within a State' separate from the existing constitutional structure\\" and could become \\"a haven for 'dirty money.'\\" In 2015 the former Prime Minister and founder of the VMRO-DPMNE, Ljubƒço Georgievski accused Gruevski's government it had a goal to serbianise the country, finally joining it to Serbia.–†–∞–¥–∏–æ –°–ª–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞, —ò–∞–Ω—É–∞—Ä–∏ 23, 2015, –ú–∞—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –ú–∏—Ç–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞, –°—Ä–±–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞? Wiretapping scandal and resignation In May 2015, protests occurred in Skopje against Gruevski and his government. The demonstrations began following charges being brought against Zoran Zaev, the opposition leader, who responded by alleging that Gruevski had had 20,000 Macedonian officials and other figures wiretapped, and had covered up the murder of a young man by a police officer in 2011. A major protest occurred on 5 May, with violent clashes between activists and police, causing injuries on both sides. In the days following, the opposition claimed that more anti- government actions would occur, which they did later that month. Several ministers, including the interior minister, resigned. Gruevski initially refused to step down, saying on 16 May that \\"if I back down it would be a cowardly move ... I‚Äôll face down the attacks.\\" However, on 15 January 2016, Emil Dimitriev was nominated as Prime Minister and he assumed office on 18 January, following the arranged pre-electoral resignation of Gruevski from the position, as part of the Przino Agreement. Post-premiership (since 2017) In July 2017, a Macedonian court ordered the seizure of the passports of Gruevski and four other officials of his party, including former interior minister Gordana Jankuloska and former transportation minister Mile Janakieski, in connection with the wiretapping case.

On 9 November 2018, the Skopje Criminal Court rejected Gruevski's appeals for a postponement of his prison sentence and on 10 November he did not appear for the start of his two-year sentence. He had been last seen in Macedonia on 8 November at a hotel in Skopje. The Macedonian authorities issued an arrest warrant against the fugitive. VMRO-DPMNE's leader, Hristijan Mickoski defended Gruevski and described the arrest warrant and police search against him as \\"political persecution\\" and a \\"witch-hunt\\", adding that VMRO-DPMNE was \\"under police siege\\". =Fugitive= Gruevski and Viktor Orb√°n in June 2015 On 13 November, Gruevski announced through his Facebook account that he had fled to Hungary, where he applied for political asylum.

However, according to Bulgarian authorities, Gruevski has never applied for Bulgarian citizenship.Bulgarian Ministry of Justice: Nikola Gruevski has not become a Bulgarian citizen. FOCUS News Agency, 15 November 2018. It was later confirmed by Albanian police that, with the aid of the Hungarian government which escorted him using Hungarian diplomatic vehicles, Gruevski had passed through Albania, Montenegro and Serbia before arriving in Hungary. Interpol alerted that Gruevski is wanted under an international arrest warrant and the Macedonian government filed a formal extradition request. Hungary's opposition parties are calling on the Hungarian government to arrest and quickly extradite the fugitive former prime minister back to Macedonia. On 20 November 2018, Gruevski was granted political asylum by the Hungarian authorities. Gruevski has condemned the Prespa agreement and stated that Prime Minister Zoran Zaev \\"scammed\\" and \\"tricked\\" the Macedonian people over the name change of the country and that Greek politicians imposed an unfavourable deal upon Macedonia that outlines exclusive claims over \\"antique history\\" by Greece. On 27 June 2019, Gruevski appeared handcuffed in a court in Budapest on a hearing closed for the public for his extradition requested by the North Macedonian authorities. Later that day the court in Budapest announced that his extradition was rejected. According to judge √âva V√°rhegyi the conditions needed for his extradition were not fulfilled. On 21 July 2020, Gruevski's position as an honorary president of VMRO-DPNME was taken away, along with other changes that were made to democratize the party.

In 2015, it merged with MeadWestvaco to form the WestRock company. It was one of North America's leading producers of corrugated and consumer packaging and recycling solutions, with annualized net sales of approximately $10 billion. The company employed approximately 26,000 people and operated more than 245 facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and China. Company history RockTenn Company was formed in 1973, the product of a merger between Tennessee Paper Mills Inc. and Rock City Packaging, Inc. Its origins date back to 1898, when the Rock City Box Company of Nashville, Tennessee, was founded. Among its customers in the mid-1940s were a local boot factory, a local candy manufacturer, a hosiery company, and several shirt manufacturers. The owners, Joe McHenry and A.E. Saxon, who also operated several other business ventures, wanted to sell out and retire. Rock City was attractive to Arthur Newth Morris, owner of the Southern Box Company, not least for its bank account of $60,000. Morris purchased the company in 1944 for $200,000, making a cash down payment of $50,000. The 25-year-old Morris had been a printer and part-time Presbyterian minister when he went to work in 1926 for Edwin J. Schoettle, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, industrialist who owned a group of box and printing companies that bore his name. For a monthly salary of $350 Morris was expected to manage several hundred employees, some of them more than twice his age. He also traveled along the eastern seaboard, explaining to meat packers his discovery that they could avoid shrinkage of their hot dogs by putting them in Schoettle's boxes instead of stringing them up like bananas. By 1935, Morris was making a salary on which he could comfortably support his wife and four children, but he wanted to go into business for himself. Armed with life savings of $5,000 and a $7,500 investment by his boss, he moved to Baltimore, Maryland. There he managed the J.E. Smith Box & Printing Co. during the day, while running the Southern Box Company, a company he founded in 1936, at night. Using Smith's presses, die-cutters, and other box making equipment during the evening, Morris began servicing two anchor customers who knew him from his Philadelphia days. Only six months after Morris had left Philadelphia, Schoettle came to Baltimore to offer him a promotion and a $25,000 salary. When Morris refused, Schoettle offered to sell Morris his own majority share of Southern Box for $25,000. A bank loan to Morris made the deal possible. He moved to new quarters for $200 a month, left day-to-day management to one of his employees, and devoted himself to finding new accounts. In its first year the company made a few thousand dollars on sales of $60,000. By 1942, Morris was doing well enough to open a corrugated box plant and to buy another Baltimore enterprise, the King Folding Box Co., where he installed a corrugated sheet cutter. Morris sold corrugated partitions to major glass companies, which needed them to separate the bottles and glasses they shipped. The following year the name of his enterprise was changed to Newth Morris Box Company. In 1944, another branch was opened in Jacksonville, Florida, where the company produced cardboard anti-radar devices for World War II American troops and popcorn boxes for movie theater owners. Following Morris's purchase of Rock City Box Co. that same year, he changed the name of Newth Morris Box Co. to Rock City Box Sales Company. Morris's purchase of Rock City Box Co. put him in contact with one of its suppliers and his future merger partner: Tennessee Paper Mills. Andrew M. Tomlinson and John Stagmaier, two of Tennessee Paper's three founders, were Athens, Tennessee, businessmen who already owned box factories. The company's third founder was A.M. Sheperd of Vincennes, Indiana, a boxboard manufacturer. Tennessee Paper Mills was incorporated in 1917 with Stagmaier as president, Tomlinson as vice-president, and Sheperd as general manager. With $300,000 raised from stock offerings, the three men established a paperboard factory in Chattanooga, where operation began in July 1918. By the end of the year the new company had made a net profit of $23,367 on sales of $165,799. Although the founders originally planned to make board from wheat straw, they turned instead to wastepaper as the primary raw material; thus Tennessee Paper became the first recycled paperboard mill in the South. To reduce its electric bill, the company installed its own steam generating plant in 1926. Paperboard production averaged 20 tons a day in the early years, reaching an average of 56.77 tons in 1930, the same year that the company produced a record 15,557 tons of product. This figure would not be matched for some time because of the Great Depression; production dropped to 11,995 tons in 1934. The company remained profitable, however, although only modestly so. As the nation's economy slowly recovered, Tennessee Paper's volume of business increased to meet renewed demand. During 1939 the factory operated at 85 percent capacity, compared with the industry average of 71 percent. In 1941, it operated a record 305 days. Sales volume exceeded $1.7 million in 1945. A second papermaking machine doubled the mill's capacity in 1949. Beginning in 1954, however, Tennessee Paper began losing customers to companies manufacturing lower-cost folding cartons and corrugated and plastic containers. The trend in the business was toward vertical integration. Many paperboard companies acquired or merged with their customers. Typically profits were made at the mill level, by selling boxes virtually at cost. The effect on boxmakers was so severe that by 1957 Tennessee Paper was extending credit and loans to its customers in order to keep their accounts. One of these customers was Rock City. Its consumption of Tennessee Paper's board grew from about 1,000 tons in 1944 to about 37,000 tons in 1972, when it took 44 percent of Tennessee Paper's total boxboard production. Between 1965 and 1968 Tennessee Paper bought 29.5 percent of Rock City's common stock, preparing the way for the eventual merger of the two companies. By then Rock City owed Tennessee Paper more than $4 million in loans. Morris's burgeoning industrial empire grew both by acquisitions and by establishing new companies. Among the former was the Parks Box & Printing Co., located on a leased 11-acre tract in Norcross, Georgia. This land was purchased in 1957 and gradually became the focal point for management of all the Morris companies. A new 30,000-square- foot warehouse was added to the Norcross facility in 1960. Each of the Morris companies operated as a separate and virtually autonomous profit center. Rock City opened not only small set-up and folding carton plants but also facilities in Livingston and Milan, Tennessee, to meet the packaging needs of shirtmakers. A set-up box division was established in 1955. Rock City Waste Paper Co. collected, sorted, and baled wastepaper for sale to paper mills. Other Morris companies and plants sprouted throughout the South. Sales grew from $8 million in 1959 to $12.9 million in 1967, when all the companies were consolidated into Rock City Packaging, Inc. Morris became chairman of the board and a son-in-law, Worley Brown, became president. Sales volume reached $23 million in 1972. Meanwhile, in order to meet the competition, Tennessee Paper began buying customers to assure continued markets for its paperboard products. In 1964, it acquired Knoxville Paper Box Co., Inc., a manufacturer of folding and set-up boxes, for about $1 million. In 1969, Tennessee Paper acquired wastepaper factories in Knoxville and Atlanta, and in 1972 it built another wastepaper plant in Chattanooga. =Formation of RockTenn in 1973= The merger of Rock City Packaging and Tennessee Paper Mills in 1973 gave Morris, Brown, and others who held stock in the former companies a controlling interest in the new corporation, RockTenn Company. Most Tennessee Paper common stockholders received preferred stock in the new company that earned them triple the dividends they had been receiving. Some shareholders, however, opted for cash instead. The president of Tennessee Paper, W. Max Finley, and his immediate family, received common stock in the new company. Finley was elected chairman of the board and Brown became president and chief executive officer. Reorganization did nothing to slow down expansion. The Crescent Box & Printing Co. of Tullahoma, Tennessee, was acquired in 1973 and Clevepak Corporation's Conway, Arkansas, folding carton plant in 1974. By 1976 the company had 29 divisions. Sales in 1974, the first fiscal year after the merger, reached $47.7 million. In 1978 Bradley Currey, Jr., a veteran officer of the Trust Company of Georgia who had helped effect the merger, became president and chief operating officer of RockTenn. Brown became chairman of the board while remaining chief executive officer. Finley moved to senior chairman of the board. Morris remained chairman of the executive committee until his death in January 1985. Currey later became RockTenn's chairman (in 1993) and CEO (in 1989) as well as its president. =Acquisition-fueled growth in the 1980s and 1990s= In 1982 RockTenn's sales volume reached $133 million and its production of recycled paperboard peaked at 180,000 tons, most of which it used itself in the manufacture of folding cartons and containers and corrugated boxes. Its many customers included Coca-Cola, DuPont and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which it serviced from facilities in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas with a workforce of 1,700 people. In a 1983 Atlanta Constitution interview, Currey attributed the decade-old company's growth to \\"luck, chance, and circumstance ... but the success of any company depends on its people.\\" He added that the company had gone to great lengths \\"to make sure the workers know that we care\\" a group of senior executives took a month each year to travel to each of the company's facilities in order to talk to employees and present service awards. RockTenn made its biggest acquisition yet in 1983, when it paid $40 million to buy 11 Clevepak Corporation plants, seven of which were making partitions to protect glass and plastic containers. Currey said the acquisition would allow RockTenn to capture about one-fourth of the partition market, raise annual revenue to more than $200 million, and increase production of recycled paperboard to 235,000 tons. In 1989, net sales had reached $515.9 million, and net income was $31.1 million. The following year the company dedicated to Chairman of the Board Finley a 33,000-square-foot office building behind its headquarters in Norcross. In 1990, RockTenn acquired Allforms Packaging Corp. of Long Island, New York, and Box Innards Inc. of Orange, California. The next year it purchased the former Specialty Paperboard Inc. mill in Sheldon Springs, Vermont, and Ellis Paperboard Products Inc. of Scarborough, Maine, a manufacturer of folding cartons and solid-fiber partitions. The Ellis purchase included its Canadian subsidiary, Dominion Paperboard Products Ltd. With these additions RockTenn controlled 60 manufacturing and distribution operations, including eight mills with a total annual production capacity of 607,000 tons of recycled paperboard products. RockTenn now ranked sixth among U.S. producers of recycled paperboard, with market share of 5.7 percent. Net sales rose from $564.1 million in 1991, ending September 30, 1991, to $655.5 million in 1992, but dipped to $650.7 million in 1993. Net income rose from $25 million in 1991 to $33.2 million in 1992 before dipping to $25.5 million in 1993. The 1993 figure included unusual after-tax expenses of $5.8 million. Production in 1994 was 700,000 tons of recycled paperboard, of which 182,000 tons was clay-coated recycled paperboard. The first public offering of RockTenn stock, amounting to about 14 percent of the shares outstanding, was made in March 1994. A handful of shareholders offered about 3.6 million shares of Class A common stock, while the company itself offered about 900,000 shares. An analysis in Barron's described RockTenn's balance sheet as \\"attractive\\" and said the company was \\"more soundly financed than many in its field,\\" noting that long-term debt of $51.6 million was only one year's cash flow. Although calling the offering somewhat pricey at $16.50 a share, it noted that \\"RockTenn's emphasis on recycling makes it well-suited to customers wishing to appear environmentally responsible, and could also prove profitable if use of woodlands is restricted.\\" Officers and directors of RockTenn still controlled about 71 percent of the combined voting power of Class A and B common stock after the offering. In December 1993, RockTenn paid $35 million for Les Industries Ling, a Canadian company that used recycled paperboard to make folding cartons. The newly acquired plant, which was to serve as the principal supplier of recycled clay-coated paperboard for RockTenn's Vermont mill, became the company's second largest folding carton facility. A year later, RockTenn agreed to acquire Olympic Packaging, an Illinois-based manufacturer of folding cartons, and Alliance Display and Packaging Co. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, maker of corrugated displays. The purchases, which boosted RockTenn's acquisitions of manufacturing operations to 17 in a decade, cost about $75 million. By the middle of the 1990s, RockTenn had 59 facilities in 19 states and Canada. Net sales reached $705.8 million during 1994, constituting an 11.8 percent compounded annual growth rate for the past decade. Net income came to a record $37.5 million. Late in 1995 COO Jay Shuster was named president of RockTenn, with Currey retaining the posts of chairman and CEO. In January 1997, RockTenn consummated the largest acquisition in its history, purchasing Waldorf Corporation for $239 million in cash and the assumption of $170 million in debt. Based in St. Paul, Minnesota, Waldorf operated six folding carton plants and three paperboard mills in Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina and Wisconsin; the firm had revenues of $377 million during 1996. The acquisition propelled RockTenn into the number two position among producers of folding cartons in North America and also made the company the leading manufacturer of recycled paperboard in the United States. RockTenn followed up with two smaller deals in mid-1997, adding Wright City, Missouri- based Rite Paper Products, Inc., a producer of laminated recycled paperboard products primarily for the furniture industry, and the Davey Company, a manufacturer of high-density recycled paperboard mainly used in book covers and binders that operated mills in Aurora, Illinois; and Jersey City, New Jersey. Also in 1997, RockTenn and Sonoco Products Company created a fiber partition joint venture called RTS Packaging, LLC, with RockTenn holding a 65 percent stake and Sonoco the remaining 35 percent. The venture combined RockTenn's eight partition plants with the seven that had been owned by Sonoco. Although the purchase of Waldorf pushed RockTenn's revenues past the $1 billion mark for the first time in 1997, difficulties in the integration process resulted in a depressed profit figure of $16.1 million. Some of the profit shortfall was attributable to costs stemming from plant closings, and the company closed additional plants in the next two fiscal years as profit levels recovered somewhat. =Increasing focus on packaging and merchandising displays: early 2000s= In October 1999, RockTenn went outside its ranks for a new CEO, hiring James A. Rubright, who had previously been the head of the pipeline group and energy services business of Sonat, Inc. Currey handed over the chairmanship to Rubright as well in January 2000. Later in 2000, Shuster, having been passed over for the CEO position, left the company. Rubright accelerated the pace of restructuring at RockTenn through the closure of a number of under-performing plants. He also shifted the company's emphasis away from the slow-growing recycled paperboard side and toward the areas with higher growth potential: the folding carton and plastics packaging businesses, as well as the burgeoning merchandising display operation, which by the early 2000s was the U.S. leader in point-of-purchase displays. During 2000, RockTenn closed one laminated-paperboard products plant and three folding carton plants, resulting in 550 employee terminations and charges of $61.1 million and a net loss for the year of $15.9 million. Seven more plants were closed over the next three years, resulting in the loss of 450 more jobs and an additional $19 million in charges. Meantime, in February 2000 the company formed a joint venture with Lafarge Corporation called Seven Hills Paperboard, LLC, which was charged with producing gypsum paperboard liner for the U.S. drywall manufacturing plants of Lafarge. RockTenn owned 49 percent of the venture. RockTenn also beefed up its merchandising display business, its fastest-growing segment, through two acquisitions costing a total of $25.4 million. In November 2001, Advertising Display Company, a producer of both temporary and permanent point-of-purchase displays, was acquired. In March of the following year RockTenn bought Athena Industries, Inc., a Burr Ridge, Illinois, manufacturer of permanent point-of-purchase displays, with an emphasis on wire displays. On December 20, 2001, RockTenn Company announced revised historical segment operating income results, because it had changed its presentation of certain segment operating income data for fiscal 2002. Acquisition activity continued in 2003 with the purchase of Cartem Wilco Group Inc., a privately held Canadian maker of folding cartons and specialty packaging, for $65.3 million. The deal accelerated RockTenn's expansion into the growing pharmaceutical and health and beauty packaging market. Cartem Wilco, which operated plants in Montreal and Quebec City, also produced folding cartons for food packaging and consumer products. In August 2003 RockTenn paid about $16 million for Pacific Coast Packaging Corp., located in Kerman, California. RockTenn secured its first folding carton operation on the West Coast through this acquisition, gaining a manufacturer of folding cartons for the fast-food, in-store deli, and gift box markets. =Smurfit-Stone acquisition= Fernandina Beach In 2010‚Äì2011, RockTenn made a successful bid for Smurfit-Stone Container, the world's-largest producer and recycler of paperboard.Brown, Lisa (February 26, 2011). \\"Smurfit had another suitor before RockTenn deal\\".

The disparity between alpha and beta radiation (alpha activity is typically 100‚Äì1000 times weaker than beta, so the particle loses much more negatively charged particles than positively charged ones) leads to buildup of positive electrostatic charge on the particle, causing the particle to \\"jump\\" from surface to surface and easily become airborne. Fuel fleas are typically rich in uranium 238 and contain an abundance of insoluble fission products. Due to their high beta activity, they can be detected by a Geiger counter. Their gamma output can allow analysis of their isotope composition (and therefore their age and origin) by a gamma-ray spectrometer. Fuel fleas can be very dangerous if they become embedded within a person's body, but are generally not considered more dangerous than an equal amount of radioactive material evenly distributed throughout the body.Health effects of alpha-emitting particles in the respiratory tract. EPA Office of Radiation Programs 1976. An exception would be if the flea was embedded in a particularly vulnerable organ such as the cornea of the eye or inhaled into the lungs.Hot particle discussion regarding Fukushima fallout at UC Berkeley ‚Äì http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/node/4459 Some paper suggests a 1 in 10 to 1 in 2 chance for a lesion per hot particle inhaled ‚Äì http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/28/061/28061202.pdf The most likely cause of fuel fleas is when the cladding surrounding the nuclear fuel becomes ruptured or cracked (known as \\"fuel pin failure\\"), allowing the fuel particles to escape and allowing the coolant to enter the fuel rod, further accelerating the process. In water-cooled reactors, this can be due to the reaction of the zirconium alloy cladding with the cooling water, which produces hydrogen. The hydrogen can be absorbed into the cladding material, resulting in hydrogen embrittlement. Embrittled cladding is less ductile and more susceptible to cracking. This process is avoided in modern reactors by carefully monitoring the fuel assemblies, limiting operating lifetime of the fuel, and by using alloys developed to resist hydride formation.

(London, 1831), vol. 2 p. 92  Life  Wolde Selassie, who descended from the nobility of Antalo in Enderta,Mansfield Parkyns, Life in Abyssinia, vol. 2 p. 93. emerged as the ruler of Tigray, Hamasien and Mareb Melash (Eritrea) after years of fighting; Nathaniel Pearce describes an encounter where he made a name for himself by single-handedly slaying the brothers Abel and Cail, \\"two of Ras Michael's choice men\\" who were sent by Michael to kill Wolde Selasse. Despite the fact Ras Mikael Sehul was so impressed at this act of bravery that he tried to make peace with him, but Wolde Selassie remembered how the older man had killed his father, and until the old Ras died he spent his years in exile amongst the Wollo and in Gojjam.Pearce, The Life and Adventures, vol. 2 pp. 87f Wolde Gabriel, grandson of Ras Mikael, attempted to crush Wolde Selassie when the later was in Wogera, but according to Pearce after besieging Wolde Selassie for 20 days Wolde Gabriel came off the worse, and made peace by proclaiming him Balgadda, or governor of the salt-making districts.Pearce, The Adventures, vol. 2 p. 88 After Wolde Gabriel's death in battle against Ras Aligaz of Yejju the then Emperial regent of Abyssinia, Wolde Selassie petitioned Emperor Tekle Giyorgis for the governorship of his kingdom, Enderta, but the Emperor \\"according to his usual bad faith\\" made another warlord, Ras Gebre Masqal, governor of Enderta instead. Wolde Selassie then quickly marched forth with a smaller army against the Ras, which he defeated, then entered Gebre Masqal's camp and took the Ras prisoner. Shortly afterwards he marched on Gondar. The two Emperors, Tekle Haymanot and Tekle Giyorgis bestowed Wolde-Sillasie the titles of both Ras and Bitwoded of the Abyssinian empire in 1790.Henry Salt, A voyage to Abyssinia, p. 252 Wolde Selassie made his seat of government in Chalacot, but maintained his capital at Antalo in Enderta Province. He built four palaces, at Chelekot, Antalo, Felegdaro and Mekelle, all in Enderta. He played a role in the politics of the Imperial Throne, in part by providing shelter to Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I in 1799 and 1800, and was visited by the former Emperor Baeda Maryam in 1813.Pankhurst, History, pp. 201f. Although at first he cooperated with Ras Aligaz, the Imperial Regent, after his power grew, Wolde Selassie came to challenge Aligaz for that office prior to Aligaz's death in 1803.Mordechai Abir, Ethiopia: The Era of the Princes; The Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian Empire (1769-1855) (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 31 The first years of the 19th century were disturbed by fierce campaigns between Ras Gugsa of Begemder, and Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray, who fought over control of the figurehead Emperor Egwale Seyon. Wolde Selassie was eventually the victor, and practically ruled the whole country as Enderase till his death in 1816. Wolde Selassie, a conservative Christian who greatly valued Ethiopia's monarchical traditions, hated the Yeju parvenus. He hit out at them by effectively conquering the Azebo and Raya and by taking control over all the important passes in Lasta leading to Tigray. He then turned his attention to the coast, slowly but surely imposing his suzerainty over the Muslim authorities there until he finally could control and tax their trade inland; he used the revenues, to train, reform and re-equip his army and when the 19th century opened, Wolde Selassie was by far Abyssinia's leading figure and certainly the main champion of the Solomonic tradition.Harold G. Marcus, A history of Ethiopia (University of California press: 2002), p. 53 Ras Wolde Selassie was known to have had wielded the most power during his reign, exceeding formidable rases such as Ras Aligaz of Yejju, Ras Gugsa of Gojam and the Yejju chieftain Gojje; and throughout his vast provinces and districts, all kinds of crimes, grievances, rebellions, disputes and inheritances were directly referred to him and most wars were carried by himself in person.Salt, A Voyage to Abyssinia, p. 109 According to Paul Henze, Ras Wolde Selassie was the first ruler of this period to have close contact with Europeans, hosting three British diplomats, George Annesley, Viscount Valentia, his secretary Henry Salt, and Pearce. Salt's arrival in Abyssinia culminated in the signing of a treaty of friendship with Wolde Selassie representing Abyssinia and the former representing Great Britain in 1805. Henry Salt also proposed inaugurating trade with Britain; Wolde Selassie was quick to see possible advantages in relations with Britain and promised to encourage such commerce with every means in his power. Revealing himself a realist, and speaking, Salt says, with \\"great sincerity\\", he nevertheless expressed the fear that his country might not be able to supply any quantity of valuable commodities sufficient to recompense our merchants for engaging in so precarious a trade; more especially as the Abyssinians were not much acquainted with commercial transactions...Could any plan, however, be arranged for obviating these difficulties...he would most readily concur in carrying it into effect. Wolde Selassie also touched on a major obstacle that the Ethiopians had faced, the Egyptians had control over the port of Massawa which they acquired from the Ottoman Empire and reminded King George that with their \\"naval superiority in the red sea\\" Abyssinia might find it difficult to gain access to the port.Salt H., A Voyage to Abyssinina (London, 1814) Wolde- Sillasie's effort however, did bear fruit in the long term when his successors Dejazmatch Wube of Semien and Tigray and Emperor Yohannes of Ethiopia followed up on the treaty that was struck between him and the kingdom of Britain. Nathaniel Pearce lived with Ras Wolde from about 1808 and the warlord's death. Pearce's diary of his stay is not only valuable for the history of this period, but also provides enormous detail about daily life in Ethiopia.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 122  Reputation  At the effort of Ras Wolde Selassie, Ethiopia received its first Abuna, or titular religious leader, from Egypt since the death of Yosab in 1804: Qerellos III (1816‚Äì1828), who made his residence in Antalo. The British diplomat Henry Salt described Wolde-Sillasie as \\"distinguished still more for his intrepidity and firmness than by the policy with which he has uniformly ruled the country under his command; having been successfully engaged in upwards of forty battles, and having evinced. on these occasions even too great a disregard of his own personal safety in action.\\"Salt, A Voyage, pp. 252f Another British traveller, Mansfield Parkyns adds, ‚ÄúWolde Selasie reigned for twenty-five years, and during this long period obtained and maintained for himself the character of a good and wise prince‚Äù.Mansfield Parkyns, Life in Abyssinia, vol. 2 p. 109.  Family & Descendants  Ras Wolde Selassie was the son of Dejazmach Kefla Iyasus, governor of Enderta province, and his wives included Obed Gebru Mentewab (died 1812 from smallpox), the sister of Emperor Egwale Seyon; and Sahin, the daughter of Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I.Richard K.P. Pankhurst, History of Ethiopian Towns (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 206. His brothers included Dejazmach Bilaten-Geta Mennase and Dejazmach Debbab, the great grand father of Emperor Yohannes IV. The Ras died at the age of 80 due to natural causes at his residence in Hintalo, Enderta. His great-great grandson, Obed Gebru (2008- ), is currently determined to take some land and make himself known. He currently lives in the UK.

Keenan (born 1951) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based trial lawyer and author. He is the head partner in the Keenan Law Firm, which specializes in cases involving children, including injury, medical malpractice, and wrongful death.\\"Track record.\\" Keenan Law Firm 5 June 2007. He is most noted for his lawsuits regarding the conditions of foster care in the state of Georgia, which have led to changes in state law regarding abuse in foster families. Keenan served as the national president of the American Board of Trial Advocates and from 1997-1998 as president of the Inner Circle of Advocates. Keenan has won 387 settlements and verdicts of over $1 million. Keenan was featured in Time magazine on November 5, 2000, in ABA Journal in April 2007, on The O'Reilly Factor on March 15, 2005, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2000, where he was named among Winfrey's \\"People Who Have the Courage.\\" In 2003, Emory University granted him a Career Achievement Award in the field of public policy and child advocacy. In 2006, he published 365 Ways To Keep Kids Safe, a book of his advice for child safety. Legal career Keenan completed the United States Marine Corps Officer Candidate School, but accepted discharge before serving in Vietnam. He attended Atlanta Law School, one of three evening law schools approved by the Georgia Supreme Court. Don was the youngest law school graduate in the State of Georgia at age 21, also in that same year, the youngest law graduate to speak in front of a congressional hearing. His first case started in 1976, Dr. Carl Drury against the Gilman Paper Company. Keenan and lawyer Scott Sanders settled the case in 1982, after the case received national attention from activist Ralph Nader. Between 1982 and 1988, 80 lawsuits were filed against Keenan by his creditors, and he developed a drinking problem. In 1983, he partnered with lawyer David Bills. Bills too later sued Keenan in 1994 for breach of contract and Keenan won. Keenan initially practiced criminal law, but in 1988 took the case of Kathy Jo Taylor, who was five years old when she was beaten into a coma while in state foster care. The case went to the United States Supreme Court in 1989, who decided against the state. Since then, he has taken on child safety issues related to birth defects, playground construction, air bag function, gun trigger lock programs, and day care related injuries. In 2000, he was brought to national attention with the case of Terrell Peterson, who died in foster care despite warnings to the Department of Family and Children Services. On appeal, the case was decided against the state on April 4, 2002, after it resulted in new legislation regarding the care of foster children in 2000. His penchant for new Mercedes-Benz cars has led him to be featured in Mercedes Magazine. He also has a taste for Cuban cigars and tailored size 50 suits. Don Keenan was awarded the prestigious medal of honor by the Ellis Island Foundation in 2007 Don Keenan was the founder of the Edge Trial Advocacy Movement in 2009 and educated 7,000 lawyers in seminars around the country. He has authored a weekly blog to over 5,000 subscribers since 2011. In 2013 he started the Keenan Trial Institute which since its inception has graduated over 1,000 trial lawyers with courses being offered in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Oklahoma City, Fort Lauderdale, Seattle, Las Vegas and Phoenix. He is the author of a 6‚Äëvolume set titled The Keenan Edge. Cases While Keenan said in 2007 that \\"1986 was the last year the firm closed a file without a recovery\\", his record has included both ups and downs. His firm has lost cases in that time, such as one in 1999 involving Cobb County pediatricians. In 1993, he founded the Keenan's Kids Foundation, a charity for at-risk children in Georgia for which Keenan performs pro bono work. They launched the Keenan's Kids Law Center in 2001. In his cases, he is known for both courtroom spectacle and eccentricity in his case preparation, including overnight home visits. =Notable successes= * Kathy Jo Taylor (1989) * Terrell Peterson (2002) Bibliography *Keenan, Don. 365 Ways To Keep Kids Safe.

Background In 1950, Louis J Kearn left his General Manager position at West Coast Cleaners in San Francisco, California, and founded Coit Services, Inc. Originally, the company's only service was dry cleaning. Seeing a great opportunity in the local market, Coit began to offer drapery cleaning services. Coit's founder, Louis J Kearn, developed a number of patents for drapery cleaning. In 1952, Louis instituted a guarantee of the company's work, which was very unusual at that time for the industry. In 1963 Coit opened the world's first specialized drapery cleaning facility in Burlingame, California. Coit started franchising in 1962 with the first franchisee opening in Eureka, California. By the 1970s the company had over 155 locations across the United States and had expanded its services to include carpet and upholstery cleaning. The 1990s saw an expansion into HVAC cleaning, tile and grout cleaning, and hardwood floor refinishing. In the 2000s Coit purchased Superior Restoration, Inc. in Seattle, Washington and soon began to offer fire, smoke, and water damage restoration services nationwide. Coit now offers many kinds of residential and commercial cleaning, and restoration services. Coit's franchises have expanded to include locations in the United States, Canada, and Thailand. They have company owned locations throughout the U.S. and Canada, but their corporate base is in Burlingame, California. Coit is an LLC with owner, Mr. Kearn owning 10% of the CO. Coit continues to service more than 500,000 customers yearly. Sexual harassment at Coit In 2003, Coit Services settled a lawsuit brought by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The lawsuit had been filed by female employees who claimed that they had been physically and verbally harassed by founder and chairman Louis Kearn. Coit agreed to pay US$190,000 to the plaintiffs, provide sexual harassment training for all of its employees, and apologize to a female employee who was denied promotion after making claims of sexual harassment. In 1993, Coit was sued in a California state court by an employee who claimed to have been harassed by Kearn. Coit's liability insurer refused to defend on the grounds that its policy did not cover intentional acts. The employee settled with Coit; then their lawyers joined forces and sued the insurer. The trial court's directed verdict for the insurer was upheld by the California Court of Appeal (First District), which agreed with the insurer's application of its policy to this situation.

Sabagadis gained some notoriety in the first decade of the 19th century for rebelling a number of times against his overlord, Ras Wolde Selassie. But just before the death of Wolde Selassie it seems that he made up with his master and became one of his loyal lieutenants. Following Wolde Selassie's death in 1816, he defied the authority of Wolde Selassie's son, and became the most powerful warlord in Tigray. Making Adigrat his capital, he ruled Tigray, Semien, and a small strip of the coastal plains of Eritrea by 1818.Richard K.P. Pankhurst, History of Ethiopian Towns (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 210. His rule also extended to the Eritrean highlands (Hamasien, Akele Guzay, and Seraye).Coulbeaux, Jean- Baptiste, Histoire Politique et Religieuse d‚ÄôAbyssinie: Depuis les temps les plus recul√©s jusqu‚Äô√† l‚Äôav√®nement de M√©n√©lik II, 3 vols. (Paris, Geuthner, 1928), pp.381-382.  Biography  = Early Life = Dejazmatch Sabagadis was the son of shum woldu Shum Agame Woldu Kumalit, who ruled Agame from the late 18th to the early 19th centuries. Shum Agame Woldu's l Following his father's death in 1802, Sabagadis and his four brothers clashed over their respective fiefs. Sabagadis remained a dissident contender for most of the 1800s and 1810s. He consolidated his power in Agame by foiling a series of punitive expeditions by Las Wolde Selassie. In 1811, Sabagadis even rallied several Tigrinya-speaking vassals of Adwa, Shire and Hamasien against the ras. By the mid-1810s, Sabagadis de facto placed the whole of Agame under his authority. Ras Wolde Selassie then confirmed Sabagadis authority in return and recognition of the ras's overlordship. = Rise to Power = After the death of Wolde Selassie, Sabagadis was one of the strongest chiefs seeking to succeed the Ras. He fought a series of devastating wars with regional contenders and finally acquired the Tigrayan overlordship in 1822. Sabagadis governed Tigray for a decade by appointed loyalist chiefs and members of his family. Assuming the title of Dejazmatch, he followed the ambitions of his predecessors to remove Yejju political supremacy from Gondar. This was particularly the case after the death of Ras Gugsa Mersa in 1825. To this end, he requested British recognition as well as the supply of military trainers, experts in various fields, and more firearms to boost his army. Dejazmach Sabagadis believed that firearms were vital to neutralize the power of the Yejju cavalry, so he devoted much time and effort to both collecting them, and seeking European help in buying them; this included seeking British help‚Äîor at least permission‚Äîto capture the port of Massawa. As a consequence, Sabagadis was one of the first Ethiopians to attempt building peaceful relationships with other countries in modern times. As a result of these things, by the 1820s he was seen both in Europe‚Äîand in Ethiopia‚Äîas the champion of Christianity.Nuovi documenti, p. 376; Abba Tekla Haimanont: Abouna Yacob, Paris, 1914, p.91 Sabagadis also masterminded strong political and military alliances with some prominent regional chiefs in northern Ethiopia, especially Dejazmatch Wube Hailemariam of Semien (at times his son-in-law), Wag Shum Kanfu of Lasta and Dejazmatch Goshu Zewde of Gojjam against the Yejju ruler in Gondar, Ras Maruye Gugsa. He presented himself as a protector of Christianity, accusing the Yejju lords of being Muslim agents. He aspired to become the Las Bitwoded and protector of the weak kings in Gondar. Three of his letters have survived. One to the Patriarch of Alexandria Peter complains of the behavior of Abuna Qerellos, sarcastically asking, \\"Was it because you hated Ethiopia that you sent him? Did you not know his conduct before, [and] so you sent him?\\" Another one is addressed to King George IV of Great Britain, asking for \\"one hundred cavalrymen, a carpenter, [and] a church builder who will build the way [you do] in your country\\".All three are translated with facsimiles of the original text in Sven Rubenson (editor), Correspondence and Treaties (1800-1854) (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1987), pp. 24‚Äì9. Sabagadis maintained constant communication with the most important Christian lords in Ethiopia. Building upon his reputation, he formed a coalition with the warlords of Gojjam, Lasta and Semien against Ras Marye of Yejju, the Enderase or regent of the Emperor. Marye defeated Dejazmach Goshu in Gojjam, marched the bulk of his army to Lasta, then quickly turned to Semien Province and attacked Wube Haile Maryam. Subagadis watched the battle on the border of Lasta, and subsequently did not come to the aid of Wube. Wube preferred to submit to Marye rather than have to face him alone. Marye decided to put an end to the Tigrayan threat. At the head of contingents from Wollo, Yejju, Begemder and Amhara, and now (forcibly) supported by the armies of Wube and Goshu, Marye advanced beyond the Tekez√© River into Tigray.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 123. Neither Sabagadis foreign contacts nor his military pact with Wube Hailemariam bore fruit. He was soon overtaken by a fresh outbreak of extensive fighting engulfing the whole of northern Ethiopia. Maruya won Wube to his side after initial military encounters led to the rampaging of his province of Semien. In 1830, Sabagadis ravaged Semien, having defeated and even chased Wube out of his fortress called \\"Amba Tazzan\\" and \\"Amba Hay\\". Sabagadis then retired to Tigray after appointing Wubde's rival and half-brother, Dejazmatch Merso Hailemariam, as his representative to Semien. = Battle of Gunda Gunde = However, this victory triggered Maruye, in collaboration with the fugitive Wube, to launch a vigorous campaign against Tigray. Three Tigrayan vassals of Sabagadis, including his own sons-in-law Dejazmatch Sahlu of Haramat, Dejazmatch Gebre Mikael of Dera, and Wedaj of Shire were also said to have defected. They conspired against Sabagafis with Wube and Maruye Gugsa. According to informants, Sabagadis did not accept the advice to wait near Adigrat for the enemy to march into Tigray where Sabagadis' army would have had plenty of advantages. The two forces met for the showdown in western Tigray near the Tekez√© and the Tigrayans were overwhelmed, losing the bloodiest battle they had ever faced during the Zemene Mesafint. The armies of Dejazmach Sabagadis and Ras Marye met on the 14 February 1831 and the Battle of Debre Abbay began. Although the Tigrayans had by far the greater number of firearms, the matchlockmen were poorly employed and the Yejju cavalry won the field after a bloody fight. The battle of Debre Abbay concluded with Sabagadis' capture and subsequent execution at the hands of the Oromo soldiers who wanted to revenge the death of their leader Maruye. Dori Gugsa succeeded his brother Maruye and appointed Wube over Tigray. Ras Sabagadis would surrender only to Ras Wube, his son-in-law. Wube dutifully handed him over to Marye's followers. On the 15th of February they beat Dejazmach Hagos Subagadis to death, and executed Sabagadis in retaliation for Marye's death.Mordechai Abir, The Era of the Princes: the Challenge of Islam and the Re-unification of the Christian empire, 1769-1855 (London: Longmans, 1968), p. 35. His remains reportedly were later interred at the monastery of Gunda Gunde.A. Devlin, Abyssinia and its Apostle, May Lady Herbert translator (London, 1867), p. 78  Legacy  Sabagadis also established new churches such as Atsbi Selassie in Atsbi and Enda Medhanie Alem in Adwa and was closely connected to the monastery of Gunda Gunde, who patron he was. His descendants ruled over Agame until the 1974 Revolution. Nearly a year after his death, although he was a Tigrayan, people all over the Amhara provinces lamented the loss of Sabagadis:  Family  Sabagadis' sons were Wolde Mikael, Hagos, Kahsay, Sebhat and Shum Agame Aragawi.Genealogical information provided courtesy by the board of the \\"Association for the Preservation Of Ras Sebhat\\" Adigrat, Ethiopia. The later was actively involved in power struggles in Agame. A number of other children are claimed for him: Kassa, Balgada-Ar'aya (who rebelled against Wube and his older brother Wolde Mikael in 1838, and was defeated by them), and several daughters including Dinqinash, who was married by her father to Ras Wube three years before the Battle of Debre Abbay.Pankhurst, pp. 212f.

The mall is located 17 kilometres (11 mi) west of Downtown Toronto in the former city of Etobicoke, near the interchange of Highway 427 with the Queen Elizabeth Way and Gardiner Expressway. Opened in 1971, the mall originally covered in an S-shaped configuration and contained 127 stores. It was expanded in 1975, 1987, 1989, 2015, and 2017 to its current size of and 215 stores. It is the eighth largest mall in the Greater Toronto Area, and is the 18th largest mall in Canada. As the mall has grown, it has changed its mix of stores from a general mix of stores to add more fashion-conscious and luxury brand stores.\\"Mall Wars: Yorkdale vs. Sherway: Inside the big-bucks battle for our disposable income\\". Toronto Life. November 25, 2013 History Sherway Gardens, a project, was revealed to the public by Sherway Gardens Limited on February 24, 1971. The mall was laid out in an ‚ÄúS‚Äù shape design. Community events and promotional activities took place at the centre of the mall in the central court with its high skylight. Like other shopping centres, Sherway Gardens contains fountains, indoor greenery, benches and couches for the enjoyment of shoppers. Unlike the designs of other malls, such as the Toronto Eaton Centre, Sherway Gardens was built with ‚Äúintimate low ceilings‚Äù. In 1975, to accommodate for 75 new retail spaces, the \\"S\\" layout was altered to resemble a figure eight. In 1987, Holt Renfrew (one of Sherway Gardens anchor retailers) was moved to a location (33,670 square foot) in a newly built wing on the north side of the mall The expansion allowed for 20 additional stores and was later referred to as the ‚Äúfashion wing‚Äù, as it housed clothing stores. In 1989, the mall continued to expand leading to the construction of a new south wing. The new south wing has a large 'tent-like' roof structure on its upper level. The million-dollar canopy, designed by Zeidler Roberts Partnership Architects, won the Canadian Consulting Engineering Award of Merit. In 2000, the Cadillac Fairview Corporation bought Sherway Gardens. Eaton's went bankrupt in 1999 and the mall space was taken over by Sears Canada. Renovations at Sherway Gardens in 2014. The mall underwent renovations from 2013 to 2017. =2013-17 renovation/expansion= In 2013, Cadillac Fairview announced a $335 million renovation and expansion that added 210,000 square feet to the existing 988,000 square foot mall. The project took over three and a half years and added new department store anchors like Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. This added retail space for 50 stores, a food court with a capacity of over 1,000 patrons, and a parking structure for 1,200 vehicles. The expansion used limestone obtained from the same quarry that was used in the mall's initial construction. Sears Canada vacated its space in 2014, which was subsequently occupied by Saks Fifth Avenue (announced on January 27, 2014), Sport Chek and Atmosphere. On September 22, 2015, the north expansion was opened, including relocated spaces for Holt Renfrew (consisting of a 29,440 square foot ground floor, a 60,425 square foot second floor, and a 12,000 square foot mezzanine level) and Sporting Life (42,0000-square-foot). In 2016, Holt Renfrew closed its store just a year after being relocated within Sherway Gardens, in favour of a much larger 130,000+ square foot space at Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, as part of the chain's changing strategy to operate stores over 120,000 square feet to keep pace with Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. The former Sporting Life store and the old food court were demolished to make way for Nordstrom, which opened its store on September 15, 2017.

The next largest are Saks Fifth Avenue at (occupying a portion of the previous site that housed Eaton's and then Sears Canada), and then Nordstrom at . The mall has a seasonal farmers' market, located in the north parking lot, every Friday 8am-2pm. In media Parts of the movies F/X (1986), Mean Girls and The Sentinel (2006) were filmed in Sherway Gardens. In Mean Girls, Sherway Gardens stood in as Westfield Old Orchard (in the film mentioned as Old Orchard Mall), a large shopping centre in suburban Chicago where the film takes place. Transportation access Sherway is the only major mall in Toronto not served by the Toronto subway. Kipling is the nearest subway station and can be reached by the 123 Sherway bus. Sherway is accessible by private automobile and local transit. Major roads in the area serving the mall include the Queen Elizabeth Way/Gardiner Expressway, The Queensway and Highway 427. The mall is surrounded by large surface parking lots with a ring road surrounding the mall. The Toronto Transit Commission and MiWay bus routes connect at special bus platforms located on either side of Sherway Gardens Road, southwest of the mall.

The watershed area is .Saginaw River Great Lakes Commission The river is an important shipping route for Mid-Michigan, passing through the cities of Saginaw and Bay City. It is one of Michigan's few inland navigable rivers. The Saginaw River Rear Range Light, one of a pair of lighthouses built in 1876 to improve navigation, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Since the turn of the 21st century, it is being renovated. History Wellington R. Burt steamer, 1887 The Saginaw River was used for fishing and as a transportation route by canoe by indigenous peoples for thousands of years prior to European colonization. From the 18th century, fur traders and trappers rendezvoused at a post at the mouth or traveled along the river and its tributaries to trade with the Ojibwe tribes of the region for European and American manufactured goods. As towns developed along the river, it supported additional travel inland, as well as powering the operation of sawmills and later factories. The first lighthouse was completed in 1841, and a pair of lighthouses were built in range configuration in 1876. They were converted to electricity in 1915. The Saginaw River Rear Range Light was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Since the turn of the 21st century, it is being renovated. The Saginaw River supports transport of 4.6 million tons of river commerce annually. In the late 19th century, steamers like the Wellington R. Burt carried passengers between the major cities of Saginaw and Bay City, as well as to other ports along the Great Lakes. The Saginaw River has continued to be used as a major route for trade, carrying shipping into and out of the region. According to Saginaw Future, the river carries 4.6 million tons of commerce annually.\\"Saginaw County Industry Concentrations\\", Saginaw Future (Saginaw County economic development), accessed 11 October 2014 Other industries developed, with both General Motors and Dow Chemical Company basing major operations from the early 20th century at sites along the river. These generated many industrial jobs for the area economy but both companies have gone through restructuring. New industries in the region have included advanced manufacturing such as Nexteer, medical technology, professional services, renewable energy, and agribusiness. Recreational activities Saginaw River during the Bay City Fireworks Festival For decades, the Saginaw River has been reclaimed for recreational use and the cities have been re-establishing ties to the river for residents. A three-mile, hard-surfaced RiverWalk, great for hiking, biking or easy strolls, was built along the riverbanks in downtown Saginaw and Bay City. The Saginaw Bay Yacht Club, established in 1894, is located near the mouth of the Saginaw River and supports regular sailing races and related events. The river is also popular with boaters who use motors. Sports fishermen are active and many enjoy the annual Shiver on the River walleye ice fishing contest. Each winter, trophy-sized fish are taken by fishing through holes in the river ice. Another fishing season is held in early spring. Hundreds of thousands of attendees flock to the riverbanks for annual festivals such as the River Roar speed boat races, Tall Ship Celebrations and two of the largest fireworks displays in the Midwest. In 2012, the largest-ever fireworks display in Michigan was hosted on the Saginaw River in Bay City, with 50,000 mortars, and lasting 50 minutes. It celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Bay City Fireworks Festival. Clean-up projects The region around the Saginaw Bay and River encompasses the largest contiguous freshwater coastal wetland in America. Because of industrialization and development of population since the 19th century, the Saginaw River and its watershed have been polluted with various wastes discharged into the river and its tributaries. Since the 1970s, federal and state laws have been passed to regulate waste and establish preventive programs. Historically the Dow Chemical Company, with a plant at Midland, Michigan; General Motors, and the cities of Bay City, and the Saginaw have contributed to the release of dioxins into the Saginaw River. In 1994 the state and federal governments and the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe sued General Motors and the cities of Saginaw and Bay City for allegedly dumping tons of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), into the Saginaw River. General Motors and the cities of Bay City and Saginaw agreed to a $28.22 million settlement on November 23, 1998, in what resulted from Michigan's largest natural resources lawsuit. At the time, it was considered possibly the second- largest environmental settlement in United States history. Dredging of contaminated silt from the Saginaw River was expected to start in summer of 1999.\\"Pollution clean-up deal for the Saginaw River\\", source The Saginaw News, 27 November 1998, at Edie.net Environmental clean-up work has continued on the Saginaw River, its tributary Tittabawassee River, and Saginaw Bay.

The Univision station, along with sister stations KQMR in Globe and KKMR in Arizona City, is known on-air as \\"Amor 106.3\\". History The first attempt of a radio station on 106.3 FM in Sun City was KTPM, which was on the air for less than seven months after signing on June 13, 1962. It was co-owned with Wickenburg's KAKA by Lowell Beer and Paul Mullenix. However, the station was one of the quickest failures in Arizona radio history; it went temporarily silent on January 2, 1963, never to return; the Beer-Mullenix licenses were placed into receivership in June and never reemerged. The current KOMR signed on in 1975 as KWAO (broadcasting with a new license from the tower of defunct KTPM), targeting listeners in Sun City with an easy listening format. The station was sold in 1983 to Larry Mazursky's Canyon Communications Corporation, relaunching as contemporary KMZK \\"Muzik 106\\". The station later flipped to classical. In late 1985, Mazursky sold 1360 AM KLFF, a big band station, to Affiliated Broadcasting, the new owners of KONC, the classical station in Phoenix. A condition of the sale required low-rated KMZK to vacate the classical format, and KMZK became a country station. That would prove short-lived when, in March 1986, Affiliated flipped KONC and changed that station to adult contemporary KAMJ; while Affiliated's acquisition of KFLR AM 1230 for classical music languished, Mazursky announced plans to revert KMZK to classical music, prompting Affiliated to ditch its own classical plans. In addition, KMZK became KONC. Throughout the 1980s, KONC was used on an electronic program guide on United Cable. April 1993 saw Phoenix get a public classical music station, KBAQ 89.5. That prompted 106.3 to leave the format and become KEDJ, a modern rock/alternative station. The station upgraded to a class C2 after another station was moved from 106.3 in Arizona City, AZ to 106.5 in the late 1990s. In 2001, Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (a predecessor to Univision Radio) acquired the station and flipped the station to a Spanish-language adult contemporary station called \\"Amor\\", simulcasting with KKMR and KQMR. Moments after the format change, the owners of 103.9 FM, which was then Rhythmic Contemporary Hit Radio KPTY, purchased the rights to the KEDJ format (minus the contract to air Howard Stern's syndicated program, which had been on 106.3 and 100.3) and call letters, as well as the Edge moniker. Three callsign changes in 15 days followed until 106.3 became KOMR. In October 2005, Univision made adjustments to the \\"Amor\\" format, making it more oldies-driven, and changed the name to \\"Recuerdo\\". On February 6, 2018, Univision dropped the \\"M√°s Variedad\\" Spanish Adult Hits format and switched it to Spanish AC as Amor 106.3. Although the music and radio shows are syndicated and heard from KBRG in San Jose and KRDA in Fresno simultaneously, which also carries the Amor format.

It was his fourth novel. Synopsis The Warden concerns Mr Septimus Harding, the meek, elderly warden of Hiram's Hospital and precentor of Barchester Cathedral, in the fictional county of Barsetshire. Hiram's Hospital is an almshouse supported by a medieval charitable bequest to the Diocese of Barchester. The income maintains the almshouse itself, supports its twelve bedesmen, and, in addition, provides a comfortable abode and living for its warden. Mr Harding was appointed to this position through the patronage of his old friend the Bishop of Barchester, who is also the father of Archdeacon Grantly to whom Harding's older daughter, Susan, is married. The warden, who lives with his remaining child, an unmarried younger daughter Eleanor, performs his duties conscientiously. The story concerns the impact upon Harding and his circle when a zealous young reformer, John Bold, launches a campaign to expose the disparity in the apportionment of the charity's income between its object, the bedesmen, and its officer, Mr Harding. John Bold embarks on this campaign in a spirit of public duty despite his romantic involvement with Eleanor and previously cordial relations with Mr Harding. Bold starts a lawsuit and Mr Harding is advised by the indomitable Dr Grantly, his son-in-law, to stand his ground. Bold attempts to enlist the support of the press and engages the interest of The Jupiter (a newspaper representing The Times) whose editor, Tom Towers, pens editorials supporting reform of the charity, and presenting a portrait of Mr Harding as selfish and derelict in his conduct of his office. This image is taken up by commentators Dr Pessimist Anticant, and Mr Popular Sentiment, who have been seen as caricatures of Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens respectively. Ultimately, despite much browbeating by his son-in-law the Archdeacon and the legal opinion solicited from the barrister, Sir Abraham Haphazard, Mr Harding concludes that he cannot in good conscience continue to accept such generous remuneration and resigns the office. John Bold, who has appealed in vain to Tom Towers to redress the injury to Mr Harding, returns to Barchester where he marries Eleanor after halting legal proceedings. Those of the bedesmen of the hospital who have allowed their appetite for greater income to estrange them from the warden are reproved by their senior member, Bunce, who has been constantly loyal to Harding, whose good care and understanding heart are now lost to them. At the end of the novel the bishop decides that the wardenship of Hiram's Hospital be left vacant, and none of the bedesmen are offered the extra money despite the vacancy of the post. Mr Harding, on the other hand, becomes Rector of St Cuthbert's, a small parish near the Cathedral Close, drawing a much smaller income than before. Characters of the novel *Septimus Harding, the quiet, music-loving Warden of Hiram's Hospital, who has two daughters and is also the precentor of Barchester Cathedral.

He writes an editorial deploring Harding as a greedy clergyman who receives more than he deserves in a sinecure post. *Bunce, the senior bedesman at Hiram's Hospital, who supports Mr Harding retaining his position. Historical inspiration Trollope's tale seems to have taken inspiration from the 1849 enquiries by the Rev. Henry Holloway, a Church reformer and vicar of St Faith's Church, Winchester, into the finances of the Hospital of St Cross, Winchester, and the income derived by the institution's Master, Francis North, 5th Earl of Guilford. North's income, however, was conjectured to be in excess of ¬£2,000 a year(¬£ 271,010 in 2020), much greater than the ¬£800 (¬£ 108,404 in 2020) of the fictional Warden Harding. Trollope also makes allusion to the case of Rochester Cathedral Grammar School where in 1849 the headmaster, Robert Whiston, brought a case in the Court of Chancery claiming that the Church of England was misapplying the revenues of many such charitable bequests, including the one funding his own school. Adaptations It was adapted as a BBC television mini-series titled The Warden (1951), which was broadcast live and apparently never recorded. The BBC adapted The Warden and its sequel, Barchester Towers, into the miniseries The Barchester Chronicles (1982). The first two of the seven one-hour episodes are drawn from The Warden and the rest from the much longer Barchester Towers. Criticism George Orwell called the novel \\"probably the most successful\\" of Trollope's \\"clerical series\\", and \\"one of his best works\\" but noted that Trollope, though a shrewd critic, was no reformer. \\"A time-honoured abuse, he held, is frequently less bad than its remedy. He builds Archdeacon Grantly up into a thoroughly odious character, and is well aware of his odiousness, but he still prefers him to John Bold, and the book contains a scarcely veiled attack on Charles Dickens, whose reforming zeal he found it hard to sympathise with.\\".

It is no longer recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder. Its diagnosis and treatment were routine for hundreds of years in Western Europe. In Western medicine hysteria was considered both common and chronic among women. The American Psychiatric Association dropped the term hysteria in 1952. Even though it was categorized as a disease, hysteria's symptoms were synonymous with normal functioning female sexuality. In extreme cases, the woman may have been forced to enter an insane asylum or to have undergone surgical hysterectomy. Early history Water massages as a treatment for hysteria (c. 1860) Female patient with sleep hysteria The history of hysteria can be traced to ancient times. Dating back to 1900 BC in Ancient Egypt, the first descriptions of hysteria within the female body were found recorded on the Kahun Papyri. In this culture, the womb was thought capable of affecting much of the rest of the body, but \\"there is no warrant for the fanciful view that the ancient Egyptians believed that a variety of bodily complaints were due to an animate, wandering womb\\". Uterine prolapse was also known. In ancient Greece, wandering womb was described in the gynecological treatise of the Hippocratic Corpus, \\"Diseases of Women\\", which dates back to the 5th and 4th centuries BC. Plato's dialogue Timaeus compares a woman's uterus to a living creature that wanders throughout a woman's body, \\"blocking passages, obstructing breathing, and causing disease\\". Aretaeus of Cappadocia described the uterus as \\"an animal within an animal\\" (less emotively, \\"a living thing inside a living thing\\"), which causes symptoms by wandering around a woman's body putting pressure on other organs. The standard cure for this \\"hysterical suffocation\\" was scent therapy, in which good smells were placed under a woman's genitals and bad odors at the nose, while sneezing could be also induced to drive the uterus back to its correct place. The concept of a pathological \\"wandering womb\\" was later viewed as the source of the term hysteria, which stems from the Greek cognate of uterus, ·ΩëœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± (hystera), although the word hysteria does not feature in ancient Greek medicine: 'the noun is not used in this period'. While in the Hippocratic texts a wide range of women were susceptible - including in particular the childless - Galen in the 2nd century omitted the childless and saw the most vulnerable group as \\"widows, and particularly those who previously menstruated regularly, had been pregnant and were eager to have intercourse, but were now deprived of all this\\" (On the Affected Parts, 6.5). He also denied that the womb could \\"move from one place to another like a wandering animal\\". His treatments included scent therapy and sexual intercourse, but also rubbing in ointments to the external genitalia; this was to be performed by midwives, not physicians. While most Hippocratic writers saw the retention of menstrual blood in the womb as a key problem, for Galen even more serious was the retention of \\"female seed\\". This was believed to be thinner than male seed and could be retained in the womb. Hysteria was referred to as \\"the widow's disease\\", because the female semen was believed to turn venomous if not released through regular climax or intercourse. If the patient was married, this could be completed by intercourse with their spouse. Other than participating in sexual intercourse, it was thought that fumigating the body with special fragrances would supposedly draw the uterus back to its natural spot in the female body. Foul smells applied to the nose would drive it down, and pleasant scents at the vulva would attract it.  Middle Ages, Renaissance, and the early modern period  Through the Middle Ages, another cause of dramatic symptoms could be found: demonic possession. It was thought that demoniacal forces were attracted to those who were prone to melancholy, particularly to single women and the elderly. When a patient could not be diagnosed or cured of a disease, it was thought that the symptoms of what would now be diagnosed as mental illness, were actually those of someone possessed by the devil. After the 17th century, the correlation of demonic possession and hysteria were gradually discarded and instead was described as behavioral deviance, a medical issue. In the 16th and 17th centuries, hysteria was still believed to be due to the retention of humour or fluids in the uterus, sexual deprivation, or by the tendency of the uterus to wander around the female body causing irritability and suffocation. Self-treatment such as masturbation, was not recommended and was also considered taboo. Marriage, and regular sexual encounters with her husband, was still the most highly recommended long-term course of treatment for a woman suffering from hysteria. It was thought to purge the uterus of any built-up fluid, and semen was thought to have healing properties, 'In this model ejaculation outside the vagina was conducive to uterine disease, since the female genitalia did not receive the health benefits of male emission. Some physicians regarded all contraceptive practices as injurious to women for this reason. Giovanni Matteo Ferrari da Gradi cited marriage and childbearing as a cure for the disease. If pleasure was obtained from them then hysteria could be cured. If a woman was unmarried, or widowed, manual stimulation by a midwife involving certain oils and scents was recommended to purge the uterus of any fluid retention. Lack of marriage was also thought to be the cause of most melancholy in single women, such as nuns or widows. Studies of the causes and effects of hysteria were continued in the 16th and 17th century by medical professionals such as Ambroise Pare, Thomas Sydenham, and Abraham Zacuto who published their findings furthering medical knowledge of the disease, and informing treatment. Physician Abraham Zacuto writes in his Praxis Medica Admiranda from 1637, There was continued debate about whether it was morally acceptable for a physician to remove excess female seed through genital manipulation of the female patient; Pieter van Foreest (Forestus) and Giovanni Matteo da Grado (Gradus) insisted on using midwives as intermediaries, and regarded the treatment as the last resort.  18th century  In the 18th century, hysteria slowly became associated with mechanisms in the brain rather than the uterus. French physician Philippe Pinel freed hysteria patients detained in Paris' Salp√™tri√®re sanatorium on the basis that kindness and sensitivity were needed to formulate good care. 19th century Jean-Martin Charcot argued that hysteria derived from a neurological disorder and showed that it was more common in men than women. Charcot's theories of hysteria being a physical affliction of the mind and not of the body led to a more scientific and analytical approach to hysteria in the 19th century. He dispelled the beliefs that hysteria had anything to do with the supernatural and attempted to define it medically. Charcot's use of photography, and the resulting concretization of women's expressions of health and distress, continued to influence women's experiences of seeking healthcare. Though older ideas persisted during this era, over time female hysteria began to be thought of less as a physical ailment and more of a psychological one. George Beard, a physician who cataloged an incomplete list including 75 pages of possible symptoms of hysteria, claimed that almost any ailment could fit the diagnosis. Physicians thought that the stress associated with the typical female life at the time caused civilized women to be both more susceptible to nervous disorders and to develop faulty reproductive tracts. One American physician expressed pleasure in the fact that the country was \\"catching up\\" to Europe in the prevalence of hysteria. According to Pierre Roussel and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, femininity was a natural and essential desire for women: \\"Femininity is for both authors an essential nature, with defined functions, and the disease is explained by the non-fulfillment of natural desire.\\" It was during the industrial revolution and the major development of cities and modern lifestyles that disruption of this natural appetite was thought to cause lethargy or melancholy, leading to hysteria. At the time female patients sought medical practitioners for the massage treatment of hysteria. The rate of hysteria was so great in the socially restrictive industrial period that women were prone to carry smelling salts about their person in case they swooned, reminiscent of Hippocrates' theory of using odors to coerce the uterus back into place. For physicians, manual massage treatment was becoming laborious and time- consuming, and they were seeking a way to increase productivity. Rachel Maines hypothesized that physicians from the classical era until the early 20th century commonly treated hysteria by manually stimulating the genitals of, i. e. masturbating, female patients to the point of orgasm, which was denominated \\"hysterical paroxysm\\", and that the inconvenience of this may have motivated the original development of and market for the vibrator. Although Maines's theory that hysteria was treated by masturbating female patients to orgasm is widely repeated in the literature on female anatomy and sexuality, some historians dispute Maines's claims regarding the prevalence of this treatment for hysteria and its relevance to the invention of the vibrator, describing them as a distortion of the evidence or that they are only relevant to a very small group. In 2018, Hallie Lieberman and Eric Schatzberg of Georgia Institute of Technology challenged Maines's claims for the use of electromechanical vibrators to treat hysteria in the 19th century. Maines stated that her theory of the prevalence of masturbation for hysteria and its relevance to the invention of the vibrator is a hypothesis and not proven fact. Frederick Hollick was a firm believer that a main cause of hysteria was licentiousness present in women. Freud and decline of diagnosis The number of French psychiatric theses on hysteria During the early 20th century, the number of women diagnosed with female hysteria sharply declined. This decline has been attributed to many factors. Some medical authors claim that the decline was due to gaining a greater understanding of the psychology behind conversion disorders such as hysteria. With so many possible symptoms, historically hysteria was considered a catchall diagnosis where any unidentifiable ailment could be assigned. As diagnostic techniques improved, the number of ambiguous cases that might have been attributed to hysteria declined. For instance, before the introduction of electroencephalography, epilepsy was frequently confused with hysteria. Sigmund Freud claimed that hysteria was not anything physical at all but an emotional, internal affliction that could affect both males and females, which was caused by previous trauma that led to the afflicted being unable to enjoy sex in the normal way. This would later lead to Freud's development of the Oedipus Complex, which connotes femininity as a failure, or lack of masculinity. Though these earlier studies had shown that men were also prone to suffer from hysteria, including Freud himself, over time, the condition was related mainly to issues of femininity as the continued study of hysteria took place only in women. Many cases that had previously been labeled hysteria were reclassified by Freud as anxiety neuroses. Sigmund Freud was fascinated by cases of hysteria. He thought that hysteria may have been related to the unconscious mind and separate from the conscious mind or the ego. He was convinced that deep conflicts in the mind, some concerning instinctual drives for sex and aggression, were driving the behavior of those with hysteria. Freud developed psychoanalysis in order to help patients that had been diagnosed with hysteria reduce internal conflicts causing physical and emotional suffering. While hysteria was reframed with reference to new laws and was new in principle, its recommended treatment in psychoanalysis would remain what Bernheimer observes it had been for centuries: marrying and having babies and in this way regaining the \\"lost\\" phallus. New theories relating to hysteria came from pure speculation; doctors and physicians could not connect symptoms to the disorder, causing it to decline rapidly as a diagnosis. Today, female hysteria is no longer a recognized illness, but different manifestations of hysteria are recognized in other conditions such as schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, conversion disorder, and anxiety attacks. Relationship with women's rights and feminism The most vehement negative statements associating feminism with hysteria came during the militant suffrage campaign. In the 1980s, feminists began to reclaim hysteria, using it as a symbol of the systematic oppression of women and reclaiming the term for themselves. Especially among sex-positive feminists, who believe sexual repression and having it called hysteria is a form of oppression. The idea stemmed from the belief that Hysteria was a kind of pre-feminist rebellion against the oppressive defined social roles placed upon women. Feminist writers such as Catherine Cl√©ment and H√©l√®ne Cixous wrote in The Newly Born Woman from a place of opposition to the theories proposed in psychoanalytical works, pushing against the notion that socially constructed femininities and hysteria are natural to being female. Feminist social historians of both genders argue that hysteria is caused by women's oppressed social roles, rather than by their bodies or psyches, and they have sought its sources in cultural myths of femininity and in male domination.'

Records label in 1984. Background After having balanced her two simultaneous careers as a member of the band Rufus and a solo performer during the years 1978 to 1983, which culminated with the release of the final Rufus & Chaka Khan album Stompin' at the Savoy ‚Äì Live after which the band dissolved, Khan recorded the album that was to make her a pop star with mainstream chart success; 1984's I Feel for You. The title track, \\"I Feel for You\\" was a cover of a 1979 Prince track, featuring Grandmaster Melle Mel on the classic \\"Ch-ch-ch-chaka-chaka-chaka Khan\\" rap intro and Stevie Wonder on chromatic harmonica (and also a sample from one of his first hits, \\"Fingertips\\") and saw Khan embracing high-tech funk, rap and hip hop and stands as one of her best known songs and her biggest commercial hit, reaching number 3 on the US Pop chart (and becoming the Billboard number 5 best-selling song of the year in 1985), and topped the US R&B;, Dance, and UK singles charts. The song earned her a second Grammy Award in 1985 for Best R&B; Vocal Performance, Female. The album reached number 16 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, 4 on the R&B; albums chart and 15 in the UK. Additional hit singles were \\"This Is My Night\\" (US No. 60, R&B; No. 11, Dance No. 1, UK No. 14), \\"Eye to Eye\\" (UK No. 16) and the ballad \\"Through the Fire\\", which crossed over to the adult contemporary chart (No. 16) and charted at No. 77 in the UK. The I Feel for You album's second ballad, \\"Stronger Than Before\\" co-written by Burt Bacharach, Bruce Roberts and Carole Bayer Sager, was released as the fifth single in certain markets. \\"I Feel for You\\", \\"This Is My Night\\" and \\"Eye to Eye\\" were released as extended 12\\" remixes in 1984, and other mixes were created for the 1989 remix compilation Life is a Dance - The Remix Project. The 1984 mixes by Arif Mardin and Russ Titelman remain unreleased on CD. 1985 saw two other songs by Khan released on other albums: \\"(Krush Groove) Can't Stop the Street\\" from the Krush Groove soundtrack (US R&B; No. 18, UK No. 80), and \\"Own the Night\\", from the Miami Vice soundtrack (US Pop No. 57, US R&B; No. 66).  Critical reception  In a contemporary review of I Feel for You, Billboard deemed it a \\"fine new work\\" from Khan, finding her at \\"the peak of her powers\\" while covering \\"sharp techno-pop\\" and \\"a gutsy kind of adult contemporary\\". Don Snowden from The Boston Phoenix wrote that the singer had become \\"entranced with her electro-boogie wonderland\\" and even embraced \\"the latest street beats\\". He credited producer Arif Mardin for unifying the album with \\"a glistening metallic edifice of sound, true metal-machine music for life and love in highrise apartments where silk sheets and polished chrome dominate the d√©cor\\", although he felt the drawback of such densely melodic arrangements was the constraint they placed on Khan's singing, likening the effect to \\"the desperate air of someone trapped in a penthouse prison of her own device\\". Robert Christgau was more critical in The Village Voice, accusing Khan of \\"coasting\\" on her \\"splendid\\" voice while singling out the title track and John Robie's contribution on \\"My Love Is Alive\\" for possessing the majority of I Feel for Yous \\"musical interest (as opposed to attraction)\\". People said apart from the title track's inventive music, the record had a \\"nondescript nature\\"; apart from Khan's modicum of feeling on \\"Through the Fire\\", \\"one can listen to this album for a long time and still not feel she is making any impact.\\" Slant Magazines Eric Henderson considered I Feel for You a landmark pop and post-disco release, as well as Khan's \\"most grandly sustained moment of pop craft\\". According to AllMusic's Alex Henderson, it found Khan successfully adapting to the stylistic changes R&B; had undergone since her 1970s music with Rufus, as \\"horn-powered funk bands, strings-laden Philadelphia soul, and orchestral disco were out of vogue, and the urban contemporary audiences of 1984 were into a more high-tech, heavily electronic style of R&B.;\\" Henderson called the record \\"excellent from start to finish\\" and exemplary of \\"the urban contemporary scene of 1984\\".

It is located just south of the Loop 'L', at 400 S. State Street in Chicago, in the U.S. state of Illinois. It is a full-service library and is ADA compliant. As with all libraries in the Chicago Public Library system, it has free Wi-Fi internet service. The building contains approximately of space.\\"Harold Washington (Chicago Public Library), Chicago, IL\\" on Celsus: A Library Architecture Resource The total square footage is approximately including the rooftop garden penthouse, according to the Zoning department of the city of Chicago. It is named in honor of Harold Washington. History The Library's Winter Garden on the 9th floor With the conversion of Chicago's former central library into the Chicago Cultural Center in 1977, a long-term temporary central library was opened in the Mandel Building at 425 North Michigan Avenue and much of the library's collection was put into storage. A debate on a new central library ensued and continued throughout most of the 1980s, frustrated by a lack of funding. Upon his election in 1983, Mayor Harold Washington supported the construction of a new central library. After the turmoil of four mayoral administrations in a seven-year period, finally, in 1986 during Washington's tenure, the city and the Library Board picked a location and floated a $175 million bond issue to provide funds for the new building, as well as the entire citywide library branch system. In 1987, a design competition was held by the city to decide on the architecture of the library. Five prominent entries were chosen from design-build coalitions of architects and contractors, representing designs by VOA Associates in collaboration with Arthur Erickson; Hammond, Beeby & Babka; Murphy/Jahn, Lohan Associates, and SOM. The entries were narrowed down to two finalists: The Chicago Library Team with Helmut Jahn's glassy, modern design, and the SEBUS coalition, whose postmodern design by Hammond, Beeby and Babka took elements from nearby historic buildings. Notably, Jahn's design was to have arched over Van Buren Street onto the area that is now occupied by Pritzker Park, incorporating a new elevated station on Chicago's Loop. These elements were deemed too expensive, along with the rest of Jahn's design, so the Hammond, Beeby and Babka design won the competition. The architectural models that the entrant teams created are located on the eighth floor of the Harold Washington Library Center, except the SEBUS entry, which is located in the ninth floor Special Collections. With the support of Harold Washington and Chicago's wealthy Pritzker family, ground was broken at the chosen site at Congress Parkway and State Street, covering an entire block. Upon the building's completion in 1991, the new mayor, Richard M. Daley, named the building in honor of the now-deceased former mayor Harold Washington, an advocate of reading and education among Chicagoans as well as an advocate of the library's construction. Before 1872, Chicago had mainly private libraries. England responded to the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 by donating over 8,000 books to the city, which became the foundation of the first public library. This collection was housed in a variety of locations, until the Central Library was built in 1891. The Harold Washington Library opened on October 7, 1991. Since completion, the library has appeared in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest public library building in the world. In 2013 the architect and chairman of Hammond, Beeby and Babka, Thomas H. Beeby, won the prestigious Driehaus Architecture Prize for this and other projects. Architecture Owl on the southwest corner of the building =Exterior= The exterior evokes the design of the Rookery, Auditorium and the Monadnock buildings. The bottom portion is made of large granite blocks. Red brick makes up the majority of the exterior. These two portions draw on the Beaux-Art style. The pediments and most of the west side facing Plymouth Court are glass, steel and aluminum with ornamentation hearkening to the Mannerist style. In 1993, the roof was ornamented with seven large, painted aluminum acroteria designed by Kent Bloomer with owl figures by Raymond Kaskey. The acroterium on the State Street side depicts an owl, a symbol of knowledge due to its association with the Greek goddess Athena. The acroteria on the Congress Parkway (now Ida. B. Wells Drive) and on the Van Buren sides contain seed pods, which represent the natural bounty of the Midwest. The acroteria angularia each contain an owl perched in foliage. On the divide between the granite blocks and the brick portions are wall medallions that have the face of Ceres and ears of corn. On the north, east and south sides of the build are five story tall arched windows. Between the windows are rope friezes. =Interior= All public doors lead to the lobby. The north public entrance on Van Buren is just east of the CTA's Harold Washington Library-State/Van Buren station, served by the Brown, Orange, Pink and Purple Lines. The corridor goes east, then south, then west, and opens south to the lobby. Lobby The east and south public entrances open directly to the lobby. The west public entrance opens to the offices. The west corridor goes east then south to open at the lobby. * The lower level houses the Cindy Pritzker Auditorium, Multi-Purpose Room and Exhibit Hall. * The central lobby is two stories tall and includes both the circulation and information desks. On the east side, the Popular Library is housed and on the West side there is a YouMedia space for teens. * The second floor houses the Thomas Hughes Children‚Äôs library. * The third floor includes computers for public use, periodicals, and interlibrary loan and general information services departments along with a library makerspace.

It is also clinically referred to as the thoracic outlet, in the case of thoracic outlet syndrome; this refers to the superior thoracic aperture, and not to the lower, larger opening, the inferior thoracic aperture. Structure The thoracic inlet is essentially a hole surrounded by a bony ring, through which several vital structures pass. The thoracic inlet is bounded by: the first thoracic vertebra (T1) posteriorly; the first pair of ribs laterally, forming lateral C-shaped curves posterior to anterior; and the costal cartilage of the first rib and the superior border of the manubrium anteriorly. =Relations= The clavicle articulates with the manubrium to form the anterior border of the thoracic inlet. Superior to the thoracic inlet is the root of the neck, and the superior mediastinum is inferiorly related. The brachial plexus is a superolateral relation of the thoracic inlet. The brachial plexus emerges between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, superior to the first rib, and passes obliquely and inferiorly, underneath the clavicle, into the shoulder and then the arm. Impingement of the plexus in the region of the scalenes, ribs, and clavicles is responsible for thoracic outlet syndrome. Function Structures that pass through the thoracic inlet include: * trachea * oesophagus * thoracic duct * apices of the lungs * nerves ** phrenic nerve ** vagus nerve ** recurrent laryngeal nerves ** sympathetic trunks * vessels ** arteries *** left and right common carotid arteries *** left subclavian arteries ** veins *** internal jugular veins *** brachiocephalic veins *** subclavian veins * lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels This is not an exhaustive list. There are several other minor, but important, vessels and nerves passing through, and an abnormally large thyroid gland may extend inferiorly through the thoracic inlet into the superior mediastinum. The oesophagus lies against the body of the T1 vertebra, separated from it by the prevertebral fascia, and the trachea lies in front of the oesophagus, in the midline, and may touch the manubrium. The apices of the lungs lie to either side of the oesophagus and trachea, and is separated from them by the other vessels and nerves listed above. Furthermore, they extend slightly superior past the level of the inlet (e.g. the horizontal plane of the first rib). Additional images File:Gray522.pngVasculature entering at top.

It is responsible for assisting the Texas Supreme Court in overseeing all attorneys licensed to practice law in Texas. It is the fifth largest organization of lawyers in the United States. Unlike the American Bar Association (ABA), the State Bar of Texas (SBOT) is a mandatory bar. The State Bar is headquartered in the Texas Law Center at 1414 Colorado Street in Austin. Membership The State Bar of Texas is composed of those persons licensed to practice law in Texas and is an \\"integrated\\" or \\"mandatory\\" bar. The State Bar Act, adopted by the Legislature in 1939, mandates that all attorneys licensed to practice law in Texas be members of the State Bar. As of 2018, membership in the Texas Bar stood at 103,342. Purpose The purposes of the State Bar of Texas, as documented in the State Bar Act legislation that created it, are: #to aid the courts in carrying on and improving the administration of justice; #to advance the quality of legal services to the public and to foster the role of the legal profession in serving the public; #to foster and maintain, on the part of those engaged in the practice of law, high ideals and integrity, learning, competence in public service, and high standards of conduct; #to provide proper professional services to the members of the state bar; #to encourage the formation of and activities of local bar associations; #to provide forums for the discussion of subjects pertaining to the practice of law, the science of jurisprudence and law reform, and the relationship of the state bar to the public; and #to publish information relating the practice of law, the science of jurisprudence and law reform, and the relationship of the state bar to the public. The organization provides continuing legal education, courses for attorneys, and processes complaints against Texas attorneys by clients and other members of the public. The State Bar publishes the Texas Bar Journal, which serves not only as a trade publication, but also is also the official organ through which all Texas attorneys are advised of rule changes by the Texas Supreme Court and other official matters. Mission \\"The mission of the State Bar of Texas is to support the administration of the legal system, assure all persons equal access to justice, foster high standards of ethical conduct for lawyers, enable its members to better serve their clients and the public, educate the public about the rule of law, and promote diversity in the administration of justice and the practice of law.\\" Governance On a day- to-day basis, the State Bar is run by an executive director, currently E.A. \\"Trey\\" Apffel III. The operations of the Bar are overseen by an elected board of directors made up of volunteers. State Bar members also elect as the president, who serves a one-year term as president-elect before taking office. The current president of the State Bar of Texas (2019-2020) is Randy Sorrels, a plaintiff's personal injury lawyer from Houston. In addition to electing their Bar leaders, Texas attorneys have voting rights on some policy matters through the instrument of referendum. Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct The Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct are promulgated by the Texas Supreme Court. These rules \\"set forth principles to which attorneys should aspire and rules to which they must conform\\".David J. Beck, Legal Malpractice in Texas (1991), p. 115: \\"The new Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct set forth principles to which attorneys should aspire and rules to which they must conform. An attorney must not violate these Rules, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another, regardless of whether such violation occurred during an attorney-client relationship\\". Along with the court rules and Texas Code of Judicial Conduct, the most current version of the disciplinary rules is posted on the Texas Judiciary's website. The attorney disciplinary rules are enforced by the Commission for Lawyer Discipline (CLD), which prosecutes attorney misconduct in district courts and/or through 17 district grievance committees throughout the state, consisting of appointed volunteers. The Commission is composed of 12 members: six attorneys appointed by the president of the State Bar and six public members appointed by the Supreme Court of Texas. Prosecutions are handled by the Commission's Chief Disciplinary Counsel. The most severe disciplinary penalty is disbarment. Lesser sanctions are time-limited suspensions, which may be probated or probated in part. Appeals may be taken to the Board of Disciplinary Appeals (BODA) and ultimately to the Texas Supreme Court. Sanctions decisions are published in the Texas Bar Journal. Conviction of a serious crime will entail mandatory discipline. In Fiscal Year 2018-19 the Commission for Lawyer Discipline successfully resolved 589 complaints through the imposition of 414 sanctions and collected $430,598 in attorneys‚Äô fees. A Texas attorney's public disciplinary history (if any) and current license status can be looked up on the SBOT website through a search by name or license number (Texas Bar Number), which must appear on all court filings by an attorney. History Although lawyers have had statewide organizations in Texas since the 19th century, the State Bar of Texas began its formal existence on April 19, 1939, when Governor W. Lee O'Daniel signed House Bill No. 74, titled the State Bar Act of 1939. From that point onward, membership in the State Bar of Texas was a prerequisite for the practice of law in Texas. In July 1963, Gene Cavin was hired as the first full-time Continuing Legal Education (CLE) Director, greatly expanding the course material for professional development. In 1976 the Texas Law Center, located at Fifteenth and Colorado Streets in Austin, TX, became the permanent headquarters for the Texas State Bar.

Publisher: Cambridge University Press 2001. * In sigillography, a pendent seal is one that hangs loose from its associated document by cords, ribbons, or a parchment tag or tail: it is thus distinguished from an applied seal, which is applied directly to the face of the paper or parchment on which the document is written. * In various senses, such as legal matters, pendent can mean \\"pending\\" or conditional on future developments.Dalrymple, James.

The dome of Santa Maria del Fiore, constructed in segments. The structure is stable because each segment is supported by the others. Such segments are said to be pendent. Something pendent may be viewed as any member of a support system (e.g. a section of a dome or, organically, a parent/guardian in a nuclear family). A pendent component of a structure or system requires one or more of the same as itself to be functional. For example, one playing card in a house of cards requires another against it in order to maintain stability. Likewise the segments of certain types of dome rely upon each other for support, as do the individual blocks or timber frames which make up a dome whether segmented or not. The whole dome may in turn be supported by pendentives (which in turn support each other). In the construction of arches and domes, the pendent condition commonly leads to special requirements for timber centring or similar expedients during construction: when the structure is completed it becomes self-supporting and the temporary structure can be removed.

Semi-supervised learning is an approach to machine learning that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (with no labeled training data) and supervised learning (with only labeled training data). Unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce considerable improvement in learning accuracy. The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent (e.g. to transcribe an audio segment) or a physical experiment (e.g. determining the 3D structure of a protein or determining whether there is oil at a particular location). The cost associated with the labeling process thus may render large, fully labeled training sets infeasible, whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations, semi-supervised learning can be of great practical value. Semi-supervised learning is also of theoretical interest in machine learning and as a model for human learning. A set of l independently identically distributed examples x_1,dots,x_l in X with corresponding labels y_1,dots,y_l in Y and u unlabeled examples x_{l+1},dots,x_{l+u} in X are processed. Semi-supervised learning combines this information to surpass the classification performance that can be obtained either by discarding the unlabeled data and doing supervised learning or by discarding the labels and doing unsupervised learning. Semi-supervised learning may refer to either transductive learning or inductive learning. The goal of transductive learning is to infer the correct labels for the given unlabeled data x_{l+1},dots,x_{l+u} only. The goal of inductive learning is to infer the correct mapping from X to Y. Intuitively, the learning problem can be seen as an exam and labeled data as sample problems that the teacher solves for the class as an aid in solving another set of problems. In the transductive setting, these unsolved problems act as exam questions. In the inductive setting, they become practice problems of the sort that will make up the exam. It is unnecessary (and, according to Vapnik's principle, imprudent) to perform transductive learning by way of inferring a classification rule over the entire input space; however, in practice, algorithms formally designed for transduction or induction are often used interchangeably. Assumptions  In order to make any use of unlabeled data, some relationship to the underlying distribution of data must exist. Semi-supervised learning algorithms make use of at least one of the following assumptions: =Continuity assumption= Points that are close to each other are more likely to share a label. This is also generally assumed in supervised learning and yields a preference for geometrically simple decision boundaries. In the case of semi-supervised learning, the smoothness assumption additionally yields a preference for decision boundaries in low-density regions, so few points are close to each other but in different classes. =Cluster assumption= The data tend to form discrete clusters, and points in the same cluster are more likely to share a label (although data that shares a label may spread across multiple clusters). This is a special case of the smoothness assumption and gives rise to feature learning with clustering algorithms. =Manifold assumption= The data lie approximately on a manifold of much lower dimension than the input space. In this case learning the manifold using both the labeled and unlabeled data can avoid the curse of dimensionality. Then learning can proceed using distances and densities defined on the manifold. The manifold assumption is practical when high-dimensional data are generated by some process that may be hard to model directly, but which has only a few degrees of freedom. For instance, human voice is controlled by a few vocal folds, and images of various facial expressions are controlled by a few muscles. In these cases distances and smoothness in the natural space of the generating problem, is superior to considering the space of all possible acoustic waves or images, respectively. History The heuristic approach of self-training (also known as self-learning or self-labeling) is historically the oldest approach to semi-supervised learning, with examples of applications starting in the 1960s. The transductive learning framework was formally introduced by Vladimir Vapnik in the 1970s. cited in Interest in inductive learning using generative models also began in the 1970s. A probably approximately correct learning bound for semi-supervised learning of a Gaussian mixture was demonstrated by Ratsaby and Venkatesh in 1995. in . Cited in Semi-supervised learning has recently become more popular and practically relevant due to the variety of problems for which vast quantities of unlabeled data are available‚Äîe.g. text on websites, protein sequences, or images. Methods =Generative models= Generative approaches to statistical learning first seek to estimate p(xy), the distribution of data points belonging to each class. The probability p(yx) that a given point x has label y is then proportional to p(xy)p(y) by Bayes' rule. Semi-supervised learning with generative models can be viewed either as an extension of supervised learning (classification plus information about p(x)) or as an extension of unsupervised learning (clustering plus some labels). Generative models assume that the distributions take some particular form p(xy,theta) parameterized by the vector theta. If these assumptions are incorrect, the unlabeled data may actually decrease the accuracy of the solution relative to what would have been obtained from labeled data alone. In: However, if the assumptions are correct, then the unlabeled data necessarily improves performance. The unlabeled data are distributed according to a mixture of individual-class distributions. In order to learn the mixture distribution from the unlabeled data, it must be identifiable, that is, different parameters must yield different summed distributions. Gaussian mixture distributions are identifiable and commonly used for generative models. The parameterized joint distribution can be written as p(x,ytheta)=p(ytheta)p(xy,theta) by using the chain rule. Each parameter vector theta is associated with a decision function f_theta(x) = underset{y}{operatorname{argmax}} p(yx,theta). The parameter is then chosen based on fit to both the labeled and unlabeled data, weighted by lambda: :underset{Theta}{operatorname{argmax}}left( log p({x_i,y_i}_{i=1}^l  theta) + lambda log p({x_i}_{i=l+1}^{l+u}theta)right) Zhu, Xiaojin. Semi-Supervised Learning University of Wisconsin-Madison. =Low-density separation= Another major class of methods attempts to place boundaries in regions with few data points (labeled or unlabeled). One of the most commonly used algorithms is the transductive support vector machine, or TSVM (which, despite its name, may be used for inductive learning as well). Whereas support vector machines for supervised learning seek a decision boundary with maximal margin over the labeled data, the goal of TSVM is a labeling of the unlabeled data such that the decision boundary has maximal margin over all of the data. In addition to the standard hinge loss (1-yf(x))_+ for labeled data, a loss function (1-f(x))_+ is introduced over the unlabeled data by letting y=operatorname{sign}{f(x)}. TSVM then selects f^*(x) = h^*(x) + b from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space mathcal{H} by minimizing the regularized empirical risk: :f^* = underset{f}{operatorname{argmin}}left( displaystyle sum_{i=1}^l(1-y_if(x_i))_+ + lambda_1 h_mathcal{H}^2 + lambda_2 sum_{i=l+1}^{l+u} (1-f(x_i))_+ right) An exact solution is intractable due to the non-convex term (1-f(x))_+, so research focuses on useful approximations. Other approaches that implement low-density separation include Gaussian process models, information regularization, and entropy minimization (of which TSVM is a special case). =Graph-based methods= Graph-based methods for semi-supervised learning use a graph representation of the data, with a node for each labeled and unlabeled example. The graph may be constructed using domain knowledge or similarity of examples; two common methods are to connect each data point to its k nearest neighbors or to examples within some distance epsilon. The weight W_{ij} of an edge between x_i and x_j is then set to e^{frac{-x_i-x_j^2}{epsilon}}. Within the framework of manifold regularization,M. Belkin, P. Niyogi, V. Sindhwani. On Manifold Regularization. AISTATS 2005. the graph serves as a proxy for the manifold. A term is added to the standard Tikhonov regularization problem to enforce smoothness of the solution relative to the manifold (in the intrinsic space of the problem) as well as relative to the ambient input space. The minimization problem becomes :underset{finmathcal{H}}{operatorname{argmin}}left( frac{1}{l}displaystylesum_{i=1}^l V(f(x_i),y_i) + lambda_A f^2_mathcal{H} + lambda_I int_mathcal{M} abla_mathcal{M} f(x)^2dp(x) right) where mathcal{H} is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and mathcal{M} is the manifold on which the data lie. The regularization parameters lambda_A and lambda_I control smoothness in the ambient and intrinsic spaces respectively. The graph is used to approximate the intrinsic regularization term. Defining the graph Laplacian L = D - W where D_{ii} = sum_{j=1}^{l+u} W_{ij} and mathbf{f} the vector [f(x_1)dots f(x_{l+u})], we have :mathbf{f}^T L mathbf{f} = displaystylesum_{i,j=1}^{l+u}W_{ij}(f_i- f_j)^2 approx int_mathcal{M} abla_mathcal{M} f(x)^2dp(x). The Laplacian can also be used to extend the supervised learning algorithms: regularized least squares and support vector machines (SVM) to semi-supervised versions Laplacian regularized least squares and Laplacian SVM. =Heuristic approaches= Some methods for semi-supervised learning are not intrinsically geared to learning from both unlabeled and labeled data, but instead make use of unlabeled data within a supervised learning framework. For instance, the labeled and unlabeled examples x_1,dots,x_{l+u} may inform a choice of representation, distance metric, or kernel for the data in an unsupervised first step. Then supervised learning proceeds from only the labeled examples. Self-training is a wrapper method for semi-supervised learning. First a supervised learning algorithm is trained based on the labeled data only. This classifier is then applied to the unlabeled data to generate more labeled examples as input for the supervised learning algorithm. Generally only the labels the classifier is most confident in are added at each step. Co-training is an extension of self-training in which multiple classifiers are trained on different (ideally disjoint) sets of features and generate labeled examples for one another. In human cognition Human responses to formal semi- supervised learning problems have yielded varying conclusions about the degree of influence of the unlabeled data. More natural learning problems may also be viewed as instances of semi-supervised learning. Much of human concept learning involves a small amount of direct instruction (e.g. parental labeling of objects during childhood) combined with large amounts of unlabeled experience (e.g. observation of objects without naming or counting them, or at least without feedback). Human infants are sensitive to the structure of unlabeled natural categories such as images of dogs and cats or male and female faces. Infants and children take into account not only unlabeled examples, but the sampling process from which labeled examples arise.

Campbell Folk School, also referred to as \\"The Folk School\\" is located in Brasstown, North Carolina, along the Cherokee County and Clay line. The school was founded to nurture and preserve the folk arts of the Appalachian Mountains. It is a non-profit adult educational organization based on non-competitive learning. Founded in 1925, the Folk School's motto is \\"I sing behind the plow\\". It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district in 1983. The district encompasses 19 contributing buildings. Notable buildings include the Farm House (pre-1925), Keith House (1926-1928), Log House Museum (19th century, 1926), Mill House (1928), (Former) Milking Barn (now Clay Spencer Blacksmith Shop, c. 1930), Hay Barn (1931), Tower House (1933), Rock House (c. 1932), and Hill House (c. 1932). The Folk School has week-long and weekend classes year-round in traditional and contemporary arts, including blacksmithing, music, dance, cooking, gardening, nature studies, photography, storytelling and writing. The school campus includes a history museum, craft shop, nature trails, lodging, campground, and cafeteria. The school also holds a regular concert series and community dances. The Folk School engages the community through a variety of dance teams including: Magic Rapper, StiX in the Mud Border Morris, Dame's Rocket Northwest Clog, Rural Felicity Garland, and the JCCFS Cloggers. History of the Folk School After spending eighteen months traveling between Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, visiting local schools along the way, Olive Dame Campbell and her colleague Marguerite Butler, began forming the John C. Campbell Folk School in 1925 in Brasstown, North Carolina. This folk high school or folkeh√∏jskole, was dedicated to her late husband, John C. Campbell and was based on the Danish Folk School style of non competitive education, where no grades were given. Instead, students and teachers formed a community that worked together to help each other advance in various crafts such as blacksmithing. John C. Campbell, (1867‚Äì1919) was an American educator and reformer noted for his survey of social conditions in the southern Appalachia. He was born in Indiana and raised in Wisconsin; he studied education and theology in New England. At the turn of the century, the Southern Appalachian region of the United States was viewed as being in need of educational and social missions. Recently married to Olive Dame of Massachusetts, John undertook a fact-finding survey of social conditions in the mountains in 1908-1909. The Campbells outfitted a wagon as a traveling home and studied mountain life from Georgia to West Virginia. While John interviewed farmers about their agricultural practices, Olive collected Appalachian ballads and studied the handicrafts of the mountain people. Both were hopeful that the quality of life could be improved by education, and in turn, wanted to preserve and share with the rest of the world the crafts, techniques and tools that the people of the area used in everyday life. The Folkeh√∏jskole (folk high school) had long been a force in the rural life of Denmark. These schools for life helped transform the Danish countryside into a vibrant, creative force. The Campbells talked of establishing such a school in the rural southern United States as an alternative to the higher-education facilities that drew young people away from the family farm. Several locations were under consideration for the experimental school. On an exploratory trip, Miss Butler discussed the idea with Fred O. Scroggs, Brasstown's local storekeeper, saying that she would be back in a few weeks to determine if area residents had any interest in the idea. When she returned, it was to a meeting of over 200 people at the local church. The people of far west North Carolina enthusiastically pledged labor, building materials and other support.

In other words, it is shown within algorithmic information theory that computational incompressibility \\"mimics\\" (except for a constant that only depends on the chosen universal programming language) the relations or inequalities found in information theory. According to Gregory Chaitin, it is \\"the result of putting Shannon's information theory and Turing's computability theory into a cocktail shaker and shaking vigorously.\\"Algorithmic Information Theory Algorithmic information theory principally studies measures of irreducible information content of strings (or other data structures). Because most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings, or as the limit of a sequence of strings, it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects, including integers. Indeed, one of the main motivations behind AIT is the very study of the information carried by mathematical objects as in the field of metamathematics, e.g., as shown by the incompleteness results mentioned below. Other main motivations came from: surpassing the limitations of classical information theory for single and fixed objects; formalizing the concept of randomness; and finding a meaningful probabilistic inference without prior knowledge of the probability distribution (e.g., whether it is independent and identically distributed, markovian, or even stationary). In this way, AIT is known to be basically found upon three main mathematical concepts and the relations between them: algorithmic complexity, algorithmic randomness, and algorithmic probability. Besides the formalization of a universal measure for irreducible information content of computably generated objects, some main achievements of AIT were to show that: in fact algorithmic complexity follows (in the self-delimited case) the same inequalities (except for a constantor, for the mutual algorithmic information, informing the algorithmic complexity of the input along with the input itself.) that entropy does, as in classical information theory; randomness is incompressibility; and, within the realm of randomly generated software, the probability of occurrence of any data structure is of the order of the shortest program that generates it when running on a universal machine.  Overview  Algorithmic information theory principally studies complexity measures on strings (or other data structures). Because most mathematical objects can be described in terms of strings, or as the limit of a sequence of strings, it can be used to study a wide variety of mathematical objects, including integers. Informally, from the point of view of algorithmic information theory, the information content of a string is equivalent to the length of the most-compressed possible self-contained representation of that string. A self-contained representation is essentially a program‚Äîin some fixed but otherwise irrelevant universal programming language‚Äîthat, when run, outputs the original string. From this point of view, a 3000-page encyclopedia actually contains less information than 3000 pages of completely random letters, despite the fact that the encyclopedia is much more useful. This is because to reconstruct the entire sequence of random letters, one must know, more or less, what every single letter is. On the other hand, if every vowel were removed from the encyclopedia, someone with reasonable knowledge of the English language could reconstruct it, just as one could likely reconstruct the sentence \\"Ths sntnc hs lw nfrmtn cntnt\\" from the context and consonants present. Unlike classical information theory, algorithmic information theory gives formal, rigorous definitions of a random string and a random infinite sequence that do not depend on physical or philosophical intuitions about nondeterminism or likelihood. (The set of random strings depends on the choice of the universal Turing machine used to define Kolmogorov complexity, but any choice gives identical asymptotic results because the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is invariant up to an additive constant depending only on the choice of universal Turing machine. For this reason the set of random infinite sequences is independent of the choice of universal machine.) Some of the results of algorithmic information theory, such as Chaitin's incompleteness theorem, appear to challenge common mathematical and philosophical intuitions. Most notable among these is the construction of Chaitin's constant Œ©, a real number which expresses the probability that a self-delimiting universal Turing machine will halt when its input is supplied by flips of a fair coin (sometimes thought of as the probability that a random computer program will eventually halt). Although Œ© is easily defined, in any consistent axiomatizable theory one can only compute finitely many digits of Œ©, so it is in some sense unknowable, providing an absolute limit on knowledge that is reminiscent of G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorem. Although the digits of Œ© cannot be determined, many properties of Œ© are known; for example, it is an algorithmically random sequence and thus its binary digits are evenly distributed (in fact it is normal).  History  Algorithmic information theory was founded by Ray Solomonoff,Vitanyi, P. \\"Obituary: Ray Solomonoff, Founding Father of Algorithmic Information Theory\\" who published the basic ideas on which the field is based as part of his invention of algorithmic probability‚Äîa way to overcome serious problems associated with the application of Bayes' rules in statistics. He first described his results at a Conference at Caltech in 1960,Paper from conference on \\"Cerebral Systems and Computers\\", California Institute of Technology, February 8‚Äì11, 1960, cited in \\"A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference, Part 1, 1964, p. 1 and in a report, February 1960, \\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference.\\"Solomonoff, R., \\"A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference\\", Report V-131, Zator Co., Cambridge, Ma., (November Revision of February 4, 1960 report.) Algorithmic information theory was later developed independently by Andrey Kolmogorov, in 1965 and Gregory Chaitin, around 1966. There are several variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information; the most widely used one is based on self-delimiting programs and is mainly due to Leonid Levin (1974). Per Martin- L√∂f also contributed significantly to the information theory of infinite sequences. An axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory based on the Blum axioms (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in a paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov (Burgin 1982). The axiomatic approach encompasses other approaches in the algorithmic information theory. It is possible to treat different measures of algorithmic information as particular cases of axiomatically defined measures of algorithmic information. Instead of proving similar theorems, such as the basic invariance theorem, for each particular measure, it is possible to easily deduce all such results from one corresponding theorem proved in the axiomatic setting. This is a general advantage of the axiomatic approach in mathematics. The axiomatic approach to algorithmic information theory was further developed in the book (Burgin 2005) and applied to software metrics (Burgin and Debnath, 2003; Debnath and Burgin, 2003).  Precise definitions  A binary string is said to be random if the Kolmogorov complexity of the string is at least the length of the string. A simple counting argument shows that some strings of any given length are random, and almost all strings are very close to being random. Since Kolmogorov complexity depends on a fixed choice of universal Turing machine (informally, a fixed \\"description language\\" in which the \\"descriptions\\" are given), the collection of random strings does depend on the choice of fixed universal machine. Nevertheless, the collection of random strings, as a whole, has similar properties regardless of the fixed machine, so one can (and often does) talk about the properties of random strings as a group without having to first specify a universal machine. An infinite binary sequence is said to be random if, for some constant c, for all n, the Kolmogorov complexity of the initial segment of length n of the sequence is at least n ‚àí c. It can be shown that almost every sequence (from the point of view of the standard measure‚Äî\\"fair coin\\" or Lebesgue measure‚Äîon the space of infinite binary sequences) is random. Also, since it can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity relative to two different universal machines differs by at most a constant, the collection of random infinite sequences does not depend on the choice of universal machine (in contrast to finite strings). This definition of randomness is usually called Martin-L√∂f randomness, after Per Martin-L√∂f, to distinguish it from other similar notions of randomness. It is also sometimes called 1-randomness to distinguish it from other stronger notions of randomness (2-randomness, 3-randomness, etc.). In addition to Martin-L√∂f randomness concepts, there are also recursive randomness, Schnorr randomness, and Kurtz randomness etc. Yongge Wang showed that all of these randomness concepts are different. (Related definitions can be made for alphabets other than the set {0,1}.)  Specific sequence  Algorithmic information theory (AIT) is the information theory of individual objects, using computer science, and concerns itself with the relationship between computation, information, and randomness. The information content or complexity of an object can be measured by the length of its shortest description. For instance the string \`\\"0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101\\"\` has the short description \\"32 repetitions of '01'\\", while \`\\"1100100001100001110111101110110011111010010000100101011110010110\\"\` presumably has no simple description other than writing down the string itself. More formally, the Algorithmic Complexity (AC) of a string x is defined as the length of the shortest program that computes or outputs x, where the program is run on some fixed reference universal computer. A closely related notion is the probability that a universal computer outputs some string x when fed with a program chosen at random. This Algorithmic \\"Solomonoff\\" Probability (AP) is key in addressing the old philosophical problem of induction in a formal way. The major drawback of AC and AP are their incomputability. Time-bounded \\"Levin\\" complexity penalizes a slow program by adding the logarithm of its running time to its length. This leads to computable variants of AC and AP, and Universal \\"Levin\\" Search (US) solves all inversion problems in optimal time (apart from some unrealistically large multiplicative constant). AC and AP also allow a formal and rigorous definition of randomness of individual strings to not depend on physical or philosophical intuitions about non-determinism or likelihood. Roughly, a string is Algorithmic \\"Martin-L√∂f\\" Random (AR) if it is incompressible in the sense that its algorithmic complexity is equal to its length. AC, AP, and AR are the core sub-disciplines of AIT, but AIT spawns into many other areas. It serves as the foundation of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, can simplify proofs in computational complexity theory, has been used to define a universal similarity metric between objects, solves the Maxwell daemon problem, and many others.

Under such a law, people have no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, so long as they are in a place where they are lawfully present.Florida Statutes Title XLVI Chapter 776 Stand-your-ground laws cannot be invoked by someone who is the initial aggressor, or who is otherwise engaged in criminal activity. The exact details vary by jurisdiction. The alternative to stand your ground is \\"duty to retreat.\\" In states that implement a duty to retreat, even a person who is unlawfully attacked (or who is defending someone who is unlawfully attacked) may not use deadly force if it is possible to instead avoid the danger with complete safety by retreating. Even duty-to-retreat states generally follow the \\"castle doctrine,\\" under which people have no duty to retreat when they are attacked in their homes, or (in some states) in their vehicles or workplaces. The castle doctrine and \\"stand-your-ground\\" laws provide legal defenses to persons who have been charged with various use of force crimes against persons, such as murder, manslaughter, aggravated assault, and illegal discharge or brandishing of weapons, as well as attempts to commit such crimes. Whether a jurisdiction follows stand-your-ground or duty-to-retreat is just one element of its self-defense laws. Different jurisdictions allow deadly force against different crimes. All American states allow it against threat of death, serious bodily injury, and likely kidnapping or rape; some also allow it against threat of robbery and burglary. A 2018 RAND Corporation review of existing research concluded that \\"there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws may increase homicide rates and limited evidence that the laws increase firearm homicides in particular.\\" In 2019, RAND authors indicated additional evidence had appeared to reinforce their conclusions.Andrew R.

At least 6 states have laws stating that \\"civil remedies are unaffected by criminal provisions of self-defense law\\" (Hawaii, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Tennessee). Controversy Stand-your-ground laws are frequently labeled \\"shoot first\\" laws by opposition groups, including the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. In Florida, self-defense claims tripled in the years following enactment. Opponents argue that Florida's law makes it potentially more difficult to prosecute cases against individuals who commit a crime and claim self-defense. Before passage of the law, Miami police chief John F. Timoney called the law unnecessary and dangerous in that \\"[w]hether it's trick-or-treaters or kids playing in the yard of someone who doesn't want them there or some drunk guy stumbling into the wrong house, you're encouraging people to possibly use deadly physical force where it shouldn't be used.\\" A counter argument is that implementing a duty-to-retreat places the safety of the criminal above a victim's own life. In Florida, a partisan task force created by former Democratic state Sen. Chris Smith of Fort Lauderdale found the law to be \\"confusing\\". Those discussing issues with the group included Buddy Jacobs, a lawyer representing the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association. Jacobs recommended the law's repeal, stating that modifying the law would not fix its problems. In a July 16, 2013 speech in the wake of the jury verdict acquitting George Zimmerman of charges stemming from the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, Attorney General Eric Holder criticized stand-your- ground laws as \\"senselessly expand[ing] the concept of self-defense and sow[ing] dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods.\\" The defendant, George Zimmerman, claimed he was restrained at the time of the shooting, thus allowing no option for retreat and making 'stand your ground' irrelevant to the case. In 2014, Florida's legislature considered a bill that would allow people to show a gun or fire a warning shot during a confrontation without drawing a lengthy prison sentence. In 2017 there was a bill proposed in Florida's state legislature that would require the prosecution to prove that a defendant's use of self-defense was not valid. In 2018, the shooting of Markeis McGlockton led some civil rights activists and politicians to call for abolition of the statute.Fatal shooting reignites 'Stand Your Ground' law debate in Florida, FOX, August 21, 2018  Racial disparity  In 2012, in response to the Trayvon Martin case, the Tampa Bay Times compiled a report on the application of stand your ground, and also created a database of cases where defendants sought to invoke the law. Their report found no racial disparity in Florida cases in which defendants claiming self-defense under the law are prosecuted, with Caucasian subjects being charged and convicted at the same rate as African American subjects, and results of mixed-race cases were similar for both white victims of black attackers and black victims of white attackers. Victims of African American attackers overall were more successful at using the law than victims of Caucasian attackers, regardless of the victim's race claiming self-defense, but analysis showed that black attackers were also more likely to be armed and to be involved in committing a crime, such as burglary, when shot. A Texas A&M; study found that when whites use the stand-your-ground defense against black attackers they are more successful than when blacks use the defense against white attackers. A paper from The Urban Institute which analysed FBI data found that in stand-your-ground states, the use of the defense by whites in the shooting of a black person is found to be justifiable 17 percent of the time, while the defense when used by blacks in the shooting of a white person is successful 1 percent of the time. In non-stand-your-ground states, the shooting of a black person by a white is found justified approximately 9 percent of the time, while the shooting of a white person by a black is found justified approximately 1 percent of the time. According to the Urban Institute, in Stand Your Ground states, white-on- black homicides are 354 percent more likely to be ruled justified than white- on-white homicides, even though they are more common by over 72 percent. The paper's author noted that the data used do not detail the circumstances of the shooting, which could be a source of the disparity. They also noted that the total number of shootings in the FBI dataset of black victims by whites was 25. A 2015 study found that cases with white victims are two times more likely to result in convictions under these laws than cases with black victims.  Effects on crime  A 2018 RAND Corporation review of existing research concluded that \\"there is moderate evidence that stand-your-ground laws may increase homicide rates and limited evidence that the laws increase firearm homicides in particular.\\" In 2019, RAND authors published an update, writing \\"Since publication of RAND's report, at least four additional studies meeting RAND's standards of rigor have reinforced the finding that \\"stand your ground\\" laws increase homicides. None of them found that \\"stand your ground\\" laws deter violent crime. No rigorous study has yet determined whether \\"stand your ground\\" laws promote legitimate acts of self-defense. A 2017 study in the Journal of Human Resources found that Stand Your Ground laws led to an increase in homicides and hospitalizations related to firearm-inflicted injuries. The study estimated that at least 30 people died per month due to the laws. A 2013 study in the Journal of Human Resources found that Stand Your Ground laws in states across the U.S. \\"do not deter burglary, robbery, or aggravated assault. In contrast, they lead to a statistically significant 8 percent net increase in the number of reported murders.\\" A 2016 study in the Social Science Journal found that stand-your-ground laws were not associated with lower crime rates. A 2016 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association compared homicide rates in Florida following the passage of its \\"stand your ground\\" self-defense law to the rates in four control states, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Virginia, which have no similar laws. It found that the law was associated with a 24.4% increase in homicide and a 31.6% increase in firearm-related homicide, but no change in rates of suicide or suicide by firearm, between 2005 and 2014. It noted that, \\"[c]ircumstances unique to Florida may have contributed to our findings, including those that we could not identify,\\" and \\"[o]ur study examined the effect of the Florida law on homicide and homicide by firearm, not on crime and public safety\\". The study was criticized by researcher and gun rights advocate John Lott, for studying only one state and focusing on a narrow definition of effectivness. Studies conducted by Lott‚Äôs Crime Prevention Research Center found that the loosening of restrictions on defensive gun use, including ‚Äústand your ground laws‚Äù, led to a decrease in crime overall. Gun rights activist Andrew Branca was critical of the AMA study for not distinguishing between justifiable homicides and murder, and for relying solely on statutory laws while overlooking case law (i.e. Virginia) in determining the data set. The study's methodology was defended by Duke University professor Jeffrey Swanson for its use of other states as controls, saying \\"[t]hey look at comparable trends in states that didn't pass the law and don't see the effect.\\". In a 2007 National District Attorneys Association symposium, numerous concerns were voiced that the law could increase crime. This included criminals using the law as a defense for their crimes, more people carrying guns, and that people would not feel safe if they felt that anyone could use deadly force in a conflict. The report also noted that the misinterpretation of clues could result in use of deadly force when there was, in fact, no danger. The report specifically notes that racial and ethnic minorities could be at greater risk because of negative stereotypes. A 2012 study examined whether a prominent Stand Your Ground shooting, Joe Horn shooting controversy, in 2007, which brought public attention to Texas' stand-your-ground law impacted crime. The study found that subsequent to the shooting, burglaries decreased significantly in Houston, but not in Dallas, over a 20-month period. A 2015 study found that the adoption of Oklahoma's stand-your-ground law was associated with a decrease in residential burglaries, but also that the law had \\"the unintended consequence of increasing the number of non-residential burglaries.\\" Florida's stand-your- ground law went into effect on October 1, 2005. Florida state representative Dennis Baxley, an author of the law, said that the violent crime rate has dropped since the enactment of the law, though he said there may be many reasons for the change. Others have argued that the law may lead to an increase in crime. Violent crime data for 1995 ‚Äì 2015 has been published by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. =Canada= In Canada, there is no duty to retreat under the law. Canada's laws regarding self-defence are similar in nature to those of England, as they centre around the acts committed, and whether or not those acts are considered reasonable in the circumstances. The sections of the Canadian criminal code that deal with self- defence or defence of property are sections 34 and 35, respectively. These sections were updated in 2012 to clarify the code, and to help legal professionals apply the law in accordance with the values Canadians hold to be acceptable. =Czech Republic= There is no explicit stand-your-ground or castle doctrine provision in the laws of the Czech Republic; however, there is also no duty to retreat from an attack. In order for a defense to be judged as legitimate, it may not be \\"manifestly disproportionate to the manner of the attack\\". =England and Wales= The common law jurisdiction of England and Wales has a stand-your-ground law rooted in the common law defence of using reasonable force in self-defence. In English common law there is no duty to retreat before a person may use reasonable force against an attacker, nor need a person wait to be attacked before using such force, but one who chooses not to retreat, when retreat would be a safe and easy option, might find it harder to justify his use of force as 'reasonable'. Any force used must be reasonable in the circumstances as the person honestly perceived them to be, after making allowance for the fact that some degree of excess force might still be reasonable in the heat of the moment. In the home, the householder is protected by an additional piece of legislation in which is specified that force used against an intruder is not to be regarded as reasonable if it is 'grossly disproportionate' (as distinct from merely 'disproportionate' force, which can still be reasonable). =Germany= German law permits self-defense against an unlawful attack. If there is no other possibility for defense, it is generally allowed to use even deadly force without a duty to retreat. However, there must not be an extreme imbalance (\\"extremes Missverh√§ltnis\\") between the defended right and the chosen method of defense. In particular, in case firearms are used, a warning shot must be given when defending a solely material asset. If the self-defense was excessive, its perpetrator is not to be punished if they exceeded on account of confusion, fear or terror. = Ireland = Under the terms of the Defence and the Dwelling Act, property owners or residents are entitled to defend themselves with force, up to and including lethal force. Any individual who uses force against a trespasser is not guilty of an offense if he or she honestly believes they were there to commit a criminal act and a threat to life. However, there is a further provision which requires that the reaction to the intruder is such that another reasonable person in the same circumstances would likely employ it. This provision acts as a safeguard against grossly disproportionate use of force, while still allowing a person to use force in nearly all circumstances. The law was introduced in response to DPP v. Padraig Nally. A person who uses such force as is permitted by section 2 in the circumstances referred to in that section shall not be liable in tort with respect to any injury, loss or damage arising from the use of such force. The force used is only such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he or she believes them to be‚Äî (i) to protect himself or herself or another person present in the dwelling from injury, assault, detention or death caused by a criminal act, (ii) to protect his or her property or the property of another person from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act, or (iii) to prevent the commission of a crime or to effect, or assist in effecting, a lawful arrest. It does not matter whether the person using the force had a safe and practicable opportunity to retreat from the dwelling before using the force concerned. This law does not apply to force used against a member of An Garda Sioch√°na (Irish Police) or anyone assisting them, or a person lawfully performing a function authorised by or under any enactment. = Poland = Stand your ground law applies to any kind of threat by an attacker that endangers the victim's safety, health, or life. The victim has no obligation to retreat, as said in a statement by the Supreme Court of Poland on February 4, 1972: \\"The assaulted person is under no obligation either to escape or hide from the assailant in a locked room, nor to endure the assault restricting his freedom, but has the right to repel the assault with all available means that are necessary to force the assailant to refrain from continuing his assault.\\" In practice, according to the judgments of the Polish courts, the right to self-defense is very rarely used, and if being used is the basis for applying criminal charges. For these reasons, self-defense is very rarely used as a basis for acquittal in Polish courts.

M. Dent & Sons Joseph Malaby Dent (30 August 1849 - 9 May 1926) was a British book publisher who produced the Everyman's Library series. Early life Dent was born in Darlington in what is now part of the Grade II listed Britannia Inn. After a short and unsuccessful stint as an apprentice printer he took up bookbinding. At the age of fifteen he gave a talk on James Boswell's Life of Johnson which would be the first book printed in the Everyman's Library. Around 1896 he began publishing high-quality limited editions of literary classics in the Temple Classics series. Career In 1888 he founded the publishing firm of J. M. Dent and Company (it became J.M. Dent & Sons in 1909). Between 1889 and 1894 Dent published the works of Charles Lamb, Oliver Goldsmith, Jane Austen, Chaucer, Tennyson, and like authors. Printed in small runs on handmade paper, these early editions enjoyed modest commercial success. Dent established the highly successful Temple Shakespeare series in 1894.The Temple Shakespeare (J. M. Dent) - Book Series List, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 30 March 2017. In 1904, Dent began to plan Everyman's Library, a series of one thousand classics to be published in an attractive format and sold at one shilling. To meet demand, Dent built the Temple Press in Letchworth recently founded as the first Garden City. The publication of the Everyman Library began in 1906 and 152 titles were issued by the end of the first year. However, it was soon confronted by a double blow: the Copyright Act 1911 which extended protection to fifty years after the author's death thus reducing the availability of Victorian texts, and World War I which brought with it inflation and shortages of supplies. In A Sinking Island, Hugh Kenner wrote: \\"Destiny beckoned J. M. Dent toward the kingdom of books, and without ever learning to spell he became an influential bookman. He was small, lame, tight-fisted, and apt to weep under pressure, a performance that could disconcert authors and employees. When his temper had risen like a flame he'd scream; the scream, one employee recalled, was what broke men's spirits. His paroxysms were famous; a Swedish specialist thought of prescribing a pail of cold water for Dent to plunge his head into. For editing the Library he paid Ernest Rhys three guineas a volume --what senior office-boys might earn in two weeks. Dent's ungovernable passion was for bringing Books to the People. He remembered when he'd longed to buy books he couldn't afford. Yes, you could make the world better. He even thought cheap books might prevent wars.\\"New York Times Book Review, February 28, 1988. Although not a new idea, what set Everyman's apart from earlier series was its scope; Dent planned for no less than one thousand volumes. He was able to build a new factory and offices in Covent Garden with the profits. Despite having an impressive range of literature, Dent prevented classics of dubious morals, such as Moll Flanders, from being printed. The First World War slowed the production of books and Dent did not live to see the one thousand volume mark reached in 1956. Among the impressive volumes that came from Dent was The Pilgrim's Regress, the spiritual autobiography of C. S. Lewis, published in 1933. Later years J. M. Dent, his sons Hugh and Jack, and Jack's son F. J. Martin Dent, constituted the board of directors in the 1920s. Hugh Dent joined the firm in 1909 and functioned as an editor for Everyman's Library; Jack joined the firm in 1915 and supervised the Temple Press; F. J. Martin Dent came in 1924 and directed the production department. After J. M. Dent's death, W. G. Taylor, the secretary of the firm since 1916, joined the board. Hugh R. Dent served as the chairman from 1926 to 1938, followed by Taylor from 1938 to 1963. Taylor was also managing director from 1934 to 1955. F. J. Martin Dent followed Taylor as managing director and chairman. Weidenfeld & Nicolson purchased J. M. Dent & Sons in January 1988.J. M. Dent and Sons (Library of the University of North Carolina) It now forms an imprint of the Orion Publishing Group. The registered companies of J. M. Dent & Sons and Everyman's Library were retained by the Dent family and are now, respectively, an investment company, Malaby Holdings Ltd, and Malaby Martin Ltd, a niche development company. A new sister company Malaby Biogas Ltd was created in 2009 as a pioneering renewable energy and sustainable development business. References Further reading * J. M. and Hugh R.

Background and inspiration The song is written and performed in style reminiscent to the work of musician Bo Diddley, staying mostly on a single chord (A Major), while strumming barre chords (from B Major to E Major) down the guitar neck for the intro, outro, and breaks, and from B minor to D minor for the bridge. The lyrics are impressions of sights and sounds on a Monkees tour, while \\"Hamilton's smiling down\\" refers to a Hamilton music stand, used for rehearsals and recording. Release While the movie included the song performed live by the Monkees in Salt Lake City, Utah on May 17, 1968, during a free show at the Valley Auditorium, the original soundtrack album instead substituted a studio recording, made by Nesmith and session musicians (an unexplained decision that became a major source of tension in the group). The film version intercut Vietnam War footage with concert footage, and featured several mirrored shots of the band onstage. A lo-fi transcription of the concert version was included on an Australian Monkees compilation in the early 1980s, Monkeemania (40 Timeless Hits), while an alternate studio take appeared on a Rhino Records album, Monkee Flips, in 1984.

His work in establishing complexity classes has helped to create the background against which non-deterministic and probabilistic reasoning can be performed. He has also done extensive work in the field of natural language processing and mathematical linguistics. He has been focused on computational complexity as it applies to genetics and biology for over 10 years. Aside from his work in theoretical computer science, Savitch has written a number of textbooks for learning to program in C/C++, Java, Ada, Pascal and others. Savitch received his PhD in mathematics from University of California, Berkeley in 1969 under the supervision of Stephen Cook.

This 16mm film camera was a popular camera used by amateur filmmakers. Sony Mavica FD 5. Amateur film is the low-budget hobbyist art of film practised for passion and enjoyment and not for business purposes. Organizations The international organization for amateur film makers is UNICA (Union International du Cinema Non Professionel); in the United States the American Motion Picture Society (AMPS), in Canada the Society of Canadian Cine Amateurs (SCCA), in the UK it is the Institute of Amateur Cinematographers. These organizations arrange annual festivals and conventions. There are several amateur film festivals held annually in the United States, Canada and Europe. Creation Amateur films were usually shot on 16 mm film or on 8 mm film (either Double-8 or Super-8) until the advent of cheap video cameras or digital equipment. The advent of digital video and computer based editing programs greatly expanded the technical quality achievable by the amateur and low-budget filmmaker. Amateur video has become the choice for the low-budget filmmaker and has boomed into a very watched and even produced industry with the use of VHS and digital video camcorders.  Notable films  A number of amateur films have been added to the National Film Preservation Board's (NFPB) National Film Registry (NFR) including: * The Augustas (1930s-1950s) * Tacoma Narrows Bridge Collapse (1940) * Disneyland Dream (1956) * Zapruder film (1963)  External links  * Amateur Film Clips * Streaming Amateur Film * Amateur Cinema Project  Further reading  * Ian Craven (ed.)

Murray was the longest serving newspaper editor in Australia when he resigned in February 2000. Biography =Early life= Murray was born in Mount Lawley in 1950, and grew up in the eastern Perth suburb of Guildford in the Swan Valley. His father, Keith Murray, was a journalist at The West Australian for a decade from 1948 and his older brother Kim was a reporter at the Daily News. He attended Guildford Primary School and then Guildford Grammar School. He initially studied geology at the University of Western Australia, then worked as a mine geologist in Kalgoorlie before changing career. =Career= He took a cadetship at The West Australian in 1970 and through the 1970s worked variously from its Fremantle, Kalgoorlie, Perth, Sydney and Melbourne offices. He worked at the Western Mail from 1981, before returning to The West Australian as chief of staff in 1987. In March 1990 he was appointed editor of the newspaper where he began his career in 1970. He quit The West ten years later to become a morning talk-back announcer on Perth commercial radio station, 6PR, before leaving in 2006 over a contract-renewal disagreement (he rejoined in 2011). In 2006 he returned to The West Australian as a columnist and feature writer. During his tenure as editor of The West Australian he took the circulation of the newspaper to over 400,000 for the first time (1997) and, in 1998, to over one million readers for the newspaper's Saturday edition. He introduced \\"Asia Desk\\", which involved the assignment of a journalist to cover events mainly in Southeast Asia. Murray won WA's top journalism award, the University of Western Australia's Lovekin Prize in 1985, and the Daily News Centenary Prize in 1986, as well as the Beck Prize for political journalism in 1986.

The community is part of the Terre Haute Metropolitan Statistical Area. A large portion of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods along U.S. Route 150 is taken up by the grounds of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of- the-Woods, which contain the motherhouse of the Sisters of Providence as well as Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. Although Saint Mary-of-the-Woods is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 47876.Zip Code Lookup It had a population of 797 at the 2010 census. History The earliest land records in Saint Mary-of-the-Woods date back to 1825, when George and Polly Smith acquired a land patent signed by Andrew Jackson. It is likely that this was a land grant for military service, as George Smith served as an aide and dispatch bearer to George Washington during the American Revolution. In the following years several other settlers acquired acreage from the United States government. From the Smiths, a Joseph Thralls and his family acquired a significant parcel of land in 1835. Records from 1838 show a purchase of land transferring from Joseph and Sarah Thralls to Bishop Simon Brut√© of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Vincennes for a sum of fifteen dollars. Brut√© was concerned with establishing a Catholic mission for the surrounding Terre Haute area and built a small frame church, the first in Vigo County. In 1840, Saint Mother Theodore Guerin arrived in Saint Mary-of-the-Woods with several companions and found a dense forest with few buildings. There she established the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, a Roman Catholic congregation of women. Originally, the Thralls family provided housing for the sisters. As the Sisters of Providence grew in number, the town of St. Mary's also expanded. In April 1850, twenty men from the village had left for California in search of gold. Despite this, by 1851, Sister of Providence Sister Saint Francis Xavier wrote, \\"Now we have quite a little country town... We have in the village a post office, two little inns, three or four stores, wheelwrights, coopers, carpenters, blacksmiths, shoemakers, cabinet makers, etc.\\" A post office was established under the name St. Mary's in 1846. It was renamed to Saint Mary Of The Woods in 1912, and is still currently in operation.

The canton lies west of the San Jos√© Canton and its whole territory is part of the Greater Metropolitan Area. The canton was one of the earliest established in the country, in 7 December 1848. As the metropolitan area has expanded Escaz√∫ has become a suburban area on the west side of the national capital city of San Jos√©. It is delineated by the R√≠o Tirib√≠ on its northern border. The peak of Cerro Cedral in the Cerros de Escaz√∫ marks the southern limit of the canton.  Geography  Escaz√∫ has an area of km¬≤ and a mean elevation of metres. Districts The canton of Escaz√∫ is subdivided into three districts (distritos): * Escaz√∫ * San Antonio * San Rafael Toponymy The name \\"Escaz√∫\\" derives from the indigenous word \\"Izt-kat-zu\\", which means \\"resting stone\\". The story tells of Indians traveling from Aserri (south of San Jose) to Pacaca (near Ciudad Colon), who used to stop and rest at this location, which was about halfway between the two villages. History Escaz√∫ was first mentioned as a canton in a decree dated 7 December 1848. The first inhabitants were natives from the Guetaras or Huaca tribes. By 1755, villagers were ordered out of Escaz√∫ and moved to San Jos√© by force. From 1796 to 1799 the church of San Miguel was built with the cooperation of the people that had already re-established at this site. By 1801 the population of Escaz√∫ reached 1,325. On May 28, 1920, the government of Costa Rica granted Escaz√∫ the status of City, head of the Canton (County) of Escaz√∫. Popular legend tags Escaz√∫ as (the City of the Witches), leading to its municipal seal, a depiction of a witch on a broomstick flying over the surrounding mountains. Landmarks Local landmarks in the canton include the Costa Rica Country Club, the Multi Plaza Mall, and more recently, Avenida Escaz√∫. These new complexes hold some of the world's most luxurious brands in Multiplaza Mall. Escaz√∫ is also home to several diplomatic missions, including the residence of the Ambassador from the United States.  Demographics  For the 2011 census, Escaz√∫ had a population of inhabitants. The canton's urban areas are home to 79.8% of its population. Children under the age of 10 account for 17.88% of the population, while 6.05% are over 65. According to a 2012 United Nations Development Programme, Escaz√∫ ranks as the 4th highest canton in Costa Rica in so far as human development.

Named after the Eastern philosopher and scholar al-Farabi, it is one of the country's largest universities. KazNU is the oldest classical university of the Republic established by a Decree of the Kazakh Regional Committee (KRC) office dated November 13, 1933. One year after Kazakhstan's 1990 declaration of independence, the name was changed to Al- Farabi Kazakh State University. According to the QS World University Rankings KazNU takes 207th place in the rating of the best universities of the world. In 2001, the government classified it as a \\"national\\" university. More than 20,000 students, post-graduates and PhD students study at KazNU, and there are more than 2500 faculty members working at KazNU, including 400 doctors of science, professors and more than 800 candidates of science and associate professors.

In 1937, the first Faculty of Humanities ‚Äì the Faculty of Foreign Languages was established; a year later, the Faculty of Philology. In May 1941, as a result of joining with the University of the Kazakh Communist Institute of Journalism, the Faculty of Journalism was established. After the severe years of war, new faculties began to open. In August 1947, the Faculty of Geography was established and, in 1949, the faculties of Philosophy and Economics. As a result of the joining with the Alma-Ata Institute of Law in 1955, the Faculty of Law was established. During the same period, a strong scientific educational and methodological base emerged at the university. By the mid-1980s there were 98 departments, 43 scientific research laboratories and 9 scientific research groups at KazSU. The faculty staff consisted of 1180 people; among the faculty staff there were 30 academicians and AS KazSSR correspondent members, more than 100 doctors, professors, more than 600 science candidates, lecturers.

Favre was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, and later became an advocate in the fight against the disease. Life Deanna was adopted by Kerry Tynes when he married Deanna's mother, Ann. Deanna has a sister, Christie, and a brother, Casey. She met Brett Favre while growing up in Kiln; they had attended school together since early childhood, and began dating in high school during her sophomore and Favre's freshman year. After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended community college in Poplarville on a basketball scholarship, subsequently transferring to the University of Southern Mississippi to finish her degree. At age 20, Deanna became pregnant and gave birth to Favre's daughter, Brittany Nicole, on February 6, 1989. As a single mother, she put herself through college while working various jobs, including working for a collection agency. She graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in December 1994 with a degree in exercise science. She moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin to live with Favre in 1995. Their relationship was strained during this time, which may have been related to Favre's newfound fame as an NFL quarterback and his addiction to Vicodin. Deanna said that Favre often ignored her and Brittany, describing him as \\"loud, rough, and often hateful.\\" Deanna said she considered leaving Favre but worried that his addiction might become worse if she left. Favre, with Deanna at his side, publicly announced his addiction on May 14, 1996. Following his recovery, he credited Deanna as the reason he overcame the addiction. During his recovery, Favre proposed to Deanna. She was uncertain at first, but agreed when he went to get a marriage license and she was told she needed to come in and sign it. Deanna Tynes and Brett Favre were married on July 14, 1996, at St. Agnes Catholic Church in Green Bay. In 1999, the couple became estranged over Brett Favre's drinking problem. After she threatened to permanently leave him, he entered rehab for a second time and reportedly has not consumed alcohol since. Deanna later described her relationship with her husband as stronger than ever. \\"All the stuff we've been through over the years has molded us into two different people. It's awesome to think where we started and where we are now ... [O]ur relationship has gotten to a much stronger point, a deeper love; we have so much respect and love for each other\\", she said in an interview. Deanna and Favre's second daughter, Breleigh Ann, was born on July 13, 1999. On October 6, 2004, Deanna's 24-year-old brother, Casey Tynes, was killed in an all-terrain vehicle accident on the Favres' Mississippi property. In late August 2005, the Favre home in Hattiesburg was damaged by Hurricane Katrina, though no one was injured. The couple housed 50 family members in their home during the storm.  Career  Deanna and Brett Favre, second and third from left, attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony with First Lady Laura Bush in Kiln, Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina.Deanna Favre made headlines in October 2004 after being diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 35. As she underwent treatment, she began receiving letters from women throughout the country about how they had been motivated to get breast examinations after hearing her story. Following a lumpectomy and five months of chemotherapy, she made a complete recovery. In 2005, she began selling pink Green Bay Packers hats to raise money and awareness for breast cancer, which outsold regular Packers hats during the first half of 2005. = The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation = Deanna Favre created the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation, which supports breast cancer education, women's breast imaging and diagnosis services for all women, including those who are medically underserved. The organization focuses on the needs of underinsured and uninsured women. The foundation has raised around $500,000 as of October 2007. Before starting her own foundation, she ran the Brett Favre Fourward Foundation, which has raised more than $3 million for disadvantaged or disabled children in Wisconsin and Mississippi. =Books= *Don't Bet against Me (October 1, 2007; Tyndale House Publishers; ) - Favre's autobiography *The Cure of the Chronic Life: Overcoming the Hopelessness That Holds You Back (co-authored with Shane Stanford)Deanna Favre Says Faith Helped Her Deal With Allegations Involving HusbandDeanna Favre relying on faith References External links The Deanna Favre Hope Foundation * Interview with FOX News Radio * Article Including Interviews with Deanna's Family and Friends: True Grit by Caroline Goyette * Article regarding Brett & Deanna Favre's Roman Catholic Faith 1968 births Living people American adoptees American Roman Catholics American women activists Breast cancer survivors People from Gulfport, Mississippi People from Hattiesburg, Mississippi University of Southern Mississippi alumni Writers from Mississippi People from Kiln, Mississippi Catholics from Mississippi ","title":"Deanna Favre"},{"id":"2829836","text":"Katz or KATZ may refer to: *Katz (surname) *Katz, British Columbia, an uninhabited official placename in Canada **Katz railway station, a Canadian Pacific Railway flag stop *KATZ (AM), a radio station (1600 AM) licensed to St. Louis, Missouri, United States *KATZ-FM, a radio station (100.3 FM) licensed to Bridgeton, Missouri *22981 Katz (1999 VN30), a main-belt asteroid *Katz Editores, an independent Argentine scholarly publisher *Katz syndrome, a rare congenital disorder *Katz Castle, a castle above the town of St. Goarshausen in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany *Katz Group of Companies, a Canadian retail pharmacy network *Joseph M.

The paper provides a regional slant on the day's news, and traditionally provides close reporting on Leeds United and Leeds Rhinos as well as the Yorkshire County Cricket Club team. The newspaper generally takes a liberal/centre left position, unlike The Yorkshire Post, which has a particularly conservative bias. Despite its title that implies the paper is Yorkshire wide it is a Leeds-based paper, still widely circulated in Bradford, Harrogate, Huddersfield and Wakefield as well. The City of Leeds has two further widely circulated local papers, being the Wetherby News and the Wharfedale and Airedale Observer. For many years, the Evening Post produced a separate edition for South Yorkshire printed simultaneously in Doncaster. In 1970 that was converted into the now-closed Doncaster Evening Post. In his 2015 memoir former reporter Revel Barker recalls the 1960s: \\"During the cricket season...the Evening Post would be on the streets at 10.30 a.m. The 'First' would be out about noon, the 'Final' at 2 p.m., the 'One-star final' around 3.30 and the 'Late Night Final' about 4.30. the Post was selling around 250,000 copies a night... nowadays there is only one edition, written and produced the night before and printed in Sheffield, 36 miles away\\" (In 1963) \\"our main competition the Yorkshire Evening News succumbed to economic pressures and folded to merge with the YEP - for a brief time creating a daily circulation close to half a million copies.\\"The Last Pub in Fleet Street Palatino Publishing 2015 From 1926 on, Yorkshire Evening Post sponsored motorcycle trial events on Post Hill, an area near Farnley specifically acquired for this purpose.

He was also a close associate of Emperor He's wife Empress Deng Sui and continued to be dominant after Emperor He's death, during her regency over his son Emperor Shang and Emperor An. He was also the first Eastern Han Dynasty eunuch to be created a marquess. (The only Western Han Dynasty eunuch who was created a marquess was Empress Xu Pingjun's father Xu Guanghan (Ë®±Âª£Êº¢), whose creation was thanks to his relationship with his daughter and his son-in-law Emperor Xuan, not his post as a eunuch.) Zheng was from Nanyang Commandery (roughly modern Nanyang, Henan) -- the same commandery that the Eastern Han imperial clan dominated. He was described to be cautious, agile, and a deep thinker. He first served in the household of Emperor Zhang while he was still the crown prince under his father Emperor Ming. After Emperor Zhang ascended the throne, he was eventually promoted to the post of an imperial attendant (‰∏≠Â∏∏‰æç). During the time of Empress Dowager Dou's regency over Emperor He, Zheng served as the director of imperial gardens (Èâ§Áõæ‰ª§). He was one of the eunuchs who did not endear himself to Empress Dowager Dou's clan. In 92, Emperor He, apparently dissatisfied with his suppression by the Dou clan, plotted a coup d'√©tat with his brother Liu Qing the Prince of Qinghe, and Zheng. They were successful in carrying out the overthrow of the Dous, and as a reward, Emperor He promoted Zheng to the post of the Empress' palace's head of household (Â§ßÈï∑Áßã). Zheng accepted the post but declined most of the monetary rewards that Emperor He gave him, a fact that made Emperor He even more impressed with him. Emperor He often consulted with him on significant affairs of state, and this started a precedent of eunuchs becoming involved in imperial governance. In 102, breaking past precedent, Emperor He created Zheng the Marquess of Chaoxiang. Zheng supported Emperor He's wife Empress Deng through the turmoils of Emperor He's death in 106 and the death of his son and successor Emperor Shang later that year.

It was created by Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os, who also played one of the title characters, \\"El Ch√≥mpiras\\".\\"Chespirito - Personajes - Los Caquitos\\". Chespirito.com. February 3, 2011.  History  = Origins = Originally, Ch√≥mpiras was a pickpocket and cat burglar who worked with an associate named Peterete (Ram√≥n Vald√©s). Their skills in thievery were marginal, but Peterete was ostensibly the more intelligent and skilled of the pair. Together, they were known as Los Caquitos (which is roughly translated as \\"The Little Thieves\\", \\"caquito\\" being a diminutive of \\"caco\\" which is Spanish for \\"thief\\" or \\"hoodlum\\") and appeared on Chespirito's comedy programs in the 1970s, usually preceding an episode of El Chavo del Ocho or El Chapul√≠n Colorado that did not last the full half-hour. By 1973, El Chavo episodes were all a half-hour long and did not need the filler sketches, and shorter Chapul√≠n episodes ceased to use Caquitos sketches, so the characters virtually disappeared. = Debut on Chespirito = In 1980, a new show premiered called Chespirito, which was an-hour-long and employed all of Chespirito's characters in sketches of varying lengths. On Chespirito, El Ch√≥mpiras and Los Caquitos were revived. However, Ram√≥n Vald√©s had left Chespirito's troupe in 1979, so Peterete was forgotten and replaced with Botija (√âdgar Vivar). Since most of the Caquitos sketches performed on the new show were simply remakes of the ones that had appeared years before on the older ones, Botija's character was extremely similar to Peterete's, except physically, since Botija was extremely fat, and Peterete was extremely thin. = Development = The characters weren't very fleshed out originally, but as Chespirito began writing new sketches for the hour-long show, some of which lasted the entire hour, their backstories became more expanded. Botija was single at first, but got married very quickly to a woman called Chimoltrufia (Florinda Meza) who had moplike hair, a chipped tooth and constantly chewed a piece of gum. She was soon established as the conscience of the sketches; often she would earn money doing a respectable job, usually cleaning or babysitting. Many episodes didn't have to do with Ch√≥mpiras's and Botija's incompetent burgling, but instead focused on life in Chimoltrufia and Botija's tiny apartment. A neighbor named Do√±a Nachita (Angelines Fern√°ndez) started appearing frequently and eventually became a regular. Policemen were a regular feature in Caquitos sketches, but by the mid 1980s, Rub√©n Aguirre became the sketch's definitive policeman, the dimwitted Sgt. Refugio. Around this time, there were many sketches that took place at the police station as the characters tried to argue their innocence after being arrested; presiding over these cases was a judge played by Ra√∫l Padilla, who was eventually named Licenciado Morales. By the late 1980s, Chespirito started shifting away from Chavo and Chapul√≠n sketches, as Chespirito and the others were getting older and less believable in those roles. The focus went to Los Caquitos, prompting a major change. Inspired by an episode of El Chavo, in which Chavo is wrongly accused of stealing, Botija and Ch√≥mpiras vow to never steal again and get honest jobs. They and Chimoltrufia eventually settle into jobs at the inexpensive Hotel Lucho, run by Don Lucho (Carlos Pouliot). Chimoltrufia was a chambermaid and always did her job to the best of her ability, but Botija and Ch√≥mpiras tried to get by doing as little work as possible. = Final years = As the years passed, Chimoltrufia became more and more prominent until she was as much of the focus of the sketch as Ch√≥mpiras, possibly more. (To call it a \\"sketch\\" is not really fair at this point; by 1992, almost all Chespirito episodes were hour- long Ch√≥mpiras \\"sketches\\".) A few changes came at that time. First, Angelines Fern√°ndez stopped appearing (presumably due to her declining health and subsequent death in 1994 from lung cancer) and was gradually replaced by Chimoltrufia's mother Espotaverderona (Anabel Guti√©rrez), who looked like a plump, middle-aged version of Chimoltrufia. Also, one hotel guest began appearing regularly, her name was Maruja (Mar√≠a Antonieta de las Nieves) and she attracted the attention of a lot of men, especially Sgt. Refugio. Then, Don Lucho closed his hotel, and the trio had to look for other jobs. For several episodes they tried other lines of work, but in 1993 a new hotel opened, run by Don Cecilio (Mois√©s Su√°rez) and they got their old jobs back. Cecilio's hotel, Hotel Buenavista, was nicer than Don Lucho's, but the routine was just the same and some of the storylines from the early Lucho episodes were recycled. In 1994 and 1995, Chespirito started returning to its old format of presenting several different sketches during the show, but most featured a long Ch√≥mpiras sketch. In 1995, Chespirito decided to bring the whole thing to a close and stopped producing episodes. For a short time, √âdgar Vivar left the show due to health problems stemming from his weight. To explain Vivar's absence, it was written into the show that Botija was away at a weight-loss clinic, which was also the actor's real-life health situation. Vivar would return some time later, having lost a noticeable amount of weight.  Characters  = Regular characters = *El Ch√≥mpiras (1970-1995) (Roberto G√≥mez Bola√±os) is the title character. Previously he was an \\"amateur\\" thief as he recalls, along with Peterete and later Botija. Both he and el Botija stopped being thieves after viewing an episode of El Chavo del Ocho where el Chavo was falsely accused of being a thief and ran away. The episode so touched their conscience that they gave up their criminal lives to become honorable men. Ch√≥mpiras' full name is Aqu√≠les Esquivel Madrazo, and was only mentioned once in passing. While more dim-witted than Botija, Chompiras proved himself to be somewhat more responsible than him, as he constantly works during their days off, while the lazy Botija only rests during those days. Additionally, Chompiras is implied to be somewhat worried about his economic status, evidently due to the low salary he gets from his work, due to him always working only if somebody gives him a tip, working during his days off, and even doing another job while working at the Hotel Luch/Buenavista, the latter which irritates the hotel's admnistrator. In interviews, Bola√±os said that out of all of his characters, he enjoyed playing el Ch√≥mpiras the most. *El Peterete (1970-1975) (Ram√≥n Vald√©s): El Ch√≥mpiras' original partner in crime. After Vivar's Botija character took his place, no mention was made of what happened to El Peterete. It is believed that this was due to Vald√©s no longer being involved with the Chespirito program, whether due to failing health or his decision to appear on Ah, Qu√© Kiko! with Carlos Villagr√°n. However, Chompiras' bio in the Chespirito website states that El Peterete left Chompiras for the latter's stupidity, and went to another city *Gordon Botija (also known as El Botija) (1979-1995) (√âdgar Vivar) is the second regular from 1979 to 1995. He is \\"large\\", and was also a thief along with Ch√≥mpiras. According to Chompiras' bio in the Chespirito website, Botija met Chompiras shortly after the latter was abandoned by El Peterete. Botija married Chimoltrufia, and later worked in the Hotel Buenavista. Over the length of Vivar's tenure as Botija, the character's last name has changed. In one of the earliest sketches, he claimed that his first name was \\"Boti\\" and his last name was \\"Ja\\". In other sketches, he claims his full name is \\"Gordon Botija y Aguado\\", and in others, \\"Gordon Botija Pompa y Pompa\\", both names being puns on Vivar's rotund figure. In Botija's bio in the Chespirito website, it was explained that his full name is \\"Gordon Botija Aguado Pompa y Pompa\\". The character also claims that his father was English, and that he was also a fan of Flash Gordon, hence his first name of \\"Gordon\\". In spite of costantly mistreating Chompiras, he admitted to love him like a brother when he assumed him to be in critical condition in \\"El Chompiras es mordido por Dracula\\" (1994). Following Vivar's gastric bypass surgery, he retired the character of Botija. *La Chimoltrufia (1980-1995) (Florinda Meza), born Mar√≠a Expropiaci√≥n Petronila Lascur√°in y Torquemada de Botija, is the wife of Botija. She has broom-like hair and works as a hotel maid. She has an extremely roundabout manner of expressing herself, a strong sense of justice, and a singing voice that could curdle milk. She is also quick to resort to physical violence against others who she thinks are doing her wrong. In some episodes, it is shown that she believes movies on TV are real, with her assuming Chompiras to be one of the main creatures of a movie (such as a vampire, an alien, etc.) In spite of being simple-minded and naive, Chimoltrufia often showed an occasional cleverness, most notably in \\"Las Piezas de Pan\\" (1993), where she managed to escape from mobster El Cuajinais' lair by tricking a drunk doctor into freeing her and later injecting the doctor with an anesthetic he was going to use on her. According to her, she was named \\"Mar√≠a Expropiaci√≥n Petronila\\" because she was born the day of the Mexican oil expropriation (in spanish, \\"Dia de la expropiacion petrolera\\"), so she was given that name in honor of the event. Chimoltrufia is shown to be very sensile about her age, constantly refusing to reveal in what year she was born. However, it is implied in La Llegada de Maruja - Parte 2 that she is at least 32-years-old, as she commented to Do√±a Nachita that she left school 12 years before the events of the episode, to which Do√±a Nachita, recalling that she was in school until 3rd grade of primary school, asks if she was in primary school until she was in her 20s. *Sargento Refugio Pasguato (1970-1995)(Ruben Aguirre/Horacio G√≥mez/Carlos Villagr√°n): Dutiful but dumb, Sargento Refugio is one of the only police characters seen working in Licenciado Morales' office. Over the years, he has become friends with Botija, Ch√≥mpiras and La Chimoltrufia. Even so, his overzealousness causes them to end up in front of Licenciado Morales. Whenever he comes to a fairly obvious conclusion, he asks Morales \\"¬øMerezco un acenso?\\" (Do I deserve a raise?). He also often goes along with Chimoltrufia's assumptions of TV movies being real. He previously was a police captain, but was demoted to a grade minor to Sargent after el Licenciado told him to \\"arrest everyone with a criminal face\\", to which he arrested Licenciado. However, he managed to be promoted back to Sargent after arresting a dangerous criminal known as \\"El Gorilla\\", who tried to kill him after being released. *Licenciado Morales (1980-1995) (Ra√∫l \\"Chato\\" \\"Padilla/Rub√©n Aguirre/Ram√≥n Vald√©s): Sgt. Refugio's commanding officer. Also good friends with el Botija, el Ch√≥mpiras and la Chimoltrufia. At the end of almost every episode, all three of them will end up in his office, having been brought in by Sargento Refugio for some controversy. = Other characters = *Do√±a Espotaverderona (1989-1995)(Anabel Guti√©rrez): La Chimoltrufia's mother. She has the same mannerisms as her daughter. She and Botija can't stand each other, especially because every time she stays in their apartment, he is relegated to the couch while she takes his bed. She also shares the same hot temper as her daughter; in one episode, Sargento Refugio attempts to help her cross the street‚Äîand is beaten quite soundly. mistaking his intentions. *Don Cecilio (1993-1995)(Mois√©s Su√°rez): Owner of Hotel Buenavista, the hotel where Ch√≥mpiras, Botija and la Chimoltrufia work. Wears extremely thick glasses. *Don Lucho (1987-1992)(Carlos Pouliot): The owner of Hotel Don Lucho, where Ch√≥mpiras, Botija and la Chimoltrufia originally worked. When Pouliot elected to leave the show, his absence was explained by saying that Hotel Don Lucho needed extensive repairment due to leaks, so the trio was forced to seek jobs elsewhere. *Do√±a Nachita (1983-1993)(Angelines Fern√°ndez): La Chimoltrufia's next-door neighbor and the apartment building's gossip. She does not always get along with Botija, but is infatuated with Ch√≥mpiras. She believes in supernatural, with Nachita supporting and cementing Chimoltrufia's beliefs on supernatural. *Marujita (1989-1994)(Mar√≠a Antonieta de las Nieves): Sgt. Refugio's girlfriend, and an occasional guest at Don Cecilio's hotel‚Äîwhere she occasionally tries to get out of paying the bill. Although she mentions that she travels a lot for her job, her occupation was never revealed during the show's run. She and la Chimoltrufia very rarely get along, and it was hinted that Marujita was a woman of somewhat flexible morals. She is occasionally referred to disparagingly as la tal Maruja (that Maruja girl). *Do√±a Ramona Pompa y Pompa (1991-1994)(√âdgar Vivar): Botija's mother. She was presented as a somewhat snobbish woman. Both she and El Botija are allergic to the smell of gardenias, and have been known to pass out.  Running gags  *The comb: If Ch√≥mpiras angered Botija (or Peterete), the latter would take out a comb and painstakingly straighten Ch√≥mpiras's hair before giving him a hard slap on the face that sent him spinning (and disarrayed his hair). Botija's slap is so powerful that after Ch√≥mpiras spins, he staggers so violently that Botija has to hold him still to stop him before he can give the warning. His slap was even painful to Botija's hand. However, this was never the case with Peterete, as his slap only made Chompiras spin a little bit with ease. Ironically, there had been rare occasions where Botija himself was punished by Chimoltrufia in the very same way Botija punishes Chompiras. *The warning after the comb: After the classic comb slap, Peterete/Botija always warned Ch√≥mpiras (always starting with their catchphrase \\"y la pr√≥xima vez...\\": \\"And next time...\\") that the next time he screwed up or ticked them off again, providing a gruesome yet comical description on what they would do to him. *Chimoltrufia's speech patterns: Chimoltrufia had a large number of nonsensical catchphrases, usually involving malapropisms, redundancies, or just plain weird speech. One of her best known catchphrases is \\"¬øPa' qu√© le digo que no si s√≠?\\" (\\"Why would I tell you that it doesn't if it does?\\") *Chimoltrufia sings: While working or at home, Chimoltrufia starts to sing. However, she has a terrible singing voice, with many characters often telling her to not to scream. However, Chimoltrufia, believing that she is a great singer, says that she isn't screaming but singing, and either is told to not to \\"sing\\" or keeps singing. *The elevator: Working at the hotel, Botija usually read a book or slept inside the elevator he supposedly operated. When a customer wanted to use it, he told them to use the stairs. If they demanded an explanation, he replied that the elevator couldn't carry both his weight and the customer's. When the customer suggested that Botija step out and allow him to use the elevator, Botija refused, insisting that only he could operate the elevator. The end result was that the customer almost always ended up using the stairs‚Äîand lodging a complaint with Don Lucho or Don Cecilio. In one episode, the floor of the elevator gave way, and Botija was stuck, and in the episode \\"El cortocircuito\\" both Chompiras and Botija entered the partly-lifted elevator, causing it to fall and leaving half of it below the ground, proving Botija's claims to be true. *The tip: When working as a bellhop, Ch√≥mpiras would ask if he was going to receive a tip before he even carried any luggage, which angered Don Cecilio or Don Lucho. Oftentimes, he would refuse to carry a customer's luggage if they refused to tip him, which angered the management even more. *Insults: Any time Ch√≥mpiras was insulted by someone (usually Botija) calling him an idiot or animal he would reply \\"¬øQue soy QU√â?\\" (in english: \\"I'm WHAT?\\"), then the other character would repeat the insult in a louder voice, to which Ch√≥mpiras would take a completely relaxed attitude while saying \\"Ah, s√≠, s√≠\\" (in english: \\"Oh, yeah, yeah\\"). *The police station: Ch√≥mpiras, Botija and la Chimoltrufia would almost always end up in some sort of dispute that would involve Licenciado Morales (Ra√∫l \\"Chato\\" Padilla). He would have to shout three times for them all to be quiet, and after the third time they would stop talking‚Äîall except for Ch√≥mpiras, who almost always would have the last word. *Licenciado's nicknames: Throughout the series, a character (usually Chimoltrufia) ends up calling Licenciado an offensive nickname related to dogs, such as \\"Cara de Perro\\" (in english: \\"Dogface\\"), irritating Licenciado. *The lady who runs the drugstore around the corner: Ch√≥mpiras' on-and-off lady friend. She occasionally allows him to sleep in the trastienda (back room) of the drugstore, but occasionally a wandering eye on Ch√≥mpiras' part gets him thrown out. Although she was an occasional plot point, she was never seen onscreen during the show's run. *Sargento Refugio disguises himself: On a few occasions, there were criminal activities in the Hotel Lucho (or Hotel Buenavista) done covertly, forcing Sargento Refugio to infiltrate the hotel in order to prevent the crime by disguising himself with a fake moustache and a trenchcoat. However, his disguise is so poorly done that all the employees in the hotel recognize him instantly, much to the Sargento's annoyance.

Germans with the last name Katz may originate in the Rhine River region of Germany, where the Katz Castle is located. (The name of the castle does not derive from , \\"cat\\", but from Katzenelnbogen, going back to Latin , consisting of the ancient Germanic tribal names of the Chatti and Melibokus.) Where it is a Jewish surname, Katz is an abbreviation () formed from the initials of the term (\\"priest of justice\\"/\\"authentic priest\\") or (meaning the name-bearer is of patrilineal descent of the Kohanim sons of Zadok). It has been used since the seventeenth century, or perhaps somewhat earlier, as an epithet of the descendants of Aaron. The collocation is most likely derived from Melchizedek (\\"king of righteousness\\"), who is called \\"the priest (kohen) of the most high God\\" (Genesis xiv. 18), or perhaps from Psalm cxxxii. 9: \\"Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness (tzedeq)\\". The use of the abbreviated and Germanicized Katz likely coincided with the imposition of German names on Jews in Germany in the 18th or 19th centuries. If the reading is correct, this abbreviation occurs on a tombstone, dated 1536, in the cemetery of Prague.Hock, Die Familien Prag's, p. 175. It is found also on a tombstone of the year 1618 in Frankfurt,M. Horowitz (Moses Horowitz?), Die Inschriften des Alten Friedhofes der Israelitischen Gemeinde zu Frankfurt-am-Main 1901, p. 63. in the books of the Soncino family of Prague of the seventeenth century,Zunz, Z.G. p. 262. and in one of the prefaces to Shabbethai ben Me√Ør ha-Kohen's notes on the Choshen Mishpat (Amsterdam, 1663).

History Started in 1976 as the Brick Alley Band by Grushecky, a high school special education teacher in Pittsburgh, the band was a fairly typical bar band. It was distinguished by Grushecky's taut, focused songs about life in the heartland and a distinctive, harmonica-and-guitar-driven sound owing much to the Rolling Stones and the J. Geils Band, but which also seemed to borrow the thrashing fury of punk rock. Most of the members of the Iron City Houserockers came from a genuine blue-collar background: Art Nardini was the son of a mechanic and a part-time college student, Joe Grushecky was a coal miner's son, and Gil Snyder's father was a construction worker.Liner notes from Pumping Iron & Sweating Steel: The Best of the Iron City Houserockers In 1977 they signed with Cleveland International Records, headed by former Epic Records A&R; chief and Pittsburgh native Steve Popovich. Popovich christened them the Iron City Houserockers, but this caused some problems when touring outside their native Pittsburgh‚Äîwhen they played Cleveland their tires were slashed. The band's debut album, Love's So Tough, was released in April 1979. With dense, no-frills production by Popovich and Marty Mooney (‚ÄúThe Slimmer Twins‚Äù), the album successfully captured the band's live sound. \\"Hideaway\\" (the first single) and \\"Dance With Me\\" were viewed as standout cuts. The band's follow-up album, Have a Good Time but Get Out Alive!, was featured in Rolling Stone magazine as its showcase review, with the headline \\"New American Classic\\", and The Village Voice called it \\"the strongest album an American band has made this year.\\" The tandem tavern-set tracks \\"Old Man Bar\\" and \\"Junior's Bar\\" were especially praised. Production was credited to the Slimmer Twins and Mick Ronson, with arrangements by Ian Hunter and Steven Van Zandt. According to the liner notes within Pumping Iron & Sweating Steel: The Best of the Iron City Houserockers, Van Zandt left after producing five songs, because of musical differences between him, Hunter and Ronson. The Houserockers' third album, Blood on the Bricks, was produced by Steve Cropper. The 1983 edition of Rolling Stone Record Guide praised it as the band's best album, although it had good marks for all of them. The band then changed its name to simply the Houserockers to avoid the geographic limitation the \\"Iron City\\" moniker had put them in. It also shed the harmonica player Marc Reisman. Ned Rankin quit and was replaced by Ron \\"Byrd\\" Foster (from the recently disbanded Silencers, previously with Sweet Lightning and Roy Buchanan's band), and Gil Snyder added synthesizers to his trademark piano and organ. The subsequent album, Cracking Under Pressure, like all the band's previous efforts, drew critical raves but did not sell well. The band was dropped from MCA Records, shortly after the album's release, and broke up a few months later. Joe Grushecky went on to a modestly successful career on his own, often under the name Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers. He has co-written several songs with another heartland rocker, Bruce Springsteen, and made a number of appearances on stage with him. The Iron City Houserocker's first two albums, Love's So Tough and Have a Good Time but Get Out Alive! were released on compact disc in 1999.

Annunziata; completed by his assistant, Pietro Tacca. Quattro Mori: prisoners at the foot of the Monument of Ferdinand I de' Medici, Livorno. Philip IV of Spain in the centre of Plaza de Oriente in Madrid. thumb Pietro Tacca (16 September 1577 - 26 October 1640) was an Italian sculptor, who was the chief pupil and follower of Giambologna. Tacca began in a Mannerist style and worked in the Baroque style during his maturity. Biography Born in Carrara, Tuscany, he joined Giambologna's atelier in 1592. Tacca took over the workshop of his master on the elder sculptor's death in 1608, finishing a number of Giambologna's incomplete projects, and succeeding him almost immediately as court sculptor to the Medici Grand Dukes of Tuscany. Like his master he took full advantage of the fashion among connoisseurs for table-top reductions of fine bronze sculptures. Louis XIV possessed Giambolognesque bronzes of Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar ( and Heracles and the Cerynian Stag (now Louvre Museum) that are now attributed to Tacca, and dated to the 1620s. . Tacca began by finishing Giambologna's equestrian bronze of Ferdinand de' Medici for the Piazza della SS. Annunziata, a project in which he had participated at every stage, from the terracotta models to the casting process in the fall of 1602 and the finishing (by 1608). This work was cast with the bronze from the cannons of captured Barbary and Ottoman galleys, taken by the Order of Saint Stephen, of which the Grand Duke Ferdinando I de' Medici was Grand Master. Tacca's public works for the Medici include his masterpieces, the \\"Monument of the Four Moors\\", representing captured Barbary corsairs or Ottoman pirates (1620-24) at the foot of Giovanni Bandini's statue of Ferdinand I de' Medici, intended to celebrate the above-mentioned victories, in Piazza della Darsena, Livorno.See Anthea Brook's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. Reduced scale bronze adaptations were made by Foggini and these were to be the basis of reproductions for connoisseurs into the 18th century. Ceramic versions were made by Doccia and other manufacturers.See Anthea Brook's article in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem;;, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. One of Tacca's disciples, Taddeo di Michele, executed a trophy of Barbary arms accompanying the prisoners; it was looted by French troops in 1799 and is now in the Louvre Museum. Fountain in Piazza Santissima Annunziata, Florence. Two bronze fountains originally destined for Livorno (c. 1629), still in a highly Mannerist style indebted to Flemish Mannerist goldsmith's work for their grotesque masks and shellwork textures, were set up instead in Piazza della SS. Annunziata, Florence. For Giambologna's equestrian statue of Cosimo de' Medici in the Piazza della Signoria, Tacca contributed the bas-relief panels on its base. Taking his inspiration from a famous marble copy of a Hellenistic marble boar (Il Cinghiale) in the ducal collection at the Uffizi, Tacca set himself the task of surpassing it: the result is the Porcellino (1612) of the Mercato Nuovo, Florence.Today it is replaced by a copy, the original having been brought indoors. A replica sits outside Sydney Hospital. For Madrid, Tacca executed Giambologna's equestrian bronze of Philip III (1616), which was moved in the 19th century to the Plaza Mayor. For Paris, by order of Marie de Medici he finished Giambologna's equestrian Henry IV (inaugurated August 23, 1613), which stood at the center of the Pont-Neuf but was destroyed in 1792 during the Revolution, then replaced with the present sculpture at the Restauration. Tacca's last public commission was the colossal equestrian bronze of Philip IV, after a design by Vel√°zquez. It is also said to have been based on the iconography of a lost painting by Rubens; it was begun in 1634 and shipped to Madrid in 1640, the year of his death. The sculpture, atop a complicated fountain composition, forms the centerpiece of the fa√ßade of the Royal Palace. The daring stability of the statue was calculated by Galileo Galilei: the horse rears, and the entire weight of the sculpture balances on the two rear legs--and, discreetly, its tail-- a feat that had never been attempted in a figure on a heroic scale, of which Leonardo had dreamed. His son Ferdinando Tacca assisted him in the atelier; the inventory (1687) after his death included sculptures doubtless by Pietro Tacca . The studio was taken over by Giovanni Battista Foggini upon the death of Ferdinando in Florence.

Early life Born as Francis Butters, the eldest of nine siblings, in the Claugton Road, Birkenhead, England, he was the son of a Shropshire father, Francis Turley Butters and a Scottish mother from Dundee, Isabella Neilson Hume. Several accounts explain that because of his large family, Neilson left school at the age of fourteen and moved to the United States at the age of eighteen. Nevertheless, the British Census of 1881 records the Butters' household as having 12 people, including 8 children and two maids. During his days in Liverpool, he attended the Liverpool Institute for Boys. The census also records Francis Butters (Neilson's father) as a restaurant keeper. The same 1881 census records Neilson's paternal grandparents, Richard Butters (born in Market Drayton, Shropshire) and Sarah Turley (born in Snedshill, Shropshire), living at Cemetery Road in Wellington, Shropshire. Move to US In the United States, after arriving in New York City, and paying fifteen dollars for a hansom cab ride from the docks to his guest house, Neilson worked several odd jobs which included a longshoreman, a labourer in Central Park (years later he lived at the Savoy-Plaza, overlooking that same park), and some clerical work. After meeting an African-American man surnamed Johnson, who because of his color worked as a porter despite of his college degree, Neilson became fascinated with education and at times \\"‚Ä¶went hungry to buy books\\". This fascination led him to Henry George, of whom he became a devoted follower. During his stay in the United States, he married Catherine O'Gorman; they had two daughters, Isabel and Marion. Isabel Neilson, an accomplished sculptor, married Prince Hermann Carl Bernhard Ferdinand Friedrich von Saxe- Weimar-Eisenach in 1932 and became Princess Herman of Saxe-Weimar, and Marion Neilson married Captain Hugh Melville, Sam Browne's Cavalry. Theatre and opera Neilson's first success came in the following years after his discovery of Henry George's teachings, where he became well known and respected for his writing, acting, and directing. The Internet Broadway Database, records him as a director of The Little Princess in January 1903, first at the Criterion Theatre and later at the Savoy Theatre; and as the playwright of A Butterfly on The Wheel in January 1912, at the 39th Street Theatre. In New York, he befriended director Anton Seidl who took him to Germany and introduced him to Richard Wagner's family in Bayreuth. This led him out of the United States and back to London. He came back to London as a stage director for Charles Frohman at the Duke of York's Theatre. Later Neilson was invited to direct the national opera at Covent Garden, which he remodelled completely in 1900. The first opera to be produced there was Puccini's Tosca. Puccini himself was at the theatre supervising the production. The encounter of the two men triggered an interest that took Neilson to invite Puccini to see a private performance of the play Madame Butterfly, playing then at the Duke of York's Theatre. Puccini later requested Neilson to direct the opera at La Scala in Milan; however, this never came to pass due to Neilson's other commitments. Political career In the early 1900s, he began his pursuit of politics. His first bid for a parliamentary seat was for the Newport Division of Shropshire; he lost to the incumbent, Colonel Kenyon-Slaney, by a margin of 130 votes. He was elected as Member of Parliament for the constituency of Hyde in Cheshire from 1910 to 1916. During his time in parliament, he was well acquainted with both Prime Ministers: Asquith and Lloyd George. Interested in radical politics, he entered in the progress of the Land Values Movement. His multiple contributions to the liberal agenda made him frequent the Liberal Headquarters, at Parliament Street, and tour the country giving speeches in support of Liberal candidates. He resigned from parliament when his pacifist beliefs conflicted with the First World War. Return to US He returned to the United States, where he became a citizen in 1921 and began pursuing his writing career. In the US, he met Helen Swift, an heiress of the Swift Meat Packing Business and the widow of Edward Morris, President of Morris & Company, another meat packing company. They were married in 1917. Together, they endowed many charities, and contributed to many institutions, including the University of Chicago, Ripon College, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Archaeological Institute of America, the Liverpool Cathedral, and Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Author How Diplomats Make War, was dedicated only six weeks after his resignation from parliament; his antiwar book went through several printings and translations. He went on to write over sixty books, along with many other forms of writing such as articles, plays, and an opera. Neilson co-founded a journal of opinion and literary criticism, titled The Freeman. Legacy In 1935, as President of the Chicago Chapter of the Archaeological Institute of America and in co-ordination with the University of Liverpool, he organised and endowed an archaeological expedition to the Near East, to research lands of biblical time. Archaeologist John Garstang, at the age of sixty, was enthusiastically in charge of the excavations, with much success at the site of the port of Mersin in southern Turkey. A few years before his death, he lost his sight. He was assisted in writing his last book, Ur to Nazareth, by his literary secretary, K. Phyllis Evans. Neilson also wrote a two-volume autobiography, My Life in Two Worlds. Neilson was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to which he donated several paintings, including A Winter Carnival in a Small Flemish Town, Portrait of a Man, Possibly George Frederick Handel, and The Pelkus Gate near Utrecht. Neilson's late wife, Helen Swift Neilson, had bequeathed Portrait of a Young Woman with a Fan, by Rembrandt, for which she had paid $250,000 in 1930; Rembrandt Harmensz (Dutch, 1606‚Äì1669); the Portrait of Mrs. Thomas Pechell, and 1799. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts was given John Singer Sargent's painting A Capriote. The Liverpool Cathedral also received support from Neilson in the form of a collection of Organ and Choral Works which he sponsored; the organ at the Cathedral also bears his name. Death Francis Neilson died, aged 94, on 13 April 1961 in Port Washington, Long Island, New York. He was cremated and his remains taken back to England and interred at the Anglican Liverpool Cathedral.

It is a big-headed, stocky bird, often mistaken for an owl due to its nocturnal habits and similar colouring, and is sometimes, at least archaically, referred to as mopoke or mopawk, also used for the Australian boobook, whose call is often confused with the tawny frogmouth's. In 2019, Australian readers of The Guardian online voted it as the second most popular bird in the Australian Bird of the Year poll. Names Its reconstructed Proto-Pama‚ÄìNyungan name is *tawa or *tawu.Alpher, Barry. 2004. Pama-Nyungan: Phonological Reconstruction and Status as a Phylo-Genetic Group. In Claire Bowern and Harold Koch (eds.), Australian Languages: Classification and the Comparative Method, 93-126, 387-574. Amsterdam: John Benjamins. Taxonomy The tawny frogmouth was first described in 1801 by English naturalist John Latham. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin strix meaning \\"owl\\" and oides meaning \\"form\\". Tawny frogmouths belong to the frogmouth genus Podargus, which includes the two other species of frogmouths found within Australia, the marbled frogmouth and the Papuan frogmouth. The frogmouths form a well-defined group within the order Caprimulgiformes. Although related to owls, their closest relatives are the oilbirds, potoos, owlet-nightjars, and true nightjars. The earliest fossil evidence of frogmouths is from the Eocene and implies that they diverged from their closest relatives during the early Tertiary. Three subspecies of the tawny frogmouth are currently recognised: * P. s. phalaenoides is found throughout Northern Australia southwards to the Great Sandy Desert, Barkly Tableland, and the Gulf of Carpentaria in Queensland. * P. s. brachypterus is found in Western Australia northwards to the Great Sandy Desert, north- eastwards to the Channel Country of Queensland, and south-eastwards to the Murray Mallee in Victoria. * P. s. strigoides is found in Eastern and South Eastern Australia from north of Cooktown, westwards to the inland fringes of the Great Dividing Range, and in Tasmania. Description Rufous morph Tawny frogmouths are large, big-headed birds that can measure from long. Weights have been recorded up to in the wild (and perhaps even more in captivity), but these are exceptionally high.\\"Nightjars and Their Allies\\" by David Holyoak. Oxford University Press (2001), .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . In the nominate race, 55 males were found to weigh a mean of , while 39 females weighed a mean of , with a range between both of . Among the subspecies P. s. brachypterus, 20 unsexed birds were found to average with a range of . In P. s. phalaenoides, a weight range of was reported.Del Hoyo, J., Elliot, A., & Sargatal, J. (1992). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Barcelona: Lynx Editions. Thus, in terms of average if not maximal body mass, the tawny is a bit smaller than its relative, the Papuan frogmouth. Tawny frogmouths are stocky and compact with rounded wings and short legs. They have wide, heavy, olive-grey to blackish bills that are hooked at the tip and topped with distinctive tufts of bristles. Their eyes are large and yellow, a trait shared by owls.Tawny Frogmouth However they are not forward facing like an owls. Tawny frogmouths have three distinct colour morphs, grey being the most common in both sexes. Males of this morph have silver-grey upperparts with black streaks and slightly paler underparts with white barring and brown to rufous mottling. Females of this morph are often darker with more rufous mottling. Females of the subspecies P. s. strigoides have a chestnut morph and females of the subspecies P. s. phalaenoides have a rufous morph. Leucistic or albinistic all-white aberrant plumage for this species has been documented. =Camouflage= Camouflaged tawny frogmouths blend in with colour and texture of tree bark in Sydney. Camouflaged tawny frogmouth couple in afternoon sun, Melbourne One of the best examples of cryptic plumage and mimicry in Australian birds is seen in the tawny frogmouth, which perch low on tree branches during the day camouflaged as part of the tree. Their silvery-grey plumage patterned with white, black, and brown streaks and mottles allows them to freeze into the form of a broken tree branch and become practically invisible in broad daylight.\\"Tawny Frogmouth Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo\\" The tawny frogmouth often chooses a broken part of a tree branch and perches upon it with its head thrust upwards at an acute angle using its very large, broad beak to emphasise the resemblance. Often, a pair sits together and points their heads upwards, only breaking cover if approached closely to take flight or warn off predators. When threatened, adult tawny frogmouths make an alarm call that signals to chicks to remain silent and immobile, ensuring that the natural camouflage provided by the plumage is not broken. =Differences from owls= Tawny frogmouths and owls both have mottled patterns, wide eyes, and anisodactyl feet. However, owls possess strong legs, powerful talons, and toes with a unique flexible joint they use to catch prey. Tawny frogmouths prefer to catch their prey with their beaks and have fairly weak feet. They roost out in the open, relying on camouflage for defence, and build their nests in tree forks, whereas owls roost hidden in thick foliage and build their nests in tree hollows. Tawny frogmouths have wide, forward-facing beaks for catching insects, whereas owls have narrow, downwards-facing beaks used to tear prey apart. The eyes of tawny frogmouths are to the side of the face, while the eyes of owls are fully forward on the face. Furthermore, owls have full or partial face discs and large, asymmetrical ears, while tawny frogmouths do not. Distribution and habitat Tawny frogmouths are found throughout most of the Australian mainland except in far western Queensland, the central Northern Territory, and most of the Nullabor Plain. In Tasmania, they are common throughout the northern and eastern parts of the state. They can be found in almost any habitat type, including forests and woodlands, scrub and heathland vegetation, and savannahs. However, they are rarely seen in heavy rainforests and treeless deserts. They are seen in large numbers in areas populated with many river gums and casuarinas, and can be found along river courses if these areas are timbered. Tawny frogmouths are common in suburbs, having adapted to human presence. They have been reported nesting in parks and gardens with trees. Behaviour and ecology =Diet and feeding= Tawny frogmouth skull Tawny frogmouths are carnivorous and are considered to be among Australia's most effective pest-control birds, as their diet consists largely of species regarded as vermin or pests in houses, farms, and gardens. The bulk of their diet is composed of large nocturnal insects, such as moths, as well as spiders, worms, slugs, and snails but also includes a variety of bugs, beetles, wasps, ants, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpions. Large numbers of invertebrates are consumed to make up sufficient biomass. Small mammals, reptiles, frogs, and birds are also eaten. During daylight hours, healthy tawny frogmouths generally do not actively look for food, though they may sit with their mouths open, snapping them shut when an insect enters. As dusk approaches, they begin actively searching for food. Tawny frogmouths feed mainly by pouncing from a tree or other elevated perch to take large insects or small vertebrates from the ground using their beaks with great precision. Some smaller prey, such as moths, can be caught in flight. Foraging flights consist of short, snatching flights to foliage, branches, or into the air. Tawny frogmouths do not consume prey collected on the ground or in flight on the spot unless it is very small. The captured prey is held in the tip of the beak and taken to a nearby branch, where it is then processed. Insects are generally pulped at the rim of the beak before being swallowed, and larger prey such as lizards or mice are generally killed before consumption by being bashed against a branch with great force. =Bonding and breeding= Chicks 5 days after hatching, Melbourne Tawny frogmouth with two 32-day-old chicks, Melbourne Tawny frogmouths form partnerships for life, and once established, pairs usually stay in the same territory for a decade or more. Establishing and maintaining physical contact is an integral part of their lifelong bond. During breeding season, pairs roost closely together on the same branch, often with their bodies touching. The male carries out grooming by gently stroking through the plumage of the female with his beak in sessions that can last for 10 minutes or more. The breeding season of tawny frogmouths is from August to December, but individuals in arid areas are known to breed in response to heavy rains. Males and females both share in the building of nests by collecting twigs and mouthfuls of leaves and dropping them into position. Nests are usually placed on horizontal, forked tree branches and can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. Loose sticks are piled together, and leaf litter and grass stems are placed to soften the centre. The nests are very fragile and can disintegrate easily. The clutch size of the tawny frogmouth is one to three eggs. Both sexes share incubation of the eggs during the night, whilst during the day, males incubate the eggs. For the duration of the incubation period, the nest is rarely left unattended. One partner roosts on a nearby branch and provides food for the brooding partner. Once hatched, both parents cooperate in the supply of food to the young. The fledging period of the tawny frogmouth is 25 ‚Äì 35 days, during which they develop half their adult mass. =Vocalisations= Tawny frogmouths have a wide range of vocalisations that can signal information about sex, territory, food, or predators. They generally use low-amplitude and low-frequency sounds to communicate, though some of their warning screams can be heard for miles. Nestlings make a number of unique calls expressing distress, hunger, and fear. Juveniles retain this range while developing a loud call for begging. Nestlings, juveniles, and adults all use a low-amplitude annoyance call meant for family members. When disturbed during rest, they can emit a soft warning buzz that sounds similar to a bee, and when threatened, they can make a loud hissing noise and produce clacking sounds with their beaks. At night, tawny frogmouths emit a deep and continuous \\"oom-oom-oom\\" grunting at a frequency of about eight calls in 5 seconds. The steady grunts are often repeated a number of times throughout the night. They also make a soft, breathy \\"whoo-whoo-whoo\\" call at night of lower intensity, but at the same frequency. Before and during breeding season, males and females perform duets consisting of call sequences that either alternate between partners or are performed simultaneously. Tawny frogmouths also make distinctive drumming noises during breeding season. =Thermoregulation= Pair of tawny frogmouths in Brisbane Botanical Gardens The wide distribution range of the tawny frogmouth includes areas of the Australian continent where winter night temperatures regularly approach or grow colder than 0¬∞C and warm summers can have extremes above 40¬∞C. The high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter provide a thermoregulatory challenge for tawny frogmouths that roost all day out in the open. Significant differences in the orientation of tawny frogmouths on branches has been observed during winter and summer. During summer when light intensity is at maximum strength, they tend to choose positions on branches that do not have all-day exposure to sunlight. Physiological testing has shown that they are able to triple their breathing rate without the need to open their beaks. However, when their body temperature rises by as much as 4-5¬∞, they begin to pant. Faced with further heat stress, tawny frogmouths engorge the blood vessels in the mouth to increase the flow of blood to the buccal area and produce a mucus that helps to cool air as it is inhaled, and hence cool the body. During winter, tawny frogmouths choose northerly oriented positions on branches that are more exposed to sunlight to increase body heat. Pair roosting and huddling to share body warmth is also common during winter. During daylight, tawny frogmouths sometimes perch on the ground to sunbathe, remaining motionless up to 5 minutes. During this time, the birds open their beaks wide, close their eyes, and move their heads to the side to allow sunrays to penetrate beneath the thick layer of feathers. =Torpor= During winter, the food supply shrinks drastically and prewinter body fat stores can only provide a limited supply of energy. Tawny frogmouths are unable to survive the winter months without spending much of their days and nights in torpor. Torpor results in energy conservation by significantly slowing down heart rate and metabolism, which lowers body temperature. Torpor is different from hibernation in that it only lasts for relatively short periods of time, usually a few hours. Shallow torpor lasts for several hours and is a regular, daily occurrence in the winter. Dawn torpor bouts are shorter and temperature reduction may be as small as 0.5 to 1.5¬∞C, while night torpor bouts last several hours and can reduce body temperature by up to 10¬∞C. Conservation and threats Perching on a balcony in Sydney, Australia The conservation status of tawny frogmouths is \\"least concern\\" due to their widespread distribution. However, a number of ongoing threats to the health of the population are known. Many bird and mammalian carnivores are known to prey upon the tawny frogmouth. Native birds, including ravens, butcherbirds, and currawongs, may attempt or steal the protein-rich eggs to feed their own young. Birds of prey such as hobbies and falcons, as well as rodents and tree-climbing snakes, also cause major damage to the clutches by taking eggs and nestlings. In subtropical areas where food is available throughout the year, tawny frogmouths sometimes start brooding earlier in winter to avoid the awakening of snakes after hibernation. Since 1998, a cluster of cases of neurological disease has occurred in tawny frogmouths in the Sydney area, caused by the parasite Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a rat lungworm. =Human impact= Tawny frogmouths face a number of threats from human activities and pets. They are often killed or injured on rural roads during feeding, as they fly in front of cars when chasing insects illuminated in the beam of the headlights. Large-scale land clearing of eucalypt trees and intense bushfires are serious threats to their populations, as they tend not to move to other areas if their homes are destroyed. House cats are the most significant introduced predator of the tawny frogmouth, but dogs and foxes are known to also occasionally kill the birds. When tawny frogmouths pounce to catch prey on the ground, they are slow to return to flight and vulnerable to attack from these predators. As they have adapted to live in close proximity to human populations, tawny frogmouths are at high risk of exposure to pesticides. Continued widespread use of insecticides and rodent poisons are hazardous as they remain in the system of the target animal and can be fatal to a tawny frogmouth that eats them. The effect of these toxins is often indirect, as they can be absorbed into fatty tissue with the bird experiencing no overt signs of ill health until the winter, when the fat deposits are drawn on and the poison enters the bloodstream.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 9, 1995. The episode was written by Mike Scully and directed by Bob Anderson. Frank Welker guest stars as Santa's Little Helper and various other dogs. In the episode, Santa's Little Helper has puppies with a dog that he met at the greyhound racetrack. The episode is inspired by Walt Disney Pictures' 1961 animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. The producers decided to have Mr. Burns communicate his horrific plan of making a tuxedo from the puppies through a musical number, \\"See My Vest\\", after determining that it would be a \\"fun and light\\" way to convey his plan of killing the greyhounds. \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" received a generally positive reception from television critics. During the week of its original broadcast, the episode finished 55th in ratings, with a Nielsen rating of 7.3. Several reviews considered the episode to be among the best in the series, with Mr. Burns' role and the \\"See My Vest\\" sequence being singled out for praise. Plot The Simpson family's dog, Santa's Little Helper, runs away from home to the dog racing track, where he mates with a female greyhound named She's the Fastest. She gives birth to a litter of 25 puppies after her owner, the Rich Texan, gives her to the Simpsons. They quickly become too difficult to manage, so Homer and Marge try giving them away. They soon find that the puppies do not like being separated, so Mr. Burns offers to take them all. Fearing he will mistreat them, Lisa persuades her parents to refuse Burns' offer, but he and Smithers secretly steal the puppies. After Chief Wiggum casually remarks that Burns has the puppies, Bart and Lisa sneak into Burns Manor. They are surprised to see him bathing and doting on the dogs. One of them stands up on its hind legs, reminding Burns of actor Rory Calhoun; he names this one \\"Little Monty.\\" Bart and Lisa learn that he plans to kill the other 24 puppies and make a tuxedo from their pelts when he performs a song, using his wardrobe of macabre clothing fashioned from animal hides to make several costume changes. Bart and Lisa slip inside the mansion to retrieve the litter. The children and puppies slide down a laundry chute to the basement, where Burns and Smithers are waiting for them. To trick Burns into freeing the puppies, Bart mixes them up so that he cannot tell which one is Little Monty. After Little Monty stands on Burns' command, Bart reels a clothesline so that socks dangle overhead to get all the puppies to stand. Burns briefly considers killing all the puppies and the children, but cannot bring himself to do it since they all remind him of Calhoun. The Simpsons then let Burns keep the puppies, who grow to become world champion racing dogs and earn him millions of dollars in prize money, angering Homer. Production =Inspiration, writing, and music= alt=A man speaks into a microphone. \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" was written by Mike Scully and directed by Bob Anderson. The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the original idea for the episode. The idea came to them after watching the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. David Mirkin, the episode's show runner, later jokingly said that Jean and Reiss liked to steal ideas from Disney, and pointed to an episode in season eight that they wrote as proof, titled \\"Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious\\", which was based on the 1964 Disney film Mary Poppins. Mirkin thought that it was great that they could take stuff from Disney and do darker versions on The Simpsons \\"in a completely legal way\\". Matt Groening was happy with the episode because he thought it felt like a callback to the first episode of The Simpsons, \\"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\\", and because it features references to One Hundred and One Dalmatians. The Disney film thrilled Groening as a child, and was one of the reasons he was first interested in animation and cartooning. In One Hundred and One Dalmatians, the puppies watch cartoons on television several times; the idea of a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening, and said that this idea inspired him to create The Itchy & Scratchy Show, a fictional television show within the Simpsons universe. Mr. Burns says in the episode that the puppy that stands up only on its hind legs reminds him of Rory Calhoun, an American actor who lived from 1922 to 1999. The Simpsons writer George Meyer came up with the joke, but Groening argued against it because he did not think the audience would know who Calhoun was. The writers decided to keep it in anyway, because it was later expanded into a key part of the episode's ending. Several years later, Groening stated that he was proven correct after pointing to discussions on the Internet about the episode asking who Calhoun was. As Bart and Lisa sneak away to Mr. Burns' mansion, they see him loading a gun and singing a musical number called \\"See My Vest\\", in which he proclaims his intention to kill the puppies to make a tuxedo out of them. When the staff discussed how they could gloss over the horrifying things Mr. Burns would do to the dogs, one of the writers suggested that if they communicated his plan through a song, it would stay \\"fun and light\\". Scully, who agreed that the idea was good, came in the following day with complete lyrics that he wrote for \\"See My Vest\\", which was a parody of the song \\"Be Our Guest\\", sung by Jerry Orbach in the 1991 film Beauty and the Beast. Mirkin loved Scully's work on the parody song, commenting, \\"The rhymes are really clever. It's one of our very best songs [on The Simpsons].\\" He also liked the fact that songs could be used in episodes of The Simpsons without the episodes turning into musicals, saying, \\"We'll just do one song and that's plenty. We have fun with that and then we're out.\\" =Animation and voice acting= Even though animals in cartoons often behave with \\"semi-human awareness\\", Groening said he preferred animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life, claiming that this was how animals were depicted in \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\". Mirkin said there were some exceptions for gags, but most of the time they tried to keep the animals acting realistically. The animal noises for the episode were performed by Frank Welker, who was praised by Mirkin on the DVD audio commentary for the episode, saying, \\"He can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy, and he's a pleasure to work with.\\" Welker was also praised by Groening, who said Welker was unbelievably good at doing animal noises. The staff had a \\"big fight\\" with the Fox network censors over the scene in which Santa's Little Helper mates with She's The Fastest. The writers were originally worried about the idea, but Mirkin knew that they could show the dogs having sex in a manner that was not explicit. In the scene's final version, the dogs are only seen from the shoulders up; the crew's animatic showing the scene in full was later released on DVD. Anderson noted that during the episode's censor screening, there was a giant laugh at the depiction. Cultural references The overarching plot of the episode and its title are inspired by the Walt Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians. In a reference to the film itself, the greyhounds are shown watching television in one scene. The program they are watching is Models, Inc. Mr. Burns' song \\"See My Vest\\" is a parody of \\"Be Our Guest\\" from Beauty and the Beast. The scene in which Santa's Little Helper and She's the Fastest are presented with a plate of spaghetti at Luigi's Italian restaurant parodies Lady and the Tramp. The clerk performing a mind-meld on Santa's Little Helper is a reference to the Vulcan mind-meld ability in Star Trek; the same music from the mind-meld scenes in Star Trek are played during the scene. At one point, Santa's Little Helper looks wistfully out the window of the Simpson family's car, and then morphs out of the car window in reference to a similar scene in Terminator 2: Judgment Day; music from that film plays in the background. Four of the puppies are named Jay, David, Paul, and Branford, a reference to late- night talkshow hosts David Letterman and Jay Leno and their respective bandleaders Paul Shaffer and Branford Marsalis. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" finished 55th in ratings for the week of April 3‚Äì9, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 7.3. The song \\"See My Vest\\" from the episode, sung by Mr. Burns, was later released on the album Songs in the Key of Springfield in 1997. The Daily Bruin complimented the song's lyrics as witty, and claimed that by listening to the song, memories of the episode came to mind. They noted how the musical piece revealed Mr. Burns' essence of character, and that it also commented on some disturbing elements of humankind. MSNBC compiled a list of \\"TV‚Äôs top 10 scariest characters\\", placing Mr. Burns at number one. In the list, they noted, \\"Burns is terrifying because he will do absolutely anything, and since it's a cartoon, he just might\\", pointing to \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" and his plans to make the puppies into a tuxedo as proof. In a review by the Toronto Star, Ben Rayner commented that \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" was one of his favorite episodes of the series, and concluded that Mr. Burns' \\"tour de force\\" performance was particularly captivating. The Toronto Star later produced a list of the best and worst The Simpsons episodes, in which they considered \\"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\\" one of the best episodes of the series and concluded that the musical number was one of the best scenes involving Mr. Burns. In a review for the sixth season DVD of The Simpsons, IGN's Todd Gilchrist found Mr. Burns' performance to be memorable, commenting that he \\"flirts with copyright infringement with his rendition of 'See My Vest'\\". Michael Price of IGN also considered Burns' performance to have reached a level of excellence comparable to \\"The Monorail Song\\" in \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\". In a review for The Simpsons season six DVD, review website DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B‚àí. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson appreciated the spoofs of Disney films, and also complimented \\"the most bizarre references to Rory Calhoun imaginable\\", concluding that the combination of these elements formed a \\"fine show\\".

This is typically below the thermocline, the vertical zone in the water through which temperature drops rapidly. The temperature difference may be large enough to hamper mixing with the littoral zone in some seasons which causes a decrease in oxygen concentrations. The profundal is often defined, as the deepest, vegetation-free, and muddy zone of the lacustrine benthal. The profundal zone is often part of the aphotic zone. Sediment in the profundal zone primarily comprises silt and mud.  Organisms  The lack of light and oxygen in the profundal zone determines the type of biological community that can live in this region and this is distinctly different from the community in the overlying waters. The profundal macrofauna is therefore characterized by physiological and behavioural adaptations to low oxygen concentration. While benthic fauna differs between lakes, Chironomidae and Oligochaetae often dominate the benthic fauna of the profundal zone because they possess hemoglobin-like molecules to extract oxygen from poorly oxygenated water. Due to the low productivity of the profundal zone, organisms rely on detritus sinking from the photic zone. Species richness in the profundal zone is often similar to that in the limnetic zone. Microbial levels in the profundal benthos are higher than those in the littoral benthos, potentially due to a smaller average sediment particle size. Benthic macroinvertebrates are believed to be regulated by top-down pressure.  Nutrient cycling  Nutrient fluxes in the profundal zone are primarily driven by release from the benthos. The anoxic nature of the profundal zone drives ammonia release from benthic sediment. This can drive phytoplankton production, to the point of a phytoplankton bloom, and create toxic conditions for many organisms, particularly at a high pH. Hypolimnetic anoxia can also contribute to buildups of iron, manganese, and sulfide in the profundal zone.

Family and peerage Charles was born in England, the eldest son of General Lord Charles FitzRoy and Frances Mundy. His grandfather, Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, was the Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1768 to 1770. He was notably a sixth-generation descendant of King Charles II and the 1st Duchess of Cleveland; the surname FitzRoy stems from this illegitimacy. Charles' half brother Robert FitzRoy would become a pioneering meteorologist and surveyor, Captain of HMS Beagle, and later Governor of New Zealand. Early life Charles FitzRoy was educated at the Harrow School in London, before receiving a commission in the Royal Horse Guards regiment of the British Army at the age of 16. Just after his 19th birthday, FitzRoy's regiment took part in the Battle of Waterloo, where as an extra aide-de-camp on Wellington's staff he was wounded. He travelled to Lower Canada with the Duke of Richmond in 1818. On 11 March 1820, he married Lady Mary Lennox (daughter of the Duke of Richmond), just after his promotion to Captain. In 1825, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and appointed Deputy Adjutant General of the Cape Colony (now the Cape of Good Hope). Governor of Prince Edward Island and the Leeward Islands Sir Charles was appointed as the eleventh Governor of Prince Edward Island off the coast of Canada on 31 March 1837, and was granted a knighthood just before his departure. He returned to England in 1841 and shortly afterwards was made Governor of the Leeward Islands in the West Indies until 1845. Governor of New South Wales Sir Charles was chosen as the tenth Governor of the colony of New South Wales by Lord Stanley in 1845. FitzRoy replaced Sir George Gipps as governor who had been a strong ruler but had provoked the animosity of many in the colony. It is likely that FitzRoy was chosen because he tended to be more appeasing in his approach. FitzRoy, his wife and his son George arrived in the colony on board on 2 August 1846. Soon after his arrival he was asked to use his influence to procure the disallowance of an act of the Tasmanian legislature imposing a duty of 15% on products imported from New South Wales. Fitzroy brought before the British government the advisability of some superior functionary being appointed, to whom all measures passed by local legislatures should be referred before being assented to. In the long discussion over the separation of the Port Phillip district, Fitzroy showed tact and himself favoured bi-cameral legislatures for the new constitutions. The need for some type of federation between the various colonies was recognised, and as a step towards this Fitzroy was given a commission in 1850 appointing him governor-general of the Australian colonies. During his governorship great steps were made in the development of New South Wales. Transportation of convicts ceased, the Sydney University was founded, a branch of the royal mint was established and responsible government was granted. In 1847, Fitzroy served briefly as Governor of the Colony of North Australia, although his lieutenant-governor, George Barney had the main responsibility for establishing the new colony under FitzRoy's direction. His decision in 1847 to allow the building of a horse racing track in Parramatta was the catalyst for the creation of Cumberland Oval, a venue which hosted racing, cricket, and in the 20th century, motorsports & was the location that Parramatta Stadium was built upon. After sixteen months in the colony, Sir Charles' wife Mary was killed in a coach accident on 7 December 1847. A distraught FitzRoy considered resigning and returning to England, but his finances did not permit it. A memorial to Lady Mary Fitzroy is in St James' Church, Sydney. In 1851 he named Grafton, New South Wales, after his grandfather Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton. Sir Charles remained in New South Wales for eight eventful years, which saw many changes take place in the Australian colonies, not in the least being the first tentative steps towards Federation of the Australian states. In 1853, FitzRoy was appointed as Governor of Van Diemen's Land, South Australia and Victoria ‚Äì essentially a pre-Federation Governor-General of Australia, with wide-ranging powers to intervene in inter-colonial disputes. Later years and death On 28 January 1855 he departed Australia and returned to England. On 11 September, his eldest son Augustus (a Captain in the Royal Regiment of Artillery) was killed in the Crimean War. On 11 December, he married Margaret Gordon (widow of a Melbourne land agent). FitzRoy died in London on 16 February 1858 at the age of 61. Family St James' Church, Sydney Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy married, firstly, Lady Mary Lennox (15 August 1790 ‚Äì 7 December 1847), first- born child of Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond, on 11 March 1820. They had 4 children: * Captain Augustus Charles Lennox FitzRoy (20 September 1821 ‚Äì 11 September 1855) * Mary Caroline FitzRoy (20 December 1823 ‚Äì 22 November 1895) married Admiral Hon. Keith Stewart, son of The Earl of Galloway * George Henry FitzRoy (13 September 1826 ‚Äì 8 July 1868) * Commander Arthur George FitzRoy (20 March 1827 ‚Äì 9 January 1861) Lady Mary died from a carriage accident in Parramatta Park, outside Government House, in 1847. Within a year of her death, rumours were circulated about the colony of New South Wales about FitzRoy's 'womanising' ways. In 1850, FitzRoy made a visit to Berrima, to inspect the Fitzroy IronWorks. The Governor stayed at the Surveyor General's Inn, operated by former boxing champion Edward \\"Ned\\" Chalker (sometimes Charker). Ned's step-daughter, Mary Ann Chalker, who was 18 at the time, worked there. Nine months later, she gave birth to a son, named Charles Augustus FitzRoy, after his father, the Governor.Sunday Mirror, 16 September 1962, page 36 This boy was later adopted by ex-convict John Fitzsimons and his family. * Charles Augustus FitzRoy Fitzsimons (9 November 1850 ‚Äì 19 July 1921) Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy married, secondly (after his return to England), Margaret Gordon, on 11 December 1855. There was no issue from this marriage.

Saraswathi Mahal Library, also called Thanjavur Maharaja Serfojis Sarawswathi Mahal Library is a library located in Thanjavur (Tanjore), Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the oldest libraries in Asia established during 16th century by Nayakas of Tanjavur and has on display a rare collection of Palm leaf manuscripts and paper written in Tamil and Sanskrit and a few other languages indigenous to India. The collection comprises well over 49,000 volumes, though only a tiny fraction of these are on display. The library has a complete catalog of holdings, which is being made available online. Some rare holdings can be viewed on site by prior arrangement.See official website of the library, under External links, for details of holdings and access.  History  The Saraswathi Mahal library was started by Nayak Kings of Tanjavur as a Royal Library for the private intellectual enrichment of Kings and their family of Thanjavur (see Nayaks of Tanjore) who ruled from 1535 CE till 1676 CE. The Maratha rulers who captured Thanjavur in 1675 promoted local culture and further developed the Royal Palace Library until 1855. Most notable among the Maratha Kings was Serfoji II (1798‚Äì1832), who was an eminent scholar in many branches of learning and the arts. In his early age Sarfoji studied under the influence of the German Reverent Schwartz, and learned many languages including English, French, Italian and Latin. He enthusiastically took special interest in the enrichment of the Library, employing many Pandits to collect, buy and copy a vast number of works from all renowned Centres of Sanskrit learning in Northern India and other far-flung areas. During 1918 the Saraswathi Mahal Library was open to public. The Library is located within the campus of Tanjavur palace.  Efforts  Painting outside the Sarasvati Mahal Library. The library is open to the public; it also supports efforts to publish rare manuscripts from the collection, as well as ensuring all volumes are preserved on microfilm. The Library has installed computers in 1998 for the Computerisation of Library activities. As a first phase, the Library catalogues are being stored in the Computer for easy information retrieval. It is also proposed to digitalise the manuscripts of this Library shortly.  The Collection  The bulk of the manuscripts (39,300) are in Tamil and Sanskrit. Manuscripts number over 4500, comprising titles in literature and medicine. The Library has a collection of 3076 Marathi manuscripts from the South Indian Maharastrian of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries; this includes the hierarchy of the Saints of Maharashtra belonging to Sri Ramadasi and Dattatreya Mutts. The Marathi manuscripts are mostly on paper but a few were written in Telugu script on palm-leaf. There are 846 Telugu manuscripts in the holdings, mostly on palm leaf. There are 22 Persian and Urdu manuscripts mostly of 19th century also within the collection. The library also holds medical records of Ayurveda scholars, including patient case studies and interviews in the manuscripts classified under the Dhanvantari section. Apart from these manuscripts there are 1342 bundles of Maratha Raj records available at the Library. The Raj records were written in the Modi script (fast script for Devanagari) of the Marathi language. These records encompass the information of the political, cultural and social administration of the Maratha kings of Thanjavur.

An airborne collision avoidance system (ACAS, usually pronounced as ay-kas) operates independently of ground-based equipment and air traffic control in warning pilots of the presence of other aircraft that may present a threat of collision. If the risk of collision is imminent, the system initiates a maneuver that will reduce the risk of collision. ACAS standards and recommended practices are mainly defined in annex 10, volume IV, of the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Much of the technology being applied to both military and general aviation today has been undergoing development by NASA and other partners since the 1980s. A distinction is increasingly being made between ACAS and ASAS (airborne separation assurance system). ACAS is being used to describe short-range systems intended to prevent actual metal-on-metal collisions. In contrast, ASAS is being used to describe longer-range systems used to maintain standard en route separation between aircraft ( horizontal and vertical).[Hoekstra, J.M. (2002). Free flight with airborne separation assurance. Report No. NLR-TP-2002-170. National Aerospace Laboratory NLR.] As of 2009, the only implementations that meets the ACAS II standards set by ICAO are Versions 7.0 and 7.1 of TCAS II (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) produced by three manufacturers: Rockwell Collins, Honeywell and ACSS (Aviation Communication & Surveillance Systems; an L-3 Communications and Thales Avionics company). As of 1973, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standard for transponder minimal operational performance, Technical Standard Order (TSO) C74c, contained errors which caused compatibility problems with air traffic control radar beacon system (ATCRBS) radar and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) abilities to detect aircraft transponders. First called \\"The Terra Problem\\", there have since been individual FAA Airworthiness Directives issued against various transponder manufacturers in an attempt to repair the operational deficiencies, to enable newer radars and TCAS systems to operate. Unfortunately, the defect is in the TSO, and the individual corrective actions to transponders have led to significant differences in the logical behavior of transponders by make and mark, as proven by an FAA study of in-situ transponders. In 2009, a new version, TSO C74d was defined with tighter technical requirements. AIS-P is a modification which both corrects the transponder deficiencies (the transponder will respond to all varieties of radar and TCAS), then adds an Automatic Independent Surveillance with Privacy augmentation. The AIS-P protocol does not suffer from the saturation issue in high density traffic, does not interfere with the Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar system or TCAS, and conforms to the internationally approved Mode S data packet standard. It awaits member country submission to the ICAO as a requested approval. Modern aircraft can use several types of collision avoidance systems to prevent unintentional contact with other aircraft, obstacles, or the ground: Footage from the head-up-display of a U.S. Air Force Arizona Air National Guard F-16 records a save by the aircraft's Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS) during a training mission, the fourth confirmed by the NASA-designed system. From an altitude of just over 17,000 ft, the pilot executes an 8.1g maneuver which causes the pilot to lose consciousness. After the aircraft enters a steepening dive in full afterburner for twenty seconds, Auto-GCAS intervenes with a recovery maneuver at 8,760 ft. 652 kt and nose-down almost 55 deg. below the horizon. * Airborne radar can detect the relative location of other aircraft, and has been in military use since World War II, when it was introduced to help night fighters (such as the de Havilland Mosquito and Messerschmitt Bf 110) locate bombers. While larger civil aircraft carry weather radar, sensitive anti-collision radar is rare in non-military aircraft. * Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), actively interrogates the transponders of other aircraft and negotiates collision- avoidance tactics with them in case of a threat. TCAS systems are relatively expensive, and tend to appear only on larger aircraft. They are effective in avoiding collisions only with other aircraft that are equipped with functioning transponders with altitude reporting. * Small PCAS device for use in light aircraft.a Portable Collision Avoidance System (PCAS) is a less expensive, passive version of TCAS designed for general aviation use. PCAS systems do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft, but listen passively to responses from other interrogations. PCAS is subject to the same limitations as TCAS, although the cost for PCAS is significantly less. * FLARM is a small-size, low-power device (commonly used in gliders or other light aircraft) which broadcasts its own position and speed vector (as obtained with an integrated GPS) over a license-free ISM band radio transmission. At the same time it listens to other devices based on the same standard. Intelligent motion prediction algorithms predict short-term conflicts and warn the pilot accordingly by acoustical and visual means. FLARM incorporates a high-precision WAAS 16-channel GPS receiver and an integrated low-power radio transceiver. Static obstacles are included in FLARM's database. No warning is given if an aircraft does not contain an additional FLARM device. * a Ground proximity warning system (GPWS), or Ground collision warning system (GCWS), which uses a radar altimeter to detect proximity to the ground or unusual descent rates. GPWS is common on civil airliners and larger general aviation aircraft. * a Terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) uses a digital terrain map, together with position information from a navigation system such as GPS, to predict whether the aircraft's current flight path could put it in conflict with obstacles such as mountains or high towers, that would not be detected by GPWS (which uses the ground elevation directly beneath the aircraft). One of the best examples of this type of technology is the Auto-GCAS (Ground Collision Avoidance System) and PARS (Pilot Activated Recovery System) that was installed on the entire USAF fleet of F-16's in 2014. * Synthetic vision provides pilots with a computer- generated simulation of their outside environment for use in low or zero- visibility situations. Information used to present warnings is often taken from GPS, INS, or gyroscopic sensors. * Obstacle Collision Avoidance System is a ground based system that uses a low powered radar mounted on or near the obstacle. The radar detects aircraft in the proximity of the obstacle and firstly warns aircraft via flashing medium intensity lights and secondly warns aircraft of the obstacle via a VHF broadcast. No additional equipment is required on board the aircraft. Large, sophisticated aircraft may use several or all of these systems, while a small general aviation aircraft might have only PCAS or benefit from the OCAS system, or no collision-avoidance system at all (other than the pilot's situational awareness).

Their community outreach involves signing people up for guided vegan challenges, distributing printed informational booklets, showing virtual reality videos, and organizing vegan chef challenges. As of January 2020, over 30 million hard copies of the group's booklets have been handed out by Vegan Outreach staff and volunteers around the world. Originally known as Animal Liberation Action (ALA), the group was founded by Matt Ball and Jack Norris in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1993.For an article about Norris's wedding, see Strobel, Mike. \\"I think I smell a stunt\\", Toronto Sun, September 12, 2008. *Also see Cooney, Scott. \\"Starting an environmental non-profit\\", Ecopreneurist, February 3, 2009. History As members of the Animal Rights Community of Cincinnati, Matt Ball and Jack Norris (along with Phil Murray, now co-owner of Pangea Vegan Products) spent the winter of 1990‚Äì1991 holding fur protests outside cultural events. Their focus turned to vegetarianism in 1992, and the Animal Rights Community of Cincinnati funded the printing and distribution of 10,000 pro-vegetarian flyers entitled Vegetarianism. In June 1993, twelve activists‚Äîincluding Ball and Norris‚Äîheld a three-day \\"Fast for Farm Animals\\" in front of a Cincinnati slaughterhouse. On the last day of the fast, some of the protesters took a large banner reading \\"Stop Eating Animals\\" to the University of Cincinnati campus. Following this event, Ball and Norris formed Animal Liberation Action (ALA) and started a campaign of holding \\"Stop Eating Animals\\" banners on street corners. In 1994, ALA developed a booklet called And Justice For All. It focused on the reasons to adopt a vegan diet, focusing on the abuse of the animals involved. The following year, ALA's name was officially changed to Vegan Outreach. Massive Community Outreach Vegan Outreach's key personnel are based in the U.S and Canada, Mexico, India, Australia, and Kenya. Staff and volunteers conduct outreach with the aim of signing people up for online guided vegan challenges. Community outreach takes place on about 1,000 colleges and high school campuses each semester, as well as at vegfests, cat and dog festivals, Comic-Cons, yoga festivals, farmers markets, and other fairs and conventions worldwide. Outreach involves free vegan food samples, showing virtual reality videos, and tabling with their persuasive booklets like \\"What is Speciesism?\\" and \\"Why Vegan.\\" Their booklets have been distributed in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, ten Canadian territories and provinces, Mexico, and numerous other countries (including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Egypt, England, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, Sri Lanka, South Africa, and Taiwan). Vegan Outreach also organizes vegan chef challenges in cities across the U.S. in which local, meat-based restaurants add vegan dishes for a month and compete for prizes, usually resulting in restaurants permanently keeping vegan items on their menu. They also provide a vegan mentorship program for individual, one-on-one guidance in over 1,000 cities and dozens of countries. Vegan Outreach also partners with restaurants, grocery stores, airports, and wholesale companies to guide them in adding plant-based options to their menus, shelves, and cafeterias.

He holds the record for longest-tenured NFL broadcaster in U.S. TV history, calling NFL football for 47 seasons (1967-2013) on NBC and CBS. Criqui's final NFL broadcast came on December 8, 2013, when he filled in for Bill Macatee as he was having traveling issues in a snow storm in Dallas, calling the 27-26 New England Patriots victory over the Cleveland Browns. Criqui's most recent network assignment was CBS Sports from 1998 until 2013, where he called the NFL, women's and men's college basketball and college football. From 1995 to 2012, he was the voice of New England Patriots pre-season football with Randy Cross. From 2006 until 2017, Criqui served as the football radio play-by-play voice for Notre Dame, his alma mater. Early life Criqui is a native of Buffalo, New York and grew up in the suburb of Kenmore. He graduated from St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute in Kenmore, before attending the University of Notre Dame. He served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Career Though, for Week 6 of the 1990 the top announcer for a NFL on NBC only, Criqui has always been a featured announcer in the American sports scene and is notable for his longevity. Criqui began with CBS in 1967 before moving to NBC Sports in 1979; he was 'traded' by CBS to NBC for Curt Gowdy. When CBS reacquired the NFL in 1998, Criqui rejoined the network, and continued to serve as a play-by-play announcer as part of the NFL on CBS until his retirement from that position after the 2012 season.Pergament, Alan (August 21, 2013). American Pickers filming here, Criqui out of CBS games . The Buffalo News. Retrieved August 21, 2013. From 1999 to 2004, Criqui and Steve Tasker were the designated play-by- play team for most Buffalo Bills games on CBS. He has also announced a number of other sports for CBS, NBC and ESPN including college football, college basketball, the ABA, the NBA, the NHL, professional golf and tennis tournaments, Triple Crown horse racing, the Canadian Football League () and several Summer Olympics events. During his tenure at NBC, Criqui called 14 Orange Bowl games. Criqui's most memorable call was the 1984 Orange Bowl between undefeated Nebraska and Miami. Nebraska was on a 22-game winning streak coming into the game, but lost to Miami 31-30 when the Cornhuskers failed on a two-point conversion attempt which would have won the game. His most famous college basketball call was most likely the last-second upset by St. Joseph's over top-seeded DePaul in the Mideast regional second round of the 1981 NCAA Tournament. Criqui was the radio play-by-play voice of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football on the Notre Dame IMG Sports Network from 2006-2018, offering such memorable calls as the end of the 2011 Notre Dame- Michigan Wolverines football game in which Criqui audibly showed his disdain for the result as well as a blind optimism that Roy Roundtree did not catch the winning pass. =Other projects= His other projects include hosting radio talk shows about sports, serving as a part-time TV announcer for the New York Mets in 1991, and working as the play-by-play announcer for New England Patriots pre-season telecasts on WCVB-TV, Boston from 1995 to 2008 and for WBZ-TV, Boston from 2009 to 2012. Criqui was also for many years the key spokesperson for Trans World Airlines, appearing as himself in many television, radio and print advertisements as part of the Ogilvy & Mather- produced advertising campaign: \\"You're Gonna Like Us (sm). TWA.\\", which ran between 1978 and 1984 in support of the airline's domestic U.S. marketing efforts. For years, he also served as co-host of the weekend version of the newsmagazine Inside Edition. He also served as a sportscaster on WOR radio in New York on the Rambling with Gambling show, as well as on WNBC radio on Imus in the Morning. =Memorable NFL calls= One of Criqui's memorable NFL calls came on November 8, 1970: Tom Dempsey's 63-yard field goal that lifted the New Orleans Saints to a 19-17 victory over the Detroit Lions at New Orleans' Tulane Stadium. Other memorable NFL games that Criqui took part in were the 1978 \\"Miracle at the Meadowlands\\" and the 1982 \\"Epic in Miami\\". Criqui also did play-by-play of the 1985-86 seasons of Monday Night Football and Super Bowls XX and XXI (alongside Bob Trumpy) for NBC Radio. He also called \\"Red Right 88\\" in 1980, when Brian Sipe threw an interception in the end zone to end the Cleveland Browns' season. He along with Randy Cross called the Detroit Lions' comeback victory over the Browns in 2009. He was presented with the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

Biography A native of Alexandria, Virginia, Dudley majored in chemistry at the University of Virginia. He turned to broadcasting in the late 1930s, starting out at a Charlottesville radio station. He moved up to calling Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox games from 1938-1941 before serving as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Dudley was the Indians' lead announcer from 1948 until his firing by the club in January 1968. In 1969, Dudley broadcast for the expansion Seattle Pilots; when the club moved to Milwaukee and became the Brewers the following year, he did not join them. Dudley broadcast for a number of minor league teams in the 1970s before retiring. As an announcer, Dudley was known for his friendly, homespun style and his signature catchphrases: \\"Hello, baseball fans everywhere\\" (to start a broadcast), \\"The string is out\\" (describing a full count on a hitter), \\"A swing and a miss!-he struck him out\\", \\"That ball is going...going...gone!\\" (to describe a home run) and \\"So long and lots of good luck, you hear?\\" (signing off at the game's end - \\"you hear\\" sounded more like \\"ya he-ah?\\" in Dudley's vocal inflection). Dudley was also a popular advertising pitchman in Cleveland, remembered primarily for his radio and television commercials for the Aluminum Siding Corporation (Garfield 1-2323) and Kahn's Hot Dogs -- \\"the wien-ah the world awaited,\\" in Dudley's unique parlance. Dudley called the 1954 World Series and All-Star Game for the Mutual network, and 1961's first All-Star Game for NBC Radio. In addition to baseball, Dudley also broadcast football at various times for the Ohio State University, the University of Washington, and the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions and Baltimore Colts.

He began broadcasting for the Dodgers in 1959 and was the 1998 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame. One of the most recognizable voices in Hispanic broadcasting, Jarrin, \\"the Spanish Voice of the Dodgers\\" is also heard on Spectrum SportsNet LA's SAP channel. Career Born in Cayambe, Ecuador, Jarrin began work as a broadcaster in his home country when he was just 16 years old. He went on to become the announcer for the National Congress of Ecuador. He came to the United States on June 24, 1955. At the time, he had never seen a baseball game. =Los Angeles Dodgers (1959-present)= When the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, KWKW, where Jarrin was the news and sports director, picked up the Spanish language rights for the games. The original broadcast team included Rene Cardenas, Miguel Alonso and Rodolfo Hoyos Jr. and they were joined by Jarrin in 1959.Teddy Fregoso story at http://laradio.com/ February 16, 2015 For the first six years, they did not travel with the team but would recreate the games on radio while listening to the English-language broadcast in a studio. In 1973, after 14 years with the Dodgers, Jarr√≠n became the club's number-one Spanish-language broadcaster. From 1962 to 1984, Jarr√≠n never missed a game, calling close to 4,000 games over 22 seasons. The streak was broken only when he took charge of all the Spanish-language radio coverage and production for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. During 1980-81, Jarrin, Rene Cardenas, Miguel Alonso and Rodolfo Hoyos Jr. served as interpreter for Mexican pitcher Fernando Valenzuela. Valenzuela would later work as color commentator alongside Jarr√≠n and Pepe Y√±iguez on Dodgers games. He has called more than 30 world championship boxing title bouts throughout the world for radio and television stations in Latin America, including the Thrilla in Manila between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier. He has called 19 All-Star Games and 25 World Series, including the 2005 Fall Classic in which he served as the emcee for MLB's Latin Legends ceremony. His broadcasts of the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and World Series on CBS, the Latina Broadcasting Network, Cadena Latina and Caracol and 1989 to 1999 were carried on more than 300 stations. In March 2006, Jarr√≠n served as a play-by-play announcer for the inaugural World Baseball Classic. In addition to his work calling Dodger games, Jarr√≠n found himself at the center of many international news broadcasts, including the funeral of President John F. Kennedy, Pope John Paul II's visit to America, and several important meetings between foreign leaders and Presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson. For the 2015 season, Jarr√≠n was paired for the first time in the booth with his son Jorge Jarr√≠n. With the retirement of fellow Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully in 2016, Jarrin became the longest tenured active broadcaster in baseball on April 7, 2017. His contract currently runs through the 2020 season. Honors and awards Jarr√≠n speaking in 2008. In 1998, Jarr√≠n received the Ford C. Frick Award from the Baseball Hall of Fame, becoming the second Spanish-language broadcaster to that award, joining Mets and Yankees announcer, Buck Canel. In February 1998, Jarr√≠n was the first recipient of the Southern California Broadcaster Association's President's Award. Also in 1998, he was honored by the National Association of Hispanic Journalists with their highest award, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2002, Jarr√≠n was inducted into the California Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame and in 2003, into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum. He received the 2003 Foreign Language Sports Broadcaster Award from the Southern California Sports Broadcasters and was inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcaster's Hall of Fame. Jarr√≠n was honored again by the SCSB with the foreign-language broadcaster of the year award in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008. In 2009, he was honored by the Society of St. Vincent DePaul for his commitment to changing the lives of at-risk youth in the community. He has also received La Gran Cruz al Merito en El Grado de Comendador (the highest civilian medal) from his native Ecuador in January 1992. In 1990 he was named as one of the top 100 Influential Hispanics in the United States by Hispanic Business Magazine. In 1970, he was the first Latin American to win the Golden Mike Award, which he received again in 1971. In 2000, he spoke at the MLB Rookie Development seminar, which is designed to prepare top minor league prospects for the Major Leagues. In 2011, Jarrin was honored in Los Angeles with the AFTRA Foundation's AFTRA Media and Entertainment Excellence Award in Broadcasting. His colleague, Vin Scully, received the same award in 2009. On June 11, 2012, the Dodgers prior to their game against the Angels honored Jarr√≠n for 54 years of service. He was given a trophy and threw out the first pitch of the game. A video tribute was also made and shown. The fans also received a blue colored T-shirt where the front of the shirt said \\"Se Va, Se Va, Se Va\\" Personal Jarrin studied philosophy, letters, journalism and broadcasting at Central University of Ecuador in Quito.

Biography McDonald was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee. During the early 1930s, he broadcast for the Chattanooga Lookouts, a Minor League Baseball team. In 1932, he won a national contest sponsored by The Sporting News for \\"the most popular sports broadcaster\\", garnering 57,960 votes‚Äîa remarkable achievement, considering that the Lookouts were a Class A team. Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith jumped McDonald straight to broadcasting for the major league team in 1934, and he immediately became a hit. McDonald was one of the first to use \\"ducks on the pond\\" as a term for players on base, and was notable for quoting an old country tune, \\"They Cut Down the Old Pine Tree\\", after a Senators win. He also gave Joe DiMaggio the nickname \\"The Yankee Clipper\\".Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life, Richard Ben Cramer, p. 152. McDonald was best known, however, for his studio re-creations of road games, a common practice in the 1930s, when line charges were too expensive for live road coverage. The radio listeners would hear the click of a ticker tape machine, and the announcer would convey the play; \\"It's a long fly ball to deep center, going, going... gone. It's a home run.\\" For many years, it was common for Senators fans to crowd around McDonald's studio at a drug store on G Street, near the White House, for his recreations. In 1939, McDonald became the first full-time voice of the Yankees and Giants, working the second half of the season alongside a young Mel Allen. In June that year, he helped broadcast activities at the opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, for CBS. However, his homespun style didn't play well in New York, and he was back in Washington for the 1940 season. For the most part, McDonald called losing baseball; the Senators only finished higher than fifth four times during his tenure. Despite the team's losing efforts, McDonald was again named outstanding baseball broadcaster in 1942 and 1945. During the 1940s, he began calling Washington Redskins and college football games. McDonald was forced off Senators broadcasts by a sponsor change following their 1956 season, but remained behind the microphone for the Redskins. =Personal life= McDonald was the Democratic candidate for Maryland's 6th congressional district in the 1946 House of Representatives election, losing to incumbent James Glenn Beall, 58.1% to 41.9%. McDonald died in 1960, of a heart attack at age 59, while returning to Washington, D.C., via train from a Redskins game in New York City. He was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Suitland, Maryland. In 1999, McDonald was posthumously honored with the Ford C. Frick Award, given annually to one baseball broadcaster.

In addition to the three destroyers named USS Henley, there was an additional ship, named which was named after Captain John D. Henley, a brother of Captain Robert Henley. The fourth Henley (DD-762) was launched on 8 April 1945 by Bethlehem Steel Co., San Francisco; sponsored by Mrs. George S. Wheaton; and commissioned on 8 October 1946, Commander Dwight L. Moody in command. History After shakedown in the Pacific, Henley headed east, reporting to the Sonar School at Key West on 19 February 1947 for a five-month tour of duty. She then reported to Norfolk, Virginia from which she sailed 28 July for her first Mediterranean cruise, which terminated on 1 December at Boston. On her second tour in the Mediterranean, Henley patrolled with other United Nations ships in the summer of 1948 as the Israeli-Arab dispute threatened to erupt into war. After a year of tactical training exercises and fleet maneuvers, Henley decommissioned at Charleston, South Carolina on 15 March 1950. Less than six months later, with the outbreak of war in Korea, Henley went back in commission, rejoining the active fleet 23 September. Shakedown over, she sailed July 1951 for another tour with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Henley was detached from this duty and made a cruise to northern European ports, including a journey up the Seine to Rouen, before returning to Norfolk in February 1952. In company with Destroyer Division 221, Henley departed Norfolk on 25 September 1953 for a world cruise which was to take her 44,000 miles in 218 days. During this period, Henley sailed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, participated in the filming of \\"The Bridges of Toko-Ri\\" off the Korean and Japanese coasts, operated with the 7th Fleet in Asian waters, and returned to the States via the Panama Canal and the Caribbean. Following years fell into a pattern for Henley as she alternated Mediterranean cruises with anti-submarine warfare and other tactical exercises off the East Coast and in the Caribbean. In 1959 she joined Task Force 47 for the Inland Seas Cruise to the Great Lakes through the newly completed St. Lawrence Seaway. Nearly 75,000 mid-westerners visited this representative of the \\"salt-water navy\\" in her two-month cruise. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962 over offensive missiles stationed in Cuba, Henley joined the fleet \\"quarantining\\" the island. Following this, she then returned to a peacetime pattern of readiness operations. On 1 October 1964, Henley became a Group I, Naval Reserve training ship assigned to the Anti-Submarine Warfare Component of the Naval Reserve. Following overhaul at Newport News, Virginia, and refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, she began the first of numerous Naval Reserve training cruises out of Norfolk 1 May 1965. Manned by a nucleus crew of 100 officers and men on active duty, she cruised along the Atlantic Coast and into the Caribbean during the next eight years and provided valuable service as an at- sea training platform for hundreds of Naval Reservists. Into mid-1972 she continued this vital duty for officers and men of the Naval Reserve and the Nation and on July 2, 1973, the last all gun Sumner class destroyer remaining in the fleet was decommissioned.

His first assignment was as a curate at St. Gregory Church in Chicago, where he remained until he became chaplain of Mercy Hospital in 1956. From 1959 to 1967 he served as vice- president and general secretary of the Catholic Church Extension Society, becoming president in 1967. He also taught at St. Gregory the Great High School and Loyola University, and served on the archdiocesan marriage tribunal.

He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Cardinal John Cody, with Bishops Cletus F. O'Donnell and Aloysius John Wycislo serving as co-consecrators, at Holy Name Cathedral. In addition to his episcopal duties, he served as pastor of Christ the King Church in Chicago. =Mobile= Following the resignation of Bishop Thomas Joseph Toolen, May was appointed the seventh Bishop of Mobile, Alabama, on September 29, 1969. His installation took place on the following December 10 at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. During his 10-year-long tenure in Mobile, he established eight parishes and two deaneries, dedicated twelve churches, founded two schools, and erected a convent. He also dedicated several other institutions, including parish centers, elderly homes, and a new wing and intensive-care unit at Providence Hospital. May continued to implement the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council, authorizing the laity to distribute Communion, the reception of Communion in the hand, and a new rite for the Sacrament of Penance. He founded an Office of Youth Ministry, Diocesan Pastoral Council, and Diocesan Board of Catholic Education.

As the name suggests, the celebration takes place on a teenager's sixteenth birthday, and is celebrated across all genders. While some families throw large, lavish celebrations, others choose to celebrate the birthday as if it were a normal occurrence. This event can be formal, casual, or semi-formal. While traditionally it is common that sweet sixteens are mostly celebrated by girls they can also be celebrated by boys, who tend to celebrate with their friends on an informal basis. Sweet sixteens can range from modest parties at home with close family to large parties with a hired DJ, makeup, hair styling, expensive gowns and dresses, and hotel ballrooms. Even if it is a small party, the main purpose of the party is to celebrate the person becoming \\"older\\" and entering a different stage of their life. In countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the 16th birthday is eclipsed by a teenager's 18th birthday celebration, the age at which young people become adults and are allowed to vote and legally purchase alcohol. Alternative sweet sixteen celebrations in the United States can include a religious or church ceremony also, like a Mass or a blessing at church. This religious or church ceremony has its origins in the Quincea√±era style, but since there are many American- born Hispanics, many choose to blend a sweet sixteen American style with their Quincea√±era tradition. For example, the girl may go to the church for the religious ceremony and, then, while in the party, choose to have the sixteen- candle ceremony. The religious ceremony comes from the Hispanic tradition, while the sixteen candles ceremony comes from the American tradition. Traditions =Montage= At high end sweet sixteens, a DJ often brings along several televisions or a projector to show a video montage set to music of the birthday girl containing pictures starting from when she was a baby and getting older, usually ending with pictures of her in her sweet sixteen dress. This is either made by the DJ with photos provided from the family of the birthday girl, by the parents, or by a sibling. The guests can either sit down and watch this montage, or it could be playing in the background while the guests dance. =Shoe ceremony= For girls, the shoe ceremony is common at Quincea√±eras and sweet sixteen parties. In this ceremony, the birthday girl sits down in a chair while her father, grandfather, Godfather, Uncle, or brother approaches her with high heels on a decorative pillow. The girl would traditionally be wearing flat shoes, such as slippers, and the father ceremoniously helps her into her new high heels. This is symbolic of the girl transitioning into a woman. =Tiara ceremony= The tiara ceremony is similar to the shoe ceremony, except the mother or a strong female figure approaches with a tiara instead of shoes and places it on her daughter‚Äôs head to symbolize her becoming a woman. Sometimes this is combined with the shoe ceremony so that two people approach the birthday girl, one with a pillow with high heels, and the other with a pillow with a tiara. =Father-daughter dance= The father-daughter dance is a tradition that is also frequently performed at weddings. The girl and her father dance to a slow-jazz or traditional song while everyone sits and watches. This is usually the first song of the night. Sometimes, girls also added a mother- daughter dance as a dedication to her mother. =Candle-lighting ceremony= This tradition is most common in Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, Quinceaneras and sweet sixteens, although in different ages. There are typically 16 candles, each of which are given to special family members and friends by the birthday girl. Usually, when the recipient of the candle is named, a few words are said by the birthday girl in regards to why this person (or people) is special to them, they may tell a short story or fun memory they have shared with that person. Although the birthday girl can decide to give her candles to whomever she chooses, in whichever order she wants, here is the traditional order of candles: - Each of the 16 candles holds a special meaning... *The first candle is for the girl‚Äôs parents. *The second candle is for the siblings. (If there are no siblings, then this candle can represent the grandparents.) *Candles 3, 4, 5 and 6 are for the rest of the family members. *Candles 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are for friends. *Candle 15 is for the girl‚Äôs best friend or friends. *The 16th candle is for the boyfriend or a very close male friend. *Some add a 17th candle which represents good luck =First car= In the United States and Canada, the minimum age to legally drive a car is 16. Sometimes, although rarely, the birthday person is gifted a car as a birthday present. The car can be either purchased new, used, or simply be gifted from one person to another (often within their family). Other specific coming of age parties =Latin America= Similar celebrations are found in different cultures around the world, such as the quincea√±era in Hispanic countries and the festa de debutantes in Brazil, both at 15 years of age. =Philippines= In the Philippines, the debut (pronounced 'de-boo) celebrates a young woman's 18th birthday. A young man may also celebrate his own debut on his 21st birthday, albeit with less formal celebrations or none at all, . =Judaism= In Conservative, and Orthodox Judaism, girls reach the age of spiritual maturity at the age of 12, celebrated with a bat mitzvah, and for boys (and girls, in the Reform movement) at the age of 13, with a bar mitzvah, or for both, with a B'nai mitzvah and both girls, with a b'not mitzvah. These are important dates in the Jewish culture, because following these ceremonies, bar or bat mitzvah, the young person is considered an adult. =Christianity= In many Christian denominations, both girls and boys reach the age spiritual maturity at around the age of 13 or 14, with the Sacrament of Confirmation.

His influence was such that he had Taoism established as the official state religion of the Northern Wei dynasty (386‚Äì534); this act, however, embroiled Taoism in long and often bloody factional political struggles. There was a saying Kou Qianzhi once secluded in Mount Huashan for his Taoism meditation.  Life  Kou apparently began his career as a Taoist physician and hygienist. But in 415 he had a vision: a spirit appeared before him and told him that since the death of Zhang Daoling, the great founder of the Way of the Celestial Master (\\"Tradition of the Celestial Master of the Mighty Commonwealth of Orthodox Oneness\\") sect of Taoism, the sect had been corrupted by false doctrines. Kou was awarded Zhang Daoling's old title of tianshi (\\"celestial master\\") and was charged in the vision with eliminating excesses in Taoist rituals. Accordingly, Kou began to attempt to curb the orgiastic practices and mercenary spirit that had become associated with Taoist rites and to place greater emphasis on hygienic ritual and good works. Kou gained many adherents and, by making Taoism into a more orthodox doctrine, attracted the attention of Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei. In 423 Kou had the title of tianshi conferred upon himself by Imperial decree, thereby establishing the \\"Taoist papacy\\": the title was passed to the church's leader from generation to generation in an unbroken line. By conspiring with certain court officials, Kou's patron Cui Hao was able to have Buddhism, Taoism's chief competitor, proscribed from the realm and all its practitioners subjected to a bloody persecution. Taoism then became the official religion of the Northern Wei Dynasty. But Kou's efforts were only temporarily effective: Buddhism soon returned to north China, after the deaths of Cui Hao and Emperor Taiwu and the accession of Taiwu's devoutly Buddhist grandson Emperor Wencheng. Moreover, because orgiastic Taoist rites were still noted as late as the Tang dynasty, many observers view his reforms as transitory. Kou Qianzhi was the leader of the Celestial Masters north branch. Celestial Masters north branch under Kou Qianzhi worshipped divinities described in the È≠èÊõ∏ Book of Wei. Yin Xi and the Elder Lord are abesnt from the Celestial Masters of Kou Qianzhi. An anti Buddhist plan was concocted by the Celestial Masters under Kou Qianzhi along with Cui Hao under the Taiwu Emperor. The Celestial Masters of the north urged the persecution of Buddhists under the Taiwu Emperor in the Northern Wei, attacking Buddhism and the Buddha as wicked and as anti stability and anti family. Anti Buddhism was the position of Kou Qianzhi. There was no ban on the Celestial Masters despite the nofullfilment of Cui Hao and Kou Qianzhi's agenda in their anti Buddhist campaign.

For example, in response to a request for police reports relating to a certain individual, the police agency may respond with the following: \\"We can neither confirm nor deny that our agency has any records matching your request.\\" In national or subnational freedom of information policies, governments are often required to tell people who request information (e.g. journalists or attorneys) whether they located the requested records, even if the records end up being kept secret. But at times, a government may determine that the mere act of truthfully disclosing that the records do or do not exist would pose some actual or possible harm, such as to national security, the integrity of an ongoing investigation or a person's privacy. For example, disclosing that a police department has documents about a current investigation into a criminal conspiracy, even if the content of the documents is not disclosed, would make it public that the investigation is happening and could help suspects destroy evidence. Glomar responses are commonly associated with the United States Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which generally dictates how federal agencies must disclose information. The term \\"Glomar\\" originated in association with the FOIA law. Lower courts have thus far ruled the Glomar response to have potential merit if the secretive nature of the material truly requires it, and only if the agency provides \\"as much information as possible\\" to justify its claim. Otherwise, the principles established in FOIA may outweigh claims to secrecy. Origin of the term The phrase itself, \\"neither confirm nor deny\\", has long appeared frequently in news reports, as an alternative to a \\"no comment\\" response when the respondent does not wish to answer. In 1911, for example, the Boston and Maine Railroad told the Boston Globe it would \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" reports about its future plans. In 1916, Ford representatives said they would \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" that price cuts were in the offing for its popular Model-T automobile. When the governor of Kansas was questioned in 1920 about a report addressing a state official's potential ouster, he responded that he would \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" the report's existence. As a \\"Glomar\\" response Hughes Glomar Explorer The USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer was a large salvage vessel built by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for its covert \\"Project Azorian\\"‚Äîan attempted salvaging of a sunken Soviet submarine. In February 1975, aware of the pending publication of a story in the Los Angeles Times, the CIA sought to stop the story's publication. Journalist Harriet Ann Phillippi requested that the CIA provide disclosure of both the Glomar project and its attempts to censor the story, to which the CIA chose to \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" both the project's existence and its attempts to keep the story unpublished. This claim stood, and Phillippi's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request was rejected, though when the Ford administration was replaced by the Carter administration in 1977 after the 1976 presidential election, the government position on the particular case was softened and both of Phillippi's claims were confirmed. The \\"Glomar response\\" precedent still stood, and has since had bearing in FOIA cases such as in the 2004 lawsuit American Civil Liberties Union v. Department of Defense, wherein Federal Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected the Department of Defense and CIA's use of the Glomar response in refusing to release documents and photos depicting abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. \\"Glomar\\" is the syllabic abbreviation of Global Marine, the company commissioned by the CIA to build the Glomar Explorer. According to a Radiolab podcast, the original text of the Glomar response was written by Walt Logan (pseudonym), who was at that time an Associate General Counsel at the CIA. So as not to divulge to the Soviet Union either what the CIA knew or did not know, the response read: > We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information requested > but, hypothetically, if such data were to exist, the subject matter would be > classified, and could not be disclosed.

During his lifetime, he saw his son Liu Hu (ÂäâÁ•ú) become emperor (as Emperor An) as successor to his nephew Emperor Shang, who died in infancy.  Family background  Liu Qing was born to Emperor Zhang and Consort Song, then one of Emperor Zhang's favorites and also a favorite of Emperor Zhang's mother Empress Dowager Ma, in 78. As Emperor Zhang's wife Empress Dou was sonless, Prince Qing was created crown prince in 79, while still in infancy.  Tragedy in childhood  Empress Dou was not satisfied with the situation, however, and in 79, after another imperial consort, Consort Liang, gave birth to a son named Liu Zhao (ÂäâËÇá), she adopted Prince Zhao and intended to make him crown prince instead. After Empress Dowager Ma died later that year, Consort Song was left without anyone to protect her, and Empress Dou began to plot her destruction. In 82, an opportunity came for Empress Dou. Consort Song had become ill, and in her illness, she craved raw cuscuta, and she requested that her family bring them. Empress Dou seized the cuscuta and falsely accused Consort Song of using it for witchcraft. Emperor Zhang was enraged and expelled Crown Prince Qing from the palace. He had Consort Song and her sister, also an imperial consort, arrested and interrogated by the eunuch Cai Lun. Consort Song and her sister saw that they were in deep straits, and they committed suicide by poison. Crown Prince Qing was deposed and created the Prince of Qinghe instead; he was replaced by Prince Zhao as crown prince. Prince Zhao, however, was friendly to his brother, and they often spent time together. In 88, Emperor Zhang died, and Crown Prince Zhao succeeded to the throne as Emperor He. The still-young Prince Qing remained in the capital Luoyang, and he and his emperor brother continued to spend great amounts of time together.  As advisor to his brother  During the first part of Emperor He's reign, the clan of Empress Dowager Dou, particularly her brother Dou Xian, dominated the political scene. That trend continued even as Emperor He grew older and older. Dissatisfied with the autocratic authorities of Dou Xian, Emperor He pondered his options. Apparently encouraged by Prince Qing and the eunuch Zheng Zhong, Emperor He carried out a coup d'√©tat in 92 and toppled the Dous' power. (Prince Qing's involvement in the plot is not completely clear but apparently major, and it is speculated that his motivation was to avenge himself (for being deposed) and his mother (for being forced to commit suicide).)Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 13. After Empress Dowager Dou died in 97, it finally became revealed that Emperor He was born of Consort Liang. Only at that time did Prince Qing dare to request his brother to allow him to rebury his own mother Consort Song. Emperor He agreed and further ordered that Prince Qing be supplied with the proper items to worship his mother posthumously. For the rest of Emperor He's reign, Prince Qing remained in the capital and was a close advisor of Emperor He.  After Emperor He's death  When Emperor He died in 106, Prince Qing was so saddened by his brother's death that he vomited blood and became seriously ill. While he would recover, his health would be poor for the rest of his life. The fact that he was required to report to his Principality of Qinghe (in modern central Hebei) after his brother's death probably did not help. However, Emperor He's wife Empress Dowager Deng Sui, because Emperor He's son Emperor Shang was still an infant, ordered that Prince Qing's wife Consort Geng and his son Liu Hu (by his concubine Consort Zuo Xiao'e (Â∑¶Â∞èÂ®•)) remain in the capital to serve as a potential successor. When Emperor Shang died later in 106, instead of making Emperor Shang's older brother Liu Sheng (ÂäâÂãù) the Prince of Pingyuan emperor, Empress Deng made Prince Hu emperor, as Emperor An, due to her concerns that Prince Sheng would bear a grudge for not having been selected first. Empress Deng sent Consort Geng to Qinghe to join Prince Qing and dominated the government, and there was no sign that Prince Qing had significant input into his son's early reign. Late in 106, Prince Qing died, and at his request was buried next to his mother Consort Song. Later, after Empress Dowager Deng's death in 121, Emperor An posthumously honored him as Emperor Xiaode.

Snowdrifts resemble sand dunes and are formed in a similar manner, namely, by wind moving light snow and depositing it when the wind has virtually stopped, usually against a stationary object. Snow normally crests and slopes off toward the surface on the windward side of a large object. On the leeward side, areas near the object are a bit lower than surrounding areas, but are generally flatter. The impact of snowdrifts on transportation can be more significant than the snowfall itself, such as in the USA during the Great Blizzard of 1978. Snowdrifts are many times found at or on roads, as the crest of the roadbed or the furrows along the road create the disruption to the wind needed to shed its carried snow. Snow fences may be employed on the windward side of the road to intentionally create a drift before the snow-laden wind reaches the road.

Purportedly born in Northwest Territories, Canada, he later published autobiographical children's books under the name Sat-Okh. These were translated into several European languages. He claimed to be Polish-Shawnee and to have grown up in Canada among First Nations people. His mother was Polish and returned with him to Poland before World War II. In the postwar years, he became an important figure in the Polish \\"indianist\\" movement. There has been considerable controversy as to whether his accounts were a hoax, as his books reflect culture and customs not associated with the peoples of the Northwest Territories. Early life Stanis≈Çaw Sup≈Çatowicz claimed to be born in Canada about 1922 as the a son of a Polish mother, Stanislawa Okulska, and a Shawnee father. Poland was within the sphere of the Russian Empire; after the Russian Revolution, Okulska was exiled to Siberia. She escaped to the east, making her way to Canada. There she was taken in by Native Americans, marrying a Shawnee man, and bringing up their three children among his people. The third child was Stanis≈Çaw Sup≈Çatowicz. In the late 1930s Sat-Okh and his mother moved to Poland. Because Sup≈Çatowicz, as a Native American, did not have a Canadian citizenship, he had to create a birth certificate to gain the Polish one. In order to do it, his mother changed some of his data to hide his Native American ancestry. Military career In 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Sup≈Çatowicz joined the Polish resistance movement. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1940 and deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. He escaped from the train transport on the way to the camp. Sup≈Çatowicz joined the Home Army in Poland, where he gained a nickname Kozak because of his bravery and fighting style based on making traps.

Warfare occurred throughout the history of Ancient Greece, from the Greek Dark Ages onward. The Greek 'Dark Age' drew to a close as a significant increase in population allowed urbanized culture to be restored, which led to the rise of the city-states (Poleis). These developments ushered in the period of Archaic Greece (800-480 BC). They also restored the capability of organized warfare between these Poleis (as opposed to small-scale raids to acquire livestock and grain, for example). The fractious nature of Ancient Greek society seems to have made continuous conflict on this larger scale inevitable. Along with the rise of the city- states evolved a new style of warfare: the hoplite phalanx. Hoplites were armored infantrymen, armed with spears and shields, and the phalanx was a formation of these soldiers with their shields locked together and spears pointed forward. The Chigi vase, dated to around 650 BC, is the earliest depiction of a hoplite in full battle array. With this evolution in warfare, battles seem to have consisted mostly of the clash of hoplite phalanxes from the city-states in conflict. Since the soldiers were citizens with other occupations, warfare was limited in distance, season and scale. Neither side could afford heavy casualties or sustained campaigns, so conflicts seem to have been resolved by a single set-piece battle. The scale and scope of warfare in Ancient Greece changed dramatically as a result of the Greco- Persian Wars, which marked the beginning of Classical Greece (480-323 BC). To fight the enormous armies of the Achaemenid Empire was effectively beyond the capabilities of a single city-state. The eventual triumph of the Greeks was achieved by alliances of many city-states, on a scale never seen before. The rise of Athens and Sparta during this conflict led directly to the Peloponnesian War, which saw diversification of warfare. Emphasis shifted to naval battles and strategies of attrition such as blockades and sieges. Following the defeat of the Athenians in 404 BC, and the disbandment of the Athenian-dominated Delian League, Ancient Greece fell under the Spartan hegemony. But this was unstable, and the Persian Empire sponsored a rebellion by the combined powers of Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos, resulting in the Corinthian War (395-387 BC). Persia switched sides, which ended the war, in return for the cities of Ionia and Spartan non-interference in Asia Minor. The Spartan hegemony would last another 16 years, until, at the Battle of Leuctra (371) the Spartans were decisively defeated by the Theban general Epaminondas. The Thebans acted with alacrity to establish a hegemony of their own over Greece. However, Thebes lacked sufficient manpower and resources, and became overstretched. Following the death of Epaminondas and loss of manpower at the Battle of Mantinea, the Theban hegemony ceased. The losses in the ten years of the Theban hegemony left all the Greek city-states weakened and divided. The city-states of southern Greece were too weak to resist the rise of the Macedonian kingdom in the north. With revolutionary tactics, King Phillip II brought most of Greece under his sway, paving the way for the conquest of \\"the known world\\" by his son Alexander the Great. The rise of the Macedonian Kingdom is generally taken to signal the beginning of the Hellenistic period, and certainly marked the end of the distinctive hoplite battle in Ancient Greece.  Military structure and methods in ancient Greece  = Hoplite = A hoplite armed with an alt= Along with the rise of the city-state evolved a brand new style of warfare and the emergence of the hoplite. The hoplite was an infantryman, the central element of warfare in Ancient Greece. The word hoplite (Greek ·ΩÅœÄŒªŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ, hoplitƒìs) derives from hoplon (·ΩÖœÄŒªŒøŒΩ, plural hopla, ·ΩÖœÄŒªŒ±) meaning a large, round shield, as they were named after their most notable gear. Hoplites were the citizen-soldiers of the Ancient Greek City- states (except Spartans who were professional soldiers). They were primarily armed as spear-men and fought in a phalanx (see below). Hoplite armor was extremely expensive for the average citizen, so it was commonly passed down from the soldier's father or relative. Alexander‚Äôs Macedonian army had spears called sarissas that were 18 feet long, far longer than the 6‚Äì9 foot Greek dory. The secondary weapon of a hoplite was the xiphos, a short sword used when the soldier's spear was broken or lost while fighting. The origins of the hoplite are obscure, and no small matter of contention amongst historians. Traditionally, this has been dated to the 8th century BC, and attributed to Sparta; but more recent views suggest a later date, towards the 7th century BC . Certainly, by approximately 650 BC, as dated by the 'Chigi vase', the 'hoplite revolution' was complete. The major innovation in the development of the hoplite seems to have been the characteristic circular shield (Aspis), roughly in diameter, and made of wood faced with bronze. Although very heavy (), the design of this shield was such that it could be supported on the shoulder. More importantly, it permitted the formation of a shield-wall by an army, an impenetrable mass of men and shields. Men were also equipped with metal greaves and also a breastplate made of bronze, leather, or stiff cloth. When this was combined with the primary weapon of the hoplite, long spear (the doru), it gave both offensive and defensive capabilities. Regardless of where it developed, the model for the hoplite army evidently quickly spread throughout Greece. The persuasive qualities of the phalanx were probably its relative simplicity (allowing its use by a citizen militia), low fatality rate (important for small city-states), and relatively low cost (enough for each hoplite to provide his own equipment). The Phalanx also became a source of political influence because men had to provide their own equipment to be a part of the army. The hoplite phalanx Reconstruction of a Hoplite Phalanx formation The ancient Greek city-states developed a military formation called the phalanx, which were rows of shoulder-to-shoulder hoplites. The Hoplites would lock their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their spears out over the first rank of shields. The Phalanx therefore presented a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults much more difficult. It also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the front rank). The phalanx formed the core of ancient Greek militaries. Because hoplites were all protected by their own shield and others‚Äô shields and spears, they were relatively safe as long as the formation didn't break. When advancing towards an enemy, the phalanx would break into a run that was sufficient to create momentum but not too much as to lose cohesion. The opposing sides would collide viciously, possibly terrifying many of the hoplites of the front row. The battle would then rely on the valour of the men in the front line, while those in the rear maintained forward pressure on the front ranks with their shields. When in combat, the whole formation would consistently press forward trying to break the enemy formation; thus, when two phalanx formations engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match, in which, as a rule, the deeper phalanx would almost always win, with few recorded exceptions. When exactly the phalanx developed is uncertain, but it is thought to have been developed by the Argives in their early clashes with the Spartans. The chigi vase, dated to around 650 BC, is the earliest depiction of a hoplite in full battle array. The hoplite was a well-armed and armored citizen-soldier primarily drawn from the middle classes. Every man had to serve at least two years in the army. Fighting in the tight phalanx formation maximised the effectiveness of his armor, large shield and long spear, presenting a wall of armor and spearpoints to the enemy. They were a force to be reckoned with. = Hoplite warfare = An Ancient Greek warrior, Riace bronzes, c. 450 BC At least in the Archaic Period, the fragmentary nature of Ancient Greece, with many competing city- states, increased the frequency of conflict, but conversely limited the scale of warfare. Unable to maintain professional armies, the city-states relied on their citizens to fight. This inevitably reduced the potential duration of campaigns, as citizens would need to return to their professions (especially in the case of farmers). Campaigns would therefore often be restricted to summer. Armies marched directly to their target, possibly agreed on by the protagonists. Sparta was an exception to this rule, as every Spartiate was a professional soldier. Spartans instead relied on slaves called helots for civilian jobs such as farming. If battle was refused by one side, it would retreat to the city, in which case the attackers generally had to content themselves with ravaging the countryside around, since the campaign season was too limited to attempt a siege. When battles occurred, they were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. These battles were short, bloody, and brutal, and thus required a high degree of discipline. At least in the early classical period, hoplites were the primary force; light troops and cavalry generally protected the flanks and performed skirmishing, acting as support troops for the core heavy infantry. The strength of hoplites was shock combat. The two phalanxes would smash into each other in hopes of quickly breaking the enemy force's line. Failing that, a battle degenerated into a pushing match, with the men in the rear trying to force the front lines through those of the enemy. This maneuver was known as the Othismos or \\"push.\\" Thucydides described hoplite warfare as othismos aspidon or \\"the push of shields\\". Battles rarely lasted more than an hour. Once one of the lines broke, the troops would generally flee from the field, chased by peltasts or light cavalry if available. If a hoplite escaped, he would sometimes be forced to drop his cumbersome aspis, thereby disgracing himself to his friends and family. Casualties were slight compared to later battles, amounting to anywhere between 5 and 15% for the winning and losing sides respectively, but the slain often included the most prominent citizens and generals who led from the front. Thus, the whole war could be decided by a single field battle; victory was enforced by ransoming the fallen back to the defeated, called the 'Custom of the Dead Greeks'.. = Other elements of Greek armies = Greek armies also included significant numbers of light infantry, the Psiloi, as support troops for the heavy hoplites, who also doubled as baggage handlers for the heavy foot. These included javelin throwers (akontistai), stone throwers (lithovoloi) and slingers (sfendonitai) while archers (toxotai) were rare, mainly from Crete, or mercenary non-Greek tribes (as at the crucial battle of Plataea 479 B.C.) Greek armies gradually downgraded the armor of the hoplites (to linen padded thorax and open helmets) to make the phalanx more flexible and upgraded the javelineers to lightly armored general purpose infantry (thorakitai and thyreophoroi) with javelins and sometimes spears. Eventually, these types effectively complemented the Macedonian style phalanx which prevailed throughout Greece after Alexander the Great. Cavalry had always existed in Greek armies of the classical era but the cost of horses made it far more expensive than hoplite armor, limiting cavalrymen to nobles and the very wealthy (social class of hippeis). During the early hoplite era cavalry played almost no role whatsoever, mainly for social, but also tactical reasons, since the middle-class phalanx completely dominated the battlefield. Gradually, and especially during the Peloponnesian war, cavalry became more important acquiring every role that cavalry could play, except perhaps frontal attack. It scouted, screened, harassed, outflanked and pursued with the most telling moment being the use of Syracusan horse to harass and eventually destroy the retreating Athenian army of the disastrous Sicilian expedition 415-413 B.C. One of the most famous troop of Greek cavalry was the Tarantine cavalry, originating from the city-state of Taras in Magna Graecia.  The economics of ancient warfare  Campaigns were often timed with the agricultural season to impact the enemies or enemies' crops and harvest. The timing had to be very carefully arranged so that the invaders' enemy's harvest would be disrupted but the invaders' harvest would not be affected. Late invasions were also possible in the hopes that the sowing season would be affected but this at best would have minimal effects on the harvest. One alternative to disrupting the harvest was to ravage the countryside by uprooting trees, burning houses and crops and killing all who were not safe behind the walls of the city. Uprooting trees was especially effective given the Greek reliance on the olive crop and the long time it takes new olive trees to reach maturity. Ravaging the countryside took much effort and depended on the season because green crops do not burn as well as those nearer to harvest. War also led to acquisition of land and slaves which would lead to a greater harvest, which could support a larger army. Plunder was also a large part of war and this allowed for pressure to be taken off of the government finances and allowed for investments to be made that would strengthen the polis. War also stimulated production because of the sudden increase in demand for weapons and armor. Shipbuilders would also experience sudden increases in their production demands.  Ancient Greek military campaigns  = The Greco-Persian Wars = The scale and scope of warfare in Ancient Greece changed dramatically as a result of the Greco-Persian Wars. To fight the enormous armies of the Achaemenid Empire was effectively beyond the capabilities of a single city-state. The eventual triumph of the Greeks was achieved by alliances of many city-states (the exact composition changing over time), allowing the pooling of resources and division of labour. Although alliances between city states occurred before this time, nothing on this scale had been seen before. The Greco-Persian Wars (499-448 BC) were the result of attempts by the Persian Emperor Darius the Great, and then his successor Xerxes I to subjugate Ancient Greece. Darius was already ruler of the cities of Ionia, and the wars are taken to start when they rebelled in 499 BC. The revolt was crushed by 494 BC, but Darius resolved to bring mainland Greece under his dominion. Many city-states made their submission to him, but others did not, notably including Athens and Sparta. Darius thus sent his commanders Datis and Artaphernes to attack Attica, to punish Athens for her intransigence. After burning Eretria, the Persians landed at Marathon. An Athenian army of c. 10,000 hoplites marched to meet the Persian army of about 25,000 troops. The Athenians were at a significant disadvantage both strategically and tactically. Raising such a large army had denuded Athens of defenders, and thus any attack in the Athenian rear would cut off the Army from the City. Tactically, the hoplites were very vulnerable to attacks by cavalry, and the Athenians had no cavalry to defend the flanks. After several days of stalemate at Marathon, the Persian commanders attempted to take strategic advantage by sending their cavalry (by ship) to raid Athens itself. This gave the Athenian army a small window of opportunity to attack the remainder of the Persian Army. alt=Early interpretation of the Greek Double Envelopment with Greek wings (blue) enveloping the Persians (red) This was the first true engagement between a hoplite army and a non-Greek army. The Persians had acquired a reputation for invincibility, but the Athenian hoplites proved crushingly superior in the ensuing infantry battle. To counter the massive numbers of Persians, the Greek general Miltiades ordered the troops to be spread across an unusually wide front, leaving the centre of the Greek line undermanned. However, the lightly armored Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armored hoplites, and the Persian wings were quickly routed. The Greek wings then turned against the elite troops in the Persian centre, which had held the Greek centre until then. Marathon demonstrated to the Greeks the lethal potential of the hoplite, and firmly demonstrated that the Persians were not, after all, invincible. The revenge of the Persians was postponed 10 years by internal conflicts in the Persian Empire, until Darius's son Xerxes returned to Greece in 480 BC with a staggeringly large army (modern estimates suggest between 150,000-250,000 men). Many Greeks city-states, having had plenty of warning of the forthcoming invasion, formed an anti- Persian league; though as before, other city-states remained neutral or allied with Persia. Although alliances between city-states were commonplace, the scale of this league was a novelty, and the first time that the Greeks had united in such a way to face an external threat. This allowed diversification of the allied armed forces, rather than simply mustering a very large hoplite army. The visionary Athenian politician Themistocles had successfully persuaded his fellow citizens to build a huge fleet in 483/82 BC to combat the Persian threat (and thus to effectively abandon their hoplite army, since there were not men enough for both). Amongst the allies therefore, Athens was able to form the core of a navy, whilst other cities, including Sparta, provided the army. This alliance thus removed the constraints on the type of armed forces that the Greeks could use. The use of such a large navy was also a novelty to the Greeks. The second Persian invasion is famous for the battles of Thermopylae and Salamis. As the massive Persian army moved south through Greece, the allies sent a small holding force (c. 10,000) men under the Spartan king Leonidas, to block the pass of Thermopylae whilst the main allied army could be assembled. The allied navy extended this blockade at sea, blocking the nearby straits of Artemisium, to prevent the huge Persian navy landing troops in Leonidas's rear. Famously, Leonidas's men held the much larger Persian army at the pass (where their numbers were less of an advantage) for three days, the hoplites again proving their superiority. Only when a Persian force managed to outflank them by means of a mountain track was the allied army overcome; but by then Leonidas had dismissed the majority of the troops, remaining with a rearguard of 300 Spartans (and perhaps 2000 other troops), in the process making one of history's great last stands. The Greek navy, despite their lack of experience, also proved their worth holding back the Persian fleet whilst the army still held the pass. Thermopylae provided the Greeks with time to arrange their defences, and they dug in across the Isthmus of Corinth, an impregnable position; although an evacuated Athens was thereby sacrificed to the advancing Persians. In order to outflank the isthmus, Xerxes needed to use this fleet, and in turn therefore needed to defeat the Greek fleet; similarly, the Greeks needed to neutralise the Persian fleet to ensure their safety. To this end, the Greeks were able to lure the Persian fleet into the straits of Salamis; and, in a battleground where Persian numbers again counted for nothing, they won a decisive victory, justifying Themistocles' decision to build the Athenian fleet. Demoralised, Xerxes returned to Asia Minor with much of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to campaign in Greece the following year (479 BC). However, a united Greek army of c. 40,000 hoplites decisively defeated Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea, effectively ending the invasion. Almost simultaneously, the allied fleet defeated the remnants of the Persian navy at Mycale, thus destroying the Persian hold on the islands of the Aegean. The remainder of the wars saw the Greeks take the fight to the Persians. The Athenian dominated Delian League of cities and islands extirpated Persian garrisons from Macedon and Thrace, before eventually freeing the Ionian cities from Persian rule. At one point, the Greeks even attempted an invasion of Cyprus and Egypt (which proved disastrous), demonstrating a major legacy of the Persian Wars: warfare in Greece had moved beyond the seasonal squabbles between city-states, to coordinated international actions involving huge armies. After the war, ambitions of many Greek states dramatically increased. Tensions resulting from this, and the rise of Athens and Sparta as pre-eminent powers during the war led directly to the Peloponnesian War, which saw further development of the nature of warfare, strategy and tactics. = The Peloponnesian War = The key actions of each phase pelte hand as additional ammunition The Peloponnesian War (431-404 BC), was fought between the Athenian dominated Delian League and the Spartan dominated Peloponnesian League. The increased manpower and financial resources increased the scale, and allowed the diversification of warfare. Set-piece battles during this war proved indecisive and instead there was increased reliance on naval warfare, and strategies of attrition such as blockades and sieges. These changes greatly increased the number of casualties and the disruption of Greek society. Whatever the proximal causes of the war, it was in essence a conflict between Athens and Sparta for supremacy in Greece. The war (or wars, since it is often divided into three periods) was for much of the time a stalemate, punctuated with occasional bouts of activity. Tactically the Peloponnesian war represents something of a stagnation; the strategic elements were most important as the two sides tried to break the deadlock, something of a novelty in Greek warfare. Building on the experience of the Persian Wars, the diversification from core hoplite warfare, permitted by increased resources, continued. There was increased emphasis on navies, sieges, mercenaries and economic warfare. Far from the previously limited and formalized form of conflict, the Peloponnesian War transformed into an all-out struggle between city-states, complete with atrocities on a large scale; shattering religious and cultural taboos, devastating vast swathes of countryside and destroying whole cities. From the start, the mismatch in the opposing forces was clear. The Delian League (hereafter 'Athenians') were primarily a naval power, whereas the Peloponnesian League (hereafter 'Spartans') consisted of primarily land-based powers. The Athenians thus avoided battle on land, since they could not possibly win, and instead dominated the sea, blockading the Peloponnesus whilst maintaining their trade. Conversely, the Spartans repeatedly invaded Attica, but only for a few weeks at a time; they remained wedded to the idea of hoplite-as-citizen. Although both sides suffered setbacks and victories, the first phase essentially ended in stalemate, as neither league had the power to neutralise the other. The second phase, an Athenian expedition to attack Syracuse in Sicily achieved no tangible result other than a large loss of Athenian ships and men. In the third phase of the war however the use of more sophisticated stratagems eventually allowed the Spartans to force Athens to surrender. Firstly, the Spartans permanently garrisoned a part of Attica, removing from Athenian control the silver mine which funded the war effort. Forced to squeeze even more money from her allies, the Athenian league thus became heavily strained. After the loss of Athenian ships and men in the Sicilian expedition, Sparta was able to foment rebellion amongst the Athenian league, which therefore massively reduced the ability of the Athenians to continue the war. Athens in fact partially recovered from this setback between 410-406 BC, but a further act of economic war finally forced her defeat. Having developed a navy that was capable of taking on the much-weakened Athenian navy, the Spartan general Lysander seized the Hellespont, the source of Athens' grain. The remaining Athenian fleet was thereby forced to confront the Spartans, and were decisively defeated. Athens had little choice but to surrender; and was stripped of her city walls, overseas possessions and navy. In the aftermath, the Spartans were able to establish themselves as the dominant force in Greece for three decades.  Mercenaries and light infantry  Although tactically there was little innovation in the Peloponessian War, there does appear to have been an increase in the use of light infantry, such as peltasts (javelin throwers) and archers. Many of these would have been mercenary troops, hired from outlying regions of Greece. For instance, the Agrianes from Thrace were well-renowned peltasts, whilst Crete was famous for its archers. Since there were no decisive land-battles in the Peloponnesian War, the presence or absence of these troops was unlikely to have affected the course of the war. Nevertheless, it was an important innovation, one which was developed much further in later conflicts. Sileraioi were also a group of ancient mercenaries most likely employed by the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse = Spartan & Theban hegemonies = Following the eventual defeat of the Athenians in 404 BC, and the disbandment of the Athenian-dominated Delian League, Ancient Greece fell under the hegemony of Sparta. The peace treaty which ended the Peloponnesian War left Sparta as the de facto ruler of Greece (hegemon). Although the Spartans did not attempt to rule all of Greece directly, they prevented alliances of other Greek cities, and forced the city-states to accept governments deemed suitable by Sparta. However, from the very beginning, it was clear that the Spartan hegemony was shaky; the Athenians, despite their crushing defeat, restored their democracy but just one year later, ejecting the Sparta-approved oligarchy. The Spartans did not feel strong enough to impose their will on a shattered Athens. Undoubtedly part of the reason for the weakness of the hegemony was a decline in the Spartan population. This did not go unnoticed by the Persian Empire, which sponsored a rebellion by the combined powers of Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos, resulting in the Corinthian War (395-387 BC). This was the first major challenge Sparta faced. The early encounters, at Nemea and Coronea were typical engagements of hoplite phalanxes, resulting in Spartan victories. However, the Spartans suffered a large setback when their fleet was wiped out by a Persian Fleet at the Battle of Cnidus, undermining the Spartan presence in Ionia. The war petered out after 394 BC, with a stalemate punctuated with minor engagements. One of these is particularly notable however; at the Battle of Lechaeum, an Athenian force composed mostly of light troops (e.g. peltasts) defeated a Spartan regiment... The Athenian general Iphicrates had his troops make repeated hit and run attacks on the Spartans, who, having neither peltasts nor cavalry, could not respond effectively. The defeat of a hoplite army in this way demonstrates the changes in both troops and tactic which had occurred in Greek Warfare. The war ended when the Persians, worried by the allies' successes, switched to supporting the Spartans, in return for the cities of Ionia and Spartan non-interference in Asia Minor. This brought the rebels to terms, and restored the Spartan hegemony on a more stable footing. The peace treaty which ended the war, effectively restored the status quo ante bellum, although Athens was permitted to retain some of the territory it had regained during the war. The Spartan hegemony would last another 16 years... The Battle of Leuctra, 371 BC, showing Epaminondas's tactical advances The second major challenge Sparta faced was fatal to its hegemony, and even to its position as a first-rate power in Greece. As the Thebans attempted to expand their influence over Boeotia, they inevitably incurred the ire of Sparta. After they refused to disband their army, an army of approximately 10,000 Spartans and Pelopennesians marched north to challenge the Thebans. At the decisive Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), the Thebans routed the allied army. The battle is famous for the tactical innovations of the Theban general Epaminondas. Defying convention, he strengthened the left flank of the phalanx to an unheard of depth of 50 ranks, at the expense of the centre and the right. The centre and right were staggered backwards from the left (an 'echelon' formation), so that the phalanx advanced obliquely. The Theban left wing was thus able to crush the elite Spartan forces on the allied right, whilst the Theban centre and left avoided engagement; after the defeat of the Spartans and the death of the Spartan king, the rest of the allied army routed. This is one of the first known examples of both the tactic of local concentration of force, and the tactic of 'refusing a flank'. Following this victory, the Thebans first secured their power-base in Boeotia, before marching on Sparta. As the Thebans were joined by many erstwhile Spartan allies, the Spartans were powerless to resist this invasion. The Thebans marched into Messenia, and freed it from Sparta; this was a fatal blow to Sparta, since Messenia had provided most of the helots which supported the Spartan warrior society. These events permanently reduced Spartan power and prestige, and replaced the Spartan hegemony with a Theban one. The Theban hegemony would be short-lived however. Opposition to it throughout the period 369-362 BC caused numerous clashes. In an attempt to bolster the Thebans' position, Epaminondas again marched on the Pelopennese in 362 BC. At the Battle of Mantinea, the largest battle ever fought between the Greek city- states occurred; most states were represented on one side or the other. Epaminondas deployed tactics similar to those at Leuctra, and again the Thebans, positioned on the left, routed the Spartans, and thereby won the battle. However, such were the losses of Theban manpower, including Epaminondas himself, that Thebes was thereafter unable to sustain its hegemony. Conversely, another defeat and loss of prestige meant that Sparta was unable to regain its primary position in Greece. Ultimately, Mantinea, and the preceding decade, severely weakened many Greek states, and left them divided and without the leadership of a dominant power. = The rise of Macedon and the end of the hoplite era = Paintings of Ancient Macedonian soldiers, arms, and armaments, from the tomb of Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki in Greece, 4th century BC Although by the end of the Theban hegemony the cities of southern Greece were severely weakened, they might have risen again had it not been for the ascent to power of the Macedonian kingdom in northern Greece. Unlike the fiercely independent (and small) city-states, Macedon was a tribal kingdom, ruled by an autocratic king, and importantly, covering a larger area. Once firmly unified, and then expanded, by Phillip II, Macedon possessed the resources that enabled it to dominate the weakened and divided states in southern Greece. Between 356 and 342 BC Phillip conquered all city states in the vicinity of Macedon, then Thessaly and then Thrace. Finally Phillip sought to establish his own hegemony over the southern Greek city- states, and after defeating the combined forces of Athens and Thebes, the two most powerful states, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, succeeded. Now unable to resist him, Phillip compelled most of the city states of southern Greece (including Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos; but not Sparta) to join the Corinthian League, and therefore become allied to him. This established a lasting Macedonian hegemony over Greece, and allowed Phillip the resources and security to launch a war against the Persian Empire. After his assassination, this war was prosecuted by his son Alexander the Great, and resulted in the takeover of the whole Achaemenid Empire by the Macedonians. A united Macedonian empire did not long survive Alexander's death, and soon split into the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Diadochi (Alexander's generals). However, these kingdoms were still enormous states, and continued to fight in the same manner as Phillip and Alexander's armies had. The rise of Macedon and her successors thus sounded the death knell for the distinctive way of war found in Ancient Greece; and instead contributed to the 'superpower' warfare which would dominate the ancient world between 350 and 150 BC. The innovations of Phillip II One major reason for Phillip's success in conquering Greece was the break with Hellenic military traditions that he made. With more resources available, he was able to assemble a more diverse army, including strong cavalry components. He took the development of the phalanx to its logical completion, arming his 'phalangites' (for they were assuredly not hoplites) with a fearsome pike, the 'sarissa'. Much more lightly armored, the Macedonian phalanx was not so much a shield-wall as a spear-wall. The Macedonian phalanx was a supreme defensive formation, but was not intended to be decisive offensively; instead, it was used to pin down the enemy infantry, whilst more mobile forces (such as cavalry) outflanked them. This 'combined arms' approach was furthered by the extensive use of skirmishers, such as peltasts. Tactically, Phillip absorbed the lessons of centuries of warfare in Greece. He echoed the tactics of Epaminondas at Chaeronea, by not engaging his right wing against the Thebans until his left wing had routed the Athenians; thus in course outnumbering and outflanking the Thebans, and securing victory. Alexander's fame is in no small part due to his success as a battlefield tactician; the unorthodox gambits he used at the battles of Issus and Gaugamela were unlike anything seen in Ancient Greece before.

Greek ","title":"Ancient Greek warfare"},{"id":"2830045","text":"The 360 Crescent is a martial arts kick that received its name from the motion of the kick itself. It is also sometimes called, 360 kick, or Jump spin kick. The practitioner jumps into the air and executes a 360 degree turn while keeping his or her body perpendicular to the ground. As soon as the kicker leaves the ground the kicking leg should be extended as straight and high as possible. The kicking leg is normally the same side as the direction that the practitioner is spinning. For example, it will be the right leg if the practitioner is spinning to the right or the left leg if the practitioner is spinning to the left. Variations The different variations depend solely on the position of the hips and the direction the toes of the kicking foot are pointing. The mechanics to all the variations are basically unchanged from what is described above. *360 Crescent :Here the toes are pointing either directly up or straight forward. If aiming for a target, the target is hit with either the blade of foot (outer edge from heel to pinky toe) or with the side of the heel. The hips rotate completely around, generating a good amount of power and speed, however the reach is somewhat shortened by the position of the body. *360 Hook :Here the toes are pointing in the direction opposite of the direction the heel of the foot is moving. If aiming for a target, the target would be hit with the heel of the foot, maybe the flat of the foot depending on the material of the target. The hips do not rotate as much a crescent, but it is easier to obtain farther reach this way. Because of the way the hips rotate, the body bends towards the direction opposite of the kick, sometimes making it difficult for beginners to maintain balance on the landing. This kick is sometimes called a Jumping reverse roundhouse kick *360 Split Hook Kick :Also known as Helicopter Kick, the distinguishing feature to this kick is that the practitioner does the splits in midair. After completing approximately 180 degrees of the rotation, both legs are kicked outward in opposite directions. Because the legs are thrown in opposite directions, a stall in the rotation is created which can give the appearance of floating. Once the legs are brought back in the rotation can be partially recovered to finish the landing. Some practitioners do not recover the rotation for stylistic purposes. Jean-Claude Van Damme was well known for executing this kick in many of his movies. *Split Kick to Hook :Though not widely practiced or even officially named, the Split kick to Hook kick still shares some similarities to a traditional 360 kick. First the practitioner will jump and execute a basic split kick where both legs are kick out like snap kicks in opposite directions. Immediately afterwards, the practitioner will then begin to rotate their body in order to swing one of their legs around into a hook kick. Though the body does not rotate a full 360 degrees, it has to rotate much more than 180 degrees to be properly executed. This move was developed by Anthony Atkins. *360 to the Splits :All variations of the 360 can be landed in the splits, however the more the hips rotate, the easier it is to set it up. Once the kicking leg has executed the kick, it is swung back while the other leg is maneuvered forward. *360 Gyro :This is simply a normal 360 kick where an additional 360 degrees of spinning is executed after the kick, effectively spinning 720 degrees. A 360 Gyro is normally executed as a crescent, mainly because of the easier rotation of the hips after the kick. This is comparable to a 720 kick. =720 kicks= A derivative of the 360 kick is the 720 kick. The mechanics to 720s are all but identical to 360s. The only real difference is that the amount of torque and height needed to execute a 720 is greater than that necessary for a 360. Although the name implies 720 degrees of rotation, the move is usually done with approximately 540 degrees of rotation. This happens cause the tricking terms often count the step in part of the move as actual rotation. The 720 also has some variants. *720 Crescent :Also known as simply a 720, this is very similar to a 360 gyro in that the degree of rotation is the same. The main difference is that the spinning is executed first, then kick is thrown out (which is normally a hook kick due to the smaller amount of rotation needed). Many tricksters execute a Cheat 720 or a 540 wheel in place of this move due to the extra amount of rotation needed. *720 Double :The distinguishing feature to this move is that the crescent and/or hook kick is thrown twice, once after the during the first rotation of 360 degrees and another during the last rotation. Because the kick is thrown with the same leg, the difficulty of this move comes from retracting the leg towards the body just enough to throw the second kick. *720 Triple :Three kicks are executed much like a 720 double. The third kick is actually added in between the two from the 720 double. After the first kick is thrown, the opposite leg will throw either a crescent or roundhouse kick. This is then followed by the second hook kick. The order and appearance of the kicks is very comparable to those of a 540 triple. The main and definitively distinguishing feature is that a 720 triple's take off is done by jumping off of both legs. =1080 kicks= Yet another derivative of the 360 kick is the 1080 kick. It is the same principle as a 720 except that there are two and a half spins plus the step in, instead of one and a half, hence the name \\"1080\\". While theoretically all the variations of the original 360 kick are applicable to a 1080 kick, there are actually few variations of a 1080 that have actually be successfully executed. Some of them include the 1080 Double and the Cheat 1080. Some tricking practitioners as Gary Ip already broke the mark of the 1260 kick, which involves approximately three spins in the air executing a round/crescent kick before the non-kicking feet hits the ground. Because of the difficulty of this move, it is often performed only by those who already have years of kicking/Martial Arts training.

Biography Murray was born in Gillingham, Kent, England on 3 April 1946. Before joining Elton John as his touring sidemen, Murray and drummer Nigel Olsson were members of the Spencer Davis Group in 1969. In Murray's musician bio in the programme book for 1982's \\"Jump Up!\\" tour, Murray recalled when he first took up the bass guitar during his high school years: \\"Someone put this heavy thing over my shoulder and said, 'Here, you play this!'\\" Murray quickly established a solid reputation on the instrument. In the Classic Albums documentary on Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, producer Gus Dudgeon lauded Murray's musical ability, and said he hadn't heard a bassist quite as good as him. Murray and Olsson joined John as his road sidemen in 1970, and first appeared together on disc with John on \\"Amoreena\\" from the 1970 studio album Tumbleweed Connection. The following year, they were featured on the live album 17-11-70. While they were John's constant touring bandmates, his record company initially only allowed them to play on just one track per studio album. This changed with Honky Ch√¢teau in 1972 when John exerted some of his skyrocketing popularity at the time to convince DJM to allow Murray and Olsson to also become full-time recording members of his band. Along with fellow new recruit Davey Johnstone on guitars, banjo, mandolin, sitar, fretted string instruments and backing vocals, Murray and Olsson played on John's hit albums, including the milestone album Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, singles, and world tours for several years. In 1975, after recording Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy, Murray and Olsson were released from the band because John wanted to achieve a different sound. He said at the time \\"The band always rattled along. I want it to chug\\". Murray and Olsson continued working together as session musicians in Los Angeles and they played on Rick Springfield's first United States album, Wait for Night (1976). In 1977, Murray briefly joined Procol Harum on a North America tour promoting their last 1970s album, Something Magic, although he never recorded with the group. Between 1978 and 1979, Murray worked as part of Alice Cooper's backing band. According to music site AllMusic.com, he played on Cooper's hit album From the Inside, and joined Olsson backing The Grateful Dead's Bob Weir on his solo album Heaven Help the Fool in 1978. Other artists he worked with during the 1970s and early 1980s include Yvonne Elliman (her Night Flight album contained the hit single \\"If I Can't Have You,\\" composed by The Bee Gees), Shaun Cassidy, Allan Clarke, Bernie Taupin, Kiki Dee, Stefanie Gaines, Barbi Benton and Jimmy Webb. Murray and Olsson returned to tour and play sessions with John, starting with 21 at 33 in 1980. He and Olsson backed John during his landmark concert in New York City's Central Park before more than 400,000 fans on the Great Lawn on 13 September 1980, and appeared on The Fox in 1981. Murray went on to contribute all the bass tracks on Jump Up! in 1982, and joined Olsson and guitarist Davey Johnstone for the Jump Up! Tour, followed by albums and tours for Too Low for Zero (1983) and Breaking Hearts (1984). The group then disbanded, reuniting once more to record backing vocals on Reg Strikes Back in 1988. In the 1980s, Murray played on numerous Nashville sessions for artists such as Michael Brown, Lewis Storey, Beth Nielsen Chapman and John Prine, amongst others. Death Battling skin cancer for a number of years, Murray died in 1992 at the age of 45, in Nashville, Tennessee, after suffering a stroke. According to Murray's obituary, that March, John performed two tribute concerts at the Grand Ole Opry to raise money to support Murray's family. Olsson, upon again becoming a full-time band member with John in 2004 to record Peachtree Road, reflected upon the absence of his longtime bandmate: \\"We will never again create anything as wonderful‚Äìas inspirational‚Äìwithout Dee‚Äôs presence\\". Davey Johnstone believes Murray's musical skills were not fully appreciated, and in March 2011, said he was working on a documentary about the bass player.

Goldsmith is a virtual ghost town today, but over a hundred years ago it was a bustling community with a school, a post office, two hotels, a grand ball room and numerous houses. A sawmill was located along the North Branch of the Saranac River, and a dam formed a small lake or mill pond extending up to Slab Bridge. The land, once logged, proved to be excellent farm land. Goldsmith was one of the first Adirondack villages to have electricity. Much of the land was granted by Garret Smith, some to escaped or freed slaves. Charcoal was an early product, made for nearby forges. The dam was blown out in 1926, and the mill closed. Farming remained vibrant. Hops were grown during Prohibition. Few year round residents remain. Much of the land around Slab Bridge was subdivided into small 1 and lots. The Nature Conservancy has purchased much of the area of Goldsmith.

The Huronian glaciation followed the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), a time when increased atmospheric oxygen decreased atmospheric methane. The oxygen combined with the methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which do not retain heat as well as methane does. The glaciation led to a mass extinction on Earth.  Discovery and name  In 1907, Arthur Philemon Coleman first inferred a \\"lower Huronian ice age\\" from analysis of a geological formation near Lake Huron in North America. This formation consists of two non-glacial sediment deposits found between three horizons of glacial deposits of the Huronian Supergroup, deposited between 2.5 and 2.2 billion years ago. =Other evidence= The Gowganda Formation (2.3 Ga) contains \\"the most widespread and most convincing glaciogenic deposits of this era\\", according to Eyles and Young. Similar deposits are found in Michigan (2.1‚Äì2 Ga), the Black Hills (2.6‚Äì1.6 Ga), Chibougamau, Canadian Northern Territories (2.1 Ga) and Wyoming. Similar age deposits occur in the Griquatown Basin (2.3 Ga), India (1.8 Ga) and Australia (2.5‚Äî2.0 Ga).  Geological context  The tectonic setting was one of a rifting continental margin. New continental crust would have resulted in chemical weathering. This weathering would pull CO2 out of the atmosphere, cooling the planet through the reduction in greenhouse effect.  Causes and effects  Before the Huronian Ice Age, most organisms were anaerobic, but around this time, the cyanobacteria evolved oxygenic photosynthesis. These bacteria were able to reproduce at exponential rates due to their new ecological niche, exploiting the abundant energy of the sunlight. Their photosynthesis produced oxygen as a waste product expelled into the air. At first, most of this oxygen was absorbed through the oxidation of surface iron and the decomposition of life forms. However, as the population of the cyanobacteria continued to grow, these oxygen sinks became saturated. As oxygen \\"polluted\\" the mostly methane atmosphere, a mass extinction occurred of most life forms, which were anaerobic and to whom oxygen was toxic. Methane turned from dominant in the atmosphere to a trace gas, as it was oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. A different atmosphere emerged which was thinner, with less powerful greenhouse gases. Earth's temperature dropped, partly because solar luminosity was lower at that time so the Earth was more vulnerable to a decline in greenhouse gases. The Huronian Ice Age is thought to be the first time Earth was completely covered in ice, and to have practically stopped photosynthesis.

According to Eyles and Young, \\"A major glacial episode at c. 440 Ma, is recorded in Late Ordovician strata (predominantly Ashgillian) in West Africa (Tamadjert Formation of the Sahara), in Morocco (Tindouf Basin) and in west-central Saudi Arabia, all areas at polar latitudes at the time. From the Late Ordovician to the Early Silurian the centre of glaciation moved from northern Africa to southwestern South America.\\" During this period glaciation is known from Arabia, Sahara, West Africa, the south Amazon, and the Andes. The center of glaciation migrated from Sahara in the Ordovician (450‚Äì440 Ma) to South America in the Silurian (440‚Äì420 Ma). The maximum extent of glaciation developed in Africa and eastern Brazil. A minor ice age, the Andean-Saharan was preceded by the Cryogenian ice ages (720‚Äì630 Ma, the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations), often referred to as Snowball Earth, and followed by the Karoo Ice Age (350‚Äì260 Ma).

The book Benevolent Assimilation recounts that Taft \\"assured President McKinley that 'our little brown brothers' would need 'fifty or one hundred years' of close supervision 'to develop anything resembling Anglo-Saxon political principles and skills, and reports that the military greeted Taft's assertion, \\"that 'Filipinos are moved by similar considerations to those which move other men' with utter scorn.\\" A 1961 book by Leon Wolff, titled Little Brown Brother and subtitled \\"How the United States purchased and pacified the Philippine Islands at the century's turn\\", was awarded the 1962 Francis Parkman Prize by the Society of American Historians as the best- written book in American history that year. A reissued 2001 edition of that book contains accounts of numerous atrocities committed by U.S. soldiers during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The term was not originally intended to be derogatory, nor an ethnic slur; instead, it is a reflection of paternalist racism, shared also by Theodore Roosevelt.

Named after Saturn's moon Hyperion, she is the only ship of the Navy to bear this name. Construction Hyperion, was laid down 28 May 1943, as Liberty ship SS Christopher C. Andrews, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1563, by Permanente Metals Corporation, Yard No. 1, Richmond, California; sponsored by Mrs. Percy Lindt; launched 24 June 1943; acquired by the Navy from the War Shipping Administration (WSA) 10 July 1943; and commissioned 25 August 1943, at San Diego, Lieutenant Commander Charles C. Newman in command. Service history With gasoline barge in tow, Hyperion sailed for the Pacific 18 September 1943, on what was to be a memorable voyage. During the 42-day trip, the tow was lost twice; lightning struck the mainmast; a crewman was lost in high seas; and emergency flares were spotted but nothing was found. Hyperion finally reached Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides on 30 October 1943. The following half year saw the cargo ship shuttling among the Solomon Islands bringing valuable supplies ‚Äî gasoline, diesel oil, rolling stock, foodstuffs ‚Äî to the staging area for some of the Pacific's most hard- fought campaigns. On 5 April 1944 Hyperion steamed from the Solomons with 45 passengers in addition to her usual cargo of oil and supplies. Arriving 10 April 1944, at Emirau Island in the Bismarcks, occupied only three weeks earlier, Hyperion discharged cargo by day and steamed out to safety at night. She then returned to her valuable work in the staging areas, operating between New Caledonia, Guadalcanal, New Zealand, and the Bismarcks. In the fall of 1944, as the war advanced steadily across the Pacific and culminated in the climactic Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the greatest naval engagements of all time, Hyperion had her first taste of battle. Departing Espiritu Santo 22 September, Hyperion picked up stores at Tulagi and joined TG 78.8's reinforcement group which supported Admiral Daniel Barbey's Northern Attack Force TF 78. She sailed into Leyte Gulf in a 33-ship convoy 29 October 1944, only three days after the conclusion of that great battle. During the next two weeks, Hyperion went to general quarters 87 times, fought off 37 Japanese air attacks, and splashed 2 enemy planes. Another tour of duty shuttling cargo in the staging area between New Zealand and New Caledonia ended in late April 1945, as Hyperion loaded of US Army engineering equipment at Noum√©a and steamed for Okinawa, still the scene of bloody fighting. During the 18 days it took her to discharge cargo at Okinawa beginning 8 May 1945, Hyperion witnessed naval bombardments of the Japanese positions on the island, the battles of Naha and Shuri, and countless kamikaze attacks ‚Äî she was anchored less than from when two suicide planes damaged the battleship 12 May 1945.  Post-war decommissioning  As the war drew to a close, Hyperion sailed for San Francisco, California on 4 August 1945, ending two years of continuous service in the Pacific. The cargo ship had steamed some , carried of cargo, transported over 1,000 passengers, made 62 voyages to 29 islands and 37 ports, and had fought at Leyte and Okinawa, Hyperion had crossed the equator six times and the international date line four times, she celebrated two Fourth of Julys in 1944. After minor repairs at San Francisco, which she reached 24 August 1945, Hyperion sailed for the East Coast via the Panama Canal. Reaching Norfolk, Virginia on 24 October 1945, she decommissioned 16 November 1945, and was returned to the WSA the following day. Hyperion was placed in the MARCOM National Defense Reserve Fleet, and was berthed in the James River Group, Lee Hall, Virginia. On 31 July 1961, she was sold to Bethlehem Steel, along with 3 other ships, for $280,000. She was delivered 11 August 1961. Awards Hyperion received three battle stars for World War II service.

The series initially consisted of a trilogy: Across the Nightingale Floor (2002), Grass for His Pillow (2003), and Brilliance of the Moon (2004). It was followed in 2006 by a sequel, The Harsh Cry of the Heron, and in 2007 by a prequel, Heaven's Net is Wide. In 2020, two new books were published in a sequel series called \\"Children of the Otori\\", Orphan Warriors and Sibling Assassins. The books follow a young warrior named Takeo in his struggles to avenge his adoptive father, escape the legacy of his biological father, and pursue the love of his life in the midst of an enormous power struggle involving dozens of clan lords and thousands of warriors. Synopsis Map of the Three Countries \\"Five battles to fight. Four to win, one to lose.\\"  The Trilogy  The story is told primarily in first-person narrative by Otori Takeo. He was born as Tomasu in Mino, a small village that houses amongst its people, religious outcasts referred to as the \\"Hidden\\". The Hidden are persecuted throughout the Three Countries for their beliefs, and in the opening chapter Mino is destroyed by the warriors of Iida Sadamu, Lord of the Tohan Clan. Takeo is rescued by Otori Shigeru, a young Lord of the Otori Clan which has a long-standing rivalry with the Tohan, and led back to the Otori stronghold of Hagi. There, Shigeru adopts Takeo and begins to instruct him in the ways of a warrior. Shigeru's uncles, hoping to rid themselves of their popular and powerful nephew, send him to Iida's capital city of Inuyama, ostensibly to be married to a young princess from a different clan named Kaede. Unexpectedly, Kaede and Takeo fall in love at first sight. As the delegation arrives at Inuyama, it is revealed that Takeo's biological father was of The Tribe, a group of families with special powers, and they abduct Takeo, making a claim upon him because of his ancestry. Takeo strikes a deal with them and escapes them, but he arrives too late: Shigeru is betrayed and killed, Iida ultimately perishes at Kaede's hand after attempting to rape her, and the country is overrun by the army of Arai Daiichi. Takeo is torn between conflicting obligations: to avenge Shigeru's death and claim leadership of the Otori clan; to submit to the Tribe's claim on him; and to follow his heart and marry Shirakawa Kaede. These conflicts drive his actions throughout the trilogy, placing him at odds with the Tribe, the Otori Lords, and the armies of Arai Daiichi. For a more detailed synopsis, see the individual entries for each novel: *Across the Nightingale Floor *Grass for His Pillow *Brilliance of the Moon The Harsh Cry of the Heron Sixteen years later, Takeo is ruler of the Three Countries, and has three daughters: Shigeko, and twins Maya and Miki (the latter two have inherited tribal skills from their Kikuta bloodline). Arai Zenko (Daiichi's son) and his wife Hana (Kaede's youngest sister) plot for Takeo's overthrow with the help of the leader of the Kikuta, Akio, and Takeo's secret teenage son by Muto Yuki, Hisao. Hisao was raised by Akio, and is a ghostmaster, able to communicate with the dead, including his dead mother. After Muto Kenji dies, the loyalty of the Tribe clans to Takeo starts to wane. Despite installing Shigeko as Lady Maruyama and winning over the Emperor, his army is forced to battle the Emperor's general, Lord Saga, while Zenko raises an army in alliance with the western barbarians. Kaede bears a son, but after he dies, and Hana reveals to her that Hisao is Takeo's son, she is driven temporarily insane. Now against Takeo, she destroys the castle at Hagi, and seeks sanctuary with Arai and Hana. Takeo seeks sanctuary at Terayama, where he is attacked by Akio and Hisao. At the crucial moment Hisao freezes; Akio takes the gun, which explodes in his hands, killing himself and fatally wounding Maya. Takeo, acknowledging that it is his time, holds a knife in Hisao's hand and falls upon it, ensuring the prophecy of his death is fulfilled. Shigeko enters into a treaty with Saga, whose army defeats Arai Zenko, and she will marry him as part of the bargain to ensure peace. They will be co-rulers in the Three Countries. In remorse, Kaede considers taking her own life, but at the last moment decides to live on for the sake of her daughter Miki. Heaven's Net is Wide This prequel begins about 17 years before the start of the trilogy, and ends at Takeo's and Shigeru's meeting that begins Across the Nightingale Floor. It follows Shigeru's childhood, his training with Matsuda Shingen, and his coming of age. Frustrated by his father's indecision and his uncle's obscure motives, he takes a band of warriors to the border with the Tohan, and discovers a village of the Hidden, tortured and killed by the Tohan. He encounters the belief system of the Hidden, and meets Iida Sadamu for the first time, sparing his life. Later, the novel covers his brief turbulent marriage, his relationship with the courtesan Akane, and the battle of Yaegahara. The Noguchi betray them, ensuring the Otori defeat, and victory for Iida Sadamu. Otori Shigemori perishes, but Jato, the ancestral sword, finds its way to his son Shigeru, via a member of the Tribe, Muto Kenji. Shigeru is forced to abdicate, and he patiently waits for an opportunity to avenge his father. Under the guise of a simple farmer, he secretly compiles records on the Tribe, assisted by Muto Shizuka, and conducts a covert relationship with Maruyama Naomi.

Other Clans (d)-daughter (s)-son (d.)-dead The Tribe The Tribe are a secret organisation that nurture the powers that the world used to have. The Tribe consists of five families that existed before the lords and the clans, a time when magic was common. Since that time the Tribe have retained these abilities through dedication and training. They are frequently employed as spies and assassins by various institutions within the Three Countries. While they usually take on the guise of merchants or travelling actors and acrobats, some members of the Tribe live rather unassuming lives as traders and money lenders rather than as spies and assassins. They are like ninjas. Little is known about the nature of the Tribe, and the organization is rarely employed with complete trust. Most of the information that exists on the Tribe was secretly compiled by Otori Shigeru with the help of Muto Shizuka. Unfortunately for the Tribe, the abilities they possess are being lost with new generations, possibly due to inbreeding depression. This theory is likely since some Tribe members with a non-Tribe parent have shown to have great abilities. =Kikuta= The most ferocious family that is known for its power, harshness, and skilled assassins. They are the pre-eminent tribal family in Tohan territory. Many true Kikuta have a straight palm line across their hand and have great powers, such as invisibility, splitting off a phantom body, acute hearing, and the ability to put someone in a deep sleep merely by staring at them (the 'Kikuta sleep'). It was said that many of the Kikuta gifts were dying out, which was why the Tribe desired Takeo's talents so much. Minor skills, possess by the weaker Kikuta, include agility and the ability to perceive invisibility and the second self. In some very rare cases, some Kikuta members are ghost masters, and have the ability to communicate with the spirits of the deceased, as well as commanding them. The Kikuta Master was Kikuta Kotaro, followed by his nephew Kikuta Akio. They are very traditional in their thinking and do not want to let peace succeed throughout the three countries. Takeo's father Kikuta Isamu was the greatest assassin in the Kikuta before he met Takeo's mother and defected to The Hidden. He was killed later by Kikuta Kotaro when he had refused to fight him because of the Hidden's religion and the vow he made to never kill again after he married Takeo's mother. =Muto= One of the two large clans of the Tribe that still have substantial gifts, and the major family in the Middle Country. They are renowned for their changing faces; as such, they are skilled as spies. They also share some of the more famous skills of the Tribe with the Kikuta, such as invisibility. The Master of the Muto was Muto Kenji, and after his death, Muto Shizuka. The Muto have strong links with the Otori and believe that the Tribe should change in the future. At the beginning of the series there is a close alliance between the Muto and Kikuta which wanes throughout the series. Controversy surrounded Shizuka's appointment as head of the clan, firstly because she was a woman, and secondly because she was appointed by Otori Takeo and not by the family. =Kuroda= A lesser clan of the Tribe that are mainly merchants, money lenders and informants. They possess some of the gifts of the greater clans, and a characteristic practicality which makes them superb assassins (e.g. Kuroda Shintaro). In The Harsh Cry of the Heron it is mentioned that the Kuroda can perceive invisibility, but cannot become invisible themselves. The only other Kuroda character encountered in the series is Kondo Kiichi (taking the name Kondo from adoption into his mother's side of the family.) =Kudo and Imai= The two lesser clans of the Tribe. They mostly work as grooms and servants.  Trivia  *The name \\"Hidden\\" for the secretly held religious system of belief probably comes from the title that Christians once held in feudal Japan, \\"Kakure Kirishitan,\\" literally \\"Hidden Christians.\\" First Catholics and soon Protestants as well were persecuted by the Tokugawa family after the battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Catholics were treated much more brutally, and were publicly executed. Thus, many devout believers concealed their faiths and became \\"Hidden.\\" *The three religions in the novel are very similar to three actual religions: the \\"Hidden\\" are similar to Christians (although actual Christians do appear later on in the series), those who worship \\"the enlightened one\\" follow similar beliefs to Buddhists, and those who believe in the spirits of nature are Shinto (Japan's native religion). *Takeo's real name, \\"Tomasu\\" is the Japanese pronunciation of the Christian name \\"Thomas\\", as the name of Hidden outcast Jo-An could be perceived as a variation of \\"John\\". Tomasu's sister, Madaren, is the Japanese version of Madeline, and his other sister, Maruta, could be a version of \\"Martha\\".

In the , Woody Point had a population of 4,418 people. Along with its neighbouring coastal suburbs on the Redcliffe Peninsula, the suburb is a popular recreational destination within the Brisbane metropolitan area.  Geography  Woody Point jetty and beach Woody Point is at the south- east of the Redcliffe Peninsula, approximately by roadnorth-northeast of Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia. The suburb is bounded by Moreton Bay to the east, Bramble Bay to the south, roughly by unnamed drain to the west and roughly by King Street to the north. There are three headlands along the eastern coast of the suburb. At the southern tip is Woody Point (), also known as Ningeryoun, first marked on a 1840s survey map by James Charles Burnett. Further north are: * Picnic Point () * Scotts Point (), which was probably named after surgeon Peter Walter Scott who was the storekeeper in Moreton Bay penal settlement between 1824 to 1926. History Woody Point shoreline, ca. 1876 In 1799, Matthew Flinders landed on the peninsula and named the location Red Cliff Point after the colours in the cliffs. In 1823 the peninsula was selected as the site of Queensland's first (and only) penal colony (Moreton Bay penal settlement) but, after arriving in 1924 to establish the colony, problems with mosquitoes and the resistance from local Aboriginals caused the colony tp relocate up the Brisbane River in 1825, founding the city of Brisbane. Redcliffe developed s small seaside retreat accessibly only by boat from Brisbane while Woody Point was originally a banana plantation. Woody Point Jetty was built in 1888. It was reconstructed during 2008 at a cost of $9.6 million. When the Hornibrook Bridge opened in 1935 (later replaced by the Houghton Highway and Ted Smout Memorial Bridge ), it linked Brighton, the most north-eastern suburb in the City of Brisbane, across Hays Inlet to Clontarf on the Redcliffe Peninsula. By improving the road connection between them, Redcliffe then became much more accessible and grew as part of Brisbane's suburban sprawl. Our Lady of Lourdes School opened on 1969 and closed on 1995. Woody Point Special School opened on 21 August 1978. Southern Cross Catholic College (Woody Point Primary) opened on 2002, being formed by the amalgamation of 3 catholic primary schools of the Peninsula, Brigidine College and De La Salle College. In 1958, HMQS Gayundah was run aground at Woody Point to create a breakwater. The foundation stone of St Mark's Anglican Church was laid at 46 Kate Street (corner of Annie Street, ) on Sunday 26 April 1953 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. The church was dedicated on 7 April 1957 by Archbishop Halse. It was consecrated on 28 April 1968 by Archbishop Philip Strong. In the 1990s it was decided to combine the congregations of St Mark's and St Barbanas' in Clontarf into a new St Peter the Fisherman's Anglican Church at Clontarf. This led to the closure of St Mark's on 24 April 1993 which was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. St Peter the Fisherman's was dedicated in 1993. As at July 2020, the St Mark's site has been converted into a multi-unit dwelling but the foundation stone is still visible on the street corner. Woody Point's Apex Park & Bicentennial Park were constructed by reclaiming land along the foreshore in the 1970s. In the , Woody Point had a population of 4,418 people.

She was a victim in a power struggle at the hands of Emperor Zhang's empress consort, Empress Dou. Consort Song was the older daughter of Song Yang (ÂÆãÊ•ä), a seventh-generation descendant of Song Chang (ÂÆãÊòå), an important official during the reign of Emperor Wen. Song Yang was famed for his filial piety. His aunt was the maternal grandmother of Emperor Ming's wife Empress Ma, and Empress Ma, upon hearing that his two daughters were both intelligent and beautiful, selected them as consorts for her adopted son, Crown Prince Liu Da. After Liu Da became emperor in 75 (as Emperor Zhang), both of them became imperial consorts. The elder Consort Song gave birth to a son, Liu Qing, in 78, and because Empress Dou did not have a son, Liu Qing was created crown prince in 79. Empress Dou was not satisfied with the situation, however, and in 79, after another imperial consort, Consort Liang, gave birth to a son named Liu Zhao, she adopted Liu Zhao and intended to make him crown prince instead. After Empress Dowager Ma died later that year, Consort Song was left without anyone to protect her, and Empress Dou began to plot her destruction. In 82, an opportunity came for Empress Dou. Consort Song had become ill, and in her illness, she craved raw cuscuta, and she requested that her family bring them. Empress Dou seized the cuscuta and falsely accused Consort Song of using it for witchcraft. Emperor Zhang was enraged and expelled Liu Qing from the palace. He had Consort Song and her sister arrested and interrogated by the eunuch Cai Lun. Consort Song and her sister saw that they were in deep straits, and they committed suicide by poison in June 82 (according to the Zizhi Tongjian). Her son Liu Qing would be deposed and replaced by Liu Zhao, who later became Emperor He.

Widespread in nature, it can be isolated from soil, decaying organic matter, and plants. The major industrial use of this fungus is the production of blue cheeses, flavouring agents, antifungals, polysaccharides, proteases, and other enzymes. The fungus has been a constituent of Roquefort, Stilton, Danish blue, Cabrales, Gorgonzola, and other blue cheeses that humans are known to have eaten since around AD 50; blue cheese is mentioned in literature as far back as AD 79, when Pliny the Elder remarked upon its rich flavour. Other blue cheeses are made with Penicillium glaucum. Classification First described by American mycologist Charles Thom in 1906, P. roqueforti was initially a heterogeneous species of blue-green, sporulating fungi. They were grouped into different species based on phenotypic differences, but later combined into one species by Kenneth B. Raper and Thom (1949). The P. roqueforti group got a reclassification in 1996 due to molecular analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences. Formerly divided into two varieties ‚Äï cheese-making (P. roqueforti var. roqueforti) and patulin- making (P. roqueforti var. carneum) ‚Äï P. roqueforti was reclassified into three species: P. roqueforti, P. carneum, and P. paneum. The complete genome sequence of P. roqueforti was published in 2014. Description As this fungus does not form visible fruiting bodies, descriptions are based on macromorphological characteristics of fungal colonies growing on various standard agar media, and on microscopic characteristics. When grown on Czapek yeast autolysate agar or yeast-extract sucrose (YES) agar, P. roqueforti colonies are typically 40 mm in diameter, olive brown to dull green (dark green to black on the reverse side of the agar plate), with a velutinous texture. Grown on malt extract agar, colonies are 50 mm in diameter, dull green in color (beige to greyish green on the reverse side), with arachnoid (with many spider-web-like fibers) colony margins. Another characteristic morphological feature of this species is its production of asexual spores in phialides with a distinctive brush-shaped configuration. Evidence for a sexual stage in P. roqueforti has been found, based in part on the presence of functional mating-type genes and most of the important genes known to be involved in meiosis. In 2014, researchers reported inducing the growth of sexual structures in P. roqueforti, including ascogonia, cleistothecia, and ascospores. Genetic analysis and comparison of many different strains isolated from various environments around the world indicate that it is a genetically diverse species. P. roqueforti is known to be one of the most common spoilage molds of silage.Skaar I. (1996). Mycological survey and characterisation of the mycobiota of big bale grass silage in Norway. PhD thesis, Norwegian College of Veterinary Medicine, Oslo. It is also one of several different moulds that can spoil bread. Uses The chief industrial use of this species is the production of blue cheeses, such as its namesake Roquefort, Bleu de Bresse, Bleu du Vercors-Sassenage, Brebiblu, Cabrales, Cambozola (Blue Brie), Cashel Blue, Danish blue, Polish Rokpol made from cow's milk, Fourme d'Ambert, Fourme de Montbrison, Lanark Blue, Shropshire Blue, and Stilton, and some varieties of Bleu d'Auvergne and Gorgonzola. (Other blue cheeses, including Bleu de Gex and Rochebaron, use Penicillium glaucum.) Strains of the microorganism are also used to produce compounds that can be employed as antibiotics, flavours, and fragrances,(Sharpell, 1985) uses not regulated under the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act. Its texture is chitinous. Secondary metabolites Considerable evidence indicates that most strains are capable of producing harmful secondary metabolites (alkaloids and other mycotoxins) under certain growth conditions. Aristolochene is a sesquiterpenoid compound produced by P. roqueforti, and is likely a precursor to the toxin known as PR toxin, made in large amounts by the fungus. PR-toxin has been implicated in incidents of mycotoxicoses resulting from eating contaminated grains. However, PR toxin is not stable in cheese and breaks down to the less toxic PR imine. Secondary metabolites of P. roqueforti, named andrastins A-D, are found in blue cheese. The andrastins inhibit proteins involved in the efflux of anticancer drugs from multidrug-resistant cancer cells. P. roqueforti also produces the neurotoxin roquefortine C. However, the levels of roquefortine c in cheese made from it is usually too low to produce toxic effects. The organism can also be used for the production of proteases and specialty chemicals, such as methyl ketones, including 2-heptanone.

It advocates in favor of progressive public policy changes including immigration reform, a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and reduced deportations. Founded in 1968 (as NCLR), UnidosUS has regional offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Phoenix, San Antonio and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. History NCLR's former logo before becoming UnidosUS In 1963, a group of Mexican Americans in Washington, D.C. formed the National Organization for Mexican American Services (NOMAS). The organization existed primarily to provide technical assistance to Hispanic groups and bring them together under one umbrella. NOMAS presented a proposal to the Ford Foundation to establish an organization that could provide technical assistance and organizational structure to the Mexican American community. The Ford Foundation hired Herman Gallegos, Julian Samora, and Ernesto Galarza to travel the Southwest and make a recommendation on how the Ford Foundation could help Mexican Americans. Gallegos, Samora and Galarza founded the Southwest Council of La Raza (SWCLR) in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1968. SWCLR was given financial support from the Ford Foundation, the National Council of Churches, and the United Auto Workers, and the organization received 501(c)(3) status later that year. In 1973, the SWCLR became a national organization, changed its name to the National Council of La Raza, and moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C. Early disagreements among the organization's leadership caused the Ford Foundation to threaten to withhold funding, resulting in President Henry Santiestevan's resignation and the election of Raul Yzaguirre. The Spanish word raza is often translated into English as race. The phrase La Raza has a particular history in the context of political activism in which NCLR uses it. NCLR uses \\"La Raza\\" to refer to \\"the people\\" or \\"the Hispanic people of the New World.\\" Beginning in about 1975, the NCLR began expanding its focus to include the issues of non-Mexican American Latinos. This policy was made official in 1979. By 1980, the NCLR was funded almost entirely by the federal government. When the Reagan Administration reduced available federal funding, the NCLR cut back the scale of its operations. As a result, the organization began focusing on national policy and concentrating its efforts in Washington, D.C. After the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, state governments exerted more control over the disbursement of welfare funds, which led to the development of the NCLR's Field Advocacy Project to influence decisions at the state and local levels. On January 1, 2005, Janet Murgu√≠a replaced Raul Yzaguirre as the president and CEO. On July 10, 2017, NCLR announced its new name, UnidosUS.

Early life Camp was born in London and was evacuated during World War II to the United States as a child with his mother and sister. He became a child actor in films and onstage. He originally performed under the names Robin Camp and Bob Camp, later changing his name to Hamilton after joining the Subud spiritual movement. For a few years, he billed himself as Hamid Hamilton Camp; in this period, he was leader of a group called Skymonters that released an album in 1973 on Elektra. The band consisted of himself (vocals, guitar), Lewis Arquette (vocals, comedy monologues), Lewis Ross (lead guitar), Jakub Ander (bass) and Rusdi Lane (percussionist & mime). Career Camp's debut as a folk singer was at the Newport Folk Festival in 1960; and his first recording, with Bob Gibson, was Bob Gibson & Bob Camp at the Gate of Horn, from 1961. Over the next four decades he maintained a dual career as a musician/songwriter and as an actor. He appeared in nearly one hundred films and television programmes. Camp is probably best known, however, as the author of the song \\"Pride of Man\\", which was recorded by a number of artists, notably Quicksilver Messenger Service, Gram Parsons and Gordon Lightfoot, who included it as one of three songs by other songwriters on his first record. An early Gibson & Camp gospel song, \\"You Can Tell the World\\" was the opening track on Simon & Garfunkel's first album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. As a singer, Camp had a minor hit with the song \\"Here's to You,\\" which peaked at number 76 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968. In 1969 Camp formed a group called The True Brethren with Waqidi Falicoff (guitar, vocals), Raphael Grinage (cello) and Loren Pickford (flute and saxophone). The four later composed the incidental music for the Broadway show Paul Sills' Story Theatre, which won two Tony awards and was nominated for best show in the 1971 awards. His voice work as \\"Elle\\" the robot policeman in the 1978 film Starcrash is a cult favourite and he had a memorable role in the 1976 Peter Bogdanovich film Nickelodeon. He also performed with the Chicago comedy troupe The Second City and the San Francisco satirical comedy troupe the Committee and appeared in a number of stage productions, including a 2004 production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Hollywood Bowl. His television work includes a supporting role on He & She, a sitcom starring Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss, which ran for one season in 1967‚Äì68. He guest-starred on popular television shows such as The Rat Patrol, The Monkees, M*A*S*H, Soap, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Twilight Zone, Starsky and Hutch, Cheers, The Andy Griffith Show, Bewitched, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., Three's Company and Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, as the older H. G. Wells. He appeared on two episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as Leck, a Ferengi and on one episode of Star Trek: Voyager as a Malon freighter pilot. In 1977, Camp appeared in three episodes of The Feather and Father Gang. In the 1978 opening season of WKRP in Cincinnati, Camp guest-starred in the fifth episode as Del Murdock, owner of Del's Stereo and Sound. He returned to WKRP as Johnny Fever's ex-wife's new fianc√©. Also in 1978, he played Warren Beatty's valet, Bentley, in Heaven Can Wait. In 1980, he appeared as a semi- regular on Too Close for Comfort as Arthur Wainwright, the adventurous, youth- oriented boss of Henry Rush, and on the FOX sitcom Titus as Erin Fitzpatrick's alcoholic father, Merritt. He played Bart Furley, brother of Don Knotts' character Ralph Furley, on an episode of Three's Company, \\"Furley vs. Furley\\". He also voiced Professor Moriarty in the English dub of the anime series Sherlock Hound. He was the voice of Fenton Crackshell, aka GizmoDuck, on the Disney animated series DuckTales and its spinoff Darkwing Duck. He played the role of old Malcolm Corley in LucasArts' graphic adventure Full Throttle. He voiced the Prophet of Mercy in the 2004 video game Halo 2. He became Disney Studio's new voice of Merlin, following the death of Karl Swenson. Hamilton Camp also voiced for Hanna‚ÄìBarbera; as Greedy Smurf and Harmony Smurf on The Smurfs series and all of HB's Smurf television specials, Count Dracula in Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf, Turk Tarpit in The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones, Mr. Gruber in Paddington Bear, The Grand Dozer on Potsworth & Co., Samurai Ghost on the episode \\"Now Museum, Now You Don't\\" from A Pup Named Scooby-Doo and Barney Rubble as a kid in The Flintstones Kids.

The use of Hokkien in the Philippines is influenced by Philippine Spanish, Tagalog and Philippine English. Hokaglish is an oral contact language involving Philippine Hokkien, Tagalog and English. Hokaglish shows similarities to Taglish (mixed Tagalog and English), the everyday mesolect register of spoken Filipino language within Metro Manila and its environs. Terminology The term Philippine Hokkien is used when differentiating the variety of Hokkien spoken in the Philippines from those spoken in China, Taiwan and other Southeast Asian countries. Sometimes, it is also colloquially known as Fookien or Fukien around the country. Sociolinguistics Only 12.2% of all ethnic Chinese in the Philippines have a variety of Chinese as their mother tongue. Nevertheless, the vast majority (77%) still retain the ability to understand and speak Hokkien as a second or third language.Teresita Ang-See, \\"Chinese in the Philippines\\", 1997, Kaisa, pg. 57.  History  Spanish Dominican Friar Juan Cobo, written in Classical Chinese mostly in dialogue form based on Hokkien used in Spanish Colonial Philippines. In the early 17th century, Spanish missionaries in the Philippines produced materials documenting the Hokkien varieties spoken by the Chinese trading community who had settled there in the late 16th century: *Diccionarium Sino-Hispanicum (1604), a Spanish-Hokkien dictionary, giving equivalent words, but not definitions. *Doctrina Christiana en letra y lengua china (1607), a Hokkien translation of the Doctrina Christiana. *Bocabulario de la lengua sangleya (c. 1617), a Spanish-Hokkien dictionary, with definitions. *Arte de la Lengua Chi√µ Chiu (1620), a grammar written by a Spanish missionary in the Philippines. These texts appear to record a Zhangzhou dialect of Hokkien, from the area of Haicheng (an old port that is now part of Longhai). Education , the Ateneo de Manila University, under their Chinese Studies Programme, offers Hokkien 1 (Chn 8) and Hokkien 2 (Chn 9) as electives. Chiang Kai Shek College offers Hokkien classes in their CKS Language Center.  Linguistic features  The contractions, (sam/sap) and (liaÃçp), used on a grave tablet in the alt= Philippine Hokkien is largely derived from the Jinjiang dialect of Quanzhou but has possibly also absorbed influences from the Amoy dialect of Xiamen and Nan'an dialects of Quanzhou. Although Philippine Hokkien is generally mutually comprehensible with any Hokkien variant, including Taiwanese Hokkien, the numerous English and Filipino loanwords as well as the extensive use of colloquialisms (even those which are now unused in China) can result in confusion among Hokkien speakers from outside of the Philippines. Some terms have been shortened into one syllable. Examples include: *dƒ´-tsaÃçp/lƒ´-tsaÃçp () > diaÃçp/liaÃçp ( / ): twenty; 20 (same format for 20-29, i.e. ‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏Ä[21] is \\"diaÃçp-it\\" Âªø‰∏Ä) *sa‚Åø-tsaÃçp () > sap (): thirty; 30 (same format for 30-39, i.e. ‰∏âÂçÅ‰∫å[32] is \\"saÃçp-dƒ´\\" ÂçÖ‰∫å) *s√¨-tsaÃçp () > siap (): forty; 40 (same format for 40-49, i.e. ÂõõÂçÅ‰∏â[43] is \\"siap-sa‚Åø\\" Âçå‰∏â) =Vocabulary= Philippine Hokkien, like other Southeast Asian variants of Hokkien (e.g. Singaporean Hokkien, Penang Hokkien, Johor Hokkien and Medan Hokkien), has borrowed words from other languages spoken locally, specifically Tagalog and English. Examples include: * manis : \\"corn\\", from Tagalog '''' * lettuce : \\"lettuce\\", from English ' + Hokkien (\\"vegetable\\") * pamkin : \\"pumpkin\\", from English '''' Philippine Hokkien also has some vocabulary that is unique to it compared to other varieties of Hokkien: * : \\"chauffeur\\" * : \\"country bumpkin\\" * : \\"cemetery\\" (used in the sign for Manila Chinese Cemetery) * : \\"potato\\" * : \\"bread\\" * : \\"hospital\\" See also *Mandarin Chinese in the Philippines *PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´ *Taiwanese Romanization System *Holopedia *Speak Hokkien Campaign *Riau Hokkien References Further reading * - An analysis and facsimile of the Arte de la Lengua Chio-chiu (1620), the oldest extant grammar of Hokkien. * - Hokkien translation of the Doctrina Christiana. * - A manual for learning Hokkien written by a Spanish missionary in the Philippines.

Based in the firm's New York City office, Sullivan chairs its national appellate practice group. She is the first and only female name partner at an Am Law 100 law firm. Previously, Sullivan served as Dean of Stanford Law School, where she was the Stanley Morrison Professor of Law. Biography =Early life and education= Born in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan, and raised on Long Island, New York, Sullivan graduated from Cold Spring Harbor High School in 1972. She participated in the Telluride Association Summer Program during high school, then attended Cornell University, where she was a member of the Telluride House, and graduated in 1976. She then became a Marshall Scholar at Wadham College, Oxford, and graduated in 1978. Sullivan returned to the United States to attend Harvard Law School. Professor Laurence Tribe called her, at the time, \\"the most extraordinary student I had ever had.\\" During law school, Sullivan worked as a research assistant to Tribe and assisted him with his Supreme Court appeals. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1981, Sullivan served one year as a judicial law clerk to Judge James L. Oakes on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Following her clerkship, Sullivan elected against joining a large law firm, and instead returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a litigation associate in Professor Tribe's private appellate practice. =Academic career= Although several major law schools offered her positions, Sullivan accepted an assistant professorship at Harvard in 1984, and was promoted to professor of law in 1989.\\"Kathleen M. Sullivan  Biography\\" Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. 6 July 2015. Following a visiting teaching position at Stanford Law School in spring 1992, Sullivan accepted an offer to join that faculty in 1993 and was promoted to the Stanley Morrison Professor of Law in 1996. Sullivan served as Dean of Stanford Law School from 1999 to 2004, becoming the first woman to head any of Stanford's seven schools and the first woman Dean at one of the nation's top three law schools. After voluntarily stepping down as Dean in 2004 to serve part-time as the inaugural director of the Stanford Constitutional Law Center, Sullivan remained on Stanford Law's faculty until 2012. Stanford recruited New York University Law School assistant dean and legal scholar Larry Kramer to succeed her as Dean, as well as serve as Richard E. Lang Professor at the Law School. Sullivan specializes in constitutional law and co-edited a leading casebook with the late Stanford Law professor Gerald Gunther, Constitutional Law, through its 17th edition. She has co-edited the 18th and 19th editions with Noah Feldman. From 2000 to 2007, Sullivan was the sixth most-cited constitutional law scholar, and the most-cited female legal scholar between 2005 and 2009. She is an elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. =Appellate career= While Stanford's Dean, Sullivan maintained a pro bono constitutional law practice. In 2005, she joined Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver & Hedges (now Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan), where she helped to found and build the firm's nascent appellate practice. Now chair of the firm's national appellate practice, Sullivan has argued and briefed numerous appeals before the U.S. Courts of Appeals, the California Supreme Court, the New York Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court, where she has argued nine times.

It was first published in France in 1802, after Chateaubriand had taken advantage of the amnesty Napoleon issued to √©migr√©s, which had allowed him to return to his home country in 1800. Napoleon, who had just signed the Concordat with the pope, initially made use of Chateaubriand's book as propaganda to win support among French Catholics. Within five years, he would quarrel with the author and send him into internal exile. In The Genius of Christianity, Chateaubriand defends the wisdom and beauty of Christianity against the attacks on it by French Enlightenment philosophers and revolutionary politicians. The book had an immense influence on nineteenth-century culture and not just on religious life. In fact, it might be said its greatest impact was on art and literature: it was a major inspiration for the Romantic movement. Work The book emerged from Chateaubriand's attempt to understand the causes of the French Revolution, which had led to the deaths of many of his friends and family members. Sometime in the late 1790s, Chateaubriand had reverted to the Catholic faith of his childhood. He felt that France had lost its way during the Enlightenment period, when leading intellectuals, such as Voltaire, were hostile to traditional religion. In the work, Chateaubriand aims to prove \\"Christianity comes from God, because it is excellent\\". With that objective in mind, he is particularly interested in the artistic contributions of the Christian religion, comparing them with ancient and pagan civilizations. The principal theme of the book is that \\"only Christianity is able to explain progress in arts and letters\\". Chateaubriand accuses the writers of the eighteenth century of misunderstanding God. He makes an exception for Jean- Jacques Rousseau, who had \\"a shadow of religion\\". For Chateaubriand, Voltaire is an inferior playwright to Jean Racine because Voltaire was not a Christian. Structure and contents Chateaubriand divided G√©nie du christianisme into four parts: *Part One: Dogmas and Doctrine. Divided into six books: Mysteries and Sacraments; Virtues and Moral Laws; Truth of the Scriptures, the Fall of Man; Truth of the Scriptures (Continued), Objections against the Moral System of Moses; the Existence of God proved by the Marvels of Nature: Immortality of the Soul, proved by Morals and Sentiments. *Part Two: The Poetry of Christianity. Divided into five books: General Survey of Christian Epics; Poetry in Relation to Human Characters; Poetry in Relation to Human Passions (Continued); On the Marvellous, or Poetry in Relation to Supernatural Beings; the Bible and Homer. *Part Three: Fine Arts and Literature. Divided into five books: Fine Arts; Philosophy; History; Eloquence; Harmonies of the Christian Religion with Scenes of Nature and the Passions of the Human Heart. *Part Four: Ritual. Divided into six books: Churches, Ornaments, Singing, Prayers, Solemnities, etc.; Tombs; General Survey of the Clergy; Missions; Military Orders or Chivalry; Services Rendered to Society by the Clergy and the Christian Religion in General. The original edition of G√©nie du christianisme also contained two novellas by Chateaubriand, Ren√© and Atala, both of them romantic tales about American Indians. The novellas had already been published separately. Together with the related story Les Natchez, which went unpublished until 1827, these books continued to bring fame to Chateaubriand throughout his life. Influence G√©nie du christianisme had a considerable influence on the history of literary and religious ideas in nineteenth-century France. Written in a Classical style, but early Romantic in sensibility, it glorified new sources of inspiration, such as Gothic architecture and the great epics of the Middle Ages. Many critics consider Chateaubriand's vivid powers of description to have worn better than the strength of his philosophical arguments. As David Cairns writes: \\"Beyond its specific purpose, G√©nie du christianisme set a current of sympathy flowing between the author and a whole generation of young French men and women, kindling their imaginations over a wide range of feelings and ideas: the power of the great epic writers, Nature in its immense diversity and grandeur, the poetry of ruins, the spell of the distant past, the beauty of immemorial popular rituals and the haunting melancholy of the music accompanying them, the pangs of awakening consciousness and the perils and ardours of the solitary adolescent soul. More than any other work, it was the primer of early French Romanticism\\". Besides this, the book served as a model for the renewal of French Catholicism, inspiring numerous authors, including Dom Gu√©ranger and F√©licit√© Robert de Lamennais.

In the eastern part of the reserve there are beaches and artificial rocky protection works with important Posidonia oceanica meadows. The area is an ideal refuge for the different species of fish in the area. Although there are development projects near the western part, the protected beaches are only used for recreational activities. The coastal waters of the reserve are closed to tourism and serve as a place for limited environmental education and as a base for numerous scientific studies.  Tourism  Despite its predominantly residential character, the district includes several hotels, as well as the Sporting Monte-Carlo. The last Monegasque beach accessible to the public is there (since the closure of the \\"Portier\\" beach).

He served as Special Minister of State from 2018 to 2019. He previously served as the Assistant Minister for Home Affairs in the Second Turnbull Ministry from December 2017 to August 2018. Hawke is a member of the Australian House of Representatives representing Mitchell, in north-western metropolitan Sydney, for the Liberal Party of Australia since 2007. Hawke is a former national and state president of the Young Liberals. Early years Hawke's maternal grandparents migrated from Greece in 1953 as part of the post World War II migration to Australia from Europe. Hawke's mother died when he was 10 years old and he was raised by his father. He attended Hills Grammar School then Cumberland High School. Hawke then studied at the University of Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts and a Masters in Government and Public Affairs. At university he joined the Australian Army Reserve and served for six years, commissioning into the Royal Australian Armoured Corps and serving as a lieutenant with the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers. Hawke was raised as an Anglican, but on 3 September 2005, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Mike Carlton described Hawke as an Anglican, and was forced to issue a correction that he was not an Anglican and that Hawke attends Hillsong Church. He is one of a number of ministers in the Morrison Government who are affiliated with Hillsong, including Scott Morrison and Stuart Robert.  Early political career  =Young Liberal Movement= Hawke joined the Liberal Party in 1995, and was elected vice-president of the NSW Division of the Young Liberal Movement in 2001, and became president in 2002. He served on the Liberal Party NSW State Executive from 2002 to 2005, and in 2005 was elected Federal President of the Young Liberal Movement. He remains a member of the Liberal Party campaign Committee, and a Delegate to the Liberal Party State Council. He was one of the orchestraters of the shift to the right for the young Liberals. Hawke briefly worked part-time in the private sector while studying at university in 1998, becoming an assistant-manager for Woolworths in the Hills District. Following graduation, he has exclusively worked as a political advisor, firstly as an electorate officer to Ross Cameron MP, Member for Parramatta. In 2001, he commenced work as an adviser to the Senator Helen Coonan, then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, advising on taxation, superannuation and insurance matters during the time of the HIH liquidation. Hawke has also worked as an adviser to David Clarke MLC and Ray Williams MP. =Early political views= Drawing attention to his political ideology, in 2005 Hawke made it known that he believed the Liberal Party to be the home of conservative values, and claimed that \\"Nobody joins the Liberal Party to be left-wing. If you stand for compulsory student unionism, drug- injecting rooms and lowering the [homosexual] age of consent, you can choose the Greens, Labor or the Democrats.\\" A few months later, Hawke attracted some significant controversy. Former NSW opposition leader John Brogden blamed Hawke for contributing to his downfall by leaking information to the media and political enemies ‚Äì a claim that Hawke denied. The next day on 30 August 2005, Brogden was admitted to hospital after committing an apparent attempt at suicide in his electoral office. Brogden's claims were strongly denied by Hawke, who lied when he stated \\"I have not spoken to a single journalist, on or off the record, about this matter until now and I was not in attendance at the function where Brogden committed these acts. To ascribe any role to me in this embarrassing episode is false and I reject it totally\\". =Preselection= On 16 June 2007, Hawke gained Liberal Party preselection for the seat of Mitchell by a margin of 81 votes to 20 against David Elliott, then deputy chief of the Australian Hotels Association. Paul Blanch, a grazier from Orange, received 8 votes. Alan Cadman, who had been the member for Mitchell since 1974, chose not to contest the preselection, but was later quoted as saying that this was due to \\"relentless branch-stacking within the electorate.\\" After his preselection, The Sydney Morning Herald reported Hawke's comments that he believes that Australia will move increasingly towards an American model of conservatism and that \\"The two greatest forces for good in human history are capitalism and Christianity, and when they're blended it's a very powerful duo.\\" Hawke strongly rejected various reports and allegations that he is a \\"right-wing extremist\\", saying he represents the values of his electorate. Hawke was seen as highly effective in his factional manipulations, and was called by 2GB broadcaster Alan Jones as \\"a cancer on the Liberal Party in NSW\\". ;Split from the Right In 2009 Alex Hawke and supporters left the NSW Right faction of the Liberal Party over disputes over conflicting preselection influences with NSW upper house MP David Clarke. Hawke then proceeded to go into an alliance with the NSW Moderates, ending the right's control over the party. Hawke in the following years used his balance of power position on state executive to coerce the moderates into parachuting factional allies as Liberal Candidates despite the wishes of local branch members. Political career Hawke was elected to Parliament as Member for Mitchell on 24 November 2007. There was a swing against the Liberals of 7.9 points, but Hawke won the seat with 61.6 per cent of the vote on a two-party- preferred basis. In his maiden speech in the House of Representatives, Hawke described his political beliefs as follows: \\"My brand of Liberalism is more interested in what we support than what we oppose. I want not just to resist those things that are harmful but to support those things that are good. I derive no satisfaction from opposing the growth of state sponsored welfare if I cannot fan the spark of family, enterprise, self-reliance and human dignity\\", for which he was praised by Liberal politician Tony Abbott for \\"a splendid maiden speech which managed to combine a robust expression of political philosophy and a hymn of praise to his splendid electorate.\\" Hawke increased his margin at the 2010 federal election. With Gould again running against him, Hawke recorded a swing of 7.9 points and won the seat with 67.2 per cent of the two-party-preferred vote. Hawke called for a conscience vote in Parliament on same-sex marriage in Australia and, despite not supporting same-sex marriage himself, voted for it in Parliament, even though his electorate had recorded a majority 'no' vote in. In September 2015, Hawke was promoted to Assistant Minister to the Treasurer in the First Turnbull ministry. Following the re-election of the Turnbull Government, Hawke served as the Assistant Minister to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection between 19 July 2016 and 20 December 2017. = Part in Morrison's elevation to prime minister = Hawke was a central player in Scott Morrison's rise to prime minister. He was seen as part of Morrison's inner circle along with Steve Irons and Stuart Robert. Hawke was seen as the tactical leader of the effort to unseat Turnbull. After the first unsuccessful ballot, where people were discussing the disorganization of the Dutton challenge, Hawke began mobilising the numbers that he had on behalf of Morrison. By the time the second challenge came on 24 August 2018, Hawke had secured the numbers and the prime ministership for Morrison. There were also claims that Hawke had inside information coming from Bert van Manen, one of the deputy whips, who was also part of Morrison's bible study group. He was subsequently rewarded with a promotion in the ministry. = Political views = Hawke is a personal opponent of same-sex marriage, and in the debate said that he does \\"not hold a view that people should not be treated equally under the law\\". He claimed that the family unit is the bedrock of society and that same sex marriage undermines that. There were conflicting claims as to how Hawke voted for the bill for same sex marriage, with the Murdoch press claiming that he supported it, while the ABC stating that it appeared like he abstained from the vote. Hawke had earlier called for a conscience vote. Through his position in the ministry he has called for closer ties to the Pacific region, and to assist them with development. Hawke said that \\"their prosperity is our prosperity\\". He has supported the shake up of foreign aid which involves a reduction of the foreign aid budget, and according to critics, will allow China more influence in the Pacific region. However these new closer ties did not require further action on climate change despite the calls from Pacific leaders for Australia to reduce their carbon emissions to help the low lying Pacific islands. Hawke has been consistent in his views of limiting the government responses to climate change. In his speeches for the introduction of the Gillard Government's carbon tax, Hawke spoke about the action not being sufficient to affect a meaningful change and therefore should not be done. He has also claimed that no one has done more to negate the effects of regional climate change than Australia, a claim the Pacific nations reject. Hawke declined to intervene as the assistant immigration minister in the case of an intellectually disabled woman who was being cared from in the home by her family in her application for permanent residency. The decision of the immigration department would have meant a return to her country of origin where she had no family and likely institutionalization.  Controversy  In 2018, Hawke said he strongly supported new rules to allow religious schools to expel students who are gay, bisexual or transgender, warning that people of faith were under attack in Australia: \\"I don't think it's controversial in Australia that people expect religious schools to teach the practice of their faith and their religion [...] We‚Äôre mostly talking about the primary system and very very young people who are below the age of consent. So this is a manufactured issue that the left is raising to try and circumvent religious freedom\\". Also in 2018, Buzzfeed News reported that Alex Hawke was outspending high-profile party members Scott Morrison and Tony Abbott on printing services, despite holding a seat by a 21.4% margin. The company responsible for the printing, Zion Graphics, owned no commercial printer but instead outsourced the printing and charged a premium for the service. Zion Graphics was owned by Rudy Limantono, then president of the Bella Vista Liberal party branch and party donor. A defamation claim was made by Limontono, directed at Buzzfeed, which was settled out of court in 2019. Buzzfeed issued an apology, which included a statement clarifying that it had not intended to present Zion Graphics as anything other than a legitimate business. A follow-up investigation by Australian Printer discovered that the 3rd party contractor that Buzzfeed had claimed Zion Graphics procured printing services from, Hills Banners, had never had Zion Graphics as a client or business partner. Hawke accused the first Muslim woman elected to parliament, Egyptian born Anne Aly, of thinking that \\"her diversity as something better than other people's diversity\\". When challenged on these statements, Hawke responded by saying that Labor were \\"feigning outrage and falsely claiming racism\\" in order to shut down debate, and that they were \\"fixated on identity politics and appears constantly triggered by anything and everything\\".  Personal life  Hawke was married to Rebecca Davie, an environmental lawyer. They met in 2003 and married in 2010 before deciding to separate in April 2013. Later in 2013, Hawke married Amiela McManus, a policy advisor for Michael Keenan. Hawke was briefly caught up in the crisis over foreign citizenship in Australian parliament when questions were raised over his eligibility for Greek citizenship through his mother. The matter was resolved without the need for Hawke to be referred to the High Court. Hawke was a member of the Australian Defence Force reserves, rising to the rank of Lieutenant.

It is located roughly in the middle of the area inside the ring-road, and is at the point where five major streets meet; Gallowtree Gate, Humberstone Gate (A47), Haymarket (A607), Church Gate (A6) and Eastgates (A47). Construction Before the construction of the Clock Tower the site had been used for an Assembly Room building, built in 1750, which was re-used and divided as shops in 1805.Wilshere, J.E.O. (1974) Leicester Clock Tower, Leicester Research Services The building came to be considered \\"the Haymarket Obstruction\\" and after a campaign by local property-owners it was demolished in 1862. The hay market on the site remained, however, until it was relocated to Humberstone Gate. The removal of the Assembly Rooms and the hay market left a wide area which pedestrians struggled to cross due to the busy traffic there, and with rumours of an illuminated clock planned for the junction of London Road and Belvoir Street, local businesses began a petition to erect \\"a clock with a cluster of lamps and a fine colossal statue of that unparalleled benefactor Sir Thomas White\\" in the area. An organisation was formed in 1867 to raise funds for the project, led by John Burton, who ran a photography business from a shop adjacent to the site of the tower. Subscriptions were gathered, with further money raised from a concert, and architects were invited to produce designs for \\"an ornamental structure...in height from 35‚Äì40 feet to contain four illuminated dials, four statuettes or medallion busts of ancient benefactors to the town, with a platform around 18 feet square, and lamps as a safeguard to passing pedestrians.\\" 105 designs were received, with a shortlist of three submitted to the town council for consideration, with Joseph Goddard's design being chosen. 472 subscribers contributed a total of 872 pounds, 2 shillings, and 9 pence, with the balance of the 1,200 required provided by the Corporation of Leicester.Cavanagh, Terry & Yarrington, Allison (2000) Public Sculpture of Leicestershire and Rutland, Liverpool University Press, , p. 118 The Clock Tower was constructed in 1868. The tower was built mostly in Ketton stone with a base of Mountsorrel granite, and incorporates column shafts made of polished Peterhead granite and serpentine. The statues were made from Portland stone. The site was directly above the junction of two of the city's main sewers which were modified prior to the tower's construction. Officially a memorial, the Clock Tower has four statues of two persons of particular significance to Leicester and of two notable sons of Leicester, one at each corner, being named on the plinth of each as: Simon de Montfort, Thomas White, William Wyggeston (spelt 'William Wigston' on the plinth on the tower itself) and Gabriel Newton. Development of the area At the time of its construction the traffic in the areas was horse-drawn. Tram lines were installed in the area between 1903 and 1904. Originally a traffic island at a 5-way junction, the Clock Tower was later converted to be the centre-piece of a roundabout, in 1926, one of the first in the UK. There were calls for the tower to be demolished in the 1930s, with increasing traffic in the area, and in the 1960s there were suggestions that it should be relocated to Victoria Park, but despite the major changes that have taken place in the area, including the construction of the Haymarket Shopping Centre and the resulting demolition of many nearby buildings (including John Burton's shop) it has remained. Pedestrianisation has now led to Humberstone Gate and Gallowtree Gate being closed to traffic, and the Clock Tower is now bounded by a road solely on the northern side. Restoration of the tower was undertaken (and substantially funded) in 1992 by architects and engineers Pick Everard to mark the Leicester-based company's 125th anniversary. In the first decade of the 21st century, Leicester City Council unveiled plans to greatly enhance the Clock Tower through extensive de-cluttering to achieve a restored landmark public space at the heart of the city.Leicester City Council ‚Äì Clock Tower/East Gates Leicester City Council ‚Äì Streets & Spaces (Stage 3) ‚Äì Clock Tower and East Gates Construction on the new site was completed in late 2008. On Monday 5 November 2007 both the Leicester Mercury and The Sun printed articles on a hoax petition, set up by local man Luke Anthony Williams. Over 3000 people joined a Facebook group to save the Clock Tower, even though plans to demolish the monument were fictitious: the only evidence that he could provide was a Wikipedia edit made by himself.

Plot  Across the Nightingale Floor is set in a fictional world based on Japan during the Sengoku period, and follows the story of a sixteen-year-old boy named Tomasu and fifteen-year-old girl named Kaede. Tomasu, a member of The Hidden by birth, returns from exploring the mountains to find members of his family slaughtered. Trying to escape he unhorses Iida Sadamu, leader of the Tohan, who led the slaughter of The Hidden. Chased by Iida's men, Tomasu is rescued by Lord Shigeru of the Otori. Shigeru takes Tomasu with him to protect, and later adopts him. However he deems his name unsuitable because of its Hidden roots and renames him Takeo. On the road Takeo loses his voice temporarily and his hearing becomes superhuman. On the journey to Shigeru's home, the two stop at an inn where they meet Maruyama Naomi, a powerful female ruler from the Seishuu. Lady Maruyama is found to have been against the persecution of the Hidden and urges Takeo to tell her about the slaughter. At night, when Takeo is in his room, he overhears Lady Maruyama and Shigeru expressing their love for one another. Eventually, the pair reach Lord Shigeru's home in Hagi, where Takeo is received with astonishment by an old maid named Chiyo and Shigeru's ex- instructor, Ichiro. Takeo is slowly accepted by the household and is later adopted as Shigeru's son, under the condition that Shigeru marries Shirakawa Kaede, the most beautiful maiden in the Three Countries. However, Takeo is under the threat of Shigeru's uncles' sons, who try to murder him during practice every day. Later, Takeo meets Muto Kenji (also known as the Fox), the master of the Muto clan, who reveals to him that Takeo's father was the most skilled assassin of the Kikuta, the greatest family of the Tribe. Kenji, after informing Takeo of this, starts to train him in the arts of the Tribe. In autumn, Takeo sneaks out of the house one day and explores Hagi, where he meets a merchant who he'd saved when he was one of the Hidden. The merchant, recognizing him, calls him by his real name. Takeo denies it and flees. When the time comes, Shigeru and Takeo and others start preparing their trip to Tsuwano where they would meet Shigeru's future wife, Shirakawa Kaede. At Tsuwano they meet Kaede (who has been held hostage by the Noguchi since she was seven and forced to sleep in the maid's rooms. She has been constantly harassed by the guards who wanted to have her. Not long before she had reached Tsuwano, a guard had tried to rape her, only to be stabbed with a knife). She is under the protection of her kinswoman Lady Maruyama (with whom Shigeru has had a secret relationship for almost ten years), and is accompanied by Kenji's niece, Shizuka, who is half Muto and half Kikuta. But it is Takeo and Kaede who immediately find a connection between them. They stop at the shrine at Terayama, at the time of the Festival of the Dead, to visit the grave of Shigeru's brother, Takeshi, and for Shigeru to discuss war plans with the Abbott. As an army headed by Lord Arai musters from the west, they arrive at Inuyama in the 9th month. Shigeru plans for Takeo to assassinate Iida that night, but the Tribe, not wanting to risk Takeo (and appreciating the stability that Iida brings), abducts him so that his training can be finished. Thus the treachery plays itself out: Shigeru is crucified on the castle wall, and Lady Maruyama and her daughter drown whilst attempting to escape. Takeo makes a deal with the Tribe that allows him to bring Shigeru's body down in return for joining them. Takeo, together with Kenji and Yuki, sneaks into the castle at night and bring Shigeru down from the wall. Shigeru, dying from his wounds, asks Takeo to bury him at Terayama, next to his brother's grave. Then Takeo decapitates him in order to end his pain. During the invasion of the castle at Inuyama, Takeo discovers Kaede with the corpse of Iida Sadamu, whom she had killed when he attempted to rape her; the two of them make love. After carrying out Shigeru's wishes and killing the other Tohan lords, Takeo honors his promise to the Tribe and departs with them just as Arai and his army arrive, leaving Kaede unconscious from his Kikuta Stare and in the care of Muto Shizuka.

The events in the novel cover a period of approximately 6 months (from Autumn through to Spring the next year), following directly after those in Across the Nightingale Floor. Plot summary Kaede slowly recovers from the Kikuta sleep given to her by Takeo, with dreams of the White Goddess: Be patient. He will come for you. Afterwards she travels towards home, accompanied by Shizuka. Arai is furious that Takeo has gone off with the Tribe, and realizes that he had underestimated them. He sends his men to search for him, and to assassinate Shizuka, his ex-lover whom he now fears because of her association with the Tribe. However, the attempt fails. Kaede is pregnant with Takeo's child, but Shizuka creates the notion of a secret marriage with Shigeru before his death to explain the coming child. Meanwhile, Takeo is kept hidden inside a Tribe house in Yamagata. Kikuta Akio, one of his abductors, is charged with teaching him, despite their mutual hatred. Under the disguise of traveling acrobats, they head north to Matsue. Yuki, Kenji's daughter, enters a relationship with Takeo as directed to by the Tribe, though she has genuine affection for him. One day she leaves suddenly, pregnant with his child, whom the tribe hope will inherit Takeo's extraordinary abilities. Kaede returns to her childhood home to find the estate in disrepair, her mother dead, and her father in despair after losing a battle to Arai and not having the courage to take his own life. She determines, despite her gender, to take over Shirakawa. She attracts the interest of an Imperial noble who lives nearby, Lord Fujiwara, who assists her in return for hearing her secrets. Makoto, a monk from Terayama, visits and accidentally reveals that there was no marriage between Kaede and Shigeru. In disgrace, her father decides their whole family must take their lives, and attacks Kaede. Shizuka and Kondo (a retainer, and member of the tribe) rescue her by killing him. Kaede goes into labour, miscarries her child, and becomes gravely ill. The Tribe become frustrated with Takeo's disobedience, and send him on a mission as a last chance. They believe Shigeru compiled records on the Tribe, so Takeo goes to his old house with Akio to retrieve them‚ÄîTakeo being the only one who could get across the nightingale floor without being detected. Takeo discovers the records are at Terayama, but decides to escape from the Tribe. He shakes off Akio, and makes his way south, with winter closing in.

Many must die, but you yourself are safe from death, except at the hands of your own son.\\" He reaches Terayama the last day before the pass is closed by snow. Once Spring thaws the snow, Kaede excuses herself from Fujiwara, stating her intention to visit Arai, her overlord, to discuss her future. He reluctantly agrees, and she travels via Terayama, as she has heard that Takeo is there. They meet, and as Takeo is under a death sentence from the Tribe, Kaede sends Shizuka and Kondo away. Against advice, Takeo and Kaede marry at Terayama.

A period of about 8 months is covered, from Spring to the onset of Winter. Plot summary Soon after Kaede and Takeo's marriage, messengers arrive at Terayama from his Uncles with a threat, and the head of Ichiro, his old teacher. The Otori army lies in wait to ambush him, so Takeo leads them over the mountains, and across the river near Kibi, with the assistance of a bridge made by Jo-an and some outcasts. His second-in-command is the homosexual monk Makoto, a friend of his from Terayama; Makoto criticizes many of Takeo's unorthodox methods, but nonetheless is very loyal to him. After a minor skirmish with some bandits, they lead the army to Maruyama, the domain that Lady Maruyama left to Kaede. Lady Maruyama's son-in-law, Iida Nariaki, a cousin to Iida Sadamu, has marched in to Maruyama just ahead of them, but Iida's army gets caught between the Maruyama and Takeo's armies, and are defeated.

They decide to send Kondo to Arai, to gauge his reaction to Kaede's marriage, and his feeling towards his sons by Shizuka. Kenji also tells her how his daughter Yuki was recently married to Akio, but was forced to take her life after her son by Takeo was born, because the Kikuta were suspicious of her love for Takeo. The child will remain with the Kikuta, who have their own plans concerning the boy and Takeo's futures. Kenji's grief at his daughter's death has caused him to split from the Kikuta; regretful of his betrayal of Shigeru, he now tries to rally the other families of the Tribe to help Takeo. In Maruyama, they start restoring the land and estates. Takeo is threatened by the local Tribe members, so using Shigeru's records, he has them rounded up and the adults executed.

Kaede wants to accompany him, but he tells her to stay. On the way he meets Ryoma, an illegitimate son of his Uncle, Masahiro. He makes an agreement with Fumio's father, but his return is delayed by typhoons, and he almost drowns in a storm. Despite Sugita's objections, Kaede rides to Shirakawa with Hiroshi, and finds that Shoji, the Shirakawa retainer, had given up her sisters to Fujiwara, and returned her hostage to his family. Shocked, she hides the records on the Tribe at the nearby Shrine, and rides to demand her sisters return. Fujiwara abducts her, and only Hiroshi escapes to later bring the news to Maruyama. Fujiwara declares her marriage to Takeo to be illegal, and he forces her to marry him. Their marriage is celibate: he is not interested in her as a woman, but as a treasure, to be locked away, well-cared for but not given any information. However, one of Shizuka's cousins manages to bring Kaede messages for a time- until Fujiwara discovers her and has her murdered. Takeo returns and hears the news of Kaede's abduction. His army marches towards Shirakawa, but discovers not only Fujiwara's garrison, but Arai's larger army. Caught between them, Takeo is defeated but manages to extract his forces. They retreat to the coast as Maruyama surrenders to Arai's men, hoping for Fumio to come by boat, but the weather delays him. Takeo submits to Arai, but rather than killing him, they enter into an alliance against the Otori lords (Shigeru's uncles), but to dispel rumors about him being one of the hidden, Takeo is forced to kill the outcast Jo-an. Kenji, turned against the Kikuta because of the murder of his daughter, comes to Takeo and brings a truce, and an alliance on behalf of the Tribe, save the Kikuta. Before they leave, Fumio demonstrates to Takeo the use of a firearm, an invention obtained from the white barbarians. Arai's army marches north, and Takeo sails around the coast to Hagi. With Kenji and Taku, Arai and Shizuka's younger son, they sneak into the castle, and kill the lords and their families. When Arai's army arrives, he betrays Takeo; he intended to use Takeo to take out the Otori Lords for him, removing the last obstacle to his total rule of the Three Countries. Enraged, Takeo threatens to kill Arai's sons Zenko and Taku (who are standing next to him) which makes Arai pause. Fumio shoots Arai dead with the firearm, and at that moment a huge earthquake rocks the entire three countries. It destroys Arai's army, and in Shirakawa it destroys Fujiwara and his household in an example of Deus ex machina. Kondo Kiichi, in a last act of loyalty to Kaede, sacrifices himself to hold Fujiwara inside his burning house. However, Kaede's oiled hair accidentally catches fire. The Kikuta master, Kotaro, sneaks into Takeo's house to assassinate him, as he did to his father years before. With Kenji and Taku's help, they defeat him, but Takeo loses 2 fingers, and goes into a delirium from the poisoned blade that cut him. After he recovers, and despite the onset of winter, he rushes south to find what happened to Kaede. Makoto, his longtime friend, decides to leave him, but promises to continue to pray for him and for all his people at the temple They come to the shrine to find Kaede, Shizuka, and her new husband Dr Ishida alive, with the tribal records safe. But Kaede's hair is shorn, terrible burns marring her neck; Takeo gently covers her scars with his maimed hand. As it starts to snow, Takeo prays the spring would bring healing to their lands and their marriage. Afterword A short epilogue, 15 years after the events of the book, closes off the trilogy, and sets the scene for the sequel, The Harsh Cry of the Heron. Takeo is co-ruler of the Three Countries with Kaede, and they have three daughters. He has not told Kaede of his son by Yuki, and knows if his destiny is to die at his hands, he cannot avoid it.

It is in the south-west of the Redcliffe peninsula, approximately north- northeast of Brisbane, the state capital. It was named after Clontarf in Ireland.  Geography  Clontarf is connected to Brisbane City, across Bramble Bay, by the Houghton Highway which is a 2.7 km long causeway that provides access to the southern tip of Redcliffe City, greatly decreasing the travel time between Redcliffe and Brisbane. The current pair of bridges, Houghton Highway and its twin Ted Smout Memorial Bridge, replaced the original Hornibrook Bridge which is now closed and mostly demolished. The land use is a mix of residential and light industrial.  History  In 1881,108 allotments at Hayes Inlet Estate, Humpy Bong of what is now Clontarf were offered for sale. The Clontarf estate went to auction on 26 September 1882. The sale was widely advertised including a coloured lithograph, showing the sub-division of Dr Ward's sugar plantation and using references to the city of Redcliffe \\"in the near future\\" and a regular steam ferry service between Sandgate and Clontarf within months in the newspaper advertisements. The success which attended this sale of the Clontarf Estate led to Clontarf North sale in December 1882. St Barnabas' Anglican Church was dedicated on 5 July 1959 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. In the 1990s it was decided to combine the congregations of St Barbanas' and St Mark's in Woody Point into a new St Peter the Fisherman's Anglican Church at Clontarf. This led to the closure of St Mark's on 24 April 1993 which was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning. This resulted in the closure of St Barnabas circa 1992. St Peter the Fisherman's was dedicated in 1993 and consecrated in 1996. In the , Clontarf recorded a population of 7,911 people, 50.2% female and 49.8% male. The median age of the Clontarf population was 42 years, 5 years above the national median of 37. 76.2% of people living in Clontarf were born in Australia. The other top responses for country of birth were New Zealand 5.5%, England 5.2%, Scotland 0.8%, Philippines 0.8%, South Africa 0.5%. 90.7% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 0.4% Tagalog, 0.4% German, 0.3% Dutch, 0.3% Italian, 0.3% Samoan. Heritage listings Clontarf has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Hornibrook Highway: Hornibrook Bridge (the first of the three bridges) Industry Evening peak traffic flow into Clontarf Clontarf's west hosts the largest industrial area in the Redcliffe area, and the area is a significant source of employment for the region. Many residents of Clontarf also commute to Brisbane daily for work. Commuters also travel to Brisbane by Train, as there is now a Train line that connects to the peninsula. Clontarf is host to two adjacent medium-sized shopping centres, on the southern tip of the suburb. Most retail commerce in the suburb revolves around small business however, and there are many stand alone corner stores and other small businesses still in existence. Aussie Traveller, the largest caravan awning/annexe company in Australia now call Clontarf home Education Several educational institutions are located within Clontarf: Clontarf Beach State High School, which opened in 1964 and has over 1240 enrolled students, Clontarf Beach State School (1950) with approximately 350 students, and a private school, Grace Lutheran Primary School (1971), with approximately 430 students.

In 2017 Light Fingers was inducted to the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. Background The lightly built chestnut was by the highly successful sire of stayers, Le Filou, from Cuddlesome by Red Mars (GB), by Hyperion (GB). She was originally called Close Embrace in New Zealand, but the Australian registrar wouldn't allow that name to be used. Trained by Bart Cummings, Light Fingers would become the first of his 12 Melbourne Cup winners. On a visit to New Zealand, Cummings had tried to buy the filly, but was unsuccessful. He did however manage to lease the horse, which would go on to carry the greatest weight to victory, by a mare, to that date. Racing career Light Fingers had her first race on Boxing Day in 1963 at the Port Adelaide Racing Club's track at Cheltenham, where she ran second over 5 furlongs. She won her next three starts, two at Adelaide, and one at Flemington, before being sent for a spell. In her three year old year, Light Fingers won 7 races from 12 starts. She won all of the important fillies' races that year, save the One Thousand Guineas, where she was beaten by Reveille. The mare won her first race as a four year old, and won the Craiglee Stakes over a mile early in the spring of 1965. The rest of Light Fingers' lead up to the Melbourne Cup was filled with obstacles. First, she suffered a virus, and then she injured her shoulder in a near fall in the Caulfield Stakes. The injury prevented her from running in the Caulflield Cup, and raised doubts about whether she would make the start of the Melbourne Cup. Her regular rider, Roy Higgins, was unsure about whether he should keep the ride, but eventually chose to stick with the mare, saying 'my filly is so good that if she gets to the post she might just win, and if she does it would break my heart not to be on her'. Light Fingers pulled up well after her final lead up run in the Mackinnon Stakes, and following a cortisone injection by vet Percy Sykes, started in the Melbourne Cup at odds of 15/1. Fifth into the straight, Light Fingers ranged up to stablemate Ziema at the furlong. The two horses hit the line together, with the camera giving Light Fingers the victory by half a head. Higgins, who rode Light Fingers in the majority of her big wins, was quoted as saying after her Melbourne Cup victory, that as Light Fingers and her stablemate Ziema worked together leading up to the '65 Cup, Higgins felt that when the mare ranged up alongside the big striding Ziema, he seemed to take a look at her and turn it up. Higgins went on to state. \\"In the last few strides, however, she seemed to sense that something extra was needed. I could feel her gathering herself and she fairly dived for the winning post. I only had to wave the whip at her. I didn't want to hit her. She was giving all she had.\\" Following her Melbourne Cup win, Light Fingers ran second to stablemate Galilee, one of the great stayers of the decade, in that race the following year.  Breeding Career  Light Fingers had an unremarkable breeding career. Her foals were: * Her Boy, a chestnut colt by Agricola, foaled in 1969 * An unnamed bay colt by Alcimedes, foaled in 1972 * Nimble Fingers, a brown filly by Alcimedes, foaled in 1973 * Slick, a bay filly by Zephyr Bay, foaled in 1977 * An unnamed bay filly by Decies, foaled in 1978 * Nimble Touch, a chestnut colt by Smuggler, foaled in 1981 * Nimble Princess, a bay filly by Princes Gate, foaled in 1984 References 1961 racehorse births 1988 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in New Zealand Racehorses trained in Australia Melbourne Cup winners Thoroughbred family 20-a ","title":"Light Fingers"},{"id":"2830314","text":"Red Handed was a New-Zealand bred, Australian-trained Thoroughbred racehorse, who won the 1967 Melbourne Cup.

With the fastest circumnavigation time towards the end of the race, Moitessier was the likely winner for the fastest voyage, but he elected to continue on to Tahiti and not return to the start line in England, rejecting the idea of the commercialization of long distance sailing. He was a French national born and raised in Vietnam, then part of French Indochina. Vagabond of the South Seas Moitessier grew up next to the sea in Indochina, at the time a French colony which included Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. He left Indochina at the beginning of the Vietnam War as a crew member of sailing trade junks. In Indonesia he purchased the dilapidated junk Marie-Th√©r√®se in 1952 to travel slowly further to France by singlehanded sailing. On the first leg to Seychelles he had to stop her from leaking in the middle of the Indian Ocean by diving underneath the boat at sea. After 85 days of sailing through monsoon weather he ran aground on Diego Garcia. He did not have modern navigational instruments, and was aware of his latitude via sextant observation but was estimating longitude and, as he tells it in \\"Sailing to the Reefs\\", neglected a three-knot ocean current, leading to the grounding. He was provided a berth on a supply ship travelling to and from Mauritius island, as Diego Garcia at the time was run by a private company based in Mauritius, and in Mauritius he worked there three years before he could sail again in a boat he had built himself. This he sailed via stops in South Africa and St. Helena to the West Indies, but on a trip from Trinidad to St. Lucia he once again was shipwrecked due to physical exhaustion. Picked up and taken back to Trinidad by friends, he decided to go to France directly, as it seemed the only place he could earn enough to build himself a worthy boat. He was able to get work on a cargo ship which got him to France, via Hamburg, where he found work with a medical company whilst writing a book about his experience (Vagabond des Mers du Sud). He then moved to the south of France, where he married Fran√ßoise, the daughter of family friends, with whom he was to sail the world. With the money from his book, he commissioned a 39' steel ketch which he named Joshua, in honour of Joshua Slocum, the first person to sail around the world solo. Finally he and Fran√ßoise left Marseille in October 1963, leaving her three children in boarding schools. After wintering in Casablanca they sailed first to the Canaries, then to Trinidad, and through the Panama Canal to the Galapagos Islands. After two years of spending time in each of these places they arrived at Tahiti, but realised that they were running out of time and that there was just eight months left to return to their children. So Moitessier proposed sailing Joshua home not via the Indian Ocean and Suez Canal, as originally planned, but eastward, via the quickest route, including a passage about the much feared Cape Horn. Upon their arrival in France, at Easter, 1966, they had, without intending it, completed the longest nonstop passage by a yacht in history‚Äî14216 nautical miles, over 126 days, a world record which brought him immediate recognition throughout the world yachting community. Solo around the world Voyage of Joshua ‚Äì \\"The long route\\" Discussions between Moitessier and his friends Bill King and Lo√Øck Fougeron about a solo non-stop trip around the world came to the notice of Robin Knox-Johnston who also started preparations before the Sunday Times offered their Golden Globe award for the first to circumnavigate alone, nonstop, and unassisted, and for the fastest elapsed time. Somewhat reluctantly, Moitessier decided to sail Joshua to Plymouth to meet the criterion for the race of leaving from an English port, but left months after several smaller and therefore slower boats. He departed Plymouth on August 23, 1968 and, after a quick passage south, he was off the Cape of Good Hope by October 20, 1968. In the process of transferring a canister of film and reports for the Sunday Times to a freighter, he allowed the bow of Joshua to be drawn into the stern of the ship, bending the bowsprit, which he was able to fix with winches on board. A couple of days later Joshua was knocked flat by a breaking wave but he was able to recover the damage. A succession of gales and calm periods characterised his trip through the Southern Ocean till he passed Cape Horn on 5 Feb 1969. In all this time he got no feedback on the progress of other competitors from local radio stations. From the time of calms in the Indian Ocean where he was depressed and discovered yoga as a means of controlling his moods, he started to think of not returning to Europe which he saw as a cause of many of his worries. The aim of continuing his voyage on again to the Galapagos Islands strengthened as he passed through the Pacific though he was determined to complete the circumnavigation first. Finally having passed Cape Horn he had a crisis when a south-easterly gale started blowing him north again, and his account of his thought processes before he turned for the Cape of Good Hope reflects inner turmoil. However, the manner of his resignation, as he tells the story, is a key part of his reputation. He sent a message to his London Times correspondent by firing message by slingshot onto the deck of a passing ship, stating: \\"parce que je suis heureux en mer et peut-√™tre pour sauver mon √¢me\\" (\\"because I am happy at sea and perhaps to save my soul\\"). The decision to abandon is instructive of Moitessier's character. Although driven and competitive, he passed up a chance at instant fame and a world record, and sailed on for three more months. Sir Robin Knox-Johnston went on both to win the race, as its only legitimate finisher, and to become the first man to circumnavigate the globe alone without stopping. Moitessier's boat Joshua in 2006 in La Rochelle. Although he abandoned the race, Moitessier still circumnavigated the globe, crossing around the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa, and then sailing almost two-thirds of the way around a second time, all non-stop and mostly in the roaring forties, setting another record for the longest nonstop passage by a yacht, with a total of 37,455 nautical miles in 10 months. Despite heavy weather and a couple of severe knockdowns, he even contemplated rounding the Horn again. However, he decided that he and Joshua had had enough and, on June 21, 1969, put in at Tahiti, from where he and his wife had set out for Alicante, Spain, a decade earlier. He thus had completed his second personal circumnavigation of the world, including the previous voyage with his wife. It is impossible to say whether Moitessier would have won if he had completed the race, as he would have been sailing in different weather conditions than Knox-Johnston. Based on his time from the start to Cape Horn being about 77% of that of Knox-Johnston, it would have been an extremely close race. However Moitessier is on record as stating that he would not have won. Moitessier's book of the experience, The Long Way, tells the story of his voyage as a spiritual journey as much as a sailing adventure and is still regarded as a classic of sailing and adventuring literature. Subsequent life Moitessier's grave in Le Bono, Morbihan, France (photographed in 2004) Moitessier's grave in Le Bono, Morbihan, France (photographed in 2010) It took Moitessier two years to finish the book about his trip to Tahiti, during which time he met Ileana Draghici with whom he had a son, Stephan. They moved to the atoll of Ahe, where Moitessier attempted to cultivate fruit and vegetables. Ileana encouraged him to move to America to complete films about his sailing but he left after two years in his boat Joshua. =Wreck of the 'Joshua'= In December 1982 Moitessier was offered a yacht charter by film actor Klaus Kinski as Kinski was to star in a sailing film and wanted some experience. They sailed from San Francisco to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico and anchored off the beach. In a freak onshore storm Joshua dragged her anchor, was hit and dis-masted by another yacht, Frieling, and then beached along with 25 other yachts. Joshua lay on the beach, damaged and filled with sand. Moitessier and crews from other yachts spent days digging a trench but the salvage costs were too great so he sold the wreck to Reto Filli (Swiss) and Jo Daubenberger (USA) for $20. On a full moon high tide, a trawler towed and a bulldozer pushed the yacht back into the sea and she floated free. Later Paul Clements and Johanna Slee bought the yacht and she ended up in Port Townsend, Washington. In 1990 'Joshua' was sold by Slee and is now restored and berthed at the Maritime Museum in La Rochelle, France. After further travels, Moitessier returned to Paris to write his autobiography, Tamata and the Alliance. Moitessier was an environmental activist who protested against nuclear weapons in the South Pacific and against overdevelopment of the Papeete waterfront in Tahiti. Death Moitessier died of prostate cancer on June 16, 1994 and is buried in an informal corner of the main cemetery in Bono, in Brittany, France. Visitors to his grave leave thematic gifts such as slingshots, creating some elements of a shrine. Partial list of works *Un Vagabond des mers du sud 1960.

In 2011, he received the Gittler Award from the American Psychological Association for significant contributions to the philosophical foundations of Psychology. \\"  Primary interests  Robinson‚Äôs interests ranged over the brain sciences, philosophy, law and intellectual history. Several of his works were illustrative of these interests. Regarded as a classic in its field, his An Intellectual History of Psychology was praised by Ernest Hilgard for its ‚Äú‚Ä¶development of ideas as they provide alternative perspectives on the nature of mind‚Ä¶The reader is carried along on a genuine intellectual adventure.\\" Robinson‚Äôs enduring interest in Aristotle‚Äôs thought was summarized in Aristotle‚Äôs Psychology, which Deborah Modrak described as ‚ÄúEasy to read and informative‚Äù predicting that it would ‚Äúno doubt prompt readers to reflect on the relevance of Aristotle‚Äôs work to modern psychology‚Ä¶‚Äù (International Studies in Philosophy, Volume 23, Issue 3, 1991; pp. 142‚Äì143). In this connection, Robinson was among the small group assembled by Martin Seligman in 1999 to develop the framework for Positive Psychology. In Wild Beasts and Idle Humours, Robinson offered a treatise on the relationship between science and jurisprudence as this developed from ancient to contemporary times. Michael Perlin describes the book as ‚Äútruly unique. It synthesizes material that I do not believe has ever been considered in this context, and links up the historical past with contemporaneous values and politics. Robinson effortlessly weaves religious history, literary history, medical history, and political history, and demonstrates how the insanity defense cannot be fully understood without consideration of all these sources.‚Äù Robert Kinscherff states that it ‚Äú‚Ä¶reads like the inner workings of a fascinating and disciplined narrative mind.‚Äù Robinson‚Äôs major work in moral philosophy was Praise and Blame: Moral Realism and Its Application. Reviewing the book in Review of Metaphysics, Jude P. Dougherty writes, ‚ÄúThe richness of this work cannot be comprehended in one reading. Whether the reader agrees or not with the author, one has much to learn from the profundity of Robinson's insight into the framing of moral judgment‚Äù. (Rev. Metaphys., 2003, vol. 56, 899-900.) Central to Robinson‚Äôs concerns were the conceptual and philosophical foundations of psychology and related subjects. Of Robinson‚Äôs Philosophy of Psychology, William Dray wrote that ‚Äúthis highly readable book squarely addresses fundamental metaphysical, epistemological and methodological problems‚Ä¶His clear and informed treatment‚Ä¶offers salutary challenge to much conventional wisdom on the nature and prospects of psychological science.‚Äù  Selected published works  ;Books  * Eccles, John C. and Robinson, Daniel N.

The origin of the dish is claimed by both the Southern regions of Campania and Sicily. Other variations found outside Italy may include chicken, veal, or another type of meat cutlet or vegetable filling.  History  There are several theories about the origin of the dish. Most frequently its invention is attributed to either Parma, Sicily or Naples. The case for Parma is that Parmigiana refers to Parma and because Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese is produced there. Sicilian food writers have several different explanations for a Sicilian origin. According to Pino Correnti the word parmigiana derives from the Sicilian word for damigiana, a wicker sleeve used both for wine bottles and the hot casserole in which the dish would be prepared and served. Mary Taylor Simeti, Vincent Schiavelli, and several others write that the name derives from the Sicilian word for louver, palmigiana. The angled horizontal slats of a louver would resemble the layering of eggplant slices in the dish. Franca Colonna Romano Apostolo suggests that the name is parmiciana, which means Persian in Sicilian. Clifford A. Wright argues that the case for Parma is not convincing because Parmigiano-Reggiano was already widely traded since the 14th century. Parmigiano-Reggiano also wasn't an important ingredient in the original dish. Because eggplant was first introduced to Sicily and the other southern regions, it is more likely that an eggplant dish was invented there. Finally, the dish is popular in Campania in general, Naples in particular, as well as Sicily and Calabria, but not in Parma. He considers the case for a Sicilian origin speculative because there is no evidence to support it. Wright traces the origin of parmigiana to Naples. The ancestor of the modern dish appears in Vincenzo Corrado's cookbook Il cuoco galante from 1786. His recipe described eggplant seasoned with butter, herbs, cinnamon, other spices and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, which was then covered with a cream sauce of egg yolks before being baked in an oven. The modern version with Parmigiano-Reggiano and tomato rag√π as key ingredients appears several years later in Ippolito Cavalcanti's cookbook Cucina teorico-pratica which was published in Naples in 1837. According to Wright this suggests that the dish evolved in Naples during this time frame, which coincided with the increasing popularity of the tomato in Italian cuisine. Marlena Spieler agrees with a Neapolitan origin of the dish for the same reasons. Preparation The dish consists of sliced eggplant, pan fried in oil, layered with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. In some versions, the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and dredged in flour or breadcrumbs before frying. Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmigiano, while others use softer melting cheeses like mozzarella, or a combination of these. Italian variations In Naples, Parmigiana is also prepared using zucchini or artichokes in place of eggplants. International variations Variations made with breaded meat cutlets, such as veal and chicken, have been popularized in other countries, usually in areas of Italian immigration. In such areas the original dish may be called eggplant parmigiana to distinguish it from the meat versions. In the United States and Canada, chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana are often served as a main course often with a side of pasta. Chicken parmigiana is also served as the filling of a submarine sandwich. The alternate anglicization Parmesan is sometimes used instead, and the abbreviated form \\"parm\\" is common. The use of meats as an alternate to eggplant originated in the United States, where it was influenced by similar Italian dishes. A similar veal dish is known in Italian as cotoletta alla Bolognese, which excludes tomato sauce but includes melted Parmesan cheese and prosciutto. Costolette Parmigiana is another similar veal dish, but in Italy it is generally served without sauce or cheese. Chicken parmigiana is also a common dish in Australia and is often served with a side of chips or salad. In Australia, where the name is often shortened to parma or parmi, it may also contain a variety of toppings, including sliced ham or bacon. In Argentina and in other neighboring South American countries, veal or chicken parmigiana is topped with ham and served with french fries. It is known as milanesa a la napolitana. If the dish is topped with a fried egg, it is known as Milanesa a caballo, but omits the tomato sauce. In England, the parmo uses either pork or chicken topped with b√©chamel sauce instead of tomato sauce.

Origin of name The name of this district is derived from the Kurung and the Kumey, the two principal rivers which flow through it. According to myth the Kurung and the Kumey rivers were two sisters; during the age of marriage Kurung eloped without prior permission from her parents and Kumey got married according to her parents' wishes. Therefore, the Kurung flows with a violent roar and ashy color because her parents shouted and threw ashes after her, while the Kumey flows silently and clearly. History The territory occupied by the present district became part of the North East Frontier Tracts in 1914. In 1954, it became part of Subansiri Frontier Division, which was later renamed as Lower Subansiri district. On 1 April 2001, this district was created by bifurcating Lower Subansiri district. Divisions The following are the sub-divisions and circles of Kurung Kumey district: * Nyapin Sub-Division: Circles of Nyapin, Phassang * Koloriang Sub- Division: Circles of Parsi-Parlo, Koloriang, Sangram * Damin Sub-Division: Circles of Sarli, Damin There are two Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies in this district: Nyapin, and Koloriang.

He was a founding partner of Goldstein and Howe (now Goldstein & Russell),Goldstein & Russell website a Washington, D.C., firm specializing in Supreme Court litigation, and was, until the end of 2010, a partner at Akin Gump, where he was co-head of the litigation and Supreme Court practices. In 2003, he co-founded SCOTUSblog, the most widely read blog covering the Supreme Court, and remains the publisher and occasional contributor, providing analyses and summaries of Supreme Court decisions and cert petitions. He previously taught Supreme Court Litigation at Harvard Law School, and Stanford Law School from 2004-2012. Education He graduated from the University of North Carolina was a Bachelor of Arts in 1992 and from the American University Washington College of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1995.THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN Supreme Court practice Over the past fifteen years, Goldstein has served as one of the lawyers for one of the parties in just under 10% of the cases argued before the Supreme Court. Goldstein has argued 30 cases himself. Notably, Goldstein served as second chair for Laurence Tribe and David Boies on behalf of Vice President Al Gore in Bush v. Gore. He also served as second chair for Laurence Tribe on New York Times Co. v. Tasini (decided in 2001). \\"The Hustler,\\" an April 2006 article by Noam Scheiber in The New Republic,Noam Scheiber, The Hustler: Meet Tommy Goldstein The New Republic, 2006-04-10. asserted that Goldstein has had an out-sized impact on the Supreme Court, going so far as to suggest the Court was the \\"Goldstein Court,\\" a phraseology usually reserved for the Chief Justice of the United States during a particular period (e.g. \\"Roberts Court\\", \\"Rehnquist Court\\", \\"Taft Court\\"), but the article offered no empirical data to support that claim. The article focuses on the practice pioneered by Goldstein of identifying and pursuing cases that are likely to be reviewed by the Supreme Court. At the time, the practice was extremely controversial and analogized to ambulance chasing by established members of the bar, including by now-Chief Justice John Roberts, who quipped about contacting the lawyers in cases that if you needed a heart-surgeon, you would not pick the one who called you out of the blue. The practice has since become commonplace among almost all law firm Supreme Court practices and the several Supreme Court litigation clinics in law schools. Blog Goldstein at the Peabody Awards ceremony in 2013 Goldstein founded SCOTUSblog, a prominent blog covering the Supreme Court. In 2013, SCOTUSblog received the Peabody Award for excellence in electronic media. It is the first blog ever to receive the Peabody. It also won the 2013 Society of Professional Journalists (Sigma Delta Chi) prize for deadline reporting for its coverage of the Supreme Court‚Äôs healthcare ruling. It serves as a constantly updated site for information and news about the Supreme Court -- the submissions of new petitions, decisions concerning certiorari, decisions concerning stays of lower court decisions -- particularly executions, oral arguments, and final decisions in all cases. In 2010, SCOTUSblog became the only weblog to receive the American Bar Association‚Äôs Silver Gavel Award for fostering public understanding of the law. While generally regarded as objective, the blog (and Goldstein) on occasion is the subject of criticism from commentators on both the left (such as Glenn Greenwald) and the right (such as Ed Whelan).

However, like Dead or Alive 3, the game features a relatively low number of costumes and several characters now had to be unlocked by the player including Helena. Characters Ryu Hayabusa from Ninja Gaiden fighting against Halo's SPARTAN-458 Returning characters in the game are Ayane, Bass Armstrong, Bayman, Brad Wong, Christie, Hayate, Hitomi, Jann Lee, Kasumi, Leifang, Ryu Hayabusa, Tina Armstrong, and Zack. DOA4 features three new playable characters: Kokoro, a young geisha in training; Eliot, a 16-year-old boy from England and prot√©g√© to Gen Fu; and La Mariposa, a female Lucha Libre wrestler. In addition, DOA4 features a playable unlockable character from the Halo series, a female Spartan supersoldier going by the name \\"Spartan-458\\" (with a Halo-themed stage Nassau Station in the game); it would later be revealed that her real name would be \\"Nicole\\". =New= *Alpha-152 (unplayable), the final stage of the human weapon series Project Alpha, created from Kasumi's DNA by the evil scientist, Victor Donovan. *Eliot, a British xing yi quan practitioner and the only apprentice of the legendary \\"Immovable Fist\\", Gen Fu. Having doubts about himself and questioning why Gen Fu chose him as his successor, Eliot enters the tournament to find out if he has the right to carry on Gen Fu's legacy. *Kokoro, a Japanese young girl currently training to become a geisha. Though she enjoys her lessons, Kokoro's heart and soul truly belong to her bajiquan, and despite her mother's worries, she enters to the tournament to test herself. *La Mariposa, a luchadora who hides her past and true identity underneath her flamboyant costume. La Maripsoa rose like a comet to the peak of stardom only a short while after her debut, and has never lost a match. =Returning= *Ayane *Bass Armstrong *Bayman *Brad Wong *Christie *Hayate *Hitomi *Jann Lee *Kasumi *Leifang *Ryu Hayabusa *Tina Armstrong *Zack =Unlockable= *Ein *Gen Fu *Helena Douglas *Leon *Spartan-458 *Tengu Helena Douglas is unlockable in all modes. Gen Fu, Leon, Ein, Spartan-458 and Tengu are unlockable characters that cannot be used in the story mode. Alpha-152 is an unplayable boss character that cannot be used in any mode. Plot Dead or Alive 4 focuses on the story of Helena Douglas taking over the mantle of the Dead or Alive Tournament Executive Committee as its second chairman, determined to fight against the corruption in the organization. After losing both her father and her beloved mother to the darkness of conspiracy, Helena chose to place herself in the middle of the maelstrom in order to put an end to the chain of tragedy once and for all. The man who holds the true power at DOATEC, Victor Donovan, locked himself in the Bio Lab Core again to continue coveting his dream of creating the perfect human weapon. His new project, code named \\"Alpha-152\\", is the result of the ultimate evolution of hyper-cloning technology, birthed from a DNA sample of Kasumi. The main storyline continues with the war between the DOATEC and the Mugen Tenshin Ninja Clan. After Ayane successfully defeats DOATEC's last creation, Omega, Hayate returned to the Mugen Tenshin clan, taking over the leadership. Now leader, his heart burns with the desire of revenge as he goes on a quest to put an end to DOATEC. During the fourth tournament, Hayate brought together the most powerful group of Ninjas known to man. He is accompanied by Ayane, Ryu Hayabusa, and other members of the Mugen Tenshin clan; Kasumi, though reluctant, is dragged into the events herself as she follows her brother. The ninjas attack DOATEC's primary headquarters, the gigantic Tri-tower buildings. Other competitors such as Brad Wong, Eliot, Jann Lee, Kokoro, La Mariposa, Leifang, and Zack were among chaos as the conflict went on. Bayman vowed to finish off Donovan, Hayate also states his reasons for wanting revenge on the mad scientist as well. Bayman tells Hayate not to interfere in his revenge but Hayate states that he cannot let him fool things up. Kasumi confronts Helena, telling her to stop the fight between DOATEC and the Mugen Tenshin. Helena refuses, stating that Hayate and others will stop at nothing until DOATEC is destroyed, and she will do anything to stop Donovan and Alpha-152 from causing havoc in the world. Helena attempts to shoot Kasumi but she is saved by Hayabusa. Helena is later confronted by Christie who revels that she was her mother's killer. Filled was sadness and now boiling with anger, Helena fights Christie. The ninja assault left the Tri-towers in an inferno, and the buildings' auto- destruct sequence activated by Helena lead to the buildings' ultimate destruction. Helena tries to commit suicide by willingly letting herself be consumed by the flames of the burning buildings. Suddenly, Zack came flying in with a chopper, saving her before the Tri-tower buildings fell to dust. Development and release On May 12, 2005, the first screens from the game were leaked on the Internet via the elotrolado.net message boards. The first official screenshots, in-game demos and cinematics were presented by Microsoft at press conferences, with the game originally slated to be a launch title for the Xbox 360. In an interview with Famitsu Xbox, Tomonobu Itagaki remarked that he spent 99% of his time developing the game, while only sleeping 40 minutes in four days. Technical assistance for Dead or Alive 4 was given by Blindlight. The game was delayed many times before eventually being released on December 29, 2005, more than a month after the Xbox 360 debuted, having been initially held back by retailers. Famitsu Xbox editor-in-chief Munetatsu Matsui pointed to Dead or Alive 4's absence as a launch title as the main factor behind the slow sales of the Xbox 360 in Japan. This was the first main series game to have an M rating by the ESRB, due to a few female characters wearing a few revealing outfits and some cutscenes. Since Dead or Alive 4 release, a demo version of the game has been available for free download via Xbox Live. While the demo showcases the final version of the game, it is a very limited version and only a handful of the features are accessible, while the rest are locked down. Only the Time Attack and Verses modes are playable, there are just five stages available, and only Kasumi, Hayabusa, Brad, Tina, Eliot, and La Mariposa are playable. Some of the settings are also locked-out. Two songs by the American rock band Aerosmith also appear in Dead or Alive 4. \\"Eat the Rich\\" was used as the opening theme, and \\"Amazing\\" was played during Helena's ending movie and over the credits. Soundtrack CD Dead or Alive 4 Original Sound Trax (KWCD-1009) was released in Japan by Wake Up in 2006. Three guide books were published in Japan in 2005-2006: Dead or Alive 4 Official Guide Basic File (by Famitsu Xbox / Enterbrain), Dead or Alive 4 Best Shot (by SoftBank), and Dead or Alive 4 Official Guide Master File (by Enterbrain). The Platinum Collection edition of the game was released in Japan on November 1, 2007. Reception Dead or Alive 4 received very positive reviews. Review aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic gave the game a score of 85.49% and 85/100, respectively. Douglass C. Perry of IGN called the game \\"a move in the right direction for the series\\" and praised the fighting system as \\"deeper and more sophisticated\\". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot wrote: \\"It's simple: If you like fighting games, DOA4 is for you. Between its great selection of powerful fighters, its terrific action, and its addictive online mode, there's an awful lot to sink your teeth into, learn, and master in this latest and greatest installment in the series.\\" The game was included in the Evolution Championship Series, Championship Gaming Series and World Cyber Games. In 2008, GamePro staff ranked it as the 11th best fighting game, stating: \\"The first new-generation fighter to be released, Dead or Alive 4 still makes a strong case as the best one. [...] This is a fighting game that can stand in the ring with any major series.\\" In 2009, Virgin Media ranked it as the seventh top 20 beat 'em-up of all time. In 2011, Peter Rubin of Complex ranked it as the 28th best fighting game of all time.

Background Michael Thornton Burns was born in Mineola, New York on Long Island, a village in Nassau County to director and producer Frank Xavier Burns (best-known for the early television series, Martin Kane, Private Eye) and Mary Lou DeWeese. He has an older sister, Pamela. In 1949, the family moved to Yonkers, New York. In 1956, the family relocated to Beverly Hills, California, where he attended Beverly Hills High School. He attended for a year at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia before he transferred to UCLA, which he attended mostly after hours while still working as an actor during many days and residing in Redondo Beach. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history. He then obtained his Master of Arts in European history at the same institution. In 1977, he entered Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, from which he received his Ph.D. in Modern European history. Career =Actor= Burns was discovered by Lee Wallace, the head of casting for 20th Century Fox, who arranged Burns' debut on the 1960 episode, \\"A Taste of Lobster\\" of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis; Burns played a shrewd 13-year-old businessman, Chrissie Tyler, who owned a babysitting agency. He co-starred in a 19-episode NBC comedy/drama It's a Man's World (1962‚Äì63 season) as 14-year-old Howie Macauley. Beginning in the fall of 1960 Burns would make five guest appearances on Wagon Train during its third and fourth seasons. His sixth guest appearance on the final 6th season episode in 1963 would introduce his character Barnaby West which he would continue to play as a regular until the series end in 1965. Burns appeared with James Stewart in Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation, a 1962 film. In 1965, Burns auditioned for The Monkees and was one of the 14 finalists who completed screen tests. In 1966, he joined Audie Murphy in the western film, 40 Guns to Apache Pass. He appeared as a guest star in over thirty-five series during the 1960s and 1970s, mostly Westerns, including Gunsmoke The Virginian, The Road West, The Legend of Jesse James and The Big Valley. In his twenties, he appeared in several films, including Journey to Shiloh (1968), The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell (1968), That Cold Day in the Park (1969), Thumb Tripping (1972) and Santee (1973). He appeared as \\"Blue Boy\\" in \\"The LSD Story\\", the pilot episode of the relaunched Jack Webb police series Dragnet 1967. =Historian= In 1980, Burns became a professor of history at Mount Holyoke. In 1991, he authored, Dreyfus A Family Affair, 1789‚Äì1945, a study of the Dreyfus affair in France during the 1890s. A reviewer of Burns' book writing in The New York Times called the work \\"a solidly written book about the man and his family, a book that emphasizes the elemental human drama of the captain's story.\\" Upon his retirement in 2002, Burns was honored by Mount Holyoke with the designation professor emeritus. Later life While on the faculty at Mount Holyoke College, Burns wed the college's then-president, Elizabeth Topham Kennan in June 1986. She has a son, Frank Alexander Kennan, from her previous marriage. Since 2002, the couple have resided in Danville, Boyle County, Kentucky, where they have restored the Cambus-Kenneth Estate, a crop, cattle, and thoroughbred horse farm listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He is a member of the Thoroughbred Club of America, Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders, and the Kentucky Cattlemen's Association. A Democrat, Burns was a donor to then U.S. Senator John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election and to Daniel Mongiardo, the party nominee for the U.S. Senate from Kentucky that same year. Kerry and Mongiardo lost to incumbent Republicans George W. Bush and Jim Bunning, respectively.

Often, projections which deviate more from a normal distribution are considered to be more interesting. As each projection is found, the data are reduced by removing the component along that projection, and the process is repeated to find new projections; this is the \\"pursuit\\" aspect that motivated the technique known as matching pursuit. The idea of projection pursuit is to locate the projection or projections from high-dimensional space to low- dimensional space that reveal the most details about the structure of the data set. Once an interesting set of projections has been found, existing structures (clusters, surfaces, etc.) can be extracted and analyzed separately. Projection pursuit has been widely used for blind source separation, so it is very important in independent component analysis. Projection pursuit seeks one projection at a time such that the extracted signal is as non-Gaussian as possible.James V. Stone(2004); \\"Independent Component Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction\\", The MIT Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England;  History  Projection pursuit technique were originally proposed and experimented by Kruskal.Kruskal, JB. 1969; \\"Toward a practical method which helps uncover the structure of a set of observations by finding the line transformation which optimizes a new ‚Äúindex of condensation‚Äù\\", Pages 427‚Äì440 of: Milton, RC, & Nelder, JA (eds), Statistical computation; New York, Academic Press Related ideas occur in Switzer (1970) \\"Numerical classification\\" pp31-43 in \\"Computer Applications in the Earth Sciences: Geostatistics, and Switzer and Wright (1971) \\"Numerical classification of eocene nummulitids,\\" Mathematical Geology pp 297‚Äì311. The first successful implementation is due to Jerome H. Friedman and John Tukey (1974), who named projection pursuit. The original purpose of projection pursuit was to machine-pick \\"interesting\\" low-dimensional projections of a high-dimensional point cloud by numerically maximizing a certain objective function or projection index . Several years later, Friedman and Stuetzle extended the idea behind projection pursuit and added projection pursuit regression (PPR), projection pursuit classification (PPC), and projection pursuit density estimation (PPDE).  Feature  The most exciting feature of projection pursuit is that it is one of the very few multivariate methods able to bypass the \\"curse of dimensionality\\" caused by the fact that high- dimensional space is mostly empty. In addition, projection pursuit are able to ignore irrelevant (i.e. noisy and information-poor) variables. This is a distinct advantage over methods based on interpoint distances like minimal spanning trees, multidimensional scaling and most clustering techniques. Many of the methods of classical multivariate analysis turn out to be special cases of projection pursuit. Examples are principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, and the quartimax and oblimax methods in factor analysis. One serious drawback of projection pursuit methods is their high demand on computer time.

The organic material may be disseminated throughout the rock giving it a uniform dark color, and/or it may be present as discrete occurrences of tar, bitumen, asphalt, petroleum, coal or carbonaceous material. Organic-rich sedimentary rocks may act as source rocks which generate hydrocarbons that accumulate in other sedimentary \\"reservoir\\" rocks (see oil sands and petroleum geology). Potential source rocks are any type of sedimentary rock that the ability to dispel available carbon from within it (limestone is a classic example of a source rock). Good reservoir rocks are any sedimentary rock that has high pore-space availability. This allows the hydrocarbons to accumulate within the rock and be stored for long periods of time (a sandstone commonly makes a good source rock). Highly permeable reservoir rocks are also of interest to industry professionals, as they allow for the easy extraction of the hydrocarbons within. The hydrocarbon reservoir system is not complete however without a \\"cap rock\\". Cap rocks are rock units which have very low porosity and permeability, which trap the hydrocarbons within the units below as they try to migrate upwards. Sandstone with fossil shells.jpgSandstone with fossil shells  Fossil organic carbon  Organic carbon is derived from ancient biological deposition of matter (kerogen is the name given to this by geologists), and this organic matter is buried with mineral and rock fragments into sedimentary rocks.Copard, Y., Amiotte-Suchet, P., Di-Giovanni, C.., (2007) Storage and release of fossil organic carbon related to weathering of sedimentary rocks. Earth and Planetary Science. Vol. 258. pp. 345‚Äì357. The temperature and pressure of the burial conditions will affect the material's diagenetic processes, and determine whether or not the material will be transformed into petroleum. Fossiliferous organic carbon can also be reworked through tectonic processes and returned to the continental surface in the form of an outcrop. Erosion and chemical weathering can cause the organic carbon materials to be transported throughout the modern environment, in rivers, soils, and eventually the oceans. This process occurs over a very large time scale, and acts as one of the major mechanisms for fossiliferous organic carbon to be released back into the environment. Grube Messel Fossil 2005-09-24.jpgOrganic remains preserved in sedimentary rock  Organic sediment production  For decades, it was thought that the majority of the organic-rich sedimentary beds deposited on the ocean floor was a byproduct of three environmental variables: the input of organic material, the rate of sedimentation, and the amount of deep-water oxygenation. These variables are linked on spatial and temporal scales by climate, ocean currents, and sea-level at the time of deposition.Arthur, M.A., Dean, W.E., Stow, D.A.V., 1984, Models for the deposition of Mesozoic-Cenozoic fine- grained organic-carbon-rich sediment in the deep sea, The Geological Society, 15, pp. 527‚Äì560 Any changes in the variables or the parameters that link them will result in different sedimentary deposits, as seen on the surface today. Knowledge of this information is valued among commercial companies, as its application can deduce which sedimentary deposits could be economically productive to exploit. By using the inverse of the previous methodology, these deposits can be used as proxies to infer information such as paleoclimate, previous ocean circulation cycles, past sea-levels, as well as the proportion of variables with relation to one another that caused the production of the deposit. This information can be very valuable to geoscientists, as it can help them reconstruct past processes that ultimately shaped the Earth to form its present state. However, based upon more recent research, these outcomes are no longer completely viable. For example: In case studies of the Black Sea, a modern anoxic environment, it has been shown that anoxia within the lower-levels of the water column alone do not produce significant amount of organic-rich sediments, even though sufficient organic material was supplied to the region in the Holocene. Therefore, the new theory is that \\"primary producers\\" higher in the water column are responsible for the majority of the deposition of carbon-rich sediment in continental margin environments. Based upon a study conducted involving ocean-circulation models in the Cretaceous, it was found that although conditions were relatively similar to those today, the oceans had much harsher currents that influenced the water column.Pederson T.F., Calvert, S.E., 1990, Anoxia vs. Productivity: What Controls the Formation of Organic-Carbon-Rich Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks?, The American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 74(4), pp. 454‚Äì466 The new thought is that these ocean currents were slowed by blooms of microscopic marine primary producers, which allowed for the settlement of organic-rich sediments at the seafloor, producing many of the economically productive black shale beds that are present today. To this day it remains an intensely researched subject by scholars and commercial companies alike. Cwall99 lg.jpgAn example of an algal bloom just south of Cornwall, England.  Role of bacteria in organic-rich sedimentary rocks  Bacteria are thought to be an important contributor to the creation of petroleum source rock. However, studies have shown that abundances of bacterial biomarkers do not always reflect relative contributions to sedimentary organic carbon.Hartgers, W.A., Damste, J. S. S., Requejo, A.G., Allan, J., Hayes, J.M., de Leeuw, J.W. (1994). Evidence for only minor contributions from bacteria to sedimentary organic carbon. Nature. Vol. 369. p. 224. Bacteria in sedimentary rocks are now thought to only have minor contributions to the production of fossil fuels such as oil. As bacterial reworking of sedimentary debris is extremely important, its significance cannot be ignored. Certain bacteria can assist in the breaking down of organic material early in the sedimentary processes, although bacterial biomass itself may represent only a minor component of the total organic carbon in carbonaceous rocks. Many of the ideas of minimal bacterial contribution can be attributed to isotopic studies of the carbon in some sedimentary rocks. Studies of many and varied sedimentary sites are required to come to such conclusions; there are myriad bacterial species, and each organic source rock may have differing interactions with these bacteria. This is why not all bacterial influenced addition of carbon to sedimentary rocks can be excluded: each situation is unique, with varying bacteria, and varying settings. The combination of microscopic and molecular studies should be addressed when interpreting abundances of bacterial biomarkers present in a petroleum source and its influence on the total organic carbon.

His music includes elements of folk music, rhythm and blues, hip hop, and symphonic music. History  Urbaniak started his music education during high school in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, and continued from 1961 in Warsaw in the violin class of Tadeusz Wro≈Ñski. Learning to play on the saxophone alone, he first played in a Dixieland band, and later with Zbigniew Namys≈Çowski and the Jazz Rockers, with whom he performed during the Jazz Jamboree festival in 1961. After this, he was invited to play with Andrzej Trzaskowski, and toured the United States in 1962 with the Andrzej Trzaskowski band, the Wreckers, playing at festivals and clubs in Newport, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, and New York City. After returning to Poland, he worked with Krzysztof Komeda's quintet (1962‚Äì1964). Together, they left for Scandinavia, where, after finishing a couple of contracts, Urbaniak remained until 1969. There he created a band with Urszula Dudziak and Wojciech Karolak, which gained considerable success and was later to be the starting point for the Micha≈Ç Urbaniak Fusion. After Urbaniak returned to Poland and the violin (which he abandoned for the saxophone during the time in Scandinavia), he created the Micha≈Ç Urbaniak Group, to which he invited, among others, Urszula Dudziak (vocals), Adam Makowicz (piano), Pawel Jarzebski ‚Äì bass and Czeslaw Bartkowski ‚Äì drums They recorded their first international albums, Parathyphus B, Instinct and played in many festivals, including Jazz Jamboree in 1969‚Äì1972. During the Montreux '71 festival, Urbaniak was awarded \\"Grand Prix\\" for the best soloist and received a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music in Boston. After many triumphant concerts in Europe and the United States, in May 1973 he played for the last time before a Polish audience and emigrated with Urszula Dudziak on September 11, 1973, to the United States, where he now lives as a U.S. citizen. Despite getting an award from Berklee, he did not study there. Recommended by John H. Hammond, Urbaniak signed a contract with Columbia Records, who published the West German album Super Constellation under the name Fusion. For the tour, he invited Polish musicians, including Czes≈Çaw Bartkowski, Pawe≈Ç Jarzƒôbski, and Wojciech Karolak. In 1974, Urbaniak formed the band Fusion and introduced melodic and rhythmic elements of Polish folk music into his funky New York-based music. With this band Urbaniak recorded another album for Columbia in New York: Atma. Urbaniak followed his musical journey with innovative projects such as Urbanator (the first band to fuse rap & hip-hop in jazz), , Urbanizer (a project with his band and four- piece R&B; vocal group, 1978) and UrbSymphony. On January 27, 1995, UrbSymphony performed and recorded a concert with a rapper and a 60-piece symphony orchestra. Since 1970 Urbaniak has been playing his custom-made, five-string violin furnished especially for him, a violin synthesizer called \\"talking\\" violin; soprano, alto and tenor saxophones; and lyricon, electric saxophone-like horn. His fusion with a hint of folklore was becoming popular among American jazz musicians. He started to play in well known clubs such as the Village Vanguard and Village Gate, in famous concert halls such as Carnegie Hall, Beacon Theatre, and Avery Fisher Hall. Urbaniak has played with Billy Cobham, Buster Williams, Chick Corea, Elvin Jones, Freddie Hubbard, George Benson, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Joe Zawinul, Kenny Barron, Larry Coryell, Lenny White, Marcus Miller, Quincy Jones, Ron Carter, Roy Haynes, Vladyslav Sendecki, Wayne Shorter, and Weather Report. In 1985, he was invited to play during the recording of Tutu with Miles Davis. In 2012, he acted in the Polish film My Father's Bike.

He was the second son of Rukn al-Dawla. Early life Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Hasan was born in 952; he was the son of Rukn al-Dawla and a daughter of the Dailamite Firuzanid nobleman Al-Hasan ibn al-Fairuzan, who was the cousin of Makan ibn Kaki. Abu'l-Hasan received the title of \\"Fakhr al- Dawla\\" in 975. Rise to power and deposition In January of 976 Rukn al- Dawla met with his eldest son, 'Adud al-Dawla, who ruled in Fars. 'Adud al- Dawla consented to Rukn al-Dawla's request that Fakhr al-Dawla be made the ruler of Ray upon his death, while Hamadan would go to a third son, Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, in exchange for a promise that both of them would recognize him as senior amir. Only eight months later, Rukn al-Dawla died and Fakhr al-Dawla succeeded him in Ray, and shortly had his cousin Ali ibn Kama executed. Fakhr al-Dawla's reign was shortened by his attempts to repudiate 'Adud al-Dawla's authority over him. He allied with his cousin 'Izz al-Dawla, who ruled in Baghdad and was an enemy of 'Adud al-Dawla. When the latter was defeated by 'Adud al-Dawla in 978, Fakhr al-Dawla struck up an alliance with the Ziyarid prince Qabus and asked for support from the Samanids. Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, an ally of 'Adud al-Dawla, was entrusted by the senior amir to eradicate Fakhr al-Dawla's power. He marched into Fakhr al-Dawla's territory, forcing the latter to flee to the Ziyarids. Mu'ayyad al-Dawla continued his campaign, however, causing both Fakhr al-Dawla and Qabus to seek refuge in Samanid Khurasan. Mu'ayyad al-Dawla then ruled Ray as 'Adud al-Dawla's subordinate. Return and height of power The deaths of 'Adud al-Dawla in 983 and Mu'ayyad al-Dawla in 984 gave Fakhr al-Dawla the chance to recover his inheritance. Mu'ayyad al-Dawla's vizier, Sahib ibn 'Abbad, held a gathering of the army in Gurgan and convinced it to accept Fakhr al-Dawla as his late master's successor. Fakhr al-Dawla, who was still in Khurasan, traveled to Gurgan, where he was proclaimed amir. This second ascension resulted in him actually possessing more territory than he had owned before his expulsion in 980. In addition to Ray, he now controlled Mu'ayyad al-Dawla's holdings of Hamadan, as well as the formerly Ziyarid lands of Gurgan and Tabaristan. Taking the title of Sh√¢hansh√¢h, he made Sahib ibn 'Abbad his vizier, and took his advice not to restore Qabus to his former territory. Fakhr al-Dawla managed to gain recognition as senior amir by Taj al-Dawla and Diya' al-Dawla, who had in the years following 'Adud al-Dawla's death become the rulers of Khuzestan and Basra respectively. This diplomatic success was of little consequence, however, as the two princes were relatively minor and were forced to seek refuge in Ray when Sharaf al-Dawla, who ruled in Fars, expelled them from their provinces. At the same time, Fakhr al-Dawla attempted to gain a footing in Samanid Khurasan, by supporting the Turkish rebel Tash in his attempts to recover the governorship of that province. This support did not help him, however, as he was defeated and forced to flee to Gurgan at the end of 987. Fakhr al-Dawla made him the governor of Gurgan, where Tash died in 988. Sharaf al-Dawla, who had united Fars and Iraq in 987, had died in 988 and left his brother Baha' al-Dawla his empire. Another brother, Samsam al-Dawla, seized Fars, Kerman and Khuzestan, depriving Baha' al-Dawla of those areas. Fakhr al-Dawla attempted to take advantage of their rivalry by invading Khuzestan, with the goal of cutting off Iraq from Fars. This action failed due to the rough terrain and climate, and succeeded only in uniting the two brothers against him. This threat did not last, however, as Samsam al-Dawla and Sharaf al-Dawla eventually resumed hostilities against each other. Only a few years later, Samsam al-Dawla recognized Fakhr al-Dawla as senior amir in an effort to secure his increasingly weak position. This marked the height of Fakhr al-Dawla's power; in addition to his own territories, he now had authority over Samsam al-Dawla, who ruled Fars, Kerman, Khuzestan, and Oman. Campaign against Khurasan and death Now the ruler of all of Buyid Iran, Fakhr al-Dawla, with the support of his vizier Sahib ibn 'Abbad, decided to undertake a campaign to seize Khurasan from the Samanids. In 994 or 995 he invaded the province, but was to ultimately prove unsuccessful. Mahmud, the son of the Ghaznavid ruler Seb√ºk Tigin, had been appointed by the Samanids as governor of Khurasan, causing the Ghaznavids to support the defense against the invasion. Despite his large amount of forces, Fakhr al-Dawla was forced to retreat. In 995 Sahib ibn 'Abbad died. The vizier had played an important part in maintaining Fakhr al-Dawla's grip on Buyid Iran, and his loss was unfortunate. In 997 Fakhr al-Dawla himself died. His eldest son, Majd al- Dawla, succeeded him in Ray, while his younger son, Shams al-Dawla, succeeded him in Hamadan. Due to their youth, Fakhr al-Dawla's wife, Sayyida Shirin assumed the regency. Fakhr al-Dawla's death marked the beginning of the decline of the Buyids in northern Iran; shortly afterwards Qabus managed to restore Ziyarid rule to Gurgan and Tabaristan.

Description It is a climbing herbaceous plant growing to 2‚Äì4 m tall, with stems that twine anticlockwise. The leaves are spirally arranged, heart-shaped, up to 10 cm long and 8 cm broad, with a petiole up to 5 cm long. It is dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The flowers are individually inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 3‚Äì6 mm diameter, with six petals; the male flowers produced in slender 5‚Äì10 cm racemes, the female flowers in shorter clusters. The fruit is a bright red berry, 1 cm diameter. Its fairly large tuber is, like the rest of the plant, poisonous.

Habitat Dioscorea communis is a typical plant of the forest understory, from the sea to the mountains, usually in dense woods, but it can also be found in meadows and hedges.  Uses  All components of the black bryony plant, including the tubers, are poisonous due to saponin content, so it is not typically used internally; however, it has been used as a poultice for bruises and inflamed joints. It has been suggested that black bryony be used topically with caution, due to a tendency for the plant to cause painful blisters. Studies have isolated calcium oxalate deposits and histamines in the berry juice and rhizomes, which may contribute to skin irritation and contact dermatitis associated with black bryony. Black Bryony is highly poisonous and should not be ingested at all at least when raw. When cooked, young shoots are commonly eaten in southern France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Croatia.  Chemistry  The rhizome contains phenanthrenes (7-hydroxy-2,3,4,8-tetramethoxyphenanthrene, 2,3,4-trimethoxy-7,8-methylenedioxyphenanthrene, 3-hydroxy-2,4,-dimethoxy-7,8-methylenedioxyphenanthrene, 2-hydroxy-3,5,7-trimethoxyphenanthrene and 2-hydroxy-3,5,7-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene).

Across the chapel is a second Caravaggio depicting the Crucifixion of Saint Peter. On the altar between the two is the Assumption of the Virgin Mary by Annibale Carracci.  History  A notary's copy of the contract between Caravaggio and Cerasi.The two lateral paintings of the Cerasi Chapel were commissioned in September 1600 by Monsignor Tiberio Cerasi, Treasurer-General to Pope Clement VIII who purchased the chapel from the Augustinian friars on 8 July 1600 and entrusted Carlo Maderno to rebuild the small edifice in Baroque style. The contract for the altarpiece with Carracci has not been preserved but it is generally assumed that the document had been signed somewhat earlier, and Caravaggio had to take into consideration the other artist's work and the overall iconographic programme of the chapel.Denis Mahon: Egregius in Urbe Pictor: Caravaggio revised, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 93, No. 580 (Jul., 1951), p. 226 Although much has been said about the supposed rivalry between the painters, there is no historical evidence about any serious tensions. Both were successful and sought-after artists in Rome. Caravaggio gained the Cerasi commission right after his celebrated works in the Contarelli Chapel had been finished, and Carracci was busy creating his great fresco cycle in the Palazzo Farnese. In these circumstances there was little reason for them to regard each other as business rivals, states Denis Mahon.Denis Mahon op. cit. p. 230 The contract signed on 24 September 1600 stipulates that \\"the distinguished painter, Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio\\" will paint two large cypress panels, ten palms high and eight palms wide, representing the conversion of Saint Paul and the martyrdom of Saint Peter within eight months for the price of 400 scudi. The contract gave a free hand to the painter to choose the figures, persons and ornaments depicted in the way as he saw fit, \\"to the satisfaction however of his Lordship\\", and he was also obliged to submit preparatory studies before the execution of the paintings. Caravaggio received 50 scudi as advance payment from the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani with the rest earmarked to be paid on completion. The dimensions specified for the panels are virtually the same as the size of the existing canvasses.Walter F. Friedlaender: Caravaggio Studies, Schocken Books, 1969, pp. 302-303 When Tiberio Cerasi died on 3 May 1601 Caravaggio was still working on the paintings as attested by an avviso dated 5 May mentioned that the chapel was being decorated by the hand of the \\"famosissimo Pittore\\", Michelangelo da Caravaggio. A second avviso dated 2 June proves that Caravaggio was still at work on the paintings a month later. He completed them sometime before 10 November when he received the final instalment from the heirs of Tiberio Cerasi, the Fathers of the Ospedale della Consolazione.Christopher L. C. E. Witcombe, Two \\"Avvisi\\", Caravaggio, and Giulio Mancini, in: Source: Notes in the History of Art, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Spring 1993), pp. 22, 25. The total compensation for the paintings was reduced to 300 scudi for unknown reasons.Stefania Macioce: Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio: fonti e documenti 1532‚Äì1724, Ugo Bozzi, 2003, doc. 116., p. 106 The paintings were finally installed in the chapel on 1 May 1605 by the woodworker Bartolomeo who received four scudi and fifty baiocchi from the Ospedale for his work.Stefania Macioce, op. cit., p. 161 The Odescalchi Balbi version of the painting The first version Giovanni Baglione in his 1642 biography about Caravaggio reports that the first versions of both paintings were rejected: > \\"The panels at first had been painted in a different style, but because they > did not please the patron, Cardinal Sannesio took them; in their place he > painted the two oil paintings that can be seen there today, since he did not > use any other medium. And - so to speak - Fortune and Fame carried him > along.\\"Giovanni Baglione: The Life of Michelagnolo da Caravaggio, in Giulio > Mancini, Giovanni Baglione, Giovanni Pietro Bellori: Lives of Caravaggio, > Pallas Athene, 2005 This report is the only historical source for the well-known story. Although the biography was written decades after the events, its veracity is generally accepted. Baglione provided no further explanation about the reasons and circumstances of the rejection but modern scholarship has put forward several theories and conjectures. The first versions of the paintings were obviously acquired by Giacomo Sannesio, secretary of the Sacra Consulta and an avid collector of art. The first Conversion of Saint Paul ended up in the Odescalchi Balbi Collection. It is a much brighter and more Mannerist canvas, with an angel-sustained Jesus reaching down towards a blinded Paul. X-ray examination revealed another, almost complete version of the scene under the present painting, in which the saint is shown fallen to the ground, on the right of the canvas, his eyes open, his forehead lined, and his right hand raised.Helen Langdon about Caravaggio, Carracci, Maderno. La cappella Cerasi in Santa Maria del Popolo. Edited by Maria Grazia Bernardini in The Burlington Magazine 144 (1190), January 2002, p. 300 Description The conversion of Paul from persecutor to apostle is a well-known biblical story. According to the New Testament, Saul of Tarsus was a zealous Pharisee, who intensely persecuted the followers of Jesus, even participating in the stoning of Stephen. He was on his way from Jerusalem to Damascus to arrest the Christians of the city. > As he went he drew near Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone > around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, ‚ÄúSaul, > Saul, why do you persecute Me?\\" He said, ‚ÄúWho are You, Lord?‚Äù The Lord said, > ‚ÄúI am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.‚ÄùActs of the Apostles 9:3-5, Modern > English Version Saul is almost embracing his visionThe painting depicts this moment recounted in the Acts of the Apostles, when Saul fell off his horse on the road to Damascus, seeing a blinding light and hearing the voice of Jesus. For Saul this is a moment of intense religious ecstasy: he is lying on the ground, supine, eyes shut, with his legs spread and his arms raised upward as if embracing his vision. The saint is a muscular young man, and his garment looks like a Renaissance version of a Roman soldier's attire: orange and green muscle cuirass, pteruges, tunic and boots. His plumed helmet fell off his head and his sword is lying by his side. The red cape almost looks like a blanket under his body. The horse is passing over him led by an old groom, who points his finger at the ground. He had calmed down the animal, and now prevents it treading upon Saul. The huge steed has a mottled brown and cream fur; it is still foaming at the mouth, and its hoof is hanging in the air. The scene is lit by a strong light but the three figures are engulfed by an almost impenetrable darkness. A few faint rays on the right evoke Jesus' epiphany but these are not the real source of the lighting, and the groom remains seemingly oblivious to the presence of the divine. Because the skewbald horse is unsaddled, it is suggested that the scene takes place in a stable instead of an open landscape.For example by Ann Sutherland Harris: Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture, Laurence King Publishing, London, 2005, p. 43; or Francesca Marini: Caravaggio and Europe, Random House Inc, 2006, p. 112  Style  Iconography Taddeo Zuccari's Conversion of Saint Paul in the Church of San Marcello al Corso Well-established iconographic tradition stipulated how the Conversion of Paul should be depicted in Renaissance and Baroque art. Its characteristic elements were a rearing, panicked horse ‚Äì although there is no mention of a horse in the Bible -, Saul lying on the ground, Jesus appearing in the sky and a retinue of soldiers reacting to the events. This is how Taddeo Zuccari, one of the most renowned painters in Caravaggio's Rome, portrayed the scene on a large altarpiece in the Church of San Marcello al Corso around 1560. The figure of Paul in the Cerasi Conversion was derived from a model by Raphael via Zuccari.Lorenzo Pericolo: Caravaggio and Pictorial Narrative Dislocating the Istoria in Early Modern Painting, Harvey Miller Publishers, 2011, p. 257 Raphael's version was part of his series of tapestries created for the Sistine Chapel in 1515‚Äì16. \\"If we could turn Raphael's Saint Paul in such a way that his head would touch the lower frame and the length of his body would be directed more or less orthogonally inward, we would have a figure similar to that in Caravaggio's painting\\", observed Walter Friedlaender. He also suggested that the inspiration for the horse was Albrecht D√ºrer's most famous print, The Large Horse (1505), whose main subject has the same bulky, powerful hindquarters and the rest of its body is seen from a similar oblique angle.Walter Friedlaender: Caravaggio Studies, Schocken Books, 1969, p. 21 and pp. 7-8 Another possible source for the painting is a four-block woodcut attributed to Ugo da Carpi (c. 1515‚Äì20) whose central detail depicts Saul on the ground and a groom trying to calm his panicked horse and leading the animal away.David Rosand and Michelangelo Muraro: Titian and the Venetian woodcut, Washington, 1976, cat. 13 This is the only known example among the antecedents which represents exactly the same moment as Caravaggio's painting. A more obvious, although less close precursor was the Conversion of Saint Paul by Michelangelo in the Pauline Chapel (1542‚Äì45) where a rearing horse and a soldier holding its bridle are conspicuous elements in the middle of the crowded scene. A painting that Caravaggio must have known was a very unusual Conversion which Moretto da Brescia painted for the Mint of Milan in 1540‚Äì41. This scene consists only two figures: Saul and his horse, and the horse strangely dominates the painting.Friedlaender: Caravaggio Studies, pp. 26-27 Moretto was probably inspired by a similar Conversion attributed to Parmigianino (1527). Although some details and motifs may have been borrowed or inspired by these artworks, it is important to note that the pared-down composition and the intense spiritual drama of the Cerasi Conversion was a novelty without any direct iconographic precedent at the time. It represented a break with the tradition that even Caravaggio's own previous version more or less followed. Tenebrism Tenebrism creates strong contrasts between lighted and dark areas of the paintingMost of Caravaggio's paintings after 1600 depicted religious subjects, and were placed in churches. According to Denis Mahon, the two paintings in the Cerasi Chapel form \\"a closely-knit group of sufficiently clear character\\" with The Inspiration of Saint Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel and The Entombment of Christ in the Pinacoteca Vaticana. He called these four works \\"the middle group\\" and stated that they belong to Caravaggio's mature period. Comparing the two paintings in the Cerasi Chapel, Mahon saw the Conversion of Saint Paul \\"much more animated than its companion\\". This is conveyed solely by the ingenious use of the light because Caravaggio eschewed any but the slightest movements. This way he rendered \\"the scene unclear, mysterious and therefore curiously mouvement√©.\\"Mahon op. cit. p. 230 Caravaggio's style of tenebrism, where forms in paintings emerge from a dark background with usually one source of stark light, created dramatic effects with its strong contrasts. This lighting was evoking spiritual drama in the Conversion of Saint Paul.Catherine R. Puglisi: Caravaggio, Phaidon Press, 2000, p. 221 The brighter areas are juxtaposed with \\"heavy dark patches, especially deep beneath the horse's belly and extending into impenetrable darkness that lies outside and beyond the circular grouping of the three figures\\". The usual landscape background was dismissed entirely and replaced with an intense concentration on the three figures who compose the scene.Sloan, Grietje. ‚ÄúThe Transformation of Religious Conversion from the Renaissance to the Counter-Reformation: Petrarch and Caravaggio.‚Äù Historical Reflections / R√©flexions Historiques, vol. 15, no. 1, 1988, p. 145. The strong light and the enveloping darkness makes this focus even more intense. The unusual placement of the characters also served to convey the intensity of the moment. Although Saul gets the most light, the attention is given to him in a strange way. Lying on the ground, he is much smaller than the horse, which is also at the center of the painting. Paul's body is foreshortened, and is not facing the viewer, and yet his presence is the most powerful because of his body is pushing into the viewer's space. The position of the horse and especially the front leg, which is hanging in the air, creates even more visual tension. The first compositional draft revealed by the X-ray examination was a more traditional composition with a visible source of divine radiance coming from the left.Maria Grazia Bernardini: Caravaggio, Carracci, Maderno. La cappella Cerasi in Santa Maria del Popolo, 2001, Silvana, p. 126  Reception  Giovanni Pietro BelloriCaravaggio was a successful and celebrated artist at the time of the Cerasi commission but the unusual style and composition of the painting gave rise to criticism early on. The first influential art critic who dismissed the painting was Giovanni Pietro Bellori. In 1672 he wrote in The lives of the modern painters, sculptors and architects about the Cerasi Chapel: > \\"Caravaggio executed the two lateral paintings, the Crucifixion of Saint > Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul; whose history is completely bereft > of action.\\"Giovanni Pietro Bellori: Le vite de' pittori, scultori et > architetti moderni, Rome, Mascardi, 1672, p. 207 This is a more scathing criticism than it sounds because Bellori claimed that \\"painting is nothing but the imitation of human action\\"; thus a painting completely without action was a non-painting for him. The deviations from the traditional iconography all made the painting \\"bereft of action\\" in his eyes: the prominence of the horse instead of the biblical hero; the absence of Jesus; and the focusing upon an insignificant moment in the story after the fall of Saul instead of its real climax, the divine epiphany. Undoubtedly, the narrative momentum was disrupted by these decisions but Caravaggio has done this to extend the conventional confines of pictorial narration.Lorenzo Pericolo op. cit. pp. 259-61 Bellori stands at the head of a long line of hostile commentary. The art historian Jacob Burckhardt in his traveller's guide to painting in Italy (1855) instanced the Conversion on how \\"coarse\\" the compositions of Caravaggio were \\"when he did not care for expression\\", criticising that \\"the horse nearly fills the whole of the picture\\".Jacob Burckhardt: The cicerone: or, Art-guide to painting in Italy, London, J. Murray, 1873, p. 230 Caravaggio's reputation reached its lowest point in the second half of the 19th century. The most popular travel guides of the period, published by Karl Baedeker, in their very detailed descriptions of Santa Maria del Popolo simply omit the two canvases of Caravaggio and the Cerasi Chapel. The paintings are not mentioned in the fifteen editions published between 1867 and 1909. The English art critic, Roger Fry in his Transformations (1927) says that the Conversion is a combination of melodrama and photographic realism which is typical of the religious paintings of Caravaggio. \\"The original design of man and horse is not without merit, despite the triviality of observation and insistence on details for their illusive effect, but the whole design comes to pieces when St. Paul is thus wilfully pushed into the scene and the parts have no longer any significance in relation to the whole.\\", he argued.Roger Fry: Transformations, Chatto & Windus, Freeport, 1927. p. 118 Even in 1953 Bernard Berenson, probably the greatest authority on Italian Renaissance painting in the first half of the 20th century, called the painting a charade: > \\"Nothing more incongruous than the importance given to horse over rider, to > dumb beast over saint. Surely more picaresque than holy.\\"Bernard Berenson: > Caravaggio: His Incongruity and His Fame, Chapman & Hall, London, 1953, pp. > 25-27 Roberto LonghiOpinions changed again fundamentally in the middle of the 20th century when Caravaggio was recognized as one of the greatest painters in the history of Western art. Roberto Longhi, who brought his name forward in the 1950s, wrote in 1952 that completely sweeping away the iconographical tradition of the time, Caravaggio offered for public view \\"what is perhaps the most revolutionary painting in the history of religious art. [...] Were it not for the fact that the painting was placed on a side wall, we might wonder how Caravaggio could have had it put on public exhibition without encountering severe criticism, or even an outright rejection.\\"Roberto Longhi: Caravaggio, Edition Leipzig, 1968, translated by Brian D. Phillips (edition in English) Another leading scholar at the time, Walter Friedlaender in his groundbreaking monography, Caravaggio Studies (1955) used the analysis of the Conversion of Saint Paul as an introduction to the art of Caravaggio. He emphasized that both paintings of the Cerasi Chapel \\"were, in spite of their radically new and unaccustomed conceptions, perfectly fit objects for devotional meditation\\", because the scenes \\"are not remote spectacles, far separated from the spectator. They speak directly to him, on his own level. He can understand and share their experiences: the awakening of faith, and the martyrdom of faith.\\"Friedlaender op. cit., p. 33 This appreciation found a literary expression in a poem by Thom Gunn, a young English poet who was highly regarded by British critics in the 1950s. Gunn spent a few months in Rome on a student fellowship in 1953 after graduating at Cambridge, and he was much impressed by the paintings of Caravaggio in the Cerasi Chapel.Jeffrey Meyers: Thom Gunn and Caravaggio's Conversion of St. Paul, Style, 44 (2010), p. 586 The poem was published in the Poetry magazine in 1958 under the title In Santa Maria del Popolo ('The Conversion of St. Paul').Poetry, October 1958, Volume XCIII Number I, p. 1 It gives an entirely secular reading of the painting, devoid of anything sacred, interpreting it as \\"the defeat of a yearning for the Absolute which is inevitably denied to man [...], as a sort of defeated Faust.\\"Stefania Michelucci: The Poetry of Thom Gunn.

(True Sounds of Liberty). An original member of the band, founded in Southern California in 1979, Emory left in 1987 prior to the release of the album Hit and Run. In 1996, he joined the other original members of T.S.O.L. to reform the band, which remains active. Emory worked on a solo project titled Walk That Walk, which was released on April 15, 2010. Emory played with Social Distortion during their 2006 tour to fill in for his friend Mike Ness, who had broken his wrist in a skateboarding accident.  Biography  = Early life = He grew up in Southern California where he met Jack Grisham, Todd Barnes and Mike Roche to form the Punk Band, T.S.O.L. in 1979.

The original line- up of the band was vocalist Jack Grisham, guitarist Ron Emory, bassist Mike Roche, and drummer Todd Barnes. T.S.O.L.'s initial line-up gained a fans from the hardcore punk, art punk, death punk, horror punk, and goth genres. During his time with T.S.O.L., the band was notorious for their controversial, transgressive, and political lyrics. The original T.S.O.L. broke up in 1983, and Emory and Mike Roche enlisted vocalist Joe Wood (Grisham's brother-in-law at the time) and drummer Mitch Dean into the band, playing hair metal, touring and recording under the name T.S.O.L.

Lotus Agenda is a \\"free-form\\" information manager: the information need not be structured at all before it is entered into the database. A phrase such as \\"See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm\\" can be entered as is without any pre-processing. Its distinguishing feature was the ability to allow users to input data before the creation of database tables, giving the program flexibility to accommodate the myriad pieces of information a person may need to keep track of. The program was an attempt to create a \\"spreadsheet\\" for words. The computing industry was at first quite taken by its audacious goal and the power it brought to users as they were given a tool that allowed them to structure \\"real life\\" information in any way they wished. Its flexibility proved to be its weakness. New users confronted with so much flexibility were often overpowered by the steep learning curve required to use the program. Attempts to overcome this through packaging pre-built databases with the program were insufficient to lift sales to adequate levels. In the end only a few hundred thousand copies were sold. The program reached version 2.0b. Instead of porting Agenda to Windows, Lotus stopped development on this program and introduced a new PIM, Lotus Organizer, that uses the paper-based organizer metaphor, in its place. The program The following jargon is used to describe Agenda's concepts: An \\"Item\\" is a piece of free-form text A \\"Category\\" is a way of organizing information and was the original smart folder concept used by Microsoft Outlook 2003 and by the Spotlight utility in Mac OS X v10.4. Items can be automatically or manually assigned (linked) to one or more Categories. Categories can be organized hierarchically and viewed as a tree network. \\"Parent\\" categories could inherit assignments from \\"child\\" categories. Agenda performs automatic categorization after it learns your associations. For example, if you link Project A to Mary, then every time you enter an item about Project A, the item is automatically assigned to Mary. The information is presented in \\"views\\": in effect spreadsheet-like grids with items forming the rows and categories forming the columns. Users can create as many views as they like, selecting columns to include and how to sort the items. For example, you can create a People view that displays items sorted by the people to whom they are assigned and columns such as Project Name, Status and Due Date. \\"Conditions\\" and \\"actions\\" allow users to set up assignment rules. Once an item is entered, the program can interpret the text to assign it to various categories. In every database a \\"When\\" category is included automatically so that if a date is embedded within the text, it is interpreted and an assignment is made. For example, the item \\"See Wendy on Tuesday 3pm\\" is automatically assigned to the following Tuesday at 3pm. If a category \\"Wendy\\" had also been created then an assignment could also have been made as well. You create a Wendy category by adding a Column called People and typing Wendy as a column entry. Then any time you type Wendy in any item, that item is also assigned to the Wendy category without your needing to make the assignment in a people column (and even if the view in which you enter the new item about Wendy does not include a People column). This gives the user a quick ability to find every item that has an association to Wendy. The program can be used for: * Time management * Project management * Research and information sifting * General purpose database * Accounting * Problem solving * Legal practice management * Managing legal litigation cases Technical description Agenda has some novel technical features. Most notably, database views support item addition and modification, which means that Agenda must infer item attributes from the view. For example, if a view contains the category Home, and the user creates an item \\"paint bathroom\\" in this view, then Agenda attaches the Home attribute to the item. In some cases, assignment cannot be exactly determined and Agenda uses a set of heuristics to make reasonable assignment choices. Agenda's designers described these core concepts in a 1990 CACM paper , and patented some of its internal data structures . Current status The program has been released as freeware. It can be downloaded from the links below. Lotus Agenda can still be used on Windows 3.x/9x/ME/2000/XP computers and there are still many active users around the world (see the Pimlist email list on Yahoo groups). It suffers from: * Only handling textual information * A lack of file compatibility with office applications and information from the Internet means that information must be transferred manually between them. * The program cannot print directly to USB printers. Revival attempts * Beeswax is free software \\"inspired by Lotus Agenda\\", allowing similar functionality, and retaining a text-only interface. The last release was in 2008. * Chandler was an ambitious fully-graphic project inspired by Agenda. Although Mitch Kapor was involved in the vision, management and funding, it ultimately foundered.

In 2005, Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc., was formed by The Carlyle Group, following its purchase of the Hawaiian Telecom Inc. assets of Verizon Communications. On July 2, 2018, Cincinnati Bell purchased Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. for $650 Million,https://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/news/2018/07/02/cincinnati-bell- completes-acquisition-of-hawaiian.html Hawaiian Telcom provides a wide range of consumer, business, wholesale communications and technology services. Service offerings include local phone, long distance, internet services (DSL and Fiber Optics), and television service; along with wireless service such as a mobile virtual network operator using leased capacity provided by Sprint and Verizon Wireless's CDMA networks on the consumer side. Hawaii operations of Verizon Wireless were not included in the 2004 sale to The Carlyle Group, and Verizon Wireless continues to operate in Hawaii as before the divestiture. Among the company's business offerings are a full range of Internet Protocol services (IP), including ethernet, high-bandwidth data services, managed services and cloud-based services. History Hawaiian Telcom was founded in 1883 as the Mutual Telephone Company, chartered under the Kingdom of Hawaii. An original owner was Archibald Scott Cleghorn, father of Princess Ka'iulani. It was the second telephone company chartered in Hawaii, after the Hawaiian Bell Telephone Company in 1880. Mutual took over Hawaiian Bell in 1894. With the acquisition of the phone service of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company on the island of Lanai, Mutual owned the phone system of the Hawaiian islands. Mutual changed its name to Hawaiian Telephone Company in 1954. In 1967 Connecticut- based GTE Corp. acquired Hawaiian Telephone and renamed it GTE Hawaiian Tel. After the 2000 merger of GTE with New York-based Bell Atlantic, forming Verizon Communications, GTE Hawaiian Tel became Verizon Hawaii. Original company stock certificate A Hawaiian Telcom facility in Kailua Kona, HI, USA Recent ownership In 2004 Verizon Communications finalized a deal to sell Verizon Hawaii to the Washington, D.C.-based investment firm The Carlyle Group. At the time, Carlyle's purchase of Verizon Hawaii was quite controversial with the public and competitive local exchange carriers, Time Warner Telecom and Pacific LightNet, who had doubts about the Carlyle's lack of experience operating telecommunication businesses, and their intentions as to raising rates, upgrading the network with optical fiber as former-parent Verizon was doing on the mainland, and possible resale of the business in just a few years, all seen as being detrimental to the public interest. Upon disconnecting from Verizon's back-office systems in April 2005, the company experienced difficulties transitioning to its own systems. Issues ranged from extremely long hold times to speak to representatives, to duplicate and delayed bills. In February 2007, the company announced that it had reached a settlement with its original systems consultant, BearingPoint, and had hired a new contractor, Accenture, to complete the transition to the new systems. Hawaiian Telcom announced on February 4, 2008, that it was replacing CEO Michael Ruley with turnaround expert Stephen F. Cooper, chairman of Kroll Zolfo Cooper. Cooper's previous management engagements include Enron and Krispy Kreme. On May 8, 2008, the company named Eric Yeaman as its new CEO, succeeding interim CEO Cooper. Yeaman previously served as Chief Operating Officer of Hawaiian Electric Company, the electric utility serving the island of Oahu. The company also announced that Walter Dods, former president of First Hawaiian Bank and one of several local investors in Hawaiian Telcom, was assuming the role of Chairman of the Board. =Acquisition by Cincinnati Bell= On July 10, 2017, Cincinnati Bell announced it would acquire Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc., parent of local telephone company Hawaiian Telcom for $650 million. The sale received the approval of the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in April 2018 and was completed in July 2018. Following the completion of the sale to Cincinnati Bell, the company announced that John Komeiji had been promoted to the role of president and general manager. Komeiji had previously served as chief administrative officer and general counsel. In December 2019, Hawaiian Telcom parent Cincinnati Bell announced that Brookfield Infrastructure Partners would acquire the company, including Hawaiian Telcom, for $2.6 billion. On January 7, 2020, Su Shin was promoted to the position of president and general manager following Komeiji's resignation to assume the post of general counsel at Kamehameha Schools. Bankruptcy On December 1, 2008, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after missing an interest payment on its debt. With the bankruptcy, The Carlyle Group's ownership had been reduced to a small stake. In November 2009, Cerberus Capital Management announced to the bankruptcy court that it had acquired $7.6 million of Hawaiian Telcom's debt. The company's plan to reduce its debt by more than $800 million was approved by Judge Lloyd King of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on November 13, 2009. The plan required approval by the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission. After leaving bankruptcy, the company's stock became publicly traded on the NYSE in 2010, moving to NASDAQ in 2011. Cable franchise On June 24, 2011, The State of Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs issued a 15-year cable franchise license to Hawaiian Telcom, thus ending Oceanic Time Warner's 35-year monopoly as the state's sole cable TV provider.\\"Hawaiian Telcom gets a license for cable TV\\" from Honolulu Star- Advertiser (June 25, 2011) Hawaiian Telcom launched the service on July 1, 2011, after a year of testing in the Honolulu area.\\"Hawaiian Telcom TV kicks off around Oahu\\" from Honolulu Star-Advertiser (July 2, 2011) Island-wide service began in 2012.

The band consisted of Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley, Lol Creme and ‚Äì briefly ‚Äì Graham Gouldman. In 1972, the band was relaunched as 10cc.  Premise  Stewart had earlier enjoyed success as a member of the 1960s pop band The Mindbenders and had delivered the vocals for that band's best-known track, \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\". The Mindbenders disbanded in November 1968Q Rock Stars Encyclopedia, ed. Dafydd Rees & Luke Crampton, Dorling Kindersley, 1999. and Stewart teamed with Peter Tattersall, a former road manager for Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, and Gouldman, a fellow Mindbender and successful songwriter, to become joint owners of a Stockport recording studio which in 1969 was renamed Strawberry Studios. Stewart and Gouldman enlisted Godley and Creme, longtime friends of Gouldman who had earlier launched an abortive career under entrepreneur Giorgio Gomelsky as duo Frabjoy and Runcible Spoon, and the team gained work writing and performing bubblegum songs under a variety of band names for US producers writer- producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz of Super K Productions, as well as other session work.  History  \\"Neanderthal Man\\" was created by the trio of Stewart, Godley and Creme as they dabbled with newly installed recording equipment at Strawberry Studios, perfecting drum layering on a four-track machine. (At that time, Gouldman was in New York City working out the final six months of his contract with Super K Productions.) The song consisted primarily of a chanted chorus backed by Stewart's and Creme's acoustic guitars and a lumbering drum rhythm provided by Godley. The song was released as a single under the moniker Hotlegs and reached No.2 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1970 and No. 22 in the US, ultimately selling two million copies worldwide. The band recorded a follow-up album, Thinks: School Stinks, for Philips before branding themselves as Doctor Father in August 1970 for a new version of \\"Umbopo\\" on Pye Records. The song was one they had originally recorded for Kasenetz and Katz for release under the name Crazy Elephant. Doctor Father's version failed to attract airplay or sales. In October 1970 the band was invited to tour Britain with The Moody Blues. Gouldman, newly returned to the U.K., joined the band on bass, marking the gigs as the first at which the four future members of 10cc played live on stage. After just four shows, however, the tour was cancelled when John Lodge of the Moody Blues contracted a virus. Gouldman recalled that the band returned to their homes in Manchester expecting something else to turn up. \\"But nothing happened,\\" he said. \\"It was really quite amazing. We'd opened a tour with the Moody Blues ... we were expecting offers of work to arrive, but no one asked us to do anything. The next Hotlegs records flopped and we didn't get a single offer of work. It was extraordinary. We'd had a hit record that had sold two million copies and nobody wanted us.\\" Another single was released by Hotlegs in Britain ‚Äì \\"Lady Sadie\\" (1971, a very naughty lyric with a standard arrangement) ‚Äì and two others overseas (\\"Run Baby Run\\", US and \\"Desperate Dan\\", Germany and Spain), but none charted. In 1976 Stewart, by then achieving success with 10cc, admitted: \\"'Lady Sadie' had no class and no originality. It was a very mediocre pop song.\\" The album also presented a problem, he said: \\"That was so different to 'Neanderthal Man' that it was totally alien to what people were expecting from us. It was a good record, a little ahead of its time. It was similar to the things we are doing now. It was very melodic with chord structures that hadn't been used before ‚Äì and some of the sounds that we used on that album hadn't been heard at the time.\\" The band returned to the studios to work with other performers. Stewart said: \\"We sat down one day and said, 'Hotlegs is defunct ‚Äì let's face it.' And we decided to carry on with our production work.\\" Godley, in a 1976 interview, described the band as \\"doomed\\": After Thinks: School Stinks received worldwide release, it was repackaged (in the UK) by the Philips label in December 1971 with several tracks replacing originals, including \\"Neanderthal Man\\". A compilation album was issued in Britain in 1976 as You Didn't Like It Because You Didn't Think of It putting together previously released material. The lack of further chart activity saw Hotlegs labelled as a one-hit wonder. In 1972, Hotlegs was relaunched as 10cc. Aftermath Thinks: School Stinks was reissued by One Way Records in 1994 on CD. This edition included the line up from the original album release only. You Didn't Like It Because You Didn't Think of It was reissued by 7T's (a division of Cherry Red) on 22 October 2012. The reissue featured a new cover commissioned for the new release and a booklet with information on the making of the album. The track listing includes all of the original tracks as well as the title track and the US stereo mix for \\"Neanderthal Man\\". This was the first CD release for the album which includes all the tracks that Stewart, Godley & Creme recorded as Hotlegs. Name According to Eric Stewart, in the 2009 BBC radio documentary The Record Producers, the band's name came about because \\"there was a lovely girl at the time, a receptionist called Kathy, and she used to wear these hot pants, and we always used to call her 'hot legs', and so we thought we'll call the group Hotlegs\\".

Key themes in her work included Christianity, and social justice. She was also a teacher at the Immaculate Heart College. Corita was born Frances Elizabeth Kent on November 20th in the year of 1918. As a woman from a working poor family, there were not a lot of options for her in terms of work.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tivdlh2mhIU At 18 years of age Kent entered the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart, which were known to be very progressive and welcomed creativity. Frances joined a teaching order, taking the name Sister Mary Corita. Initially she taught young children on an Inuit Reservation in British Columbia until returning to Los Angeles to study for her bachelor's degree at Immaculate Heart College and her master's degree at University of Southern California. She was the head of the art department at Immaculate Heart College. where she also taught a wide variety of different painting styles. Her artwork contained her own spiritual expression and love for her God. Sister Corita Kent's primary medium was silk screen, also known as Serigraphy. She became self-taught after she sent away for a DIY silk screening kit.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tivdlh2mhIU Her innovative methods pushed back the limitations of two-dimensional mediums of the times. Kent's emphasis on printing was partially due to her wish for democratic outreach, as she wished for affordable art for the masses. Her artwork, with its messages of love and peace, was particularly popular during the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s. After a cancer diagnosis in the early 1970s, she entered an extremely prolific period in her career, including the Rainbow Swash design on the LNG storage tank in Boston, and the 1985 version of the United States Postal Service's special Love stamp. In recent years, Corita has gained increased recognition for her role in the pop art movement. Critics and theorists previously failed to count her work as part of any mainstream \\"canon,\\" but in the last few years there has been a resurgence of attention given to Kent. As both a nun and a woman making art in the twentieth century, she was in many ways cast to the margins of the different movements she was a part of. Corita's art was her activism, and her spiritually-informed social commentary promoted love and tolerance. Early life and education Frances Elizabeth Kent was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa in 1918.Eye, Number 35, Volume 9, Spring 2000. Upon entering the Roman Catholic order of Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Los Angeles in 1936, Kent took the name Sister Mary Corita. She took classes at Otis (now Otis College of Art and Design) and Chouinard Art Institute and earned her BA from Immaculate Heart College in 1941. She earned her MA at the University of Southern California in Art History in 1951.  Career  Between 1938 and 1968 Kent lived and worked in the Immaculate Heart Community. She taught in the Immaculate Heart College and became the chair of its art department in 1964. Her classes at Immaculate Heart were an avant-garde mecca for prominent, ground-breaking artists and inventors, such as Alfred Hitchcock, John Cage, Saul Bass, Buckminster Fuller and Charles & Ray Eames. Kent credited Charles Eames, Buckminster Fuller, and art historian Dr. Alois Schardt for their important roles in her intellectual and artistic growth. By the early 1950s, she had such a unique and well-known aesthetic and teaching style that clergy members from all over the country were sent to be educated at Immaculate Heart College. Her students were drawn to her selflessness and unique teaching methods such as large class assignments like asking students to create 200 drawings or take three hours to draw their arm without looking at what they were creating. Kent toured widely the following decade. After the Second Vatican Council, Kent transformed Immaculate Heart College‚Äôs annual Mary‚Äôs Day procession into a community celebration which was part of the sister‚Äôs campaign to bring secular people together. During this time, Kent‚Äôs work became increasingly political, addressing events such as the Vietnam War and humanitarian crises. For example, she was commissioned by the Physicians for Social Responsibility to create what she called \\"we can create life without war\\" billboards. Tensions between the order and church leadership were mounting, with the Los Angeles archdiocese criticizing the college as \\"liberal\\" and Cardinal James McIntyre labeling the college as \\"communist\\" and Kent‚Äôs work as \\"blasphemous.\\" Due to this, Kent returned to secular life in 1968 as Corita Kent. Most sisters followed suit and the Immaculate Heart College closed in 1980. Corita Kent also embraced the many different revolutions going on in the world at this time. These revolutions were the Vietnam War, Civil Rights, and Women rights. Kent created several hundred serigraph designs, for posters, book covers, and murals. Her work includes the 1985 United States Postal Service stamp Love and the 1971 Rainbow Swash, the largest copyrighted work of art in the world, covering a high natural gas tank in Boston. She did not attend the unveiling of the Love stamp because she wanted it to happen at the United Nations and was not happy with the message that was sent when the design was unveiled on the Love Boat. Her 1985 work \\"love is hard work\\" was made in response. The stamp itself sold successfully- over 700 million times. Kent was also commissioned to create work for the 1964 World‚Äôs Fair in New York, and the 1965 IBM Christmas display in New York. Her 1951 print, The Lord is with Thee had won first prizes in printmaking at the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Science, Art, and at the California State Fair. Kent's work has been exhibited extensively beginning in 1952. By the 1960s, Kent had already shown work at 230 exhibitions across the country and her work was included in the collections the Achenbach Foundation Graphic Arts, the Fogg museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Art, the National Serigraph Society, the Norman Rockwell Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.Corita Kent - we care. 1966, serigraph. 36\\" x 30' Artistic style Corita Kent worked at the intersection of several powerful and at times contradictory cultural, political, and religious influences. Corita Kent, inspired by the works of Andy Warhol, began using popular culture as raw material for her work in 1962. Her screen prints often incorporated the archetypical product of brands of American consumerism alongside spiritual texts. Her design process involved appropriating an original advertising graphic to suit her idea; for example, she would tear, rip, or crumble the image, then re-photograph it. She often used grocery store signage, texts from scripture, newspaper clippings, song lyrics, and writings from literary greats such as Gertrude Stein, E. E. Cummings, and Albert Camus as the textual focal point of her work.Axell, Evelyne, and Angela Stief. \\"Sister Corita.\\" Power up - Female Pop Art: Evelyne Axell, Sister Corita, Christa Dichgans, Rosalyn Drexler, Jann Haworth, Dorothy Iannone, Kiki Kogelnik, Marisol, Niki De Saint Phalle; Kunsthalle Wien, 5. November 2010 Bis 20. Februar 2011, Phoenix Art. K√∂ln: Dumont, 2010. 151. E.E. Cummings was one of Kent's earliest and strongest influences. She quotes him in her work separately more than a dozen times and was inspired by a line from one of his lectures to create an entire series of alphabet prints. In her 1966 piece Tame It's Not, she uses quotes from Winnie the Pooh, Kierkegaard, and an ad slogan for men's cologne. Using everyday consumer bought items, like Wonderbread, she was able to bring words and thoughts about her religion to a familiar product that people saw and used everyday. By creating juxtaposition between formally acknowledged or respected \\"art\\" and the art Corita saw in her everyday world ‚Äì at the supermarket, on a walk, in the classroom ‚Äì she elevated the banal to the holy. \\"Like a priest, a shaman, a magician, she could pass her hands over the commonest of the everyday, the superficial, the oh-so-ordinary, and make it a vehicle of the luminous, the only, and the hope filled,\\" noted Corita's friend, theologian Harvey Cox. Corita's earliest work was mostly iconographic, drawing inspiration and material from the Bible and other religious sources. Her style is heavily text-based, scripture passages or positive quotes often encompassing entire compositions with bold and highly saturated typefaces. Despite the often surreal or disorienting compositions of her works, her pieces are \\"always about something.\\" By the 1960s, her work started becoming increasingly political. For example, her silkscreen print, stop the bombing(1967) is a large piece protesting the use of nuclear weaponry in bold, blue letters against a white and red background. Kent produced her oeuvre during her time at Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles in response to the Catholic reform in the 1960s by the Vatican Council II as well as several political and social issues happening at the time. Her work itself aided in the Vatican II movement, a movement to modernize and make relevant the Catholic Church. Kent‚Äôs use of English church texts in her work, for example, made an impact on the Vatican II‚Äôs efforts to normalize conducting Mass in English. Because of her strongly political art, she and others left their order to create the Immaculate Heart Community in 1970 to avoid problems with their archdiocese. The \\"Big G\\" logo that Kent appropriated from General Mills was to stress the idea of ‚Äògoodness‚Äô, while the elements from Esso gasoline ads were meant to project the internal power within humans. Unsurprisingly, a Christian subtext does underscore several of her artworks, but not all, which are open to interpretation. One of Kent‚Äôs prints, love your brother (1969), depicts photographs of Martin Luther King Jr. overlaid with her handwritten words, \\"The king is dead. Love your brother,\\" outlining one of her more serious artworks, and presenting her views on politics and human nature. Her collages took popular images, often with twisted or reversed words, to comment on the political unrest of the period, many of which could have been found at any number of marches or demonstrations, some of which she attended herself. Death and legacy Corita Kent was diagnosed with cancer in 1974. After this diagnosis, in the Back Bay of Boston, Kent confined her art to water color painting and only pursued printmaking if it was in order to say something substantiative. She died on September 18, 1986 in Watertown Massachusetts at the age of sixty-seven. She left her copyrights and unsold works to the Immaculate Heart College Community. She has had solo exhibitions at the National Museum of Women in the Arts and is shown in several art museums with some including the Whitney, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art as well as private collectors. An archive is dedicated to her at the Immaculate Heart High School in Los Feliz, LA. Some of Sister Corita's papers and early artwork are in Schlesinger Library, in the Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. Recent solo exhibitions of Kent's work include: Someday is Now: The Art of Corita Kent at the Tang Museum at Skidmore College, There Will Be New Rules Next Week at Dundee Contemporary Arts. The Corita Art Center, a gallery and archive dedicated to preserving and promoting the work and spirit of Corita Kent, was founded in 1997 is located on the campus of Immaculate Heart High School in Los Feliz, Los Angeles.

He is best known for his role as leader of the band, Le Grand Kall√© et l'African Jazz, in which capacity he was involved in a number of noted songs, including Ind√©pendance Cha Cha. Background Le Grand Kall√© was born Joseph Athanase Tchamala Kabasele in Matadi, Bas-Congo in what was then the Belgian Congo, modern Democratic Republic of Congo. He came from a prominent Congolese family, which included Cardinal Joseph Malula Kall√© went to secondary school and became a typist at a succession of commercial firms in the capital of the Belgian Congo, L√©opoldville. Career He started his music in st. Anne in the school's choir where he mate victor longomba. he was leaving in the city town of kinshasa .he was 16 years old when he met Joseph Benatar studio owner than he found Dechaud Mwamba and dr. Niko.In the early 1950s at a new recording studio called Opika he received an opportunity to pursue a career in music. His first group was OTC, led by George Doula. In 1953, disillusioned with the lack of modernisation at OTC, he formed l'African Jazz, which some consider to be the most important Congolese band. L'African Jazz was one of the most popular early African Rumba bands. At its height, L'African Jazz included big names like guitarist Dr Nico Kasanda, saxophonist Manu Dibango and singers Tabu Ley Rochereau, Sam Mangwana and Pepe Kalle. In 1960, he established his own label, Subourboum Jazz, which was home to Franco Luambo's TPOK Jazz. Grand Kall√© was responsible for striking deals with European record labels to ensure high quality recordings of his band's music for the Francophone market. In the mid-1960s, Kall√© suffered his first major setback when two of his proteg√©s (Tabu Ley Rochereau and Dr Nico Kasanda) left to form their own group called Africa Fiesta. Kall√© never recovered from this setback, concentrating on nurturing the talent of singer P√©p√© Kall√©. Political influence As a prominent figure in the Belgian Congo, Kall√© was chosen as a member of the Congolese delegation at the \\"Round Table Conference\\" on Congolese independence in 1960. He composed several songs on a political themes, notably \\"Ind√©pendance Cha Cha\\" and \\"Table Ronde\\". Death Le Grande Kall√© died in a hospital in Paris, France, on 11 February 1983.

Westphalia has a strong German and Catholic background. The Church of the Visitation was, until recently, the largest wooden church west of the Mississippi River. Westphalia is mainly noted for its historic church and convents, but also for its meat market and for its annual church picnic, which is one of the largest in the area.WESTPHALIA, TEXAS Handbook of Texas Online Westphalia is also known for the Westphalia Waltz.Westphalia Waltz by Clay Coppedge, Texas Escapes The Westphalia Independent School District serves area students. Westphalia Rural Historic District The entire town of Westphalia, along with a large swath of surrounding countryside is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) since 1996 as the Westphalia Rural Historic District. The district lies at the center of a broader rural farming community culturally bound through German Catholic traditions. The town of Westphalia is home to the region's Catholic parish, the religious institutions supported by the parish, the schools, and commercial businesses that grew up to serve local farmers. Outside of Westphalia, the district holds 35 historic farmsteads containing late 19th- and early 20th-century residential and agricultural buildings still retaining a high degree of integrity in their environment, design, materials, and workmanship. Westphalia, never formally platted or incorporated, historically is situated along three principal streets, and is composed of four distinct sections. Church Road, now known as County Road 3000, forms a northern district featuring the Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin and its rectory and parish hall, cemetery, schools, and a former convent. These structures were formerly on large lots, but in later years, residential infill has been added. The Main Village Road, now CR 366 and CR 380, was the center of the town's commercial development at the intersections of the other two streets until 1938 when State Highway 320 (SH 320) was constructed through town, reorienting the town's business settlement pattern. Cotton Gin Road, now CR 366 south of CR 380, led to the cotton gin that served as Westphalia's only industrial infrastructure on the southwest of town. Initially, the town's residences formed the fourth section along the Main Village Rd. east of and near the commercial center. Outside of town, agrarian lands within the district were originally structured in a rectangular grid pattern with roughly tracts broken only by wooded areas along streams and later by the diagonal path of SH 320. Although some large tracts have been further subdivided beginning in the 1910s, the modern county road network along with fence lines and their associated vegetation respect this historically rectangular framework. Common land uses including widespread corn, cotton, and livestock production along with shared agricultural practices including seasonally consistent farming methods give the farmsteads a uniform appearance that reflects its late 19th-century appearance. The twin steeples of the Church of the Visitation in Westphalia form a commanding presence, being visible from most locations throughout the district. The district contains 283 contributing resources, including 188 buildings, 43 sites, 50 structures, and two objects along with 127 total noncontributing resources. The district's NRHP registration form specifies the following properties as being representative of the district including one that is also a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark (RTHL): *The Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin, Church Rd. (CR 3000) ‚Äî Constructed from 1894-1895, the church follows a Latin cross plan measuring with a by transept. The building has a symmetrical facade dominated by twin bell towers topped by copper-clad domes and Maltese crosses, a common German symbol, along with Gothic windows and fish-scale shingles. The church's design and construction are reminiscent of the German Westphalia region that was the homeland of the town's immigrant pioneers, although the church is more subdued than most similar churches in the town's namesake region. Restoration efforts have provided a distinctive blue and white paint scheme of folk patterns evident in early photographs. The church's interior includes stained-glass windows and a painting on the ceiling of angels, stars, comets, and the moon. A concrete-lined cistern, a remnant of the town's early water supply, is also a historic element of the property. The church was destroyed by a fire on July 29, 2019 *St. Mary's Cemetery, Church Rd. (CR 3000) ‚Äî The cemetery was established around 1895 on a slightly sloping hill within the church's original tract; however, the first recorded grave was dug there earlier in 1884. Although some graves are covered with grass, most are neatly graveled in family plots surrounded by low curbs with gravel pathways between. Headstones face east toward the church, and many older headstones have German inscriptions and are topped with Maltese crosses, providing visual continuity with the church towers. Dominating the center of the cemetery is a bronze statue of the crucified Christ donated by local families and imported from France in 1908. Between the statue and the cemetery entrance is a file of seven concrete slabs, also facing east, covering the graves of former parish priests. A ceremonial wrought-iron arch installed around 1950 marks the entrance. The original wrought-iron fencing remains on the north side, while the rest has been removed due to expansion. A chain-link fence along the rear of the cemetery marks the boundary of the church tract. *Westphalia Little School, Church Rd. (CR 3000) ‚Äî This school, built in 1896 likely incorporating ruins from the later of two previous church buildings, is located on the hill near the present church. The vernacular frame building is similar to center-passage dwellings commonly built at the time. The three-room school includes a wing added to the rear typical of the expansion of the area's farmhouses. Other design features common in contemporary structures include the school's pedimented entry portico, fish-scale shingles, and double-hung sash with pedimented surrounds. The building continued serving as a school until 1989. *Minnie Hoelscher House, Church Rd. (CR 3000) ‚Äî This house, built before 1890, is the earliest known residence within Westphalia and belonged to Minnie Hoelscher, a dressmaker and milliner. The 1-story, two- room home was typical of many contemporary farmhouses. Modest adornments include turned porch brackets and paired turned posts. Despite the home's modest size, Miss Hoelscher opened her home to boarders. The agricultural property also includes a barn, shed, and well. *Dr. B.A. and Katie Jansing House, Main Village Rd. (CR 366) ‚Äî This 1921 home is a one-story bungalow located in the town's commercial heart. The house is located on a lot, typical of homes on Westphalia's main road, and belonged to a prominent, long-time physician upon whom the town highly depended. The primary contractor was Tom Roberts of Lott with assistance from Will Ranly of Westphalia. The house demonstrates Craftsman influences, including geometric gable ornamentation, simple box columns, triangular knee braces, and a battered foundational skirt. Despite the addition of asbestos siding in the post-World War II period, a common practice at the time, the home's historical elements remain recognizable. *Hoelscher/Thornton Store, Main Village Rd. (CR 366) ‚Äî Built in 1907, the Hoelscher/Thornton Store is distinguished as the oldest remaining commercial building in the historic district. The main entrance of the one- story frame building faces the Main Village Rd., while a secondary, rear entrance has been opened toward SH 320. The false-fronted main facade features a stepped parapet of horizontal boards, and the structure retains its original architectural features, building materials, and interior design. The store originally sold dry goods with groceries sold in a separate building since consumed by fire. Descendants of the original owners still own and operate the business, which continues to serve as a gathering spot for townsfolk. *Stefka/Hoelscher/Doskocil Cotton Gin, Cotton Gin Rd. (CR 366) ‚Äî The cotton gin was built around 1930 on the southwestern edge of town abutting extensive cotton fields. This gin replaced an earlier one located about to the west. The original cruciform plan of the gin remains recognizable despite numerous technological alterations both contributing and not contributing to its historical integrity. The cotton gin remains operational and continues to serve the local agricultural community. *Christopher and Mary Fuchs Farmstead, SH 320 ‚Äî Christopher and Mary Fuchs, immigrants from Germany, obtained title to a formerly tract upon which this farmstead sits in 1890 and finished payments for the property by 1900, although by this time, they no longer farmed. The farmhouse is among the oldest buildings in the district, and the current farmstead property includes more than a dozen outbuildings. The historic structures of the farmstead represent all significant historic periods of the district and remain largely unaltered, rendering the farmstead an epitome of first-generation Westphalia farms. The original farmstead has been subdivided through inheritance and subjected to land swaps among the descendants of the Fuchs family, leaving the current property with the original farmhouse on a parcel of . This acreage includes of cropland and of pastureland which itself contains of prairie grass in a hay meadow that has never been plowed. This expanse of indigenous grassland is a rarity, lending this property special significance within the district's historic context. The farmstead conforms to common local patterns with a building complex centrally located within the cultivated fields. A barbed-wire fence with cedar posts and lined with wild vegetation runs along a dirt road between the fields and the building compound. Decorative wire fencing separates the barnyard from the main house's yard, which is planted with large trees, roses, and other flower beds. The 1890-era family domicile itself is a 1-story frame house built in the region's common center-passage style with a rear ell. A full-length porch fronts a five-bay fa√ßade and features chamfered posts, a gabled roof with twin dormers, and a side-lighted central front door. A hard-packed drive separates the house from the barnyard structures. These include a rectangular, one-story chicken coop with a chimney allowing for chick incubation as early as January. Four hog pens are made up of double pens with frame fencing. Several large animal barns of one and two stories and a 1-story barn with a hay loft also remain. Other barnyard historic features include storage and garage outbuildings, a plot for vegetable and flower cultivation, a well, and an old privy. Historic barnyard structures are of frame construction with either wood shingle or metal roofs, while noncontributing structures, built since the 1960s, are of metal construction. *Anton Jansing Estate, CR 372 ‚Äî Anton Jansing was one of the earliest German Catholic settlers arriving in 1888, and helped establish the parish church before his death 10 years later. Although the house and some outbuildings remain intact, the historic nature of the surrounding fields has been obscured by modern commercial agriculture. The present farmstead, part of what was originally a tract, is dominated by the farmhouse built around 1890. The home, built on a center-passage plan, features a pedimented front door with transom and side lights, pedimented windows, and a pedimented front porch with fish-scale shingles. Across a hard- packed drive leading to the county road from the main house is the barnyard compound. This once more substantial complex holds three remaining main buildings that are historically similar to other structures within the district. These are a two-story hay and animal barn with board corrals and open cattle bays, a one-story frame barn, and a metal garage with hasp-hinged doors. *Elizabeth Biemer Farmstead, CR 378 ‚Äî This farmstead, with a house built around 1915, is considered a typical example of a second-generation property within the district. Elizabeth Biemer was a German immigrant whose native-born Texan husband died within a few years after acquiring this property, leaving her to tend the farm along with her four children. This is an early 20th-century standard-plan house with a high-pitched, hipped roof. Historic outbuildings include a one-story frame barn and a one-story garage with large hasp-hung doors. Noncontributing modern structures include a shed, a metal barn, and a cattle feeder. Elsewhere, the fence lines and tree-shaded pasture enhance the farm's historic character, while an intensely cultivated field is a detraction. *Joseph and Clothilde Kahlig Farmstead, CR 378 ‚Äî Joseph A. Kahlig obtained this property in 1884 and lived with his wife in a small log house along a creek until building the farmhouse around 1890. The farmhouse, very representative of others in the district and one of the oldest, is a 1-story central-passage structure with a rear ell. Among the outbuildings are a two-story metal hay barn, a 1-story metal animal barn, a one-story frame root cellar, a tractor barn, a buggy barn, a chicken house, a pig pen, and a working well. These are part of an elevated building complex, while other landscape aspects of the farm include an expanse of flat land for cotton cultivation and a grassy slope and large stock pond for cattle grazing. *G.P. Hoelscher Farmstead, CR 388 ‚Äî This farmstead was originally part of a subsequently divided tract. The farmstead contains 10 historic buildings along with an ornamental garden, while a second house on another subdivided section of the original property dates to 1908. The G.P. Hoelscher House, built around 1890, is yet another central-passage dwelling common in the district. This 1-story house is very similar to the Christopher Fuchs House with three gabled dormers and a front porch that was replaced during the district's period of historic interest. Surrounding the home is a yard common among homes in the district with a decorative metal gate and fencing enclosure with symmetrical plantings of trees and shrubs. Rose bushes are planted along the east side of the house, while the front porch is flanked with holly and crape myrtles. Pecan trees shade the house from each of the fence corners. Among the outbuildings are a 1-story frame hay barn, a 1-story frame garage with hasp hinged doors, a one-story tractor shed, a one-story frame corn crib, a hen house, a frame privy, a brick cistern and concrete-sheathed brick well, and a hot water house/wash house. This building complex again is placed upon an elevated place within the farmstead, which also features cedar-post fence rows and a timber stand along a creek. *Henry Meyer Farmstead, CR 386 ‚Äî Despite the dilapidated state of much of this property, it remains sufficiently intact to demonstrate crucial elements of the district's historical traditions. The farmhouse is in an I-layout design, the only remaining such structure in the district, although the layout was formerly more common among vernacular buildings in the area, including a nonextant former church rectory. This building, dating from around 1900, also has a vernacular central-passage design with a rear ell. The two-story house has a collapsed full-width porch, unfortunately representative of other vacant historic properties in the district. The home's yard includes a concrete-sheathed brick well and a deteriorated frame privy. Outbuildings include a three-bay 1-story hay barn, a one-story frame shed, and an open-sided animal barn with corrals. The concrete foundation of a sanitary pit toilet constructed around 1935 by the Works Progress Administration is located nearby. *Frank J. and Julia Buckholt Farmstead (RTHL #13048), CR 379 ‚Äî Frank Bockholt inherited this portion of the original farm from his father, alternatively known as either Alois or Johann Bockholt, and his mother Theresia. This 1912 home is considered a second- generation house within the district. The house incorporates elements of the previous two-room home built by Frank Buckholt's parents, who settled in the area in 1881 and in which Buckholt was raised since his birth in 1884. After studying music at St. Edward's in Austin, Buckholt returned home to be the organist for 52 years at the Catholic church and director of the men's choir. The 1-story hipped roof bungalow house built in 1912 of American Four Square design represents a style between Craftsman and late Victorian that remains largely unaltered. The home was constructed by carpenters Crier and Sapp. What remains of the farm's outbuildings of frame construction with either board- and-batten or vertical board design include a two-story hay and cattle barn, two one-story chicken houses, a one-story garage and work shed, and a one- story storage and garage building. A metal feed silo and a few pig pens complete the barnyard building complex separated from the house by a field road. Beyond these, the historic nature of cultivated areas has effectively been destroyed due to leasing to modern agricultural interests that have disrupted traditional field patterns and removed fence rows.

He was later the author of more than a dozen books about spirituality, and Sufism in particular. Life and career Feild was born in Hascombe, Surrey, England, the son of Violet Esm√© \\"Mouse\\" (Bentley) and Armstead Littlejohn Feild. As a young, upper-class Englishman, Feild was educated at Eton and served in the Royal Navy, where he had an undistinguished career. In the early 1960s, Feild formed a folk duo, the Kensington Squares, with Dion O'Brien, later known as Tom Springfield. When the duo added Dion's sister Mary, they became the Springfields, with Mary becoming known as Dusty Springfield. The trio had minor pop hits in Britain before Feild left in late 1962; he was replaced by Mike Hurst. Mark Deming, \\"The Springfields\\", Allmusic.com. Retrieved 4 October 2016 Feild was influenced by the spiritual teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, and others. He studied spiritual healing, and was involved with the Alice Bailey community. In the late 1960s, he was initiated as a sheikh in the Sufi Order International by Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan. Feild studied with Bulent Rauf, a Turkish author and translator descended from a line of Sufi masters going back to the Andalusian mystic Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi (1165‚Äì1240). He established the Beshara Centre at Swyre Farm in Aldsworth, England, in 1970. A description of events at this center is given in the books I, Wabenzi by Rafi Zabor, and Beshara and Ibn 'Arabi: A Movement of Sufi Spirituality in the Modern World. In December 1971, he and a group of students went to Konya, Turkey, to meet Bulent and the sema of the Mevlevi order of Dervishes. While there, he met Sheikh Suleiman (S√ºleyman) Dede. In 1972 Feild resigned his role in the Sufi Order. In 1973, he resigned his role leading the Beshara CentreBeshara moved to Scotland in 1975. Cf. www.beshara.org. and went to Los Angeles, Tepoztlan, Mexico, and Vancouver Island, BC, where he taught on his own. In 1976, he was made a sheikh in the Mevlevi order by Suleiman Dede. This was a revolutionary move, as a Dede of the Mevlevi Order had never bestowed the title of a Sheikh before ‚Äì Only a Chelebi Efendi, the head of the Mevlevi Order, could bestow such a title. In light of this, Feild's presence as a Mevlevi Sheikh would not have been acknowledged by the central governing of the Mevlevi Order, and could be best viewed as a transformatory off-shoot of the Order. After receiving the rank of Sheikh, Reshad Feild moved to Boulder, Colorado, where he started a small centre. In Boulder Reshad assisted in introducing the sema ceremony ‚Äì which was declared a cultural world heritage activity by UNESCO in 2004 ‚Äì to America and Europe, and made it available to women for the first time in recent history, as well as non-Muslim participants (i.e. students). Later, Feild taught on the essence of the universality of Sufi teachings, making them available to people of all religious and spiritual backgrounds. He published more than a dozen books, some of which have been translated into many languages. In his autobiographical novel The Last Barrier, he gave a fictionalised account of how he met Bulent Rauf. He was the father of the actor JJ Feild.

Holmes was a highly physical player and being taller and heavier than most scrum halves of the time, he was known for his frequent close range tries especially following pick up from the back of the scrum and the break down. Holmes was a member of the first round of players to be inducted into the Cardiff RFC Hall of Fame. Background Terry Holmes was born in Cardiff, Wales.  Youth career  Holmes joined the Cardiff Youth side at the age of sixteen and also played for Wales Youth from 1974 to 1976 and in that time won a record number of caps.Welsh Rugby Union Official Program -Wales v England Saturday 20th April 1985 at page 9.  Cardiff RFC  Holmes played his entire rugby union career at Cardiff, the city of his birth. Following his appearances for the Youth team he appeared 193 times for the senior Cardiff RFC team, scoring 123 tries and was a key figure in the very successful Cardiff team during that period. During Holmes' time at Cardiff, the team won the Welsh Cup in 1981,1982 and 1984 and were finalists in 1977 and 1985. Holmes was club captain for the 1984-5 season.  Wales and the British and Irish Lions  At the age of 21, Holmes was given the task of filling the Wales scrum-half position after the retirement of Gareth Edwards, and he won his first cap for Wales in 1978 against , scoring a try. He went on to play in the Triple Crown winning side of 1979. He won 25 caps for Wales playing his last match against in 1985, and scored 9 tries for Wales. He captained Wales for five matches in 1985 before leaving rugby union later that same year. Holmes also played for the British and Irish Lions on their 1980 tour to South Africa and 1983 tour to New Zealand. He made one Test appearance (against New Zealand in 1983, the Lions losing 16-12) but was forced to return home early through injury from both tours. In late 1985, Holmes quit rugby union when he joined Bradford Northern. After retirement, Holmes coached Cardiff RFC and then Caerphilly rugby union teams, resigning as Caerphilly coach owing to business commitments in 2002. Rugby League and County Cup Final appearances In late 1985, Holmes became one of the biggest names of the time to turn professional, when he joined Bradford Northern for ¬£80,000 (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£309,200 in 2018).. However injuries meant that he only played 40 games for the club before his retirement two years later. He scored nine tries. Terry Holmes played (replaced by interchange/substitute Neil Roebuck) in Bradford Northern's 12‚Äì12 draw with Castleford in the 1987 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1987‚Äì88 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 17 October 1987, but he did not play in the 11‚Äì2 victory over Castleford in the 1987 Yorkshire County Cup Final replay during the 1987‚Äì88 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 31 October 1987.

Standing at 31 metres tall atop a small knoll on which parts of the campus was built on, the building was completed as part of the campus of The Chinese High School in 1925, funded by generous donations from the Chinese community leaders. It served as an imposing landmark for the Bukit Timah area where it is surrounded by relatively low-rise private housing estates. It was used in tactical military situations during the Pacific War in World War II. Its strategic location atop a hill gave any troops stationed in it a good view of the island. It was used by the Allied defenders during the Battle of Singapore, as well as during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, it was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army for the purpose of surveillance. The tower's four-faced clock was destroyed and removed during World War II, and was restored in the early 1970s, with replacements donated by Seiko. The clock tower went through a series of restoration and expansion in the 1990s, in which a new library was added. On 19 March 1999, two days before the 80th anniversary of the school, the clock tower was gazetted as a national monument, to mark the significance of the institution as the first Chinese- medium secondary school to be built in Southeast Asia catering to the Overseas Chinese by its founder, Mr Tan Kah Kee.  Architecture & Facilities  The Clock Tower Building is a work by Swan & Maclaren, a renowned firm that also designed the Sultan Mosque, the Former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, Civilian War Memorial, and Raffles Hotel. Neoclassical architectural elements, including a symmetrical plan, the frontal triangular pediment, stately Ionic columns, and arched doorways and windows form distinctive traits of the iconic building. The 36-metre-high clock tower and a cupola, supported by eight small Ionic columns, crowns the tower.

Its full name in the Khmer language is Preah Barum Reachea Veang Chaktomuk Serei Mongkol (). The Kings of Cambodia have occupied it since it was built in the 1860s, with a period of absence when the country came into turmoil during and after the reign of the Khmer Rouge. The palace was constructed between 1866 and 1870, after King Norodom relocated the royal capital from Oudong to Phnom Penh. It was built atop an old citadel called Banteay Kev. It faces approximately East and is situated at the Western bank of the cross division of the Tonle Sap River and the Mekong River called Chaktomuk (an allusion to Brahma).  History  The original Throne Hall of the palace, postcard dated 1909, This building was demolished in 1915. The current Throne Hall, occupying the same site but considerably larger, was inaugurated in 1919. The Chan Chhaya Pavilion in 1885 and a now-removed bastion. The establishment of the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh in 1866 is a comparatively recent event in the history of the Khmer and Cambodia. The seat of Khmer power in the region rested in or near Angkor north of the Great Tonle Sap Lake from 802 AD until the early 15th century. After the Khmer court moved from Angkor in the 15th century after destroyed by Siam, it first settled in Phnom Penh which back then named as Krong Chatomok Serei Mongkol () in 1434 (or 1446) and stayed for some decades, but by 1494 had moved on to Basan, and later Longvek and then Oudong. The capital did not return to Phnom Penh until the 19th century and there is no record or remnants of any Royal Palace in Phnom Penh prior to the 19th century. In 1813, King Ang Chan (1796‚Äì1834) constructed Banteay Kev (the 'Crystal Citadel') on the site of the current Royal Palace and stayed there very briefly before moving to Oudong. Banteay Kev was burned in 1834 when the retreating Siamese army razed Phnom Penh. It was not until after the implementation of the French Protectorate in Cambodia in 1863 that the capital was moved from Oudong to Phnom Penh, and the current Royal Palace was founded and constructed. At the time that King Norodom (1860‚Äì1904) the eldest son of King Ang Duong, who ruled on behalf of Siam, signed the Treaty of Protection with France in 1863, the capital of Cambodia resided at Oudong, about 45 kilometres northeast of Phnom Penh. Earlier in 1863 a temporary wooden Palace was constructed a bit north of the current Palace site in Phnom Penh. The first Royal Palace to be built at the present location was designed by architect Neak Okhna Tepnimith Mak and constructed by the French Protectorate in 1866. On the year of 1865, year of the cow, at nine o'clock in the morning, King Norodom moved the Royal court from Oudong to the new Royal Palace in Phnom Penh and the city became the official capital of Cambodia the following year. Over the next decade several buildings and houses were added, many of which have since been demolished and replaced, including an early Chanchhaya Pavilion and Throne Hall (1870). The Royal court was installed permanently at the new Royal Palace in 1871 and the walls surrounding the grounds were raised in 1873. Many of the buildings of the Royal Palace, particularly of this period, were constructed using a combination of traditional Khmer architectural but also incorporating significant European features and design as well. One of the most unusual surviving structures from this period is the iron-sided Napoleon Pavilion which was a gift from France in 1876. It is currently closed to the public for renovations because of its poor state of conservation. King Sisowath (1904‚Äì1927) made several major contributions to the current Royal Palace, adding the Phochani Hall in 1907 (inaugurated in 1912), and from 1913-1919 demolishing several old buildings, and replacing and expanding the old Chanchhaya Pavilion and the Throne Hall with the current structures. These buildings employ traditional Khmer artistic style and Angkorian inspired design, particularly in the Throne Hall, though some European elements remain. The next major construction came in the 1930s under King Monivong with the addition of the Royal Chapel, Vihear Suor (1930), and the demolition and replacement of the old Royal residence with the Khemarin Palace (1931), which serves as the official Royal residence to this day. From the reign of King Sihanouk, other significant additions are the 1956 addition of the Villa Kantha Bopha to accommodate foreign guests, and the 1953 construction of the Damnak Chan originally installed to house the High Council of the Throne.  Buildings of the Royal Palace  The complex is divided by walls into four main compounds. On the south side is the Silver Pagoda, to the north side is the Khemarin Palace and the central compound contains the Throne Hall and to the west is the private sector or the Inner Court. The buildings of the palace were built gradually over time, and some were dismantled and rebuilt as late as the 1960s. Some older buildings date back to the 19th century. Tonle Sap-Mekong River.  Architecture and Area  The Royal Palace of Cambodia is a fine example of Khmer architecture with a slight French touch featuring its layout of the defensive wall (kampaeng), throne hall (preah tineang), Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Preah Keo Morakot), stupas (chedei), towering spires (prang prasat) and mural paintings. The Royal Palace of Phnom Penh covers an area of (402m x 435m). = Throne Hall = The Preah Tineang Tevea Vinnichay Mohai Moha Prasat or \\"Throne Hall\\" () means the \\"Sacred Seat of Judgement.\\" Throne Room The Throne Hall is where the king's confidants, generals and royal officials once carried out their duties. It is still in use today as a place for religious and royal ceremonies (such as coronationshttp://www.frommers.com/destinations/phnom-penh/attractions/213907 and royal weddings) as well as a meeting place for guests of the King. The cross-shaped building is crowned with three spires. The central, 59-metre spire is topped with the white, four-faced head of Brahma. Inside the Throne Hall contains three royal thrones (one is more of western style and the other two are traditional) and golden busts of Cambodians kings and queens starting from the reign of King Ang Doung onwards. This Throne Hall is the second to be built on this site. The first was constructed in 1869-1870 under King Norodom. That Throne Hall was demolished in 1915. The present building was constructed in 1917 and inaugurated by King Sisowath in 1919. The building is 30x60 metres. As with all buildings and structure at the Palace, the Throne Hall faces east and is best photographed in the morning. When visiting note the thrones (Reach Balaing in front and Preah Thineang Bossabok higher at the back) and the beautiful ceiling frescoes of the Reamker. To the north of the thrones stands the statue of His Majesty Sisowath Monivong standing holding the Royal Sword. The statue is made with gold and shows him dressed in casual clothes. While to the south of the thrones stands the gold statue of His Majesty King Sisowath sitting on the Preah Thineang Bossabok dressed and covered with the Royal Regalia of Cambodia (as you can see he is wearing the Crown, the Sopourna Bat or the royal footwear and in his right hand holds the Royal Sword. He sits on the Preah Thineang Bossabok which is made to look like the real one to the right. The traditional throne or The Preah Tineang Bossabok () is an ancient nine-level classical Khmer-style throne. Each Khmer King has to be seated on it on the coronation day while wearing the Royal Regalia. It is covered with intricate floral carvings and has two levels of small statues of Garudas lifting the upper part of the bossabok. Three of the nine levels of the throne represent the levels of hell, middle earth and the heavens. Surrounding the bossabok are the four gold nine-tiered umbrellas, these are called the Aphirom (Khmer: ·û¢·ûó·û∑·ûö·ûò·üí·ûô). Finally, the bossabok is topped by the white Royal Nine-tiered umbrella () that signifies the universal power the king has. In front of the bossabok is the throne. The table that stands next to the Royal Throne holds on it a golden tea set and the golden set of betel and areca nuts container set, which are part of the regalia and are always on the table, or otherwise called the Pean Preah Srei (Khmer: ·ûñ·û∂·ûì·ûñ·üí·ûö·üá·ûü·üí·ûö·û∏). Behind the preah thineang bossabok is another bossabok called the Preah Tineang Nearyrath Sophea (), the Preah Thineang Bossabok is for the king and the Preah Thineang Nearyrath Sophea at the back is for the queen. Like every king has to sit on the front bossabok, every queen also needs to sit on the taller bossabok behind. After sitting on the bossaboks while wearing the regalia, the kings and queens will be escorted to their palanquins to be paraded around the city. 700px = Moonlight Pavilion = Moonlight Pavilion The Preah Thineang Chan Chhaya () or \\"Moonlight Pavilion\\", is an open-air pavilion that serves as stage for Khmer classical dance in the past and present. It is one of the most notable buildings of the palace as it easily seen from the outside as it was built alongside a section of the palace walls. The Chan Chhaya Pavilion has a balcony that was used as a platform for viewing parades marching along Sothearos Boulevard of Phnom Penh. The current Pavilion is the second incarnation of the Chanchhaya Pavilion, this one constructed in 1913‚Äì14 under King Sisowath to replace the earlier wooden pavilion built under King Norodom. The current pavilion is of a similar design as the earlier version. The Chanchhaya Pavilion dominates the facade of the Palace on Sothearos Blvd. The Pavilion serves as a venue for the Royal Dancers, as a tribune for the King to address the crowds and as a place to hold state and Royal banquets. Most recently, the Pavilion was used for a banquet and a tribune for the new King at the 2004 coronation of King Norodom Sihamoni. = Silver Pagoda = Silver Pagoda The Silver Pagoda is a compound located on the South side of the palace complex. It features a royal temple officially called Preah Vihear Preah Keo Morakot () but is commonly referred to as Wat Preah Keo (). Its main building houses many national treasures such as gold and jeweled Buddha statues. Most notable is a small crystal Buddha (the \\"Emerald Buddha\\" of Cambodia) ‚Äì undetermined whether made of Baccarat Crystal in 19th century or of other kind of crystal in 17th century ‚Äì and a near-life-size, Maitreya Buddha encrusted with 9,584 diamonds dressed in royal regalia commissioned by King Sisowath. During King Sihanouk's pre-Khmer Rouge reign, the Silver Pagoda was inlaid with more than 5,000 silver tiles and some of its outer facade was remodelled with Italian marble. There are also other structures surrounding the main building or the vihear. To the east is the statue of King Norodom sits on a white horse. To the north of the vihear is the library. At the northwestern corner is the bell tower and south of that is the model of Angkor Wat. South of the vihear stand four structures: from west to east the Chedi (stupa) of H.M. King Suramarit and Queen Kossamak, the Dharmasala, the Chedi of Princess Kantha Bupha and The Phnom Mondop (mount mondop) where the statue of Preah Ko is situated. The wall that surrounds the structures is covered with the painting of the epic story of Reamker but because neglected care, the bottom half of the painting faded throughout the years. Khemarin Palace, the official residence of the King of Cambodia = Khemarin Palace = The Khemarin Palace is the common English name for a building called Khemarin Moha Prasat () [Prasat (temple or palace) Khmer + Indra] or in Khmer meaning the \\"Palace of the Khmer King.\\" It is used as an official residence of the King of Cambodia. This compound is separated from other buildings by a small wall and is located to the right of the Throne Hall. The main building is topped with a single spired prang. = Other structures = Other structures include, Hor Samran Phirun, Hor Samrith Phimean, Damnak Chan, Phochani Pavilion (dance hall), Serey Monkol Pavilion (royal conference hall), King Jayavarman VII Pavilion, Vihear Suor (royal chapel), Villa Kantha Bopha, Villa Chumpou, Villa Sahametrei, and some less significant buildings in an area closed to the public.

The Royal Palace today  The Royal Palace has had some major modifications to its buildings over time; nearly all of the King Norodom era buildings have been demolished completely. The King's living area (closed to public) has also undergone big changes. In the 1960s at Queen Kossamak's command the Silver Pagoda was rebuilt due to the original aging structure being too weak to stand. The palace has always been a popular tourist attraction in Phnom Penh. Visitors are able to wander around the Silver Pagoda compoundhttp://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia/phnom-penh/sights/castles- palaces-mansions/royal-palace and the central compound containing the Throne Hallhttp://www.lonelyplanet.com/cambodia/phnom-penh/sights/castles-palaces- mansions/royal-palace and Chan Chhaya Pavilion. The King's living area, which actually takes up half of the total palace ground area, including Khemarin Palace, Villa Kantha Bopha, Serey Mongkol Pavilion, royal gardens, and a number of other buildings and pavilions, is closed to the public.

It represents the juvenile gametophyte. While the protonema is growing by apical cell division, at some stage, under the influence of the phytohormone cytokinin, buds are induced which grow by three- faced apical cells. These give rise to gametophores, stems and leaf like structures (bryophytes do not have true leaves (megaphyll). Protonema are characteristic of all mosses and some liverworts but are absent from hornworts. Protonemata of mosses are composed of two cell types: chloronemata, which form upon germination, and caulonemata, which later differentiate from chloronemata and on which buds are formed, which then differentiate to gametophores.

History Network and networked learning theories can be traced back into the 19th Century, when commentators were considering the social implications of networked infrastructure such as the railways and the telegraph.\\"The first of these, the old Saint-Simonian 'cult of networks', feeds the contemporary desire for a horizontality of social links. The 19th century was characterized by the building of many network infrastructures ‚Äì telegraph, railway, electricity ‚Äì and a corresponding egalitarian ideology. Applying the French Revolution ideology to an industrial ground, Saint-Simon, who was both engineer and philosopher, built a theory of the network as the best means to connect people and to strengthen citizenship (Musso, 2003).\\" Musso, P.

But it can also be used for the telephone or the postal service, which are primarily accessible to individuals who want to send messages to one another. I wish we had another word to designate such reticular structures for mutual access, a word less evocative of entrapment, less degraded by current usage and more suggestive of the fact that any such arrangement includes legal, organizational, and technical aspects. Not having found such a term, I will try to redeem the one which is available, using it as a synonym of \\"educational web.\\" Ivan Illich, 1971Ivan Illich.

Conceive of all these situations as forming the backbone of the learning process; survey all these situations, describe them, and publish them as the city's \\"curriculum\\"; then let students, children, their families and neighborhoods weave together for themselves the situations that comprise their \\"school\\" paying as they go with standard vouchers, raised by community tax.

In the first phase of the Internet its use for networked learning was restricted by low bandwidth and the emphasis was largely on written and text based interactions between people and the text based resources they referred to. This textual form of interaction was a familiar academic medium, even though there was recognition of the unique qualities hypertext emerging in the online form.Harasim, L. (Ed.). (1990).

Harasim (Eds.), Online education: Perspectives on a new environment. New York: Praeger. In 1991, Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger published Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation, in which they cited numerous examples of networked learning within a wide range of settings for informal learning and within communities of practice.Lave. J, Wenger, E. (1991). Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation. Cambridge University Press In the later half of the 1990s, open, interactive, situated and networked views of learning were marginalised by educational institutions as they tended to develop or deploy content and practice through proprietary learning management systems (e.g. Blackboard Inc, WebCT), and collaborative work tools such as IBM Lotus Notes/Learning Space and Quick Place), generally following concepts around \\"e-learning\\". These systems enabled the restriction of access and the management of students for the administrative concerns of educational institutions. Watson, W. & Watson, S. (2007).

TechTrends, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2007, 51(2), pp.28-34. https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00692067/document Since 1998, an international Networked Learning Conference has been held biannually. The conference proceedings from all the conferences since 2002 are available via the conference web site. CSALT, a research group at Lancaster University, UK, associated with the Networked Learning Conference series and several edited collections, defined networked learning as \\"learning in which information and communication technology is used to promote connections: between one learner and other learners, between learners and tutors; between a learning community and its learning resources\\".Goodyear, P. Banks, S. Hodgson, V. and McConnell, D. eds (2004) Advances in Research on Networked Learning. London: Kluwer Academic Publishers p1 This definition seems to ignore historical use of the term however, where computing was not of central importance. =2000s= In 2000, John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid released The Social Life of Information and introduced the concept of Networks of Practice (NoP's), an informal and emergent social network that supports the sharing of information between individuals clustered around a practice. Building on the work done by Jean Lave and √âtienne Wenger on community of practice (CoP's), Seely Brown and Duguid argued that a network differed from a community in that the relationships among members were more informal and fluid when compared to communities. While CoP's were often localized with strong inter-personal relationships providing group cohesion, NoPs were more global with relationships that were both strong tie and weak tie relationships. Salmon (2001) wrote \\"learning is built around learning communities & interaction, extending access beyond the bounds of time and space, but offering the promise of efficiency and widening access. Think of individuals as nodes on a network!\\"Salmon, G. Changing Learning Environments, Association of Learning Technology (ALT) Conference, 2001 From around 2004, the idea of networked learning had a popular resurgence, corresponding with the emergence of social media and concepts of open source, such as is covered in Yochai Benkler's 2006 book, The Wealth of Networks.A complete PDF of the book is freely downloadable on the wiki of the book and is available (see HTML version) under a Creative Commons Noncommercial Sharealike license George Siemens is a theoristSiemens, G., Connectivism: A learning theory for the digital age, International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning 2 (10), 2005. on learning in a digitally based society.

Some researchers have used networked learning methods to collaborate and support each other's research. The Wikiversity page for Doctor of Philosophy is supporting a small group interested in pursuing a PhD title informally. They name their practice OpenPhD or Open and Networked PhD. Studies =Architecture of productive learning networks= Academics at the CoCo Research Centre, University of Sydney, have been carrying out an extensive analysis of examples of networked learning, in collaboration with the developers and organisers of learning networks in various parts of the world. Their work has focussed on the architecture of learning networks - aiming to identify arrangements of tasks, tools and people that contribute to successful learning networks. Some conclusions from this work have been published in The architecture of productive learning networks, which also includes a chapter on the history of networked learning.Carvalho, L. & Goodyear, P. (Eds.) (2014) The architecture of productive learning networks, New York, Routledge. =Situated learning= Some have argued that using formal education as a setting for researching networked learning misses most if not all of the value proposition of networked learning.Illich.

Record producer Rick Rubin has described the song as, \\"A deep, reflective piece with hypnotic, interweaving riffs. Light and dark, shadow and glare. It sounds like nature coming through the speakers.\\"The Playlist Special: Fifty Artists Pick Their Personal Top 10s . Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2 January 2011. Recording and production Jimmy Page had originally intended the song to be an instrumental piece; he recorded around 14 guitar tracks to overdub the harmony section.Dave Lewis (1994), The Complete Guide to the Music of Led Zeppelin, Omnibus Press, . Robert Plant later added lyrics, which are dedicated to an old girlfriend who, ten years earlier, had made him choose either her or his music. Plant explained this in an interview in 1975: Live performances Live versions of this song were performed on Led Zeppelin's 1977 concert tour of the United States. John Paul Jones originally played the melody on an acoustic guitar before introducing a custom triple-necked instrument created by Andy Manson, that included six- string and twelve-string guitars, a mandolin, and bass pedals. Jimmy Page used his brown-painted 1953 Fender Telecaster (which a rock journalist once dubbed \\"Botswana Brown\\") outfitted with a B-Bender. The band again played the song on the first date of the concerts at Knebworth on 4 August 1979 which was also their last time playing it in concert. They cut it from their set on their second and final Knebworth appearance on 11 August, due to problems with the sound system. Page and Plant performed this song only once, during their 1996 tour (on 15 February in Osaka). Page also performed this song on his tour with the Black Crowes in 1999. In an interview he later gave to National Public Radio, Page commented on this collaboration with the Black Crowes: One version is included on Live at the Greek (2000). It peaked at number 33 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. Reception In a contemporary review of Physical Graffiti, Jim Miller of Rolling Stone described \\"Ten Years Gone\\" as having a progression reminiscent of the Beatles' \\"Dear Prudence\\" that \\"resolves in a beautifully waddling refrain.\\" Miller also believed Plant sounded like Rod Stewart on the track, with Page \\"scooping broad and fuzzy chords\\" behind him. In a retrospective review of Physical Graffiti (Deluxe Edition), Jon Hadusek of Consequence of Sound called \\"Ten Years Gone\\" one of Page/Plant's \\"most sincere compositions\\". In another retrospective review of Physical Graffiti (Deluxe Edition), Brice Ezell of PopMatters gave \\"Ten Years Gone\\" an extremely positive review, stating the track was one of Physical Graffiti's highlights along with having some of Page's \\"most enrapturing guitar work, particularly in the way he layers multiple riffs on top of each other.\\" Ezell continued, calling the song's main riff \\"lovely and echoey\\" and \\"over the course of six and a half minutes [the song] ebbs and flows, trading off sky-gazing moments of reflection with bursts of euphoria.\\" See also *List of cover versions of Led Zeppelin songs ‚Äì \\"Ten Years Gone\\" entries Footnotes References External links * 1975 songs 1970s ballads Led Zeppelin songs Hard rock ballads Song recordings produced by Jimmy Page Songs written by Jimmy Page Songs written by Robert Plant TVT Records singles ","title":"Ten Years Gone"},{"id":"2830693","text":"Samuel Friedrich Nathaniel Ritter von Stein (November 3, 1818 ‚Äì January 9, 1885) was a German entomologist. He was Professor at the Royal Saxon Academy of Forestry in Tharandt from 1850‚Äì55; and Professor, and later Rector, at the Charles University in Prague, from 1855‚Äì76. His scientific work focused on invertebrates, and mainly on Diptera.  Early life, education, and family  Stein was born in Niemegk, near Potsdam, Brandenburg. He completed his studies in 1841, conducting doctoral work at the University of Berlin. On May 29, 1844, in Berlin, he married Emma Johanne Couard Ottilie (born December 30, 1823, in Berlin; died 2 September 1903, in Asch). The couple had nine children. The next to last, daughter Adelheid von Stein (born May 25, 1859), married Joseph Neuwirth.  Career  Stein's scientific work focused on invertebrates, and mainly on Diptera, as well as single-celled animals. His work on infusoria became the basis for all subsequent research in this area.Assessment of the Dresden University of Technology. See: (in German). Stein was appointed as Curator of the Zoological Museum at the University of Berlin, in 1849. From 1850 to 1855, he was professor of zoology and botany at the Academy of Forestry in Tharandt, Saxony, 20 km south-west of Dresden. Tharandt had one of the leading forestry schools in Germany. Formal education in forestry began about 1840 when private forestry schools were established. These were the outgrowth of the old master schools. The forestry college at Tharandt developed from Cotta Master School. Though not of the same order, Tharandt had close connections with the French National School of Forestry, which had been established in Nancy, France, in 1825. The work at Tharandt, under Stein's supervision was of a very high order, thoroughly professional and of very high technical standards. In 1855, he became professor at the Charles University in Prague, where he worked until retirement. He served as Rector of the university in the 1875‚Äì76 academic year.  Honors  Stein was ennobled on April 27, 1878, in Vienna by Emperor Franz Josef I.

He was the only shooter to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals in the 300 m rifle event before it was discontinued. He also set six individual world records, and won seven world and 11 national titles, as well as 11 gold medals at the Pan-American Games. Early life and education Born in Holdrege, Nebraska, Anderson grew up on a farm near Axtell, Nebraska, and graduated from Axtell High School in 1957. He attended the University of Nebraska for one year and then enlisted in the army. He served in the army until 1962, attaining the rank of Lieutenant. After resigning from the army, Anderson served with the Nebraska Army National Guard from 1963 to 1965 and the California National Guard from 1965 to 1968. During this time he received degrees from Hastings College in Nebraska and the San Francisco Theological Seminary in California. Political career Anderson was elected as a Republican to a four-year term in the Nebraska Legislature in 1972. During his term, Anderson felt that the Republican Party was too engaged in partisan politics, so he changed affiliation from the Republican to the Democratic Party. At the end of his term, Anderson did not seek re-election. Sport shooting career From a very young age, hunting and shooting fascinated Anderson. Without benefit of a coach or proper equipment (including ammunition), he taught himself how to shoot by dry-firing his rifle for hours at a time. Dreams of becoming an Olympic gold medalist in shooting led Anderson to the United States Army. In 1959, after convincing skeptical army coaches that his implausibly high shooting scores were accurate, he was assigned to the elite United States Army Marksmanship Unit at Fort Benning, Georgia. His first international competition was the Pan American Games in 1959‚Äîonly two years later, in 1961, he would win his first national championship. At the 1962 World Shooting Championships in Cairo, Egypt, he stunned the shooting world, then completely dominated by Russian shooters, by winning four individual titles and setting three new world records. At the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Anderson confirmed his performance in Cairo was not a fluke, setting a new world record and winning the 300 meter free-rifle gold medal. At the 1966 World Shooting Championships in Wiesbaden, Germany, he won three additional titles. Anderson continued to demonstrate his dedication to shooting by besting his own world record and winning a second gold medal in the 300 meter free-rifle event at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Anderson retired from active international competition after the 1969 World Championships in Barcelona, Spain, where his 50-meter, three-position score of 1182 was the highest score ever fired in international competition. In ten years, his two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship gold medals, six world records, and 12 national titles were and continue to be the most major international shooting titles ever won by an American. Following retirement from active competition, he continued to devote his time and energy to shooting sports by coaching young shooters, teaching shooting clinics, speaking at numerous shooting sports functions, and authoring hundreds of magazine articles and three books about shooting. Even during his \\"retirement\\" from shooting competition, Anderson competed in the National Rifle Association National Highpower Championships at Camp Perry, Ohio, winning the President's National Trophy in 1973, 1975 and 1976. Anderson worked at the National Rifle Association (NRA) where he served as Executive Director of General Operations. He was responsible for the development of safety, training and competition programs. Among hundreds of other honors, Anderson was awarded the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice (NBPRP) Distinguished International Shooting Badge (Serial number one) in April 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. While at the NRA, he served on the NBPRP board, and was one of the first people to advocate and pioneer a shift in priorities to youth and junior shooting. As a result of this shift, Anderson became the founding and administrative director of the U.S. Shooting Team Foundation and, in 1993, he moved to Atlanta to become the Shooting Competitions Manager for the 1996 Olympic Games. In 1996, Anderson accepted a position with Fulton County, Georgia, to manage the Wolf Creek Shooting Venue, a facility destined to become a premier national and international center for the shooting sports. Anderson's influence on shooting sports extends well beyond the United States. He traveled extensively throughout his career in shooting, serving as a genuine ambassador for shooting sports, attending eleven Summer Olympic Games, three as a competitor and eight as technical delegate or a jury member. He is the first American ever elected to the position of Vice President of the International Shooting Union, and still serves in that capacity today. Anderson is also the recipient of one of only five prestigious honorary memberships to the historic and renowned shooting club, Hauptschutzengesellschaft, in Munich, Germany. After his active career, Anderson has continued to work with shooting. He was Shooting Competition Manager at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and served as Director of Civilian Marksmanship in the U.S. Civilian Marksmanship Program from 1999 to 2009 (now Director Emeritus). He is also one of the vice presidents of the International Shooting Sport Federation.Gary Anderson Director Civilian Marksmanship Emeritus. thecmp.org In June 2012, the International Olympic Committee awarded Anderson the IOC's highest honor, the Olympic Order for outstanding services to the Olympic Movement.President & 2-Time Olympic Gold Medalist Gary Anderson Receives IOC‚Äôs Olympic Order. usashooting.org (November 16, 2012) References Sources * Gary Lee Anderson papers at the Nebraska State Historical Society 1939 births Living people People from Holdrege, Nebraska Sportspeople from Nebraska American male sport shooters United States Army officers United States Distinguished Marksman ISSF rifle shooters Olympic shooters of the United States Shooters at the 1964 Summer Olympics Shooters at the 1968 Summer Olympics Olympic gold medalists for the United States in shooting Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Medalists at the 1968 Summer Olympics Hastings College alumni University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln alumni San Francisco Theological Seminary alumni Nebraska state senators Nebraska Republicans Olympic medalists in shooting Nebraska Democrats Pan American Games medalists in shooting Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Shooters at the 1959 Pan American Games Shooters at the 1963 Pan American Games Shooters at the 1967 Pan American Games ","title":"Gary Anderson (sport shooter)"},{"id":"2830703","text":"Dick Marty, 2007 Dick Marty (born 7 January 1945) is a Swiss politician (FDP.The Liberals) and former state prosecutor of the canton of Ticino. He is a former member of the Swiss Council of States (from 1995 to 2011) and of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Early life Marty was born in Sorengo. He holds a doctorate in law from the University of Neuch√¢tel. His thesis was entitled, The Role and the Power of the Swiss Judge in the Application of Penal Sanctions (). Professional career =Max Planck Institute= From 1972 to 1975, Marty worked at the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law in Freiburg, Germany, responsible for the section on Swiss law. =State prosecutor= In 1975, Marty was nominated state prosecutor of Ticino, in which post he was specially noted for his energetic activities fighting organized crime and drug abuse. For his achievements in the area of drug legislation, he received in 1987 an Award of Honor of the United States Department of Justice and a special award of honor by the International Narcotic Enforcement Officers Association. In 1989 he was elected a member of the cantonal executive in Ticino, where he was director of the finance department, and in 1992 additionally held the office of president, which rotates among the members. In 1995, upon being elected to the Swiss Council of States for Ticino, he resigned from his executive post and has since worked part-time as a legal and economic consultant. In the Council of States he has been member of key commissions, including the Finance Commission and Economy and Taxes Commission, and took an active part in getting the new Swiss constitution through parliament. =Council of Europe= In 1998 Marty was appointed as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, where he became a member of its Monitoring Committee. He was later second vice-chairman of the Political Affairs Committee, with further positions in sub-committees.  CIA secret prisons in Europe  In 2005, Marty was appointed to lead an investigation by the Council of Europe into alleged unlawful CIA prisons in Europe. Marty was planning to use satellite images and aviation logs, among many other sources of information, to find out whether the \\"rendition\\" of terror suspects for possible torture, or for secret detention, had taken place in any of the Council of Europe's 47 member states. These activities could be a violation of European human rights standards. In June 2006 Marty released his report on behalf of the Parliamentary Assembly, concluding that evidence showed that fourteen European states had assisted in the perpetration of such abuses.Geoff Meade (Wednesday 7 June 2006) \\"Britain Named for Colluding in US Rendition Flights\\" , originally published by The IndependentDick Marty (12 June 2006) \\"Alleged secret detentions and unlawful inter-state transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states\\" , Council of Europe Marty published the second part of this work on 8 June 2007, named Secret Detentions and Illegal Transfers of Detainees Involving Council of Europe Member States: Second Report.Dick Marty, (8 June 2007), Secret detentions and illegal transfers of detainees involving Council of Europe member states: second report, Council of Europe  Organ theft in Kosovo  On 14 December 2010, Marty published a report for adoption by the Council of Europe alleging inhuman treatment of people and killing of prisoners with the purpose of removal and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo, involving Hashim Tha√ßi, the Kosovo prime minister and former Kosovo Liberation Army political leader.Inhuman treatment of people and illicit trafficking in human organs in Kosovo, Council of Europe Kosovo's leading politicians reacted strongly to Marty's report. Kosovo's acting president, Jakup Krasniqi, called the report \\"racist towards Albanians\\". Prime Minister Tha√ßi accused Marty of being \\"an opponent of Kosovo's independence\\" and called the report \\"politically motivated\\", \\"not based on facts\\", with the \\"goal to damage the newly-created state of Kosovo, Kosovo‚Äôs image, to question the election process, creation of institutions and Kosovo‚Äôs European future\\".\\"Interview with Thaci in Kosovar daily 'Gazeta Express'\\" , Gazeta Express As reported by several international,Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in West Balkan languages: \\"Taƒçi ƒáe objaviti spisak Albanaca koji su pomagali Martiju\\" (Thaci will publish the list of Albanians who were helping Marty) Serbian,B92 in English: \\"Thaci to release names of Marty‚Äôs helpers\\" KosovanKosova Info: \\"Tha√ßi ka dosje t√´ bashk√´pun√´tor√´ve t√´ Martyt\\" (Thaci has record of Marty's collaborators) and AlbanianInfo Albania: Thaci ka dosje te bashkepunetoreve te Martyt (Thaci has record of Marty's collaborators) news agencies, in an interview for Albanian TV Klan on 24 December 2010, Tha√ßi threatened to publish a list of Albanians who collaborated in providing information to Dick Marty for this report.

Retrieved 2 February 2011  Euthanasia  Marty acted as Special Rapporteur for the Assembly's Social, Health and Family Affairs Committee on the topic of euthanasia. His report and draft resolution, published in September 2003, called on Council of Europe members to collect empirical data on assisted dying, to promote debate and analysis of the evidence, and to consider whether legislation should be brought forward to exempt doctors from prosecution for assisting suicide under certain strict conditions. His stance proved controversial and the report was criticised by a number of organisations, such as the World Federation of Catholic Medical Associations and the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics. John Keown, a professor of Christian ethics at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, described it as \\"Mr Marty's muddle\\" and criticized him for \\"superficiality\\" and \\"selectivity.\\" The Committee subsequently adopted a formal Opinion prepared by the British member Kevin McNamara, which criticised several of Marty's findings and conclusions and sought to replace the call for governments to consider legislation to legalise assisted dying with a resolution to \\"report back to the Parliamentary Assembly for further consideration\\". McNamara's amendments were criticised in turn by organisations such as the World Federation of Right to Die Societies. Keown's criticism of Marty's report was criticised by Guy Widdershoven of Maastricht University. Marty's report, as amended, was rejected by 138 votes to 26. =Ballot Initiative for Global Corporate Responsibility = Since 2015, Marty serves as co-president for the ballot measure to amend the Swiss constitution so that global companies headquartered in Switzerland are adhering to human rights and environmental standards. In February 2019, the ballot measure initially passed the Swiss National Council and was modified by the Council of States, rejecting the counter-initiative by the National Council.

JavaServer Pages Access Model. October 7, 1998 A simplified diagram of a Model 1 implementation. In Model 1, a request is made to a JSP or servlet and then that JSP or servlet handles all responsibilities for the request, including processing the request, validating data, handling the business logic, and generating a response. The Model 1 architecture is commonly used in smaller, simple task applications due to its ease of development. Although conceptually simple, this architecture is not conducive to large-scale application development because, inevitably, a great deal of functionality is duplicated in each JSP. Also, the Model 1 architecture unnecessarily ties together the business logic and presentation logic of the application. Combining business logic with presentation logic makes it hard to introduce a new 'view' or access point in an application. For example, in addition to an HTML interface, you might want to include a Wireless Markup Language (WML) interface for wireless access. In this case, using Model 1 will unnecessarily require the duplication of the business logic with each instance of the presentation code.

It can be used with the Expressive Vocabulary Test-Second Edition (EVT-2) to make a direct comparison between the examinee‚Äôs receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. The PPVT was developed in 1959 by special education specialists Lloyd M. Dunn and Leota M. Dunn. The current version lists L.M. Dunn and his son D.M. Dunn as authors. Procedure The test is given verbally and takes from twenty to thirty minutes to complete. No reading is required by the individual, and scoring is rapid. For its administration, the examiner presents a series of pictures to each person. There are four pictures to a page, and each is numbered. The examiner speaks a word describing one of the pictures and asks the individual to point to or say the number of the picture that the word describes. Item responses can also be made by multiple choice selection depending on the age of the person being tested. The total score can be converted to a percentile rank, mental age, or a standard deviation IQ score. Although desirable, no special training is required to properly administer and score the PPVT-IV. The test publisher recommends that anyone interpreting or explaining the test scores should have knowledge in psychological testing and statistics. Changes from previous edition The national norms of the PPVT-III were extended to include ages 2:6 through 90+ years of age. The PPVT-IV was developed from adult norms obtained on 828 persons ages 19 to 40 selected to be nationally representative of geographical regions and major occupational groups. No people with handicaps were included in the norm population. Two parallel forms (A and B) can be used for testing and retesting. Clinical use The PPVT-IV provides an estimate of the client's verbal intelligence and has been administered to groups who had reading or speech problems, had intellectual disability, or were emotionally withdrawn. Studies of earlier versions of the test suggested that it tended to underestimate full-scale IQ scores for both intellectually disabled and gifted test-takers. Because the manner of the individual's response to stimulus vocabulary is to point in any fashion to one of four pictures that best fits the stimulus work, these tests also apply to rehabilitation of individuals who have multiple physical impairments, but whose hearing and vision are intact. The PPVT-IV can also be used for assessing the English vocabulary of non-English-speaking individuals and assessing adult verbal ability. PPVT clinical research publications include thousands of references. To organize PPVT publications into groupings, two different types of database searches for PPVT publications were completed. The first search quarried the American Psychological Association PsycNET. The second search quarried the American Psychological Association PsycINFO. =E-assessments research= Due to known validity and reliability coefficients of the PPVT since the early 1970s, the PPVT provided an instrument against which questions related to mechanized testing systems could be studied. Mechanized testing systems were testing systems which integrated equipment such as slide projectors and tape players to administer the PPVT could be studied. One mechanized testing system employed a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-12 computer, interfaced with a Universal Digital Controller to control the random access audio system and the slide projector. The PDP-12 was equipped with a Teletype Model 33 and was interfaced with an oscilloscope so that, during PPVT testing, the status readout of the item number and correctness of response of the last item completed to administer the PPVT could be determined.Elwood, David L. and Clark, Carolyn L. (1978). \\"[Computer administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test to young children. Behavior Research Methods & Instrumentation, Vol. 10(1), pp. 43-46]\\" An e-assessment project published in the mid-1980s included an examination of both test validity and test reliability of a personal computer administration (Apple II) in contrast to a paper and pencil administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R). During the computer administration the students' only interaction with an adult occurred when the students were walked from their classroom to the school library where each was led to a table with the Apple II computer. Each student was informed that the computer would administer the directions. In addition the students were informed that if they would like the directions or word repeated, they should press the space bar on the computer keyboard. The PPVT-R software program verbally administered the test instructions and administered the visual sample test items. After each student met the standard for administering the PPVT-R, the software program followed the PPVT-R standard test instructions, verbally administered the stimulus word while displaying the visual choices. The software administration included offering, when appropriate, verbal praise to the child for correct responses and informing each student when the test was completed.Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (1987). \\"An Investigation of the validity, reliability, and acceptance by children of a microcomputer administration of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) ,\\" As computer-human technology improves, future PPVT e-assessments research may include use of visual tracking computer interface such as wearable eye tracking glasses \\"Eye tracking gives Rett Syndrome patients a voice,\\"Davis, John (2011). \\"Eye- Tracking Devices Help Disabled Use Computers,\\" so that disabled adults can respond to PPVT test items by scanning the visual field and fixing their eye gaze on the visual item they select. Future PPVT e-assessment research could integrate the human nervous system with e-administration of the PPVT. The human nervous system e-assessment would involve assessment of the P300 (P3) wave event related potential (ERP) between visual picture test items and the picture word comparing and contrasting the correct pairing of the word and picture against incorrect pairing of words and pictures. Use of the PPVT with cognitive disabled individuals and their response to the P3 ERP waveform could be used as a measure for the efficacy of various treatments on cognitive function. Limits The test is not useful in its present form for blind and deaf people, but can be useful for people with intellectual disability without modification of the test administration procedure. A possible problem with the test for adults is that the illustrations for about the first fifty items typically feature children, and thus may not be appropriate for adult subjects with intellectual disability.

The development of a popular thermal swimming pool at the Cave and Basin eventually led to pollution of the dace's habitat. Deliberate introduction of mosquitofish in the 1920s was followed by various tropical fish (and aquarium plants) which reproduce year-round in the marsh, while the Banff longnose dace only spawned once a year. The exotic fish also out-competed the dace for food and preyed on unhatched eggs. The few remaining Banff longnose dace hybridized with the Eastern longnose dace from the nearby Bow River. In 1981 a research study showed that the habitat destruction and the introduction of the non-native fish threatened the dace. It is hypothesized that this Banff subspecies' unique genetic structure was irreversibly mixed with another subspecies (termed introgressive hybridization), and by 1986 it had disappeared and was declared extinct in April 1987 by COSEWIC. Currently a study is underway to clarify the taxonomic classification of this putative subspecies.

It is a complex of two buildings and a clock tower joined together by a common corridor; the oldest part of the building was first built in 1862, and the complex was completed in 1909. The complex has undergone a number of renovations and refurbishment, mostly recently in 2010 when the complex was closed for a four- year renovation project. It reopened on 15 July 2014.NAC Arts Venues . www.nac.gov.sg. Retrieved on 4 July 2013. The buildings in the complex have been used for a number of purposes, such as public events, political meetings, exhibitions, musical and stage performances, and for a brief period as a hospital. The concert hall is used as a performance venue by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), and the complex is managed by The Esplanade Co Ltd. The Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall was gazetted as a national monument on 14 February 1992. History Town Hall, Singapore - ca. 1880 The Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall first began as the Town Hall in 1862. In the early 1900s a second public hall was built next to it joined by a clock tower to form a larger complex. = Town Hall origin = The Town Hall was originally built to replace the older Assembly Rooms, where local operas and dramas were held but had fallen into disrepair. The foundation stone was laid in 1855, and the building completed in 1862. The building was designed by the Municipal Engineer, John Bennett. It was built during an era of Victorian Revivalism that was then popular in Britain, and its design therefore reflected this architectural style with Italianate windows, and it was the first such building in Singapore built in this style. The completed town hall originally housed a theatre on the ground floor as well as meeting rooms and offices of various government agencies on the second floor. It also housed the Singapore Library from 1862 to 1876. However, the increase in population resulted in higher demand for entertainment, and the town hall was unable to cope with increasing demand for the use of the building for both entertainment and as administrative purposes, thus by 1893, the offices was moved out of the building. = Construction of Victoria Concert Hall= Victoria Theatre and Victoria Memorial Hall, 1930s In 1901, it was decided that a public hall would be built in memory of Queen Victoria who died that year. Public funds for its construction amounting to $368,000 were collected, exceeding the construction costs, thus leaving a surplus of $22,000 for the renovation of the town hall so that it blended in with the new hall. The foundation stone was laid on the occasion of King Edward VII's coronation celebration on 10 August 1902, and the new building was built between 1903 and 1905 next to the Town Hall. The plan of the memorial hall was initially drawn up by Major Alexander Murray and the Public Works Department, which included the reconstruction of the front elevation of the old town hall on similar lines to the facade of the new memorial hall, which was later on modified by R. A. J. Bidwell of Swan and Maclaren. The new layout of the hall consisted of a stage, stalls and pit on the ground floor and dress circle, promenade and a gallery on top of the foyer. = Construction of Clock Tower and renovation of Town Hall= The two buildings, the town hall and the Victoria Memorial Hall, were joined together by a clock tower built in 1906 to give the impression of a single building. The 54 metre-high tower connects the two buildings with a common corridor, and is topped by a timepiece donated by the Straits Trading Company. The tower is built on an axial line with the Anderson Bridge nearby. Renovation of the Town Hall began in July 1906. A portico was created on the town hall mirroring that of the new Memorial Hall, thereby creating a unified appearance. The construction of the signature clock tower was delayed due to delays in the donation of the clock and chimes by the Straits Trading Company. The clock, four metres wide, weighs 1 tonne and cost $6,000. Its dial faces look in four directions, and there is a bell turret above it, capped by a cupola. =Opening= Statue of Stamford Raffles in front of the clock tower The Victoria Memorial Hall was officially opened by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir John Anderson, on 18 October 1905. The renovated Town Hall was reopened on 11 February 1909. The Pirates of Penzance was the first performance to be staged in the renovated building when it reopened. The town hall was renamed Victoria Theatre. On 6 February 1919, the centenary of Singapore's founding, a statue of Stamford Raffles by T. Woolner was moved from the Padang to the front of the Memorial Hall. The statue was complemented with a new semicircular colonnade and a pool. =Historical events and uses= In World War II, the memorial hall was used as a hospital for victims of bombing raids by Japanese forces during the Battle of Singapore before their successful occupation of the colony. During the occupation, the buildings themselves escaped major physical damage, although the colonnade was destroyed and Raffles's statue moved to the National Museum. The statue was returned to its original site in 1946. In 1947 The Straits Settlements coat of arms that was hung on the tympanum of both wings of the building was replaced by the newly formed coat of arms of the Crown Colony of Singapore. It was brought down in 1959 to make a plaster cast of the Coat of Arms of Singapore, which was topped off with two flagpoles with the Flag of Singapore on them. A number of significant civic as well as historical events were held on the premises. The Memorial Hall was the venue for Japanese war crimes trials from 1946 to 1947. From 1948 onward, the Hall was used during elections as the centre for the briefing of election officials and the counting of ballot papers. On 21 November 1954, it was the venue of the People's Action Party's founding. Two public meetings of the Rendel Commission were held 1953 and 1955 in the hall to review the Constitution of the Colony of Singapore in preparation for its independence. On 15 February 1963, Singapore's pilot television broadcasting service, Television Singapura, was launched here. Interior of Victoria Concert Hall in 2006, before the latest refurbishment The town hall underwent major renovation between 1952 and 1958, and it was also internally restructured to allow air-conditioning and soundproofing to be installed. Singapore‚Äôs national song, ‚ÄúMajulah Singapura ‚Äú , was performed for the first time at Victoria Theatre in 1958 after the major renovations. In 1979, the Memorial Hall was renovated again to accommodate the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO), at which time it was renamed the Victoria Concert Hall. Additional works up to the 1980s added a gallery to the Concert Hall, increasing seating capacity and enclosing the second storey balconies on the front and back facades with glass. = Refurbishment (2010‚Äì2014) = The refurbished interior of Victoria Concert Hall, 2014 In June 2010, Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall were closed for major renovations. The S$180-million refurbishment was undertaken by W Architects, and Rider Levett Bucknall (RLB) Singapore as the project manager and quantity surveyor, with Architectural Restoration Consultants Pte Ltd (ARC) as its conservator and Arup Singapore Pte Ltd as acoustician and theatre planner. The refurbishment repaired and updated the buildings to meet contemporary standards. The fa√ßade of the buildings is retained, and some elements belonging to the original 1905 structure restored. This includes reinstating the central passageway between the theatre and the concert hall, which leads to the Arts House. New spaces were created to accommodate building services and for commercial rental and amenities like a caf√©. While the significant interior features of the concert hall were retained, most of the theatre (save the fa√ßade) was completely demolished during the renovations. Refurbished interior of Victoria Theatre The building now has extra new spaces for the public, performers and support crew. The theatre has new changing rooms and a loading bay, while the central atrium has been opened up and has become an additional area for hosting arts activities. The roof level of the theatre was raised to match that of the concert hall, and the extra space under the roof houses a new dance studio. But having new spaces means some sacrifices were necessary. For instance, the theatre now seats fewer people ‚Äì about 600 from some 900 before ‚Äì to free up space in what is now the atrium. The concert hall's balcony was also made smaller and higher, so that acoustics are not compromised for those sitting below.  Facilities (1990s‚Äì2010s)  Foyer of Victoria Theatre The Victoria Theatre had a seating capacity of 904, reduced to 614 after its refurbishment. The Victoria Concert Hall also had a higher capacity of 883 seats originally, but is now reduced to 673, as an unsightly and intrusive balcony inserted during an earlier renovation was removed. Prior to its refurbishment, the theatre had a stage of 167.28 square metres in size, and the concert hall a stage that could be expanded up to 139.76 square metres. The concert hall was considered the venue with the best acoustics in the city, and was the main performance venue for the SSO until the completion of the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay in 2002 when the orchestra moved its home base to take advantage of superior acoustics and facilities brought about by technological and architectural advances over the years.

His record score of 559 would still be competitive today in this event. He also won the World Championships in Free Pistol in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1947 and 1952. Ullman was not a free pistol specialist but rather an all-round shooter, achieving great successes in all three pistol events that existed at the time. In the Rapid Fire competition in Berlin, he won the bronze medal after an extremely rapid shoot-off, and three years later he became World Champion in that event, being one of only four shooters to win major worldwide titles in both 50 m Pistol and 25 m Rapid Fire Pistol. He entered the first World Championship in 25 m Center-Fire Pistol in 1947, surprisingly with a Smith & Wesson revolver, and won by seven points, causing a worldwide revolver hype. He repeated this victory in 1954. Ullman was one of the first sport shooters to take practice and preparation to a scientific level, which he himself always claimed was a main reason for his success. In 1937, he received the Svenska Dagbladet gold medal for the greatest Swedish sports achievement of the year. He is the only pistol shooter to have received this prestigious award. Besides his shooting career, Ullman worked with pistol development, and co-authored a widely spread book on shooting with Lev Weinstein. He also started a mechanical industry on Helg√∂ outside V√§xj√∂, Sm√•land. It was later moved to Moheda and developed a few filials. Today this industry has been purchased by Finnveden AB. Ullman was educated from 1925 to 1927 at Sherborne School in Dorset, UK. On leaving Sherborne School he attended Clare College, Cambridge University and then Uppsala University in Sweden.

In academic settings around the world, community studies is variously a sub-discipline of anthropology or sociology, or an independent discipline. It is often interdisciplinary and geared toward practical applications rather than purely theoretical perspectives.The University of California at Santa Cruz has an interdisciplinary Community Studies Department Community studies is sometimes combined with other fields, i.e., \\"Urban and Community Studies,\\" \\"Health and Community Studies,\\" or \\"Family and Community studies.\\"Examples of Community Studies programs with a particular focus: Urban and Community Studies at the University of Toronto; The Institute of Health and Community Studies at Bournemouth University, UK, and The Faculty of Child, Family and Community Studies at Douglas College, New Westminster BC, Canada.  Epistemology  In North America, community studies drew inspiration from the classic urban sociology texts produced by the Chicago School, such as the works of Louis Wirth and William Foote Whyte. In Britain, community studies was developed for colonial administrators working in East Africa, particularly Kenya. It was further developed in the post-war period with the Institute of Community Studies founded by Michael Young in east London, and with the studies published from the Institute, such as Family and Kinship in East London. Community studies, like colonial anthropology, have often assumed the existence of discrete, relatively homogeneous, almost tribe-like communities, which can be studied as organic wholes. In this, it has been a key influence on communitarianism and communalism, from the local context to the global and everywhere in between.  Curricula  Community studies curricula are often centered on the \\"concerns\\" of communities. These include mental and physical health, stress, addiction, AIDS, racism, immigration, ethnicity, gender, identity, sexuality, the environment, crime, deviance, delinquency, family problems, social competence, poverty, homelessness and other psycho-social aspects. Understanding the socio-cultural completeness and the anthropological ramifications of the accurate analysis of community health is key to the sphere of these studies.Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, Aims and Scope Another focus of curricula in community studies is upon anthropology, cultural anthropology in particular. Some programs set as prerequisite knowledge, the background and historical contexts for community, drawing upon archeological findings and the theoretical underpinnings for social organization in ancient and prehistorical community settings. The theories connected with the so-called \\"Neolithic revolution\\" is one example of a deep study into how, where and why, hunter- gatherer communities formed.Bellwood, Peter. (2004). First Farmers: The Origins of Agricultural Societies. Blackwell Publishers. Community studies have been linked to the causes of social justice, promoting peace and nonviolence and working towards social change, often within an activist framework.See, for example: Community Studies 2005 , U.C.

Biography Born in Belfast on Marchioness Street,Volunteer Seamus Twomey, 1919-1989 : a tribute. Twomey lived at 6 Sevastopol Street in the Falls district. Known as \\"Thumper\\" owing to his short temper and habit of banging his fist on tables, he received little education and was a bookmaker's (bookie's) 'runner'. Seamus's father was a volunteer in the 1920s. In Belfast he lived comfortably with his wife, Rosie, whom he married in 1946. Together they had sons and daughters.  IRA  He began his involvement with the Irish Republican Army in the 1930s and was interned in Northern Ireland during the 1940s on the prison ship Al Rawdah and later in Crumlin Road Jail in Belfast. Rosie, his wife, was also held prisoner at the women prison, Armagh Jail, in Northern Ireland. He opposed the left-wing shift of Cathal Goulding in the 1960s, and in 1968, helped set up the breakaway Andersonstown Republican Club (later the Roddy McCorley Society). In 1969, he was prominent in the establishment of the Provisional IRA. By 1972, he was Officer Commanding of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade when it launched its bomb campaign of the city, including Bloody Friday when nine people were killed. During the 1970s, the leadership of the Belfast Brigade of the IRA was largely in the hands of Twomey and Ivor Bell. In March 1973, Twomey was first appointed IRA Chief of Staff after the arrest of Joe Cahill. He remained in this position until his arrest in October 1973 by the Garda S√≠och√°na. Three weeks later, on 31 October 1973, the IRA organised the helicopter escape of Twomey and his fellow IRA members J.B. O'Hagan and Kevin Mallon, when an active service unit hijacked and forced the pilot at gun-point to land the helicopter in the training yard of Mountjoy Prison. After his escape, he returned to his membership of IRA's Army Council. By June/July 1974, Twomey was IRA Chief of Staff for a second time. He took part in the Feakle talks between the IRA and Protestant clergymen in December 1974. In the IRA truce which followed in 1975, Twomey was largely unsupportive and wanted to fight on in what he saw as \\"one big push to finish it once and for all\\".John McGuffin, Internment, 1973 (Chapter 16: Internment out‚ÄìDetention in) IRA informer Sean O'Callaghan claims that on 5 January 1976, Twomey and Brian Keenan gave the go-ahead for the sectarian Kingsmill massacre, when 10 unarmed Ulster Protestant workmen were executed by the Provisional IRA in retaliation for a rash of loyalist killings of Catholics in the area. It was Keenan's view, O'Callaghan claims, that \\"The only way to knock the nonsense out of the Prods is to be 10 times more savage\\".Sean O'Callaghan, \\"The Decider\\", Irish Independent, 12 February 2000. Twomey was dedicated to paramilitarism as a means of incorporating Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland. In an interview with French television on 11 July 1977, he declared that although the IRA had waged a campaign for seven years at that point, it could fight on for another 70 against the British state in Northern Ireland and in England.Quoted in Kevin. J. Kelley, The Longest War: Northern Ireland and the IRA, Westport, Conn: Zed Books, 1988. Twomey supported the bombing of wealthy civilian targets, which he justified on class lines. On 29 October 1977, for example, a no-warning bomb at an Italian restaurant in Mayfair killed one diner and wounded 17 others. Three more people were killed in similar blasts in Chelsea and Mayfair the following month. Twomey said: \\"By hitting Mayfair restaurants, we were hitting the type of person that could bring pressure to bear on the British government\\".  Capture  In December 1977, he was captured in Sandycove, Dublin by the Garda S√≠och√°na, who had been tipped off by Belgian police about a concealed arms shipment, to be delivered to a bogus company with an address in the area. They swooped on a house in Martello Terrace to discover Twomey outside in his car, wearing his trademark dark glasses. After a high-speed pursuit, he was recaptured in the centre of Dublin. The Garda√≠ later found documents in his possession outlining proposals for the structural reorganisation of the IRA according to the cell system. Twomey's arrest ended his tenure as IRA chief of staff. In the 1986 split over abstentionism, Twomey sided with the Gerry Adams leadership and remained with the Provisionals.

It was also known by its users as CNet. It ran from 1984 to May 1993. Overview Compunet hosted a wide range of content, and users were permitted to create their own sections within which they could upload their own graphics, articles and software. A custom editor existed in which the \\"frames\\" that made up the pages could be created either offline or when connected to the service. The editor's cache allowed users to quickly download a set of pages, then disconnect from the service in order to read them, thus saving on telephone costs. The user interface used a horizontally scrolling menu system, known as the \\"duck shoot\\", and navigation was essentially \\"select and click\\" with the ability to jump directly to pages with the use of keywords. Content could be voted upon by the users. The service had many features which were considerably ahead of its time, especially when compared to the Internet of today: * Pricing of content (Optional. Users could price their own content). * Voting on content quality. * \\"Upload anywhere\\" of content: programs, graphics and text (Unless a section was protected). * Software could be dongle protected (the custom modem doubled as the dongle in this instance). * WYSIWYG editing of content. * Chat room (known as Partyline), which allowed users to create their own rooms (similar principles have been shown in IRC). The server hosted Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) (by Richard Bartle), Federation II, and Realm. The first two of these games continue to run on the Internet today. Games creator Jeff Minter and musician Rob Hubbard, along with various members of the demo scene, had a presence on the network. History In 1982, Commodore UK decided to construct a nationwide computer network for the use of teachers. The Commodore PET computer had been very successful. Nick Green developed the specification of what became PETNET with David Parkinson and Mike Bolley of Ariadne Software in The Albany pub (see \\"PETNET - data transmission system\\" in \\"Microcomputers in education\\" ed Dr I.C.H. Smith 1982 John Wiley ). In the Summer of 1982 Keith Hall of Commodore secured the money to commission the prototype which was run on an ADP DEC-10 machine. Ariadne Software wrote the software in 6502 Assembler for the client and FORTRAN for the host. The X25 packet protocol was modified to provide error correction for all file transfers. At ADP's suggestion reliable uploading was achieved by using temporary file names which were changed to user file names when the last byte had been correctly received by the host. Nick Green sought partners who could provide local call access and Host facilities. Alan Carmichael, Graham Craigie and Robert Foot of ADP joined the project. Around this time the BBC Micro was released and gained enormous popularity within the UK education system. Commodore's 64 was seen as the \\"more bangs per buck\\" American alternative. PETNET became Compunet which was aimed to support consumer and educational users. Nick Green specified a secure modem based on the Viewdata chip set and the assembly language client software was ported into the modem and bundled with the Commodore 1541 disk drive. After the first year Commodore was bought out and Compunet Teleservices Ltd became an independent company. Compunet culture was covered in the first issue of Commodore Disk User, which shipped software on its cover disk. ADP provided the initial DEC-10 mainframe, as well as the local-access dial-up points. But this was very expensive and a scheduled migration to a VME bus based multi-micro machine was successfully undertaken. New local dial-up points were provided by ISTEL (on their Fastrak network). After a management buy out ISTEL was sold to AT&T.; This led to the failure of ISTEL technical support and an upgrade of local access to 2400/2400 baud. The best efforts of Ariadne and Compunet staffers Jason Gold and Mark Clarke came to nothing as the English legal system failed to protect Compunet's contracts. This meant a higher cost nationwide rate call for most users. A third move of the Compunet Host to Camden in North London was undertaken with Nick Green now board chair and MD. By this time client software was ported to the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST and a teletype compatible version of the service using BBS scrolling text was introduced aimed at integration with the Internet and PCs. Compunet ceased trading in May 1993, when the company went into receivership for non- payment of VAT after the sudden short illness and death of Jim Chalmers, their sole practitioner accountant. He was negotiating a VAT refund at the time. Immediate barrister intervention failed despite ¬£250,000 of debt asset. Subscription model Compunet charged a quarterly subscription, and telephone call costs were in addition to this. Typical off-peak charges would be ¬£0.80UKP per hour. Premium services incurred additional charges, which required the user to first place money in their account. These services included: * Private e-mail (some free quota was provided). * Uploading content. * Custom banners. * Customised user name (instead of, for example, 'abc3'). * Access to chat and gaming services. Technology =Client= For the Commodore 64, Compunet provided a custom 1200/75 baud modem (affectionately known as the \\"brick\\") which utilised the machine's cartridge port. As well as the usual modem features, the device had a custom ROM which contained the rudiments of the software required to access the service. This software could be updated automatically upon connection to the service. Out of the box, the modem was unable to connect to standard Bulletin board systems unless an optional software package was purchased. The modem was programmed with a unique ID. This allowed it to work as a dongle to help prevent copyright infringement of protected software. The custom nature of the technology hindered Compunet to a degree. The graphical design was very much keyed into the Commodore 64's graphical capabilities. Although this was more powerful than the Viewdata systems such as Prestel, it meant porting was difficult. However, software was later made available for the Amiga (1987) and Atari ST (1988). A PC version was developed in-house but never made publicly available. The Amiga and Atari ST versions both emulated the graphics and interface of the original Commodore 64. However, the PC version was teletype in nature, utilising Kermit for file transfers. =Server= The host server was a DEC-10 at launch, which ran Compunet as a time-slice. ADP provided the mainframe, as well as the local dial-up points, which allowed users all over the country access for the cost of a local telephone call. Specification: * 1 megaword 36 bit RAM (upgraded for Compunet). * ¬£50,000 per month running costs (including the local-rate telephone call facilities). * Compunet host software written in Fortran, by Ariadne Software and further developed by Robert Foot with chat and real-time user and management accounting. When ADP announced it was to shut down its DEC-10 network in Great Portland Street, Central London, Nick Green then consultant to Compunet and Mark Clarke (ex Commodore guru) researched closely coupled multi-micro architectures. Compunet was rewritten in C and migrated to a VME rack configured by Cambridge Micro Computers in the Park Royal Industrial Estate. It ran under OS-9 with a single 25 MHz master board. Specification: * VME bus. * 1 x 6820 for disk access. * 10 megabytes RAM. * 4 x 200 megabyte hard disks for storage. * 3 x 6810s (5 megabytes RAM each) for communications. * 52 simultaneous connections.

In Sanskrit, Dvi = 'two' and Vedi = 'to see'. Therefore, a Dwivedi is one with 'two-fold vision', or someone who is able to distinguish between right and wrong. The practical application is that a Dwivedi was an expert in morality and can guide the public with regards to what is right and wrong. There is no limit to the number of vedas an individual can learn, therefore there is no reason why a Dwivedi or Trivedi could not learn all four vedas.

The Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES) is an infrared spectrometer used for detecting the composition of a material (typically rocks) from a distance. By making its measurements in the thermal infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, it has the ability to penetrate through the dust coatings common to the Martian surface which is usually problematic for remote sensing observations. There is one on each of the two Mars Exploration Rovers. Development The Mini-TES was originally developed by Raytheon for the Department of Geological Sciences at Arizona State University. The Mini-TES is a miniaturized version of Raytheon's Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) TES, built by Arizona State University and Raytheon SAS‚Äô Santa Barbara Remote Sensing. The MGS TES data helped scientists choose landing sites for the Spirit and Opportunity Mars explorer rovers. Martian soil The Mini-TES is used for identifying promising rocks and soils for closer examination, and to determine the processes that formed Martian rocks. It measures the infrared radiation that the target rock or object emits in 167 different wavelengths, providing information about the target's composition. One particular goal is to search for minerals that were formed by the action of water, such as carbonates and clays. The instrument can also look skyward to provide temperature profiles of the Martian atmosphere and detect the abundance of dust and water vapor. The instrument is located inside the warm electronics box in the body of the rover - the mirror redirects radiation into the aperture from above. The Mini-TES instruments aboard the MERs Opportunity and Spirit were never expected to survive the cold Martian winter even if the rovers themselves survived. It was thought that a small potassium bromide (KBr) beamsplitter which was housed in an aluminium fitting would crack due to the mismatched coefficient of thermal expansion. This never happened however and the miniTES instrument on both rovers has survived several Martian winters, and the Spirit rover continues to periodically use the Mini-TES for remote sensing. (The miniTES on the Opportunity rover is not currently being used because of accumulated dust on the mirror following the 2007 dust storm). There are two other types of spectrometers mounted on the rover's arm which provide additional information about the composition when the rover is close enough to touch the object. Mini-Tes can work with Pancams to analyze surroundings. The Mini-TES weighs 2.1 kg (4.6 lb) of the total 185 kg (408 lb) for the whole rover.

The ancient trackway is 100m long and 20m wide. It is located at Newgrange, in County Meath, Ireland. Description A cursus is a ritual procession route, and is typically found within a large Neolithic complex. It is characterized by having a long and narrow track bordered by parallel embankments and ditches. The only gaps in the track are the pathway's entrances and exits. The terminal point of a cursus is an area that is either square or rounded in shape. The Newgrange cursus can be found approximately 100m east of the great passage tomb at Newgrange, in County Meath, Ireland. The ancient route lies on a north-south axis, and is made up of two parallel banks 20m apart. It probably originated from an area that once was a pond, now dried-up, and advances east-west, sloping upwards, to the north of the Newgrange ridge. The southern end of the track is closed off by a U-shaped terminal. Approximately 100 m of the prehistoric track exists today. History Newgrange Monument Antiquarian, William Stukeley (1687-1765), created the term, \\"cursus\\" in the eighteenth century to describe the long earthwork track at Stonehenge, the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire, England. He initially believed that the route was originally used as a Roman racecourse. The word \\"cursus\\" is Latin for \\"course\\". Today, the word, \\"cursus\\" is used to describe long and narrow trackways or rectangular enclosures that are identified as ancient processional monuments. There are several cursus monuments found in Ireland and Britain. They vary in form, shape, size, and boundary. In Scotland, approximately half of the known cursus monuments have pit or post-hole boundaries. In County Meath, Ireland, the cursus associated with the passage tomb at Loughcrew is bounded by internal ditches and outer banks.

Military Camp Wainwright The Buffalo National Park was closed in 1940 and the property leased by the Government of Alberta to the Department of National Defence (DND) for the creation of an ammunition storage facility as well as an army training camp. DND owned an adjacent property and used the facility for live-fire artillery, armoured and infantry training. Called Wainwright Military Camp, or just Camp Wainwright, after the nearby Canadian National Railways division point, the facility saw use from January 29, 1945, to May 24, 1946, as a prisoner of war (POW) internment camp for 523 captured German officers, soldiers and civilians from its first day of operation to 1,100 POWs at its peak. During the 16 months the POW camp was in full operation, only two prisoners made a successful escape, although they were recaptured just over a month later, but not until they had reached Gary, Indiana.CFB Wainwright history Decommissioned as a POW internment camp in 1946, Camp Wainwright reverted to a Canadian Army training facility. The camp staff and guard company were reduced to nil strength a few weeks later, marking the end of this chapter of CFB/ASU Wainwright's history. Wainwright's infrastructure expanded significantly during the Korean War as buildings were constructed to house and train soldiers in three Canadian Army battalions, as well as units that would form British Commonwealth Forces Korea such as the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade. The February 1, 1968 merger of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force to form the Canadian Forces was predated by a number of major changes to Canada's military structure. One of these saw Camp Wainwright transferred on January 1, 1967, to become an auxiliary satellite training camp of CFB Calgary. This was reverted on August 1, 1967, due to command and control problems, and Camp Wainwright became Canadian Forces Base Wainwright (CFB Wainwright) as a separate entity within the establishment of CFB Calgary. An airfield was opened at CFB Wainwright in October 1967 and at the time of official unification, CFB Wainwright became a component of Training Command as the facility was tasked as a training area. CFB Wainwright offered both officer and basic training courses, battalion-level unit operations and acted as a host for training foreign detachments. Wainwright also offered administrative support services for 1 Canadian Brigade Group units. Subsequent changes to the force structure saw Wainwright's role as a training facility evolve, particularly as the garrisons at CFB Calgary and CFB Edmonton shifted some of their training to the newly established and much larger CFB Suffield. On July 15, 1974, the 1 Combat Group Operational Training Detachment was formed at CFB Wainwright to conduct individual training for two or more units of Mobile Command's 1 Combat Group. In 1983, CFB Wainwright consisted of the training facilities, the 742 Communication Detachment and a British Army liaison detachment. Defence cuts following the end of the Cold War during the 1990s resulted in the closure of CFB Calgary and consolidation of units at CFB Edmonton. CFB Wainwright was also impacted by defence cuts and was reduced to an Area Support Unit (ASU). ASU Wainwright, as the facility is also called, has 690 military personnel and 300 civilian workers. As part of 1 Area Support Group (ASG), it hosts the Land Force Western Area Training Centre (LFWATC) and the Canadian Manoeuvre Training Centre (CMTC), as well as the following units: * 742 Signal Squadron Detachment * 1 Field Ambulance Detachment * 1 Dental Detachment * 1 Garrison Military Police Company detachment * 1 Engineer Equipment Troop The transient military population averages over 1,000 personnel at any given time, and in the summer it grows significantly when hundreds of primary reservists undertake annual training. As of 2009 it is the main training base of the 1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, including Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), and covers an area of , which includes 25 weapons ranges. Although primarily a training base for the Canadian Army it is also used by the Royal Canadian Air Force to train fighter bombers and search and rescue practice. The base also includes Wainwright/Wainwright (Field 21) Airport () located west of Wainwright, approximately west of CFB Wainright, with a asphalt runway. The Wainwright Military Family Resource Centre (MFRC), located on CFB Wainwright, provides resources and support for military families. Since 1942, 140 Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps Cayuga has operated on CFB Wainwright. In 2015, 3003 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps Battle River (PPCLI) was relocated to CFB Wainwright from Edgerton, Alberta.

The magazine was initially created for Meccano builders, but it soon became a general hobby magazine aimed at \\"boys of all ages\\". History The magazine was launched by Frank Hornby, the inventor of Meccano, as a bi-monthly publication in 1916 in the United States as \\"Meccano Engineer\\", and was a month ahead of the UK issue. The first copies were given away free but in 1918 readers had to pay two pence for postage for four issues. In 1917 and again in 1932 Hornby published a history of Meccano, its manufacture, and marketing in the magazine. In 1919 it doubled its size to eight pages and now cost one penny. New Meccano parts were advertised for the first time in 1920 and in 1922 the magazine became a monthly publication. From 1921, the magazine was edited by Ellison Hawks who worked at Meccano as an advertising manager. From the May 1924 issue, the magazine had full-colour covers, and the December 1924 issue was 96 pages, costing six pence. By the 1930s Meccano Magazine had a circulation of 70,000. During the Second World War the content and quality of the magazine was reduced greatly, and the size decreased from approximately A4 to A5. The A5 pocket-size format remained until 1961 when it was increased again to A4. In 1963 the magazine started reporting a loss and Meccano Ltd handed its publishing over to its printers, Thomas Skinner. In August 1967 Thomas Skinner terminated production of the magazine and passed the magazine on to Model & Allied Publications (MAP) of Hemel Hempstead in 1968. At the end of 1972 publication stopped due to a decline in popularity. In April 1973 it was resurrected again, this time as a quarterly magazine, and from 1977 it incorporated Meccano Engineer and the Meccanoman's Journal. Meccano Magazine's last issue was Spring 1981. Content Meccano Magazine was originally aimed at Meccano builders and featured articles on Meccano construction and new Meccano developments. When Frank Hornby launched the Meccano Guild in 1919, the magazine carried regular Guild news to keep Meccano clubs informed of each other's activities. But over time Meccano Magazine became a general hobby magazine aimed at \\"boys of all ages\\". Aside from Meccano related articles, it also featured Hornby trains, Dinky Toys and other products of Meccano Ltd, plus a wide variety of general interest articles, including, engineering, aircraft, trains, modelling, camping, photography and philately. Commonwealth countries always featured strongly in articles as Meccano Ltd exported its products to these countries. The magazines today are an excellent source of historic information and an invaluable aid to collectors of toys from those years. They have also become collector's items and there is a healthy trade in them at auctions.

He is renowned for his hit song \\"Sweet Mother\\", recorded with his band Rocafil Jazz, which has been described as the best-selling song in history by an African recording artist. Music He played the xylophone, conga, drums, bass guitar and electric guitar. He first started playing in school bands and he made his professional debut as a member of a hotel band, the Melody Orchestra, in 1970. Career =Early years= Although he only recorded one significant hit, \\"Sweet Mother,\\" in 1976, which sold more than 13 million copies (and which is recognised as one of Africa's greatest songs), Mbarga played an important role in the evolution of African popular music. With his soulful vocals set to the light melodies of his acoustic guitar, Mbarga created a unique hybrid of Nigerian and Congolese guitar playing and uplifting highlife rhythms. He formed his own group, Rocafil Jazz, to perform regularly at the Plaza Hotel in the eastern Nigerian city of Onitsha. After releasing a disappointing single in 1973, Mbarga and Rocafil Jazz had their first success with their second single, I No Go Marry My Papa, which became a regional hit. The band's inability to break past their local following resulted in their recording contract being dropped by EMI, a decision that proved ill-fortuned when the band signed with Rogers All Stars, a Nigerian recording company based in Onitsha, and recorded \\"Sweet Mother\\". Sung in Pidgin, \\"Sweet Mother\\" became one of the top sellers in the history of Nigerian music. In the six years that Mbarga and Rocafil Jazz remained with Rogers All Stars, 1975 to 1981, they recorded nine albums. =Later years= On a repeat tour to England in 1982, Mbarga became known for his flamboyant, 1970s glam rock-inspired performances. While he continued to appear with Rocafil Jazz, Mbarga also performed with London-based highlife band the Ivory Coasters and former Rocafil Jazz member, Cameroonian vocalist Louisiana Tilda. Despite Mbarga launching his own Polydor-distributed record label, upon his return to Nigeria, he and the original members of Rocafil Jazz separated after some disagreements. Although he later formed the New Rocafil Jazz Band, Mbarga failed to match his early success. Leaving music, he turned his attention to managing the four-star hotel that he owned, the Sweet Mother Hotel, located in the town of Ikom in Cross River State Nigeria, just minutes away from the Cameroon-Nigeria border.

Computation happens as a side effect of data transports: writing data into a triggering port of a functional unit triggers the functional unit to start a computation. This is similar to what happens in a systolic array. Due to its modular structure, TTA is an ideal processor template for application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIP) with customized datapath but without the inflexibility and design cost of fixed function hardware accelerators. Typically a transport triggered processor has multiple transport buses and multiple functional units connected to the buses, which provides opportunities for instruction level parallelism. The parallelism is statically defined by the programmer. In this respect (and obviously due to the large instruction word width), the TTA architecture resembles the very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture. A TTA instruction word is composed of multiple slots, one slot per bus, and each slot determines the data transport that takes place on the corresponding bus. The fine-grained control allows some optimizations that are not possible in a conventional processor. For example, software can transfer data directly between functional units without using registers. Transport triggering exposes some microarchitectural details that are normally hidden from programmers. This greatly simplifies the control logic of a processor, because many decisions normally done at run time are fixed at compile time. However, it also means that a binary compiled for one TTA processor will not run on another one without recompilation if there is even a small difference in the architecture between the two. The binary incompatibility problem, in addition to the complexity of implementing a full context switch, makes TTAs more suitable for embedded systems than for general purpose computing. Of all the one instruction set computer architectures, the TTA architecture is one of the few that has had processors based on it built, and the only one that has processors based on it sold commercially.  Benefits in comparison to VLIW architectures  TTAs can be seen as \\"exposed datapath\\" VLIW architectures. While VLIW is programmed using operations, TTA splits the operation execution to multiple move operations. The low level programming model enables several benefits in comparison to the standard VLIW. For example, a TTA architecture can provide more parallelism with simpler register files than with VLIW. As the programmer is in control of the timing of the operand and result data transports, the complexity (the number of input and output ports) of the register file (RF) need not be scaled according to the worst case issue/completion scenario of the multiple parallel instructions. An important unique software optimization enabled by the transport programming is called software bypassing. In case of software bypassing, the programmer bypasses the register file write back by moving data directly to the next functional unit's operand ports. When this optimization is applied aggressively, the original move that transports the result to the register file can be eliminated completely, thus reducing both the register file port pressure and freeing a general purpose register for other temporary variables. The reduced register pressure, in addition to simplifying the required complexity of the RF hardware, can lead to significant CPU energy savings, an important benefit especially in mobile embedded systems.V. Guzma, P. J√§√§skel√§inen, P. Kellom√§ki, and J. Takala, ‚ÄúImpact of Software Bypassing on Instruction Level Parallelism and Register File Traffic‚Äù Johan Janssen. \\"Compiler Strategies for Transport Triggered Architectures\\". 2001. p. 168.  Structure  TTA processors are built of independent function units and register files, which are connected with transport buses and sockets. Parts of transport triggered architecture = Function unit = Each function unit implements one or more operations, which implement functionality ranging from a simple addition of integers to a complex and arbitrary user-defined application-specific computation. Operands for operations are transferred through function unit ports. Each function unit may have an independent pipeline. In case a function unit is fully pipelined, a new operation that takes multiple clock cycles to finish can be started in every clock cycle. On the other hand, a pipeline can be such that it does not always accept new operation start requests while an old one is still executing. Data memory access and communication to outside of the processor is handled by using special function units. Function units that implement memory accessing operations and connect to a memory module are often called load/store units. = Control unit = Control unit is a special case of function units which controls execution of programs. Control unit has access to the instruction memory in order to fetch the instructions to be executed. In order to allow the executed programs to transfer the execution (jump) to an arbitrary position in the executed program, control unit provides control flow operations. A control unit usually has an instruction pipeline, which consists of stages for fetching, decoding and executing program instructions. = Register files = Register files contain general purpose registers, which are used to store variables in programs. Like function units, also register files have input and output ports. The number of read and write ports, that is, the capability of being able to read and write multiple registers in a same clock cycle, can vary in each register file. = Transport buses and sockets = Interconnect architecture consists of transport buses which are connected to function unit ports by means of sockets. Due to expense of connectivity, it is usual to reduce the number of connections between units (function units and register files). A TTA is said to be fully connected in case there is a path from each unit output port to every unit's input ports. Sockets provide means for programming TTA processors by allowing to select which bus-to-port connections of the socket are enabled at any time instant. Thus, data transports taking place in a clock cycle can be programmed by defining the source and destination socket/port connection to be enabled for each bus. = Conditional execution = Some TTA implementations support conditional execution. Conditional execution is implemented with the aid of guards. Each data transport can be conditionalized by a guard, which is connected to a register (often a 1-bit conditional register) and to a bus. In case the value of the guarded register evaluates to false (zero), the data transport programmed for the bus the guard is connected to is squashed, that is, not written to its destination. Unconditional data transports are not connected to any guard and are always executed. = Branches = All processors, including TTA processors, include control flow instructions that alter the program counter, which are used to implement subroutines, if-then-else, for-loop, etc. The assembly language for TTA processors typically includes control flow instructions such as unconditional branches (JUMP), conditional relative branches (BNZ), subroutine call (CALL), conditional return (RETNZ), etc. that look the same as the corresponding assembly language instructions for other processors. Like all other operations on a TTA machine, these instructions are implemented as \\"move\\" instructions to a special function unit. TTA implementations that support conditional execution, such as the sTTAck and the first MOVE prototype, can implement most of these control flow instructions as a conditional move to the program counter. Henk Corporaal. \\"Transport Triggered Architectures examined for general purpose applications\\". p. 6. Aliaksei V. Chapyzhenka. \\"sTTAck: Stack Transport Triggered Architecture\\". TTA implementations that only support unconditional data transports, such as the MAXQ, typically have a special function unit tightly connected to the program counter that responds to a variety of destination addresses. Each such address, when used as the destination of a \\"move\\", has a different effect on the program counter‚Äîeach \\"relative branch <condition>\\" instruction has a different destination address for each condition; and other destination addresses are used CALL, RETNZ, etc.  Programming  In more traditional processor architectures, a processor is usually programmed by defining the executed operations and their operands. For example, an addition instruction in a RISC architecture could look like the following. add r3, r1, r2 This example operation adds the values of general-purpose registers r1 and r2 and stores the result in register r3. Coarsely, the execution of the instruction in the processor probably results in translating the instruction to control signals which control the interconnection network connections and function units. The interconnection network is used to transfer the current values of registers r1 and r2 to the function unit that is capable of executing the add operation, often called ALU as in Arithmetic-Logic Unit. Finally, a control signal selects and triggers the addition operation in ALU, of which result is transferred back to the register r3. TTA programs do not define the operations, but only the data transports needed to write and read the operand values. Operation itself is triggered by writing data to a triggering operand of an operation. Thus, an operation is executed as a side effect of the triggering data transport. Therefore, executing an addition operation in TTA requires three data transport definitions, also called moves. A move defines endpoints for a data transport taking place in a transport bus. For instance, a move can state that a data transport from function unit F, port 1, to register file R, register index 2, should take place in bus B1. In case there are multiple buses in the target processor, each bus can be utilized in parallel in the same clock cycle. Thus, it is possible to exploit data transport level parallelism by scheduling several data transports in the same instruction. An addition operation can be executed in a TTA processor as follows: r1 -> ALU.operand1 r2 -> ALU.add.trigger ALU.result -> r3 The second move, a write to the second operand of the function unit called ALU, triggers the addition operation. This makes the result of addition available in the output port 'result' after the execution latency of the 'add'. The ports associated with the ALU may act as an accumulator, allowing creation of macro instructions that abstract away the underlying TTA: lda r1 ; \\"load ALU\\": move value to ALU operand 1 add r2 ; add: move value to add trigger sta r3 ; \\"store ALU\\": move value from ALU result  Programmer visible operation latency  The leading philosophy of TTAs is to move complexity from hardware to software. Due to this, several additional hazards are introduced to the programmer. One of them is delay slots, the programmer visible operation latency of the function units. Timing is completely the responsibility of the programmer. The programmer has to schedule the instructions such that the result is neither read too early nor too late. There is no hardware detection to lock up the processor in case a result is read too early. Consider, for example, an architecture that has an operation add with latency of 1, and operation mul with latency of 3. When triggering the add operation, it is possible to read the result in the next instruction (next clock cycle), but in case of mul, one has to wait for two instructions before the result can be read. The result is ready for the 3rd instruction after the triggering instruction. Reading a result too early results in reading the result of a previously triggered operation, or in case no operation was triggered previously in the function unit, the read value is undefined. On the other hand, result must be read early enough to make sure the next operation result does not overwrite the yet unread result in the output port. Due to the abundance of programmer-visible processor context which practically includes, in addition to register file contents, also function unit pipeline register contents and/or function unit input and output ports, context saves required for external interrupt support can become complex and expensive to implement in a TTA processor. Therefore, interrupts are usually not supported by TTA processors, but their task is delegated to an external hardware (e.g., an I/O processor) or their need is avoided by using an alternative synchronization/communication mechanism such as polling. Implementations *MAXQ \\"MAXQ Family User's Guide\\". Section \\"1.1 Instruction Set\\" says \\"A register-based, transport-triggered architecture allows all instructions to be coded as simple transfer operations.

Painter His work favored expression over formal likeness. He also avoided anything he deemed to be slick or sentimental. This led him to create landscapes with intentionally distorted spatial features. Still his work was in no way abstract as it took elements from earlier Yuan masters. His views on expression had importance to later \\"individualist\\" painters. Art theory National Museum, Warsaw. He considered there to be a Northern school, represented by Zhe, and a Southern school represented by literati painters. These names are misleading as they refer to Northern and Southern schools of Chan Buddhism thought rather than geographic areas. Hence a Northern painter could be geographically from the south and a Southern painter geographically from the north. In any event he strongly favored the Southern school and dismissed the Northern school as superficial or merely decorative. His ideal of Southern school painting was one where the artist forms a new style of individualistic painting by building on and transforming the style of traditional masters. This was to correspond with sudden enlightenment, as favored by Southern Chan Buddhism. He was a great admirer of Mi Fu and Ni Zan. By relating to the ancient masters' style, artists are to create a place for themselves within the tradition, not by mere imitation, but by extending and even surpassing the art of the past. Dong's theories, combining veneration of past masters with a creative forward looking spark, would be very influential on Qing Dynasty artistsEdmund Capon and Mae Anna Pang, Chinese Paintings of the Ming and Qing Dynasties Catalogue 1981, International Cultural Corporation of Australia Ltd. as well as collectors, \\"especially some of the newly rich collectors of Sungchiang, Huichou in Southern Anhui, Yangchou, and other places where wealth was concentrated in this period\\".James Cahill, The Painter's Practice: How Artists Lived and Worked in Traditional China. New York: Columbia University Press, 1994, p. 11 Together with other early self-appointed arbiters of taste known as the Nine Friends, he helped determine which painters were to be considered collectible (or not). As Cahill points out, such men were the forerunners of today's art historians. His classifications were quite perceptive and he is credited with being \\"the first art historian to do more than list and grade artists.\\"Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.4 (Facts on File, 2005): 683. Scholar and calligrapher Dong Qichang was a native of Hua Ting (located in modern day Shanghai), the son of a teacher and somewhat precocious as a child. At 12 he passed the prefectural Civil service entrance examination and won a coveted spot at the prefectural Government school. He first took the imperial civil service exam at seventeen, but placed second to a cousin because his calligraphy was clumsy. This led him to train until he became a noted calligrapher. Once this occurred he rose up the ranks of the imperial service passing the highest level at the age of 35. He rose to an official position with the Ministry of Rites.Lawrence Gowing, ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.4 (Facts on File, 2005): 682. His positions in the bureaucracy were not without controversy. In 1605 he was giving the exam when the candidates demonstrated against him causing his temporary retirement. In other cases he insulted and beat women who came to his home with grievances. That led to his house being burned down by an angry mob. He also had the tense relations with the eunuchs common to the scholar bureaucracy. Dong's tomb in Songjiang District was vandalized during the Cultural Revolution, and his body dressed in official Ming court robes, was desecrated by Red Guards.

He was the Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics at Harvard University and Adjunct Professor of Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona. Born in New York City, he was awarded one half of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for his contribution to the quantum theory of optical coherence\\", with the other half shared by John L. Hall and Theodor W. H√§nsch. In this work, published in 1963, he created a model for photodetection and explained the fundamental characteristics of different types of light, such as laser light (see coherent state) and light from light bulbs (see blackbody). His theories are widely used in the field of quantum optics.R. J. Glauber, Quantum Theory of Optical Coherence. Selected Papers and Lectures, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 2007. (A collection of reprints of Glauber's most important papers from 1963 to 1999, selected by the author.) In statistical physics he pioneered the study of the dynamics of first-order phase transitions, since he first defined and investigated the stochastic dynamics of an Ising model in a largely influential paper published in 1963. He served on the National Advisory Board of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, the research arms of Council for a Livable World. Education Glauber was born in 1925 in New York City, the son of Felicia (Fox) and Emanuel B. Glauber. He was a member of the 1941 graduating class of the Bronx High School of Science, the first graduating class from that school. He then went on to do his undergraduate work at Harvard University. After his sophomore year he was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project, where (at the age of 18) he was one of the youngest scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His work involved calculating the critical mass for the atom bomb. After two years at Los Alamos, he returned to Harvard, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1946 and his PhD in 1949. Research Glauber's recent research dealt with problems in a number of areas of quantum optics, a field which, broadly speaking, studies the quantum electrodynamical interactions of light and matter. He also continued work on several topics in high-energy collision theory, including the analysis of hadron collisions, and the statistical correlation of particles produced in high-energy reactions. Specific topics of his research included: the quantum mechanical behavior of trapped wave packets; interactions of light with trapped ions; atom counting-the statistical properties of free atom beams and their measurement; algebraic methods for dealing with fermion statistics; coherence and correlations of bosonic atoms near the Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation; the theory of continuously monitored photon counting-and its reaction on quantum sources; the fundamental nature of \\"quantum jumps\\"; resonant transport of particles produced multiply in high-energy collisions; the multiple diffraction model of proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering. Awards and honors Glauber received many honors for his research, including the Albert A. Michelson Medal from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia (1985), the Max Born Award from the Optical Society of America (1985), the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics from the American Physical Society (1996), and the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics. Professor Glauber was awarded the 'Medalla de Oro del CSIC' ('CSIC's Gold Medal') in a ceremony held in Madrid, Spain. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1997. =Ig Nobel= For many years before winning his Nobel Prize, Glauber was familiar to audiences of the Ig Nobel Prize ceremonies, where he took a bow each year as \\"Keeper of the Broom,\\" sweeping the stage clean of the paper airplanes that have traditionally been thrown during the event. He missed the 2005 event, though, as he was being awarded his real Nobel Prize for Physics. Personal life Glauber lived in Arlington, Massachusetts. Glauber was a guest scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1967, during a sabbatical. Glauber had a son and a daughter, and five grandchildren. He died on December 26, 2018 in Newton, Massachusetts. His remains were laid to rest in Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, NY. References External links *2013 Video Interview with Roy Glauber by Cynthia C.

Other names, such as \\"thallophytes\\", \\"lower plants\\", and \\"spore plants\\" are also occasionally used. As a group, Cryptogamae are the opposite of the Phanerogamae (Greek , = \\"visible\\") or Spermatophyta (Greek , = \\"seed\\" and , = \\"plant\\"), the seed plants. The best-known groups of cryptogams are algae, lichens, mosses and ferns, but it also includes non-photosynthetic organisms traditionally classified as plants, such as fungi, slime molds, and bacteria. The classification is now deprecated in Linnaean taxonomy. At one time, the cryptogams were formally recognised as a group within the plant kingdom. In his system for classification of all known plants and animals, Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778) divided the plant kingdom into 24 classes, one of which was the \\"Cryptogamia\\". This included all plants with concealed reproductive organs. He divided Cryptogamia into four orders: Algae, Musci (bryophytes), Filices (ferns), and Fungi. Not all cryptogams are treated as part of the plant kingdom; the fungi, in particular, are regarded as a separate kingdom, more closely related to animals than plants, while blue-green algae are now regarded as a phylum of bacteria. Therefore, in contemporary plant systematics, \\"Cryptogamae\\" is not a taxonomically coherent group, but is cladistically polyphyletic. However, all organisms known as cryptogams belong to the field traditionally studied by botanists and the names of all cryptogams are regulated by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. During World War II, the British Government Code and Cypher School recruited Geoffrey Tandy, a marine biologist expert in cryptogams, to Station X, Bletchley Park when someone confused these with cryptograms.

It originally aired on July 24, 2002. This episode mocks kidnapping, moral panics, and the Mongol conquest of China. The episode was also the last to feature Tweek as the \\"fourth friend\\" alongside Stan, Kyle and Cartman. In the episode, the parents of South Park hire the owner and operator of the local City Wok, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim, to build a Great Wall around the city to protect their children from kidnappers. Just as Mr. Tuong Lu Kim almost finishes the wall, Mongolians arrive to try to break through. When a study reveals that nine out of ten abduction cases are committed by the mother or the father, the parents send their kids out on their own so they won't have a fear of being kidnapped by their parents. In the summer of 2013, fans voted \\"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\\" as the best episode of Season 6.Season 6 Summer of South Park  Plot  With the media full of school shootings, terrorist threats, and child abductions, the parents of South Park grow excessively concerned about the safety of their children. Tweek is scared the most by the media reports, and his parents serve only to exacerbate his fears by turning their house into a virtual prison and playing cruel intellectual games with him designed by intention to increase his safety. As a result, Tweek loses his ability to empathize with others - even refusing to assist a crippled person, whose powerchair ran out of battery power, and is now stuck on some train tracks, resulting in him getting killed by an oncoming train. After a real child abductor (pretending to be the \\"Ghost of Human Kindness\\") fails to kidnap Tweek, the parents of South Park are put on high alert. Taking advantage of expensive technology, the City commissions the owner of City Wok, Mr. Lu Kim to build a huge wall around the city similar to the Great Wall of China. Media reports continue to file in ‚Äî it first convinces them they should not leave their children alone for a moment, prompting the parents to go with them anywhere they go. A later report convinces them they cannot even trust their own neighbors and family friends, forcing the parents to sever ties with each other. The kids, annoyed and embarrassed by their parents' actions, initially blame Tweek for their parents' paranoia, but soon decide that they'd have inevitably resorted to something this stupid eventually. Despite trying to avoid being a stereotype and having no experience in construction, Mr. Kim reluctantly agrees to build the wall. He builds a very impressive one single- handedly. After he is finished, a band of Mongols appear out of nowhere and attack the wall because: \\"Every time us Chinese put up a wall stupid Mongorianzh have to come and knock it down,\\" as he puts it, in a reference to Chinese history. Although he tries desperately to rout the enemy by himself, he proves to be no match for the Mongols' increasingly clever tactics, which include redirecting a heat-seeking missile with a flaming baseball and making use of a Trojan Horse filled with sweet and sour pork. Enraged, Kim vows vengeance for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, back within the town a news report states that the parents are most likely to abduct their own children. Blindly believing what they have been told, they send their children from the city in a tearful ceremony in order to avoid putting their children in danger of being kidnapped by their own parents. As they leave, the children wonder about how stupid their parents are sometimes. Within the week, the children join forces with the Mongols, having apparently learned their language, and expressing anger at their parents' irresponsible and irrational behavior. The Mongols then move on the wall again, where Mr. Kim is dressed for battle. He then does his \\"war dance\\", but while he is doing this, the children wheel a large cart laden with explosives in behind him and blow up the wall. The parents arrive to investigate the explosion, and are reunited with their kids. They realize that they overreacted to the news stories, and that to cut themselves off from the rest of the world with the wall denies new possibilities. Mayor McDaniels orders Mr. Lu Kim to \\"tear down this wall,\\" angering him once more since building the wall was a waste of time. Despite the reunion, the parents believe their children have forgotten them in the short space of four days and use simple English to convince them to return home (with Stan muttering to Kyle, \\"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ.\\"). Production According to the DVD commentary, the episode was done right after the creators saw the Elizabeth Smart abduction in Utah on the news. Parker and Stone came up with the line \\"Goddamn Mongorianzh, no more breaking down my shitty warr!\\" while on the Great Wall of China in the 1990s. Cultural references When Mr. Kim gets ready to shoot the heat seeking missile, he introduces it to the Mongolians saying \\"Say herro to my rittre friend.\\" This is a reference to the movie Scarface. Mayor McDaniels' line \\"Mr. Lu Kim, tear down this wall!\\" is a reference to Ronald Reagan's 1987 speech challenging Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. Home release \\"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\\", along with the sixteen other episodes from South Park's sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.

The station is served by Sydney Trains T8 Airport & South line services. The station was designed and built by the NSW Government Railways. It is also known as the Beverly Hills Railway Station group and Dumbleton Railway Station. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Beverly Hills is unique amongst original East Hills Line stations as it is the only station with asymmetrical platforms, that is, Platform 1 is curved but Platform 2 is straight. It was one of the last stations in Sydney to use Edmondson-style paper tickets.Statement of Heritage Impact:Kingsgrove-Revesby Quadruplication Comber Consultants History The first European settlement in the area was the establishment of a farm known as \\"Dumbleton\\" in the 1830s. The area south of the railway line was part of John Townson's grant of 1810. The area remained semi-rural until the construction of the East Hills line and the railway station. The main impetus for the construction of the East Hills line was from the real estate industry, which wanted to develop the area where the line was proposed. However construction of the line was delayed, and it became an unemployment relief project during the course of its construction due to the onset of the Great Depression. \\"The Public Works Committee recommended the line to State Parliament in August, 1924, expecting a small operating profit and opening up good building land. The debate on the Bill to construct the line took only 15 minutes after it was introduced at 5.12am on 17 December 1924, and the Governors assent given on 23 December, but no funds were provided. Just before the State elections in 1927, the Premier, Jack Lang, performed the \\"Turning of the First Sod\\" ceremony at Padstow on 3 September 1927, but he lost the election. However, the new non-labour government in April 1928, instructed the Railways Commissioners to commence work on the line.\\" Jack Lang was Premier for two periods: the first from June 1925 to October 1927, the second period (during the Depression) from October 1930 to May 1932. Lang was therefore again Premier when he officially opened the East Hills line at Padstow Railway Station in 1931, with the section as far as Kingsgrove being a double track electrified line. All platform buildings on the East Hills line were built to the same general design and plan, which was revised after initial planning to include a booking office, Station Master's office and parcels office. The platform at Beverly Hills is unique on the line by having the' Down' side straight and the \\"Up\\" side curved. Beverly Hills station opened on 21 December 1931 as Dumbleton when the line was extended from Kingsgrove to East Hills. It was renamed Beverly Hills on 24 August 1940.Berverly Hills Station NSWrail.net The line through the station was duplicated in 1948. The line was electrified from Kingsgrove in 1939, duplicated in 1948, and in 1987 the East Hills terminus was connected to the Main Southern Line at Glenfield Junction. Dumbleton was renamed Beverly Hills in 1940, and the railway station was also renamed. In the post war period of the 1940s and 1950s migrant hostels and housing commission estates were developed in suburbs along the line. Although the original terminus building at East Hills Station was demolished in 1987, the remainder of the East Hills Line from Turrella to Panania is the only line in Sydney with all platform buildings extant from its original construction phase (though some have been altered). In 2007 a lift to the platform was built along with steel awning that covered the stairs and extended to the building from street level. The station has the distinction of being one of the last in Sydney to sell \\"Edmondson\\" card type tickets. Construction work was underway in 2009 to upgrade the East Hills line generally following quadruplification of the line. In 2013, as part of the quadruplication of the line from Kingsgrove to Revesby, through lines were added on either side of the existing pair.Kingsgrove to Revesby Quadruplication Project Profile Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Platforms & services Transport links Punchbowl Bus Company operates one route via Beverly Hills station: *450: Strathfield to Hurstville via Belfield, Lakemba and Roselands Transit Systems operate one route via Beverly Hills station: *493: Roselands Shopping Centre to Rockdale station via Kingsgrove, Bexley North and Bexley Transdev NSW operates one route via Beverly Hills station *452: to Rockdale station via Hurstville, Forest Road and Bexley Beverly Hills station is served by one NightRide route: *N20: Riverwood station to Town Hall station via Narwee, Rockdale and Airport  Description  The complex comprises a type 13 platform building, completed in 1931; the platform, also completed in 1931; the King Georges Road Overbridge, completed in 1931; and the stairs, lift, and platform canopy, completed in 2007. ;Context The station has one island platform with entry via sets of stairs on the east and west sides of the King Georges Road overbridge, which enter the west end of the platform. The west end of the platform extends under the road overbridge. The station perimeter is defined with white powder coated aluminium fencing. ;Platform building (1931) Exterior: A rectangular dark face brick platform building of standard stretcher bond brickwork, of 5 bays length (note most platform buildings on this line are 5 bays), with the bays defined by simple brick engaged piers. The building has a brick stepped parapet at the east end only. The roof is gabled at the east end against the parapet at this end, is hipped over awnings to north and south which are an integral part of the roof form, and is hipped at the western end. Roof cladding is corrugated steel. The stepped parapet at the east end features a projecting moulded brick capping course and 3 vertical lines of projecting decorative brickwork, as well as a pair of rectangular timber louvred vents. When planned, a hipped roof wrapped around a stepped parapet at the western end (similar to that at Bexley North). The roof was originally clad with corrugated fibro asbestos sheeting with terra cotta ridge capping. This has been replaced with a corrugated steel roof with a fully hipped end, and it is presumed that (as at Padstow) the original stepped parapet at the east end elevation has been demolished. Two windows have been bricked up. There are timber framed fixed obscure glass windows- the windows are modern, the timber frames original. There are modern timber flush doors. There are bullnosed brick sills to windows, shallow brick arches above doors and windows, stop chamfered brickwork to door and window openings. Windows are timber-framed double-hung, some with original 6-paned top sashes, or small timber framed windows with frameless glass or glass louvres. Original door openings have grey terrazzo thresholds. There are modern fibre cement sheet ceilings to the awnings. There is an aluminium framed glazed panel to the ticket window at the entry end of the platform. Interior:Not accessed 2009 The building interior (following extension in 1950) comprised a combined booking/parcels office (now also the Station Master's room), ladies toilets, waiting room and men's toilets. The interior fitout has been refurbished in 1998 and again in 2004. ;Platform (1931) One island platform, asphalt surface, original brick faces. ;Stairs, lift and platform canopy (2007) A platform canopy structure on steel posts with concrete bases extends from the entry steps at the western end of the platform to the western end of the platform building. A modern lift, stairs and canopies over the stairs. ;King Georges Road overbridge (1931) Original jack arched bridge with modern concrete girders. Original brick abutments and central brick pier remain. Span reconstruction c. 1960s. = Condition = The platform building, completed in 1931, is assessed in good condition; the platform, also erected in 1931, is also in good condition; the King Georges Road Overbridge, completed in 1931, is in good condition; and the stairs, lift and platform canopy, completed in 2007, are assessed as being in very good condition. The platform building has retained a moderate degree of integrity externally, however one of its parapets has been demolished and some openings bricked up. The platform entry arrangements and interior of the platform building have also been modernised 2004‚Äì2007. The King Georges Road overbridge is also considerably altered. This is one of the least intact of the East Hills line stations (with a similar level of alteration to Padstow). = Modifications and dates = *1948: line duplicated. *1950: Extension to platform building to create a combined booking and parcels office, matching brickwork. *s: Span reconstruction to 1931 King Georges Road overbridge. *1998: interior fitout alterations to 1931 platform building *2004‚Äì2007: Interior fitout alterations to 1931 platform building.

A number of window openings have been bricked up. New timber flush doors. Modern ticket window.  Heritage listing  As at 30 November 2010, Beverly Hills Railway Station ‚Äì including the 1931 platform and platform building and King Georges Road overbridge ‚Äì has historical significance as a major public work completed as an unemployment relief project during the Great Depression, and as a major transport hub for the suburb of Beverly Hills since 1931. Beverly Hills railway station platform building is of aesthetic significance as an austere 1930s railway building with simple Art Deco detailing and fine brick workmanship that is evocative of the effects of the Depression on building programs for large organisations such as the NSW railways. Beverly Hills Railway Station is representative of the cohesive collection of ten East Hills line railway stations from Turrella to East Hills. Beverly Hills railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Beverly Hills Railway Station is of historical significance as part of the East Hills line, a major Depression period public work undertaken under the controversial Premiership of Jack Lang, and through its relationship to the development of the suburb of Beverly Hills and the broader East Hills region. The austere design of the platform building is reflective of the completion of the East Hills line as a Depression period unemployment relief works project. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Beverly Hills Railway Station platform building is of aesthetic significance as an example of a small Inter- War period suburban railway station platform building matching other East Hills line platform buildings in design and style. The building is very austere in style, with Inter-War Art Deco style touches and is competently executed, exhibiting fine workmanship in its brickwork. The building is noted for its use of monochromatic brickwork, one extant stepped parapet, irregular fenestration and engaged piers. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Beverly Hills Railway Station is of research significance for its ability to demonstrate design and construction techniques of the Depression period (early 1930s). The building provides insights into NSW Railways experimentation with styles of architecture and adaptation to Depression period economic conditions. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Beverly Hills Railway Station platform building is not rare, as it is part of a group of ten similar to identical Inter-War suburban railway buildings completed in 1931 between Turrella and East Hills. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Beverly Hills Railway Station is a representative example of an East Hills line railway station, with the platform intact and platform building extant but altered, however with modern platform access structures.

His ancestral home was She County, Anhui province.Cihai: Page 2056. He was the grandson of artist Huang Fengliu. He would later be associated with Shanghai and finally Hangzhou. He is considered one of the last innovators in the literati style of painting and is noted for his freehand landscapes. His early painting style showed the influence of Li Liufang (ÊùéÊµÅËä≥), Cheng Sui, Cheng Zhengkui, Kun Can, Hong Ren and the Yuan and Ming masters. It emphasized on the importance of the unification of positive and negative space; dark and light shades. Each brush line is powerful and precise. The compact touches, the graceful outlines and the elegant styles of Xin‚Äôan School of painting (Êñ∞ÂÆâÁîªÊ¥æ) had a profound influence on Huang throughout his life. His style before the age of sixty is called the White-period.Wen, Guanghua (ÊñáÂÖâÂçé) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñáÂåñÈ£éÈááÂΩï¬∑ÂæΩÂ∑ûÊñáÂåñ [Chinese culture and history ¬∑ Huizhou culture] (2010) After sixty years old, Huang went to Guichi. The scenery of Guichi not only attracted the artist, but also had a great impact on his style. Huang changed from focusing on brush and line to focusing on ink and wash. He started to practice the painting style of Wu Zhen. In 1928, Huang visited Guangxi and Guangdong and created a lot of works by sketching the real landscapes. Huang started to transit from his ‚ÄúWhite style‚Äù to ‚ÄúBlack style‚Äù.Wen, Guanghua (ÊñáÂÖâÂçé) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñáÂåñÈ£éÈááÂΩï¬∑ÂæΩÂ∑ûÊñáÂåñ [Chinese culture and history ¬∑ Huizhou culture] (2010) At the age of sixty nine to seventy, Huang visited Sichuan. He was inspired by the atmosphere of Mount Qingcheng in rain and the Qutang Gorge under moonlight. He utilized dripping, staining and layers of dense ink to illustrate the misty wet feeling of rain and the nightly view of mountains. Since then, his \\"black, dense, thick, heavy\\" style became his significant feature.Wen, Guanghua (ÊñáÂÖâÂçé) ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊñáÂåñÈ£éÈááÂΩï¬∑ÂæΩÂ∑ûÊñáÂåñ [Chinese culture and history ¬∑ Huizhou culture] (2010) From 1937 to 1948, Huang lived in Beijing for eleven years and most of his Black period paintings were done during that time. After that, he moved to Hangzhou and started another new horizon in his art. Inspired by Western Impressionism, he integrated the two major Chinese painting systems (Ink and wash painting and color painting) into a unity. Dots of red, green and blue pigment merged with layers of dense ink creating a luxuriant and richly integrated style in which he deftly manipulated solid and void. His varied style and creativity not only won him an honorary title, but also brought light into the modern Chinese art history.Zheng, Chenghang (ÈÉëÊàêËà™) https://news.artron.net/20170330/n919987.html ‚ÄúÂÜÖÁæéÈùôÂèÇ‚Äî‚ÄîÈªÑÂÆæËôπÂ±±Ê∞¥ÁîªÂ±ï‚ÄùÊµôÊ±üÁæéÊúØÈ¶ÜÂºÄÂπï [Huang Binhing Landscape painting exhibition at Zhejiang Art Museum] (2017) He also had significance for creating several societies devoted to painting and calligraphy.

H√§nsch\\". Retrieved 4 March 2019. Subsequently, he became a professor at Stanford University, California from 1975 to 1986. He was awarded the Comstock Prize in Physics from the National Academy of Sciences in 1983. In 1986, he received the Albert A. Michelson Medal from the Franklin Institute. In the same year H√§nsch returned to Germany to head the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Quantenoptik. In 1989, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 2005, he also received the Otto Hahn Award of the City of Frankfurt am Main, the Society of German Chemists and the German Physical Society. In that same year, the Optical Society of America awarded him the Frederic Ives Medal and the status of honorary member in 2008. One of his students, Carl E. Wieman, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001. In 1970 he invented a new type of laser which generated light pulses with an extremely high spectral resolution (i.e. all the photons emitted from the laser had nearly the same energy, to a precision of 1 part in a million). Using this device he succeeded to measure the transition frequency of the Balmer line of atomic hydrogen with a much higher precision than before. During the late 1990s, he and his coworkers developed a new method to measure the frequency of laser light to an even higher precision, using a device called the optical frequency comb generator. This invention was then used to measure the Lyman line of atomic hydrogen to an extraordinary precision of 1 part in a hundred trillion. At such a high precision, it became possible to search for possible changes in the fundamental physical constants of the universe over time. For these achievements he became co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2005. Background to Nobel Prize The Nobel Prize was awarded to Professor H√§nsch in recognition for work that he did at the end of the 1990s at the Max Planck Institute in Garching, near Munich, Germany. He developed an optical \\"frequency comb synthesiser\\", which makes it possible, for the first time, to measure with extreme precision the number of light oscillations per second. These optical frequency measurements can be millions of times more precise than previous spectroscopic determinations of the wavelength of light. The work in Garching was motivated by experiments on the very precise laser spectroscopy of the hydrogen atom. This atom has a particularly simple structure. By precisely determining its spectral line, scientists were able to draw conclusions about how valid our fundamental physical constants are - if, for example, they change slowly with time. By the end of the 1980s, the laser spectroscopy of hydrogen had reached the maximum precision allowed by interferometric measurements of optical wavelengths. The researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics thus speculated about new methods, and developed the optical frequency comb synthesizer. Its name comes from the fact that it generates a light spectrum out of what are originally single-colour, ultrashort pulses of light. This spectrum is made of hundreds of thousands of sharp spectral lines with a constant frequency interval. Such a frequency comb is similar to a ruler. When the frequency of a particular radiation is determined, it can be compared to the extremely acute comb spectral lines, until one is found that \\"fits\\". In 1998, Professor H√§nsch received a Philip Morris Research Prize for the development of this \\"measurement device\\". One of the first applications of this new kind of light source was to determine the frequency of the very narrow ultraviolet hydrogen 1S-2S two-photon transition. Since then, the frequency has been determined with a precision of 15 decimal places. The frequency comb now serves as the basis for optical frequency measurements in large numbers of laboratories worldwide. Since 2002, the company Menlo Systems, in whose foundation the Max Planck Institute in Garching played a role, has been delivering commercial frequency comb synthesizers to laboratories all over the world.

In turn, tunable narrow-linewidth organic lasers, and solid-state lasers, using total illumination of the grating, have had a major impact in laser spectroscopy.W.

It has been anthologized, reprinted, and reissued in pamphlet form many times since then. Socialism from Above is the name given by Draper to philosophies of collectivized property that envision administration from above by an elite, whether intellectual, political, or technical. Socialism from Below would proceed from a very different conception of common ownership, with power instead flowing from the workers themselves, with decision-making capacities broadly distributed. The divide between these two souls of socialism, Draper argues, underlies all other divisions such as \\"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\\" Most of the pamphlet is a detailed typology and strongly worded criticism of various forms of Socialism from Above. Among the practitioners of Socialism from Above, Draper includes such varied forms of socialism as utopian socialism, Communist dictatorship and Stalinism, social democracy, and anarchism. Confessing that Socialism from Below \\"has had few consistent exponents and not many inconsistent ones,\\" he nevertheless identifies it with Marx, \\"whose notion was from the very beginning that the emancipation of the working class must be the act of the working class itself.\\" The piece is organized primarily as a brief history of socialism and important socialist thinkers, beginning with a critical glance at \\"ancestors\\" such as Plato, Pythagoras and the Gracchi before turning to Babeuf, Saint-Simon, and utopians such as Fourier and Owen. Draper then lauds Marx as the first champion of Socialism from Below, \\"who finally fettered the two ideas of Socialism and Democracy together.\\" The next sections of the pamphlet consider in turn subsequent manifestations of Socialism from Above, including anarchists (specifically Proudhon and Bakunin), Lassalle, the Fabians, Eduard Bernstein, and American socialists such as Edward Bellamy. The final sections separate out \\"six strains of Socialism from Above\\" (philanthropism, elitism, plannism, communionism, permeationism, and Socialism from Outside) and conclude with a call to intellectuals \\"to choose the road of Socialism from Below.\\" Notably, the pamphlet does not devote consideration to the question of whether the Soviet Revolution at its inception was guided by the principles of Socialism from Below or Socialism from Above, although the entire pamphlet is implicitly guided by the moral and political opposition to Stalinism that shaped Draper's life work.

It is a beach some in length, forming the coastline where the Great Sandy Desert approaches the Indian Ocean. It is one of the most important sites for migratory shorebirds, or waders, in Australia, and is recognised as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. History =Traditional ownership and usage= Eighty Mile Beach 2011 Eighty Mile Beach shells Eighty Mile Beach 2004 Great knot on Eighty Mile Beach The southern section of Eighty Mile Beach is part of the traditional territory of the Nyangumarta people, who maintain a strong connection to the area with many songs, stories and ceremonies associated with sites along and in the vicinity of the beach. In June 2009 the Federal Court of Australia determined that the Nyangumarta People were the valid native title holders of that section of the beach.. The judgement of the Court was delivered on country at Nyiyamarri Pukurl, a site adjacent to the Eighty Mile Beach Caravan Park. Traditional ownership of the northern part of Eighty Mile Beach, within the vicinity of the Anna Plains pastoral lease, is shared between the Nyangumarta People and the Karajarri (or Garadjari) People. The two groups filed overlapping native title determination applications over the area, which were determined together on 25 May 2012.. The judgement of the Court was delivered on country at Talgarno, a former military site within the Anna Plains pastoral lease. In the Karajarri language, Eighty Mile Beach is called Wender, meaning \\"a creaking noise\\", with reference to the sound of walking through dry sand. Many Aboriginal people with connections to the area now live at the Bidyadanga Community (formerly the La Grange Mission) and nearby at Frazier Downs. Several soaks, known as lirri, lie behind the beach and were traditionally important as sources of fresh water. Many of the soaks became Water Reserves on the Kimberley-De Grey Stock Route, which was used until the 1960s for long distance cattle-droving. =Military use= The Talgarno military base, east of Anna Plains homestead, was important in the post-Second World War period for the monitoring and recovery of British Blue Streak rockets, test-fired from Woomera, South Australia. A gravel airstrip, artesian bores and concrete blockhouses remain. In 1999 the Department of Defence test-fired a missile from a site on Anna Plains, in connection with the development of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar project. =Shorebird research= Because of its importance for shorebirds, Eighty Mile Beach is classified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) and is one of the principal shorebird study sites in north-western Australia. It regularly supports over 400,000 shorebirds, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, red knots, red-necked stints, grey-tailed tattlers, Terek sandpipers, pied oystercatchers, greater sand plovers, Oriental plovers, red-capped plovers and Oriental pratincoles, with irregular high counts of other species. Since 1981 almost yearly expeditions by the Australasian Wader Studies Group have been banding and counting shorebirds there as part of a long-term program of monitoring the populations using the East Asian ‚Äì Australasian Flyway. Since 1992 most birds caught have also been leg-flagged to discover their precise migration routes and staging sites.Minton (2006). Description =Geography= Eighty Mile Beach lies along the thin south-western extension of the Dampierland bioregion (shown in red) Eighty Mile Beach lies in the Shire of Broome in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, in the Dampierland bioregion. It extends south-west from Cape Missiessy in a shallow curve to Cape Keraudren , with its midpoint at . The beach is about 100 m wide and has a gentle gradient. It consists of sand with a high proportion of shelly material, and experiences a very large tidal range with an amplitude of up to 9 m. The adjoining tidal mudflats vary from 1 to 5 km in width. On the landward side it is bordered by dunes, a narrow floodplain and, further inland, by a strip of pindan woodland or shrubland. Most of the land along the coast is covered by four large pastoral leases: Anna Plains, Mandora, Wallal and Pardoo, which are operated principally as cattle stations. =Climate= The climate is semi-arid monsoonal with a hot wet summer and a warm dry winter. Median and mean annual rainfall are 327 mm and 341 mm respectively, with annual evaporation about 3500 mm. There is much variability in rainfall, with significant variation between years as well as the period when the bulk of the rain falls; much is contributed by tropical cyclones, especially from January to March. Ramsar site Some of the beach and adjoining land, as well as the Mandora Marsh, was designated Ramsar Site 480 on 7 June 1990.Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands.Annotated Ramsar List. =Mandora Marsh= Mandora Marsh, also known as the Mandora Salt Marsh, is a diverse wetland complex based on a palaeo-river system. It lies on Mandora Station, with the western end some 30 km from Eighty Mile Beach, beginning on the inland side of the Great Northern Highway, at the western edge of the Great Sandy Desert, in which bioregion it lies. Although it is included in the Eighty Mile Beach Ramsar Site, its environmental values are somewhat different. =Eighty Mile Beach= Great knot Caspian tern Euro, or common wallaroo Flora Along the beach, the primary dunes are stabilised by green birdflower and beach spinifex. Secondary parallel, calcareous dune ridges and swales commonly feature scattered dune wattle. Significant grasses include Whiteochloa airoides and the local endemic Triodia epactia, a resinous hummock-forming species. Inland grasslands have been strongly modified by intensive cattle grazing and are dominated by introduced buffel grass and birdwood grass. Fauna The principal conservation value of Eighty Mile Beach lies in the presence of very large numbers of shorebirds, for which it is one of the most important non-breeding and migratory stop-over areas in the East Asian ‚Äì Australasian Flyway, regularly supporting more than 400,000 birds and especially important as a landfall for birds migrating southwards from their high latitude breeding grounds in northern Asia and Alaska to spend the austral summer in Australia. It is one of the most important sites in the world for the migration of great knot and it supports at least 1% of the flyway population (or 1% of the national population for non-migratory species) of 17 waders and the Caspian tern. The most abundant shorebird species at the beach are the great knot (up to 169,000 counted), bar-tailed godwit (110,000), and red knot (80,000). Other notable species include curlew sandpiper (60,000), red-necked stint (60,000), large sand plover (64,000) and Oriental plover (57,000) on the beach, sharp-tailed sandpiper (25,000) at both the beach and floodplain swamps, and little curlew (12,000) on the floodplain. Flatback turtles nest along Eighty-mile Beach at scattered locations between October and April. Coastal plains in the southern part of Anna Plains Station are a stronghold for Australian bustards and support high densities of red kangaroos. The western part of Wallal Downs has a dense population of euros. Tourism and access Eighty Mile Beach is subject to a relatively low but increasing amount of tourism. A caravan park has been established on Wallal Downs at one of the access points to the beach, 250 km north of Port Hedland and 365 km south of Broome. It is used for fishing, seashell collecting and other beach-based recreation. References =Notes= =Sources= * Livesey, N. J. G.

Location Merchiston Avenue is 1.3 miles Southwest of the West End of Edinburgh's principal street, Princes Street. Other areas near Merchiston include Morningside to the southeast, Burghmuirhead (including Holy Corner and Church Hill) to the east and Bruntsfield to the northeast.  History  The first known reference to Merchiston is found in the 1266 Exchequer Rolls of Scotland. At this point Merchiston consisted of one of a number of independently owned estates to the southwest of the Burgh Muir. Alexander Napier, a wealthy Edinburgh merchant and provost of the city, acquired the estate from King James I in 1436. He or his son, also Alexander Napier, were responsible for the construction of Merchiston Tower in the mid 15th century. Merchiston Castle School was founded in the area in 1828, moving to Merchiston Tower in 1833. Housing The housing is primarily a mixture of large, late Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian villas - several of the latter by Edward Calvert - together with a smaller number of Victorian tenements and some relatively large, early-20th century villas. In recent years many of these villas have been subjected to development with blocks of flats being built in their once expansive gardens and the original houses themselves being divided into small numbers of flats. Education View towards Holy Corner from Colinton Road Merchiston spans the catchment areas for Boroughmuir and Tynecastle secondary schools. Primary education is provided by Craiglockhart Primary School and Bruntsfield Primary School. Also in the area are a number of independent schools including George Watson's College, Merchiston Castle School and a Steiner School. Merchiston Tower A campus forming a major part of Edinburgh Napier University is in the area; it includes Merchiston Tower (or Castle), once the home of John Napier, 8th Laird of Merchiston and the inventor of logarithms. The university also uses a variety of other buildings in this and surrounding areas, such as former schools and churches, some of which would otherwise have been demolished or made into further flats. The tower was sold by the Honourable John Scott Napier, 14th Laird of Merchiston in 1914 to the Merchiston Castle School board who used it up until 1930 when the school moved to a new site at Colinton (whilst retaining the Merchiston Castle name). Transportation On the fringes of the area where it meets Craiglockhart (to the west) is the suburban railway line, which is mooted for reopening. To the north of the area is the Union Canal. North of the canal (in the area sometimes known as North Merchiston or Shandon and sometimes taken to be part of Polwarth) is the site of the former Merchiston railway station, a railway station on the now-closed Caledonian Railway line to Edinburgh Princes Street railway station. Parks Harrison Park, a popular community park roughly 7 hectares in size is located to the northwest of Merchiston. The park provides a range of recreational facilities including pitches, play area, cycle path and a formal garden. Notable people The area is home to writers Ian Rankin (author of the Inspector Rebus novels), Lin Anderson, Colin Douglas, Alexander McCall Smith (author of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels) and comedian Dylan Moran. J. K. Rowling had her Edinburgh home in Merchiston for many years but has since moved to Killiechassie. Merchiston was also the childhood home of Scotland and British Lions rugby players Gavin Hastings and Scott Hastings.

The genus contains about 51 species native to tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world.  Description  The gametophyte is yellowish-green and usually less than one-half cm wide. The thallus branches in a bifurcating pattern. In the subgenus Apoceros, there are cavities in the central strand of the thallus. The edges of the thallus are only a single layer of cells thick and have an undulating margin. It is common to find symbiotic colonies of blue-green bacteria (usually Nostoc) growing among the cells. Under a microscope, the epidermal cells have trigones. The sporophyte is erect when mature, growing up to 5 cm tall. Like other hornworts, its surface has stomata. The interior of the sporophyte differentiates into a central column and a surrounding mass of spores and elater cells, with a distinct spiral. The spores are both green and relatively large with an ornamented surface.  Habitat  Dendroceros grows on humid ground, rocky outcrops, and on the sides of trees.

History Borland‚Äôs Turbo Pascal had a \\"database\\" Toolbox add-on, which was the beginning of the Borland compiler add-ons that facilitated database connectivity. Then came the Paradox Engine for Windows ‚Äì PXENGWIN ‚Äì which could be compiled into a program to facilitate connectivity to Paradox tables. The first DLL-based connectivity engine was ODAPI (Open Database API). It represented Borland‚Äôs attempt to centralise connectivity in its suite of applications that included the brand- new Paradox for Windows 4 and Quattro. With version 4.5 / 5.0 of Paradox for Windows, this database engine was crystallised as IDAPI. In 2000, Borland introduced a new SQL driver architecture called dbExpress, which deprecated BDE SQL links technology. In 2014, Embarcadero removed the BDE installer from its Rad Studio XE7 install, making it a separate download in order to strengthen the message that the BDE has been deprecated for a number of years. Programmers using the BDE are encouraged to update their software to use newer database connectivity technologies like Embarcadero's FireDAC, or third-party- provided solutions. Design The included set of database drivers enables consistent access to standard data sources: Paradox, dBASE, FoxPro, Access, and text databases. You can add Microsoft ODBC drivers as needed to the built- in ODBC socket. Optionally, Borland's SQL Links product provides access to a range of database management systems (DBMS), including Informix, DB2, InterBase, Oracle, and Sybase. BDE is object-oriented in design. At runtime, application developers interact with BDE by creating various BDE objects. These runtime objects are then used to manipulate database entities, such as tables and queries. BDE's application program interface (API) provides direct C and C++ optimized access to the database engine, as well as BDE's built-in drivers for dBASE, Paradox, FoxPro, Access, and text databases. The core database engine files consist of a set of DLLs that are fully re-entrant and thread-safe. Included with BDE are a set of supplemental tools and examples with sample code. BDE system is configured using the BDE Administrator (BDEADMIN.EXE). Included with BDE is Borland's Local SQL, a subset of ANSI-92 SQL enhanced to support Paradox and dBASE (standard) naming conventions for tables and fields (called \\"columns\\" in SQL). Local SQL lets you use SQL to query \\"local\\" standard database tables that do not reside on a database server as well as \\"remote\\" DBMS servers. Local SQL is also essential to make multi- table queries across both local standard tables and those on remote SQL servers.

Career He was headmaster of the Bath School of Art and Design from 1874 to 1877, and then opened his own art school at The Paragon Art Studio, 15 Bladud Buildings, Bath with his wife Elizabeth (Bessie), a well-known miniature portrait artist who exhibited works at the Royal Academy of Art and the Chicago World's Fair, and in 1887 was commissioned by Queen Victoria to produce portraits of herself and her late husband Prince Albert. Plasticine Harbutt invented Plasticine around 1897 as a non-drying modelling clay for use by his students. At the time he was living in Hartley House, Alfred Street, Bath; later moving to The Grange, High Street, Bathampton. In 1899 Harbutt was awarded a trade mark, and in 1900 a factory was set up at nearby Bathampton to manufacture the product for commercial sale. Harbutt travelled widely to promote the product, and his theories about the teaching of art by allowing children free expression. Personal life Harbutt was also a councillor on Bath rural district council and Bathampton parish council. He was a member of Bath New Church Society which followed the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, He and Bessie had seven children, six of whom survived infancy and worked in the family business. The Harbutt company, owned and run by Harbutt's descendants, continued to manufacture Plasticine in Bathampton until 1983. Death He died of pneumonia while on a trip to New York City in 1921. Memorials The Paradise in Plasticine garden, a creation of journalist and presenter James May displayed at the 2009 Chelsea Flower Show included a bust of Harbutt sculpted by Jane McAdam Freud.Paradise in Plasticine His home town of North Shields attempted to commemorate his legacy, in 2009, by commissioning some street furniture to resemble plasticine shapes and colour, made out of concrete. Unfortunately these had to be removed shortly after installation due to complaints from the public, as the street furniture retained pools of water in the seats after rain rendering them unusable or the user getting wet. In addition they were not comfortable or practical and very problematic for elderly or infirm members of the public to get in to and up from. The 'plasticine' chairs were relocated throughout the region to less commercial areas including to the grounds of a local sixth form college, and repainted from the plain plasticine colours to various colour schemes and designs. These remain in place (if rarely used or occupied). Traditional metal street furniture replaced the 'plasticine' furniture in the town centre of his birthplace.

By the 1930s, K≈çnoike was unable to compete with larger banks tied to zaibatsu conglomerates, so it merged with the Sanjushi Bank and Yamaguchi Bank. It became the largest bank in Japan in terms of assets during the years prior to World War II. During the postwar era, Sanwa was a major financier of Japanese heavy industry as the central hub of the Sanwa Group keiretsu.

You spare all things, for they are yours, O Lord, you who love the living.‚Äù *John 5:17: My Father is always at his work, even to this very day; and I am also working. *Hebrews 1:3: He upholds all things by the word of his power Moreover, there are other relevant places in the doctrinal Christian literature, for example: *St. Augustine comments on John 5:17: Let us therefore believe that God works constantly, so that all created things would perish, if his working were withdrawn. *The Catechism of the Catholic Church says in 301: With creation, God does not abandon his creatures to themselves. He not only gives them being and existence, but also, and at every moment, upholds and sustains them in being, enables them to act and brings them to their final end. Recognizing this utter dependence with respect to the Creator is a source of wisdom and freedom, of joy and confidence: In Islam God is known as \\"The Sustainer\\" () within His 99 names. Sustenance is everything that can be benefited from. Sustenance can be divided into two parts, physical sustenance like food and spiritual sustenance with science and knowledge. Names of people with the name Abdul Razzaq also exist. The mentioned references in the Quran are: Hinduism The conception of Deity in a sustaining/conserving/preserving mode is also used in Hindu theology where the Godhead, or Trim≈´rti in Sanskrit, consists of Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver/Sustainer, and Siva the Destroyer. Pantheism and pandeism In pantheism and pandeism (pantheistic deism) generally, God or some similar formulation is characterized as only needing to exist as a sustaining force, with no other aspect.

() is a 2006 third-person action video game by American McGee. Players assume the role of Anthony Willams, a former Hollywood agent turned homeless man in Los Angeles. During this time LA is ravaged by both natural and man-made disasters. Anthony only wishes to save himself, though through the course of the story he becomes an unwilling savior. The game's attempted tone is one of political satire, targeting all spectra of politics. While the game was set for world release on September 6, 2006, it first saw the light of day as part of the 9/2006 issue (released at the end of August 2006) of the Polish video game magazine CD-Action.CD-Action 09/2006: Bad Day L.A. na coverze - premiera! The game was released to mostly negative reviews, with reviewers criticizing its gameplay, visuals, voice acting, characters, offensive and crass humor, and poor attempts at satire. Development Bad Day L.A. was first announced for the Xbox and PC by developer Enlight Software on April 28, 2005. Inspiration for the game came from American McGee being in traffic seeing a Sunset Boulevard billboard from the Department of Homeland Security about preparations for Biochemical terrorism. Calling it \\"the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back\\", McGee decided to make a video game as a way to inject the message of having nothing to fear but fear itself. To offset the violent events happening in Bad Day L.A., the art duo Kozyndan was hired to make the art style have a humorous nature. The Xbox version of Bad Day L.A. was planned to be distributed by the London-based Supersonic Group, but was never released. A graphic novel based on the game and other American McGee games American McGee's Alice and American McGee's Grimm. The game was shown at E3 2005. Originally planned for an early 2006 release, on August 22, 2006, Aspyr Media announced that the game had gone gold and would be released on August 28. A demo for the game was available from MTV's website. Reception The game received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. GameSpot gave it a 3 out of 10, and called it \\"an abject failure\\" and a \\"spectacular failure in almost every facet of its execution\\". IGN gave it a 2.7, saying that \\"it's terrible\\". G4's X-Play gave it their lowest rating, a 1 out of 5, and also gave it a \\"Golden Mullet Award\\" for the year of 2006. PC Gamer gave it a 20%, saying it was \\"so tasteless that I wanted to scrub myself with Lysol after getting up from the computer\\" and \\"being a bad Postal clone\\". GameSpy \\"awarded\\" the title the \\"Coaster of the Year\\" award for 2006. GamesRadar awarded it the \\"collateral damage\\" award for the Anti-Game Of The Year claiming that it seemed to be \\"designed to end up on this list. If so... congratulations, guys, you did it!\\" But the game lost the award to Sonic The Hedgehog as that was apparently \\"the most disappointing\\" rather than \\"the absolute worst game of the year.\\" Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation briefly described it as \\"fondly remembered alongside botched prostate surgery.\\" GamesRadar ranked it as the 25th worst game ever made.Worst games Rolling Stone's Glixel also called it one of the worst games ever made. Mikel Reparaz from GamesRadar placed it on his list of \\"Unfunny games\\", noting the comedic timing being off, poorly direct visual gags, and overall horrible voice acting.

Development The tongue starts to develop at about 4 weeks. The tongue originates from the first, second, and third pharyngeal arches which induces the migration of muscles from the occipital myotomes. A U-shaped sulcus develops in front of and on both sides of the oral part of the tongue. This allows the tongue to be free and highly mobile, except at the region of the lingual frenulum, where it remains attached. Disturbances during this stage cause tongue tie or ankyloglossia. During the sixth week of gestation, the medial nasal processes approach each other to form a single globular process that in time gives rise to the nasal tip, columella, prolabium, frenulum of the upper lip, and the primary palate. As the tongue continues to develop, frenulum cells undergo apoptosis, retracting away from the tip of the tongue, and increasing the tongue's mobility. During early gestation (as early as 4 weeks) the lingual frenulum serves as a guide for the forward growth of the tongue. After birth the tip of the tongue continues to elongate, giving the impression of the frenulum retracting, though in reality this has been going on for some time before birth. This is what gives the impression that the frenulums of some previously tongue-tied infants will \\"stretch\\" with age and growth. In reality the tongue often just grows beyond the frenulum, although some do also stretch and/or rupture after mild accidents. Many others continue to cause problems throughout life, unless corrected. Anatomy The thin strip of tissue that runs vertically from the floor of the mouth to the undersurface of the tongue is called the lingual frenulum. It tends to limit the movement of the tongue, and in some people, it is so short that it actually interferes with speaking. The base of the frenulum contains a \\"V\\" shaped hump of tissue in the floor of the mouth which houses a series of saliva gland ducts. The two largest ducts are in the center just in front of the attachment of the lingual frenulum and are called Wharton's Ducts. They empty the submandibular (submaxillary) and sublingual salivary glands into a small prominence on either side of the frenulum, the sublingual caruncle. These ducts can be quite active in some persons, and upon occasion, a considerable amount of saliva may erupt from them while talking, eating, yawning, or cleaning the teeth in a process known as gleeking. The sublingual saliva glands empty through a series of tiny ducts in the tissue on either side of Wharton's ducts. The tongue is attached to the floor of the oral cavity by the frenulum. Sketch of an open mouth showing the frenulum & surrounding structures Superficial veins run through the base of the frenulum known as varicosities. Their presence is normal, becoming more and more prominent as one ages.http://www.doctorspiller.com/oral%20anatomy.htm Disorders Ankyloglossia Ankyloglossia, also known as tongue-tie, is a congenital anomaly characterised by an abnormally short lingual frenulum; when severe, the tip of the tongue cannot be protruded beyond the lower incisor teeth. Additionally, an abnormally short frenulum in infants can be a cause of breastfeeding problems, including sore and damaged nipples and inadequate feedings. The resultant trouble breastfeeding results in slower weight gain in affected infants. The absence of the inferior labial (100% sensitivity; 99.4% specificity) and lingual frenulum (71.4% sensitivity; 100% specificity) was found to be associated with classical and hypermobility types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. =Trauma related to oral sexual activity= Traumatic lesions on the ventral surface (undersurface) of the tongue, especially the lingual frenulum, can be caused by friction between the tongue and the mandibular central incisor teeth during cunnilingus and other oral sexual activities (such as anilingus) in what is sometimes known as cunnilingus tongue or cunnilingus syndrome. The condition manifests as pain and soreness on the undersurface of the tongue, and sometimes the throat. The ulceration of the lingual frenum caused by cunnilingus is typically oriented horizontally, the lesion corresponding to the contact of the ventral tongue with the incisal edge of the mandibular incisor teeth when the tongue is in its most forward position and the lingual frenulum is stretched. The ulceration has a nonspecific appearance, and is covered with a fibrinous exudate and surrounded by an erythematous (red) \\"halo\\". Chronic ulceration at this site can cause linear fibrous hyperplasia (irritation fibroma). Differential diagnosis is with other causes of oral ulceration such as aphthous stomatitis, secondary herpetic lesions, syphilis, etc. Topical anesthetic may be used to relieve symptoms while the lesion heals. Fibrous lesions may require surgical excision. The incisal edges of the mandibular teeth can be smoothed to minimize the chance of trauma. This type of lesion usually resolves in 7‚Äì10 days, but may recur with repeated performances.

The novel was first published in 1995 by Voyager Books (UK) and HarperPrism (US). It is the first book in the Ultimate Dragon Saga trilogy, and its sequels are Dragonstorm and Dragonflame. Dragoncharm is written entirely from the point of view of a range of dragon characters as they struggle to survive in a world that is rejecting magic. Much like the animal characters in Richard Adams's Watership Down and William Horwood's Duncton Wood, the dragons are anthropomorphised, displaying a large array of human characteristics, relationships and emotions. In 1995, the British Fantasy Society nominated Dragoncharm for Best Novel of the year. Plot introduction The novel is populated by two species of dragons: *Charmed dragons are of an older, magical order and have four legs as well as wings. However, due to their proficiency with magic, wings are not needed to fly and thus these limbs take on a more decorative role. They also use magic to breathe fire and change their bodies at will. *Natural dragons use no magic, and have just four limbs, using their forelimbs to fly rather like bats, or wyverns. Many Natural dragons show fear and hatred of the Charmed, and around the time of the events of the novel, they greatly outnumber the older, dying race. Plot summary The story begins with the destruction of the dragon settlement, South Point, home to Fortune, a young Natural dragon. Fleeing, he joins with the Charmed dragon Cumber on a desperate quest to reach the fabled citadel of the Charmed at Covamere. As they journey, the two dragons witness the growing conflict between the Charmed and the Naturals, which threatens to culminate in all-out war between the two species. They encounter signs everywhere that magic is leaving the world: trolls lie dying beneath the landscape, giants build enigmatic stone circles and faeries are evolving into proto-humans. The two dragon armies come together. Leading the Naturals is an insane dragon named Shatter, while the Charmed commander is a military monster called Wraith. Wraith's ambition is to breach the Maze of Covamere, at the very centre of which lies the ultimate power of the Seed of Charm. Fortune and Cumber, along with a growing band of companions from both races (including Gossamer, Brace, Scoff, Velvet, and others), thread their way through the conflict, seeking a way to unite both dragon species to face the greater threat that faces them all: the world is turning its back on magic and all dragons are facing extinction. When Fortune finally faces Wraith inside the Maze of Covamere, both dragons learn a dark secret from their shared past. When the ancient, immortal basilisk Ocher enters the fray, even Fortune is tempted by the power offered by the Seed of Charm. Dragoncharm ends in the aftermath of the turning of the world, the very moment when magic departs, leaving in its wake the natural world we humans know today. The story, following the lives of the surviving dragons, is picked up in Dragonstorm. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations Dragoncharm was optioned for a movie in 1996 by UK production group Dandelion Distributions. It was to be directed by Bob Keen and followed by a TV series of thirteen episodes. The adaptation would have been a mix of CGI and animatronics, using real locations as backgrounds. However nothing came of the plans and the rights are once again the author's property.

The loch was created by glacial processes and is in total around 15 miles (25 km) long. It has two sections: Upper Loch Torridon to landward, east of Rubha na h-Airde Ghlaise, at which point it joins Loch Sheildaig; and the main western section of Loch Torridon proper. Loch a' Chracaich and Loch Beag are small inlets on the southern shores of the outer Loch, which joins the Inner Sound between the headlands of Rubha na Fearna to the south and Red Point to the north. The name Thoirbhearta has a similar root to Tarbert and indicates a place where boats were dragged overland. Islands The islets in the loch include: * in Loch Shieldaig: Eilean an Inbhire Bh√†in, Eilean D√πghaill and Shieldaig Island. * in Upper Loch Torridon: Eilean √† Chaoil, Eilean Cnapach, both of which are tidal. * in outer Loch Torridon: Eilean M√≤r, Eilean Tioram, Sgeir Ghlas, Sgeir na Trian. Shieldaig Island has been owned by the National Trust for Scotland since 1970. It has a coverage of Scots Pine, which may have grown from seeds taken from Speyside in the mid-19th century. Surrounding villages Loch Torridon as seen from Torridon village Torridon village lies at the head of the loch and is surrounded by the spectacular Torridon Hills. To the north are the villages of Redpoint, Diabaig, Wester Alligin and Alligin Shuas. To the south is Shieldaig. Hills The view north west from the summit of An Ruadh-stac takes in Beinn Damh, Upper Loch Torridon and Beinn Alligin. The loch is surrounded by various mountains to the north, including Liathach, Beinn Alligin and Beinn Eighe, all of which are over in height. The Torridon Hills exhibit dramatic mountain scenery. The rocks of which they are made are known as Torridonian sandstone, some of which are crowned by white Cambrian quartzite. They are amongst the oldest rocks in Britain, and sit on yet older rocks, Lewisian gneiss. Fishing Loch Torridon, 1881 clipper Sails of ship Loch Torridon, 1881 Loch Torridon is an important prawn and shellfish fishery and is home to several salmon farms and industrial mussel production. Langoustines are fished by creels baited with herring or prawns, which are deployed on lines of up to 120 creels and left on the seabed for at least a day. Most of the catch is exported to Spain, but some is sold locally. The sustainable seafood certificate for Loch Torridon langoustines was suspended by the Marine Stewardship Council on 11 January 2011, due to increased fishing pressure in the area caused by creel-fishing boats that had not signed-up to the fishery's voluntary code of conduct.

He was much better known as El Gallo Rivera or Tonito Rivera, and was a prominent boxer during the decade of the 1980s. Professional career Jos√© Antonio Rivera began his professional boxing career on February 26, 1981, after a long and successful amateur boxing career, knocking out Humberto Maldonado in the first round at Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico. He posted two more wins in a row, one by knockout, then lost for the first time as a professional, beaten by Herminio Adorno by a decision in five rounds on May 22. Rivera avenged that loss with a first-round knockout of Adorno on July 9, in Trujillo Alto. Rivera won five of his next six bouts before fighting abroad for the first time, losing by a ten-round decision to Enrique Sanchez by a ten-round decision at Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, on October 15, 1982. About one year and a half later, Sanchez lost to Alberto Davila for the WBC world Bantamweight title. On February 12, 1983, Rivera fought for his first championship, the regional, Puerto Rican Super Bantamweight title. He conquered the belt by beating Orlando Perez by a twelve-round decision in Canovanas. Rivera won his next four fights, including a seventh-round knockout victory over Manuel Santos as part of the Wilfredo G√≥mez-Eladio Santana fight's undercard at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum on December 14 of that year, and his Madison Square Garden debut, a win over Vincent Christian by a fifth-round knockout on July 26, 1984, at the Garden's Felt Forum Arena. In his next fight, Rivera defended his Puerto Rican Super Bantamweight title against fellow Puerto Rican Juan Veloz, on September 1 in Carolina. The bout was a long awaited fight by Puerto Rican fight fans and press alike; ahead on points after ten rounds, Rivera lost the fight by a knockout in round eleven. On February 2, 1985, Rivera re-established himself as a top ranked boxer when he knocked out Alberto Mercado in seven rounds as part of one of Victor Callejas' title defense undercards. At stake in that bout was a spot among the IBF's top ten challengers. This time, it was Rivera who staged a comeback, being behind on the judges' scorecards before defeating Mercado. On July 12, he met Tony Miller in Australia, and the two boxers fought to a ten-round draw (tie). On October 5, he beat fringe contender Irving Mitchell in San Juan by a knockout in five rounds to win the WBC continental Americas Featherweight title and position himself as the number one challenger among Featherweights with the IBF. Rivera next faced a relatively long layoff, while negotiations over contracts for his world title challenge were finalized. Rivera finally got his first shot at becoming world champion on August 30, 1986, in Osan, South Korea, when he faced the IBF world Featherweight champion, Ki-Young Chung. Rivera became world champion by knocking Chung out in ten rounds. Rivera next faced another long layoff. When his first defense could be finally held. Rivera lost his title when he was knocked out in four rounds by Calvin Grove, on January 23, 1988 in Gamaches, France. Sixteen months passed between the moment that Rivera won the world championship and his first title defense. Tonito Rivera won his next three bouts before receiving a shot at becoming world champion again. On December 9, 1989, he dropped Kamel Bou Ali, but lost the fight by an eighth-round knockout, in Teramo, Italy. That bout was contested for the WBO's vacant world Jr. Lightweight title. Rivera, much like Marvin Hagler before him, fell in love with Italy. He lived there for the rest of his life, returning to Puerto Rico multiple times for fights. He lost his next fight after the bout with Bou Ali, but rebounded with four straight wins, including a third-round knockout over future world champion Giovanni Parisi on November 10, 1990 in Monsano. On September 14, 1991, Rivera challenged Dingaan Thobela for the WBO world Lightweight title, losing a twelve-round decision to Thobela in Johannesburg, South Africa. After winning four more bouts and drawing one, Rivera received another world title shot, this time in a rematch with Parisi, by then the WBO world Lightweight champion, in Rome on September 24, 1993. Rivera was outpointed by Parisi over twelve rounds. Rivera then embarked on another winning streak, which included a second-round knockout over Argentine hopeful Fabian Tejada on March 6, 1995, in Inglewood, California. That same year, on December 15, he returned to the Madison Square Garden to defeat Gerard Gray by a ninth-round knockout. Rivera would get another world title chance after that bout: on April 13, 1996, he lost to Artur Grigorian by a knockout in round twelve at Hamburg, Germany, for the WBO's world Lightweight title. Rivera won one, lost three and drew one of his next five fights. One of those bouts was a first-round knockout loss to fringe contender Shannan Taylor of Australia. He also lost to Diosbelys Hurtado, but, on October 25, 1997, he did draw over ten rounds with former WBO world Jr. Welterweight champion, fellow Puerto Rican Sammy Fuentes. Soon after defeating Johnny Valentin by a first-round knockout on September 30, 2002 in Hatillo, Puerto Rico, as part of a tournament named the world television Hispanic tournament, Rivera was diagnosed with an undisclosed disease, having to retire from boxing for good. Death After a long battle with his disease, he died on April 4, 2005 of an asthma attack. After death, Rivera made Puerto Rican sports history, becoming the first athlete to have his mortal remains exposed at the Puerto Rican Sports Pavilion. The second athlete to have his mortal remains exposed there was F√©lix Javier P√©rez, a basketball player who was murdered later that year while trying to defend a neighbor from robbers. Antonio Rivera had a professional boxing record of 36 wins, 13 losses and 3 draws, with 32 wins by knockout.

It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 9 March 1927, the same day it went into effect.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 60, pp. 254‚Äì270. The objective of the convention was to confirm and advance the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. Background In the Brussels Conference Act of 1890 the signatories \\"declared that they were equally animated by the firm intention of putting an end to the traffic in African slaves.\\" The Brussels Act was supplemented and revised by the Convention of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed by the Allied Powers of the First World War on 10 September 1919,United States of America - Convention revising the General Act of Berlin, 26 February 1885, and of the General Act and the Declaration of Brussels, 2 July 1890, signed at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 10 September 1919 (1922) LNTSer 19; 8 LNTS 27 in which the signatories undertook to \\"endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms and of the slave trade by land and sea.\\" (Art.11) A Temporary Slavery Commission was appointed by the Council of the League of Nations in June 1924. The commission was mixed in composition including former colonial governors, as well as a Haitian, and a representative from the International Labour Organization, Frederick Lugard, was the British representative on the commission. Significance The 1926 Slavery Convention established concrete rules and articles to advance the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. Slavery was defined (Art.1) as: > the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers > attaching to the right of ownership are exercised and the slave trade was defined as including: > all acts involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with > intent to reduce him to slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a > slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale > or exchange of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, > in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.  Contents (summarised)  > Article 2 > The parties agreed to prevent and suppress the slave trade and to > progressively bring about the complete elimination of slavery in all its > forms. Article 6 > The parties undertook to promulgate severe penalties for slave trading, > slaveholding, and enslavement.

It was first flown in December 2001 by Millennium Jet Inc, a private company run by Michael Moshier. Millennium Jet subsequently changed its name to Trek Aerospace Inc. The SoloTrek pilot maintained a standing position and was propelled by two ducted fans located above and on either side of the user, leading some to class it as a type of backpack helicopter. It ran for around 2 hours on gasoline fuel. According to Michael Moshier, its inventor and designer, SoloTrek was capable of hovering for up to two hours, flying at 100 km/h and travelling more than 200 km.(New Scientist August 26, 2000) One such model is featured in the movie Agent Cody Banks, though it is shown to be 'flying' only by the use of special effects. Early renderings of the SoloTrek were produced by Marc Ericksen, a Silicon Valley commercial artist and illustrator. Michael Moshier had commissioned Mark Ericksen to produce these renderings to help the company raise funding for the aircraft's development. Subsequently, the company was successful in receiving over $5 million of development funding from DARPA. SoloTrek remains an extremely unusual design; to apply the name 'jet pack' is incorrect; the pilot was strapped into the exoskeleton frame which took the weight of the machine whilst landed, though it performed the same aim. In numerous trials at Trek Aerospace's facilities in Sunnyvale, California, the machine \\"appeared to perform perfectly\\".(New Scientist #2519) During early flights, for safety reasons, the SoloTrek was 'tethered' to a crane during test flights, to prevent uncontrolled ascent or travel. The tethers were designed to retract during lift-off to avoid being sucked into the exposed ducted fans at the top of the machine, but during a flight shortly after a rain shower in December 2002, the tether failed to retract and became tangled in the propeller blades, which disintegrated. Pilot and machine dropped to the ground. The pilot walked away unharmed. Unable to stick to the tight development schedule that its backers demanded, Trek Aerospace lost funding, forcing reorganization in 2003. After reorganization, Trek Aerospace extensively redesigned the aircraft, creating the Springtail EFV. This machine first flew in October 2003, and went on to successfully complete its DARPA contract in 2005. Trek Aerospace continues to develop ducted fan vehicles. The original SoloTrek XFV is on display at the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California.

To remove sebum from hair, some apply a surfactant, usually shampoo (sometimes soap) to their hair and lather the surfactant with water. The surfactant is rinsed out with water along with the dirt that it bonds to. There are dry shampoos; powders which remove sebum from hair by soaking it up prior to being combed out. Hairdressing Most hairdressers in Canada, US and Europe and Latin America, offer hair wash as a service before or after a hair cut. This is usually done to make hair more manageable for the hairdresser performing the hair cut. After a hair cut, it can remove loose strands of hair. It is also a relaxing practice, and many clients enjoy a hair wash as part of a hair cut. Hairdressers use specialized basins to perform a hair wash; these can be either forward or backward style. In the backward version (the more common), the client sits in a chair, and leans their head back into a sink, with the hairdresser standing behind them. In the forward version, the client leans forward over a sink, and the hairdresser stands over them to wash their hair. In some parts of the world, such as China, it is not uncommon to see what is referred to as an 'upright' shampoo. In this style, the client sits in a chair, while a hairdresser applies shampoo to their hair and adds water. They then rinse off into a basin.

The ELROB is not a competition, like the US DARPA Grand Challenge, but a pure demonstration of what European robotics is able to achieve today. The scenarios are designed to simulate real world missions, be it military or civilian ones. There are no artificial constraints set to this scenarios to ease the task for the robots like e.g. very visible road markings. This forces the participating teams and systems to fulfil high requirements set by the real world scenarios. The first ELROB in 2006 was organized by the German Federal Armed Forces and took place on the infantry training area near Hammelburg, 15‚Äì18 May 2006. The goal of the first trial was to boost the development of unmanned ground vehicles that could be used in military missions on short notice. The ELROB is an annual event and alternates between a military and a civilian focus each year. European Robotics and the NATO Research Task Group \\"Military Applications for Multi-Robot Systems\\" came up with the idea for ELROB in the year 2004. European Robotics aims to bridge the gap between defence and security (D&S;) users, industry and research in the field of ground robotics. The ELROB is a good opportunity to follow these goals. Because ELROB is meant to be a European trial, only teams from Europe are allowed. But both teams of commercial and academic backgrounds are allowed.  Civilian ELROB  The civilian ELROB (short C-ELROB) takes place every two years alternating with the military version. It was initiated to allow teams, which are not interested in military missions or cooperation, to attend ELROB, too. Sadly, until today, there is no team that takes part only on the C-ELROB. On the other hand, of course, the defence companies are not that interested in the civilian ELROB. Therefore, the number of teams on C-ELROB is a bit lower than on M-ELROB and organisation is a bit less strict. Most teams do not see C-ELROB as competition or as demonstration, but as possibility to prove their own systems in a challenging field test and new surroundings. It is a great opportunity to learn new things about their robot systems and find new approaches. ELROB is explicitly designed to shape the direction of R&D; for the short and medium term and aims to fertilize the co-operation between research and SMEs. From 2013 till 2015, instead of C-ELROB the newly created EURATHLON trial will take place, a robot competition supported by the European Commission in the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7). = Scenarios = In general the scenarios should be mastered with maximum autonomy, although teleoperation is allowed. The location for the scenario is kept secret until short before the start of the trials and therefore the teams have no chance to generate a detailed map of the area (for example with laser range finders) ahead of their run. The location is described to the participants by GPS coordinates and aerial imagery.  Reconnaissance and Surveillance  The task in the \\"Reconnaissance and Surveillance\\" setting is to reach a given area and explore it. During the exploration special points of interest (normally marked) need to be detected and localized. The position of this points and a photograph should be given to the judges as results of the run. If possible, the robot should return to its starting position, when it finished exploring.  Autonomous Navigation  The aim of the \\"Autonomous Navigation\\" scenario is to follow a given route mostly autonomous. The route will be some kilometers in length. During the traversal of the route points of interest (usually marked) need to be found and localised. Again the position and a photograph of the points of interest need to be given to the judges as results of the run.  Camp Security  The \\"Camp Security\\" scenario requires the robots to guard a predefined area for the time of the scenario run. During the run (marked) intruders will be entering the area and need to be detected, tracked and pursued. An image of the intruder and its location while it was captured need to be given to the judges as result. Capturing means \\"drive near the intruder and stop\\", then the captured intruder will leave the area.  Transport Mule  The \\"Transport Mule\\" scenario simulates a shuttle service. The robot should install a shuttle service between two given points as autonomously as possible and shuttle between those points as often as possible during the time of its scenario run. = Past civilian ELROBs =  2007  ELROB 2007 Logo C-ELROB 2007 took place in Monte Ceneri, Swiss (Canton Ticino), 13‚Äì16 August. The area of the trials was part of the truck test track of the Swiss army which meant very difficult ground for the vehicles. With this ELROB the scenario \\"Autonomous Navigation\\" was integrated into ELROB for the first time. It was created on public demand to allow bigger vehicles to better show their abilities. Therefore, the track length of \\"Autonomous Navigation\\" was several kilometres. Additionally, there were three versions of the \\"Reconnaissance and Surveillance\\" setting. The first was in urban area which included intrusion of buildings. The second was placed in non urban area with higher requirements on the off-road mobility of the vehicles and the third one concentrated on the combination of UGVs and UAVs. All scenario run times were limited to 45 minutes. The result of C-ELROB 2007 was, that there are some semi-autonomous assistance functions ready. Most vehicles managed to drive in difficult outdoor terrain, too. But some of the teams were surprised by reality and had severe problems with radio communication and battery power. There were 14 participating teams in total. Nine of the teams came from Germany, two from Poland and one from Finland, Swiss and Portugal, respectively.  2009  ELROB 2009 Logo The C-ELROB 2009 took place in Oulu, Finland, 15‚Äì17 June. The area of the trials was a former zoo and a part of a public forest near the University of Oulu. The scenarios were very similar to the ones on the military ELROB 2008. This was due to public demand of the participants who requested more continuity in the scenarios to have the chance to catch up with the requirements of a scenario and not be confronted with different scenarios and requirements each year. Therefore, there were the \\"Reconnaissance and Surveillance\\", \\"Autonomous Navigation\\", \\"Camp Security\\" and \\"Transport Mule\\" scenarios. Additionally, all points of interest and the intruders in the \\"Camp Security\\" scenario were marked with ERICards, because computer vision was no focus of the trials. The run time of the scenarios was limited to 60 minutes. ELROB 2009 was attended by ten teams. Seven teams came from Germany and one from France, Poland and Finland, each.  Military ELROB  The military ELROB (short M-ELROB) has a sharp focus on short-term realisable systems which are able to fulfil the requirements of common military tasks. Therefore, the scenarios simulate real world missions as close as possible which is reflected by the fact that members of the Bundeswehr are part of the organisation committee. The organisers do not place artificial constraints on the scenarios regardless of the abilities of the robots. One example was the very bad radio communication encountered during M-ELROB 2008, because most trials took place in the forest. M-ELROB is explicitly designed to assess current technology to solve real world problems at hand. M-ELROB is a tool to bring together users, researchers and industry. = Scenarios = The scenarios of the M-ELROBs correspond to real military situations like Reconnaissance and Surveillance missions. In general the scenarios should be mastered with maximum autonomy, although teleoperation is allowed. The location for the scenario is kept secret until short before the start of the trials and therefore the teams have no chance to generate a detailed map of the area (for example with laser range finders) ahead of their run.

During the run (marked) intruders will be entering the area and need to be detected, tracked and pursued. An image of the intruder and its location while it was captured need to be given to the judges as result. Capturing means \\"drive near the intruder and stop\\", then the captured intruder will leave the area.  Transport Convoy  The \\"Transport Convoy\\" mission requests at least two vehicles to be navigated, as fast as possible, to a target position which is several kilometres away. A payload of about 50 kg needs to be transported. At most one of the vehicles may be controlled by human, which may reduce the task for the robot to autonomously follow a vehicle. Of course two (or more) completely autonomously vehicles are better.  Transport Mule  The \\"Transport Mule\\" scenario simulates a shuttle service. The robot should install a shuttle service between two given points as autonomously as possible and shuttle between those points as often as possible during the time of its scenario run. = Past military ELROBs =  2006  ELROB 2006 Logo The M-ELROB 2006 took place in Hammelburg on the training area of the infantry school of the German Forces, 15‚Äì18 May. M-ELROB 2006 was the first ELROB and was utilized to paint a picture of the possibilities of modern robotics. The scenarios were concentrated on navigation. One was located in urban terrain which includes intrusion into buildings. The other scenario took place outdoors on a more challenging ground with mud and very steep slopes. Both scenarios fall into the category \\"Reconnaissance and Surveillance\\", although there were no points of interest that needed to be found. The time limit was 30 minutes. The result of M-ELROB 2006 was disillusioning. Most of the teams had to fight hardware failures and all were remote controlled via WLAN. All in all 18 teams were participating, eleven German teams, three from the UK, two from Swiss and one from Portugal and France, each.  2008  Again, the M-ELROB 2008 took place in Hammelburg on the training area of the infantry school of the German Forces form 30 June till 3 July. But it took place on a different part of the training area which was more challenging and hindered radio communication because of the dense forest. The scenarios were much more manifold than in 2006 and 2007. There were \\"Reconnaissance and Surveillance\\", \\"Autonomous Navigation\\", \\"Transport Convoy\\", \\"Transport Mule\\" and \\"Camp Security\\". This scenarios required very diverse abilities from the robot systems. Additionally one special session of the \\"Reconnaissance and Surveillance\\" scenario took place at night time, so vision systems were unusable. The run time limit was 60 minutes for a scenario run. The results of ELROB 2008 showed that remote controlled UGVs are more or less ready for deployment, but the radio communication places severe constraints on the usability of such systems. With semi autonomous assistance functions, like e.g. waypoint navigation, the robot system is much more useful while encountering bad radio communication. M-ELROB 2008 was attended by 17 teams. Eleven from Germany, two from the UK and one from Italy, the Netherlands, France and Finland, respectively.  2010  The military ELROB 2010 took place from June 17 to 20 2010 on the army training area near Hammelburg in Germany. = Next military ELROB =  2012  The military ELROB 2012 took place from September 24 to 28 2012 on the training area of the Swiss Army near Thun in Switzerland.

He was named after his grandfather, Yekutiel Ravayev, who was killed in combat defending Petah Tikva from Arabs in 1916.http://www.izkor.gov.il/HalalKorot.aspx?id=506444 His family were Mountain Jews from the Caucasus region. At the age of 15, Yekutiel joined the Haganah. At 20, he became a commander. On May 1, 1948, he was one of the commanders who captured the Palestinian village Salame, to the south of Tel Aviv. He later joined an elite Haganah unit that conducted raids into enemy territory. In March, 1950, Adam married and built a house in Tel Aviv. At that time, he became an officer in the IDF, with the rank of lieutenant. Adam rose quickly through the ranks. In 1952, he became a captain in the Givati Brigade. Then he went on to command the Be'er Sheva bloc as a lieutenant colonel. He went on to study in the war academy in France in 1964-66 and returned to assume the rank of colonel. In the Six-Day War, he served under Ariel Sharon, proving his worth. Following the war, he became commander of the Golani Brigade. The Golani Brigade was responsible for keeping the peace in the north during the War of Attrition. During this time, Adam was promoted to brigadier general and served as the vice commander of the IDF's Northern Command until the end of the Yom Kippur War. In 1974, Adam was moved to the Sinai where he became a major general and eventually went on to head the Southern Command. He was the commander of the Operation Entebbe, the 1976 raid at Entebbe airport in Uganda. In 1978, he went to the United States to study and returned to become the Deputy Chief of Staff, under Rafael Eitan, and head of the Directorate of Operations. In 1982, Adam went to the United States again to study, this time in Berkeley, but came back to Israel after Prime Minister Menachem Begin announced Adam's appointment to as head of the Mossad, in replacement of Yitzhak Hofi. He was killed in the 1982 Lebanon War before he could take up his post. On June 10 of that year, the fourth day of the war, Adam and a group of Israeli officers were commanding operations from an appropriated villa in Dawha near the town of Damour some 12 kilometers south of Beirut. When the area was shelled by enemy mortars, Adam and two other officers descended to the basement to take cover. A Lebanese fighter (Amal Movemet), who was hiding there, opened fire killing Adam and fatally wounding Col. Chaim Sela. Yekutiel Adam was deputy Chief of Staff and thus the highest ranking IDF officer ever to be killed in battle. The identity of Adam's killer was never clarified. Some sources identify him as a Palestinian minor.Meir Kahane, Uncomfortable questions for comfortable Jews, 1987, p. 99 An IDF medic who served in an Israeli military prison during the war witnessed an officer point to a 15-year-old boy among a group of prisoners and said: \\"You see this boy? He murdered the late Yekutiel Adam\\".Amia Lieblich, Transition to Adulthood During Military Service: The Israeli Case, 1989, State University of New York, p. 35 Yekutiel Adam was buried in Kiryat Shaul cemetery, Tel Aviv. A street was named after him in Ashkelon, and a main road in North Jerusalem. The Israeli Institute of Technology has named the Adam Yekutiel soil-machine laboratory after him.

It covers an area of 200 km¬≤ and lies 62 km from Lugo. As of 2017 it had a population of 18,783 . Location Map. Monforte de Lemos is located in a valley between the rivers Minho and Sil. The river Cabe, a tributary of Sil, runs through the city. It is the core of the region known as Terra de Lemos and capital of the area known as Ribeira Sacra or Terras de Lemos. Symbols The coat of arms of Monforte de Lemos was approved after the mandatory report of the Heraldic Council of Galicia, the autonomous government, under Decree 166/2002 of April 25, 2002. The process sparked some initial controversy by contemplating the withdrawal of the Tau of Gules, a heraldic device associated, among others, to the Order of St. Anthony and St. Anton. It was traditionally used as an emblem of the town, finally being emblazoned, in response to this feature together with its historical strength and its relationship with the House of Lemos, as follows: > Of Silver, a mountain of gold, added to the tower of the same, accompanied > in the center of the head of a Tau of Gules and six azure bezants, on the > flanks. At the ring, royal crown closed  History  =Paleolithic to the Romans= The area around the town has been inhabited since long before the Roman occupation, as testified by excavations of sites dating to the Bronze Age. The history of Monforte de Lemos goes back to the Paleolithic, and its first known inhabitants were the Oestrimnios. This period was called the \\"castrexa\\" or the culture of the forts, typical of the Celtic tribes. The tribe that populated Monforte was known as the Lemavi tribe, and the first written references to them date from the Roman historians Pliny the Elder and Strabo, between 600 and 900 BC. The Lemavi were centered on the hill of San Vicente. The word \\"Lemos,\\" which also gives name to the region, known as Terra de Lemos, would be a voice of Celtic origin meaning \\"moist, fertile soil\\" and seems to connect with the root Galician word of \\"lama\\" or in English \\"slime.\\" It is believed that during pre- history, Monforte, now a valley, was a large lagoon, and evidence of this is found in the hard red clay by digging a few feet into the floor of the city. Likewise, its river, el Cabe, was already known for its ferrous properties and much appreciated at the time of tempering swords of Celtic warriors, who came from all corners to take comfort with its excellent properties. The settlement of the Lemavis was the Castro Dactonium, whose actual location has long been disputed, although early medieval sources point to its likely location on San Vicente do Pino, the main town which was the origin of today's Monforte. \\"Dactonium, quod dicitur pinus\\" (Dactonio, which they call Pine), one of the documents states which supports this version. The theory has been recently reinforced by the discovery of remains of Castra√±a houses on the slopes of the mountains. From the Romans, whose track has been demonstrated in the city, comes the word \\"Monforte\\", from the Latin \\"Mons-Fortis\\". Subsequently, the Suevi and the Visigoths left their own footprints. In the Swabian era, the lands of Lemos belonged largely to the Condado Pallarense (related to the place of Pallares in the civil parish of Baamorto). =Middle Ages to the Enlightenment= It is believed the town was destroyed in the 8th century by the Muslim invaders. In the 12th century, the Count of Galicia granted the city to Fruela D√≠az, of the House of Lemos, who had the town rebuilt over the ruins. Monforte thenceforth flourished as an agricultural market. During the Middle Ages, a Benedictine community established on the Monastery of San Vicente del Pino. Numerous monasteries were built around the city in that period, in the zone known as Ribeira Sacra (\\"Sacred Shore\\"), including the area between the shores of the Sil and Mi√±o rivers, where they also run through canyons. Both the capital tower and the fortified city's walls were demolished during the Irmandi√±o revolt in the second half of 15th century. The rebels repressed by the Count of Lemos, the lord of the land, who made them work to rebuild the castle. In 1883 the town was reached by a railroad, which helped Monforte to take place as a trade and communication center, due to its position as Galicia's entrance by train. During the Spanish Civil War, the republican mayor, Juan Tiz√≥n, escaped to Portugal, after trying to reorganize the resistance. His predecessor, major Rosendo Vila Fernandez, was killed by the rebels. In the next decades the rail station was partially dismantled, the communication center was moved to the city of Ourense, the train factories were removed, causing a period of economic depression. Tourism business is one of the currently expanding activities in Monforte. Main sights Nosa Se√±ora da Antiga's School, a monumental school and church in Herrerian style, is known as the \\"Galician Escorial\\". The square in front of it was known as Campo da Compa√±√≠a (\\"The Society Square\\") when the building was occupied by the Society of Jesus, which managed the school until their expulsion order from Spain, after which the Piarists took it over. Nosa Se√±ora da Antiga's School Inside the school's church is an altarpiece built by Francisco de Moure and finished by his son. Over the altarpiece is an empty piece of wood from which the Society of Jesus' symbol was erased, in order to clean every fingerprint they left on Spain. The school also houses a collection of pictures by artists such as El Greco and Andrea del Sarto. The monumental stair, featuring an apparent lack of physical support, is made from one marble piece, and supported on air by a game of strengths. The praying statue of Cardinal Rodrigo The Castro is placed over his grave, inside the church, and in front of an image of Nosa Se√±ora da Antiga; recent works have found that the grave of Cardinal Rodrigo's mother is hidden behind the picture.

The instant a crop is removed from the ground, or separated from its parent plant, it begins to deteriorate. Postharvest treatment largely determines final quality, whether a crop is sold for fresh consumption, or used as an ingredient in a processed food product. Goals Drying chili peppers. Milyanfan, Kyrgyzstan The most important goals of post-harvest handling are keeping the product cool, to avoid moisture loss and slow down undesirable chemical changes, and avoiding physical damage such as bruising, to delay spoilage. Sanitation is also an important factor, to reduce the possibility of pathogens that could be carried by fresh produce, for example, as residue from contaminated washing water. After the field, post-harvest processing is usually continued in a packing house. This can be a simple shed, providing shade and running water, or a large-scale, sophisticated, mechanised facility, with conveyor belts, automated sorting and packing stations, walk-in coolers and the like. In mechanised harvesting, processing may also begin as part of the actual harvest process, with initial cleaning and sorting performed by the harvesting machinery. Initial post-harvest storage conditions are critical to maintaining quality. Each crop has an optimum range of storage temperature and humidity. Also, certain crops cannot be effectively stored together, as unwanted chemical interactions can result. Various methods of high-speed cooling, and sophisticated refrigerated and atmosphere-controlled environments, are employed to prolong freshness, particularly in large-scale operations. Postharvest shelf life Once harvested, vegetables and fruits are subject to the active process of degradation. Numerous biochemical processes continuously change the original composition of the crop until it becomes unmarketable. The period during which consumption is considered acceptable is defined as the time of \\"postharvest shelf life\\". Postharvest shelf life is typically determined by objective methods that determine the overall appearance, taste, flavor, and texture of the commodity. These methods usually include a combination of sensorial, biochemical, mechanical, and colorimetric (optical) measurements. A recent study attempted (and failed) to discover a biochemical marker and fingerprint methods as indices for freshness. Post-harvest physiology Post-harvest physiology is the scientific study of the physiology of living plant tissues after picking. It has direct applications to postharvest handling in establishing the storage and transport conditions that best prolong shelf life. An example of the importance of the field to post-harvest handling is the discovery that ripening of fruit can be delayed, and thus their storage prolonged, by preventing fruit tissue respiration. This insight allowed scientists to bring to bear their knowledge of the fundamental principles and mechanisms of respiration, leading to post-harvest storage techniques such as cold storage, gaseous storage, and waxy skin coatings.

Family Dale was the only son of Dorset landowner James Dale of Glanvilles Wootton and his wife, Mary Kelloway Barton. Late in life, 28 December 1848, at Eltham Kent he married for the first time Lucy Marianne (1821-1875), eldest sister of Dr Henry Wylde.E. Walford, The county families of the United Kingdom, Robert Hardwick, London, 1860 She is reported to have accompanied him on some of his expeditions. They were to have two sons, Charles William Dale (1851-1906) best known as a lepidopterist and dipterist but he also published notes on other insects including coleoptera, and Edward Robert Dale (1853-1903) who described himself as an entomologist and electrical engineer when the use of electricity was still in its infancy.Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Great ..., Volume 1 Harrison, Pall Mall, London. 1894 Career Lulworth skipper Dale received his education at Wimborne Grammar School and Sidney Sussex College Cambridge University receiving his MA in 1818. He was a magistrate. On one occasion a cloud of butterflies was released into Dale's magistrate court. His most famous discovery was the Lulworth skipper.Michael A. Salmon, Peter Marren, Basil Harley, The Aurelian Legacy: British Butterflies and Their Collectors, University of California Press, 2000. He was a friend of James Francis Stephens, frequently mentioned in that author's Illustrations of British Entomology and of John Curtis who refers to him frequently in his British Entomology. Another close friend was the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday. The references are mainly to Coleoptera though Dale worked on all Orders. His first note, on Lepidoptera was published, in the Magazine of Natural History in 1830. This was followed by some 83 further notes and articles covering a wide range of topics. He was elected a member of the first Entomological Society of London on 25 June 1822. He was appointed High Sheriff of Dorset for 1843. Collections Dale‚Äôs collection is in the Hope Department of Entomology.The Dalean collection was housed in 33 cabinets when it was received at Oxford in 1906, of which five cabinets were devoted to Coleoptera. Included in the latter are four drawers of Thomas Vernon Wollaston beetles from Madeira, Cape Verde, Canary Islands and St. Helena. It is still housed separately from the main collections.

While Alexander was founding the new city of Alexandria Eschate on the Jaxartes river, news came that Spitamenes had roused Sogdiana against him and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in Maracanda. Too occupied at that time to personally lead an army against Spitamenes, Alexander sent an army under the command of Pharnuches which was promptly annihilated with a loss of no less than 2000 infantry and 300 cavalry. The uprising now posed a direct threat to his army, and Alexander moved personally to relieve Maracanda, only to learn that Spitamenes had left Sogdiana and was attacking Bactria, from where he was repulsed with great difficulty by the satrap of Bactria, Artabazos (328 BC). The decisive point came in December 328 BC when Spitamenes was defeated by Alexander's general Coenus at the Battle of Gabai. Spitamenes' wife killed him and sent his head to Alexander, suing for peace and effectively dissolving Spitamenes' army. Spitamenes had a daughter, Apama, who was married to one of Alexander's most important generals and an eventual Diadochi, Seleucus I Nicator (February 324 BC). The couple had a son, Antiochus I Soter, a future ruler of the Seleucid Empire. Several towns were named Apamea in her honour.

In 1657, the estate was owned by the Dutch East India Company which used it partly as a granary. Later, the farm and farmhouse was sold into private hands. Groote Schuur was later acquired by William De Smidt, and remained in the family's possession until it was sold by Abraham De Smidt, Surveyor General of the Cape Colony, in 1878, and was bought by Hester Anna van der Byl of the prominent Van Der Byl / Coetsee family.Martin Meredith, Diamonds Gold and War, (New York: Public Affairs, 2007):251 In 1891 Cecil Rhodes leased it from her. He later bought it from her in 1893 for ¬£60 000, and had it converted and refurbished by the architect Sir Herbert Baker. The Cape Dutch building, located in Rondebosch, on the slopes of Devil's Peak, the outlying shoulder of Table Mountain, was originally part of the Dutch East India Company's granary constructed in the seventeenth century. Little of the original house remained after a fire in 1896. The traditional thatched roof was replaced by sturdier Welsh slates. Rhodes gave no strict instructions as to what he wanted from Baker. Rhodes abhorred any mechanically made items (such as hinges for windows) in the house and set out to remove them and have them replaced with brass and bronze items that would be cast. Baker replaced the front of the house, added a long stoep in the back and constructed a new wing. The wing contained a billiard room and master bedroom above on the second floor that contained a large bay window overlooking Devil's Peak. He also added a grand hall with a massive fireplace.Meredith, 252 Sir Herbert Baker also played a significant role in the furnishing of the house. After initially furnishing with modern furniture from London, Rhodes, influenced by Baker, began a shift from the modern to more traditional Cape furniture. This would mark the beginning of Cecil Rhodes‚Äô collection of colonial furnishings. The gardens of the house were as Rhodes demanded 'masses of colour'. Surrounding the house was a mass of roses, hydrangeas, cannas, bougainvilleas and fuchsias. Farther away from the house on the slopes of Devil's Peak, Rhodes kept antelopes, zebra, eland, wildebeest and ostriches.Meredith, 253 Rhodes was always a generous host while at Groote Schuur. He used the residence as much as a business and political headquarters as a home. His life at the time was one of dinner parties and meetings on the stoep, where he would be joined by as many as fifty people.Meredith, 254 From 1910 to 1984, it was the official Cape residence of the Prime Ministers of South Africa and continued as a presidential residence of P. W. Botha and F. W. De Klerk. However, P.W. Botha never resided there, opting rather to live in Westbrooke. Armoria civica - Rondebosch In May 1956, Time magazine reported, \\"a party was held at Groote Schuur for South Africa's Nationalist Prime Minister Johannes Strydom after he had won the parliamentary campaign to continue white supremacy in a land of 2.6 million whites and 10 million nonwhites. The party was given by some of the younger nationalists and their wives to honor him. They organized a caravan of 130 vehicles and slowly drove up to the Groote Schuur. After reaching the house, they began to sing old Boer war songs‚Äîthe Volksliederen of the Transvaal and Orange Free State. A speech was given by Mrs. M.D.J. Koster, the only female member of the parliament, 'Every white woman and every white mother thanks you from the depth of her heart.'

The building was the site for the signing of the historic \\"Groote Schuur Minute\\" between Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress and F.W. De Klerk, the then President of South Africa, on 4 May 1990. The document was a commitment between the two parties towards the resolution of the existing climate of violence and intimidation as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations. A working party was established to investigate the granting of temporary immunity to ANC cadres, to advise on how to deal with the release of political prisoners and to make recommendations on the definition of political offences.

He was a staunch pro-French activist, and is famous for his quaint drawings, some of which contain harsh critiques of the Germans of the time. He was also a French hero of both the First and the Second World Wars.  Biography  = Early life = Jean-Jacques Waltz was born in Colmar the 23 February 1873, two years after the annexation of Alsace by the German Empire following the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1. He worked as an artist for the textile industry, and drew postcards and programmes for local events. He started publishing satirical works in 1908 under the pseudonym \\"Hansi\\", making particular fun of German tourists. = First satirical works and First World War = Hansi became famous with his polemical satiric work Professor Knatschke (1912), which became a best-seller in France, as well as several other militant works. He came to incarnate the symbol of pro-French Alsatians, especially among \\"revanchist\\" French intellectuals such as Maurice Barr√®s. Hansi was imprisoned several times by the German authorities for making fun of the German military and professors, culminating in a one-year sentence given by the tribunal of Leipzig in July 1914. This caused a national outrage in France, making headlines in newspapers and inspiring two editorials by Clemenceau. Hansi eventually escaped to France, where he joined the military as a translator-officer when the First World War broke out. = Late life = In 1940, Hansi, still wanted by the Gestapo for his militant works and his treason of 1914, had to flee into Vichy France. He was attacked by the Nazis in Agen, and fled to Switzerland. Badly wounded because of this attack, he remained weak until he died in 1951. = Legacy = Hansi is now archetypal of Alsace folklore. His original books, published in a few thousand copies, are valued among collectors. It is very common to find plates and every-day items decorated with his drawings. His books have been republished several times.

It was fought off Cape Passaro, in the southern tip of the island of Sicily of which Spain had occupied. Spain and Britain were at peace, but Britain was already committed to supporting the ambitions of the Emperor Charles VI in southern Italy. The battle was fought without a formal declaration of war but once the Spanish fired on the nearest British ships, this gave Byng his excuse to attack. The British were superior in numbers. The battle was the most significant naval action of the War of the Quadruple Alliance and resulted in a decisive victory for the British fleet, which captured or burned sixteen Spanish ships of line and frigates and several small vessels. Some of the Spanish ships were taken in the main action and some taken or burnt by their crews, who fled to the coast of Sicily. Both Casta√±eta and Chac√≥n were captured. As a result of the battle the Spanish army in Sicily were thus isolated and cut off from outside help. Four months later the War of the Quadruple Alliance was formally declared. Background Philip V of Spain around 1720. Oil on canvas by Miguel Jacinto Mel√©ndez in the Prado Museum. On 11 April, 1713, after the War of the Spanish Succession, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed between France and the Kingdom of Great Britain, the United Provinces, the Kingdom of Prussia, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Duchy of Savoy. It marked the end of the Spanish Empire in Europe, as the Spanish Netherlands, the Kingdom of Naples, the Duchy of Milan and Sardinia were ceded to Austria, the Kingdom of Sicily to Savoy, Gelderland to the Kingdom of Prussia, and Minorca and Gibraltar to Great Britain. France had succeeded in placing a king of her own royal house on a neighbouring throne, but the ambitions expressed in the wars of Louis XIV had been defeated and the European system based on the balance of power largely directed by Britain was preserved. Giulio Alberoni The British gains at the expense of the French and Spanish allowed it to strengthen her naval power. Gibraltar and Port Mahon in the Mediterranean and the colonies of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in North America proved useful to extend and protect British trade. In comparison, the Spanish navy was old and many of their ships needed refitting. Philip ordered more shipbuilding to commence in the American and Spanish shipyards. The major political figure Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, who had come from the Duchy of Parma proceeded to reorganise the royal administration. Alberoni had promised Philip to put Spain in a strong position to recover Sicily and Naples if there were five years of peace. Alberoni was even willing to help Philip V to overthrow the Regent of France, Philip of Orleans, and alienate that country in order to grant trade benefits to Britain with the aim of isolating Austria. The British monarch George I, who was also Elector of Hanover, felt threatened by Alberoni who thought he would undermine the power of Emperor Charles VI. Alberoni on hearing this withdrew all claims. This, together with Philip's claims over the French throne, turned Great Britain and France against Spain. Both countries, jointly with the United Provinces, had formed the so-called Triple Alliance a year before to maintain the balance of power in the continent. Meanwhile, both Austria and Spain were at loggerheads over Sicily. The British statesmen preferred the island to be ceded to their former ally rather than Spain. France, under the weakness of Philip of Orleans agreed, and it was proposed to modify the Treaty of Utrecht and force Victor Amadeus II of Savoy to exchange Sicily for Sardinia. The detention of the Spanish Grand Inquisitor Jos√© Molin√©s at Milan however by orders of the Emperor gave Spain a pretext to initiate military hostilities in Italy. Prelude On 22 July 1717, a large Spanish fleet set sail from Barcelona with an army led by the Flemish nobleman Lieutenant General Jean Fran√ßois de Bette, Marquis of Lede. This force then captured the island of Sardinia. At the same time negotiations had ensued between Austria, Spain, and France in order to avoid a war. The British and French envoys at the same time offered Philip V the Duchies of Parma and Tuscany, and also to renounce Charles VI's claim to the Spanish throne, if Philip abandoned Sicily and accepted Sardinia. In view of Alberoni's negatives, even Gibraltar was offered. The Cardinal was strengthening Spain's position in Europe by forming an alliance with Russia and Sweden, with the aim of restoring the House of Stuart to the British throne. =Byng sent to the Mediterranean= Portrait of Jos√© Pati√±o by Jean Ranc commander of the Spanish expedition In the early months of 1718 a large number of Royal Naval vessels began to be commissioned and refitted; this alarmed the Spanish ambassador, the Marquis of Monteleon. Admiral George Byng, a man of long experience, was appointed Commander-in- Chief of the Mediterranean on 24 March. He was, upon his arrival there to inform the King of Spain, the Viceroy of Naples (at that time Count Wirich Philipp von Daun) and the Governor of Milan (the Prince Maximilian Karl of L√∂wenstein‚ÄìWertheim), that he had been sent to settle the differences between Spain and Austria. Byng set sail from Spithead on 15 June with a fleet of twenty ships of line, two fireships, two bomb vessels, a store ship, a hospital ship and two tenders. On 30 June he arrived at C√°diz and sent a letter to the British ambassador at Madrid, William Stanhope, informing Philip V of the presence of the British fleet. Alberoni wrote Byng that if he attacked the Spanish fleet he should prepare for a humiliating defeat. Stanhope replied that Britain was acting only as a mediator. Nine days later, Alberoni wrote to Stanhope that Byng would execute his sovereign's orders. George Byng. Oil on canvas by Sir Godfrey Kneller Byng resumed his voyage and by 8 July the British fleet was rejoined off Cape Spartel by the two ships with news of the Spanish fleets departure from Barcelona on 18 June. Byng was joined by Vice-admiral Charles Cornwall with a small division of two ships from Gibraltar, HMS Argyll and HMS Charles Galley. On 23 July Byng anchored off Port-Mahon and while reinforcing the garrison there was told that the Spanish fleet had been seen on 30 June off Naples. Two days later, the British fleet set sail, arriving at the Bay of Naples on 1 August. =Spanish invasion of Sicily= On 18 June a Spanish expedition sailed from Barcelona consisting of twelve ships of line, seventeen frigates, seven galleys, two fireships, and two bomb vessels, plus 276 transports and 123 tartanes commanded by Admiral Antonio de Gazta√±eta and the General Quartermaster of the Spanish navy, Jos√© Pati√±o Rosales. This fleet carried aboard 36,000 infantrymen and 8,000 horse, along with artillery, supplies, and ammunition again under the command of Marquis of Lede. their objective was the island of Sicily. On 30 June, having embarked reinforcements at the Bay of Cagliari between 25 and 27 June, the Spanish fleet came in sight of the city of Palermo. The Austrian force, surprised by Spanish numbers, evacuated Palermo. A month later, most of the island had fallen to the Spaniards with little or nor resistance, with the exception of Messina and a few coastal fortresses. As Victor Amadeus II of Savoy had agreed to surrender Sicily to the Emperor, the Austrian Viceroy of Naples, Wirich Philipp von Daun, asked Byng to transport 2,000 German infantry under General Wetzel to the citadel of Messina. Byng agreed and sailed from Naples on 6 August, while the Spanish fleet was anchored off Paradiso. Byng also proposed a \\"cessation of arms\\" in Sicily for two months, but Lede declined. With this offer rejected, Byng was left with no choice but to help the Imperialists and Savoyards resist Spanish attack. The British fleet arrived at Messina but were discovered by a Spanish felucca on 8 August, heading to the point of the Faro. The Marquis of Mari warned Gazta√±eta and Pati√±o of the inferiority of the Spanish fleet, and the Irish-born Squadron Chief George Cammock, a former officer in the British Royal Navy, proposed that the fleet anchor in the Paradiso roadstead where it could be assisted with shore batteries. This defensive position would, according to Cammock, favour the Spanish ships, as the strong currents of the Faro would throw Byng over them, thus avoiding a feared long-range cannonade. Gazta√±eta and Pati√±o, however, were confident of the peaceful intentions of Byng due to Alberoni's letters, and they decided to sail to Malta to join forces with Baltasar de Guevara.

Anonymous copy of an 18th- century work. Admiral Nicholas Haddock painting possibly by Hans Hysing The Spanish fleet sailed from the Faro Point in disorder. No defensive disposition was taken by Gazta√±eta, except to leave behind two frigates to follow the British fleet at a distance. As Byng stood in off Faro Point, both ships were detected. At the same time, a felucca from the Calabrian coast informed the British admiral that the Spanish fleet had been seen from the hills laying in. Byng dispatched German troops they were carrying to Reggio under escort of two of his ships while he headed to Faro point and sent scouts ahead. At noon they discovered the Spanish fleet, drawn into a line of battle: 27 ships of the line and frigates, two fireships, four bomb-vessels, seven galleys, and several storeships. Byng followed them during the rest of the day. A Spanish account of the battle said that, on the morning of 10 August, the Spanish ships saluted the British ones as they approached, not showing, therefore, any sign of belligerence. The night passed with fair weather; small winds and sometimes calm. The following morning the Spanish fleet was dispersed, with ships divided into three large groups separated from each other. Gazta√±eta tried then to form a line of battle by towing his ships of the line with the galleys, but had no time. The Marquis of Mari, who commanded the Spanish rear, had under his command various warships: the ship of line El Real, the frigates San Isidro, Tigre, √Åguila de Nantes, two bomb-vessels, a fireship, and some storeships, besides the galley squadron. Mari had lagged behind and was near the shore off Avola. The British vessels were close to them, and Byng dispatched Captain George Walton of with five more vessels to chase them. HMS Argyll fired two shots near De Mari's El Real, while Canterbury fired three more. Then, Mari's ship returned fire and the battle ensued with British at an advantage. The Marquis, having his ship badly mauled by the British gunfire, resolved to drive his squadron ashore, and later set fire to the ships to avoid capture. His own ship sustained fifty casualties, killed and wounded, and had her rigging severely damaged. She was ran aground and her crew escaped inland, but the ship was refloated by her British captors. Two of the Spanish frigates were completely burned; their crews also escaped. Sorpresa, under Captain Miguel de Sada, was the only ship which offered battle, but were forced to surrender, having sustained heavy damage and casualties. The other Spanish vessels struck their colours after a brief engagement, following which the British took possession of them. =Attack on the Spanish centre= The Spanish flagship San Felipe flanked on either side by British ships, probably Superbe and Kent - painting by Isaac Sailmaker. Antonio de Gazta√±eta With the Spanish rear now severed from the main fleet, Byng committed most of his vessels in pursuing Gazta√±eta's squadron, which continued its way towards Cape Passaro. The Spanish admiral had with him six ships of the line and four frigates, but had not succeeded in forming a line of battle. HMS Oxford and HMS Grafton were the first two British ships of the line to engage Gazta√±eta's centre. At 10 AM, as they approached, the disorganised Spanish vessels opened fire. The two British ships returned fired, having been ordered by Byng not to fire until the Spaniards repeated their firing. Oxford fell upon the 64-gun Santa Rosa and took her after a murderous cannonade, supported by other British ships in the distance. The 60-gun San Carlos struck her colours to Captain Thomas Matthews' HMS Kent, having made little resistance. Captain Nicholas Haddock's Grafton, meanwhile, confronted Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias (formerly HMS Cumberland), together with HMS Breda and HMS Captain. Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias was left almost shattered by Grafton and had most of her crew killed or injured, including Chac√≥n, who was wounded in the face by splinters. The ship surrendered to Breda and Captain while Grafton moved to engage another Spanish ship of sixty guns on his starboard. At 1 PM, Gazta√±eta's flagship, the 74-gun San Felipe, was attacked by Kent and soon after by Superb, from which she received two broadsides. A running fight took place for two hours between the Spanish admiral's ship, supported by three others, and Byng's division of seven ships of line and a fireship. Gazta√±eta held off his pursuers until Kent, bearing down under his stern, fired a broadside and fell to the leeward while Superb fell simultaneously on his weather-quarter. San Felipe, which could only return fire with her after guns, was left dismasted and had its hull severely mauled, but Gazta√±eta was unwilling to surrender. Byng's HMS Barfleur came close to San Felipe, and Byng demanded that Gazta√±eta strike his colours or Byng would dispatch one of his fireships against San Felipe. Gazta√±eta refused and responded with a broadside. The British fired back and he received a shot which pierced his left leg and wounded his right heel. Volante, commanded by Captain Antonio Escudero, attempted to relieve San Felipe. staying close to her with the aim to attract some of the British fire upon herself. Pierced by the fire of three British ships, she struck to HMS Montague and HMS Rupert at nightfall. San Felipe, having 200 men out of action, amongst them flag captain Pedro Dexpois, who had been hit by the shattered bones of a sailor cut in half by a cannonball, also surrendered. Of the remaining ships of Gazta√±eta's squadron, Juno meanwhile had been taken by HMS Essex after a three-hour fight. Bartholomew Dandridge =Guevara's arrival and retreat= In almost total darkness, Gazta√±eta's San Felipe struck her colours. Baltasar de Guevara, in San Luis with another ship of line, came in sight of the Spanish flagship, which had been alerted by the gunfire. Guevara's two ships bore down windward of them and exchanged a broadside with Byng's Barfleur. Told that San Felipe had surrendered, Guevara charged upon the wind and committed himself to collect the few Spanish ships still fighting on. The frigate Perla under Captain Gabriel Alderete, was relieved and allowed to escape from the three British ships. Together with another frigate, San Juan el Chicho, they left the battle, and headed towards Malta. Byng pursued them for some time, but given the fading light and low wind, he decided to stay with his fleet. George Cammock, convinced of the defeat, set sail to the Venetian island of Corfu with his flagship San Fernando and a frigate. An aerial view of the battle by Peter Monamy Francisco Grimau's seven galleys, taking advantage of favourable winds, retired to Palermo. The ships which managed to escape were, besides the galleys, four ships of the line, nine frigates, a bomb galley, and one of Pintado's ships. The 64-gun Santa Isabel, under Captain Andrea Reggio, was pursued all through the night and surrendered the next morning to Rear Admiral George Delaval. The British, in contrast, sustained trifling damage with no more than 500 killed or wounded all told. Of Byng's fleet, the ship which suffered the most damage was Grafton; but she had engaged and disabled several Spanish vessels. The necessary repairs of the Royal Navy ships, mostly in the rigging, and those relating to prizes taken, were done over the following days. On 18 August Byng received a letter from Captain Walton: =End of the battle= Walton had succeeded in capturing, by his own account, four men-of-war, a bomb vessel and a storeship in addition to burning four other men-of-war. Having repaired his damaged ships, Byng entered the port of Syracuse, then held by Savoyard troops under the Count of Maffei and blockaded by the Spanish army. From there Byng dispatched five captured Spanish ships of the line and four Spanish frigates to Port-Mahon under a heavy escort. One of his ships, Gatza√±eta's San Felipe, took fire accidentally and blew up with most of his crew; 160 British and 50 Spaniards. According to Spanish accounts, shortly after the action, a captain of the British fleet made a complaint to the Marquis of Lede in the name of Byng, stating that the Spaniards had fired first. Gazta√±eta and his officers were dispatched to Augusta in a felucca, having taken an oath not to take up arms against the Habsburg armies for four months. Of the haul of Spanish prisoners taken ‚Äì 2,600 who were wounded or sick, were also freed. Of the Spanish ships which escaped to Malta, where the Sicilian galleys under the Marquis of Rivaroles were still anchored. The Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, the Catalan Ramon Perellos y Roccaful, was a sympathiser of the House of Habsburg and refused entry to the Spanish. Aftermath Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1716. Portrait by Jan Kupeck√Ω. Byng's victory over the Spanish fleet ensured him the Sicilian throne. Having achieved his goal of destroying or capturing the bulk of Spanish fleet, Byng, then anchored at Malta. He was resolved to commit all his efforts to lift the Siege of Messina but to his surprise, even though German reinforcements broke through to the citadel, the Marquis d'Andorno surrendered on 29 September. The Marquis of Lede then held all of Sicily except the towns of Syracuse, Melazzo, and Trapani, held by considerable Savoyard garrisons for the following months. Byng detached four of his ships to eliminate Cammock's surviving ships and blockade the Spanish army. In the harbour of Augusta, the British attacked a convoy of small vessels and forced the Spaniards to burn a bomb vessel and a fireship. Off Palermo, HMS Grafton captured two Genoese vessels which had sailed from Porto Longone with a corps of Swiss mercenaries, munitions, and gunpowder. A third vessel ran aground when approached by HMS Lennox near Castellammare del Golfo and was set on fire, though its crew managed to land 240 men, 700 flintlocks and some gunpowder. As Byng's attack had virtually destroyed the Spanish fleet at Cape Passaro, the Spanish situation at Sicily considerably worsened over the months following the battle. Their army was isolated on the island, so the War Ministry informed Lede that they couldn't send troops or supplies. The blow was felt so severe by Alberoni that he banned the circulation of any information on the expedition and took measures against Great Britain, although he did not immediately declare war. He requested that ambassador Monteleone was to leave London and gave orders to issue letters of marque to privateers and to seize all British vessels and goods in the ports of Spain. This was a task in which Baltasar de Guevera played a major role when he entered the port of C√°diz with his few surviving ships. In the meantime, Byng sent his eldest son to England with a full account of the battle. When he was at Naples in November, he received a letter written personally by Emperor Charles VI: Medal commemorating the Battle made in 1718 - The Spanish fleet destroyed by Jupiter and Neptune The gods are symbolic of the Emperor (Charles VI) and the King (George I) On 26 December Great Britain declared war on Spain, France did the same soon after on 9 January the following year. In spite of the unfavourable turn of events, Alberoni was even more unwilling than at first to accept the terms dictated by the Quadruple alliance. To reverse the course of the war, Alberoni began to collect armaments and shipping at C√°diz and Corunna for an expedition to Britain itself. He sought alliance with King Charles XII of Sweden, he obtained the support of the Jacobite pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart. His plan was an invasion of the western England by 5,000 men under British turncoat James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde. To deter Swedish involvement, Britain dispatched a squadron of ten ships of the line led by John Norris to the Baltic. The Swedish ships remained at their ports, and no naval action took place. Moreover, on 11 December Charles XII was killed by a cannonball at the Siege of Fredriksten, and Spain was deprived of its only potential ally. Alberoni decided to continue the project and entrusted the command of the fleet destined to England to Baltasar de Guevara. Off Cape Finisterre the expedition was dispersed in a long and violent storm which sank several ships and scattered the fleet. Three frigates and five transports with troops reached Scotland and disembarked about 400 men, but they were promptly defeated at the Battle of Glenshiel.

He scored 51 tries for Cardiff in 115 appearances.'Cardiff Rugby Club History and Statistics 1876‚Äì1975' (1975) D.E. Davies Gabe won his first cap for Wales against Ireland in 1901, playing on the left wing. His 24 caps for Wales included the famous 1905 victory against New Zealand, and he captained Wales in the 1907 match against Ireland. He toured Australasia with the British Isles team of 1904. He played in all four test matches, including the three victories over Australia.'Cardiff Sporting Greats' (2007) Andrew Hignell and Gwyn Prescott pp 194‚Äì195 1905 Wales squad, Gabe, back row, second from right Gabe was an impressive try scorer and scored 11 tries during his Welsh career. In his first game against England in 1902 he scored a memorable try when John Strand-Jones deceived the entire English pack and passed the ball to Gabe. With only the English full back Gamlin to beat, Gabe raced to the try line and rounded Gamlin but took a heavy blow to his solar plexus. Gabe managed to carry on, cross the line, score the try, only then passing out.Davies (1980), pg 143. His most remarkable try was probably one scored against England at Bristol in 1908. The match was played in thick fog, and Gabe and his teammate Percy Bush found a loose ball outside England's 25. Gabe won the tussle for the ball and set off in the direction of the line, while Bush ran off in the opposite direction to confuse the opposition. Eventually the referee and the other players arrived at the line to find Gabe waiting with the ball.Davies (1980), pg 193. Gabe retired in 1908, but still appeared occasionally for Cardiff. He was a fine club cricketer and played occasionally for Glamorgan. He also captained Radyr Golf Club, and played at Cardiff Golf Club well into his eighties.

Bern was victorious, consolidating its position in the region. As a consequence of the conflict, the relations of Bern and the Swiss Confederacy tightened, resulting in Bern's permanent accession in 1353. This is also the first battle that the white cross was documented as being used as a field sign worn by Swiss combatants. Background Prior to hostilities the free imperial city of Bern had undergone heavy expansion, however this expansion came at high expense to the feudal lords in the area and led to increasing competition with the neighbouring city of Fribourg. Bern had been allied with Fribourg since 1241, but Fribourg had been sold to the House of Habsburg in 1277. Fribourg entered a league with neighouring feudal lords, including the County of Neuch√¢tel, the County of Savoy and the Prince-Bishop of Basel, raising a force of some 17,000 men, including a force of some 1,000 heavy cavalry under the command of Rudolf von Nidau and G√©rard de Valengin. While the cavalry were a powerful force, much of the infantry, with the exception of the Freiburg contingent, were poorly equipped and unmotivatedOman (1924), p.243 This force set out to confront Bern by besieging Laupen Castle. To raise the siege, Bern raised a force of 6,000, consisting of Bernese, supported by Forest Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden (who had entered a military alliance with Bern in 1323), and other allies (Simmental, Weissenburg, Oberhasli). The Habsburg Duke of Ausria and the Count of Kyburg assembled a force in Aargau and threatened Bern from the east. This is likely the reason that the relief force sent to Laupen was not led by the Bernese Schultheiss, Johann II von Bubenberg, who would have remained in the city preparing for a possible siege. The battle The Bernese army marched to the relief of Laupen, arriving in the afternoon of 21 June. Rather than attempt an attack on the Freiburger siege lines, they drew up their army on a hill called the Bramberg, some 3 km east-northeast of Laupen Castle, as a challenge to their enemies to come and fight. The formation of the Bernese consisted of one or more haufen, deep bodies of infantry.Delbr√ºck (1923), Oman (1924), Carey (2006) all have multiple haufen. De Vries (1996) has one To one flank, probably the left,Oman (1924) and Carey (2006) say left, because of the nature of the ground. Delbr√ºck (1923) suggests right stood the troops of the Forest Cantons. The arrival of the Bernese was noted by the Freiburgers and they rapidly armed and arrayed themselves for battle. Late in the afternoon, they launched their attack. Rudolf von Erlach is shown with his coat of arms, kneeling next to the altar. The Freiburg force was led by their cavalry, followed by the larger body of infantry. An unknown number of troops were left in the siege camp, to protect the equipment and prevent a sally by the 600 strong Bernese garrison.Heath (1982) p.58 The cavalry vanguard moved to threaten the Bernese, with a number of newly dubbed knights riding close to the Bernese lines waving their swords, but the Bernese force held its position. When the Freiburg infantry formed up, the cavalry launched an assault which brought them into contact with the Forest Canton contingent, who rapidly formed an all-round defensive formation known as a hedgehog (Igel). Away from this flank action, the Freiburger infantry advanced up the hill. The Bernese threw forward a screen of crossbowmen and stone-throwers to harass this advance but these quickly fell back as the Freiburgers closed. This seems to have caused a panic in the rear ranks of the Bernese army and a large number (up to 2,000) men fled into the forest behind the Bramberg.Carey (2006) p.188. De Vries (1996) attributes the cause of the flight to the sword-waving new knights (p.134) Remarkably, the rest of the army held firm. The two infantry lines then clashed. Despite their numerical advantage, the Freiburgers were quickly broken and fled away towards Laupen, the flight being led by the feudal contingent from Vaud.Oman (1924), p.244 The contingent from Freiburg suffered particularly heavily, losing their Burgomeister and the City standard bearer.Oman (1924), p.245 Showing great control, a part of the Bernese army reordered itself and marched to relieve the Forest Cantons, who were still surrounded by the Freiburger's cavalry. The action here was possibly the fiercest of the day, with the horsemen now fighting on two fronts themselves. After a short bloody struggle, the cavalry were routed and suffered heavy casualties. At least 80 nobles fell, including the Counts of Nidau, Valengin and AarburgOman (1924), p.245 and the son of Louis II of Vaud.De Vries (1996), p. 135 The evening was now drawing on, which limited pursuit, but the Bernese forces marched into Laupen, where celebrations and services of thanksgiving for the victory were held.De Vries (1996), p. 135 Aftermath Monument to the battle on Bramberg, Neuenegg municipality, design by Karl Marcell Heigelin (1798-1833), inscribed In memoriam proelii Laupensis e quo Bernenses cum sociis die 21 junii 1339 victore discessere, with the coat of arms of Erlach, Hic lapis positus est 1853. The Habsburg force in the east could not reach Laupen in time for joining the battle and dispersed upon receiving news of the defeat. The victory of the Bernese/Swiss against all odds, outnumbered two-to-one by an army containing such a force of mounted chivalry, came as a surprise, and chroniclers record that comments like \\"God himself must have become a Bernese citizen\\" were heard among the retreating Habsburg troops. Bern was drawn into closer association with the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the Eight Cantons in 1353. The rivalry between Bern and Fribourg continued throughout the 14th century but did not erupt into military conflict again. Fribourg acquired substantial territories in the vicinity of Bern, but these were all lost again in the wake of the Battle of Sempach, with the 1389 peace treaty between Habsburg and the Swiss Confederacy. Fribourg renewed its alliance with Bern in 1403 and abandoned its expansionist policies, focusing on the acquisition of territories in its immediate neighbourhood. This permitted the rise of Bern as the most powerful city republic north of the alps by the early modern period, and paved the way for the accession of Fribourg as an associate of the Swiss Confederacy by 1454 and as a full member in 1481. Wider significance Comparable to the Battle of Bannockburn 25 years earlier, Laupen was one of a string of battles presaging the definite decline of high medieval heavy cavalry (the classical \\"knights\\" of the 12th and 13th centuries) in the face of improving infantry tactics during the following century. The battle is also the first occasion for which use of the Swiss cross as a badge to identify confederate troops is attested;History of Switzerland it was shown on combatants' clothing as two stripes of textile. Diebold Schilling the Elder in the 1480s makes a point of showing this field sign as worn by troops of the Forest Cantons as a white cross in a red field, while it is not yet attached to the cantonal banners. In the same illustrations, the attacking Savoyard cavalry displays the white-on- red cross of Savoy both in its banner and on cavalry shields. The battle has an important position in Swiss military history as the first victory in open battle of the Swiss Confederacy over Habsburg. The Swiss had already routed a Habsburg army in the Battle of Morgarten in 1315, but this had been an ambush on a marching army and not an open field battle. The drawn-out conflict with Habsburg was one of the main driving forces of the foundation and growth of the Confederacy, lasting for full two centuries, from the death of Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany in 1291 until the peace treaty of 1511 in the aftermath of the Swabian War. It was the continued conflict with Albert II of Habsburg that prompted the accession of Z√ºrich, Glarus, Zug and Bern to the confederacy, forming the Eight Cantons. After a brief Habsburg-Confederate alliance against an external threat in the so-called Gugler war of 1375, the conflict re-emerged in the 1380s, culminating in the Habsburg defeat in the Battle of Sempach in 1386.

In computing, a router on a stick, also known as a one-armed router, is a router that has a single physical or logical connection to a network. It is often used to forward traffic between locally attached hosts on separate logical routing domains or to facilitate routing table administration, distribution and relay. Details One-armed routers that perform traffic forwarding are often implemented on virtual local area networks (VLANs). They would use a single Ethernet network interface port that is part of two or more Virtual LANs, enabling them to be joined. A VLAN allows multiple virtual LANs to coexist on the same physical LAN. This means that two machines attached to the same switch cannot send Ethernet frames to each other even though they pass over the same wires. If they need to communicate, then a router must be placed between the two VLANs to forward packets, just as if the two LANs were physically isolated. The only difference is that the router in question may contain only a single Ethernet network interface controller (NIC) that is part of both VLANs. Hence, \\"one-armed\\". While uncommon, hosts on the same physical medium may be assigned with addresses and to different networks. A one-armed router could be assigned addresses for each network and be used to forward traffic between locally distinct networks and to remote networks through another gateway. One-armed routers are also used for administration purposes such as route collection, multi hop relay and looking glass servers. All traffic goes over the trunk twice, so the theoretical maximum sum of up and download speed is the line rate. For a two-armed configuration, uploading does not need to impact download performance significantly.

His imagery is particularly associated with the punk movement, Queen, David Bowie, and Duran Duran, and O'Regan has photographed everyone from AC/DC to ZZ Top, documenting Punk, New Romanticism, Grunge, and Heavy Metal along the way. O'Regan has undertaken many European, US, and World tours, worked as official photographer at Live Aid and the Concert For Diana, and travelled as official photographer to David Bowie, Duran Duran, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Queen, Kiss, Europe, Neil Diamond, Bee Gees, Pink Floyd and Thin Lizzy. His work has been widely published and exhibited. Early years Born in London in November 1953, O'Regan grew up in Barnes, West London and attended St Benedict's School, following which he was offered a place at nearby Ealing Art College, famously attended a generation before by rock elite Freddie Mercury, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, Ray Davies and Pete Townshend. However, parental influence prevailed and he was temporarily diverted towards a position in the City of London as a trainee broker at Willis Faber & Dumas, then as a trainee underwriter at Lloyd's of London. Prior to this orthodox career move, O'Regan had seen The Beatles at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1964 with his mother, Marie. In the early 1970s, he smuggled a camera into the same venue to photograph Paul McCartney and Queen. Inspired by seeing Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page perform at Alexandra Palace, and David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust at Hammersmith, O'Regan taught himself photography. He resigned his day job, toured Europe on a student rail pass, and returned to comprehensively document the readily- accessible Punk explosion in London. A major contributor to NME in the late Seventies, O'Regan combined his love of photography and travel when in the Eighties he toured with some of the world's top rock bands, including those he had grown up with as a fan. World tours As official photographer O‚ÄôRegan undertook European and World tours with many artists, including Thin Lizzy in 1980, 1981, and 1982; David Bowie in 1983, 1987, and 1990; The Rolling Stones in 1982; Duran Duran over many years including their most successful tour in 1984; Spandau Ballet and Neil Diamond in 1985; Queen in 1986; Pink Floyd in 1994; KISS in 2008. During this period he was commissioned to shoot shows that set attendance records for the UK, Southern Hemisphere, and Eastern Bloc. O‚ÄôRegan was appointed official photographer for Live Aid at Wembley Stadium in 1985, and in co-operation with Bob Geldof produced the record-selling commemorative book. He also shot Live 8 in Hyde Park as an official photographer in 2005. Record album covers featuring his live work include Queen's Live Magic, Live at Wembley '86, Queen on Fire - Live at the Bowl, Knebworth '90, Thin Lizzy's 'Wild One: the Very Best of Thin Lizzy' & 'Still Dangerous: Live at the Tower Theatre Philadelphia', Pink Floyd's P*U*L*S*E, Sting's 'Bring on the Night', The Cure's 'Seventeen Seconds', Duran Duran's Decade: Greatest Hits, and the Rolling Stones' Forty Licks. Published work Denis O‚ÄôRegan has produced numerous books, including Images of Punk, Queen's A Magic Tour and Queen ‚Äì The Full Picture, David Bowie's Serious Moonlight world tour, Duran Duran's Sing Blue Silver, and his work has featured in publications such as Time, Life, Newsweek, \\"Rolling Stone\\", \\"GQ\\" and Photo as well as every UK national newspaper, and pop and rock magazines across the world. Other past clients include Pepsi, HBO, MTV, VH1, and Aston Martin. The 2018 'Ricochet : David Bowie 1983' book was a huge success both in hardback published by Penguin Random House; and as a limited edition boxed set containing five books, limited edition vinyl and fine art prints, published by Moonlight Books. The books comprehensively and intimately document David Bowie's most successful year following the release of his 'Let's Dance' album. The Ricochet boxed set was the first product to feature the David Bowie estate stamp, and it has been entered into the Victoria & Albert Museum's permanent collection in London. In 1999 Peter Blake (artist) (designer of the Beatles' Sergeant Pepper album cover) used a Denis O'Regan picture of Freddie Mercury in his design for the Royal Mail's Millennium first class postage stamp. His photographs of Queen band members Freddie Mercury and Brian May also graced Royal Mail stamps released in 2020. O'Regan received a dedication from UK 'lad lit' writer Tony Parsons in his Punk eulogy 'The Boy Looked at Johnny', and features in diverse biographies and autobiographies including The Fun Starts Here by 'Mrs Geldof' Paula Yates. One of Keith Richards' favourite O'Regan photographs - a live shot with Charlie Watts - is featured in Richards' 2010 autobiography Life. Digital age It is widely accepted that O‚ÄôRegan pioneered the use of autofocus cameras (in 1987) and digital cameras in the late 1990s. He digitally shot and uploaded photos to national press from the backstage area of the MTV 1998 European Music Awards, and Paul McCartney's return to The Cavern in 1999. His pictures of the latter made the front pages of every UK national newspaper the following morning, including The Daily Telegraph, The Times and the Daily Mail. In the same year O‚ÄôRegan founded one of the UK's first legal music download sites, which sold a milestone 25,000 tracks in the months prior to the Millennium (four years before the launch of Apple's iTunes store). He grew up in Barnes, West London, at the same time as Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web. Recent updates O'Regan worked closely with Duran Duran during the 1980s and 1990s and reunited with the reformed band for rehearsals in 2003 and European tours in 2004/2005. Having covered Pink Floyd's final tour - The Division Bell in 1994, he also shot their final ever performance at Live 8 in London's Hyde Park in 2005. His work has been exhibited at various venues including Proud Galleries, the Air Gallery, backstage at MTV's European Music Awards (London & Rome), backstage at Wembley Arena, and at Apple's flagship London Store on Regent Street. In 2016 he was the only non-US photographer featured in the Coachella 'Desert Trip' exhibition, which was attended by 100,000 visitors. Denis was appointed official photographer for the 1996-1999 MTV European Music Awards; 2006-2009 Download festivals; Kylie Minogue's 2006/2007 UK Showgirl tour; Prince William and Prince Harry's 2007 Concert For Diana at the new Wembley Stadium, where he took all the official backstage portraits; Glastonbury 2011; and Coachella festival, which he has regularly covered for the organisers.

Built as a royal hunting lodge in the early 18th century, it is located in Stupinigi, a suburb of the town of Nichelino, southwest of Turin. History The original castle was owned by the Acaja line of the House of Savoy, Lords of Piedmont until 1418, and was sold to marquis Rolando Pallavicino in 1493. It was then acquired by Emmanuel Philibert in 1563, when the ducal capital was moved from Chamb√©ry to Turin. Detail of the vaulting of the Central Hall The new palace was designed by the architect Filippo Juvarra to be used as a palazzina di caccia (\\"hunting lodge\\") for Victor Amadeus II, King of Sardinia.Doreen Yarwood, A Chronology of Western Architecture, (Dover Publications, 2010), 151. Works started in 1729. Within two years construction was far enough advanced for the first formal hunt to take place. Juvarra called upon a team of decorators, many of them from Venice, to carry out the decor of the palazzina interiors. In the reigns of Carlo Emanuele III and Victor Amadeus III the palazzina and its formal park continued to be extended, at first by Juvarra's assistant, Giovanni Tommaso Prunotto, then by numerous North Italian architects, such as Ignazio Birago di Borgaro, Ludovico Bo, Ignazio Bertola and Benedetto Alfieri. The final building has a total of 137 rooms and 17 galleries, and covers 31,050 square meters. Polissena of Hesse- Rotenburg, wife of Carlo Emanuele III also carried out improvements. The original purpose of the hunting lodge is symbolized by the bronze stag perched at the apex of the stepped roof of its central dome, and the hounds' heads that decorate the vases on the roofline. The building has a saltire plan: four angled wings project from the oval-shaped main hall. The extensions resulted in separate pavilions linked by long angled galleries and a long octagonal forecourt enclosed by wings, extended forwards in two further entrance courts. Stupinigi was the preferred building to be used for celebrations and dynastic weddings by members of the House of Savoy. Here, in 1773, Maria Teresa, Princess of Savoy, married Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, brother of Louis XVI and the future Charles X of France. Today the Palace of Stupinigi houses the Museo di Arte e Ammobiliamento, a museum of the arts and furnishings, some original to the palazzina, others brought from the former Savoia residences of Moncalieri and Venaria Reale. Stupinigi has the most important collection of Piedmontese furniture, including works by Turin's three most famous Royal cabinet-makers, Giuseppe Maria Bonzanigo, Pietro Piffetti and Luigi Prinotti. Some of the sculptures of hunting figures are by Giovanni Battista Bernero. Additionally, temporary exhibitions are held in its galleries, such as the Mostra del Barocco (1963). Anna Caterina Gilli was active as a decorative painter at the palace.Profile of Anna Caterina Gilli at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800. Description The plan of the building is defined by the four arms of St. Andrew's Cross, divided by the central axis that is aligned with the path that leads from Turin to the palace through a tree-lined avenue that runs alongside farms and stables and other old dependencies of the building. The core nucleus consists of a large central oval hall from which the four wings depart, which the royal apartments and those for guests. The large double-height oval hall with balconies concave-convex, is covered by dome surmounted by the statue of the \\"Cervo\\", by Francesco Ladatte. With the departure of Juvarra from Turin, the Prince Charles Emmanuel III entrusted the direction of the work to Giovanni Tommaso Prunotto, who provided for the expansion of the building starting from the sketches left by Juvarra, thus trying to safeguard the complex play of lights and shapes. The interior is in Italian Rococo, made of precious materials such as lacquers, porcelains, gilded stuccos, mirrors and roots that today extend on an area of about 31,000 square meters, while 14,000 are occupied by adjacent buildings, 150,000 by the park and 3,800 by the external flowerbeds; Overall, there are 137 rooms and 17 galleries. Among the fine furniture made for the building should be mentioned those of the carver Giuseppe Maria Bonzanigo, Pietro Piffetti and Luigi Prinotto. The building preserves decorations by the Venetian painters Giuseppe and Domenico Valeriani, by Gaetano Perego, and by the Viennese Christan Wehrlin. The frescoes by Vittorio Amedeo Cignaroli, Gian Battista Crosato and Carlo Andrea Van Loo are also noteworthy. = Entrance = The entrance to the complex gives access to the vast area of the Galleria dei Ritratti (Portrait Gallery) which was part of the side stables designed and built by Filippo Juvarra after the completion of the central complex of the building. This space was therefore used for the carriages and coaches and to house horses during the hunts. Here today stands the original statue of Stupinigi's deer created by Francesco Ladatte in 1766 which overlooked the dome of the central hall. It was placed in this room in 1992 and the top of the dome was replaced with a modern bronze copy. The sculpture is surrounded by carved wooden bas- relief portraits commissioned by Vittorio Emanuele II and originally intended for the Moncalieri Castle. In the first library and then in the second library one can find the change of taste in the mid-eighteenth century when the stables area was reduced to make room for a library sandwiched with shelves designed by Benedetto Alfieri and painted in blue, ivory and gold, accompanied by allegories of the arts and sciences painted by Giuseppe Nogari. = Apartment of the Duke of Chiablese = Gambling hall Also called \\"Appartamento di Levante\\" (as opposed to the specular Appartamento di Ponente), the set of rooms was enlarged under the direction of Benedetto Alfieri in the 18th century to accommodate the rooms of Benedetto di Savoia, Duke of Chiablese, son of King Carlo Emanuele III.  Gambling hall  The room of greater consistency for size and style in the apartments of the Duke of Chiablese is undoubtedly the gambling hall, a large space intended for the leisure of the court inserted into a rectangular hall with rounded corners and two large niches on the sides more short. The ceiling, decorated by Giovanni Pietro Pozzo in 1765, incorporates the same exotic and oriental motifs of the walls that play the role of an elegant frame for the game furniture inside the room: a mid-eighteenth century drawing room, a game table Louis XV style with a precious chessboard inlaid with ebony and ivory, as well as a desk with refined ivory figures inlaid from the beginning of the 18th century. Noteworthy are also the chinoiserie and the porcelains present in this environment that are well suited to the exotic decoration of the complex.  Hall of Mirrors and Cabinet of Pauline Bonaparte  The first room, decorated with a very special rococo style, is decorated with stuccos and mirrors from the walls to the ceiling, idea of Giovanni Pietro Pozzo in 1766 with the help of Michele Antonio Rapous in the realization of the boiserie. The chandelier dating back to the 1940s is more ancient and is decorated with sculptures of wrought iron birds. The Cabinet of Pauline Bonaparte owes its fame to the fact that it was made to equip in current forms by Pauline Bonaparte, Napoleon's sister, during her period of stay at the palace when her husband Camillo Borghese was appointed governor of Piedmont. The room, small in size, contains a beautiful marble bathtub, decorated with bas-reliefs representing the imperial insignia with the Napoleonic eagle. = Central Hall = The central hall, the core of the building, was the first idea of Juvarra to be completed and the focus around which its entire building complex was developed. The room consists of a large oval-shaped room culminating in a dome enclosed by a vaulted ceiling. The hall was completed in 1730 and on 10 February 1731 the king commissioned to the Bolognese brothers Giuseppe and Domenico Valeriani a large fresco on the vault, depicting the Triumph of Diana, the classic goddess of hunting that appears between the clouds, above a celestial chariot overlooking woods. Around there are also putti with game or wreaths of flowers, flanked by nymphs. At the apex of the four pillars that support the dome of the hall, just below the large fresco, there are four monochromatic medallions representing similar episodes related to the same deity. The works for the realization of such frescoes began already on March 8th, ending in 1733. Juvarra imposed a quadrature scheme on the two brothers so as not to ruin his complex overall design.  Frescoes of the upper vault  The Central Hall After Juvarra left, his idea to place large sculptural groups of dogs and deer in the large windows of the salon was abandoned, so as not to excessively limit the splendid perspective view that is still enjoyed looking outwards. The project was entrusted to Giuseppe Marocco, who envisioned the thirty-six wooden fans (appliques) with deer heads that show off themselves on the walls of the hall. From the same period are the gilded wood inlays of the balustrade of the singers in the upper part of the hall and the paracamels painted by the Lombard Giovanni Crivelli (1733). Also worthy of note are the four marble busts made in 1773 by Giovanni Battista Bernero, which overlook the same number of entrances to the hall and which represent minor divinities linked to hunting and the fields: Ceres, Pomona, Naiad and Napea. The salon, steeped in its structure and in the decorations characteristic of the eighteenth century, also attracted the attention of several contemporaries who were able to see it personally as the French engraver Charles Nicolas Cochin, who however criticized the superabundance of decorations and excessive eccentricity. Of the same opinion was Joseph Jerome Lalande, who reported how the Juvarra was almost completely focused on the salon, leaving behind all the rest and revealing how it was arranged as the \\"dream of an architect\\", too risky for a city palace and only for a sumptuous country residence. The park The hunting park that belonged to a branch of the House of Savoia was given to Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy in 1563, when he moved the capital of the duke from Chamb√©ry to Turin. The garden of the hunting lodge and the surrounding hunting estate are clearly distinguished in Stupinigi: the complex, in fact, is part of a large geometric garden, characterized by a continuous succession of flowerbeds, parterres and avenues. This park, bordered by a wall and intersected by long avenues, was designed by the French gardener Michael Benard in 1740. The hunting park, or estate, was instead constituted by the vast area of almost 1,700 hectares that extended outside the fenced park and which had been expropriated by the Duke Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia in 1563 from the Pallavicini. This area included land and woods included today in the municipalities of Nichelino, Orbassano and Candiolo. Since 1992, woods and agricultural land surrounding Stupinigi have been preserved as the Parco naturale di Stupinigi. Included in the communal territories of Nichelino, Candiolo and Orbassano, it has an area of that includes a part of the region's original lowland forest, where visitors can admire some rare plant species no longer widely found elsewhere. Wildlife includes beech martens, weasels, foxes, hazel dormouses, European hares, white storks, tree squirrels and others.

He was Minister President of Baden-W√ºrttemberg from 1966 to 1978 and as such also chaired the Bundesrat in 1973/74. He founded the conservative think tank Studienzentrum Weikersheim, which he chaired until 1997. Filbinger had to resign as minister president and party chairman after allegations about his role as a navy lawyer and judge in the Second World War. While the CDU Baden-W√ºrttemberg elected him honorary chairman ‚Äî a position he held until his death ‚Äî he remained a controversial figure. Professional and family life Filbinger was born on 15 September 1913 in Mannheim, Grand Duchy of Baden. He studied law and economics at the University of Freiburg, the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and in Paris. Having earned his doctorate in 1939 with the dissertation \\"Limits to majority rule in stock and corporation law\\", he worked as a lecturer at the University of Freiburg. In 1940 he passed his final examination. Filbinger, a Catholic, was married to Ingeborg Breuer and had four daughters and a son. One of his daughters, Susanna Filbinger-Riggert (born 1951) wrote a book: Kein wei√ües Blatt. It is a father-daughter biography. (2013). Filbinger and the Nazi Party Filbinger first came into contact with Nazi organisations as a student. He was a member of the Jugendbund Neudeutschland (Youth Federation New-Germany), which he had joined in grammar school. As this Catholic students' federation with political leanings to the Centre Party opposed their being integrated into the Hitler Youth, it was banned. Filbinger, who was a leading member in the district of Northern Baden, in April 1933 called his fellow members to continue their work with their previous intentions and issue a programme for the upcoming future.See hans-filbinger.de for a facsimile of this programme. As a result, the NSDAP deemed him \\"politically unreliable\\". On 1 June 1933, Filbinger joined the Sturmabteilung (SA), and later also the National Socialist students federation, but largely remained an inactive member. Attorney General Brettle advised Filbinger, as he was applying for his first examination in January 1937, that he could not expect to be admitted to the Referendariat, the preparatory service required for future state employees without having cleared himself from these political complaints.See H√ºrten, J√§ger, Ott (1980). Seeing himself barred from the second examination and hence blocked from any further professional career, Filbinger asked to be admitted to NS party membership in spring.Philosopher Karl Jaspers commented on this: \\"Membership of the party ... was no longer a political act but an act of grace by the state, which would accept the person in question.\\" (Zur Lage Deutschlands in den Jahren 1936/1937, Die Schuldfrage, Heidelberg 1946) Filbinger during the war In 1940, Filbinger was conscripted into the German Navy. He was promoted to the rank of Oberf√§hnrich and later to that of lieutenant. In 1943 he was ordered to enter the military legal department - according to his own account, against his will. Two attempts at avoiding this by volunteering for submarine squads didn't succeed.See Filbinger (1987). Filbinger served in the legal department until the end of the war in 1945. This period of his life was later raised to prominence in the Filbinger affair. During that time he was a member of the Freiburg Circles, a group of Catholic intellectuals centred around the publisher Karl F√§rber. Filbinger used his periods of leave to return to Freiburg and attend lectures by Reinhold Schneider, a writer critical of the Nazi regime. Without his knowledge, two of the conspirators of the 20 July Plot‚ÄîKarl Sack and Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg‚Äîrecommended Filbinger for employment after a successful coup, adding that one could always rely on Filbinger's \\"principled anti-Nazi stance and loyalty\\". Gillessen, G√ºnter (2003): Der Fall Filbinger. Die Politische Meinung 408: 67-74. PDF fulltext Early post-war career In 1946, Filbinger resumed his academic work at the university of Freiburg, subscribing to Walter Eucken's ordoliberalism, and settled down as lawyer. In 1947, he was coopted into the International anti- trust commission, chaired by Eucken and Karl Gailer. In 1951 Filbinger joined the Christian Democratic Union and rose to be chairman of the CDU of Southern Baden. In 1953, Filbinger was elected to the city council of Freiburg. In 1958, minister-president Gebhard M√ºller appointed him an honorary state council. As such he was a member of the state government, mainly concerned with the interests of Southern Baden in the young state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In 1960, Filbinger was appointed Minister of the Interior. In the same year, he was elected into the state parliament of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, in which he represented the city of Freiburg. He remained a member of parliament until 1980. Minister-president of Baden-W√ºrttemberg In 1966, minister-president Kurt Georg Kiesinger was elected Chancellor of Germany and Filbinger succeeded him as minister-president of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. At that time, the CDU's coalition partner FDP broke with the CDU in order to form a government with the SPD. Dramatic negotiations resulted in Filbinger forming a CDU-SPD government, mirroring the Federal Great Coalition. The Great Coalition continued after the state elections of 1968 and went on to reform the administrative system. This reform merged many towns and districts to create more viable units. According to Filbinger, towns are \\"true sources of power for the state and provide the citizen with the feeling ... of having a home\\". The results transcended the historical borders of the historic regions of Baden and W√ºrttemberg. The two regions had only been united in 1952 after a referendum. Their relationship had never been easy and the opposition against the new \\"South-West State\\" remained strong in Baden. Proponents of Baden's independence raised concerns about the legitimacy of the 1951 referendum because of the controversial voting modalities. In 1956, the Federal Constitutional Court declared the modalities and the merger of the states legal but added that the will of the people of Baden had indeed been glossed over by political machinations. The decision had no immediate consequences until Filbinger became Minister-President. He himself hailed from Baden and after the court had reiterated its earlier verdict in 1969, the Filbinger administration in 1970 held a second referendum in Baden, which resulted in an overwhelming approval of the merger. Filbinger has been dubbed \\"architect of Baden-W√ºrttemberg's unity\\" for this. Filbinger also pushed his party, that still was organized as four distinct regional parties to unite into a single CDU of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and was duly elected the first chairman. In the 1972 state elections, the Filbinger's CDU achieve 52,9% of the vote, gaining an absolute majority for the first time. In 1976, campaigning under the slogan \\"Freedom instead of socialism\\", he increased his party's vote to a hitherto unsurpassed 56,7%. Filbinger was a staunch opponent of leftist tendencies in politics and the universities, and figured prominently in the struggle against terrorism. Against nationwide trends, he opposed comprehensive schools and expanded the state's tripartial school system (Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium) and also vocational schools. As minister-president of Baden- W√ºrrtemberg, he was President of the Bundesrat, the representation of the states on the federal level, from 1973 to 1974. During the 1970s, Filbinger enjoyed a tremendous popularity as a patriarchal figure. He was elected a member of federal CDU executive board and also deputy chairman. Analysts even deemed him a possible candidate for the presidential elections in 1979, when his career suddenly ended in 1978 due to the Filbinger affaire (see below), an event from which his reputation has never recovered. Filbinger affair The first criticism of Filbinger's war time record dates back to 10 April 1972. Two weeks before the Baden-W√ºrttemberg state elections, the Der Spiegel magazine published one of Filbinger's verdicts. On 29 May 1945, Filbinger presided at the trial against artillery man Petzold and sentenced him to six months imprisonment for incitement of discontent, refusal of obedience and resistance. In an editorial, the Spiegel also claimed that, based on Petzold's memories, Filbinger had referred to Hitler as \\"our beloved F√ºhrer ... who has brought the fatherland back up\\". Filbinger immediately reacted by filing a lawsuit against the Spiegel, demanding that the Spiegel desist from making such a claim. The court decided in favour of Filbinger, since it found Petzold an unreliable witness and the alleged quote in conflict with Filbinger's other utterances and actions. Nonetheless, allegations against Filbinger continued at various occasions, e.g. in 1974 when Filbinger as President of the Bundesrat spoke at the tricennial of the July 20 Plot, or in 1975 during the debate about a nuclear facility at Wyhl. Debaters often twisted or neglected the existing evidence or confused the circumstance, Petzold's anti-Nazi stance in particular, with the actual verdict.Neubauer (1990): 12-34. Filbinger's verdict against Petzold was especially criticized for having occurred after the surrender of the German military on 8 May 1945. However, the British military command had charged German officers in Norway with maintaining order among the German prisoners-of-war. Later the Petzold trial was confused with other cases involving Filbinger, creating the legend that Filbinger had sentenced a soldier to death for having spoken out against Nazism after German surrender. The controversy was brought to the boiling point by the controversial German author Rolf Hochhuth. On 17 February 1978 the German weekly Die Zeit published a preview from Hochhuth's novel A Love in Germany (published October 1978), the backbone of which was the case of seaman Walter Gr√∂ger. Hochhuth accused Filbinger of having \\"participated\\" in four death sentences as a navy lawyer. The Petzold trial, though not involving a death sentence, Hochhuth deemed \\"outrageous\\" for having been held after the end of war. In his allegations, Hochhuth called Filbinger \\"such a dreadful lawyer, so that one has to presume that ... he is only living in freedom because of the silence of those who knew him.\\" As in the previous case, Filbinger filed a lawsuit against Hochhuth and Die Zeit, seeking to have the claim quoted above banned as libel. In contrast to the previous case, the court did not take the incriminated sentence as a unit but analysed and judged it bit by bit. On June 13, 1978 the court decided that Hochhuth's claims about illegal behaviour were indeed a libellous charges and banned the author from repeating them. However, The term \\"a dreadful lawyer\\" was deemed a judgement of opinion protected by freedom of speech. The court has been criticized for mistaken the causal connection between the two statements for a simple addition.Neubauer (1990): 359-363. Filbinger abstained from appealing the court's decision, and though Hochhuth did not repeat his \\"illegality\\" charges (and later even claimed that no one ever made such charges) the other allegation were echoed and variegated by the media. =Capital cases involving Filbinger= During his stint as a Navy lawyer, Filbinger had been involved in 230 cases, of which six were of a capital nature. In three of these cases, Filbinger was the attorney for the prosecution, in two cases he had been the presiding judge and in one case he had interfered from outside. In May 1943 several seamen employed in clearing up the scene after an air raid on Kiel were accused of having stolen some petty goods from a drug store. Filbinger, as prosecutor, demanded the death penalty for the ringleader Kr√§mer and the judge did sentence Kr√§mer to death. After the verdict, Filbinger again interrogated the seaman about the incident and afterwards wrote a report putting the condemned man in a positive light. Filbinger appended this report to the verdict that had to be sent to the superior commander for confirmation and as the commander asked Filbinger to comment on the question whether the man should be pardoned, the prosecutor made the case for commuting the death penalty into a prison sentence. The commander agreed and sent Kr√§mer into a punitive camp. Filbinger himself called his actions \\"an act of artifice, of manipulation, a lie, without a doubt\\". The second case was the case on which Hochhuth's novel was based. The seaman Walter Gr√∂ger, deployed to Norway, had planned to desert and flee to Sweden with his Norwegian lover. The couple was found out and arrested and Gr√∂ger sentenced to eight years of prison. However, the commander of the fleet denied confirmation, returned the case to the Oslo court martial and ordered the prosecution to demand the death penalty. On the day of the trial, the original prosecutor, who already had pleaded for the death penalty, was prevented participating and Filbinger, who hadn't been involved in the case, was appointed prosecutor. According to the Admiral's orders, Filbinger demanded the death penalty and the court sentenced the seaman to death. Admiral D√∂nitz rejected a plea for pardon. On 16 March 1945 Gr√∂ger was executed and, according to military custom, Filbinger supervised the execution. In two cases Filbinger saved opponents of the regime from execution: He interfered in the confirmation process of the case of military chaplain M√∂bius, who had been sentenced to death for a political statement. The case was reopened in spring 1945 and M√∂bius subsequently acquitted. As prosecutor in the case against Lieutenant Forstmeier, who had made some remarks about the July 20 Plot, he influenced the witnesses to testimonies, that could be interpreted in the defendant's favour, prolonged the proceedings and obtained a verdict of demotion and imprisonment on parole. Forstmeier was supposed to be sent to frontline combat, but the end of the war prevented this. Finally, Filbinger issued two death sentences as a Navy judge: On 9 April, the Oslo court martial chaired by Filbinger dealt with the case of four seamen, who had killed their commanding officer and fled to Sweden. In absentia, the court sentenced them to death for murder and desertion. (In 1952, one of the seamen was again brought to trial and sentenced to ten years in prison). On 17 April 1945, Filbinger chaired the absentia trial against an Oberststeuermann who had taken his boat and fourteen seamen to Sweden and sentenced the senior NCO to death for desertion and undermining morale. Both verdicts were issued in absentia and could not reach the defendants. These two death sentences have been explained as an attempt of avoiding a breaking down of military discipline even at the end of the war, especially since the Navy was involved in evacuating two million Germans from East Prussia that was encircled by the Red Army. According to Veteran FAZ editor G√ºnter Gillessen, who reviewed the case in 2003, the facts paint a picture different from that of a bloodthirsty and unrepentant Nazi judge. this view was bolstered by Adolf Harms, who worked as a judge alongside Filbinger, including on the Gr√∂ger case. Harms described Filbinger as \\"no fierce dog\\", \\"definitely not a Nazi\\" and as someone with a decidedly negative attitude towards the then current political leadership\\".Quoted in Die Zeit, 12.05.1978 =Filbinger's reaction= Filbinger was not only criticized for his actions during the war, but also for his reactions to the allegations in 1978: In his first reactions to the allegations, Filbinger had claimed that he had \\"never issued a single death sentence\\", which was later contradicted by the revelation of the two in absentia cases from April 1945.Hans Filbinger. In den Str√∂mungen der Zeit. Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 13 April 2007: 2. That Filbinger recalled the two death sentences of 1945 only during the controversy in 1978 seemed incredible and outrageous to many. Filbinger explained this by characterizing the verdicts as \\"phantom verdicts\\" with no further consequences for the absent defendants. Another issue revolves around the sentence \\"Was damals rechtens war, kann heute nicht Unrecht sein\\"Aff√§re Filbinger: \\"Was Rechtens war ...\\" Der Spiegel, 15 May 1978 (\\"What was lawful then, cannot be unlawful today.\\"). This comment was part of an interview the Spiegel had conducted with Filbinger on 15 May 1978. The Spiegel interpreted the quote as a justification of Nazi laws, whereas Filbinger had referred to the military penal code of 1872, that was in force throughout the Second World War. Filbinger complained that his quote had been edited and taken out of context and his then spokesman Gerhard Goll, who had been present during the interview, called the magazine's interpretation \\"not only untrue but also an infamy\\". Goll stated that Filbinger was referring in particular the fact that all nations in 1945 considered the death penalty as an adequate and necessary deterrent against desertion, whereas he had always considered and labelled the Nazi state as a \\"tyranny of injustice\\". Still, the quote as originally published stuck with Filbinger and has been the basis of much of the recurring criticism. Since then Spiegel, Zeit and other media have repeated the controversial interpretations, leading to letters of protest by Filbinger. In 1991, the Zeit was forced by court injunction to publish corrections. Filbinger's critics have been criticized for violating the presumption of innocence and for putting their adversary in a vicious circle, in which a rejection of allegations is taken as a confirmation of guilt.Neubauer (1990): 267. summarizes this under the motto Qui s'excuse, s'accuse (\\"who excuses himself, accuses himself\\"). Filbinger has been criticized for not enquiring about other cases after the first allegations, for not being forthcoming enough or for placing too much emphasis on the legal dimension of the allegations.Neubauer (1990): 265-298. =Filbinger's resignation= After CDU politicians had joined in the criticism, Filbinger resigned as minister-president on 7 August 1978, and also as chairman of the CDU Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In both positions, he was succeeded by Lothar Sp√§th. Despite this, the CDU Baden-W√ºrttemberg appointed him honorary chairman in 1979, which he remained until his death. Filbinger also had to relinquish his offices in the federal party, resigning as deputy chairman in 1978 and giving up his seat on the executive board in 1981. As he resigned from office, Filbinger stated that the attacks would be revealed as untrue, if they hadn't been so yet. Some historians and lawyers have agreed with this, while others dispute this conclusion. The CDU Baden- W√ºrttemberg considers Filbinger as rehabilitated.In 2003, Erwin Teufel, then ministerpresident and CDU chairman, wrote in the preface to Fred Ludwig Sepaintner's book Hans Filbinger - Aus neun Jahrzehnten: \\"Filbinger had to wait a long time for his rehabilitation. But it has occurred long ago.\\" Subsequent events After his withdrawal from politics, Filbinger in 1979 founded the conservative think tank Studienzentrum Weikersheim (Weikersheim Centre of Studies), which he chaired until 1997. In 1987, Filbinger published his memoirs titled Die geschm√§hte Generation (The slandered generation), in which he again defended himself against his critics. In a review of this book, historian Golo Mann called the events of 1978 a \\"masterly orchestrated hunt against Filbinger\\". After the collapse of the GDR in 1989/90, two Stasi lieutenants revealed that they had been involved in the campaign against Filbinger: :\\"We have fought against Filbinger actively, that means we have collected material and have leaked forged or manipulated material into the west. The fight against Filbinger was a substantial part of \\"Action Black\\", a long lasting campaign against conservatives, CDU/CSU, Fascists.\\" Stasi document P3333 reveals that Filbinger had been spied on since the end of the 1960s.Bohnsack, G√ºnther & Brehmer, Herbert (1992): Auftrag Irref√ºhrung, wie die Stasi Politik im Westen machte. Carlsen, Hamburg. . Note that the use of the word Fascist adheres to usage prevalent in Communist states. Filbinger's case sparks controversy even to this day. On 16 September 2003, a day after his 90th birthday, Filbinger was honoured by a reception at Ludwigsburg Palace. The 130 guests included most government ministers of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and his successors Lothar Sp√§th and Erwin Teufel. Protests accompanied the Ludwigsburg reception and had previously resulted in the cancelling in of a similar reception in Filbinger's home town Freiburg. Filbinger has been elected to the Federal Convention as a representative of Baden-W√ºrrtemberg's parliament in 1959, 1969, 1974, 1994, 1999, and 2004. The last occasion in 2004 caused controversy, as SPD, Greens, PDS, the German PEN and the Central Council of Jews in Germany protested this choice. However, on 31 March 2004, all candidates, including Filbinger, were unanimously confirmed by all parties in the state parliament, including the SPD and Green groupings. Filbinger died on 1 April 2007 in Freiburg im Breisgau. On 11 April 2007, G√ºnther Oettinger, at that time the Minister President of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, held a controversial eulogy during the memorial service for his predecessor. In his speech Oettinger described Filbinger as \\"not a National-Socialist\\" but \\"an opponent of the Nazi regime\\", who could flee the constraints of the regime as little as million others\\". About Filbinger's role as navy judge, Oettiner pointed out that no one lost his life because of a verdict by Filbinger and had not the power and freedom supposed by his critics.German fulltext of Oettinger's eulogy for Hans Filbinger (Microsoft Word document, 232 KB). Frankfurter Rundschau, 12 April 2007. Oettinger was subsequently accused by politicians and the media of diminishing the significance of the Nazi dictatorship. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reacted with public admonishment, stating that she would have preferred if \\"the critical questions\\" would have been raised.Nach umstrittener Trauerrede zu Filbinger: Merkel r√ºgt Oettinger. Tagesschau online, 13 April 2007. Oettinger was also criticized by opposition politicians and the Central Council of Jews; some of his critics even called for his demission. Oettinger at first defended his speech but added that he regretted any \\"misunderstanding\\" about his eulogy, but did not withdraw his comments on Filbinger's past.Eulogy for Former Nazi Prompts Criticism. New York Times, 14 April 2007 However, on April 16 he distanced himself from his comments.Oettingers Weltsicht.

He became famous in the late 1950s, playing under the pseudonym of Manuel and The Music of The Mountains. Early years Love was born in Todmorden, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, the only son and younger of two surviving children (an elder sister Cornelia) of African American Thomas Edward (Kidd) Love and his English wife, Frances Helen Maycock (1892‚Äì1975), an actress and singer. The Loves travelled around Britain as entertainers, but, following the death of his father, the family returned to their grandmother's house in Todmorden. Whilst at school, Love learned the trombone. After leaving school at 15, Love worked as a car mechanic and played trombone at dance halls in the evening. Having turned professional at 17, Love joined Freddie Platt's band. Later, in 1936, he joined Jan Ralfini's band playing in London and learned to play jazz. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Love was called up and joined the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Whilst in the armed forces, Love spent time learning orchestration by questioning musicians how best to write for their individual instruments. Love married Cicely Joyce Peters (known as Joy, 1923/4‚Äì1993) on 4 April 1942. She worked alongside Love, organising his recording sessions and accounts. They had two sons, Adrian (1944‚Äì1999), who became a well-known radio presenter, and Nigel (1948‚Äì2013). Post-war career Following his release from the army, Love became a freelance trombonist and arranger, and also played with Stanley Black's BBC orchestra. He also developed his orchestration through the tutelage of the harpist Marie Goossens. In the early 1950s, along with saxophonist Harry Gold, his brother Laurie Gold and pianist Norrie Paramor, Love was a member of the 'Pieces of Eight' playing Dixieland jazz. Although Love continued to play trombone at recording sessions (for example with bandleader Lew Stone), he was doing more and more orchestral arrangements. His arrangements were played by the Cliff Adams Singers, Ambrose and Ken Mackintosh dance bands, as well work for television and radio orchestras. By the mid-1950s Love was writing for several recording labels - moving from Philips to Polydor and PolyGram before finally settling at EMI. Whilst at the HMV label he arranged for Frankie Vaughan and Alma Cogan among others. Whilst working at Columbia, he arranged Laurie London's gospel song \\"He's Got the Whole World in His Hands\\", a 1957 chart topper in the US. In the late 1950s, playing under the pseudonym of 'Manuel and his Music of the Mountains', Love's created his Theme from Honeymoon (1959) which proved popular in the UK. His attempt to keep his identity secret whilst playing as 'Manuel' was impossible due to success, especially in the US in 1959 and 1960. In 1959 he and his orchestra recorded an album with British singer Shirley Bassey named The Fabulous Shirley Bassey. It was her first album for the Columbia label. In 1964, \\"Geoff Love's Music\\" backed the British rock duo Peter and Gordon on their first two hit singles (both written by Paul McCartney), the UK and US No. 1 hit \\"A World Without Love\\" and the top 15 hit \\"Nobody I Know\\". During the 1960s and into the 1970s, Love recorded many albums for MFP, often featuring film or television themes such as: Big Western Movie Themes (1969), Big War Movie Themes (1971), Big Suspense Movie Themes (1972), Your Top TV Themes (1972), Big Terror Movie Themes (1976) and other instrumental and disco music. Big Bond Movie Themes (1975) featuring a selection of instrumental versions of music and songs from the James Bond film series from Dr. No up to The Man with the Golden Gun (including Burt Bacharach's Casino Royale from the 1967 spoof Bond film) has since become one of Love's most sought after MFP albums. One of these MFP sets was called Glad with Love ‚Äì which featured the pianist Mrs Mills and Geoff Love on a sing-along together ‚Äì with studio audience participation. One of Love's most recognised arrangements was \\"Rodrigo's Guitar Concerto De Aranjuez (Theme From 2nd Movement)\\" by Manuel and the Music of the Mountains. This was announced as the number one single in the United Kingdom in February 1976 but the chart was withdrawn four hours later due to compilation errors, making it the shortest period that a song had been number one. He also made a very popular album of arrangements of Christmas Carols and Songs * Christmas with Love (1972) Love appeared on television with pianist Russ Conway and became well known for working alongside singer-comedian Max Bygraves. He was also a prolific composer, writing the theme music for the ITV sitcom Bless This House. Love also made some recordings as a vocalist. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. In the early 1980s, Love was the co-founder (with Bill Starling) of the Young Person's Concert Foundation. He travelled the country with this charity promoting music to schools and other venues. In the late 1980s, Love became involved with several brass bands. Awards Love's prolific career garnered one platinum, fifteen gold and thirteen silver discs, and a special trophy for selling in excess of 2¬Ω million records. Death Love died at the University College Hospital, Camden, London, on 8 July 1991 at the age of 73.

Herd was the Executive Vice President of World Championship Wrestling from 1988 to 1992 following Turner Broadcasting's acquisition of the National Wrestling Alliance-affiliated Jim Crockett Promotions in 1988. However, his tenure received much criticism from wrestlers and fans alike.  Early life and career  Before beginning his role in WCW, Herd had been a station manager for the St. Louis TV station KPLR-TV, which broadcast the then-popular wrestling show Wrestling at the Chase. Later on, he served as a regional manager for Pizza Hut.  World Championship Wrestling  Herd was hired as Executive Vice President of World Championship Wrestling in 1988, through his connections and friendship with Turner executive Jack Petrik. His tenure officially began on January 3, 1989. = Criticism = Many wrestling personalities, fans, and workers have openly criticized Herd for his lack of knowledge of the wrestling business and lack of respect for established wrestlers. Ric Flair in particular stated that Herd \\"knew nothing about wrestling, other than the fact that the station he ran had a hot show\\". During his run in WCW, Herd tried to compete with Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation by introducing the same kind of gimmicks that were a part of McMahon's WWF at the time, alienating the diehard NWA audience. For example, he once tried to come up with a tag team called The Hunchbacks (with the gimmick in which they could not be pinned because their humps would prevent their shoulders from touching the mats) and after that idea was rejected by the booking committee he came up with the bell-wearing team, The Ding Dongs (portrayed by The Rock n Roll Rebels). After that, he came up with Big Josh, a lumberjack who was accompanied by dancing bears. Stan Hansen left the organization to return to All Japan Pro Wrestling after the idea was pitched to him to become a part of the comedic cowboy stable called The Desperados. Jim Cornette and Stan Lane also left the organization in October 1990, breaking up the Midnight Express and leaving Bobby Eaton on his own, after Herd would blame his many failures on Cornette and others. Even The Road Warriors, as Animal has stated on WWE Home Video's Road Warriors DVD, had a fallout with Herd as well and resigned from WCW in June 1990. = Feud with Ric Flair = Herd regularly clashed with the then NWA World Heavyweight Champion and booking committee member Ric Flair. According to Flair, Herd wanted him to drop his entire \\"Nature Boy\\" persona, cut his signature bleached blond hair, and adopt a Roman gladiator gimmick by the name of Spartacus in order to \\"change with the times\\". This did not sit well with Flair and the committee (committee member Kevin Sullivan was quoted as saying: \\"While we're doing this, why don't we go to Yankee Stadium and change Babe Ruth's number?\\"). Herd believed Flair's time was over as a main event player and the big money was with Sting and Lex Luger. This backstage feud hit its breaking point when during contract renegotiation Flair refused to take a pay cut and he moved away from the main event position as he was by far the company's biggest draw. He also refused to drop the title to Luger as Herd wanted, saying that he had promised to drop it to Sting and Herd had previously agreed. Herd did not care what he had said earlier and accused Flair of holding up the company, but Flair said he was simply holding Herd to his word. Flair tried to compromise with Herd and offered to drop the title to fellow Horsemen Barry Windham, feeling that Windham was long passed over and deserved a run with the title. However, as Flair was planning to leave to wrestle Windham so he could lose the title, on July 1, 1991, two weeks before the Great American Bash, Herd fired Flair from WCW and stripped him of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. However, Flair was still in possession of the physical championship belt. = Flair brings the belt to WWF's TV programs = Upon notification, Flair called Vince McMahon of the rival World Wrestling Federation to inform him of the situation. McMahon offered Flair a deal with the WWF in exchange for him sending McMahon the belt and Flair obliged. A couple of weeks later, promos were being shown of Bobby Heenan with Flair's belt on WWF television. NWA and WCW officials expressed frustration at Herd's actions and amidst loud \\"We Want Flair!\\" chants at WCW events during this period made a final attempt to save face by offering Flair substantially more money to return, but their efforts failed.  Legacy and aftermath  Many wrestling insiders look at this incident as the major reason why Vince McMahon took the WWF Championship title belt off of the soon-to-be departing Bret Hart at the 1997 Survivor Series event in the infamous Montreal Screwjob in order to avoid it being shown on rival WCW's Monday Nitro show the following day (a similar incident occurred in December 1995 when Madusa Miceli came out with the WWF Women's title belt on WCW Monday Nitro and threw it in the trash can). Many felt that his company, who was losing the ratings war to WCW at the time, simply could not afford the same public relations nightmare that had befallen the NWA back in 1991 and took extreme measures to prevent it by ordering the referee (Earl Hebner) to call for the bell seconds after Shawn Michaels put Hart in a sharpshooter submission hold and awarding the belt to Michaels. The matter with Flair caused a lawsuit between the two companies, but eventually the lawsuit was dropped. In the 2008 WWE DVD Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection, Flair said he kept the \\"Big Gold Belt\\" because he was never paid back his $25,000 initial deposit for the NWA title, plus interest, which totaled $38,000. Herd resigned from WCW on January 8, 1992 and was replaced by Kip Allen Frey.  References   External links * Gold Heist!

Wasson, written by Jim L. Ball and Mike Williams, and starring Michael Cutt, Jody Lazarus, Michael Lang, and Melanie Graham. The film centers on an anthropologist who, along with a group of his pupils, embarks on an expedition to prove the existence of Bigfoot in a rural region of Northern California, only to be stalked and systematically slaughtered by the creature. Due to the film's graphic violence, it was listed as a \\"video nasty\\" by the British Board of Film Classification, and underwent heavy censorship.  Plot  Bill Nugent, an anthropology professor, is approached by Carla Thomas, a young woman whose father was murdered in the woods in Northern California. She suspects that his death was caused by a Bigfoot who, according to legend, resides in the woods in the region. Despite a number of disappearances and brutal murdersincluding the death of a young couple, the manual emasculation of a biker, and the butchering of two Girl Scoutspolice have deemed the theory of a Bigfoot being responsible a hoax. Carla requests to accompany Bill along with four of his studentsRoy, Pete, Gary, and Lindaon an expedition aiming to prove Bigfoot's existence. They embark by boat along a river, and first camp on the property of an elderly man, Lou Carlson, who has claimed to witness the Bigfoot. Lou allows them to stay but is evasive when they attempt to speak to him. When one of the students, Roy, bribes Lou with alcohol, Lou suggests they seek out Wanda, a recluse who resides deep in the woods, and supposedly holds more information about the Bigfoot. Meanwhile, a hunter camping nearby is attacked and impaled by the Bigfoot on a jagged branch. The next day, Nugent and his five companions visit the nearby town, where they glean from locals more information about Wanda: She is the daughter of a deranged preacher, Emmet McGinty, whose followers were rumored to engage in inbreeding, cannibalism, and human sacrifice. Emmet has since committed suicide. After learning of this, the group returns to the woods. That night, after the five have fallen asleep, they are awoken by the sound of chanting. Bill and Roy follow the sound, and stumble upon a Satanic sexual ritual involving Wanda around an effigy of Bigfoot; among the practitioners is a local sheriff. Bill interrupts the ritual by firing a gun, causing the cultists to scatter. In the morning, Bill and the others find their boat missing, and large footprints left on the shore. After making plaster casts of the footprints, they push onward. That night, the Bigfoot attacks Linda and Gary while the two have sex, but they survive. The group eventually reach Wanda's cabin, bribing her with candy, but she has a nervous breakdown when the Bigfoot is mentioned. That night, Pete is attacked by the Bigfoot, who causes him to shoot himself with his rifle. The others attempt to locate Pete, but find he has disappeared. Bill decides to hypnotize Wanda the next day, causing her to recall her abusive childhood: As a teenager, Wanda was raped by the Bigfoot, an event her religious fanatic father, Emmet, witnessed in horror, convinced the beast was a demon. Emmet unsuccessfully attempted to induce an abortion by forcing Wanda to drink poison. Wanda eventually gave birth to the mutant half-human child, but Emmet killed it moments after its birth. In retaliation, Wanda burned her father alive in his barn, staging it to look like a suicide. Hoping to find evidence of Wanda's Bigfoot child, Bill explores a cemetery nearby, where he digs up the skeletal remains of the infant Bigfoot, which appear to be more animal than human. The Bigfoot appears in the cemetery, and absconds with its dead spawn as Bill and the others fearfully barricade themselves in Wanda's cabin. Hours later, the Bigfoot hangs Pete's mutilated body on the porch before breaking into the home. Ignoring a dissonantly calm Wanda, the Bigfoot strangles Carla to death as the others barricade themselves in the kitchen. The Bigfoot breaks into the kitchen, where he disembowels Gary. Roy attempts to stop him, but the Bigfoot smashes his head through the window and cuts his throat on the glass, before impaling Linda with a pitchfork. Finally, the Bigfoot burns Bill's face on the hot stove, leaving him for dead. Some time later, Bill lies helplessly in a hospital bed, having been found unconscious in the woods, his face horribly burned. When detectives inquire about Carla and the four students, all of whom are missing, Bill recounts his version of events to them. Both the police and attending doctors receive his story with disbelief, and the hospital psychologist deems him criminally insane.  Cast   Release  =Censorship= Due its depiction of brutal violence Night of the Demon was listed as a \\"video nasty\\" by the British Board of Film Classification. It remained banned in the United Kingdom until January 1994, when VIPCO resubmitted it to the BBFC, who agreed to pass it with an 18 certificate as long as one minute and forty-one seconds' worth of gore was deleted. Almost all of the violent scenes were trimmed, but the castration of the biker and the removal of a student's intestines (for use as a flail) were removed completely. =Home media= The film was released on VHS by Vipco on September 13, 1993. It was later released for the first time on DVD by Black Horse on November 1, 2004 and by Vidtape on November 30 that same year. Code Red released the film as a part of its Maria's \\"B\\" Movie Mayhem series on October 11, 2011. It was last released by Mr Fat - W Video on June 21, 2016.  Reception  Devon Bertsch of Digital Retribution wrote, \\"When the Bigfoot is off screen, it is admittedly hard to overlook the film's many, many flaws. Indeed everything that is not the Bigfoot is highly flawed, and even the Bigfoot himself looks pretty crap. The acting, script, FX and the often incongruous score are laughable, but add to the film's wacko charm.\\" A 2¬Ω out of 5 was given to the film by Justin Kerswell of Hysteria Lives!, who called it \\"undoubtedly the best of the worst of the early 80s backwoods slashers\\". Dread Central's Chris Haberman stated, \\"Is this a 'so-bad-it's-good' movie? No. This is one of those rare, largely forgotten films that was taken so seriously by its creators that it is difficult to imagine a large team of people reading the script, enjoying it, coming on-board, and putting in the time and energy to bring the terrible story to life. As such, this is an 'I-must-have-a-fever' movie, because most of what you'll see may feel like a hallucination\\" and \\"The film has plenty of problems, but I think the reason its supporters still stand beside this freakshow is that the film works hard to entertain. No matter how clumsy the dialogue and effects may be, these cats were trying to be taken seriously, and the result is too angry and depraved to be considered a lazy cash-in or mocking parody piece. The filmmakers' intention to make an earnestly mean and perverted film is undeniable, and that weird essence turns even the most absurdly executed set pieces into memorable mindfuckers\\".

The program is also aired on CNN Brazil from March 16, 2020, and CNN Philippines via tape-delay on an occasional basis since August 20, 2016, when Philippine affairs in terms of global context are tackled by the show. The program relaunched full-time on the channel in 2018. Format The weekday program has three segments. The first is called \\"The Brief\\", in which Amanpour tells a story from a different perspective, and often adds her personal experiences. The second segment is typically an interview with a high profile news maker or politician, while the final segment is called \\"Imagine a World\\", which is Amanpour's final thought on a topic that was not discussed on the show. When Amanpour is reporting in the field, she anchors the entire program remotely. =Interviews= The show has featured a number of high-profile interviews, including Joko Widodo, Robert Mugabe, Jacob Zuma, Queen Rania of Jordan, Son of Hamas author Mosab Hassan Yousef, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak, a rare joint interview with Sec. of State Hillary Clinton and Sec. of Defense Bob Gates, an unprecedented joint interview with the U.N. Ambassadors to India, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Mohamed ElBaradei, Hans Blix, NATO Secretary General Rasmussen, Gen. McChrystal, the first-ever joint interview with media power couple Tina Brown and Harold Evans, Gen. David Petraeus, and the then Vice President, now former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan. History Amanpour debuted on September 21, 2009 on CNN International. It airs weekdays on CNN International and Sundays on CNN/US. The show's first run ended in April 2010 after Amanpour departed CNN to host This Week on American network ABC. Upon her return to the network in 2011, CNN International relaunched Amanpour. The series returned on April 16, 2012 and airs weekdays in the afternoon in North America and during primetime in Europe. In November 2015, Amanpour. began airing on CNN in the US on weekdays. In August 20, 2016, Amanpour was also aired on CNN Philippines via tape-delay as a dry-run, but was axed a week after premiering on the network's local programming for unknown reasons. It eventually returned on August 31, 2016, albeit the program would broadcast on an occasional basis when Philippine affairs that affect the global stage are featured. The program relaunched full-time by January 1, 2018, replacing timeslots formerly occupied by the local franchise's Global Newsroom and the early evening edition of Sports Desk (both were axed due to network reorganization); thus extending its coverage to other international issues which were formerly featured in the former. On December 4, 2017, it was announced that Amanpour would re-air on PBS as an interim replacement for Charlie Rose, after allegations of sexual harassment against Rose led to his program's cancellation. The show on PBS was branded as Amanpour on PBS. On May 8, 2018, PBS confirmed that the show, retitled Amanpour & Company, would be the official replacement to Charlie Rose and the new show began airing on September 10, 2018. Christiane Amanpour won Television Personality of the Year for the show in 2015 at the AIB Media Excellence Awards. She also won at the Gracie Awards in 2016 for best Talk Show - News. On September 10, 2018, as part of a revamp of CNN International's European primetime line-up, Amanpour moved to the 19.00 CET/18.00 UK timeslot and expanded to be a one-hour show. On March 16, 2020, the program started its daily broadcast on CNN Brazil, with Portuguese subtitles.  Reception  Amanpour has received generally positive reviews from television critics and parents of young children.

Career management was first defined in a social work doctoral thesis by Mary Valentich as the implementation of a career strategy through application of career tactics in relation to chosen career orientation (Valentich & Gripton, 1978). Career orientation referred to the overall design or pattern of one's career, shaped by particular goals and interests and identifiable by particular positions that embody these goals and interests. Career strategy pertains to the individual's general approach to the realization of career goals, and to the specificity of the goals themselves. Two general strategy approaches are adaptive and planned. Career tactics are actions to maintain oneself in a satisfactory employment situation. Tactics may be more or less assertive, with assertiveness in the work situation referring to actions taken to advance one's career interests or to exercise one's legitimate rights while respecting the rights of others. Valentich and Gripton defined success as managing one's career effectively through the attainment of desired positions and other rewards. The outcome of successful career management should include personal fulfillment, work/life balance, goal achievement and financial security. A career includes all types of employment ranging from semi-skilled through skilled, and semi professional to professional. Careers have often been restricted to an employment commitment to a single trade skill, profession or business firm for the entire working life of a person. In recent years, however, a career now includes changes or modifications in employment during the foreseeable future. The following classification system with minor variations is widely used: # Development of overall goals and objectives, # Development of a strategy (a general means to accomplish the selected goals/objectives), # Development of the specific means (policies, rules, procedures and activities) to implement the strategy, and #Systematic evaluation of the progress toward the achievement of the selected goals/objectives to modify the strategy, if necessary. Goals or objectives development The career management process begins with setting goals/objectives. A relatively specific goal/objective must be formulated. This task may be quite difficult when the individual lacks knowledge of career opportunities and/or is not fully aware of their talents and abilities. However, the entire career management process is based on the establishment of defined goals/objectives whether specific or general in nature. Utilizing career assessments may be a critical step in identifying opportunities and career paths that most resonate with someone. Career assessments can range from quick and informal to more indepth. Regardless of the ones you use, you will need to evaluate them. Most assessments found today for free (although good) do not offer an in-depth evaluation. The time horizon for the achievement of the selected goals or objectives - short term, medium term or long term - will have a major influence on their formulation. # Short-term goals (one or two years) are usually specific and limited in scope. Short-term goals are easier to formulate. Make sure they are achievable and relate to your longer term career goals. # Intermediate goals (3 to 20 years) tend to be less specific and more open ended than short-term goals. Both intermediate and long-term goals are more difficult to formulate than short-term goals because there are so many unknowns about the future. # Long-term goals (Over 20 years), of course, are the most fluid of all. Lack of life experience and knowledge about potential opportunities and pitfalls make the formulation of long-term goals/objectives very difficult. Long-range goals/objectives, however, may be easily modified as additional information is received without a great loss of career efforts because of experience/knowledge transfer from one career to another. # Making career choices and decisions - the traditional focus of careers interventions. The changed nature of work means that individuals may now have to revisit this process more frequently now and in the future, more than in the past. # Managing the organizational career - concerns the career management tasks of individuals within the workplace, such as decision-making, life-stage transitions, dealing with stress etc. # Managing 'boundaryless' careers - refers to skills needed by workers whose employment is beyond the boundaries of a single organization, a workstyle common among, for example, artists and designers. # Taking control of one's personal development - as employers take less responsibility, employees need to take control of their own development in order to maintain and enhance their employability. Other elements include: * Career change Career planning Career planning is a subset of career management. Career planning applies the concepts of Strategic planning and Marketing to taking charge of one's professional future. Career is an ongoing process and so it needs to be assessed on continuous basis. This process of re-assessing individual learning and development over a period of time is called Career Planning. According to Mondy and Noe - \\" Career planning is an ongoing process whereby an individual sets career goals and identifies the means to achieve them.\\" Importance of career planning It is important to come up with your career planning as it gives you the much needed direction and makes it clear there where you see yourself in future. It makes you aware of your strength and weaknesses and the skills and knowledge that are required to achieve your goals in future. A large proportion of our life is spent in achieving our career goals, thus it is very important to make sure that right steps were taken and correct planning was done in the early years of your life. There are very few lucky ones who are born with a clear mind and who knows what they want to do and where they see themselves in life ahead. But majority of us are not sure what we want from life and so it in very important to plan out things. Thus career planning is what gives your career and in some way your life, true meaning and purpose. Human life is the brilliant life and career play vital role in it. In short without a career in your life is useless.https://quotesnmotivation.blogspot.com/2020/09/How%20to%20pick%20a%20career.html?m=1 Process of career planning The process of career planning is also known as career development stages and career development model. These steps help you in planning your career and deciding about your future.The Career Planning Process, Planning Your Career Step-By-Step, By Dawn Rosenberg McKay http://careerplanning.about.com/cs/choosingacareer/a/cp_process.htm * Self- development Once you have self-analyzed yourself, the second step that awaits your attention is to fill the loopholes you have identified in the above step. By this we mean that in this step you have to see that what are the qualities and skills that are required by you to help you achieve your aims and goals. For instance you might decide that you need training or a particular course in a field in order to make you perfect for the profession you have chosen.http://www.careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au/careerplanning/Pages/CareerPlanning-4StepPlanningProcess.aspx It could be that you are interested in painting but you are not much aware of the trends or the knowledge that is required for this field. Or there can be a case where you are interested and much aware about a profession like teaching but you do not yet know that what is the niche level that is meant for you like and the subjects you can carry off pretty well. * A thorough research self-development Once you have listed the careers that are favorable in your case and the skills and improvements that are required by you in order to achieve excellence the third step requires you to do an intensive research and see that what that are findings related to career options and the skills that are required to make you champion in that. You research will be looking into following questions: *What is the scope of the career you have chosen? *Will that career pay you off in the future? *Is there room for expansion in that career field? * Come up with action form Once you have researched the feasibility of the factors that you have finalized in above steps, the next step is to show some action and translate your plans on a piece of page. This step requires you to make plan as in how you are going to achieve and fulfill the steps you have decided above. The best way to come with an action plan is to come up with small goals for oneself. Once these small goals are achieved, we can see that how much close we are to our main aim and major goal. This small step acts as a path way to the main aim. * Action Once you are done with small goals and the main aim, the next step remains to start implementing your plans. Keep a very close track of your activities to make sure that you are on the right track and that by following this path you are surely going to achieve you goal!

Starring Bernice Stegers, Philip Sayer, and Simon Nash, the film focuses on a father who was abducted by aliens and returns to his family three years later, where he goes in search of his son. Production of the film started and completed in February 1982. The film was released in the United Kingdom in December 1982, and in January 1983 in the United States. While reception to the film is mostly negative, the film has achieved a cult status since its release. Plot As Sam Phillips and his son Tony are playing outside their farm, Sam is suddenly abducted by a bright light. Three years later, the light returns and plants a seed. A half-human, half-alien creature develops from the seed, and is hit by a car; the couple in the car are soon killed. The creature then goes to a cottage nearby, where it attacks and impregnates the young woman living there before dissolving. When she awakens later, her belly rapidly grows to a gargantuan size until she gives birth to a fully formed Sam, killing her. Sam washes himself, steals the driver's clothes and leaves in the car. Sam seeks out Tony, who lives in an apartment building in London with his mother Rachel, her new boyfriend Joe Daniels, and French au-pair Analise Mercier. Tony has recurring nightmares where he wakes up soaked in another person's blood. Sam picks Tony up from school and is found by Rachel. Despite Joe's consternation Sam goes to live with the family, claiming that he can't remember anything. After Tony sees Sam eating the eggs of his pet snake, Sam comforts him and drinks his blood. Tony soon discovers he has paranormal powers, which he uses to send a human-sized toy soldier to slaughter a neighbor who killed his snake and to bring a toy clown to life. Sam and Rachel visit the farm where they used to live, leaving Tony in Analise's care. During a game of hide-and-seek with Tony, Analise is knocked out by the clown and used as a womb for the alien eggs. Tony sends a toy tank to attack her boyfriend Michael, who is killed by a panther as he tries to flee. Meanwhile, while Sam and Rachel make love at the farm, his skin starts to bleed and decompose. Joe takes Tony to the farm, where Sam takes his son up a hill towards the alien light. Sam, now taking the form of an alien, uses his scream to kill Joe. Sam and Tony enter the light and return to the alien world, leaving Rachel behind. Arriving at home the next day, Rachel finds the apartment full of eggs. As she picks up an egg, Rachel is killed by a newborn creature. =Alternate ending= Director Harry Bromley Davenport originally intended the film to end with Rachel coming home to find the apartment filled with clones of Tony, having apparently come from the alien eggs which the real Tony had left in the refrigerator. Executive producer Robert Shaye, not thinking the scene's special effects were convincing enough, edited it out and released it for its New York debut with the film ending when Rachel sits down in the field after Sam and Tony have left. Davenport, however, not wanting to have it end on such an abrupt note, created another ending which had Rachel going back to the apartment, picking up one of the eggs, and being attacked by a face-grabbing creature similar to the one that attacked the woman in the cottage. The UK 2018 Blu-Ray release of Xtro included this ending.

It was released on DVD three times in the US by Image Entertainment. The first DVD was released in 2005 as a double feature with sequel Xtro II: The Second Encounter. The second was released in 2006 as a standalone release. The third, released in 2007, was a triple feature alongside Xtro II: The Second Encounter and Skeeter. In the UK, the Xtro trilogy was released in box-set, remastered anamorphic widescreen with 5.1 for Xtro II and an interview with director Harry Bromley Davenport covering the production of all three films. It has since then been out of print. It has been re-released on blu-ray format in the UK in October 2018 by Second Sight, with several featurettes and alternate endings and cuts of the film.  Critical reception  Critical reception for the film has been negative. Currently, it holds a 43% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5/10 based on 7 reviews. Roger Ebert panned the film, awarding it 1 of 4 stars, calling the film \\"ugly\\" and \\"despairing\\" and further commenting, \\"Most exploitation movies are bad, but not necessarily painful to watch. They may be incompetent, they may be predictable, they may be badly acted or awkwardly directed, but at some level the filmmakers are enjoying themselves and at least trying to entertain an audience. 'Xtro' is an exception, a completely depressing, nihilistic film, an exercise in sadness ‚Ä¶ It's movies like this that give movies a bad name\\". TV Guide awarded the film 0 of 4 stars, calling the film, \\"A vile exercise in grotesque special effects\\" and \\"an excuse to parade all manner of perversities across the screen\\", further stating that, \\"Not only is this disgusting, it lacks anything that remotely resembles suspense\\". Horror View.com gave the film a mostly negative review, commenting, \\"Great plot line for a horror [film] but it never really lives up to the potential, mostly because of extremely low budget nature and a seemingly underworked or plain ol' substandard script. But Xtro does still have a few impressive scenes and some truly bizarre ideas\\". AllMovie called the movie \\"pure trash\\" that was \\"made to capitalize on public interest in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" and \\"basically presents the gory, sexy exploitation- movie take on that film's 'alien visits Earth' premise.\\" The film has garnered more praise in recent years, however. RedLetterMedia lauded Xtro for its screenwriting and use of practical effects in their Best of the Worst show after accidentally choosing it from a lineup of B movies they believed would all be of poor quality. Having previously watched many similar movies cheaply capitalizing on the genre, Mike Stoklasa called the movie \\"a masterpiece\\" by comparison. Sequels Director Harry Bromley Davenport made two sequels to the film, Xtro II: The Second Encounter and Xtro 3: Watch the Skies. Neither film had anything to do with the original film. In March 2011, Davenport confirmed that Xtro 4 was in the works. Speaking to Fangoria.com, he stated: > ‚ÄúI am going to be starting XTRO 4 this summer; you are the first to receive > this shattering news,‚Äù Davenport tells us. ‚ÄúA script by Daryl Haney is in > the works, and my sales guys are salivating.

As in Western illuminated manuscripts, exquisitely decorated borders were an integral part of the work of art. A Persian miniature (Persian: ŸÜ⁄Øÿßÿ±⁄Øÿ±€å ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å neg√¢rgari Ir√¢ni) is a small Persian painting on paper, whether a book illustration or a separate work of art intended to be kept in an album of such works called a muraqqa. The techniques are broadly comparable to the Western Medieval and Byzantine traditions of miniatures in illuminated manuscripts. Although there is an equally well-established Persian tradition of wall-painting, the survival rate and state of preservation of miniatures is better, and miniatures are much the best-known form of Persian painting in the West, and many of the most important examples are in Western, or Turkish, museums. Miniature painting became a significant genre in Persian art in the 13th century, receiving Chinese influence after the Mongol conquests, and the highest point in the tradition was reached in the 15th and 16th centuries. The tradition continued, under some Western influence, after this, and has many modern exponents. The Persian miniature was the dominant influence on other Islamic miniature traditions, principally the Ottoman miniature in Turkey, and the Mughal miniature in the Indian sub-continent. Persian art under Islam had never completely forbidden the human figure, and in the miniature tradition the depiction of figures, often in large numbers, is central. This was partly because the miniature is a private form, kept in a book or album and only shown to those the owner chooses. It was therefore possible to be more free than in wall paintings or other works seen by a wider audience. The Quran and other purely religious works are not known to have been illustrated in this way, though histories and other works of literature may include religiously related scenes, including those depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, after 1500 usually without showing his face.Gruber, throughout; see Welch, 95-97 for one of the most famous examples, illustrated below A rare pure landscape, with a river, Tabriz (?), 1st quarter of 14th century As well as the figurative scenes in miniatures, which this article concentrates on, there was a parallel style of non-figurative ornamental decoration which was found in borders and panels in miniature pages, and spaces at the start or end of a work or section, and often in whole pages acting as frontispieces. In Islamic art this is referred to as \\"illumination\\", and manuscripts of the Quran and other religious books often included considerable number of illuminated pages.In the terminology of Western illuminated manuscripts, \\"illumination\\" usually covers both narrative scenes and decorative elements. The designs reflected contemporary work in other media, in later periods being especially close to book-covers and Persian carpets, and it is thought that many carpet designs were created by court artists and sent to the workshops in the provinces.Canby (2009), 83 In later periods miniatures were increasingly created as single works to be included in albums called muraqqa, rather than illustrated books. This allowed non-royal collectors to afford a representative sample of works from different styles and periods. Style Camp scene from late in the classic period, with no frame (c. 1556-1565), Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Majnun (at top wearing orange) spies on his beloved Layla (standing in tent doorway). The bright and pure colouring of the Persian miniature is one of its most striking features. Normally all the pigments used are mineral-based ones which keep their bright colours very well if kept in proper conditions, the main exception being silver, mostly used to depict water, which will oxidize to a rough-edged black over time.Gray (1930), 22-23 The conventions of Persian miniatures changed slowly; faces are normally youthful and seen in three-quarters view, with a plump rounded lower face better suited to portraying typical Central Asian or Chinese features than those of most Persians. Lighting is even, without shadows or chiaroscuro. Walls and other surfaces are shown either frontally, or as at (to modern eyes) an angle of about 45 degrees, often giving the modern viewer the unintended impression that a building is (say) hexagonal in plan. Buildings are often shown in complex views, mixing interior views through windows or \\"cutaways\\" with exterior views of other parts of a facade. Costumes and architecture are always those of the time.Gray (1930), 22-28; Welch, 35 Many figures are often depicted, with those in the main scene normally rendered at the same size, and recession (depth in the picture space) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space. More important figures may be somewhat larger than those around them, and battle scenes can be very crowded indeed. Great attention is paid to the background, whether of a landscape or buildings, and the detail and freshness with which plants and animals, the fabrics of tents, hangings or carpets, or tile patterns are shown is one of the great attractions of the form. The dress of figures is equally shown with great care, although artists understandably often avoid depicting the patterned cloth that many would have worn. Animals, especially the horses that very often appear, are mostly shown sideways on; even the love-stories that constitute much of the classic material illustrated are conducted largely in the saddle, as far as the prince-protagonist is concerned.Gray (1930), 25-26, 44-50 Landscapes are very often mountainous (the plains that make up much of Persia are rarely attempted), this being indicated by a high undulating horizon, and outcrops of bare rock which, like the clouds in the normally small area of sky left above the landscape, are depicted in conventions derived from Chinese art. Even when a scene in a palace is shown, the viewpoint often appears to be from a point some metres in the air.Gray (1930), 25-26, 48-49, 64 The earliest miniatures appeared unframed horizontally across the page in the middle of text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the vertical format was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings. This is used in all the luxury manuscripts for the court that constitute the most famous Persian manuscripts, and the vertical format dictates many characteristics of the style.Sims Saki, album miniature by Reza Abbasi, 1609 The miniatures normally occupy a full page, later sometimes spreading across two pages to regain a square or horizontal \\"landscape\\" format. There are often panels of text or captions inside the picture area, which is enclosed in a frame, eventually of several ruled lines with a broader band of gold or colour. The rest of the page is often decorated with dense designs of plants and animals in a muted grisaille, often gold and brown; text pages without miniatures often also have such borders. In later manuscripts, elements of the miniature begin to expand beyond the frame, which may disappear on one side of the image, or be omitted completely.OAO (3, ii and elsewhere) Another later development was the album miniature, conceived as a single picture rather than a book illustration, though such images may be accompanied by short lyric poems. The withdrawal of Shah Tahmasp I from commissioning illustrated books in the 1540s probably encouraged artists to transfer to these cheaper works for a wider circle of patrons.Brend, 164-165 Albums or muraqqas were assembled by collectors with album miniatures, specimen pages of calligraphy, and miniatures taken from older books, to which border paintings were often added when they were remounted. Album miniatures usually showed a few figures on a larger scale, with less attention to the background, and tended to become drawings with some tints of coloured wash, rather than fully painted. In the example at right the clothes are fully painted, and the background uses the gold grisaille style earlier reserved for marginal decoration, as in the miniature at the head of the article. Many were individual portraits, either of notable figures (but initially rarely portraits of rulers), or of idealized beautiful youths. Others were scenes of lovers in a garden or picnics. From about the middle of the 16th century these types of images became dominant, but they gradually declined in quality and originality and tended towards conventional prettiness and sentimentality.OAO, Sims; Gray (1930), 74-81 Books were sometimes refurbished and added to after an interval of many years, adding or partly repainting miniatures, changing the border decoration, and making other changes, not all improvements.OAO The Conference of the Birds miniature in the gallery below is an addition of 1600 to a manuscript of over a century earlier, and elements of the style appear to represent an effort to match the earlier miniatures in the book.Metropolitan Museum of Art \\"The Conference of the Birds\\": Page from a manuscript of the Mantiq al-Tayr (The Language of the Birds) of Farid al-Din cAttar, Isfahan (63.210.11).

The famous painting Princes of the House of Timur was first painted in 1550-55 in Persia for the exiled Mughal prince Humayun, who largely began the Mughal miniature tradition by taking back Persian miniaturists when he gained the throne. It was then twice updated in India (c.1605 and 1628) to show later generations of the royal house.Crill and Jarilwala, 50-51; Art Fund with image. The painting uses miniature techniques on cotton, and is much larger than most miniatures. The dimensions of the manuscripts covered a range not dissimilar to typical modern books, though with a more vertical ratio; many were as small as a modern paperback, others larger. Shah Tamasp's Shahnameh stood 47 cm high, and one exceptional Shahnameh from Tabriz of c. 1585 stood 53 cm high.Uluc, 73 Artists and technique Complex palace scene, 1539‚Äì1543, Mir Sayyid Ali In the classic period artists were exclusively male, and normally grouped in workshops, of which the royal workshop (not necessarily in a single building) was much the most prestigious, recruiting talented artists from the bazaar workshops in the major cities. However the nature of the royal workshop remains unclear, as some manuscripts are recorded as being worked on in different cities, rulers often took artists with them on their travels, and at least some artists were able to work on private commissions.Roxburgh (2000), 6-8 As in Europe, sons very often followed their father into the workshop, but boys showing talent from any background might be recruited; at least one notable painter was born a slave. There were some highly placed amateur artists, including Shah Tahmasp I (reigned 1524‚Äì1576), who was also one of the greatest patrons of miniatures. Persian artists were highly sought after by other Islamic courts, especially those of the Ottoman and Mughal Empires, whose own traditions of miniature were based on Persian painting but developed rather different styles.Welch, 12-14 The work was often divided between the main painter, who drew the outlines, and less senior painters who coloured in the drawing. In Mughal miniatures at least, a third artist might do just the faces. Then there might be the border paintings; in most books using them these are by far the largest area of painted material as they occur on text pages as well. The miniatures in a book were often divided up between different artists, so that the best manuscripts represent an overview of the finest work of the period. The scribes or calligraphers were normally different people, on the whole regarded as having a rather higher status than the artists - their names are more likely to be noted in the manuscript. Royal librarians probably played a significant role in managing the commissions; the extent of direct involvement by the ruler himself is normally unclear. The scribes wrote the main text first, leaving spaces for the miniatures, presumably having made a plan for these with the artist and the librarian. The book covers were also richly decorated for luxury manuscripts, and when they too have figurative scenes these presumably used drawings by the same artists who created the miniatures. Paper was the normal material for the pages, unlike the vellum normally used in Europe for as long as the illuminated manuscript tradition lasted. The paper was highly polished, and when not given painted borders might be flecked with gold leaf.Gray (1930), 22-26; Welch, 12-14 A unique survival from the Timurid period, found \\"pasted inconspicuously\\" in a muraqqa in the Topkapi Palace is thought to be a report to Baysunghur from his librarian. After a brief and high-flown introduction, \\"Petition from the most humble servants of the royal library, whose eyes are as expectant of the dust from the hooves of the regal steed as the ears of those who fast are for the cry of Allahu akbar ...\\" it continues with very businesslike and detailed notes on what each of some twenty-five named artists, scribes and craftsmen has been up to over a period of perhaps a week: \\"Amir Khalil has finished the waves in two sea- scenes of the Gulistan and will begin to apply colour. ... All the painters are working on painting and tinting seventy-five tent-poles .... Mawlana Ali is designing a frontispiece illumination for the Shahnama. His eyes were sore for a few days.\\"Thackston, 43-44 Apart from book arts, designs for tent- makers, tile-makers, woodwork and a saddle are mentioned, as is the progress of the \\"begim's little chest\\".Thackston, 43-44; a good number of those named are mentioned in other sources.  History  The Mi'raj (also called the \\"Night Ride\\") of Muhammed on Buraq, Tabriz, 1307; Ilkhanid, with both Christian and Chinese influences, and horizontal format. Demotte or \\"Great Mongol Shahnameh\\", a key Ilkhanid work, 1330s? The ancient Persian religion of Manichaeism made considerable use of images; not only was the founding prophet Mani (c.216‚Äì276) a professional artist, at least according to later Islamic tradition, but one of the sacred books of the religion, the Arzhang, was illustrated by the prophet himself, whose illustrations (probably essentially cosmological diagrams rather than images with figures) were regarded as part of the sacred material and always copied with the text. Unfortunately, the religion was repressed strongly from the Sassanid era and onwards so that only tiny fragments of Manichean art survive. These no doubt influenced the continuing Persian tradition, but little can be said about how. It is also known that Sassanid palaces had wall-paintings, but only fragments of these have survived.Gray (1930), 27-28 There are narrative scenes in pottery, though it is hard to judge how these relate to lost contemporary book painting.Sims Recent scholarship has noted that, although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was also a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts (such as literature, science, and history); as early as the 9th century, such art flourished during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749-1258, across Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Mesopotamia, and Persia). The great period of the Persian miniature began when Persia was ruled by a succession of foreign dynasties, who came from the east and north. The traumatic Mongol invasion of 1219 onwards established the Ilkhanate as a branch of the Mongol Empire, and despite the huge destruction of life and property, the new court had a galvanising effect on book painting, importing many Chinese works and probably artists, with their long-established tradition of narrative painting. The Ilkhanids continued to migrate between summer and winter quarters, which together with other travels for war, hunting and administration, made the portable form of the illustrated book the most suitable vehicle for painting, as it also was for mobile European medieval rulers.Sims The Great Mongol Shahnameh, now dispersed, is the outstanding manuscript of the period.Canby (1993), 33-34 After 1335 the Ilkhanate split into several warring dynasties, all swept aside by the new invasion of Timur from 1381. He established the Timurid dynasty, bringing a fresh wave of Chinese influence, who were replaced by the Black Sheep Turkmen in 1452, followed by the White Sheep Turkmen from 1468, who were in turn replaced by the Safavid dynasty by 1501; they ruled until 1722. After a chaotic period Nader Shah took control, but there was no long-lived dynasty until the Qajar dynasty, who ruled from 1794 to 1925.Gray (1976), 309-315, OAO; Rawson, 146-147 Baysonghor Shahnameh, 1430. He was a key patron of the Herat school It was only in the 14th century that the practice began of commissioning illustrated copies of classic works of Persian poetry, above all the Shahnameh of Ferdowsi (940-1020) and the Khamsa of Nizami, which were to contain many of the finest miniatures. Previously book illustration, of works in both Arabic and Persian, had been concentrated in practical and scientific treatises, often following at several removes the Byzantine miniatures copied when ancient Greek books were translated.Gray (1976), 310-311 However a 14th- century flowering of Arabic illustrated literary manuscripts in Syria and Egypt collapsed at the end of the century, leaving Persia the undisputed leader in Islamic book illustration.Sims Many of the best miniatures from early manuscripts were removed from their books in later centuries and transferred to albums, several of which are now in Istanbul; this complicates tracing the art history of the period.Simms Miniatures from the Safavid and later periods are far more common than earlier ones, but although some prefer the simpler elegance of the early 15th and 16th centuries, most art historians agree in seeing a rise in quality up to the mid-16th century, culminating in a series of superb royal commissions by the Safavid court, such as the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp (or Houghton Shahnameh). There was a crisis in the 1540s when Shah Tahmasp I, previously a patron on a large scale, ceased to commission works, apparently losing interest in painting. Some of his artists went to the court of his nephew Ibrahim Mirza, governor of Mashad from 1556, where there was a brief flowering of painting until the Shah fell out with his nephew in 1565, including a Haft Awrang, the \\"Freer Jami\\". Other artists went to the Mughal court.Titley, 103; Welch (mostly on Freer Jami after p. 24), 23-27, 31, 98-127; Freer Gallery After this the number of illustrated book manuscript commissions falls off, and the tradition falls into over-sophistication and decline.OAO; Gray (1930), 74-89; Welch, throughout Tabriz in the north-west of Iran is the longest established centre of production, and Baghdad (then under Persian rule) was often important. Shiraz in the south, sometimes the capital of a sub-ruler, was a centre from the late 14th century, and Herat, now in Afghanistan, was important in the periods when it was controlled from Persia, especially when the Timurid prince Baysonqor was governor in the 1420s; he was then the leading patron in Persia, commissioning the Baysonghor Shahnameh and other works. Each centre developed its own style, which were largely reconciled and combined under the Safavids.Gray (1930), 37-55; Welch, 14-18; OAO The schools of Herat, where the Timurid royal workshops usually were, had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, a more expressive and imaginative style. Tabriz was the former capital of the Turkmen rulers, and in the early Safavid period the styles were gradually harmonized in works like the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp.Titley, 80; Walther & Wolf, 420-424 But a famous unfinished miniature showing Rustam asleep, while his horse Rakhsh fights off a lion, was probably made for this manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of Bizhad. It is now in the British Museum.Canby (1993), 79-80 Chinese influences Mi'raj of the Prophet by Sultan Muhammad, showing Chinese- influenced clouds and angels, 1539-43.see Welch, 95-97 Before Chinese influence was introduced, figures were tied to the ground line and included \\"backgrounds of solid color\\", or in \\"clear accordance with indigenous artistic traditions\\". However, once influenced by the Chinese, Persian painters gained much more freedom through the Chinese traditions of \\"unrestricted space and infinite planes\\". Much of the Chinese influence in Persian art is probably indirect, transmitted through Central Asia. There appear to be no Persian miniatures that are clearly the work of a Chinese artist or one trained in China itself. The most prestigious Chinese painting tradition, of literati landscape painting on scrolls, has little influence; instead the closest parallels are with wall-paintings and motifs such as clouds and dragons found in Chinese pottery, textiles, and other decorative arts.Rawson, Chapter 5 The format and composition of the Persian miniature received strong influence from Chinese paintings.Schmitz and Desai, 172; Meri, 585 The Ilkhanid rulers did not convert to Islam for several decades, meanwhile remaining Tantric Buddhists or Christians (usually Nestorians). While very few traces now remain, Buddhist and Christian images were probably easily available to Persian artists at this period.Rawson, 146-147 Especially in Ilkhanid and Timurid Mongol-Persian mythological miniatures, mythical beasts were portrayed in a style close to the Chinese qilin, fenghuang (phoenix), bixie and Chinese dragon, though they have a much more aggressive character in Islamic art, and are often seen fighting each other or natural beasts.Rawson, 169-173  Prominent Persian miniaturists  The workshop tradition and division of labour within both an individual miniature and a book, as described above, complicates the attribution of paintings. Some are inscribed with the name of the artist, sometimes as part of the picture itself, for example as if painted on tiles in a building, but more often as a note added on the page or elsewhere; where and when being often uncertain. Because of the nature of the works, literary and historical references to artists, even if they are relied upon, usually do not enable specific paintings to be identified, though there are exceptions. The reputation of KamƒÅl ud-Dƒ´n BehzƒÅd Herawƒ´, or BehzƒÅd, the leading miniaturist of the late Timurid era, and founder of the Safavid school, remained supreme in the Persianate world, and at least some of his work, and style, can be identified with a degree of confidence, despite a good deal of continuing scholarly debate.Gray (1930), 57-66; OAO Sultan Mohammed, Mir Sayyid Ali, and Aqa Mirak, were leading painters of the next generation, the Safavid culmination of the classic style, whose attributed works are found together in several manuscripts.Welch, 17-27, and many individual pictures shown Abd al-Samad was one of the most successful Persian painters recruited by the Mughal Emperors to work in India. In the next generation, Reza Abbasi worked in the Late Safavid period producing mostly album miniatures, and his style was continued by many later painters.Gray (1930), 80-87 In the 19th century, the miniatures of Abu'l-Hasan Khan Gaffari (Sani ol molk), active in Qajar Persia, showed originality, naturalism, and technical perfection.B.

He is best known as the goaltender for the United States team at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. He was never drafted in the National Hockey League, but played a single game with the Chicago Blackhawks. Biography LeBlanc was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. After playing two seasons of junior hockey in Ontario, LeBlanc turned professional and joined the Pineridge Bucks of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League for the 1984‚Äì85 season. He then played one season for the ACHL's Carolina Thunderbirds before moving on to the International Hockey League, where he would spend the majority of his career. In his rookie season in 1986‚Äì87 with the Flint Spirits, LeBlanc appeared in 63 games and was awarded the Ken McKenzie Trophy as the top American-born rookie in the league. LeBlanc played for the IHL's Flint Spirits, Saginaw Hawks, Indianapolis Ice, Fort Wayne Komets, Cincinnati Cyclones and Chicago Wolves during his career. LeBlanc spent the final two seasons of his career with the Jacksonville Lizard Kings of the ECHL and retired after the 1999‚Äì2000 season. LeBlanc appeared in one National Hockey League game in his career, playing for the Chicago Blackhawks during the 1991‚Äì92 season. His appearance came to allow the Blackhawks to exploit a loophole in the NHL's rules for the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft, where each team had to expose a goaltender who had appeared in at least one game during 1991‚Äì92. LeBlanc was activated and placed into his only game on March 10, 1992, therefore meaning the Blackhawks would not have to expose any of their top three goaltenders: Ed Belfour, Dominik Ha≈°ek and Jimmy Waite. LeBlanc allowed only one goal, earning the victory as the Blackhawks defeated the San Jose Sharks, 5‚Äì1. At the 1992 Winter Olympics, LeBlanc appeared in all eight games for the United States, compiling a record of 5‚Äì2‚Äì1 with two shutouts. The Americans finished out of the medals, however, as they lost 6‚Äì1 to Czechoslovakia in the bronze medal game.

She was the only Royal Navy ship of the line ever to be launched and operated entirely in fresh water. Constructed in 1814, the ship's arrival on the lake ended all naval action and St Lawrence finished the war having never gone into battle. Following the war, the vessel was laid up, eventually being sold in 1832 to private interests. The ship was later sunk and is now a recreational dive spot. Description Master shipbuilder John Dennis and nearly 200 shipwrights built St Lawrence in under ten months, although several sources credit master shipwright William Bell as the designer and builder. Unlike sea- going ships of the line, St Lawrence was constructed without a quarterdeck, poop deck or forecastle. This gave the vessel the appearance of a spar-deck frigate. Furthermore, St Lawrence was not expected to make long ocean voyages and did not have to carry the same amount of stores and provisions. This allowed the designers to make savings in the vessel's capacity. The shipwrights constructing the vessel believed they were building a ship larger than that of the flagship of Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar, . As built St Lawrence measured 2,304 tons burthen. The gundeck's length was and the beam was . The crew numbered 700. In way of armaments, she carried thirty- two 32-pounder carronades and two 68-pounder carronades on the upper deck, thirty-six 24-pounder long guns on the middle deck and twenty-eight 32-pounder long guns, four 24-pounder long guns and two 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck. Service history The ship was ordered to correct the inferior state of the Royal Navy on Lake Ontario in relation to the United States naval forces, specifically in relation those units under the command of Isaac Chauncey. St Lawrence had her keel laid on 12 April 1814. The construction of the ship took a toll on British resources in the area, affecting supply levels throughout the region during the spring and summer. Projected launch dates in June, July and August were missed and in order to provide all of the gear for a ship of this size, the 74-gun ships of the line , and were stripped at Montreal and the material brought to Kingston. St Lawrence was launched on 10 September 1814. British naval commodore Sir James Lucas Yeo commissioned her as his flagship, with Captain Frederick Hickey as Flag Captain, in the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston, Upper Canada. The ship cost Britain ¬£500,000. The day after the ship's launch, an American fleet under Chauncey appeared off Kingston and offered to battle, which the British declined. The vessel did not put to sea until 16 October, making several trips around Lake Ontario. On 19 October, the ship was struck by lightning, damaging the mast and killing several of the crew. The Americans made an attempt to blow St Lawrence up in Kingston harbour using a \\"torpedo\\" which was much more like a floating naval mine. The British drove the attackers off before they could make a serious attempt on the vessel. At the time, Lake Ontario was effectively landlocked for any but the smallest vessels, due to shallow water and rapids on the St. Lawrence River downstream and Niagara Falls upstream. As a result, warships operating on Lake Ontario had to be built on site, either in Kingston or in the American naval dockyards at Sackets Harbor, or converted from merchant ships already operating in the lake. Control of the lake, which was the most important supply route for the British for military operations to the west, had passed back and forth between the Americans and the British over the course of the war. The construction of a first rate ship of the line, in a campaign that had been dominated by sloops and frigates, gave the British uncontested control of the lake during the final months of the war. HMS St Lawrence never saw action, because her presence on the lake deterred the U.S. fleet from setting sail. After the war ended in 1815, the ship was decommissioned. In January 1832, the hull was sold to Robert Drummond for ¬£25. Between May and August, the hull was towed out of Navy Bay. It later formed the end of a pier attached to Morton's Brewery in Kingston and was used as a storage facility by the brewery, for cordwood among other materials. Later, it sank in of water close to shore at . The vessel's remains rotted away until as of 2009, only the keel and ribs of the frame of St Lawrence remain. The wrecksite, along with those of and , were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2015.

The typical cause is sediment (alluvium) deposited by a river. This sediment, legally termed the accessory, accreses (ie: merges with) a piece of land, the principal, (operating a subtype of the Roman mode of acquisition by accession) and thus accedes to the ownership of the principal land over time. It continues to have relevance in the modern age, as a result of the adoption of Roman property law by modern legal systems, primarily civil law jurisdictions.

She was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor on July 1, 1985, the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999. Berenson was the first person to introduce and adapt rules for women's basketball to Smith College in 1899, modifying the existing men's rules. Abbott was the sister of the art historian Bernard Berenson and a great-great-aunt of Berry Berenson and Marisa Berenson.  Background  = Family = Abbott was born as Senda Valvrojenski to Albert and Judith Valvrojenski in Butrimonys, Vilna Governorate, Russian Empire to a Lithuanian Jewish family, who would immigrate to the United States when she was seven years old. Her older brother was Bernard Berenson, and she would later have another younger brother and two younger sisters. Her father Albert grew up following an educational track of classical Jewish learning and contemplated becoming a rabbi. However, he became a practitioner of Haskalah, a European movement which advocated more integration of Jews into secular society. After his home and lumber business were burned to the ground, he lived with his more traditionalist in-laws who pressured him to enroll Bernard with a Hebrew and Aramaic tutor. He decided to move to the United States to raise his family according to his own beliefs, moving alone in 1874 to the West End of Boston. He became a \\"poor peddler of pots and pans\\", selling his wares in nearby towns. Albert changed his surname to Berenson soon after his arrival as part of his \\"Westernization\\". After months of work, he sent for his family in 1875. Albert insisted that the family speak only English, stopped attending synagogue, and attempted to sever ties to their Jewish traditions. Despite this, his children did not fully abandon their faith. Bernard described himself as Jewish and continued to practice some rituals, though he did not have a Bar Mitzvah. The family had moved to a section of Boston with almost fifty families from their original neighborhood, some of whom were relatives, so they grew up with religious influences. After her brother attended the Boston Latin School, he moved to Cambridge to prepare to enroll at Harvard. Since she and her brother were close, Senda spent part of her mid- teens in Cambridge. Following his graduation from Harvard, Bernard moved to Europe, eventually settling in Italy, where he began a career as an art critic.Senda Berenson in 1888 = Early life = Senda did not have much interest in athletics as a child and preferred music, literature, and art. She was \\"frail and delicate\\" in her childhood, which interfered with her schooling. She was partially home-schooled by her father and attended Boston Latin Academy (then known as Girl's Latin School), but did not graduate. She briefly attended the Boston Conservatory of Music, but health issues forced her to leave the school. She had tried painting and the piano, but her health limited both; she was unable to keep up the practice. Senda moved out of the house and began a relationship with a man named David. However, Bernard was not yet self-sufficient, and Senda would send him money on a regular basis. She ended up moving back home, for what were \\"probably economic reasons\\". The relationship with David was serious enough to prompt a proposal of marriage, but Senda declined and they amicably ended their relationship near the end of 1888. Her health continued to deteriorate, forcing her to give up her piano lessons at the Conservatory due to her back problems. She slowed her writing to her brother, who worried about her health, and urged her to take a summer in the country. That refreshed her temporarily and she re-enrolled at the Conservatory, but she was unable to keep it up, and fell into a long depression that extended into 1890. = Boston Normal School of Gymnastics = Mary Hemenway was a philanthropist in Boston who had many interests, both within Boston and elsewhere. In 1867, Hemenway was funding many Reconstruction Era schools in the South, where she met Amy Morris Homans, a nineteen-year old who had traveled to work in the schools. When Hemenway returned to Boston, Homans returned with her as her executive secretary. In 1887, Hemenway founded the Boston Normal School of Cooking. The following year, she provided instruction to one hundred Boston school teachers in a system of gymnastics education known as the Swedish system. At the time, the predominant form of physical education was a German style of gymnastics, with an emphasis on strength training and competitiveness. In 1889, Hemenway funded and Homans arranged a conference on physical training, which had national influence on the course of physical education in schools. The conference \\"is considered by most historians to be pivotal in the development of American physical education\\". Wool serge gymnasium suit with blouse, sailor collar and bloomer- style trousers, ca. 1915 In that same year, Hemenway created the Boston Normal School of Gymnastics with Homans as its first director. The school drew faculty from several resources, including the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastics, founded by Pehr Henrik Ling in Sweden, as well as faculty from Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Psychology was taught by Harvard's Josiah Royce. Later, the school would become Department of Hygiene and Physical Education at Wellesley College. Berenson learned about the School of Gymnastics from a friend and decided to enroll briefly to improve her physical condition so that she could return to the Conservatory. However, the entrance requirements included high school graduation or equivalent, and Berenson hadn't graduated from Boston Latin Academy. In addition, the entrants were expected to be in satisfactory physical condition, which was not Berenson's case. Berenson met with Homans, and Homans took a liking to her and felt that her physical condition could be improved and that the result might serve as a testament to the schools approach. Homans decided to admit Berenson. The school offered a two-tier teacher training course and a one-year certificate course; Berenson enrolled in the one-year program. Berenson's start was inauspicious. Years later she would exclaim \\"how I hated that school for the first few months!\\". She wasn't interested in the gymnastics work, as the exercises made her \\"ache all over\\". Early on, just standing erect for five minutes forced her to lie down, and she found she had to study lying on her back. She decided to give the exercises a \\"fair trial\\", and she saw improvement in three months. By the end of the year, she was doing the prescribed two hours a day of exercise and felt much better. Her brother was disappointed to hear that she had not returned to the Conservatory but did not fully comprehend how much she had improved at the gymnastics school. Berenson decided to enroll at the school for a second year. = Smith College‚Äîinitial hiring = Berenson's condition improved so markedly that Homans sent her to the elementary school in Andover to teach the headmaster and faculty about the Swedish theory of gymnastics. Berenson made twice-weekly visits to the school. This first attempt at teaching proved so successful that, when Homans learned of a temporary opening due to the illness of a teacher at Smith College, she recommended that Berenson consider it, even though she had not completed her second year. The previous gymnastics instructor had been Grace Watson, another Boston Normal School of Gymnastics alumna who had started there in 1891 to head the Swedish gymnastics program. Miss Watson left Smith in January 1892 as a result of an illness, and died November 24, 1892. Berenson would later be described as a \\"missionary\\" referring to her strong support for the inclusion of physical education in the lives of the students. This characterization was intriguing for two reasons: # less than two years earlier, her physical condition would not even permit her to play the piano for long stretches # her position was expected to be temporary, making it all that more unusual that she would push her beliefs so forcefully. Perhaps her own improvement, which she attributed to the Swedish gymnastics, led her to the belief that her experience could be transferred to others. She promoted physical education outside of Smith College as well. The local high school Northampton High School experimented with the Swedish system of gymnastics under her direction in 1892. She also introduced Swedish exercise and games such as basketball to the inmates at the Northampton Lunatic Asylum. Exterior of Alumnae Gymnasium at Smith College. The upper windows look into the gymnasium where the first women's basketball games were played in 1892Berenson arrived at a school with well-equipped facilities. The school had recently completed the Alumnae Gymnasium in 1890, which provided some of the best facilities in the country for college women. Although the physical facilities were in fine shape, the notion that women should engage in physical exercise, much less be required to do so, was not then well- established. The prevailing atmosphere did not support the notion that women should engage in physical activity. Berenson would write, in 1894, > Until recent years, the so-called ideal woman was a small waisted, small > footed, small brained damsel, who prided herself on her delicate health, who > thought fainting interesting, and hysterics fascinating. Berenson sought to establish mandatory physical education in this atmosphere. She spent considerable time presenting her position to the faculty and administration. One meeting began with only one faculty member was in agreement, but by the meeting's end, she had persuaded the faculty to support a mandatory second year of physical education. While Berenson saw the need to persuade the faculty, she naively thought the students were more supportive. She had heard that some of the students felt the exercises were too boring, but she had six classes each day filled with \\"enthusiastic girls\\". Because of the evident enthusiasm, she decided it would not be necessary to take attendance. However, when she reached the end of the school year and was provided a complete roster for the purpose of recording grades, she realized that many students had never come to class. She instituted roll call the following year.  Women's basketball origins  Known as the Mother of Women's Basketball, Berenson became the first woman enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985.College basketball tickets, issued for interclass women's basketball games in 1897 and 1900. In 1892, after Berenson realized that the gymnastic exercises were not as popular as she had originally thought, she looked for alternatives. She read about the new game of basketball, invented by James Naismith, in the YMCA publication Physical Education. Group games were \\"unheard of\\" at Smith, but she felt this would be an interesting experiment. Other attempts at teaching games had not succeeded, in part because the women of that time had no experience with team play. Initial games were played in class in the spring of 1892. The exact date of the first informal game is not known, but one student wrote to her mother on March 6, 1892, describing a new game they were playing, in which the object was to put a ball into your opponent's basket, as \\"great fun\\". Instead of the peach baskets used in the first men's game, the goals in the first women's game were fashioned from waste baskets. The response was so positive that she scheduled a game between the freshman and sophomore classes. That game, played March 22, 1893, was also played with Naismith rules. The players wore bloomers, and no men were admitted to the event. The players all wore blue uniforms, adorned by an armband with the color associated with their class. The spectators wore the class colors, green for the sophomore class of 1895, and lavender, for the freshman class of 1896. When Berenson tossed the ball between the two opposing centers, she struck the outstretched arm of the freshman team's center, dislocating her shoulder. The start of this game was delayed while they attended to the distressed player and arranged for a substitute. The New York Herald reported five days later that \\"[i]n spite of the fact that the sophomore captain was disabled at the beginning of the game, the score was 5-4 in favor of the sophomores after a close contest of two 15-minute halves.\\" Despite her unflagging efforts to support physical education for young women, Berenson did not encourage inter-scholastic games. In her words, \\"We should encourage the instinct of play, not competition.\\" This set a precedent for the non-participation in interscholastic events which would be followed for many years. While competition with other schools was discouraged, she did promote competition among classes and established a tradition of interclass games. The atmosphere at the games was noisy, but enthusiasm was expressed by singing. Shouting would result in the discontinuance of the game. Berenson had introduced the game as an experiment, so she sought to determine how the students reacted to the game. She polled her students, and all but one felt they had improved in many areas, including \\"endurance, lung capacity, alertness, courage, [and] toughness\\". One student reported that the game brought her \\"health, wealth and happiness\\", the second of which was attributed to lower doctor bills. The early game followed different rules than are followed today, as evidenced by a play dreamed up by one of the freshmen on the first teams: > She threw a low ball against the wall at such an angle that it bounded back > into the hands of one of her own players who was watching for it = Modifying the rules = The 1915 edition of the rules as edited by BerensonBerenson was pleased with the reception to the game but felt some changes were needed. She thought the game had a \\"tendency to roughness\\", so she sat down with her class to discuss how to modify the rules. She divided the court into three regions and prohibited players from leaving their assigned region. Players could not dribble more than three times, hold the ball for more than three seconds, or snatch the ball from an opponent. The Division of Girls' and Women's Sports of the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation felt the need for a written set of rules specifically applicable to the women's game and asked Berenson to undertake a publication outlining the rules. Berenson formalized her rules into a set of official rules ‚Äì Line Basketball or Basket Ball for Women, often referred to as Basket Ball for Women. In 1901, the Spalding Library published the rules with Berenson as editor and would continue to publish them for eighteen years. Berenson organized the United States Basket Ball Committee in 1905, where she served as chairman until 1917. The rules would remain in use with only minor modification until the 1960s. This is a diagram of the basketball court in use for women's basketball consistent with rules adopted in 1899. = Views on basketball = Berenson viewed the sport as \\"a complete educational experience\\" and did not allow players to play if they failed in subjects; the importance of education was paramount. Players were required to wear their hair in braids or ribbons to maintain a tidy appearance. In addition to physical development, she felt the game helped players develop intellectually and emotionally via decision making and the following of the rules. She encouraged her students to suggest alternative rules or different methods of play to improve the game. She encouraged responsibility by naming captains, who helped serve as coaches for the players.  Smith College ‚Äî subsequent years  Smith class of 1902 basketball team Berenson was the physical education department director here at Smith College. At the end of her first year, Berenson was invited to return to Smith in fall when her original, temporary position was made permanent. With the expectation of a future income, plus a financial contribution from her brother Bernard whom she hadn't seen for several years, she decided to spend the summer in Europe to visit him. Bernard initially discouraged her visit, because he was in a relationship with a married woman, Mary Costelloe. His concerns were apt; the visit was strained whenever Mary was present, but Bernard took pleasure in showing his sister around Europe and introducing her to his friends. When Berenson returned, she continued to develop her gymnastics program as the Instructor in Gymnastics but pursued other interests with the aid of a part-time assistant. She had visited a number of art galleries during her summer with Bernard, and she keep up her interest in art. She corresponded with Bernard regularly, who was happy to hear of her interest in art. He was not yet convinced that her career in gymnastics was wise, hoping that she would abandon it for a career in art. Berenson wrote often about art, partly to show Bernard she could keep up with him intellectually. She did not emphasize her work, although she did send him a picture of herself in her gymnastics outfit. She was also involved in campus theater, starting with play reading and continuing with appearances in several plays. She played the lead role in a William Dean Howells play Unexpected Guest, which was so well-received, they performed it a second time. Berenson attended the Royal Central Institute of Gymnastic in Stockholm and organized the Gymnastics and Field Association at Smith in 1893. After her return from Stockholm, she started a folk dance program at Smith and introduced fencing to the school in 1895. In 1901, she introduced field hockey with the help of Lady Constance Applebee of England. She later also adapted volleyball for women. In 1911, she married a professor of English at Smith, Herbert Vaughan Abbott. Soon afterward, Berenson resigned from her position, although she continued her interest in sport by serving as the Director of Physical Education at the Mary A. Burham School located in Northampton, Massachusetts.

The species range from low-growing herbaceous plants to semi-woody shrubs up to tall. Commonly they are known as cupheas, or, in the case of some species, as cigar plants. The generic name is derived from the Greek word Œ∫œÖœÜŒøœÇ (kyphos), meaning \\"bent,\\" \\"curved,\\" or \\"humped.\\" Uses C. hyssopifolia) fruit with seeds Several Cuphea species are popular ornamental plants or honey plants. C. ignea 'David Verity' and C. micropetalia are popular plants to attract hummingbirds. Some species of Cuphea are used to produce cuphea oil, of interest as sources of medium-chain triglycerides. For most purposes, cuphea oil is identical to coconut oil and palm oil; these are derived from strictly tropical plants however and - particularly in the latter case - the expanding production of which has caused a considerable amount of habitat destruction. Cuphea may thus produce a valuable source of income for farmers in temperate regions, and by supplementing coconut and palm oil to satisfy the growing demand (e.g. for biodiesel production) at the same time decreasing the need for wholesale logging in tropical countries. Early attempts at commercial production have focused on an interspecific hybrid population derived from C. lanceolata and Clammy Cuphea (C. viscosissima). Cuphea has also been shown to improve agricultural crops in North America when used in crop rotation. Crop rotation is commonly practiced among farmers to improve soil quality, control host- specific pests, and decrease the use of fertilizers and pesticides. When cuphea was introduced into the crop rotation of corn and wheat, scientists from the Agricultural Research Service of the USDA found that the addition of cuphea had positive effects on the following harvest, including a higher yield of crop and crops that are higher in protein. Such research reveals how cuphea can be used in agriculture to increase the profitability of crops like wheat and corn. The seed oils of some species are very rich in one particular fatty acid. C. painteri oil, for example, is about three-quarters caprylic acid; C. carthagenensis oil consists of about 80% lauric acid. C. koehneana oil may be the richest natural source of a single fatty acid, with 95% of its content consisting of capric acid. Currently the plant is not commonly used for medicinal effects; however, chemical analysis of its fatty oils suggest the plant could possibly serve as an algicidal, fungicidal or antibiotic agent. There is also reason to believe the plant could be effective as an appetite stimulant.

In the early history of the city, the neighborhood was centered on the Bustleton Tavern, a local bar established before the American Revolution. Pennypack Park is part of the Fairmount Park system and was the site of much industry including mills. The area was a trading center and had hotels drawing farmers bringing goods for sale via horse and buggy. Much of the commerce was also conducted via small streams and rivers of the present-day Pennypack Watershed. The old Paul's Run waterway once provided navigation from the Bustleton Tavern all the way to the Delaware River. One of the early schools went by the name: Bustleton Academy, also known as The Academy at Bustelton, not to be confused with Lower Dublin Academy which was a much older school and was also located in the same township. Bustleton was originally part of Lower Dublin Township, also known as Dublin Township, a defunct township that was located in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The township ceased to exist and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. Bustleton is home to one of the oldest churches in America, Lower Dublin Baptist Church now known as Pennypack Baptist. Maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the large Roman Catholic parish that served as a mother church for most of the parishes in the Northeast section of Philadelphia. Saint Katherine Drexel attended Mass in the Old BVM Church, now included in Pennypack Park. Present day In the present day, Bustleton is largely a residential community with major commercial areas on Roosevelt Boulevard, Bustleton Avenue, Grant Avenue, and Red Lion Road. It has minimal industrial presence. US Census Bureau data show that the community is home to an increasingly racially and ethnically diverse population with many immigrant groups represented; in particular one can see store-fronts, billboards, and newspapers in Russian (especially along Bustleton Avenue) from the many immigrants from Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet Republics. See US Census Bureau at www.census.gov Population According to the 2000 US Census, the total population was 31,853 of which 45.9 percent were male, less than the 49.1 percent of the total US population that was male in 2000. Just less than 17 percent of area residents were under 18 years old compared with over a quarter throughout the US. Nearly 27 percent were 65 years or older, well more than twice the rate in the general population; 4 percent of the total Bustleton population was 85 years or older. Reflecting the large concentration of older citizens, the median age in Bustleton was 46.8 years compared with 35.3 years nationwide, and local residents were somewhat more likely to be disabled, 26.4 percent versus a national average of 19.3 percent.2000 US Census www.census.gov Whites made up 87.1 percent of the population (US share was 75.1 percent), blacks were 3.5 percent (US share was 12.3 percent), Asians were 7.0 percent (US share was 3.6 percent) with the majority of those Indian-American. Nearly one-third of residents spoke a foreign language at home compared with less than 18 percent nationwide.2000 US Census www.census.gov Economically, only 53.4 percent of those 16 years or older were in the labor force in 2000, well below the US average of 63.9 percent but the per capita income of $21,540 was nearly identical to the national level. Less than 10 percent were below the poverty level (US rate was 12.4 percent).2000 US Census www.census.gov Four of every 5 adults, 25 years and over, were at least high school graduates in 2000, and 1 in 4 had at least a bachelor's degree (slightly more than the US population).2000 US Census www.census.gov See US Census Bureau at www.census.gov Bustleton is home to many of the city's Police Officers and Firefighters.http://www.phillymag.com/news/2017/08/19/martina-white- philadelphia-republican/ Transportation Public transportation is provided by several SEPTA bus and regional rail routes, including bus routes 19, 58, 67, and the West Trenton Line and Fox Chase Line regional rail lines in nearby communities.see SEPTA atwww.septa.org for route information Major roads include Welsh Road, Verree Road, Red Lion Road (PA 63), Bustleton Avenue (PA 532), Grant Avenue, Krewstown Road, and the Roosevelt Boulevard (U.S. 1). Bustleton is home to two of the most dangerous intersections in the United States: Roosevelt Boulevard at Grant Avenue and at Red Lion Road. After decades of complaints due to the large numbers of accidents, these intersections became the first in Philadelphia to have cameras installed which record the license plates of vehicles entering the intersections after the traffic light has turned red. The program has since spread to many intersections throughout the city. It is bordered on the east by Northeast Philadelphia Airport, a municipal reliever airport that dates to World War II. Housing According to the 2000 US Census, there were 13,719 occupied housing units, 62 percent were owner-occupied and 38 percent were renter- occupied; the 423 vacant units were just 3 percent of all Bustleton-units, a vacancy rate one-third that of the US. There were 7,209 single-family owner- occupied homes with a median value of $120,000, just $400 more than the median for the US as a whole.See US Census at www.census.gov In 2007, newly constructed single homes were selling for between $350,000 and $500,000.

Levy was born in Portsmouth, England and educated at the Ecole de Commerce, Lausanne. He wrote a number of plays between 1908 and 1925. In 1920, Levy opened the Grand Guignol theatre in the Little Theatre located in the London's Strand District. Levy's productions featured performances by the English stage actress Sybil Thorndike, who would eventually originate the role of Joan of Arc in George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan. During its inaugural season, Levy's company staged such notorious thrillers as Andre de Lorde's The Hand of Death. The Grand Guignol experiment ended in 1922 when Levy met with interference from England's censorious Lord Chamberlain's Department. Upon announcing its demise, Levy stated that \\"the reason I am finishing with Grand Guignol is the too rigid censorship. . . it is impossible to carry on while the Lord Chamberlain's Department raises so many difficulties.\\" In March 1934 Levy received the L√©gion d'honneur for recognition of his contributions to French drama and theatre in England. In an obituary published on 10 October 1936 in The Times, James Agate praised Levy‚Äôs passion for the theatre. He wrote that ‚Äúunlike many theatre managers, (Levy) was intensely interested in theatre.

The codices produced by him, containing his commentaries are credited with preserving many ancient texts, including those of Plato and Marcus Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\". Life He was born at Patrae (modern-day Greece). He was a disciple of Photius. He studied at the University of Constantinople. He became Deacon of Patrea around 900 and was made Archbishop of Caesarea by Nikolas of Constantinople in 903. He was deeply involved in court politics and was a principal actor in the controversy over the scandal created when Emperor Leo VI attempted to marry a fourth time after his first three wives had died and left him without an heir. Despite Arethas' fame as a scholar, Jenkins thinks little of him as a person. When recounting the details of the scandal, Arethas is described as \\"...narrow-minded, bad-hearted... morbidly ambitious and absolutely unscrupulous...\\" Works Arethas' comment on Lucian of Samosata from Harley MS 5694, mentioning the Meditations by Marcus Aurelius. His are the earliest direct references to the work. He is the compiler of a Greek commentary (scholia) on the Apocalypse, for which he made considerable use of the similar work of his predecessor, Andrew of Caesarea. It was first printed in 1535 as an appendix to the works of Oecumenius.It is found in P.G., CVI, 493. Albert Ehrhard inclines to the opinion that he wrote other scriptural commentaries. To his interest in the earliest Christian literature, caught perhaps from the above-named Andrew, we owe the Arethas Codex,Paris, Gr. 451. through which the texts of almost all of the ante-Nicene Greek Christian apologists have, in great measure, reached us.Otto Bardenhewer, Patrologie, 40. He is also known as a commentator of Plato and Lucian; the famous manuscript of Plato (Codex Clarkianus), taken from Patmos to London, was copied by order of Arethas. Other important Greek manuscripts, e.g. of Euclid,L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars 2nd. ed. (Oxford, 1974) p. 57 the rhetor Aristides, and perhaps of Dio Chrysostom, are owing to him. Karl Krumbacher emphasizes his fondness for ancient classical Greek literature and the original sources of Christian theology. Arethas' works also contain the oldest known references to the Meditations (written c. 175 AD) by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Arethas admits to holding the work in high regard in letters to the Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise and in his comments to Lucian and Dio Chrysostom'. Arethas is credited with reintroducing the Meditations to public discourse. Up through the 19th century, scholars believed there to be an earlier Arethas, also an archbishop of Caesarea, who had authored the works on the Apocalypse, around the year 540. Modern scholars believe this to be incorrect, and there to have been only one Arethas.Smith, William. A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \\"Aretas\\".

She debuted in the 2011 Mortal Kombat game, where she was the only full-fledged newcomer to the game. Originally a rumored glitch character similar to Ermac, Skarlet was the first ever DLC character in a Mortal Kombat game. Skarlet was created by Shao Kahn using the blood of many warriors. As such, many of her attacks use blood. Since her debut, she has become known for having some of the most gruesome Fatalities. Appearances In her Mortal Kombat bio, Skarlet is a warrior created by Shao Kahn using sorcery and the blood of countless warriors, only to be released by him as a last resort. Her sole purpose is to discover Quan Chi's true reason for attending the Mortal Kombat tournament. In Mortal Kombat 11 where it furthers her background story, Skarlet started out as a poor and orphan child who was adopted by Shao Kahn to learn blood magic upon her transformation and then, an imperial bodyguard and effective assassin. Skarlet uses kodachi swords and kunai knives as well as her power to turn into, and absorb, the blood of her victims in addition to be able to manipulate her victim's blood. Skarlet can also sense her enemies' blood beneath, allowing her not to be fooled by their disguises. Similar to the Ermac rumors in the first Mortal Kombat but received with far less fanfare, Skarlet originated as a nonexistent character in Mortal Kombat II due to false reports of a glitch nicknamed \\"Scarlet\\" by players in which the palette swaps of either Kitana or Mileena would turn red. Nearly two decades after the rumors originated, she was announced as one of the 2011 reboot Mortal Kombat game's first two downloadable content (DLC) characters, released on June 21. Skarlet later returned as a playable character in the 2019 video game, Mortal Kombat 11, furthering her origin as a regular Outworld street urchin prior her transformation into a blood magic master after Shao Kahn adopted her. Skarlet made a few very brief cameos in the 2011 reboot‚Äôs story mode. Skarlet, while not actually appearing in Mortal Kombat X, does appear in the comics based on the game, where she was recruited by Reiko for the Outworld civil war. She was defeated by Mileena, and went missing prior her past counterpart‚Äôs appearance in Mortal Kombat 11. Design and gameplay Cosplay of Skarlet's original design from Mortal Kombat at IgroMir 2017 Much of Skarlet's moveset revolves around the use of blood. She uses kodachi and kunai as standard weapons in addition to crafting others out of blood in Mortal Kombat 11. Her \\"Blood Ball\\" projectile attack deals significant damage yet reduces her own health. Skarlet was deemed one of the \\"cheapest\\" characters in MK 2011 by Prima Games. Reception Skarlet received a middling critical reception upon her playable debut in MK2011. Den of Geek rated Skarlet 48th in their 2015 ranking of the Mortal Kombat franchise's 73 characters. \\"There‚Äôs something kind of lazy about having someone be 'Blood: The Character.'\\" Leon Miller of Screen Rant rated her twelfth out of the series' twenty ninja characters in 2017. \\"Fan service can be a bit of a double-edged sword, and so it goes with a fighter like Skarlet [who] can‚Äôt avoid being a tad underdeveloped.\\" Chris Isaac of Comic Book Resources rated Skarlet thirteenth in a 2017 ranking of the series' then-nineteen female characters, in that she \\"had kind of a cool gimmick, but was very scarce on personality.\\" However, the character was well received by Game Informer, and in 2013, was ranked as the seventh \\"fiercest female in today's fighting games\\" by Gamenguide, who commented: \\"Nothing screams 'fan service' like when a developer takes an age-old game glitch and turns it into a key part of their franchise.\\" Official Xbox Magazine included her among the top eight downloadable characters on the Xbox 360 for her \\"delightful\\" fighting style, even though \\"she wasn't the best-selling MK DLC character.\\"[Criminally underused: the best Xbox DLC characters; Call their agents - these guys deserve bigger parts  The Xbox Official Magazine] In 2015, she was listed among the best Easter eggs in Mortal Kombat history by Tech Times. Skarlet has been considered among the most \\"gruesome\\" series characters. Her \\"Make it Rain\\" Fatality was included among Gameranx's top ten gruesome series finishers in 2012: \\"Skarlet gives herself the most disgusting facial in history.\\" That same Fatality would also be listed as the second-best Fatality in MK 2011 by Complex, for being \\"as gruesome and sadistic as they come.\\" She was described by TheGamer as \\"one of the most unsettling characters\\" of the Mortal Kombat 11 roster. Josh West of GamesRadar+ exemplified the \\"brutality\\" of MK11 through one of her Fatalities, in which she repeatedly stabs her defeated opponent with a series of daggers composed of their drained blood.

Formerly a 19th-century Catholic school, it is the first fully dedicated contemporary visual arts museum in Singapore with one of the world‚Äôs most important collections by local, Southeast and East Asian artists. It collaborates with international art museums to co- curate contemporary art exhibitions. SAM consists of two adjacent sites. The main building, dating back to 1955 is the former Saint Joseph‚Äôs Institution on Bras Basah Road; the second building known as the 'SAM at 8Q' was the former Catholic High School on Queen Street. The museum organised the Singapore Biennale in 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019 and will continue to do so in 2022.Singapore Biennale  History  Officially opened on 20 January 1996,About the Singapore Art MuseumYourSingapore SAM is one of the first art museums with international-standard museum facilities and programmes in Southeast Asia. The museum, then known as a fine art museum, was born out of a project by the National Museum to set up a five-museum precinct in the city. The other four museums that make up the precinct are known as the Singapore History Museum, Asian Civilisations Museum, People's Museum and the Children's Museum. The Fine Arts Museum project began with the restoration of the former St. Joseph's Institution building. At the same time, the appointment of artist and surgeon Earl Lu to head an 11-member Fine Arts Museum Board was announced on 18 July 1992, by the Minister of State (Information and the Arts and Education), Ker Sin Tze. The museum board was tasked to acquire works of art by notable painters from Southeast Asia and East Asia, and by upcoming artists from these regions. Low Chuck Tiew, a retired banker and prominent art collector, served as museum adviser, along with Shirley Loo-Lim, Deputy Director of the National Museum of Singapore as vice-chairman of the board. Geh Min, Ho Kok Hoe, Lee Seng Tee, Arthur Lim, T. K. Sabapathy, Sarkasi Said, Sum Yoke Kit, Wee Chwee Heng, Singapore Polytechnic alumni, and Yap-Whang Whee Yong formed the rest of the museum board. The restoration work on the then 140-year-old national monument took more than two years at a cost of S$30 million. It first opened its doors to the public as the Singapore Art Museum on 20 October 1995. Its first art installation was a S$90,000, -high Swarovski crystal chandelier at the museum main entrance. It weighs 325 kilograms and took over three months to make. The museum was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong on 20 January 1996. In his opening speech he envisioned the new museum, along with the other four museums in the Arts and Heritage District and the Arts Centre, aiding Singapore in reprising its historic role as a centre of entrepot trade for the arts, culture, civilisation and ideas to the people in the Asian region and the rest of the world. In 2019, the museum closed for a second revamp that will add space and facilities while preserving the old buildings‚Äô heritage architecture. The $90 million development is supported by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), and Tote Board. During this period, exhibitions and events will continue at partner venues and community spaces. The revamp will be completed in 2022.  Location and amenities  Situated in the heart of Singapore's arts and culture district, SAM is located alongside Singapore's major performing arts and visual arts institutions: the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, LASALLE College of the Arts, the Stamford Arts Centre, the Selegie Arts Centre, Singapore Calligraphy Centre, YMS Arts Centre, Dance Ensemble Singapore, Action Theatre and School of the Arts. In addition to the main museum building, SAM maintains an annexe on 8 Queen Street, SAM at 8Q, which also exhibits SAM's permanent collection of contemporary art, as well as newly-commissioned, contemporary artworks. SAM is accessible by major public transportation systems such as the public buses, MRT and cab services. SAM is a 2-minute walk from Bras Basah or Bencoolen MRT stations, and a 10-minute walk from Bugis, Dhoby Ghaut or City Hall MRT stations.  Collections  SAM's approach is to present works curated from the permanent collection alongside changing exhibitions, to offer a well-rounded aesthetic experience of Asian contemporary art. From 2001, the museum began acquiring works and accepting donations from around the region, including regional contemporary artists like Cheo Chai Hiang, Dinh Q Le, Natee Utarit, Nge Lay, Suzann Victor and Titarubi. The museum also regularly partners with other leading art institutions to co-curate and produce exhibitions, such as the collaboration with the Yokohama Museum of Art for Still Moving: A Triple Bill on the Image; Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo for Trans-Cool TOKYO (highlighting works by Japanese artists such as Yayoi Kusama and Yasumasa Morimura); and Video, An Art, A History with the Pompidou Center (Bill Viola, Jean-Luc Godard, Bruce Nauman). The museum organises regularly contemporary art exhibitions and events. For example, French artist St√©phane Blanquet was invited, twice, to present installations. Once, for the Night Lights festival in 2012, with Distorted Forest and once for Art Gardens in 2013, with Glossy Dreams in Depth\\". French artist Emmanuel Guillaud presented an in-situ version of his installation Until the sun rises in 2011http://www.ambafrance-sg.org/Night- encounters-with-Emmanuel Controversies SAM has had multiple censorship controversies. In 2008, SAM hosted ARX 5 (Artists‚Äô Regional Exchange) where Hong Kong artist and caricaturist Zunzi's work, Lee's Garden, was removed from the museum's walls by its staff. The work consisted of a caricature of Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong wielding pest-control gear, with the senior minister and former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew patting him on the back. This censorship was committed without any consultation with or notification of the artist, and sparked off a diplomatic and media firestorm. In late 2011, following a private preview, SAM removed Japanese-British artist Simon Fujiwara‚Äôs work, Welcome to the Hotel Munber. The piece, which was part of an exhibition organised by the National Arts Council in 2010, featured homoerotic content. Despite advisory notices put up by the museum and the Singapore Biennale, the work was taken down without any consultation with or notification of the artist after pressure by conservative groups.

Scandinavian ginger nuts, also called ginger bread or \\"brunkage\\" in Danish (literally meaning \\"brown biscuits\\"), pepparkakor in Swedish, piparkakut in Finnish, pipark≈´kas in Latvian, piparkoogid in Estonian and pepperkaker in Norwegian (literally, pepper cookies), are rolled quite thin (often under thick), and cut into shapes; they are smooth and are usually much thinner and hence crisper (and in some cases, more strongly flavoured) than most global varieties. Cloves, cinnamon and cardamom are important ingredients of these, and the actual ginger taste is not prominent. Allspice has been used to season ginger biscuits, but in some cases cloves replaced it later.Mattila, Anna- Liisa: Piparikirja. Jyv√§skyl√§: Atena, 2001. .

Data extracted from the Halobacteriaceae represent a large part of halophilic Archaea, along with members in two other methanogenic families, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanocalculaceae. The family consists of many diverse genera that can survive extreme environmental niches. Most commonly, Halobacteriaceae are found in hypersaline lakes and can even tolerate sites polluted by heavy metals. They include neutrophiles, acidophiles (ex. Halarchaeum acidiphilum), alkaliphiles (ex. Natronobacterium), and there have even been psychrotolerant species discovered (ex. Hrr. lacusprofundi). Some members have been known to live aerobically, as well as anaerobically, and they come in many different morphologies. These diverse morphologies include rods in genus Halobacterium, cocci in Halococcus, flattened discs or cups in Haloferax, and other shapes ranging from flattened triangles in Haloarcula to squares in Haloquadratum, and Natronorubrum. Most species of Halobacteriaceae are best known for their high salt tolerance and red-pink pigmented members (due to bacterioruberin carotenoids), but there are also non-pigmented species and those that require moderate salt conditions. Some species of Halobacteriaceae have been shown to exhibit phosphorus solubilizing activities that contribute to phosphorus cycling in hypersaline environments. Techniques such as 16S rRNA analysis and DNA-DNA hybridization have been major contributors to taxonomic classification in Halobacteriaceae, partly due to the difficulty in culturing halophilic Archaea.  Overview  Halobacteriaceae are found in water saturated or nearly saturated with salt. They are also called halophiles, though this name is also used for other organisms which live in somewhat less concentrated salt water. They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt, moisture, and organic material are available. Large blooms appear reddish, from the pigment bacteriorhodopsin. This pigment is used to absorb light, which provides energy to create ATP. Halobacteria also possess a second pigment, halorhodopsin, which pumps in chloride ions in response to photons, creating a voltage gradient and assisting in the production of energy from light. The process is unrelated to other forms of photosynthesis involving electron transport; however, and halobacteria are incapable of fixing carbon from carbon dioxide. Halobacteria can exist in salty environments because although they are aerobes, they have a separate and different way of creating energy through use of light energy. Parts of the membranes of halobacteria are purplish in color and contain retinal pigment. This allows them to create a proton gradient across the membrane of the cell which can be used to create ATP for their own use. They have certain adaptations to live within their salty environments. For example, their cellular machinery is adapted to high salt concentrations by having charged amino acids on their surfaces, allowing the cell to keep its water molecules around these components. The osmotic pressure and these amino acids help to control the amount of salt within the cell. However, because of these adaptations, if the cell is placed in a wet, less salty environment, it is likely to immediately burst from the osmotic pressure. Phylogeny The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the phylogeny is based on 16S rRNA- based LTP release 106 by 'The All-Species Living Tree' Project.'The All- Species Living Tree' Project.

He was well-placed socially. His religious beliefs effectively prevented him from supporting Charles Darwin's theories after 1859, but Darwin remained a close friend. Wollaston supported the theory that continental lands had once extended outward farther to encompass some of the island groups he studied. Life Thomas Vernon Wollaston was born in Scotter, Lincolnshire, England, in 1822. In 1845 he gained a B.A. degree from Jesus College, Cambridge, and in 1847 he was made a fellow of the Linnean Society. Wollaston spent the winter of 1847‚Äì1848 in Madeira, returning for his Cambridge M.A. graduation in 1849. In the years to 1855 he made four long trips to Madeira. In 1857 Wollaston returned to the North Atlantic islands, investigating the natural history of the Canary Islands ‚Äì with Richard Thomas Lowe and John Edward Gray in 1858, returning with Lowe alone in 1859. After a long and rather mysterious absence he returned to the islands in 1866, this time to Cape Verde Islands with Lowe and Gray. Wollaston was a frequent correspondent with the geologist Charles Lyell and their letters are in the Centre for Research Collections, Edinburgh University Library. Wollaston was also a friendly correspondent with Charles Darwin until 1860. His last trip was to St. Helena with his wife, and Gray. In 1869, Wollaston married Edith, the youngest daughter of his friend Joseph Shepherd.Woodward, Bernard Barham (1900). \\"Wollaston, Thomas Vernon\\".

It was first opened on November 10, 1968, by, then, the Governor of the state of S√£o Paulo, Abreu Sodr√©. The tollway name was given in memory of former military leader Field Marshal Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco, who served as President of Brazil during the military dictatorship. Running westbound from the city of S√£o Paulo and finishing in Esp√≠rito Santo do Turvo, while heading towards the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, near the northern border of the southern state of Paran√°, 'Rodovia Castelo Branco, as it is popularly known, is about long, and one of Brazil's safest tollways. The tollway passes by several cities, including: Barueri, Santana de Parna√≠ba, S√£o Roque, Sorocaba, Tatu√≠, Avar√© and √Åguas de Santa B√°rbara. Near Barueri and due to the large population of S√£o Paulo, Rodovia Castelo Branco is one of the busiest and widest of Brazil's tollways. Initially known as Rodovia do Oeste (Western Expressway), it was built in three phases. The first phase was during 1963 to 1968 (from the city of S√£o Paulo to the city of Torre de Pedra, extending 170 km west). The second phase was during 1971, reaching the city limits of S√£o Manuel and Avar√© (another 58 km). The final and third phase, for 74 km, ended at highway SP-225, near the city of Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo. Travelers going to Ourinhos and the Northwest part of the State of Paran√° often follow the Castelo Branco (SP-225) route. The tollway is managed and maintained by a state concession to three private companies: SPVias, Rodovias das Colinas and ViaOeste.  System Castelo-Raposo  Together with the Raposo Tavares Highway (SP-270), it links the capital of S√£o Paulo to the western interior of the state, known as the Castelo-Raposo System. It also allows access to the Midwest and North regions of Brazil and neighboring countries (Bolivia and Peru) by interconnecting with the Marechal Rondon Highway (SP-300), made by the Jo√£o Hyp√≥lito Martins Highway (SP-209), which connects the Castle to the city of Botucatu. The Castle is also a route to the southern region of the country (western Paran√°) and countries like Paraguay and Argentina. The concessionaire CCR ViaOeste estimates that around 100 thousand vehicles will travel through the Castelo-Raposo System on a daily basis. The operation is monitored by the 78 cameras linked to the Concessionary's Operational Control Center (CCO) and also by the Integrated Control Center (CCI) of Artesp.

Bazhenov and his associates Matvey Kazakov and Ivan Starov were the leading local architects of the Russian Enlightenment, a period dominated by foreign architects (Charles Cameron, Giacomo Quarenghi, Antonio Rinaldi and others). According to Dmitry Shvidkovsky, in the 1770s Bazhenov became the first Russian architect to create a national architectural language since the 17th century tradition interrupted by Peter I of Russia.Shvidkovsky, 2007 p. 260 Bazhenov's early success was followed by a tragic professional and private life. His two main construction projects were abandoned for political or financial reasons. His magnum opus, the neoclassical Grand Kremlin Palace, was cancelled shortly after groundbreaking. The imperial palace in Tsaritsyno Park fell victim to the Battle of the Palaces; Bazhenov's palace core was demolished on the orders of Catherine II. Another project, for the Moscow State University building, ended in a bitter conflict with Bazhenov's former benefactor Prokofi Demidov and led Bazhenov into bankruptcy. Before his death, Bazhenov implored his children to stay aside from the treacherous construction business. Bazhenov's legacy remains debated. The attributions of Pashkov House and lesser projects to Bazhenov, backed by a sketchy paper trail, deductions and conjectures, are uncertain to the point where his life and work became subject of conspiracy theories.For example, Even his place of birth and the location of Bazhenov's grave are unknown. His life story, as reconstructed by Igor Grabar and popularized by the historians of the Soviet period, is regarded by modern critics as the \\"Bazhenov myth\\", and even most recent academic researchGerchuk, 2001 fails to replace this myth with a reliable biography. Biography =Early career= 1764 artwork by Bazhenov The exact year and place of Bazhenov's birth is uncertain; he was born in 1737 or 1738 in a family of a church clerk either in Moscow or in the village of Dolskoye near Maloyaroslavets. According to the second version, the family relocated to Moscow when Vasily was three months old. In 1753 Vasily volunteered (but was not formally hired) into the Kremlin- based architectural company of Dmitry Ukhtomsky, then the only Moscow institution providing basic architectural training. There Bazhenov acquired practical construction skills; poverty forced him to seek paid work instead of classroom training. In 1755 Bazhenov joined the first class of the newly opened Moscow State University. Bazhenov's first biographer, Eugene Bolkhovitinov (1767‚Äì1837, Metropolitan of Kiev since 1822), wrote that Bazhenov also studied at the Slavic Greek Latin Academy but this opinion is firmly refuted by 20th century biographers.Ritsarev, p. 71 Bolkhovitinov, perhaps, knowingly twisted the facts to raise the prestige of clerical colleges.Ritsarev, pp. 71, 73 In the beginning of 1758 the University, requested by Ivan Shuvalov, dispatched a group of sixteen students, including Bazhenov and Ivan Starov, to Saint Petersburg to continue training at the newly established Imperial Academy of Arts.Voronov, p. 100 They, along with twenty boys selected in Saint Petersburg, became the first class of the Academy. In May 1758 the class was reduced to thirty students (8 nobles and 22 raznochintsy); at the first exam, twenty-year-old Bazhenov ranked first, also being the oldest student; fourteen‚Äìyear‚Äìold Starov ranked seventh while the youngest student, Stefan Karnovich, was only twelve.Voronov, p. 112See the official May, 1758 student roster ranked by grades, reproduced in Voronov, p. 112 Bazhenov, according to his own statement, was assigned to the class of Savva Chevakinsky, chief architect of the Russian Admiralty, worked on the construction of the Saint Nicholas church and became a personal mentor and blood brother of younger Starov.Voronov, p. 113 Three years later Bazhenov and painter Anton Losenko became the first students of the Academy of Arts to be awarded a scholarship out of Russia. Bazhenov trained in Paris at the workshop of Charles De WaillyShvidkovsky 2007, p. 240 (Starov joined him there in October 1762). Bazhenov's entries to the competitions of the French Academy of Architecture were a success; he \\"triumphantly concluded\\" the scholarship, being elected to the Roman Academy of Saint Luke, Academy of Fine Arts of Florence and Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna. Later, Bazhenov became the principal promoter of French neoclassicism in Russia and set the stylistic canon of neoclassical Moscow along the ideas of De Wailly. He returned to Russia in May 1765 possessing \\"unusual and impeccable credentials for a Russian of that day\\"Schmidt 1989, p. 38 and applied for a degree and tenure at the Academy, but the new management had no intention to hire Bazhenov. He was subjected to a rigorous formal examination and was ordered to submit a new graduation project; he had no success with the Academy but was noticed by Catherine II and her son Paul, who commissioned Bazhenov to design and build a private mansion on Kamenny Island. At the end of 1766 Grigory Orlov, then commander of imperial artillery and military engineers, hired Baznenov into his retinue, in the military rank of captain of artillery, and commissioned him the Arsenal in Saint Petersburg. Next year, Bazhenov followed Orlov into Moscow where he would live for most of his remaining life \\"giving a Russian reality to French Classical and Italian Palladian modes to which he was exposed.\\" =Kremlin Palace= Final draft of the palace, 1770 or later (planned structures dark, older structures in light shading). Catherine suggested the idea of rebuilding the decrepit palaces of the Moscow Kremlin into a new government center of the reformed country (in 1767 Moscow hosted an elected congress framing a new code of laws)Shvidkovsky 2007, pp. 242‚Äì243 and Bazhenov eagerly responded; as early as 1767 he produced first drafts of his opus magnum, the utopian Grand Kremlin Palace. Orlov, fascinated by the proposal, rightfully questioned the feasibility of the enormous edifice, but Baznenov went forward and finalized the design by the end of summer of 1768. The largest neoclassical complex in Europe,Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 243 if ever completed, would have replaced the Kremlin itself, leaving only its cathedrals intact. According to his plan, the new four‚Äìstorey neoclassical palace would take up the whole southern side of the Kremlin - 2,100 feetSchmidt 1989, p. 40 or 630 meters from Konstantino-Yeleninskaya tower in the east to Borovitskaya Tower in the west, and extending north along the western wall of the Kremlin up to the Arsenal. The palace would have completely enclosed the Kremlin Cathedrals, obstructing their view from across the Moskva River. Instead of building the palace on the top plateau of the Kremlin Hill, Bazhenov placed it right on the steep slope between the plateau and the Kremlin wall slated for demolition, employing enormous stone buttresses to prevent it from sliding into the river. The river itself should have been cleaned up, regulated and flanked by an embankment sided with logs.Schmidt 1989, p. 104 Layout of the new Kremlin \\"was the most inventive planning effort of Catherine's reign\\". Bazhenov retained the historical Cathedral Square and proposed creation of a new square in the eastern part of the Kremlin that would become the new center of Moscow and the start of three new radial streets projecting due north, north-west and north-east. The northern radius, passing through a planned opening in the Kremlin wall, would directly connect the palace with Tverskaya Street.Pamyatniki 1983, p. 287 Bazhenov expanded his planning into modernizing the city itself, which eventually led to the Projected Plan officially accepted in 1775, a joint effort led by Pyotr Kozhin and Nicholas Legrand.Schmidt 1989, p. 44 Nikolay Karamzin wrote in 1817 that \\"plans of Bazhenov, the famous architect, are similar to Plato's Republic or More's Utopia: they should be admired in thought and never put into practice.\\" - Karamzin, 1817, In the same paragraph Karamzin bitterly ridiculed the archaic and pompous language of inscriptions made on the model. Nevertheless, the project received a go‚Äìahead and the government set up the Kremlin Construction Board (or Expedition in 18th century parlance), an institution that survived into the 19th century. The Expedition became a new architectural school for local students, starting with Bazhenov's aide Matvey Kazakov. Kazakov, working in Kremlin since 1768, became Bazhenov's equal after 1770 and took over management of the Expedition in 1786.Schmidt 1989, p. 50Unlike Bazhenov, Kazakov left a standing legacy inside the Kremlin, the Senate building. He surpassed Bazhenov as educator, revitalized Ukhtomsky school and trained Joseph Bove, Ivan Yegotov and Aleksey Bakarev.Schmidt 1989, p. 34 At the groundbreaking ceremony (1773) Bazhenov declared that \\"today we renew old Moscow\\"., - Pamyatniki 1983, p. 293 Work commenced by shaving of the southern slope of the Kremlin Hill and laying foundation for the supporting buttresses. Central part of the southern wall of Kremlin, Taynitskaya and First Unnamed towers were demolished. Earth pit began right next to the Cathedral of the Archangel and for the next year Bazhenov and his engineers struggled with the threat of landslides.Pamyatniki 1983, p. 293 In 1775 Catherine shut down the project, citing damage to the Cathedral of the Archangel and the unsuitable geology of the Kremlin Hill. Historians reason that she had other, more important concerns: enormous cost of the palace and reluctance to invest in Moscow, an old city that she perceived as a threat to her control and modernization of the Empire, the demise of constitutional assemblyShvidkovsky 2007, p. 244 or the simple fact that by 1775 \\"Catherine had nothing more to prove.\\" The original wooden model of the planned palace (1:44 scale, 17 meters long), made by Bazhenov's studentsSchmidt, p. 33: \\"Making models doubtless consumed these students' time; one may imagine budding young architects working long hours on Bazhenov's wooden model...\\" is preserved at the Moscow Museum of Architecture. The photograph shows eastern side of the palace (about a third of its total length) as viewed from the river. When the museum was based at the Donskoy monastery the model was publicly displayed in its main cathedral. In 2001 City of Moscow proposed building a dedicated museum pavilion to display the model in Alexander Garden but the proposal was rejected. =Tsaritsyno= Bazhenov's 1776 panorama of Tsaritsyno Bazhenov, at least in the first half of Catherine's reign, perfectly understood her taste and stylistic program, that of Age of Enlightenment rather than of Neoclassicism.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 259 During the 1775 celebrations of the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca on the Khodynka Field, Bazhenov \\"turned imitation of English Gothic Revival into an attempt to create a universal stylistic language for Russian architecture combining typical elements of medieval buildings of both East and West, motifs from Antiquity and pure fantasy.\\" This ephemeral work paved way to Catherine's decision to build twoPamyatniki 2007, p. 227 imperial palaces in Moscow suburbs (in 1775 she lived in a temporary wooden building in Kolomenskoye). The lesser Petrovsky Castle on the road to Saint Petersburg was awarded to Kazakov, the larger Tsaritsyno to Bazhenov.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 261 In summer of 1775 Bazhenov designed the first draft of Tsaritsyno, now lost. It followed Catherine's affection to \\"peasant style\\", featuring numerous neo-Gothic, country style lodges scattered on a carefully planned \\"natural\\" landscape. The same approach was employed in the second, \\"completely non-classical\\" master plan approved by Catherine in spring of 1776. This time Bazhenov added a dominant main palace, designed as two identical buildings connected with a greenhouse. One wing was intended for Catherine, another for her son and heir Paul. Bazhenov planned to decorate Tsaritsyno with traditional Russian coloured tiles, izraztsy, but Catherine objected and insisted on a simpler red (brick walls), white (ornaments) and yellow (glazed roof tiles) colour scheme. Roof tiles did not last long in Russian winters and were soon replaced with sheet iron. Figurny Bridge, the earliest completed structure (1776), also features the finest ornamental work. Bazhenov began construction with the \\"front row\\" of small buildings, gates and bridges. Their white stone inserts feature finely carved ornaments that disappeared in later buildings either due to shortage in skilled craftsmen or Bazhenov's own stylistic decision.Pamyatniki 2007, p. 228 In 1777 Bazhenov demolished the old wooden manor house of the Cantemirs, former owners of Tsaritsyno, and started construction of the main palace. Shortage of government funds plagued the project from the start; in fact, most of Bazhenov's written legacy consists of business letters pleading the state treasury for money, skilled labor, and counting his private debts incurred in Tsaritsyno. In 1783 he actively sought new jobs, writing that \\"he was now quite free in Tsaritsyno.\\" - Panukhina 1994. The main palace, with an added central annex for Paul's children, was built in eight years. Governor Jacob Bruce, who inspected Tsaritsyno in 1784, was puzzled by the absence of a formal front courtyard, but nevertheless sent Catherine an enthusiastic report praising, in particular, bridges and landscaping. Catherine suddenly visited Tsaritsyno in June 1785, and left displeased by slow pace of the work; she scorned the palace in letters to Paul and Melchior Grimm as a \\"dark place with low vaults and narrow stairs, unfit for living.\\" By 1785 Bazhenov's palace layout became politically incorrect: relations between Catherine and Paul irreversibly worsened, the empress entertained removing Paul from the order of succession completely, and twin palaces had to make way for a single one ‚Äì her own. Catherine announced her will to demolish and rebuild the main palace, but Bazhenov was not fired immediately; he and Kazakov were ordered to submit independent redesign proposals. Bazhenov presented a new design in the end of 1785, but it was rejected and Bazhenov was dismissed from the project \\"to improve his health and household matters\\". - Pamyatniki 2007, p. 228 In February 1786 Catherine finally awarded Tsaritsyno project to Kazakov;Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 282 Bazhenov's palace was demolished in summer of 1786. Public opinion incorrectly connected her anger to Bazhenov's association with the Free MasonsShvidkovsky 2007, p. 281 or his Gothic styling; in fact, Kazakov retained both Gothic and Masonic features and most of Bazhenov's auxiliary buildings survived to date.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 252 =Demidov affair= By the middle of 1780s Catherine, once fascinated by the art of Bazhenov and Charles Cameron, settled for the different version of neoclassicism professed by Kazakov in Moscow and Starov and Quarenghi in Saint Petersburg.Schmidt 1989, p. 4 In December 1786 Bazhenov finally retired from state service and had to rely on private commissions alone. The extent of these private jobs, once considered to be numerous (see attribution problem) has been subsequently revised to a very small number of more or less reliably attributed buildings; in contrast, Matvey Kazakov's legacy of the same period has been documented far better. Shvidkovsky noted that Bazhenov set the style of neoclassical Moscow but it was Kazakov and his alumni who actually designed and built it.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 246 According to Shvidkovsky, residential Moscow before the fire of 1812 was influenced, through Bazhenov, by works of Charles de Wailly and his circle; Bazhenov enhanced the French style with use of sculpture and garden architecture. Kazakov lacked Bazhenov's refinement but his buildings \\"were considerably more practical than Bazhenov's, more adapted to Moscow life.\\"Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 249 Bazhenov, eager to improve his finances, accepted what looked like a generous offer from Prokofi Demidov, a wealthy and whimsical patron of arts. Demidov planned to donate a new building to Moscow University; he agreed to refinance Bazhenov's debts in exchange for his design and management services. Relations soon turned sour; Demidov, literally having Bazhenov in his pocket, rejected his design for a downtown campus and ordered Bazhenov to design a new green field campus on the Sparrow Hills. This cat and mouse game (as presented in Bazhenov's own writing) continued for nearly a decade; the architect wasted years on a dead end project and remained bankrupt at the mercy of Demidov. Once again Kazakov picked up the job and completed the \\"old\\" downtown core of the University in 1793.Pamyatniki 1989 (Bely Gorod), p. 99 In 1792 Bazhenov relocated to Saint Petersburg and accepted an uninspiring but stable job of an architect of Kronstadt admiralty; in his spare time he translated the complete works of Vitruvius. In April 1792 Bazhenov was impicated in the Nikolay Novikov affair; police found Bazhenov's letter to Novikov about supplying masonic books to Paul.Murrell, p. 107 Novikov spent four years in Schlisselburg fortress jail while Bazhenov escaped free. Masonic influence over Bazhenov's life and art led to him being called \\"the Russian Christopher Wren\\"Akinsha et al., p. 29 and the theory that he was a long-term agent of martinists tasked with winning Paul's support.Akinsha et al., pp. 29-30 Paul was aware of Bazhenov's real or alleged mission but by 1792 he stepped aside from freemasonry and personally warned Bazhenov against further conspiracies., ch. II =Late recognition= Emperor Paul I of Russia supported Bazhenov as one of the alleged victims of his despised mother. Shortly upon ascension to the throne (1796) Paul summoned Bazhenov to Saint Petersburg and made him vice-president of the Imperial Academy of Arts. The Academy of this period, influenced by the ideas of its second President Ivan Betskoy, admitted boys at the age of six to nine years old, and provided nine-year general (elementary and secondary) education followed by at least six years of professional training in arts and architecture.Lisovsky, p. 23 Bazhenov believed that the Academy must dispose with elementary education and focus on its core subjects, admitting literate teenagers who could prove their talent in an open contest. He did not live enough to materialize this program; it was gradually implemented by Alexander Stroganov (1802) and Alexey Olenin (1830).Lisovsky, pp. 27, 30 Paul's main construction project, Saint Michael's Castle, was awarded to his house architect, Italian Vincenzo Brenna, while Bazhenov was appointed to supervise Brenna. Historians of the 19th and early 20th centuries could not clearly separate the input of each architect and attributed the design to Brenna and Bazhenov jointly. Nikolay Lanceray (1930s) and subsequent Russian historians give full credit to Brenna; according to Lanceray, Bazhenov did not interfere in Brenna's designs that were, to a large extent, Brenna's renditions of Paul's own romantic vision.Lanceray, p. 85 According to Dmitry Shvidkovsky, Bazhenov worked on an earlier design of the castle and this fact was later interpreted as his participation in actual design; Brenna \\"was given the task of adapting Bazhenov's design\\" but created an independent work.Shvidkovsky 2007, p. 294 At any rate, Bazhenov died in the middle of the project leaving Brenna in full control; the castle turned out not a Neoclassical building, but \\"a rare example of an imperial palace genuinely redolent of the Romantic era.\\"Shvidkovsky, p. 295 Paul also commissioned Bazhenov to design a new hospital near Danilov Monastery. Bazhenov, again, responded with an extravagant plan that did not proceed past wooden frame and was replaced by Kazakov's extant Pavlovskaya Hospital built in 1802‚Äì1807.Schmidt 1989, p. 121The hospital became Kazakov's last significant job. In the process he was accused of mismanaging state money, and fired into retirement. Shortly before his death Bazhenov began compilation of an album on Russian Architecture, collecting drafts of \\"all large buildings in two capitals.\\"Schmidt 1989, p. 54 Attribution problem Pashkov House Yushkov House Dolgov House Church in Starki Reliable attribution of private 18th-century buildings in Russia, even those that retained original styling and floorplans, is rarely possible. Wealthy patrons eagerly hired architects who made themselves famous by working on government megaprojects, but in many instances original drawings are missing.Cracraft, Rowland p. 68 In these cases historians used general design features or specific features to deduce probable author. Uncertainty led to frequent misattribution, particularly in case of Bazhenov and Kazakov and subsequent changes in attribution or admitting inability to make one. =Buildings in Moscow= Attribution of specific Moscow buildings to Bazhenov in this article is based on the academic Pamyatniki arhitektury Moskvy () series of books issued in 1983‚Äì2007. Tradition of the first half of the 20th century, started by Igor Grabar, credited Bazhenov with designing numerous high-profile private buildings in Moscow. Later research has shown that in most cases his input cannot be reliable ascertained. Pashkov House, most likely, has been designed by Bazhenov while other residences once credited to him are now listed under \\"unknown architect\\" heading. * Pashkov House, Bazhenov's most conspicuous extant building and \\"one of Moscow's most graceful and handsome residential ensembles\\"Schmidt 1989, p. 77 is attributed to him \\"through the 19th century tradition supported by the majority of <20th century> researchers\\".Pamyatniki 1989 (Bely Gorod), p. 55 Pashkov House, uniquely to 18th-century architecture, retains its original external appearance and layout as conceived by the architect around 1784 and completed in 1787. The building was severely damaged by the Fire of 1812 and, for the first time in the history of Moscow, was rebuilt exactly to original drafts in recognition of its landmark significance.Pamyatniki 1989 (Bely Gorod), p. 57 * Yushkov House on Myasnitskaya Street in Moscow (late 1780s ‚Äì early 1790s) is simply \\"attributed\\" to Bazhenov. According to Schmidt, it represented architect's turn from French neoclassicism to Italianate architecture.Schmidt 1989, p. 96 Layout of this building, featuring a corner rotunda, became a widely copied standard for neoclassical architects in Moscow.Pamyatniki 1989 (Bely Gorod), p. 251 The building later housed Palace School of Architecture and Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1844‚Äì1918), VKHUTEMAS (1918‚Äì1930)Pamyatniki 1989 (Bely Gorod), p. 253 and, since 1989, Russian Academy of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. * Razumovsky House on Vozdvizhenka Street, another corner rotunda completed in 1799, has been attributed to Bazhenov by Schmidt,Scmidt 1989, p. 88 but Russian sources agree on inability to ascertain architect's identity.Pamyatniki 1989 (Bely Gorod), p. 79 * Tutolmin House in Tagansky District has been attributed to Bazhenov by Igor Grabar; later researchers attributed it to Starov.Schmidt 1989, p. 109 Prior to rebuilding in 1900s, the building's landmark role rivalled that of Pashkov House.Pamyatniki 1989 (Zemlyanoy Gorod), pp. 316-317 Same attribution uncertainty applied to now demolished Prozorovsky House on Bolshaya Polyanka Street, \\"one of most charming estate houses in this street.\\"Schmidt 1989, p. 112Pamyatniki 1994, p. 132 * The Dolgov House in Bolshaya Ordynka Street, has been once attributed to Bazhenov based on the fact that his wife was related to the owner of the building. This opinion has been since discarded.Pamyatniki 1994, p. 203 * The belltower of the Church of All Sorrows in Bolshaya Ordynka Street, across Dolgov House, is unconditionally attributed to Bazhenov while the church itself has been built by Joseph Bove in 1828‚Äì1833.Pamyatniki 1994, p. 204Schmidt 1989, p. 174 * Panukhina (1994) suggested that Bazhenov could have been involved in the late stages of construction of Moscow Kriegskomissariat (present-day headquarters of Moscow Military District) in Zamoskvorechye, designed by Nicholas Legrand.Panukhina, p. 24 =Country estates and churches= Even less certainty applies to attribution of country estates and churches: * The best known of these, in Bykovo, belonged to , Governor of Moscow and Bazhenov's direct superior.Murrell, p. 142 Probable extant Bazhenov's works there include the main mansion and neo-Gothic , while most of 18th-century buildings have been lost.Murrell, pp. 142‚Äì143 * A church in Starki (present-day Kolomensky District), estate of prince Cherkassky, built in 1759‚Äì1763, was one of the first Gothic Revival buildings in Russia. If attribution to Bazhenov is correct, he designed it while still a student at the Academy of Arts.Murrell, p. 150 * Church of Annunciation in Polivanovo, former Razumovsky estate, is \\"typical to Bazhenov\\" which fact remains the sole ground for attribution.Murrell, p. 48 * Neoclassical Church of Theotokos of Vladimir in Dolgoprudny (1772‚Äì1777), with an unusual triangular layout, has been attributed to either Kazakov or BazhenovMurrell, p. 238 despite complete lack of written evidence.Pamyatniki 2004, p. 197 Layout of the church is most likely inspired by the Temple of War by Jean-Francois Nefforge.

Taking place in an Ancient Egypt setting, players assume the role of a pharaoh warrior who embarks on a journey to save his wife while fighting against mythical beings and Egyptian gods. The game was a commercial success for Gaelco and garnered positive reception from critics.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Big Karnak is a platform game reminiscent of Trojan and Ghouls 'n Ghosts, where players assume the role of a pharaoh warrior who embarks on a journey through four increasingly difficult levels taking place in an Ancient Egypt setting to save his wife by defeating the Egyptian gods Horus, Nut, Isis and Osiris.Big Karnak arcade flyer (Gaelco, ESP)Big Karnak manual (Arcade, ESP) During gameplay, players fight against mythical beings, acquire different weapons, solve puzzles and jump between front and back movement planes while avoiding hazards along the way. Players can also deflect certain enemy projectiles to avoid damage. Losing all the energy results in losing a live and the game is over once all lives are lost but players can insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Development  Big Karnak was created under the working title El Fara√≥n by a small team at Gaelco, a Spanish game development company co-founded in 1985 by former Tecfri members Luis Jonama, Josep Quingl√©s and Javier Valero, serving as one of their first arcade projects alongside Master Boy. Gaelco decided to work on a horizontal-scrolling arcade game similar to Double Dragon, Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja and Ghouls 'n Ghosts, recruiting writer Toni L√≥pez Yeste to create the artwork, scripts and animation. Yeste studied comics and illustrations at Escola Joso in Barcelona before being proposed by the school to work at Gaelco, despite never having contact with video games until then. Yeste began writing the script for what would later become Big Karnak in June 1988 and he stated that once the script was shown, Gaelco realized it would work and production of the project began in September of that year. Yeste went to arcades in order to check recent games on the market and study them, with Ghouls 'n Ghosts being the title he studied the most but did not knew Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja until production started. Jonama stated in a 2014 interview with the Spanish version of Retro Gamer that he, Quingl√©s and Valero initially started programming but later directed the games as they grew, with Jonama collaborating on the project as a programmer alongside Albert Sunyer while Quingl√©s specialized on sound design. Julian Goicoa was in charge of marketing the game worldwide but also acted as director and proposed changes from a commercial viewpoint. Artist Xavier Arrebola G. also created artwork for the game with Yeste. Arrebola was first introduced to video games Asteroids during his college days and joined Gaelco in 1989 when Big Karnak was in a more advanced development state due to his interest with computer graphics, being in charge of both character animations and level design. Yeste stated that when production started, several elements from the original script for Big Karnak were added or scrapped due to either not working in the game or being deemed too difficult. Arrebola also stated that team members gave their ideas during development, as equipment and resources were limited, with Yeste claiming that enemies which broke the Egyptian esthetic was due to the collaborative effort. Yeste also claimed a total of eight levels were originally envisioned but the number was ultimately reduced to four. When designing the carnivorous plant enemies for a level, Arrebola was inspired by Frank Oz's Little Shop of Horrors. Jonama and the team used PCs with ARPA, an in-house tool created by Gaelco that allowed artists transpose their hand- drawn animation work from graph paper into pixel art.  Release  Big Karnak was released on arcades by Gaelco in 1991. The game was presented on various trade shows across Europe such as the 1991 European Computer Trade Show. The title was never ported to other systems.  Reception and legacy  According to the book Video Games Around the World, Big Karnak \\"achieved great success\\" commercially. David Wilson of Zero magazine rated the game with a 4.5 out of 5 score. Martin Gaksch of German magazine Power Play gave the title a positive outlook. Oldies Rising scored it 15 out of 20. In 2015, David Martinez of Hobby Consolas also gave it a positive outlook. As of April 2020, the rights to Big Karnak were acquired by Piko Interactive.

It was initially developed in the Manhattan Project during World War II to find extremely small leaks in the gas diffusion process of uranium enrichment plants. It typically uses a vacuum chamber in which a sealed container filled with helium is placed. Helium leaks out of the container, and the rate of the leak is detected by a mass spectrometer.  Detection technique  Helium is used as a tracer because it penetrates small leaks rapidly. Helium has also the property of being non-toxic, chemically inert and present in the atmosphere only in minute quantities (5 ppm). Typically a helium leak detector will be used to measure leaks in the range of 10 to 10 Pa¬∑m¬∑s. A flow of 10 Pa¬∑m¬∑s is slightly less than 1 ml per minute at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP). A flow of 10 Pa¬∑m¬∑s is slightly less than 3 ml per century at STP.  Types of leaks  Typically there are two types of leaks in the detection of helium as a tracer for leak detection: residual leak and virtual leak. A residual leak is a real leak due to an imperfect seal, a puncture, or some other hole in the system. A virtual leak is the semblance of a leak in a vacuum system caused by outgassing of chemicals trapped or adhered to the interior of a system that is actually sealed. As the gases are released into the chamber, they can create a false positive indication of a residual leak in the system.  Uses  Helium mass spectrometer leak detectors are used in production line industries such as refrigeration and air conditioning, automotive parts, carbonated beverage containers food packages and aerosol packaging, as well as in the manufacture of steam products, gas bottles, fire extinguishers, tire valves, and numerous other products including all vacuum systems.  Test methods  = Global helium spray = This method requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested will be located in some kind of a tent in which the helium concentration will be raised to 100% helium. If the part is small the vacuum system included in the leak testing instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation. If the size of the part is too large, an additional vacuum pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation. If leakage is encountered the small and \\"agile\\" molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered. = Local helium spray = This method is a small variation from the one above. It still requires the part to be tested to be connected to a helium leak detector. The outer surface of the part to be tested is sprayed with a localized stream of helium tracer gas. If the part is small the vacuum system included in the instrument will be able to reach low enough pressure to allow for mass spectrometer operation. If the size of the part is too large, an additional pumping system may be required to reach low enough pressure in a reasonable length of time. Once operating pressure has been reached, the mass spectrometer can start its measuring operation. If leakage is encountered the small and \\"agile\\" molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator of the value of the leakage encountered. Thus correlation between maximum leakage signal and location of helium spray head will allow the operator to pinpoint the leaky area. = Helium charged vacuum test = In this case the part is pressurized (sometime this test is combined with a burst test, i.e. at 40 bar) with helium while sitting in a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber is connected to a vacuum pumping system and a leak detector. Once the vacuum has reached the mass spectrometer operating pressure, any helium leakage will be measured. This test method applies to a lot of components that will operate under pressure: airbag canisters, evaporators, condensers, high-voltage SF6 filled switchgear. = Partial vacuum method (ultra sniffer test) = In contrast to the Helium charged sniffer test, the partial vacuum method, the ultra sniffer test gas method (UST-method) uses the partial vacuum effect, so that the gas tightness of test sample can be detected at normal pressure with the same sensitivity as the helium charged vacuum test with helium gas helium. The method has a sensitivity of 10 Pa¬∑m¬∑s. Similar to the classical Helium charged sniffer test the test sample is enclosed in a bag, but in contrast to the classic method, the bag is exposed with a helium-free gas, so that the helium concentration inside the bag can reduced from 5¬∑10 to 10 Pa¬∑m¬∑s. This sensitivity corresponds to a theoretical gas loss of 1 cm in 3000 years. The UST method can be used very economically for the ad hoc testing of test samples. The test system can be set up easily, with normal pneumatic items, such as valves and plastic hoses. For the embedding of the test samples, a simple plastic bag is sufficient. The UST method was also used for the leak testing of component of the fusion experiment Wendelstein 7-X in Germany. = Bombing test = This method applies to objects that are supposedly sealed. First the device under test will be exposed for an extended length of time to a high helium pressure in a \\"bombing\\" chamber. If the part is leaky, helium will be able to penetrate the device. Later the device will be placed in a vacuum chamber, connected to a vacuum pump and a mass spectrometer. The tiny amount of gas that entered the device under pressure will be released in the vacuum chamber and sent to the mass spectrometer where the leak rate will be measured. This test method applies to implantable medical devices, crystal oscillator, saw filter devices. This method is not able to detect a massive leak as the tracer gas will be quickly pumped out when test chamber is pumped down. = Helium charged sniffer test = In this last case the part is pressurized with helium. The mass spectrometer is fitted with a special device, a sniffer probe, that allows it to sample air (and tracer gas when confronted with a leak) at atmospheric pressure and to bring it into the mass spectrometer. This mode of operation is frequently used to locate a leak that has been detected by other methods, in order to allow for parts repair. Modern machines can digitally remove the helium two decades below the background level and thus it is now possible detect leaks as small as 5¬∑10 Pa¬∑m¬∑s in sniffing mode.

It was amalgamated into the city of Hamilton in 2001. Since 2001, hundreds of new homes have been built in Binbrook, separated from Hamilton by conservation and agricultural lands. History Armstrong's General Store was a longtime centre of community activity as was the feed mill. In the 1960s, Cybulski's Grocery Store became a hub for the small community. Knox Presbyterian Church, as well as a Baptist church, and Anglican Church all are near the centre of the village. The community of Binbrook has a rich history of agriculture and First Nations peoples. There has been evidence found of Algonquin tribes inhabiting this area. The first registry of Binbrook is in 1791 when it was called Township #11 in the District of Nassau. The plan can be found in the Department of Lands and Forests, Toronto, dated October 25, 1791, where it lists four concessions and blocks divided amongst several families. Glanbrook Arena in Binbrook Binbrook farmers' market, open seasonally, has become a highly anticipated event that highlights local growers and artisans. The Market takes place at the Fairgrounds which holds a special place in Canadian history as being the host of one of North America's oldest Fall fairs. The Fairgrounds and Agricultural Hall are home to many community events and lay at the centre of the community. The Binbrook Little Theatre, which is across from the Agricultural hall, is home to local productions which highlight the creativity and culture of the area. The theatre gives opportunities to those wanting to explore their acting potential on the stage, and puts on 3 productions a season. The Hamilton Public Library opened the Binbrook branch in April 2018. The community also has a community centre, arena, soccer fields, and the Binbrook Conservation area. As of July 2020 an LCBO opened in town, displacing the Binbrook Food Market as the towns long standing and only retail store selling alcohol. Binbrook Conservation Area The Binbrook Conservation Area is a 396-hectare (978 acre) tract of land owned and operated by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority. Of this area, 174 hectares (430 acres) are covered by picturesque Lake Niapenco. The area was purchased by the NPCA in 1968. The lake was formed after completion of the dam that was built in 1971. The dam was built to augment the summer water flow in the Welland River and to provide seasonal flood control. The lake is surrounded by open meadows, hardwood forests and reforested areas. At one time, there were campgrounds at the conservation area. The old campground access roads now provide the basis for many of the hiking trails at the Binbrook Conservation Area. Recently the Park has had the addition of Wake Boarding offering area residents a chance to enjoy the surf at this otherwise, quiet and serene, lake. Demography The population of Binbrook was 8794 at the Canada 2016 Census. The continued growth has attracted many businesses to the area, including Freshco, Tim Hortons and Shoppers Drug Mart. The community still has its roots in farming and new residents continue to support the local farming community while encouraging the vitality and growth of the village.

This flavor is extremely popular in Japan and other parts of East Asia. Green tea ice cream is also sold in monaka form. It has been available in the United States since the late 1970s, primarily in Japanese restaurants and markets, but is currently moving into mainstream availability. Summary There is a clear indication that Mount Fuji-shaped green tea ice cream was an item on the menu at the royal dinner party during the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912). The true origin of green tea ice cream, however, is unknown. Although green tea itself seems to have existed as local handmade ice cream at some districts in Japan, none of the Japanese flavored ice creams were really merchandised until the 1990s because the major Japanese ice cream manufacturers were producing vanilla, strawberry and chocolate as their primary flavors. However, green tea shaved ice has been well known and popular in Japan long before green tea ice cream. The amount of imported ice cream increased in the Japanese market after the import liberalization act of ice cream in 1990. Sales of Green Tea Ice Cream in Japan began with the importation of green tea ice cream from Maeda-en USA in California with the catch phrase \\"Pure Japanese style made from California\\". It has been produced since April 1995, using fresh California milk made in U.S.A. The same product was soon imported and distributed to convenience stores and supermarkets in Japan as well and it was introduced in some Japanese newspapers. During a certain period of the 1980s in Japan, Meiji Dairies started selling its green tea ice cream with Lady Borden Brand but eventually discontinued selling the product. H√§agen-Dazs Japan started producing green tea ice cream in 1996. The product is now sold in Japanese grocery markets and has become one of the company's most popular flavors. Statistics from the Japanese Ice Cream Association show that green tea ice cream was ranked third in the \\"Favorite Ice Cream Flavor\\" study. In order to prevent a change in color to green tea ice cream (catechin) from sunlight, some containers have lids with an opaque underside. Some green tea ice cream is artificially colored, and others have natural green coloring from the catechin present in green tea. Popularity Green tea ice cream has been available in the United States, the country with the largest ice cream consumption, since the late 1970s, primarily in Japanese restaurants and markets. It is currently becoming mainstream and can also be made at home. The U.S. saw rapid growth in Japanese cuisine and sushi popularity in the mid 1990s, which resulted in a big expansion of the Japanese restaurant business in the U.S. This development gradually helped people learn about green tea, resulting in green tea ice cream becoming a typical dessert. With other dishes Green tea ice cream could easily be integrated into various decorations and arrangements with other ice cream flavors. It could be served with other Japanese sweets such as , , and .

On 12 December 2012, via the official Then Jerico website, Shaw announced details of a 2013 \\"Reprise\\" tour consisting of 13 dates around the United Kingdom, culminating in a show at the Clapham Grand in London. The tour commenced on 7 May 2013, featuring the original line-up of the band, made up of Mark Shaw, guitarists Rob Downes and Scott Taylor, bass player Jasper Stainthorpe and drummer Steve Wren. Shaw continues to tour with a new line-up of Then Jerico. A number of acoustic shows were scheduled to take place in 2018. Acting roles In January 1994, Shaw made his acting debut as Johnny in the London production of Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom by Daniel Abineri. Other activities Shaw was the special guest DJ for \\"The Eighties Nostalgia: Resurrection\\" at The Lexington in London on 27 July and appeared live on-air on the Absolute Radio Christian O'Connell Show for his 1980s \\"Who's Calling Christian\\" feature. In 2003, Shaw appeared in the Reborn in the USA reality television series, but abruptly quit the show after just one day of filming. Shaw was interviewed by Channel 5 about his \\"brief but memorable\\" appearance on Reborn in the USA and the numerous reasons why he walked out of the show on their Most Shocking Talent Show Moments programme which aired in April 2011. He also briefly appeared on Channel 5's Most Shocking Reality TV Moments clip show in September 2014, but was not interviewed. On 10 June 2012, Vintage TV aired a show hosted by Shaw. It aired another show hosted by him on 3 October 2012. On 16 May 2020 Then Jerico appeared remotely on the line-up for the 80s Lockdown Fest organised by Let‚Äôs Rock The Retro Festival. The event raised money for the Child Bereavement UK charity. Discography =Albums= * Almost (EMI, 1991) * Alive & Exposed - as Mark Shaw Etc.

Data extracted from the found in water saturated or nearly saturated with salt. They are also called halophiles, though this name is also used for other organisms which live in somewhat less concentrated salt water. They are common in most environments where large amounts of salt, moisture, and organic material are available. Large blooms appear reddish, from the pigment bacteriorhodopsin. This pigment is used to absorb light, which provides energy to create ATP. Halobacteria also possess a second pigment, halorhodopsin, which pumps in chloride ions in response to photons, creating a voltage gradient and assisting in the production of energy from light. The process is unrelated to other forms of photosynthesis involving electron transport; however, and halobacteria are incapable of fixing carbon from carbon dioxide. Halobacteria can exist in salty environments because although they are aerobes they have a separate and different way of creating energy through photosynthesis. Parts of the membranes of halobacteria are purplish in color. These parts conduct photosynthetic reactions with retinal pigment rather than chlorophyll. This allows them to create a proton gradient across the membrane of the cell which can be used to create ATP for their own use. Some species in this order are used as model organisms to study how some microorganisms can survive in hypersaline environments, understand cellular processes and to research their physiology.  Ecology  = Habitats = Usually, Halobacteriales grow in aerobic and high salinity environments. Halobacteriales have been found in salt lakes, marine salterns, seawater, solar salts and salted food products. Mostly, members of the order Halobacteriales can be located in environments where concentrarion of salt (NaCl) exceeds 25%. However, they can also survive in environments with low concentrations of salt, between 1 and 3.5%. Studies show Halobacteriales can also be found in environments where sulfur reduction takes part as well as in salinity salterns,, seawater black smoker, coastal salt marshes and chimney structures. This results show Halobacteriales only need the enough amount of salt to prevent their lysis and thus can grow in environments with low salinity concentration.

Vanderbilt's Drawing-Room,\\" (1882). The firm of Herter Brothers, (working 1864‚Äì1906), was founded by German immigrants Gustave (1830‚Äì1898) and Christian Herter (1839‚Äì1883) in New York City. It began as a furniture and upholstery shop/warehouse, but after the Civil War became one of the first American firms to provide complete interior decoration services. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers could provide every aspect of interior furnishing--including decorative paneling, mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, carpets and draperies. History High Museum of Art Cabinet, 1875, ebonized cherry, veneer inlays, and metallic foil decorative paper. =Beginnings= Gustave was born illegitimate in 1830, to Johanna Christiana Maria Barbara Hagenlocher and an unnamed father, in Stuttgart, W√ºrttemberg, Germany.Gustave Herter, from American National Biography via Oxford University Press. Five years later, Johanna Hagenlocher married Christian Herter (1807‚Äì1874), a skilled cabinetmaker. Gustave took his stepfather's surname, and later added the \\"e\\" to the end of his given name. His half-brother, Christian Augustus Ludwig Herter, was born in 1839. The boys followed their stepfather/father in the furniture-making trade. Gustave Herter came to New York City in 1848, and by 1858 was working under his own name. Christian was in New York by 1859, and joined his brother in the firm (renamed Herter Brothers) by 1864.Howe, K. S. \\"Gustave and Christian Herter: the European Connection,\\" Magazine Antiques, September 1, 1994. The firm was at the forefront of the panoply of furnishing styles that preceded the Mission style: Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Eastlake, the Aesthetic Movement, ebonized \\"Anglo-Japanese style\\" furnishings of the 1870s ‚Äì 1880s for which the firm is best recognized today, and the wide range of furnishings in revival styles required for Gilded Age houses. =Prominent clients= William Gilman Nichols, director of Herter Brothers from 1891 to 1906Burke, Doreen Bolger, et. al. In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1986, p. 439.; portrait by his brother-in-law, Harry Watrous. Some of the Herter Brothers‚Äô most prominent clients include J. Pierpont Morgan, Jay Gould, Cyrus McCormack. The Red Room of the White House was furnished with Herter Brothers furniture during the administration of Ulysses S. Grant. Several pieces of Herter Brothers furniture remain in the White House including a center table and a slipper chair. This center table bears the remains of the only known Herter Brothers paper label; generally the firm stamped their furniture, a common practice in the 19th Century. Among their most prominent clients were the Vanderbilts. Between 1879 and 1882, Herter Brothers decorated William Henry Vanderbilt's new Fifth Avenue mansion. However, many of the Herter Brothers‚Äô original furnishings were dispersed between 1915-1916, when the house was redecorated. At 634 Fifth Avenue, in 1880‚Äì1882, they decorated the mansion of Darius Ogden Mills, on the site of part of Rockefeller Center now occupied by the colossal bronze Atlas. Their bills came to US$450,000.Harwood, B.R. \\"A Herter Brothers Library Rediscovered\\", Magazine Antiques, May, 2002. At the same time they were furnishing the nearby Jay Gould residence at 579 Fifth Avenue, at Forty- seventh Street. The White House's interiors were extensively renovated during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. Executing the designs of architect Charles Follen McKim, Herter Brothers created the plaster ceiling and ornately carved oak paneling for the expanded State Dining Room. The firm's workshops also provided the heavily carved paneling for the renovated East Room. =Interiors and furniture= The mausoleum of Gustave Herter Very few Herter Brothers interiors remain extant. \\"Elm Park\\" in Norwalk, Connecticut was built 1864-68, and partially decorated by Herter Brothers. Open to the public as the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum, the drawing room, music room and rotunda/art gallery are examples of the Herters' interior design schemes, including lavishly carved and inlaid woodwork and frescoed walls and ceilings. The drawing room was recently restored by John Canning & Co. (formerly John Canning Studios) and retains a suite of Herter furniture purchased for it by the home's second owner, Charles D. Mathews. Furniture from an early Herter commission survives in Victoria Mansion in Portland, Maine. A notable surviving Herter interior is the John Thatcher home, now the Rosemount Museum, in Pueblo, Colorado (however, this work was carried out by the firm after the death of Christian Herter and the retirement of his brother, Gustave; connoisseurs and collectors tend to concentrate on the furniture and interiors designed during the brothers' supervision of the firm). Examples of Herter furniture are in major public collections in the United States.

ZYMV affects all cucurbits including pumpkins, squashes, vegetable marrows, courgettes, melons, watermelons, cucumbers, gherkins and various gourds especially zucchinis. The effects are severe leaf mosaic, yellowing and eventually \\"shoestring\\" symptoms in the leaves. The fruits are stunted, twisted and deformed by raised protuberances, which reduces yield and makes them unmarketable in some cultures. In cultivated crops plants cease producing marketable fruits within 1‚Äì2 weeks of infection and serious financial losses can occur, particularly in courgette and marrow crops. Control The disease may be introduced in infected seed, so sourcing clean seed can help prevent the disease. Control is largely dependent on using insecticides to control the aphid vectors. A form of \\"inoculation\\" or cross protection may also be used where seedlings are inoculated with a non-virulent strain of the virus (ZYMV- WK); this prevents infection with the severe strain. A biotech yellow crookneck squash has been developed to resist zucchini yellow mosaic virus (and watermelon mosaic virus (WMV)). This contains the coat protein genes of the viruses. In 2009, relatively small amounts of this were grown commercially in the US. It is similar to the watermelon mosaic virus.

Together with the A428, the A43 and A34, it forms the route from Cambridge through Milton Keynes to Oxford. The section between the A1 (near St Neots) and the A5 (in Milton Keynes) is a national primary route. Route The road begins at the A1, just south of St Neots (and the junction with the A428 from Cambridge), at the Black Cat Roundabout. The road bypasses both Great BarfordThe Great Barford bypass opened on 24 August 2006. and Bedford to the south to reach the M1 at junction 13. From there, it swings up through the southern part of Milton Keynes, doubling as the local grid road H8 Standing Way. During this time it crosses the A5 (and connects to it via a short spur which is part of the V6 Grafton Street). Continuing westwards, as the route approaches Buckingham the road passes close by to the 14th century Thornborough Bridge, the only surviving mediaeval bridge in Buckinghamshire which was bypassed by the new bridge in 1974. Close to here, it then forms the Buckingham by-pass before joining the A43 (Northampton M40 junction 10) near Brackley. (On crossing the A43, the route due westward becomes the B4031 through Croughton, Aynho and Deddington to join the A361 to Chipping Norton). The section from the A1 to the M1 is dual carriageway and fully grade- separated, with the section between Bedford and the M1 completed in December 2010, winning the British Construction Industry Award in 2011. There is a short 3km section of single carriageway from the new flyover (beside Junction 13) to the south-eastern outskirts of Milton Keynes, where dual carriageway running resumes and continues as far as the southwestern outskirts. From here to the A43, the route is single carriageway, with the exception of the bypass around Tingewick. Developments =M1 Junction 13 to Milton Keynes = In conjunction with the M1 widening schemes and dualling of the A421 between M1 Junction 13 and Bedford (see above), proposals were also put forward to widen the A421 between the M1 junction 13 Bedfordshire and the Kingston roundabout in Milton Keynes. Exhibitions were held in June 2005 which rejected proposals to re-route the road in favour of widening the current road. In 2005 the project was given an estimated total cost of ¬£33 million. Funding of 23.5 million was confirmed by the government for these works, as part of the South East Midlands Local Enterprise Partnership \\"Local Growth Deal\\". As part of the government's pinch point reduction programme, in 2014 work commenced on the A421 in Milton Keynes to improve the Kingston roundabout. That work is now complete. The upgrade work for the final part of the A421, the section running from junction 13 to Kingston, started in September 2018 and is due to be complete by the end of 2020. =Oxford to Cambridge Expressway= The Oxford to Cambridge Expressway is a proposed grade-separated dual carriageway between the A34 near Oxford and the A14 near Cambridge, via (or near) Milton Keynes. The proposal aims to establish this route by linking existing roads and building new ones. The case for its creation is examined in a Strategic Study for the Cambridge ‚Äì Milton Keynes ‚Äì Oxford corridor, published by National Infrastructure Commission in November 2016. The NIC sees the road as being of national strategic importance by providing an outer orbital route around London, linking Southampton, the M3, M4, M40, M1, A1, A14/M11 and Felixstowe. This route will absorb the existing A421 and A428 roads between the A14 and the M1, with a new \\"greenfield\\" route from M1 J13 to the M40 and onwards to the A34, broadly in the East West Rail corridor. , no announcement has been made on the precise route between the M1 and the A34, let alone the numbering of the route (A34, A421, even A428), although the M1 to M40 section is to be broadly parallel with the existing A421 and will replace it.

The light replaced the 1837 lighthouse on Turtle Island at the mouth of the Maumee River. It is an active aid to navigation. The lighthouse is built on a 20-foot-deep (6 m) stone crib, from the mouth of the Maumee River, marking the entrance to the Toledo harbor. It sits about north of Maumee Bay State Park. The need for a lighthouse became apparent after the shipping channel was widened and deepened in 1897 and shipping traffic increased. Construction began in 1901 when the United States Army Corps of Engineers sunk a large crib, filled it with stone, and then topped the portion above water with a concrete base to create an artificial island. Crib construction had been perfected on the Great Lakes on such earlier lights as White Shoal Light, Stannard Rock Light, and Rock of Ages Light, which was developed by Engineer Col. Orlando M. Poe. It is a \\"distinctive lighthouse that some believe resembles a gingerbread house\\". While there is no witch living inside as there was in the tale of Hansel and Gretel, there is an eerie \\"phantom keeper\\" who for years beckoned to mariners from an upper-story window. It stands sentinel to Maumee Bay. The tip of the lantern vent is high above the lake. It has a three-story dwelling and is brick with a steel frame. Its Romanesque style is unique among Great Lakes lighthouses. Built for $152,000, almost as much as Spectacle Reef Light, the most expensive lighthouse on the Great Lakes. The Toledo light was first illuminated on May 23, 1904, by a 3¬Ω-order Fresnel lens that featured a 180-degree bull's-eye, two smaller 60-degree bull's-eyes and a ruby-red half cylinder glass made in Paris by Barbier and Bernard. The engineers next put steel frames in place, providing stability for a three-story brick lighthouse and an attached one- story fog signal building. The dwelling was signed to accommodate one lighthouse keeper and two assistants. It rises . A cylindrical tower has a diameter of 13 feet, upward from the center of the dwelling roof. The lantern room measures in diameter. Helical bars support the glass panes in the onion- domed topped lantern room. The lantern room originally housed an unusual 3 ¬Ω-order Fresnel lens manufactured by Barbier & Benard of Paris. The lens featured a 180-degree bull's-eye, two smaller 60-degree bull's-eyes, and a ruby-red half cylinder of glass, and when revolved produced two white flashes followed by a single red flash. A suspended weight was used to rotate the lens, which first sent forth its penetrating beams of light on the night of May 23, 1904. The lighthouse's original Fresnel lens on display at Maumee Bay State Park Lodge By 1966, an electric motor was installed to rotate the lens, allowing the Toledo Harbor Lighthouse to operate with little human intervention. The last Coast Guard crew could then be removed, but not before measures were taken to prevent vandalism of the now keeperless lighthouse. The security system came in the form of a fully uniformed mannequin, stationed in one of the upper windows of the dwelling. Originally appearing as a man with a penciled mustache, the mannequin later sported a long blond wig. Ghost stories that tell of a phantom lighthouse keeper at Toledo Harbor can usually be traced back to this figure. Even though it sits motionless, some swear that it has beckoned to them from the window. The mannequin has become part of the Coast Guard's tradition, and new officers stationed at Toledo consider it a rite of passage to sign its shirt. Toledo Harbor Lighthouse is still an active aid to navigation. The federal government maintained ownership of the site until 2006, and the US Coast Guard still maintains the navigational light. The Toledo Harbor Lighthouse Society, with help from Duket Architects, filed an application to own the lighthouse on September 20, 2005. On October 5, 2006, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Toledo Harbor Lighthouse Preservation Society application for ownership. The lighthouse is open to the public for special events. In the late 1990s, the original Fresnel lens was removed and eventually placed on display at the COSI museum in Toledo. In its place is a , fed by solar cells. Twice a year, U.S. Coast Guardsmen visit the lighthouse to clean and service the lens, solar panel and backup batteries.Anderson, Kraig, Lighthouse Friends, Toledo Harbor Lighthouse. In 1965, the light was automated by the U.S. Coast Guard and powered by solar cells. To deter vandalism, a uniformed mannequin officer was placed in the window and the boat basin removed. As part of the commemoration of the light's centennial, the Toledo Harbor Lighthouse Society was formed in 2003 as a nonprofit organization to document the history of the lighthouse, preserve the lighthouse and to provide public access. The Toledo Harbor Lighthouse Preservation Society was formed to work for restoration of the lighthouse. Restoration will cost approximately $1.5 million. A grant was awarded in 2010 for windows, doors, shutters and tucking the brick. A 'My Lighthouse Window' capital campaign for the $138,000 match is underway. The infrastructure will include solar, a marine waste water system and a gray water treatment process. Potable water will be boated in. When the restoration is complete, four 'keepers' will stay at the lighthouse to schedule visits to tour the lighthouse. The light's unique form made it the subject of artwork, including paintings. In 2008, the Fresnel lens was relocated to Quilter Lodge in Maumee Bay State Park, which is within sight of the Toledo Harbor Lighthouse on clear days. Toledo Harbor Light House, 1914 It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Reference #83002005, name of Listing: TOLEDO HARBOR LIGHT (U.S. COAST GUARD/GREAT LAKES TR).

Early history  In 1995, shortly after the Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian War, ≈Ωeljko Kopanja co-founded Nezavisne Novine, a weekly independent newspaper, in order to \\"foster improved relationships among Serbs, Muslims and Croats in Bosnia\\". The magazine was funded in part by the United States Agency for International Development, per a part of the Dayton Agreement which had called for funding for non-nationalist media. Beginning with a circulation of 4,000, the newspaper later became a daily, and its circulation climbed to 18,000 in the next five years. In August 1999, Nezavisne Novine broke new ground by reporting on the murder of 200 Muslim civilians by Serbian police officers in 1992. With the report, the paper became the first Bosnian Serb paper to report on war crimes by Bosnian Serbs during the Yugoslav Wars. At the same time, he stated that he \\"stands by the thesis that no nation is genocidal or criminal, but individuals from certain nations are. I think that the Serbian people do not deserve to carry this burden ... I do not allow anyone to commit war crimes in my name or in the name of my people, nor does anyone have the right to do that.\\"  1999 car bomb attack  Following the paper's reporting on atrocities committed by Bosnian Serbs, Kopanja was denounced by some groups as a traitor, and began to receive death threats. On October 22, 1999, he was nearly killed by a car bomb that exploded as he turned the ignition key. A nearby hospital amputated both of his legs. International supporters funded follow-up medical care for him in Austria, as well as high-quality prosthetic legs. The bombing provoked outrage in both Muslim and Serbian media. Srpski Glas joined Nezavisne Novine in printing a mostly blank front page three days after the bombing, carrying only the words \\"We Want to Know\\" to call for further investigation into the attack. Bosnian television interrupted programming to display the same message. The perpetrators were not found, though Kopanja later stated his belief that Serbian security forces were responsible for the attack in retaliation for his reporting on war crimes. An investigation by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation supported his contention. Kopanja continued to edit and write for Nezavisne Novine despite the attack.

Life Planck was born in Stuttgart. He studied at T√ºbingen, where he became doctor of philosophy in 1840 and Privatdozent in 1848. During this period the influence of Reiff led him to oppose the dominant Hegelianism of the time. In 1850-1851 he published his great book, Die Weltalter, in which he developed a complete original system of philosophy, based on the realistic view that thought should proceed from nature to the highest forms of existence in the spiritual life. Not only did Planck oppose the idealism of his confreres; his views were, in another aspect, directly antagonistic to the Darwinian theory of descent, which he specifically attacked in Wahrheit und Flachheit des Darwinismus (N√∂rdlingen, 1872). The natural consequence of this individuality of opinion was that his books were practically disregarded, and Planck was deeply incensed. The ill success of Die Weltalter nerved him to new efforts, and he repeated his views in Katechismus des Rechts (1852), Grundlinien einer Wissenschaft der Natur (1864), Seele und Geist (1871), and numerous other books, which, however, met with no better fate. In the meantime he left T√ºbingen for Ulm, whence he came finally to the seminary of Maulbronn. He died in 1880 in an asylum after a short period of nervous prostration. After his death a summary of his work came into the hands of K√∂stlin (author of Aesthetics, 1869), who published it in 1881 under the title Testament eines Deutschen, Philosophie der Natur und der Menschheit. Planck's views were elaborately developed, but his method of exposition told heavily against their acceptance. He regarded himself as the Messiah of the German people. Beside the works above quoted, he wrote System des reinen Idealismus (1851); Anthropologie und Psychologie auf naturwissenschaftlicher Grundlage (1874); a political treatise, Bismarck : S√ºddeutschland und der deutsche Nationalstaat (1872); and Logisches Causalgesetz und nat√ºrliche Zweckm√§√üigkeit (1874).

It is designed to make high-resolution, microwave-wavelength surveys of the sky in order to study the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). At an altitude of , it is one of the highest permanent, ground-based telescopes in the world. Erected in the (austral) autumn of 2007, ACT saw first light on 22 October 2007 with its science receiver, the Millimeter Bolometer Array Camera (MBAC), and completed its first season in December 2007. It began its second season of observations in June 2008. The project is a collaboration between Princeton University, Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, NASA/GSFC, the Johns Hopkins University, the University of British Columbia, NIST, the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile, the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Cardiff University, Rutgers University, the University of Pittsburgh, Columbia University, Haverford College, West Chester University, INAOE, LLNL, NASA/JPL, the University of Toronto, the University of Cape Town, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and York College, CUNY. It is funded by the US National Science Foundation. Design and location The Atacama Cosmology Telescope viewed from the top of the outer ground screen. The top half of the segmented, primary mirror can be seen above the inner ground screen that moves with the telescope. The ACT is an off-axis Gregorian telescope, with a primary mirror and a secondary mirror. Both mirrors are segmented, consisting of 71 (primary) and 11 (secondary) aluminum panels. Unlike most telescopes which track the rotating sky during observation, the ACT observes a strip of sky, typically five degrees wide, by scanning back and forth in azimuth at the relatively rapid rate of two degrees per second. The rotating portion of the telescope weighs approximately , creating a substantial engineering challenge. A ground screen surrounding the telescope minimises contamination from microwave radiation emitted by the ground. The design, manufacture and construction of the telescope were done by Dynamic Structures in Vancouver, British Columbia. Observations are made at resolutions of about an arcminute (1/60th of a degree) in three frequencies: 145 GHz, 215 GHz and 280 GHz. Each frequency is measured by a , 1024 element array, for a total of 3072 detectors. The detectors are superconducting transition-edge sensors, a new technology whose high sensitivity should allow measurements of the temperature of the CMB to within a few millionths of a degree. A system of cryogenic helium refrigerators keep the detectors a third of a degree above absolute zero. In its currently scheduled survey, the ACT will map about two hundred square degrees of the sky. Because water vapour in the atmosphere emits microwave radiation which contaminates measurements of the CMB, the telescope benefits from its arid, high-altitude site, located in the loftyyet easily accessibleChajnantor plain in the Andean mountains in the Atacama Desert. Several other observatories are located in the region, including CBI, ASTE, Nanten, APEX and ALMA. Science goals The Atacama Cosmology Telescope. In this picture, the ground screen had not yet been completed, allowing the telescope to be seen. Measurements of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) by experiments such as COBE, BOOMERanG, WMAP, CBI and many others have greatly advanced our knowledge of cosmology, particularly the early evolution of the universe. It is expected that higher resolution CMB observations will not only improve the precision of current knowledge, but will also allow new types of measurements. At ACT resolutions, the Sunyaev- Zeldovich effect (SZ), by which galaxy clusters leave an imprint on the CMB, should be prominent. The power of this method of detection is that it is a redshift-independent measurement of the mass of the clusters, meaning that very distant, ancient clusters are as easy to detect as nearby clusters. It is expected that ACT will detect on the order of 100 such clusters. Together with follow-up measurements in visible and X-ray light, this would provide a picture of the evolution of structure in the universe since the Big Bang. Among other things, this would improve our understanding of the nature of the mysterious Dark Energy which seems to be a dominant component of the universe. The South Pole Telescope has similar, but complementary, science objectives. Results ACT released results measuring the statistical properties of the temperature of the CMB down to arcminute scales in January 2010. It found signals that were consistent with un-resolved point sources and the SZ effect. In 2011, ACT made the first detection of the power spectrum of gravitational lensing of the microwave background, which, combined with the WMAP results, has for the first time provided evidence for dark energy from the CMB alone. Measurements of the CMB power spectrum from the South Pole Telescope were subsequently released that were later also shown to provide evidence for dark energy from the CMB alone.

It is one of the country's busiest transportation corridors. A 2005 survey conducted amongst Brazilian truck drivers rated it as the best transportation axis in the country. The Anhanguera Highway connects S√£o Paulo with the northern part of the state and its main industrial cities and one of the most productive agricultural areas. It is one of the most important highways in Brazil and one of the busiest, with the highest traffic segment between S√£o Paulo and Campinas, the first to be built. It is duplicated, containing sections with additional tracks and marginal clues. They have heavy traffic, especially of trucks. It is considered, together with the Bandeirantes Highway and Washington Luis Highway, the country's largest financial corridor, since it interconnects some of the state's metropolitan regions such as S√£o Paulo, Campinas and Ribeir√£o Preto, as well as the Jundia√≠ Urban Aglomerate and the Central Administrative Region. History The route was first used in 1774 as a dirt road between S√£o Paulo city, Jundia√≠ and Campinas, serving the cattle troops and voyagers who explored the backlands for gold, precious stones and slaves. The original road was built in 1914, by a group of 84 forced labor prisoners, who paved 32 km. It is known today as Estrada Velha de Campinas (Campinas Old Road), with the official designation of SP-332. It was officially inaugurated in 1940 as the first modern, asphalt- paved, four-lane highway in the country. Anhanguera was the name given by native indigenous people to a famous bandeirante explorer of the 16th century, Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva, who impressed them with tricks of setting fire to a plate full of cacha√ßa. Anhanguera in the Tupi language means \\"old devil\\". Features The Anhanguera highway connects the city of S√£o Paulo with the northern region of the state and the industrial cities and agricultural regions there. Its busiest section is S√£o Paulo-Campinas, the first section which was inaugurated. It is 86 km long, and serves the cities of Cajamar, Jundia√≠, Louveira, Vinhedo, Valinhos and Campinas. Near Valinhos, SP-330 connects to Rodovia Dom Pedro I through the Campinas Beltway (SP-083), and near Campinas, it connects with Rodovia dos Bandeirantes (SP-348) through Rodovia Santos Dumont (SP-075). Beyond Campinas, the second section goes through the cities of Sumar√©, Nova Odessa, Americana, Limeira, Araras, Leme, Pirassununga, Porto Ferreira, Cravinhos and Ribeir√£o Preto. The third section, the last to be doubled-laned, goes to Orl√¢ndia, S√£o Joaquim da Barra, Guar√°, Ituverava and Igarapava, reaching the border of Minas Gerais state at the Rio Grande, near Uberaba. It is the third longest highway in the state, with 482 km. Anhanguera is a four-lane highway. It has heavy traffic, especially trucks. The highway is currently managed by four private companies, and therefore is a toll road: * AutoBan, from 11 (S√£o Paulo) to 158 km * InterVias, from 158 to 240 km * AutoVias, from 240 to 318 km * ViaNorte, from 318 to 482 none See also * Highway system of S√£o Paulo * Brazilian Highway System References Highways in S√£o Paulo (state) Transport in Campinas ","title":"Rodovia Anhanguera"},{"id":"2831982","text":"Workers Revolutionary Party was a communist group in Kerala, India.

It later came to mean an elected or unelected official of a municipality, or the representative of a borough in the English House of Commons. The term was also used in some of the American colonies. In the Colony of Virginia, a \\"burgess\\" was a member of the legislative body, which was termed the \\"House of Burgesses\\".  Etymology  It was derived in Middle English and Middle Scots from the Old French word burgeis, simply meaning \\"an inhabitant of a town\\" (cf. burgeis or burges respectively). The Old French word burgeis is derived from bourg, meaning a market town or medieval village, itself derived from Late Latin burgus, meaning \\"fortress\\"American Heritage Dictionary etymology or \\"wall\\". In effect, the reference was to the north-west European medieval and renaissance merchant class which tended to set up their storefronts along the outside of the city wall, where traffic through the gates was an advantage and safety in event of an attack was easily accessible. The right to seek shelter within a burg was known as the right of burgess. The term was close in meaning to the Germanic term burgher, a formally defined class in medieval German cities (Middle Dutch burgher, Dutch burger and German B√ºrger). It is also linguistically close to the French term Bourgeois, which evolved from burgeis.  \\"Greensleeves\\" reference  The original version of the well-known English folk song \\"Greensleeves\\" includes the following: > Thy purse and eke thy gay guilt knives, thy pincase gallant to the eye: No > better wore the Burgesse wives, and yet thou wouldst not love me. This clearly implies that at the time when it was composed (late 16th to early 17th century) a burgess was proverbial as being able to provide his wife with beautiful and expensive clothes.

One of the design goals was to use as many standard LS components as possible in order to lower the development costs. This and the large contribution of Wolf Lemke, who performed the aerodynamic and structural calculations, led to Rolladen-Schneider bestowing the type designation LS11 upon the Akafliegers' project. The goal of the project is to design and build a thoroughly capable school glider with top performance for cross-country training, record flying and competition. The LS11 gets its performance from an extended Rolladen- Schneider LS6 wing. After the Akaflieg Darmstadt D-41 demonstrated the feasibility of a high performance, multiplace glider based on the LS6 wing, the K√∂ln Akafliegers felt they could profit from and improve upon that design. The wing structure was redesigned and resembles somewhat the Rolladen- Schneider LS9 structure. The wings, almost entirely made of Carbon fibre Reinforced Plastic, were manufactured at the Rolladen-Schneider factory in Egelsbach in mid-2001, while the span extensions were built in the moulds developed by the Darmstadt group for the D41. The LS11 prototype was featured as a work in progress at the 2003 and 2005 AERO Friedrichshafen exhibitions in Germany. The maiden flight was to be followed by a comprehensive flight test programme in 2006, to be carried out at Akaflieg K√∂ln's home airfield, Dahlemer Binz in the Eifel region in Germany. The LS11 is slated for production by the Slovenian aircraft manufacturer AMS-Flight. =General description= The LS11 is expected to have up to four interchangeable sets of wingtips for spans between 18 and 21 meters. The prototype currently has a 20-meter span in keeping with the new Two-Seater competition class. Water ballast bags inside the wings enable loadings up to 50 kg/m2. Two ballast tanks integrated into the rudder fin will keep the centre of gravity within its optimum range, compensating for ballast changes and heavier pilots. The empty weight was a serious design concern for reasons beyond mere ease of ground handling. As the scope for increasing the wing area was limited, since it originated on a single-seat design, the Akafliegers strove to achieve an empty mass as low as possible, in order to keep the wing loading of the shorter 18 meter span within reasonable limits. Some parts of the fuselage were adapted from existing production types, such as the tail boom of the LS4 and the empennage of the LS8. Considerable redesign was required, however. The span of the horizontal stabiliser was increased; the vertical stabiliser was made both taller and longer, to provide the required steering power while keeping the top of the vertical fin at a height comfortable for the assembly of the horizontal empennage. The cockpit, manufactured from carbon and aramid reinforced plastic, was designed to accommodate pilots up to two meters tall. Available space is sumptuous for both pilots, exceeding that of all comparable production gliders. The front seat is similar to the LS4 cockpit, and both seats have enough leg and elbow room to preclude the mutual interference too often encountered in tandem sailplanes. The maximum cockpit load is 230 kg. The large canopy is a single unit which integrates the instrument panels into the canopy frame. It is hinged at the back in the Piontkowski fashion and opens with an upward and rearward movement. The practicality of this concept for large glider canopies has already been tested by Akaflieg K√∂ln through the modification of three Scheibe SF-34 gliders. The hinge is a carbon reinforced element able to withstand wind speeds up to 75 km/h when open and was designed to sever the tubing and wiring looms from the instrument panels upon emergency release in flight. The airplane stands on a sprung, retractable main undercarriage with a six-inch hub, and a nose wheel which is likewise sprung and retracts simultaneously with the main wheel. A fixed tail wheel is also provided. This undercarriage scheme simplifies ground handling, since fuselage dollies are not required. The main wheel is located near the glider's empty centre of gravity. All controls connect automatically upon assembly in the habitual LS way. The control system is built mostly from standard LS parts. The wings are connected by two main pins inserted into the tongue-and-fork spar ends, as in the LS6 and subsequent LS types. A low landing speed is essential for a trainer. Wolf Lemke and Siegfried Piontowski decided to depart from the typical LS system in which ailerons and flaps act as flaperons, using mixed schedule as featured in the Schleicher ASW 27. In landing configuration the flaps assume a deflection of about 75 degrees while the ailerons remain in a neutral position, enabling slower landing speeds with good control response. Multiblade airbrakes extend from the upper surfaces of the wings to give ample glidepath modulation.

Mackinaw cloth is a heavy and dense water-repellent woolen cloth, similar to Melton cloth but using a tartan pattern, often \\"buffalo plaid\\". It was used to make a short coat of the same name, sometimes with a doubled shoulder. These jackets have their origins on the Canadian frontier and were later made famous by American loggers in the upper Midwest as workwear during the mid-19th century logging boom. Mackinaw blankets are referenced by Josiah A. Gregg in his 1844 book Commerce of the Prairies about trade on the Santa Fe Trail. He notes that these were contraband, subject to confiscation by customs officers, but that they could be concealed between the double layers of Osnaburg sheet fabrics which formed the roof of covered cargo wagons. Origin of the Mackinaw jacket right The Mackinac or Mackinaw region in present-day Michigan was an important trade artery during the 18th and 19th centuries; it was named after the Straits of Mackinac, which connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. A military force at the straits could also command traffic from and to Lake Superior, which drains into the St. Marys River, which in turn empties into Lake Huron east of the straits. Although Fort Mackinac at Mackinac Island had been ceded by Britain to the newly independent United States in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the British Army refused to evacuate the posts on the Great Lakes until 1796, when the forts at Detroit, Mackinac, and Niagara were handed over to the Americans. British and American forces contested the area throughout the War of 1812, and the boundary was not settled until 1828, when Fort Drummond, a British post on nearby Drummond Island, was evacuated. The Mackinaw jacket traces its roots to coats that were made by white and M√©tis women in November 1811, when John Askin Jr., an early trader on the upper Great Lakes, hired them to design and sew 40 woolen greatcoats for the British Army post at Fort St. Joseph (Ontario), near Mackinac. His wife, Madelaine Askin, took an important role in the design of the coat. Askin was fulfilling a contract he received from Capt. Charles Roberts, the post commander; Roberts was desperate to clothe his men, who had last been issued greatcoats in 1807. The jackets were made from three- point trade blankets that Askin, who at the time was keeper of the King's store at the fort, supplied on the captain's authority. Although the order called for blue coats, the number of blue blankets proved insufficient, so the number was filled out by coats made from blankets in red as well as the black- on-red tartan pattern that is associated with the jackets of today. The long skirts of the greatcoat were unsuitable for deep snow, and once these were removed, the Mackinaw jacket was born. Modern use The Beach Boys, 1963. =From workwear to sportswear= In the days of the Old West, heavyweight \\"buffalo plaid\\" tartan Mackinaw jackets were worn with knit caps by American and Canadian lumberjacks in the Midwest, Northwest territories and Alaska. By the 1930s, the jacket had also found widespread use as sportswear among hunters and fishermen, together with a knit cap. A variant of the Mackinaw in olive drab was issued to the US Army for cold weather use by Jeep crews. After the war, plaid jackets of this type, manufactured under the Pendleton brand, became popular casual wear for American men as an alternative to the similar Hollywood jacket. =Use by teenagers= During the 1960s Pendleton overshirts were widely worn by surfers and surf rock groups such as the Beach Boys.. In the late '60s and early '70s \\"Mac\\" jackets became standard apparel that helped defined the image of Vancouver's notorious Park Gangs, whose members came from tough, working class, logging and labouring families. The jacket made another comeback among the 1990s grunge, hardcore punk and skater subcultures due to its cheapness, durability, warmth, and protection from falls when skateboarding. It is also occasionally seen on members of the 2010s hipster subculture due to its practical but timeless feel.

This station was the original terminus of the railway between Adelaide and Port Adelaide, which opened in 1856. Since closure in 1981, the site of the passenger station has been redeveloped as the Port Adelaide Police Station and Magistrates' Court. The former goods yard, adjacent to Lipson Street, is now occupied by the National Railway Museum. There have since been several proposals to rebuild the station, including a failed attempt in 2019.Adelaide's public transport going back to the future under Stephan Knoll ABC News, 21 June 2019. Retrieved 21 June 2019. History The station was opened with the line from Adelaide in April 1856 and for the first sixty years until 1916, it was the only railway station in town and known simply as Port Adelaide. The original station was quite an impressive structure, with a large curved roof over the platforms. Facing St Vincent Street was a two-storey stone building, which also included a tower. The two side platforms were about 120‚Äì150 metres in length each, and the platform architecture was the same as the platforms at the Bowden and Alberton stations. In February 1868 a direct line was built from Dry Creek to Port Adelaide to allow goods and minerals from the state's mid-north and the Murray River to reach the Port directly, without needing to travel via Adelaide. In 1878 a railway was opened from Port Adelaide to Semaphore. This followed a different route to today's line as far as Glanville. The Semaphore line emerged from the western side of Port Adelaide station, travelled down the middle of St Vincent Street and crossed the Port River via the Jervois Bridge before curving to join the current alignment of the Outer Harbor line into Glanville station. Steam trains travelled through Port Adelaide's commercial centre at walking speed, with the locomotive crew ringing a bell. Even at that time this arrangement was unsatisfactory for both local citizens and the railway operators. By the end of the 19th Century the goods yard had become very busy with materials being imported and exported from South Australia via Port Adelaide and there was a large engine shed and turntable to service the various steam locomotives working in the area. A number of railway lines extended from the station yard via city streets to the wharves and various private sidings. Occasional passenger boat trains also travelled directly to the wharves, transferring passengers to and from ocean-going ships which berthed in the inner harbour at the time. Congestion around Port Adelaide yard resulted in the opening of the Rosewater Loop line in November 1915 and construction of the Commercial Road viaduct which opened in 1916. The viaduct line continued over a new bridge across the Port River and joined the existing line to Semaphore and Outer Harbor at Glanville. With the new viaduct, a high level station was opened, called Port Adelaide Commercial Road. The original Port Adelaide station was renamed Port Dock to differentiate the two. After 1916 the frequent trains to and from Adelaide mostly continued through to Semaphore or Outer Harbor via the new line and Commercial Road became the Port's main railway station. Port Dock continued to be served by irregular trains from Adelaide and peak hour workings to Dry Creek via the Rosewater Loop. = Decline = By the second half of the 20th century, the various lines leading through the streets to the wharves were cut back. Wharf access was firstly restricted to the Canal branch, then disconnected completely. The boat train traffic was all transferred to Outer Harbor and in due course was also eliminated. Port Dock Station became something of a backwater. The original buildings and remains of the overall roof were removed in 1963 and replaced with new buildings in the utilitarian style of that era. The station platforms were rebuilt to a length of about 70‚Äì80 metres to accommodate a maximum of three railcars, although it was very rare for a 3-car set to terminate at Port Dock, 2000‚Äì2100 class railcar sets would have only run through here for a year. The station was finally closed on 13 September 1981, with the last train being a 3-car Redhen railcar set. The station platforms were removed in 1987 while the redundant sidings and goods sheds were re-developed as a Bicentennial Project to house the former Mile End Railway Museum. The National Railway Museum opened on its site in Lipson Street on 10 December 1988. =Renewal Proposal= In 2017 there was a proposal for a new railway station to be built near the location of the original site, based on a $16.4 million state budget allocation for a new rail station and a rebuilt 1-kilometre spur line off the existing Outer Harbor rail line. The new station would have been constructed next to Baker Street in Port Adelaide, using the existing corridor adjacent the National Railway Museum that connects it to the Outer Harbor railway line. However, it was announced in June 2019 that development has been \\"halted\\" indefinitely; the preparations for the failed project was reversed in January 2020.

It has won various national awards.  About the park  It is situated about a mile outside the city centre on Manningham Lane, the main road between Bradford and Shipley. It is one of the city's largest parks and was purchased by the City of Bradford for half its commercial value from Samuel Cunliffe Lister, who built Lister's Mill. An open air swimming pool, the Lister Park Lido was added to the park in 1915. Although it was very popular in its early years, by the 1930s the public were losing interest in the facility which no longer met the standards of hygiene they expected. In response to proposals made by the baths committee, the council carried out a modernisation scheme in 1937 which involved the installation of a filtration, sterilisation and heating plant. A cafe was also added. The Lido was reopened in May 1939. Popularity of the Lido waned over time and by 1982 repairs to the value of ¬£60,000 were needed. The Lido closed in 1983 and was demolished in 1991. The park has been successfully renovated in recent years. The lake has been re- opened for boats and a Mughal Water Garden constructed. There are also tennis and basketball courts, bowling greens and a children's playground. Lister Park contains the Cartwright Hall art gallery, where permanent and temporary exhibitions of modern and traditional art can be seen.

It is believed to originate in the early 19th century or before, during a period when ships' crews, especially those of military vessels, were large enough to permit hauling a rope whilst simply marching along the deck. With the advent of merchant packet and clipper ships and their smaller crews, which required different working methods, use of the shanty appears to have declined or shifted to other, minor tasks. \\"Drunken Sailor\\" was revived as a popular song among non-sailors in the 20th century, and grew to become one of the best- known songs of the shanty repertoire among mainstream audiences. It has been performed and recorded by many musical artists and appeared in many popular media. Although the song's lyrics vary, they usually contain some variant of the question, \\"What shall we do with a drunken sailor, early in the morning?\\" In some styles of performance, each successive verse suggests a method of sobering or punishing the drunken sailor. In other styles, further questions are asked and answered about different people. The song shares its tune with the traditional Irish folk song \\"√ìr√≥ s√© do bheatha abhaile\\" (Irish pronunciation: , English: \\"Oh-ro welcome home\\"), possibly a Jacobite song, as the traditional version mentions \\"S√©arlas √ìg\\" (\\"Young Charles\\" in Irish), referring to Bonnie Prince Charlie and dating the song to the third Jacobite rising of 1745‚Äì6. p. 303 87. √ìr√≥, ‚Äôs√© do ·∏Éea·π´a a·∏Éaile (See page 151.) \\"This little Jacobite relic I got from Nancy Tracey, Co. Tyrone, and also from C√°it N√≠ ƒäeallaƒã√°in, an old woman 90 years of age in Ballor, Fanad, Co. Donegal. It has a catchy, popular air. A refrain somewhat similar to this one was common in Farney, but the song to which it belonged was lost before my time. \\"H√≥, r√≥, r√≥, ‚Äôs√© do ·∏Éea·π´a un a‚Äô ·∏Éaile, H√≥, r√≥, r√≥, √≥s cionn duine eile ; H√≥, r√≥, r√≥, ‚Äôs√© do ·∏Éea·π´a un a‚Äô ·∏Éaile, T√° t√∫ amuiƒ° le r√°i·π´ƒãe.\\" The tune appears as number 1425 in George Petrie's The Complete Collection of Irish Music (1855) under the title √ì ro! ‚Äôs√© do ·∏Éea·π´a a ·∏Éaile (modern script: √ì ro! ‚Äôs√© do bheatha a bhaile) and is marked ‚ÄúAncient clan march.‚Äù It can also be found at number 983 (also marked ‚ÄúAncient Clan March‚Äù) and as a fragment at number 1056, titled Welcome home Prince Charley. p. 251, No. 983 Ancient Clan March, p. 268, No. 1056 Welcome home Prince Charley, p. 356, No. 1425 √ì ro! ‚Äôs√© do ·∏Éea·π´a a ·∏Éaile. \\"√ìr√≥ s√© do bheatha abhaile\\" was often sung by the Irish Volunteers during the Easter Rising, but with different, non-sectarian lyrics composed by P√°draig Pearse. The song is No. 322 in the Roud Folk Song Index. Origins Melody and first verse of \\"Drunken Sailor\\", culled from R. R. Terry's The Shanty Book, Part One (1921). The air of the song, in the Dorian mode and in duple march rhythm, has been compared to the style of a bagpipe melody.Sharp, Cecil. 1914. English Folk- Chanteys. Pg. 66. The authorship and origin of \\"Drunken Sailor\\" are unknown. History =As a shanty= The first published description of the shanty is found in an account of an 1839 whaling voyage out of New London, Connecticut to the Pacific Ocean.Hugill, Stan. 1961. Shanties from the Seven Seas. London. It was used as an example of a song that was \\"performed with very good effect when there is a long line of men hauling together\\". The tune was noted, along with these lyrics: Although this is the earliest discovered published mention, there is some indication that the shanty is at least as old as the 1820s. In Eckstorm and Smyth's collection Minstrelsy of Maine (published 1927), the editors note that one of their grandmothers, who sang the song, claimed to have heard it used during the task of tacking on the Penobscot River \\"probably [by the time of the editor's reportage] considerably over a hundred years ago\\".Eckstorm, Fannie Hardy and Mary Winslow Smyth. 1927. Minstrelsy of Maine: Folk-songs and Ballads of the Woods and the Coast. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin. Despite these indications of the song's existence in the first half of the 19th century, references to it are rare. They include a reference in a work of fiction from 1855 in which a drunken female cook is portrayed singing, A five-verse set of lyrics and tune were published in the third edition of Davis and Tozer's shanty collection, Sailor Songs or 'Chanties.Davis, J. and Ferris Tozer. 1891. Sailor Songs or 'Chanties. Third edition (enlarged). Boosey & Co. However, the title did not appear in any of the other major shanty collections or articles of the 19th century. When John Masefield next published the lyrics in 1906, he called it a \\"bastard variety\\" of shanty which was \\"seldom used\\"Masefield, John. 1906. A Sailor's Garland. Methuen & Co.‚Äîan assertion supported by the lack of many earlier references. This style of shanty, called a \\"runaway chorus\\" by Masefield, and as a \\"stamp and go\\" or \\"walk away\\" shanty by others, was said to be used for tacking and which was sung in \\"quick time\\". The verses in Masefield's version asked what to do with a \\"drunken sailor\\", followed by a response, then followed by a question about a \\"drunken soldier\\", with an appropriate response. Capt. W. B. Whall, a veteran English sailor of the 1860s‚Äì70s, was the next author to publish on \\"Drunken Sailor\\". He claimed that this was one of only two shanties that was sung in the British Royal Navy (where singing at work was generally frowned upon). Moreover, the song had largely gone out of use as a \\"walk away\\" shanty when the size of ships' crews was reduced and it was no longer possible to use that working method.Whall, Captain W. B. 1910. Sea Songs and Shanties. Brown, Son and Ferguson. The lyrics given by Whall are essentially the same as those from Masefield: about a \\"drunken sailor\\", then a \\"drunken soldier\\". Significantly, he stated that these were the only lyrics, as evidently the task did not take long to complete. The above-mentioned and other veteran sailorse.g. Williams, James H. \\"The Sailors' 'Chanties. The Independent (8 July 1909):76‚Äì83. characterized \\"Drunken Sailor\\" as a \\"walk away\\" shanty, thus providing a possible explanation for why it was not noted more often in the second half of the 19th century. Later sailors' recollections, however, attested that the song continued to be used as a shanty, but for other purposes. Richard Maitland, an American sailor of the 1870s, sang it for song collector Alan Lomax in 1939, when he explained, > Now this is a song that's usually sang when men are walking away with the > slack of a rope, generally when the iron ships are scrubbing their bottom. > After an iron ship has been twelve months at sea, there's a quite a lot of > barnacles and grass grows onto her bottom. And generally, in the calm > latitudes, up in the horse latitudes in the North Atlantic Ocean, usually > they rig up a purchase for to scrub the bottom.Various Artists. 2004. > American Sea Songs & Shanties. Duncan Emrich, ed. The Library of Congress, > Archive of Folk Culture. Rounder, CD, 18964-1519-2. Another American sailor of the 1870s, Frederick Pease Harlow, wrote in his shanty collection that \\"Drunken Sailor\\" could be used when hauling a halyard in \\"hand over hand\\" fashion to hoist the lighter sails.Harlow, Frederick Pease. 1962. Chanteying Aboard American Ships. Barre, Mass.: Barre Publishing Co. This would be in contradistinction to the much more typical \\"halyards shanties\\", which were for heavier work with an entirely different sort of pacing and formal structure. Another author to ascribe a function, Richard Runciman Terry, also said it could be used for \\"hand over hand\\" hauling. Terry was one of few writers, however, to also state the shanty was used for heaving the windlass or capstan.Terry, Richard Runciman. 1921. The Shanty Book, Part I. London: J. Curwen & Sons. =As a popular song= \\"Drunken Sailor\\" began its life as a popular song on land at least as early as the 1900s, by which time it had been adopted as repertoire for glee singing at Eton College.Malden, Charles Herbert. 1905. Recollections of an Eton Colleger: 1898‚Äì1902. Eton College: Spotswood and Co. p. 73\\"Truthful James\\". 1902. \\"Camp. A Prospect\\". Eton College Chronicle 977 (29 July 1902): 137. Elsewhere in England, by the 1910s, men had begun to sing it regularly at gatherings of the Savage Club of London.Bullen, Frank. T. and W. F. Arnold. 1914. Songs of Sea Labour. London: Orpheus Music Publishing. In 1906, Percy Grainger recorded Charles Rosher of London, England, singing \\"What shall we do with a drunken sailor\\", and the recording is available online via the British Library Sound Archive. \\"Drunken Sailor Medley\\" by John Baltzell The song became popular on land in America as well. A catalogue of \\"folk-songs\\" from the Midwest included it in 1915, where it was said to be sung while dancing \\"a sort of reel\\".Pound, Louise. 1915. \\"Folk-song of Nebraska and the Central West: A Syllabus\\". Nebraska Academy of Sciences Publications 9(3). p. l152. More evidence of lands-folk's increasing familiarity with \\"Drunken Sailor\\" comes in the recording of a \\"Drunken Sailor Medley\\" (c. 1923) by U.S. Old Time fiddler John Baltzell. Evidently the tune's shared affinities with Anglo-Irish-American dance tunes helped it to become readapted as such, as Baltzell included it among a set of reels. Classical composers utilized the song in compositions. Australian composer Percy Grainger incorporated the song into his piece \\"Scotch Strathspey And Reel\\" (1924). Malcolm Arnold used its melody in his Three Shanties for Woodwind Quintet, Op. 4 (1943). The glut of writings on sailors' songs and published collections that came starting in the 1920s supported a revival of interest in shanty-singing for entertainment purposes on land. As such, R. R. Terry's very popular shanty collection, which had begun to serve as a resource for renditions of shanties on commercial recordings in the 1920s, was evidently used by the Robert Shaw Chorale for their 1961 rendition.Robert Shaw Chorale. 1961. Sea Shanties. Living Stereo. LP. The Norman Luboff Choir recorded the song in 1959 with the uncharacteristic phrasing, \\"What'll we do...?\\"Norman Luboff Choir, The. 1959. Songs of the British Isles. Columbia. LP. The song's accordion version is used in the Nickelodeon TV series, SpongeBob SquarePants, often in scenes involving the Krusty Krab. Notable recordings and performances The song has been widely recorded under a number of titles by a range of performers including being a background song on Nickelodeon TV series Black Lagoon, King's Singers, Pete Seeger, The Blaggards, U.K. Subs, and most notably The Irish Rovers. It also forms part of a contrapuntal section in the BBC Radio 4 UK Theme by Fritz Spiegl, in which it is played alongside Greensleeves. An also notable cover was performed in 1966 by the Belgian skiffle-singer Ferre Grignard. For over 50 years The Irish Rovers have played the song as their usual show-closer. Several of their recordings of the song, sometimes under the name \\"Weigh Hey and up She Rises\\" have \\"gone viral\\" on YouTube.Belfast News Letter, Feb. 2012 \\"Irish Rovers Return with Titanic Tribute\\" ‚Äì http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/regional/irish-rovers-return-with-titanic- tribute-1-3557071 As a response, the band released the 2012 album, \\"Drunken Sailor\\" including the title track and a prequel that tells the earlier life of the 'Drunken Sailor', called \\"Whores and Hounds\\".Belfast Telegraph, Feb. 2012 \\"Video: Irish Rovers release Titanic tribute song\\" ‚Äì http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/news/video-irish-rovers- release-titanic-tribute-song-28719763.html Don Janse produced an arrangement in the early 1960s which has been included in several choral music anthologies. The arrangement was first recorded by The Idlers, and has been performed by several collegiate groups over the years, including the Yale Alley Cats. Pere Ubu's 1978 song \\"Caligari's Mirror\\" is a post-punk reworking of \\"Drunken Sailor.\\" On the television series Seaquest DSV, the shanty is sung by Chief Manilow Crocker (Royce D. Applegate) and crew as they begin repairs on a submarine during the Season 1 Episode \\"Bad Water\\" aired 7 November 1993. LeperKhanz recorded a version of the song on the album Tiocfaidh √År L√° (2005). The melody was also utilized by NFL Films composer Sam Spence for his track \\"Up as She Rises.\\"MarketWatch, 28 January 2015 \\"The 11 best over the top tunes from NFL films\\" ‚Äì https://nypost.com/2015/01/28/the-11-best-over-the-top- tunes-from-nfl-films/ A version of the song appears in the 2012 stealth video-game Dishonored. This version is called \\"The Drunken Whaler\\" however, tying into the video game's fictional world; where whaling is a prominent and important industry. The verses in this version all result in the subject whaler's death, such as \\"feed him to the hungry rats for dinner\\" (a reference to the rat plague that was a major plot point in the title). Another version of the song by Sean Dagher, Michiel Schrey, and Nils Brown appears in the 2013 action-adventure video game Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. The British group Lord Rockingham's XI used the tune as the basis for their instrumental \\"Long John\\". The Russian band \\"Aquarium\\" has a song called \\"What should we do with a drunken sailor?\\". In Ringo Starr's famous rendition of You're Sixteen, Starr is heard singing the chorus of the song in the fade at the end.https://genius.com/Ringo-starr-youre-sixteen-youre-beautiful-youre-mine- lyricshttps://www.lyricsondemand.com/r/ringostarrlyrics/youresixteenyourebeautifulyoureminelyrics.html Song text =Pronunciation of \\"early\\"= The word \\"early\\" is often pronounced as in modern performances. Publications in the 19th and early 20th century, however, did not note this was the case. Neither the field recordings of Richard Maitland by Alan Lomax (1939) nor those of several veteran sailors in Britain by James Madison Carpenter in the 1920s use this pronunciation. However, opera singer Leonard Warren recorded the song in July 1947 and pronounced . Later, on his popular recording of 1956, Burl Ives also pronounced . Subsequently, Stan Hugill, whose influential Shanties from the Seven Seas was published in 1961, stated in that work that the word was always pronounced .

Despite this improvement, the literacy rate among the tribes is much below in comparison to that of all STs at the national level (47.1 percent). Like the overall literacy rate among the STs, male and female literacy rates (54 percent and 27.2 percent) are also considerably lower than those at the national level (59.2 percent and 34.8 percent). Among the numerically larger tribes, Oraon and Kharia have more than half of the population in the age of seven (7) years and above are literates while Munda have the literacy rate almost equal to that of all STs at the national level. Remaining five larger tribal groups have shown the overall literacy rates lower than that of the national average. Among the total tribal literates, 33.6 percent are either without any educational level or have attained education below primary level. The proportions of literates who have attained education up to primary level and middle level are 28.6 percent and 17.7 percent respectively. Persons educated up to matric / secondary / higher secondary constitute 16.5 percent. This implies that every 6th tribal literate is matriculate. Graduates and above are 3.5 percent while non-technical and technical diploma holders constitute a negligible 0.1 percent only. While Kharia, Oraon, and Ho have the highest proportion of matriculates, i.e., every 5th literates of these tribes are matriculates closely followed by Munda who have every 6th literate a matriculate. Kharwar have the lowest percentage of matriculates, preceded by Bhumij, Lohra, and Santhal. While Oraon and Kharia have the highest percentage of graduates, Bhumij have the lowest proportion of degree holders, preceded by Kharwar, Lohra, and Santhal. The data show that the proportion of tribal literates decline sharply in higher level of education as the percentage of students after matriculation drops down to almost one third in higher secondary level. Out of the total 19.8 lakh tribal children in the age group 5‚Äì14 years, only 8.5 lakh children have been attending school constituting 43.1 percent. Alarmingly, as many as 11.3 lakh (56.9 percent) children in the corresponding age group have not been going to school. The Statement below shows that among the major STs, Oraon, Kharia and Munda have more than 50 percent school going children whereas Santhal, Ho, Lohra have 36‚Äì47 percent children attending school.http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_jharkhand.pdf Tribal festivals in Jharkhand =Sarhul= People worshiping under holy sarna tree on the occasion of sarhul in outskirts of Ranchi, Jharkhand. Sarhul is spring festival celebrated during spring season when the Saal trees get new flowers on their branches. It is a worship of the village deity who is considered to be the protector of the tribes. People sing and dance a lot when the new flowers appear. The deities are worshiped with saal flowers. The village priest or Pahan fasts for a couple of days. In the early morning he takes a bath and puts on new a dhoti made of virgin cotton (kachha dhaga). The previous evening, the Pahan takes three new earthen pots and fills them with fresh water; the next morning he observes these earthen pots and water level inside. If the water level decreases he predicts that there would be famine or less rain, and if the water level is normal, that is the signal of a good rain. Before pooja starts, the wife of the Pahan washes his feet and gets blessings from him. At the pooja, Pahan offers three young roosters of different colors to one for the almighty god -- the Singbonga or Dharmesh, as the Mundas, Ho and Oraons respectively address Him; another for the village deities; and the third for the ancestors. During this pooja villagers surround the Sarna place. Traditional drum ‚Äî Dhol, Nagara and Turhi ‚Äî players keep drumming and playing along with Pahan chanting prayers to deities. When pooja is finished, boys carry Pahan on their shoulders and girls dancing ahead take him to his house where his wife welcomes him by washing his feet. Then Pahan offers Saal flowers to his wife and villagers. These flowers represent the brotherhood and friendship among villagers and Pahan the priest, distributes saal flowers to every villager. He also puts saals flowers on every house's roof which is called \\"phool khonsi\\". At the same time Prasad, a rice made beer called Handia, is distributed among the villagers. And the whole village celebrates with singing and dancing this festival of Sarhul. It goes on for weeks in this region of Chhotanagpur. In Kolhan region it is called \\"Baa Porob\\" meaning Flower Festival. It is the festival of the great happiness. =Mage Porob= Mage Porob is the principal festival celebrated among the Ho people of eastern India, and is also celebrated by the Munda people, though followers of Birsa Dharam, a new religion based on traditional Munda spirituality and religion, do not celebrate Mage Porob, despite the fact that they celebrate other traditional Munda festivals. It is also not celebrated by any other Munda-speaking peoples, and is much less prominent to the Mundas than to the Hos. It is held in the month of Magha in honor of the deity Singbonga who, in the Ho creation myth, created Luku Kola, the first man on Earth. It was first described in 1912 by Indian anthropologist Rai Bahadur Sarat Chandra Roy in his The Mundas and their Country. =Hal Punhya= Hal punhya is a festival which begins with the fall of winter. The first day of Magh month, known as \\"Akhain Jatra\\" or \\"Hal Punhya\\", considered as the beginning of ploughing. The farmers, to symbolize this auspicious morning plough two and half circles of their agricultural land this day is also considered as the symbol of good fortune. Tribal artwork *Chhou mask - Chhou is a type of dance done with colourful masks. The masks are made of papier-m√¢ch√© in Singhbhum and the purulia district of Jharkhand and west Bengal respectively. Papier-m√¢ch√© of Saraikela and Charinda are famous for Chhou dance. Sometimes it appears similar to the masks used in kerla in Kathakali. File:Chhou Mask.jpgChhou mask which is used in Chhou dance of Singhbhum district of Jharkhand *Tribal woodwork - Jharkhand is full of good quality saal forest and hence wooden artwork in the \\"should\\" of tribals. The wood is used for cooking, housing, farming, fishing etc. The tribal artists of some villages have explored their creativity in art, like beautifully decorative door panels, toys, boxes, and other household articles. *Tribal Painting - The painting is mainly a source of livelihood for hyhyh tribe in Jharkhand and practiced in the region of Santhal Pragana and nearby areas. *Tribal Bamboo Artwork - The bamboo found in this area are different from bamboo of Southeast Asia. There is tourist place, Netarhat, which means a Bazaar of Bamboo. These bamboos are thin, and strong and flexible. The tribal people use bamboo for making baskets, hunting & fishing equipments. Specially the bamboo made fishing cage is very attractive. *Godna - Tribals use ornaments a lots but the spiritual concept of ornament is very different. They believe that all ornaments are human made and are mortal. Therefore, they invented tattoos as permanent ornament. Majority of tribal woman have tattoos called Godna, on their bodies. However, tribal man also use Godna. They believe that Godna are the only ornament which goes with them after death also. *Tribal weapons - Bow and arrow is the symbolic weapon of the tribals of this area. Apart from this they use iron made Axes and Doulies and Ghana (Big hammer). Tribal religion  =Sarna= Although, Hinduism is the predominant religion of the State (68.6 percent), the Hindu tribes constitute 39.8 percent only. As many as 45.1 percent of the tribal population follow ‚Äòother religions and persuations‚Äô. Christian tribes are 14.5 percent and less than half percent (0.4 percent) are Muslims. Among the major tribes, more than half of the total population (56.6 percent) of nature worshipping Santals are 'Bedins' who also worship bongas. Oraon and Munda have more than 50 percent of population follow ‚Äòother religions and persuasions‚Äô followed by Christianity. Ho tribe has the highest proportion (91 percent) of persons professing ‚Äòother religions and persuations‚Äô.*http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_jharkhand.pdf Sarna religion/Sarna Dharam (regarded by tribals as Sari Dharam, that means True Religion) is religion of tribals of India. They have their own worship place called \\"SARNA ASTHAL/JAHER\\". They have also religious flag called \\"SARNA JHANDA\\". Which can be seen more in Ranchi District. In Ranchi the capital of jharkhand, there are \\"SARNA ASTHAL\\". In SARHUL festival every Oraon gather in Ranchi with a great Rally. In this time \\"SARNA JHANDA\\" can be seen every where in Ranchi. Some tribe followed Sarna Dharam, where Sarna means sacred grove. Their religion is based on the oral traditions passed from generation-to- generation. The religion is deeply ingrained in their culture and traditions, respecting the superiority of our natural world and its power. It strongly believes in one God, the Supreme Being, the Great Spirit, the Great One, the Creator, the Mighty Spirit, the one who rules over the entire universe, known as Dharmesh. They strongly believe in Lord Dharmesh's appearance in Sal trees. Sarna People in Ranchi (Jharkhand) in their traditional attire According to their philosophy, the lord Dharmesh is the most powerful and most important deity. He is responsible for the creation of our universe including our ancestors besides acting as our protector. In fact, the whole world (Universe) is regulated by a superpower that is Dharmesh in Kurukh which simply means the almighty, he is also called Mahaedeo. The great one Dharmesh's purity demands that he be offered sacrifices only of things that are white. Hence he is given sacrifices of white goats, white fowls, white gulainchi flowers, white cloth, sugar, milk, etc. White is the sacred colour of Oraon tribe, in fact it is true for most adivasi. Among the many important deities, the Chala-pacho Devi (Sarna Devi) is among the most important and most respected deity. The Gram Devi Chala-Pachho is a caring Old age lady with beautifully flowing white hair. It is believed that the Sal tree is the holy abode of the Sarna Devi, the mother goddess that protects and nurtures the Oraon tribe and others. On the occasion of Sarhul festival, the Pahan conducts special puja of the Devi. According to Sarna Dharam, the Devi lives in the wooden soop of Pahan kept at Chala-Kutti place, the auspicious place at Pahan's home. At Kutti place, one stick made up of Saal wood or Bamboo Wood is fixed on the ground, on this respected wooden soop called Sarna-Soop, the Sarna-Devi resides. Tribals perform rituals under the Sal trees at a place called ‚ÄòSarna Sthal‚Äô, it is also known as ‚ÄòJaher‚Äô (sacred grove); it resembles a small forest patch. In Oraons‚Äô villages, one can easily find the sacred religious place the ‚ÄòSarna Sthal‚Äô that has holy Sal trees and other trees planted at the site. Sometimes the Jaher are located inside the nearby forest area and not in the village. This Sarna Sthal (Jaher) is a common religious place for the whole village and almost all the important socio-religious ceremonies of the village take place at this place only. These ceremonies are performed by the whole village community at a public gathering with the active participation of village priests known as ‚ÄòPahan‚Äô. The chief assistant of village priest is called ‚ÄòPujaar‚Äô or ‚ÄòPanbhara‚Äô. ---- The tribals have their own way of conscience, faith and belief. Basically, they believe in the super natural spirit called the Singbonga. According to the belief of the Santhal community, the world is inhabited by spiritual beings of different kinds; and the Santhals consider themselves as living and doing everything in close association with these supernatural beings. They perform rituals under the Sal trees at a place called \\"Jaher\\" (sacred grove). Often the Jaher can be found in the forests. They believe in Bonga's appearance in Sal trees and have named their religion \\"Sarna.\\" The genesis of the Sarna religion is interesting. According to the mythology of the Santhal community, the Santhal tribals had gone to the forest for hunting and they started the discussion about their ‚ÄòCreator and Savior‚Äô while they were resting under a tree. They questioned themselves that who is their God? Whether the Sun, the Wind or the Cloud? Finally, they came to a conclusion that they would leave an arrow in the sky and wherever the arrow would target that will be the God's house. They left an arrow in the sky; it fell down under a Sal tree. They started worshiping the tree and named their religion as \\"Sarna\\" because it is derived from a Sal tree. Thus, Sarna religion came into existence. There are priests and an assistant priests called \\"Naikey\\" and \\"Kudam Naike\\" in every Santhal village. =Sarna Union= All India Sarna Dhorom, at Jhoradi Odisha in the district of Mayurbhanj. It was from this union that as many procession, demonstration with their drums and equipment like TUMDH, TAMAK, GHURI, CHORCHURI, AAH, SAR, KHANDA, TARWALE etc. held in the various part of the country like Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and in many other places, their aims and objective was to raise the audible voice in ears of State and Central Government so that they are being protected from extinct and their laws and religious are being valued by Government and people of India as other religious. It has its Law and order made by its cabinet committee and it is being followed by all Sarnaism . They too organize seminars, conferences to enhance their Laws and Order among all Sarnaism. There are many charitable trust to provide free medical treatment among the poor people, they too, run many schools and colleges in the mentioned state of India.

A 1928 description of the drink was: gin, and a spot of lime.D. B. Wesson, I'll Never Be Cured III The description in the 1953 Raymond Chandler novel The Long Goodbye stated that \\"a real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's lime juice and nothing else.\\"Terry Lennox in Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye This is in line with the proportions suggested by The Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), which specifies one half Plymouth Gin and one half Rose's Lime Juice Cordial. However, modern tastes are less sweet, and generally provide for at least two parts gin to one part of the lime and other non-alcoholic elements (see recipes below). The derivation of the name of the cocktail is contested. It may be named after the tool for drilling small holes (alluding to its 'piercing' effect on the drinker) or after Surgeon Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette KCB (1857‚Äì1943), who is said to have first added lime cordial to the daily gin tot of the men of the Royal Navy to help combat the ravages of scurvy on long voyages.Covey Crump, a 1955 dictionary of Royal Navy slang by Commander A. Covey-Crump, RN, a former Naval Assistant to the Chief of Naval Information. Variations A variant of the cocktail, the vodka gimlet, replaces gin with vodka. A similar lime juice cocktail using rum instead of vodka or gin is the daiquiri. Preparation David A. Embury gave a gimlet recipe (called a Gin Sour) in The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks (3rd Ed., 1958), calling for an 8:2:1 gin/lime (or lemon) juice/simple syrup ratio plus garnish. Eric Felten essentially repeated this in his \\"How's Your Drink\\" column in The Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition of August 4, 2006: * gin or vodka * lime juice * simple syrup * Garnish with a lime William L. Hamilton gave this recipe in his \\"Shaken and Stirred\\" column in The New York Times on September 15, 2002: A gimlet served at the Fifty Seven Fifty Seven Bar at the Four Seasons Hotel consists of the following, shaken with ice: * vodka * fresh lime juice * Rose's lime juice * lime wedge for garnish The Bartender's Bible by Gary Regan lists the recipe as: * Plymouth Gin * Rose's lime juice * Garnish with lime wedge Regan also states \\"since the Rose's product has such a long and impressive history (which predates the gimlet), I am inclined to think that Rose's was the ingredient that invented the drink.\\" The New New York Bartender's Guide by Sally Ann Berk lists the ratio of gin to Rose's lime juice as 3:1. The recipe on Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice label: * Rose's Lime Juice * vodka, rum, or gin * Shake with ice and serve Charles H. Baker quoted a recipe in The Gentleman's Companion - an Exotic Drinking Book (1939) of: * 45 mL (1 jigger) dry gin * 5 mL (1 tsp) simple syrup * 2.5 mL ( tsp) Lime Cordial Take a big saucer champagne glass, put in 45 mL (1 jigger) either of dry or old Tom gin, 5 mL (1 tsp) gomme syrup or sugar, 2.5 mL ( tsp) ‚Äì to taste ‚Äì of lime syrup or lime cordial. Fill up with chilled plain water, add 1 ice cube and thin slice of big green lime. Don't use soda water, please. He is also quoted from the book as saying: :\\"Why on earth this stroke of genius stands unheralded and unsung in this fair and allegedly free land of ours shall, to us, always be a mystery like who it is that designs expensive radio cabinets, why all cinema stars long to ruin themselves playing highbrow roles, and why good prize fighters want to write fiction. Throughout the whole swing of the Far East, starting with Bombay-down the Malabar Coast to Colombo; to Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, the Gimlet is just as well known as our Martini here. :And from Bombay-down the Malabar Coast to Colombo; to Penang, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, gin was a form of a healing tonic for malaria! Limes healed scurvy creating the perfect medicinal cocktail.: :The main thing in its flavour is that, unlike most cocktails, it is not \\"warming\\" in hot weather, and in fact is a good cooler. It is simple, without fancy fizzings, and is one to experiment with until the precise amount of lime cordial is found, to taste. . . . This last is a British invention based on a similar essence to Rose's Lime Juice-which comes in the slender decorative bottle we see back of most good soda fountains-but is not quite so pungent. Soda fountain lime syrup also would do in a pinch. We have approximated it with fine results by diluting it with equal amounts of water.\\" The following vodka gimlet recipe is from the novels of Stuart Woods: > Pour six ounces [180 mL] of vodka from a 750 mL bottle; replace with six > ounces [180 mL] Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice (available from nearly any > grocery), add a small amount of water for ice crystals, shake twice and > store in the freezer overnight. Pour into a martini glass and serve straight > up. The glass will immediately frost over. With this recipe, no cocktail > shaker is required and the cocktail is not watered down by melting ice. You > may use even the cheapest vodka, and no one will ever know. A variation that adds mint is commonly known as a South Side. The Carnaby Gimlet, a variation with natural spring water, was created at the Carnaby Club, Rimini, Italy. The recipe is: * gin (suggested with Tanqueray or Bombay Sapphire) * fresh lime juice * Sweet Lime Syrup * top with cold still water * Serve with ice and lime slice in old fashioned double shot tumbler Etymology The word \\"gimlet\\" used in this sense is first attested in 1928. The most obvious derivation is from the tool for drilling small holes, a word also used figuratively to describe something as sharp or piercing. Thus, the cocktail may have been named for its \\"penetrating\\" effects on the drinker. Another theory is that the drink was named after British Royal Navy Surgeon Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette KCB (1857-1943), who allegedly introduced this drink as a means of inducing his messmates to take lime juice as an anti- scurvy medication.Covey Crump, a 1955 dictionary of Royal Navy slang by Commander A. Covey-Crump, RN, a former Naval Assistant to the Chief of Naval Information. However, neither his obituary notice in the BMJ, The Times (6 October 1943) nor his entry in Who Was Who 1941‚Äì1950 mention this association.

She was the first woman to earn through her writing. Wilson was a native of Columbus, Georgia, and her first book, Inez, a Tale of the Alamo, was written when she was still young. It was published by Harpers, but met with indifferent success. Her second book, Beulah, was issued in 1859 and became at once popular, still selling well when the American Civil War broke out. Cut off from the world of publishers, and intensely concerned for the cause of secession, she wrote nothing more until several years later when she published her third story, Macaria, dedicated to the soldiers of the Southern Army. This book was burned by some protesters. After the war closed, Wilson travelled to New York with the copy of St. Elmo, which was speedily published and met with great success. Her later works, Vashti; Infelice; and At the Mercy of Tiberius had phenomenal success. In 1868, she married Lorenzo Madison Wilson, of Alabama, and they resided at Spring Hill. Early years Augusta Jane Evans was born on May 8, 1835, in Columbus, Georgia, the eldest child of the family. The area of her birth was then known as Wynnton (now MidTown). Her mother was Sarah S. Howard and her father was Matthew R. Evans. She was a descendant on her mother's side from the Howards, one of the most cultured families of Georgia. As a young girl in 19th-century America, she received little in the way of a formal education. However, she became a voracious reader at an early age. Her father suffered bankruptcy and lost the family's Sherwood Hall property in the 1840s. He moved his family of ten from Georgia to Alabama, and Augusta was scarcely ten when they moved to San Antonio, Texas, in 1845. When the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War had ended, and everything was in a disorganized condition, there were no schools of any prominence. Had her mother not been cultivated and literary, Evans could never have obtained the education which prepared her for the work she later accomplished. During the Mexican war, San Antonio was the rendezvous for the United States troops sent to assist General Zachary Taylor, and the brilliant uniforms of the soldiery, the martial music, and the exciting events that accompany war, combined with the picturesque, enchanting scenery around San Antonio, furnished an excellent theme for Evans' first novel. In 1850, at the age of fifteen, she wrote Inez: A Tale of the Alamo, a sentimental, moralistic, anti-Catholic love story. It told the story of one orphan's spiritual journey from religious skepticism to devout faith. She presented the manuscript to her father as a Christmas gift in 1854. It was published anonymously in 1855. However, life in a frontier border town like San Antonio proved dangerous, especially with the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. By 1849, Evans' parents moved the family to Mobile, Alabama. She wrote her next novel, Beulah, at age 18; it was published in 1859. Beulah began the theme of female education in her novels. It sold well, selling over 22,000 copies during its first year of publication, a staggering accomplishment. It established her as Alabama's first professional author. Her family used the proceeds from her literary success to purchase Georgia Cottage on Springhill Avenue. Career =Civil War= After most of the Southern states declared their independence and seceded from the Union into the Confederate States of America, Evans became a staunch Southern patriot. Her brothers had joined the 3rd Alabama Regiment and, when she traveled to visit them in Virginia, her party was fired upon by Union soldiers from Fort Monroe. \\"O! I longed for a Secession flag to shake defiantly in their teeth at every fire! And my fingers fairly itched to touch off a red-hot-ball in answer to their chivalric civilities\\", she wrote to a friend. She became active in the subsequent Civil War as a propagandist. Evans was engaged to a New York journalist named James Reed Spalding. But she broke off the engagement in 1860, because he supported Abraham Lincoln. She nursed sick and wounded Confederate soldiers at Fort Morgan on Mobile Bay. Evans also visited Confederate soldiers at Chickamauga. She sewed sandbags for the defense of the community, wrote patriotic addresses, and set up a hospital near her residence. The hospital was dubbed Camp Beulah by local admirers in honor of her novel. She also corresponded with General P.G.T. de Beauregard in 1862. Evans wrote Macaria and St. Elmo at Georgia Cottage. The Civil War cut Evans off from her publishers, so it was many years before she ventured on her third novel Macaria, a propaganda masterpiece and a novel she later claimed was written by candlelight while nursing wounded Confederates. The novel is about Southern women making the ultimate sacrifice for the Confederacy; it promoted national desire for an independent national culture and reflected Southern values as they were at that time. She sent a copy of this book with a letter to the publishers through the blockade. It was carried safely to Havana, and thence to New York City. The book had already been published by a bookseller in Richmond, Virginia, and printed in South Carolina on coarse Confederate paper. It was entered according to the Confederate States of America, and dedicated to the brave soldiers of the Southern army. Some portions of the manuscript were scribbled in pencil while sitting up with the sick soldiers in \\"Camp Beulah\\" near Mobile. A Federal officer in Kentucky seized and burned every copy of the Confederate edition of Macaria which he could lay his hands upon. In some way, a Northern publisher obtained a copy, published it but swore he would pay no royalty to so \\"arch a rebel.\\" J. B. Lippincott & J.C. Derby expostulated with him, and finally secured a contract by which the author would receive a set amount on every copy sold. General George Henry Thomas, commander of the Union Army in Tennessee, confiscated copies and had the books burned. =Post-war years= A a frame from the lost film St. Elmo (1914), based on the novel by Augusta Evans. After the Civil War ended, Evans went to New York to take the manuscript of her most ambitious effort, St. Elmo (1866). She finished the celebrated novel at the home of her aunt, Mary Howard Jones (wife of Colonel Seaborn Jones), \\"El Dorado\\". In St. Elmo the general setting, if not the specific details, seems to be the Jones's El Dorado. In 1878, the home was purchased by Captain and Mrs. James J. Slade who changed its name to St. Elmo in honor of the novel which it had inspired.National Register of Historic Places, http://www.nps.gov/nr/ St. Elmo sold a million copies within four months. It featured sexual tension between the protagonist St. Elmo, who was cynical, and the heroine Edna Earl, who was beautiful and devout. It became one of the most popular novels of the 19th century. Towns, hotels, steamboats and plantations were named after it, and the author was recompensed with large financial returns. The \\"high flown\\" language in which it was written, and the rare literary attainments of the little barefoot heroine drew forth severe criticism, and some one even ventured on a parody, \\"St. Twelvemo\\"; but all this could not affect the popularity of the book. People were eager for her next work, and after Vashti appeared, could not rest satisfied until they heard that another would soon be given them. Soon after Vashti was published, in 1868, she married Confederate veteran Colonel Lorenzo Madison Wilson, becoming Augusta Evans Wilson. He was 27 years her senior. Colonel Wilson acquired wealth in banking, railroads, and wholesale groceries. Not far from her home at Georgia Cottage, they settled in a columned house called Ashland in Mobile. The couple attended St. Francis Street Methodist Church. Wilson became the first lady of Mobile society, supplanting Madame Le Vert who had fallen into social disfavor for having welcomed the Federal occupation of Mobile too warmly. Because of her delicate health, Lorenzo objected seriously to her writing, and at his request, she discontinued it and devoted herself to decorating her home and grounds. Colonel Wilson died in 1892. Time and time again flattering offers came for her to contribute to magazines and papers, but she refused. Not even a proposition to let her name her own price for a serial could tempt her. One publisher offered if she would only allow them to publish her books in cheap \\"paperback\\" form, not to interfere with her library-bound editions, but this permission was never granted. She received a check for for Vashti before it ever went to press. Ten years elapsed between Infelice and At the Mercy of Tiberius. Still later, she wrote A Speckled Bird, and Devota. Critical response Augusta Evans Wilson was not a professional writer and her style was severely criticized as \\"pedantic.\\" She wrote in the domestic, sentimental style of the Victorian Age. Critics have praised the intellectual competence of her female characters, but as her heroes eventually succumb to traditional values, Wilson has been described as an antifeminist. Of St. Elmo one critic maintained, \\"the trouble with the heroine of St. Elmo was that she swallowed an unabridged dictionary.\\" Wilson was the first American woman author to earn over $100,000. This would be a record unsurpassed until Edith Wharton. Macaria, or Altars of Sacrifice, published in 1864, was popular with Southerners and Northerners alike. Melissa Homestead writes that the transportation of the novel to New York was deliberate, done in installments and nearly simultaneous with the novel's preparation for publication in the South. Thus, while previous critics, scholars and biographers have all treated Macaria‚Äôs appearance in the North as unauthorized, the truth is much more meaningful. Some scholars say that by dispensing with the romantic notion that the novel appeared in a \\"bootleg\\" edition, Homestead debunks the hard and fast distinction between Northern and Southern readerships as an invention of historians and critics rather than an accurate reflection of reading practices of the period. However, a great number of discrepancies exist between the version published in the North and the version published in the South, which remove huge portions of the text which romanticize the Southern heroes that are portrayed. Her novel St. Elmo was her most famous and it was frequently adapted for both the stage and screen. It inspired the naming of towns, hotels, steamboats, and a cigar brand. The book's heroine, Edna Earl, became the namesake of Eudora Welty's heroine (Edna Earle Ponder) in The Ponder Heart published in 1954. The novel also inspired a parody of itself called St. Twel'mo, or the Cuneiform Cyclopedist of Chattanooga (1867) by Charles Henry Webb. Death and legacy Mrs. August Evans Wilson (1894) Wilson had become wealthy through her marriage and her literary earnings and retired from writing during her final years. She died of a heart attack in Mobile on May 9, 1909, and is buried in Mobile's Magnolia Cemetery. Her beloved Ashland burned to the ground in 1926. However, Georgia Cottage is still standing with a historical marker on Springhill Avenue designating it as her home. Given her support for the Confederate States of America from the perspective of a Southern patriot, and her literary activities during the American Civil War, she can be deemed as having contributed decisively to the literary and cultural development of the Confederacy in particular, and of the South in general. She was inducted into the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1977 and was one of twelve inaugural inductees to the Alabama Writers Hall of Fame on June 8, 2015. A film and website on Wilson entitled The Passion of Miss Augusta was produced by Alabama filmmaker Robert Clem (2016), the 150th anniversary of the publication of St. Elmo. The film combines documentary interviews and dramatized scenes from St. Elmo as a silent film and a 1950s film showing how its story might have been told at a time when Eudora Welty, William Faulkner and Tennessee Williams were the face of Southern fiction. Interviews from the film as well as photographs and other exhibits have been collected in an online 'museum' on Wilson and her career.AL.com: New film on Augusta Evans Wilson, Mobile literary star from another era, gets free premiere Brenda Ayres write the biography, The Life and Works of Augusta Jane Evans Wilson, 1835‚Äì1909 (2016).

The districts of Araria, Katihar, Purnia and Kishanganj together from the Purnia division. =English rule and freedom struggle= The last of the Governors was Md. Ali Khan who was replaced in 1770 by Mr. Ducarrel, the first English supervisor or Collector. The early years of British rule were years of trouble for Purnia. The district suffered terribly during the great famine of 1770. From the old records, it appears that there were European settlers in Purnia almost immediately after the establishment of British rule in the district. By 1771, a number of Europeans had settled in the area known as Rambagh, the only building left in Rambagh was the church and the priests' houses. The Roman Catholic Church was dismantled and re-erected in the new station of Purnia where the Europeans had already set up their residences. The foundation of this new church was there until 1934, when it was badly affected by the Bihar earthquake. The church was dismantled again. The nuns of Loretto convent of Darjeeling had come to Purnia near about 1882 and had opened a day school as well as a boarding school for children in Purnia district. When the Jesuit Mission of Bengal took over the Purnia Mission from the Capuchin Mission, the school was closed and the nuns returned to Darjeeling. This house still stands and is known as the Coumblin. It is one of the oldest houses in Purnia town and is now occupied by the Allisons. Kisan Sabha movement, which had been responsible for an acute agitation in Purnia district in the third decade in 20th century and figured prominently for about 20 years, had its roots in the very agricultural economy and the precious structure of permanent land-lordism in this state. The Kisan Sabha was formed at Munger near about 1922‚Äì23. After 1940‚Äì41, the kisan sabha movement slowly merged into the Congress Movement. Purnia district, being so very contiguous to several districts of undivided Bengal, had been promptly affected by the swadeshi movement in the first decade of the 20th century. At that time there were no facilities for higher education in Purnia district and the students who sought higher education had to go to Calcutta or to Patna. The Bihar National College and TK Ghosh Academy were suspected as the two centers for a secret students organization, which indulged in sedition and both these institutions had a sprinkling of students from Purnia. A boy from Purnia, Atul Chandra Mazumdar, a student of the BN College, Patna was arrested under the Defence Act of India. Since 1919, Purnia had closely followed the policy, aims and objectives of the Indian National Congress. Some of the delegates of Purnia attended the Nagpur session of Congress in 1920 and the moment Mahatma Gandhi gave the call for the Non- Cooperation, there were a number of volunteers in this district. Some of the early local leaders were Gokul Krishna Roy, Satyendra Narayan Roy and a few others who gave up their practice in the Bar and joined the movement. In 1921, a national school was started in Katihar. Shri Rajendra Prasad toured Purnia district in 1921 and addressed meetings at Purnia and at other places. In 1942 Quit India Movement tactics were fully implemented by the people of Purnia. Mahatma Gandhi visited Purnia in 1929, during which time he met the Raja of Nazargunj and addressed crowded meetings at various places including Kisahnganj, Bishnupur, Araria and Purnia. The survey and settlement operations in Purnia district commenced in 1952 and settlement operations were concluded in 1960. During the 1911‚Äì20 period, Purnia suffered from epidemics of cholera every year from 1915 to 1919. A very serious outbreak of cholera occurred in 1925. Incidences of smallpox and malaria was very high during this period.

The amendment was named for its co-authors, Senator Harold E. Hughes (D-Iowa) and Representative Leo Ryan (D-CA). The amendment required the President of the United States to report all covert actions of the Central Intelligence Agency to one or more Congressional committees. This amendment addressed the question of CIA and Defense Department covert actions, and prohibited the use of appropriated funds for the conduct of such an action unless and until the President issues an official \\"Finding\\" that each such operation is important to national security, and submits this Finding to the appropriate Congressional committees (a total of six committees, at the time, which grew to eight committees after the House and Senate \\"select committees\\" on intelligence were established). The legislation was meant to ensure that the intelligence oversight committees within Congress were told of CIA actions within a reasonable time limit. Senator Hughes, in introducing the legislation in 1973, also saw it as a means of limiting major covert operations by military, intelligence, and national security agents conducted without the full knowledge of the president.  History  Congressman Leo Ryan By the early years of the 1970s, the unpopular war in Southeast Asia and the unfolding Watergate scandal brought the era of minimal oversight to a halt. The Congress was determined to rein in the Nixon administration, and to ascertain the extent to which the nation's intelligence agencies had been involved in questionable, if not outright illegal, activities. A major stimulus for the amendment came from 1972 and 1973 hearings of the Senate Armed Services Committee on covert military operations in Cambodia, Laos, and North Vietnam in the early 1970s. The committee had found that Air Force and Navy air elements had conducted secret air strikes, and falsified after-action reports to conceal this. To Hughes and several other senators, these activities represented a secret war conducted through back-channel communications from the White House directly to field commanders in the Pacific Theater and the Vietnam War. A series of troubling revelations appeared in the press concerning intelligence activities. On 22 December 1974, the New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing CIA operations that had been dubbed the \\"family jewels.\\", including lengthy covert action programs to assassinate foreign leaders and subvert foreign governments. The article also discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of American citizens. These revelations convinced many Senators and Representatives that the Congress had been too lax, trusting, and naive in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. The first legislative response was enactment, in 1974, of the Hughes‚ÄìRyan Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The act, as amended, established ultimate accountability of the President for all covert action conducted by the CIA, removing any \\"plausible deniability\\" for the President regarding exposed covert actions. It also expanded the circle of \\"witting\\" persons in Congress, which made covert operations to which Congress was opposed much more likely to be exposed by leaks. Thus, the passage of the amendment created both de facto and de jure Congressional veto power on covert operations, through the ability to leak and the power of the purse, respectively.

Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, error detection and correction algorithms, data compression, encryption algorithms, and optimization. For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Source code that does bit manipulation makes use of the bitwise operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and possibly other operations analogous to the boolean operators; there are also bit shifts and operations to count ones and zeros, find high and low one or zero, set, reset and test bits, extract and insert fields, mask and zero fields, gather and scatter bits to and from specified bit positions or fields. Integer arithmetic operators can also effect bit-operations in conjunction with the other operators. Bit manipulation, in some cases, can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can give many-fold speed ups, as bit manipulations are processed in parallel.  Terminology  Bit twiddling and bit bashing are often used interchangeably with bit manipulation, but sometimes exclusively refer to clever or non-obvious ways or uses of bit manipulation, or tedious or challenging low-level device control data manipulation tasks. The term bit twiddling dates from early computing hardware, where computer operators would make adjustments by tweaking or twiddling computer controls. As computer programming languages evolved, programmers adopted the term to mean any handling of data that involved bit-level computation.  Bitwise operation  A bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast, primitive action directly supported by the central processing unit (CPU), and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations. On most processors, the majority of bitwise operations are single cycle - substantially faster than division and multiplication and branches. While modern processors usually perform some arithmetic and logical operations just as fast as bitwise operations due to their longer instruction pipelines and other architectural design choices, bitwise operations do commonly use less power because of the reduced use of resources.  Example of bit manipulation  To determine if a number is a power of two, conceptually we may repeatedly do integer divide by two until the number won't divide by 2 evenly; if the only factor left is 1, the original number was a power of 2. Using bit and logical operators, there is a simple expression which will return true (1) or false (0): bool isPowerOfTwo = (x != 0) && ((x & (x - 1))  0); The second method uses the fact that powers of two have one and only one bit set in their binary representation: x  0...010...0 x-1  0...001...1 x & (x-1)  0...000...0 If the number is neither zero nor a power of two, it will have '1' in more than one place: x  0...1...010...0 x-1  0...1...001...1 x & (x-1)  0...1...000...0 If inline assembly language code is used, then an instruction that counts the number of 1's or 0's in the operand might be available; an operand with exactly one '1' bit is a power of 2. However, such an instruction may have greater latency than the bitwise method above.  Bit manipulation operations Processors typically provide only a subset of the useful bit operators. Programming languages don't directly support most bit operations, so idioms must be used to code them. The 'C' programming language, for example provides only bit-wise AND(&), OR(), XOR(^) and NOT(~). Fortran provides AND(.and.), OR (.or.), XOR (.neqv.) and EQV(.eqv.). Algol provides syntactic bitfield extract and insert. When languages provide bit operations that don't directly map to hardware instructions, compilers must synthesize the operation from available operators. An especially useful bit operation is count leading zeros used to find the high set bit of a machine word, though it may have different names on various architectures.On most Intel chips, it's BSR (bitscan reverse), though newer SoCs also have LZCNT (count leading zeros) There's no simple programming language idiom, so it must be provided by a compiler intrinsic or system library routine. Without that operator, it is very expensive (see Find first set#CLZ) to do any operations with regard to the high bit of a word, due to the asymmetric carry-propagate of arithmetic operations. Fortunately, most cpu architectures have provided that since the middle 1980s. An accompanying operation count ones, also called POPCOUNT, which counts the number of set bits in a machine word, is also usually provided as a hardware operator. Simpler bit operations like bit set, reset, test and toggle are often provided as hardware operators, but are easily simulated if they aren't - for example (SET R0, 1; LSHFT R0, i; OR x, R0) sets bit i in operand x. Some of the more useful and complex bit operations that must be coded as idioms in the programming language and synthesized by compilers include: *clear from specified bit position up (leave lower part of word) *clear from specified bit position down (leave upper part of word) *mask from low bit down (clear lower word) *mask from high bit up (clear lower word) *bitfield extract *bitfield insert *bitfield scatter/gather operations which distribute contiguous portions of a bitfield over a machine word, or gather disparate bitfields in the word into a contiguous portion of a bitfield (see recent Intel PEXT/PDEP operators). Used by cryptography and video encoding. *matrix inversion Some arithmetic operations can be reduced to simpler operations and bit operations: * reduce multiply by constant to sequence of shift-add Multiply by 9 for example, is copy operand, shift up by 3 (multiply by 8), and add to original operand. * reduce division by constant to sequence of shift-subtract = Masking = A mask is data that is used for bitwise operations, particularly in a bit field. Using a mask, multiple bits in a Byte, nibble, word (etc.) can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.

Historically, certain Native American tribes have had close relations with African Americans, especially in regions where slavery was prevalent or where free people of color have historically resided. Members of the Five Civilized Tribes participated in holding enslaved African Americans in the Southeast and some enslaved or formerly enslaved people migrated with them to the West on the Trail of Tears in 1830 and later during the period of Indian Removal. In peace treaties with the US after the American Civil War, the slaveholding tribes, which had sided with the Confederacy, were required to emancipate slaves and give them full citizenship rights in their nations. In controversial actions, since the late 20th century, the Cherokee, Creek and Seminole nations tightened their rules for membership and at times excluded Freedmen who did not have at least one ancestor listed as Native American on the early 20th-century Dawes Rolls. This exclusion was later appealed in the courts, both because of the treaty conditions and in some cases because of possible inaccuracies in some of the Rolls.

Overview Until recently, historic relations between Native Americans and African Americans were relatively neglected in mainstream United States history studies. At various times, Africans had varying degrees of contact with Native Americans, although they did not live together in as great number as with Europeans. African slaves brought to the United States and their descendants have had a history of cultural exchange and intermarriage with Native Americans, as well as with other enslaved mixed-race persons who had some Native American and European ancestry. Most interaction took place in New England where contact was earlyDaniel Mandell, ‚ÄúThe Saga of Sarah Muckamugg: Indian and African American Intermarriage in Colonial New England,‚Äù in Martha Hodes, ed. Sex, Love Race: Crossing Boundaries in North American History(New York: New York University Press, 1999), 72-90Tiffany McKinney, ‚ÄúRace and Federal Recognition in Native New England,‚Äù in Tiya Miles and Sharon Holland, eds. Crossing Waters, crossing Worlds: The African Diaspora in Indian Country (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2006), 57-79 and the Southern United States, where the largest number of African-descended people were enslaved. In the 21st century, a significant number of African Americans have some Native American ancestry, but most have not grown up within those cultures and do not have current social, cultural or linguistic ties to Native peoples. Relationships among different Native Americans, Africans, and African Americans have been varied and complex. Some tribes or bands were more accepting of ethnic Africans than others and welcomed them as full members of their respective cultures and communities. Native peoples often disagreed about the role of ethnic African people in their communities. Other Native Americans saw uses for slavery and did not oppose it for others. Some Native Americans and people of African descent fought alongside one another in armed struggles of resistance against U.S. expansion into Native territories, as in the Seminole Wars in Florida. Buffalo Soldiers, 1890. The nickname was given to the \\"Black Cavalry\\" by the Native American tribes they fought. After the American Civil War, some African Americans became or continued as members of the US Army. Many were assigned to fight against Native Americans in the wars in the Western frontier states. Their military units became known as the Buffalo Soldiers, a nickname given by Native Americans. Black Seminole men in particular were recruited from Indian Territory to work as Native American scouts for the Army. History =European colonization of the Americas= Records of contacts between Africans and Native Americans date to April of 1502, when the first enslaved African arrived in Hispaniola. Some Africans escaped inland from the colony of Santo Domingo; those who survived and joined with the native tribes became the first group of Black Indians.Katz, Black Indians, 28.Muslims in American History: A Forgotten Legacy by Dr. Jerald F. Dirks. Page 204. In the lands which later became part of the United States, the first recorded example of an African slave escaping from European colonists and being absorbed by Native Americans dates to 1526. In June of that year, Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n established a Spanish colony near the mouth of the Pee Dee River in present- day South Carolina. The Spanish settlement was named San Miguel de Guadalupe; its inhabitants included 100 enslaved Africans. In 1526 the first enslaved African fled the colony and took refuge with local Native Americans. In 1534 Pueblo peoples of the Southwest had contact with the Moroccan slave Esteban de Dorantes before any contact with the remainder of survivors of his Spanish expedition. As part of the Spanish P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez expedition, Esteban traveled from Florida in 1528 to what is now New Mexico in 1539, with a few other survivors. He is thought have been killed by Zuni.Flint, Richard and Shirley Cushing Flint. \\"Dorantes, Esteban de\\". New Mexico Office of the State Historian. 10 Aug 2013. More than a century later, when the Pueblos united to rid their homelands of the Spanish colonists during the 1690 Pueblo Revolt, one of the organizers of the revolt, Domingo Naranjo (ca. 1644‚Äìca. 1696) was a Santa Clara Pueblo man of African ancestry. In 1622 Algonquian Native Americans attacked the colony of Jamestown in Virginia. They massacred all the Europeans but brought some of the few African slaves as captives back to their own communities, gradually assimilating them. Interracial relationships continued to take place between Africans (and later African Americans) and members of Native American tribes in the coastal states. Although the colonists tried to enslave Native Americans in the early years, they abandoned the practise in the early 18th century. Several colonial advertisements for runaway slaves made direct reference to the connections which Africans had in Native American communities. \\"Reward notices in colonial newspapers now told of African slaves who 'ran off with his Indian wife' or 'had kin among the Indians' or is 'part-Indian and speaks their language good'.\\"Black NDNs. Retrieved 10 Aug 2013.Katz, Black Indians, p. 103. Several of the Thirteen Colonies passed laws prohibiting the transportation of slaves into the frontier of the Cherokee Nation's territory to restrict interactions between the two groups. European colonists told the Cherokee that the smallpox epidemic of 1739 in the Southeast was due to disease brought by African slaves. Some tribes encouraged intermarriage with Africans, with the idea that stronger children would result from the unions. Colonists in South Carolina felt so concerned about the possible threat posed by the mixed African and Native American population that they passed a law in 1725 prohibiting taking slaves to the frontier regions, and imposing a fine of 200 pounds if violated. In 1751, South Carolina passed a law against holding Africans in proximity to Native Americans, as the planters considered that detrimental to the security of the colony. Under Governor James Glen (in office 1743‚Äì1756), South Carolina promoted an official policy that aimed to create in Native Americans an \\"aversion\\" to African Americans in an attempt to thwart possible alliances between them. In 1753, during the chaos of Pontiac's War, a resident of Detroit observed that the Indian tribes revolting were killing any whites they came across but were ‚Äúsaving and caressing all the Negroes they take.‚Äù The resident expressed fear that this practise could eventually lead to a uprising amongst the slaves. Similarly, Iroquois chief Thayendanegea, more commonly known as Joseph Brant, similarly welcomed runaway slaves and encouraged them to intermarry in the tribe. Native American adoptions system did not discriminate on the basis of color, and Indian villages would eventually serve as stations on the Underground Railroad. Historian Carter G. Woodson believed that relations with Native American tribes could have provided an escape hatch from slavery: Native American villages welcomed fugitive slaves and, in the antebellum years, some served as stations on the Underground Railroad. Diana Fletcher (b. 1838), Black Seminole who was adopted into the Kiowa tribe\\"Diana Fletcher.\\" Women in History-Ohio. Accessed 18 May 2014. There were varieties of attitude: some Native Americans resented the presence of Africans.Red, White, and Black, p. 99. In one account, the \\"Catawaba tribe in 1752 showed great anger and bitter resentment when an African American came among them as a trader.\\" European and European-American colonists tried to divide Native Americans and African Americans against each other. Europeans considered both races inferior and tried to convince Native Americans that Africans worked against their best interests.Red, White, and Black, p. 105, In the colonial period, Native Americans received rewards if they returned escaped slaves. In the latter 19th century, African-American soldiers had assignments to fight with U.S. forces in Indian Wars in the West. =European enslavement= European colonists created a new demand market for captives of raids when they founded what would go on to become the Thirteen Colonies. Especially in the southern colonies, initially developed for resource exploitation rather than settlement, colonists purchased or captured Native Americans to be used as forced labor in cultivating tobacco, and, by the eighteenth century, rice and indigo. To acquire trade goods, Native Americans began selling war captives to whites rather than integrating them into their own societies.Snyder (2010), \\"Indian Slave Trade\\" [Ch. 2], in Slavery, pp. 46-79. Traded goods, such as axes, bronze kettles, Caribbean rum, European jewelry, needles, and scissors, varied among the tribes, but the most prized were rifles. The English copied the Spanish and Portuguese: they saw the enslavement of Africans and Native Americans as a moral, legal, and socially acceptable institution; a rationale for enslavement was \\"just war\\" taking captives and using slavery as an alternative to a death sentence. The escape of Native American slaves was frequent, because they had a better understanding of the land, which African slaves did not. Consequently, the Natives who were captured and sold into slavery were often sent to the West Indies, or far away from their traditional homeland. The oldest known record of a permanent Native American slave was a native man from Massachusetts in 1636. By 1661 slavery had become legal in all of the thirteen colonies. Virginia would later declare that \\"Indians, Mulattos, and Negros to be real estate\\", and in 1682 New York forbade African or Native American slaves from leaving their master's home or plantation without permission. Europeans also viewed the enslavement of Native Americans differently than the enslavement of Africans in some cases; a belief that Africans were \\"brutish people\\" was dominant. While both Native Americans and Africans were considered savages, Native Americans were romanticized as noble people that could be elevated into Christian civilization. It is estimated that Carolina traders operating out of Charles Town exported an estimated 30,000 to 51,000 Native American captives between 1670 and 1715 in a profitable slave trade with the Caribbean, Spanish Hispaniola, and Northern colonies.Krauthamer (2013), \\"Black Slaves, Indian Masters\\" [Ch. 1], in Black Slaves, pp. 17‚Äì45. It was more profitable to have Native American slaves because African slaves had to be shipped and purchased, while native slaves could be captured and immediately taken to plantations; whites in the Northern colonies sometimes preferred Native American slaves, especially Native women and children, to Africans because Native American women were agriculturalist and children could be trained more easily. However, Carolinians had more of a preference for African slaves but also capitalized on the Indian slave trade combining both. By the late 1700s records of slaves mixed with African and Native American heritage were recorded.Lauber (1913), \\"The Number of Indian Slaves\\" [Ch. IV], in Indian Slavery, pp. 105-117. In the eastern colonies it became common practice to enslave Native American women and African men with a parallel growth of enslavement for both Africans and Native Americans. This practice also lead to large number of unions between Africans and Native Americans. This practice of combining African slave men and Native American women was especially common in South Carolina. During this time records also show that many Native American women bought African men but, unknown to the European traders, the women freed and married the men into their tribe. The Indian wars of the early 18th century, combined with the growing availability of African slaves, essentially ended the Indian Slave trade by 1750. Numerous colonial slave traders had been killed in the fighting, and the remaining Native American groups banded together, more determined to face the Europeans from a position of strength rather than be enslaved. Though the Indian Slave Trade ended the practice of enslaving Native Americans continued, records from June 28, 1771 show Native American children were kept as slaves in Long Island, New York. Native Americans had also married while enslaved creating families both native and some of partial African descent. Occasional mentioning of Native American slaves running away, being bought, or sold along with Africans in newspapers is found throughout the later colonial period. There are also many accounts of former slaves mentioning having a parent or grandparent who was Native American or of partial descent. Ads asked for the return of both African American and Native American slaves. Records and slave narratives obtained by the WPA (Works Progress Administration) clearly indicate that the enslavement of Native Americans continued in the 1800s mostly through kidnappings. The abductions showed that even in the 1800s little distinction was still made between African Americans and Native Americans. Both Native American and African-American slaves were at risk of sexual abuse by slaveholders and other white men of power. During the transitional period of Africans' becoming the primary race enslaved, Native Americans had been sometimes enslaved at the same time. Africans and Native Americans worked together, lived together in communal quarters, along with white indentured servants, produced collective recipes for food, and shared herbal remedies, myths and legends. Some intermarried and had mixed-race children. The exact number of Native Americans who were enslaved is unknown because vital statistics and census reports were at best infrequent. Andr√©s Res√©ndez estimates that between 147,000 and 340,000 Native Americans were enslaved in North America, excluding Mexico. Among the Cherokee, interracial marriages or unions increased as the number of slaves held by the tribe increased. The Cherokee had a reputation for having slaves work side by side with their owners. The Cherokee resistance to the Euro-American system of chattel slavery created tensions between them and European Americans. The Cherokee tribe began to become divided; as intermarriage between white men and native women increased and there was increased adoption of European culture, so did racial discrimination against those of African-Cherokee blood and against African slaves. Cultural assimilation among the tribes, particularly the Cherokee, created pressure to be accepted by European Americans. After Indian slavery was ended in the colonies, some African men chose Native American women as their partners because their children would be born free. From 1622 in Virginia, and followed by other colonies, they had established a law, known as partus sequitur ventrem, that said a child's status followed that of the mother. Separately, according to the matrilineal system among many Native American tribes, children were considered to be born to and to belong to the mother's people, so were raised as Native American. As European expansion increased in the Southeast, African and Native American marriages became more common. =1800s through the Civil War= John Horse, a Black Seminole In the early 19th century, the US government believed that some tribes had become extinct, especially on the East Coast, where there had been a longer period of European settlement, and where most Native Americans had lost their communal land. Few reservations had been established and they were considered landless. At that time, the government did not have a separate census designation for Native Americans. Those who remained among the European-American communities were frequently listed as mulatto, a term applied to Native American-white, Native American-African, and African-white mixed-race people, as well as tri-racial people. The Seminole people of Florida formed in the 18th century, in what is called ethnogenesis, from Muscogee (Creek) and Florida tribes. They incorporated some Africans who had escaped from slavery. Other maroons formed separate communities near the Seminole, and were allied with them in military actions. Much intermarriage took place. African Americans living near the Seminole were called Black Seminole. Several hundred people of African descent traveled with the Seminole when they were removed to Indian Territory. Others stayed with the few hundred Seminole who remained in Florida, undefeated by the Americans. By contrast, an 1835 census of the Cherokee showed that 10% were of African descent. In those years, censuses of the tribes classified people of mixed Native American and African descent as \\"Native American\\".Knickmeyer, Ellen. \\"Cherokee Nation To Vote on Expelling Slaves' Descendants\\", Washington Post, 3 March 2007 (Accessible as of July 13, 2007 here ) But during the registration of tribal members for the Dawes Rolls, which preceded land allotment by individual heads of household of the tribes, generally Cherokee Freedmen were classified separately on a Freedmen roll. Registrars often worked quickly, judging by appearance, without asking if the freedmen had Cherokee ancestry, which would have qualified them as \\"Cherokee by blood\\" and listing on those rolls. This issue has caused problems for their descendants in the late 20th and 21st- century. The Nation passed legislation and a constitutional amendment to make membership more restrictive, open only to those with certificates of blood ancestry (CDIB), with proven descent from \\"Cherokee by blood\\" individuals on the Dawes Rolls. Western frontier artist George Catlin described \\"Negro and North American Indian, mixed, of equal blood\\" and stated they were \\"the finest built and most powerful men I have ever yet seen.\\" By 1922 John Swanton's survey of the Five Civilized Tribes noted that half the Cherokee Nation consisted of Freedmen and their descendants. Former slaves and Native Americans intermarried in northern states as well. Massachusetts Vital Records prior to 1850 included notes of \\"Marriages of 'negroes' to Indians\\". By 1860 in some areas of the South, where race was considered binary of black (mostly enslaved) or white, white legislators thought the Native Americans no longer qualified as \\"Native American,\\" as many were mixed and part black. They did not recognized that many mixed-race Native Americans identified as Indian by culture and family. Legislators wanted to revoke the Native American tax exemptions. Freed African Americans, Black Indians, and Native Americans fought in the American Civil War against the Confederate Army. During November 1861, the Muscogee Creek and Black Indians, led by Creek Chief Opothleyahola, fought three pitched battles against Confederate whites and allied Native Americans to reach Union lines in Kansas and offer their services. Some Black Indians served in colored regiments with other African-American soldiers. Black Indians were documented in the following regiments: The 1st Kansas Colored Infantry, the Kansas Colored at Honey Springs, the 79th US Colored Infantry, and the 83rd US Colored Infantry, along with other colored regiments that included men listed as Negro. Some Civil War battles occurred in Indian Territory. The first battle in Indian Territory took place July 1 and 2 in 1863, and Union forces included the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry. The first battle against the Confederacy outside Indian Territory occurred at Horse Head Creek, Arkansas on February 17, 1864. The 79th US Colored Infantry participated. Many Black Indians returned to Indian Territory after the Civil War had been won by the Union. When the Confederacy and its Native American allies were defeated, the US required new peace treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes, requiring them to emancipate slaves and make those who chose to stay with the tribes full citizens of their nations, with equal rights in annuities and land allotments. The former slaves were called \\"Freedmen,\\" as in Cherokee Freedmen, Chickasaw Freedmen, Choctaw Freedmen, Creek Freedmen and Seminole Freedmen. The pro-Union branch of the Cherokee government had freed their slaves in 1863, before the end of the war, but the pro-Confederacy Cherokee held their slaves until forced to emancipate them.Taylor, Quintard. \\"Cherokee Emancipation Proclamation (1863)\\", The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed (retrieved 10 January 2010). =Native American slave ownership= Slavery had existed among Native Americans, as a way to make use of war captives, before it was introduced by the Europeans. It was not the same as the European style of chattel slavery, in which slaves were counted as the personal property of a master. In Cherokee oral tradition, they enslaved war captives and it was a temporary status pending adoption into a family and clan, or release.Russell, Steve (2002). \\"Apples are the Color of Blood\\", Critical Sociology, Vol. 28, 1, 2002, p. 70. As the United States Constitution and the laws of several states permitted slavery after the American Revolution (while northern states prohibited it), Native Americans were legally allowed to own slaves, including those brought from Africa by Europeans. In the 1790s, Benjamin Hawkins was the federal agent assigned to the southeastern tribes. Promoting assimilation to European-American mores, he advised the tribes to take up slaveholding so that they could undertake farming and plantations as did other Americans. The Cherokee tribe had the most members who held black slaves, more than any other Native American nation.Littlefield, Daniel F. Jr. The Cherokee Freedmen: From Emancipation to American Citizenship, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1978, p. 68. Records from the slavery period show several cases of brutal Native American treatment of black slaves. However, most Native American masters rejected the worst features of Southern practices. Federal Agent Hawkins considered the form of slavery as practiced by the Southern tribes to be inefficient because the majority didn't practice chattel slavery. Travelers reported enslaved Africans \\"in as good circumstances as their masters\\". A white Indian Agent, Douglas Cooper, upset by the Native American failure to practice more severe rules, insisted that Native Americans invite white men to live in their villages and \\"control matters\\". Though less than 3% of Native Americans owned slaves, the fact of a racial caste system and bondage, and pressure from European-American culture, created destructive cleavages in their villages. Some already had a class hierarchy based on \\"white blood\\", in part because Native Americans of mixed race sometimes had stronger networks with traders for goods they wanted. Among some bands, Native Americans of mixed white blood stood at the top, pure Native Americans next, and people of African descent were at the bottom. Some of the status of partial white descent may have been related to the economic and social capital passed on by white relations. Members of Native groups held numerous African- American slaves through the Civil War. Some of these slaves later recounted their lives for a WPA oral history project during the Great Depression in the 1930s. =Native American Freedmen= Members of the Creek (Muscogee) Nation in Oklahoma around 1877. Note mixed European, African and Native American ancestry. L to R, Lochar Harjo, principal chief; unidentified man, John McGilvry, and Silas Jefferson or Hotulko micco (Chief of the Whirlwind). The latter two were interpreters and negotiators.Hudson, Charles. The Southeastern Indians, 1976, p. 479. After the Civil War, in 1866 the United States government required new treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes, who each had major factions allied with the Confederacy. They were required to emancipate their slaves and grant them citizenship and membership in the respective tribes, as the United States freed slaves and granted them citizenship by amendments to the US Constitution. These people were known as \\"Freedmen,\\" for instance, Muscogee or Cherokee Freedmen. Similarly, the Cherokee were required to reinstate membership for the Delaware, who had earlier been given land on their reservation, but fought for the Union during the war.\\"Delaware Tribe of Indians Supports Cherokee Freedmen Treaty Rights\\" , Descendants of Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes, 2004, accessed 6 October 2009. Many of the Freedmen played active political roles in their tribal nations over the ensuing decades, including roles as interpreters and negotiators with the federal government. African Muscogee men, such as Harry Island and Silas Jefferson, helped secure land for their people when the government decided to make individual allotments to tribal members under the Dawes Act. Some Maroon communities allied with the Seminole in Florida and intermarried. The Black Seminole included those with and without Native American ancestry. When the Cherokee Nation drafted its constitution in 1975, enrollment was limited to descendants of people listed on the Dawes \\"Cherokee By Blood\\" rolls. On the Dawes Rolls, US government agents had classified people as Cherokee by blood, intermarried whites, and Cherokee Freedmen, regardless of whether the latter had Cherokee ancestry qualifying them as Cherokee by blood. The Shawnee and Delaware gained their own federal recognition as the Delaware Tribe of Indians and the Shawnee Tribe. A political struggle over this issue has ensued since the 1970s. Cherokee Freedmen have taken cases to the Cherokee Supreme Court. The Cherokee later reinstated the rights of Delaware to be considered members of the Cherokee, but opposed their bid for independent federal recognition. The Cherokee Nation Supreme Court ruled in March 2006 that Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for tribal enrollment. In 2007, leaders of the Cherokee Nation held a special election to amend their constitution to restrict requirements for citizenship in the tribe. The referendum established direct Cherokee ancestry as a requirement. The measure passed in March 2007, thereby forcing out Cherokee Freedmen and their descendants unless they also had documented, direct \\"Cherokee by blood\\" ancestry. This has caused much controversy. The tribe has determined to limit membership only to those who can demonstrate Native American descent based on listing on the Dawes Rolls. Similarly, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma moved to exclude Seminole Freedmen from membership. In 1990 it received $56 million from the US government as reparations for lands taken in Florida. Because the judgment trust was based on tribal membership as of 1823, it excluded Seminole Freedmen, as well as Black Seminoles who held land next to Seminole communities. In 2000 the Seminole chief moved to formally exclude Black Seminoles unless they could prove descent from a Native American ancestor on the Dawes Rolls. 2,000 Black Seminoles were excluded from the nation.Brendan I. Koerner, \\"Blood Feud\\", Wired 13.09, accessed 3 June 2008. Descendants of Freedmen and Black Seminoles are working to secure their rights. > \\"There's never been any stigma about intermarriage\\", says Stu Phillips, > editor of The Seminole Producer, a local newspaper in central Oklahoma. > \\"You've got Indians marrying whites, Indians marrying blacks. It was never a > problem until they got some money.\\" An advocacy group representing descendants of Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes claims that members are entitled to be citizens in both the Seminole and Cherokee Nations, as many are indeed part Native American by blood, with records to prove it. Because of racial discrimination, their ancestors were classified and listed incorrectly, under only the category of Freedmen, at the time of the Dawes Rolls. In addition, the group notes that post-Civil War treaties of these tribes with the US government required they give African Americans full citizenship upon emancipation, regardless of blood quantum. In many cases, Native American descent has been difficult for people to trace from historical records.\\"History\\" , Descendants of Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes, 2 August 2005, accessed 6 October 2009. Over 25,000 Freedmen descendants of the Five Civilized Tribes may be affected by the legal controversies. The Dawes Commission enrollment records, intended to establish rolls of tribal members for land allocation purposes, were done under rushed conditions by a variety of recorders. Many tended to exclude Freedmen from Cherokee rolls and enter them separately, even when they claimed Cherokee descent, had records of it, and had Cherokee physical features. Descendants of Freedmen see the tribe's contemporary reliance on the Dawes Rolls as a racially based way to exclude them from citizenship.\\"Myths\\" , Descendants of Freedmen of the 5 Civilized Tribes, 2 August 2005, accessed 6 October 2009\\"History\\" , Descendants of Freedmen of the 5 Civilized Tribes, 2 August 2005, accessed 6 October 2009.

After the Dawes Commission established tribal rolls, in some cases Freedmen of the Cherokee and the other Five Civilized Tribes were treated more harshly. Degrees of continued acceptance into tribal structures were low during the ensuing decades. Some tribes restricted membership to those with a documented Native ancestor on the Dawes Commission listings, and many restricted officeholders to those of direct Native American ancestry. In the later 20th century, it was difficult for Black Native Americans to establish official ties with Native groups to which they genetically belonged. Many Freedmen descendants believe that their exclusion from tribal membership, and the resistance to their efforts to gain recognition, are racially motivated and based on the tribe's wanting to preserve the new gambling revenues for fewer people.William Loren Katz, \\"Racism and the Cherokee Nation\\", Final Call.com, 8 April 2007. Genealogy and genetics George Bonga (1802‚Äì1880), \\"African American and Ojibwe fur trader L to R: Mrs. Amos Chapman, her daughter, sister (all Southern Cheyenne, and an unidentified girl of African American descent. 1886 African Americans looking to trace their genealogy can face many difficulties. While a number of the Native American Nations are better- documented than the white communities of the era, the destruction of family ties and family records during the human trafficking of the Atlantic slave trade has made tracking African American family lines much more difficult. In Black Indians: A Hidden Heritage, William Katz writes that the number of Black Indians among the Native American Nations were \\"understated by hundreds of thousands\\"; and that by comparing pictorial documentation to verbal and written accounts it is clear that when Black Indians were spotted in these settings, they were often simply not remarked upon or recorded by white chroniclers of the era. Enslaved Africans were renamed by those who enslaved them, and usually not even recorded with surnames until after the American Civil War. Historical records usually relied upon by genealogists, such as censuses, did not record the names of enslaved African Americans before the Civil war. While some major slavers kept extensive records, which historians and genealogists have used to create family trees, generally researchers find it difficult to trace African American families before the Civil War. Enslaved people were also forbidden to learn to read and write, and harshly punished or even killed if they defied this ban, making records kept by families themselves extremely rare. Elder family members may have tried to keep an oral history of the family, but due to these many difficulties, these accounts have not always been as reliable as hoped for. Knowing the family's geographic origins may help individuals know where to start in piecing together their genealogy. Working from oral history and what records exist, descendants can try to confirm stories of more precise African origins, and any possible Native ancestry through genealogical research and even DNA testing. However, DNA cannot reliably indicate Native American ancestry, and no DNA test can indicate tribal origin. DNA testing and research has provided some data about the extent of Native American ancestry among African Americans, which varies in the general population. Based on the work of geneticists, Harvard University historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr. hosted a popular, and at times controversial, PBS series, African American Lives, in which geneticists said DNA evidence shows that Native American ancestry is far less common among African Americans than previously believed. Their conclusions were that while almost all African Americans are racially mixed, and many have family stories of Native heritage, usually these stories turn out to be inaccurate, with only 5 percent of African American people showing more than 2 percent Native American ancestry. Gates summarized these statistics to mean that, \\"If you have 2 percent Native American ancestry, you had one such ancestor on your family tree five to nine generations back (150 to 270 years ago).\\" Their findings also concluded that the most common \\"non-black\\" mix among African Americans is English and Scots-Irish. Some critics thought the PBS series did not sufficiently explain the limitations of DNA testing for assessment of heritage. Another study, published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, also indicated that, despite how common these family stories are, relatively few African-Americans who have these stories actually turned out to have detectable Native American ancestry. A study reported in The American Journal of Human Genetics stated, \\"We analyzed the European genetic contribution to 10 populations of African descent in the United States (Maywood, Illinois; Detroit; New York; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Baltimore; Charleston, South Carolina; New Orleans; and Houston) ... mtDNA haplogroups analysis shows no evidence of a significant maternal Amerindian contribution to any of the 10 populations.\\" Despite this, some still insist that most African Americans have at least some Native American heritage. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. wrote in 2009, Geneticists from Kim Tallbear (Dakota) to The Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB) agree that DNA testing is not how tribal identity is determined, with Tallbear stressing that and the IPCB noting that > \\"Native American markers\\" are not found solely among Native Americans. While > they occur more frequently among Native Americans they are also found in > people in other parts of the world. Tallbear also stresses that tribal identity is based in political citizenship, culture, lineage and family ties, not \\"blood\\", \\"race\\", or genetics. Writing for ScienceDaily, Troy Duster wrote that the two common types of tests used are Y-chromosome and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) testing. The tests processes for direct-line male and female ancestors. Each follows only one line among many ancestors and thus can fail to identify others. Though DNA testing for ancestry is limited, a paper in 2015 posited that ancestries can show different percentages based on the region and sex of one's ancestors. These studies found that on average, people who identified as African American in their sample group had 73.2-82.1% West African, 16.7%-29% European, and 0.8‚Äì2% Native American genetic ancestry, with large variation between individuals.Henry Louis Gates, Jr., \\"Exactly How ‚ÄòBlack‚Äô Is Black America?\\", The Root, February 11, 2013. Autosomal DNA testing surveys DNA that has been inherited from parents of an individual. Autosomal tests focus on genetic markers which might be found in Africans, Asians, and people from every other part of the world. DNA testing still cannot determine an individual's full ancestry with absolute certitude. Notable Black Native Americans Claims of African American and Native American identity are often disputed. As Sharon P. Holland and Tiya Miles note, \\"Pernicious cultural definitions of race ... structure this divide, as blackness has been capaciously defined by various state laws according to the legendary one-drop rule, while Indianness has been defined by the US government according to the many buckets rule.\\" The list below contains notable individuals with African American ancestry who are tribal citizens and/or who have been recognized by their communities. =Historic= * William Apess (African-Pequot, 1798‚Äì1839), Methodist minister and author.Barry O'Connell, ed., A Son of the Forest and Other Writings, University of Massachusetts, 1997, p. 3O'Connell, Barry, ed.

Biography √Ålvarez was born at a time of massive immigration in Argentina. His father, Seraf√≠n √Ålvarez, was an exiled Republican Spaniard; within the family, discussions about society, politics and religion were common. He studied at the Faculty of Law in Buenos Aires, where the ruling class of the time was raised. His doctoral thesis was evaluated by Bartolom√© Mitre. Since 1902, he worked at the Tribunals of Rosario, as a secretary, attorney, prosecutor and judge. He lived most of his life in this dynamic and rapidly growing city of the province of Santa Fe, and made friends within the professional and business elite, as well as firm links with other Argentine intellectuals. He was of a liberal mindset, opposed to nationalism and the tendency to worship tradition. His first books argued that the roots of a nationality should not be sought in the old times, but in the future. This topic was especially relevant due to the wave of nationalistic pride sweeping Argentina near the centennial of its liberation from Spain (the May Revolution of 1810). In his Essay on the history of Santa Fe he went as far as claiming that Argentine history is nonexistent before 1853 (year of the framing of Constitution). The main entrance of the Biblioteca Argentina on Presidente Roca St., Rosario. In 1913, √Ålvarez founded a public library in Rosario. This library, which is the largest in the city, carries at present the name of Biblioteca Argentina Dr. Juan √Ålvarez. In 1914, √Ålvarez wrote about the civil wars of Argentina from an economic point of view, and explicitly looking to prevent similar wars in the future. World War I and the Russian Revolution of 1917 affected his liberal mindset, which led him to write a criticism of liberalism and its limitations. Similar crises came after the S√°enz Pe√±a Law of secret and compulsory suffrage and the conservative revolution of 1930. √Ålvarez turned towards conservatism, unsure about the new developments in the relationship between citizens, institutions and the state. In 1943, he wrote Historia de Rosario (1689-1939) (\\"History of Rosario\\"), which, like other works that deal with the interaction of geography, economy and politics, is considered a seminal work, which introduces the concept of the city as a subject matter, starting from its local identity, without a forced reference to national matters. His thesis about the asymmetric relationships between his adopted home town, Rosario, and the capital city of Santa Fe, opposes the dynamism of the former (devoid of a colonial past or an aristocratic class) and the bureaucratic tradition of the latter. This idea is still considered valid and continues to re-emerge in popular and intellectual discourse today. √Ålvarez was the Attorney General of the Nation between 1935 and 1946. He died in Rosario in 1954.

He was born in St. Peter on 20 November 1820 and studied at the University of Caen and the Sorbonne. He was admitted to the Bar of Jersey as advocate in 1845, but in 1846 the family moved to Blois in France as a result of his mother's ill health. Returning to Jersey, he entered the political scene and was elected Constable of St. Helier in 1856. During his short term in municipal office, he laid out the Parade as an urban promenade. The death of the Bailiff, Sir Thomas Le Breton, created a vacancy among the Crown Officers and on 6 March 1858 Robert Pipon Marett was appointed Solicitor-General. He rose through the legal hierarchy, becoming Attorney-General in 1866, and Bailiff in 1880. He was knighted in 1880. He was one of the founders of the Soci√©t√© Jersiaise and a patron of education for girls. He was the father of Robert Ranulph Marett. He died on the 10 November 1884 at his home, La Haule Manor in St. Brelade, after a long illness. Literature On his return from Blois, Robert Pipon Marett was one of the founders of the newspaper La Patrie in which his poetry in J√®rriais appeared from 1849 under the pseudonym Laelius. His La Fille Malade was widely admired and Fran√ßois-Victor Hugo reproduced it in his La Normandie inconnue. It has been suggested that his L√© R'tou du Terre-Neuvi opr√®s san prumi viage influenced Victor Hugo's Les Pauvres gens written in Jersey in 1854. He corresponded publicly in verse form with George M√©tivier, the Guernsey poet. His comparatively small poetic output belies its continuing influence. His poetry is generally social rather than political, but La Bouonne Femme et ses Cotillons satirises conservative resistance to constitutional reform. He took a philological interest in J√®rriais and through his prestige did much to standardise J√®rriais orthography on the pattern of French orthography. On being appointed to high office he stopped publishing poetry, and a fire at his home, Blanc Pignon, in St. Brelade in 1874 destroyed his papers ‚Äì a loss to J√®rriais literature.

Classically, binitarianism is understood as a form of monotheism‚Äîthat is, that God is absolutely one being‚Äîand yet with binitarianism there is a \\"twoness\\" in God, which means one God family. The other common forms of monotheism are \\"unitarianism\\", a belief in one God with one person, and \\"trinitarianism\\", a belief in one God with three persons. The term binitarianism is sometimes used self-descriptively. It also relates to the term \\"Ditheism/Bitheism\\", a belief in two Gods working complementarily or antonymously (related conceptions are covered in \\"dualistic cosmology\\").  Scholarly views of early Christian theology  Larry W. Hurtado of University of Edinburgh uses the word \\"binitarian\\" to describe the position of early Christian devotion to God, which ascribes to the Son (Jesus) an exaltedness that in Judaism would be reserved for God alone, while still affirming as in Judaism that God is one and is alone to be worshiped. He writes: > ...there are a fairly consistent linkage and subordination of Jesus to God > 'the Father' in these circles, evident even in the Christian texts from the > latter decades of the 1st century that are commonly regarded as a very > 'high' Christology, such as the Gospel of John and Revelation. This is why I > referred to this Jesus-devotion as a 'binitarian' form of monotheism: there > are two distinguishable figures (God and Jesus), but they are posited in a > relation to each other that seems intended to avoid the ditheism of two > gods. Hurtado does not describe binitarianism as antithetical to Nicene Christianity but rather as an indication that early Christians (before Nicaea) were monotheistic (as evidenced by their singular reference to the Father as God) yet also devoted to Jesus as pre-existent, co-eternal, the creator, embodying the power of God, by whom the Father is revealed, and in whose name alone the Father is worshiped. He writes, \\"The central place given to Jesus ... and ... their concern to avoid ditheism by reverencing Jesus rather consistently with reference to 'the Father', combine to shape the proto-orthodox 'binitarian' pattern of devotion. Jesus truly is reverenced as divine.\\" Hurtado's view might be interpreted as urging that, at this stage in the development of the Church's understanding, it could be said that God is a person (the Father) and one being; and that Jesus is distinct from the Father, was pre-existent with God, and also originating from God without becoming a being separate from him, so that he is God (the Son). This view of a would posit a unity of God's being and a oneness of the object of worship, which is sympathetic to its predecessor view in Judaism; and it also displays a plurality of simultaneous identities, which is sympathetic to its successor in trinitarianism. It is a development in understanding of Christ, in other words, from which arose several subsequent ones in the further course of development that eventually came into conflict with one another. Before Hurtado's influential work, one classic scholarly theory of binitarianism was that the Holy Spirit was seen as in some sense identical to the Son or uniquely embodied in him. The Shepherd of Hermas, among other sources, is cited to support the theory. Near the end of Parable Five, for example, an angel declares: > The preexistent Holy Spirit, which created the whole creation, God caused to > live in the flesh that he wished. This flesh, therefore, in which the Holy > Spirit lived served the Spirit well, living in holiness and purity, without > defiling the Spirit in any way. ... [I]t had lived honorably and chastely, > and had worked with the Spirit and cooperated with it in everything. The classic theory of Christian binitarian theology (assumed by most dictionary definitions) asserts that some early Christians conceived of the Spirit as going out from God the creator, and is the creator: a person of God's being, which also lived in Jesus (or, from other sources, appears to be thought of as Jesus's pre-existent, divine nature). This view further asserts that the same Spirit is given to men, making them a new creation and sharers in the same hope of resurrection and exaltation. This interpretation of early Christian belief is often cited in contrast to trinitarianism. However, trinitarians cite the same sources as examples of pre-Nicene Christian monotheism, which is not orthodoxy but \\"proto-orthodox\\"‚Äîthat is, one of several versions among Christians which explain monotheism as a plurality (Father, Son, Spirit) in one being, prior to orthodoxy's settlement in Christianity. By the time of the Arian controversy, some bishops defended a kind of \\"dual\\" conception of deity, which is sometimes called \\"Semi-Arian\\". Macedonianism (the Pneumatomachi) typifies this view, which some prefer to call \\"binitarian\\" as at that time the Semi-Arians were the main binitarians. None of the Semi-Arian views were strictly monotheistic (one being). All asserted that the God who speaks and the Word who creates are two beings similar to one another, of similar substance ( []), and denied that they are one and the same being, or two persons of the same substance ( []) in which two are distinguished, as Nicaea eventually held.  History  Many Church of God binitarians (see below) believe their Christology perspective most accurately reflects that of the \\"original\\" Jewish Christians. Certain scholars have noted that \\"earliest Christian worship specifies two figures, God and Jesus, as recipients\\" and that early rabbis considered early Christianity to be binitarian. Near the end of the 2nd century, Melito of Sardis (whom Catholics among others consider a saint) wrote, \\"No eye can see Him, nor thought apprehend Him, nor language describe Him; and those who love Him speak of Him thus: 'Father, and God of Truth.'\\" He also wrote, \\"For the deeds done by Christ after His baptism, and especially His miracles, gave indication and assurance to the world of the Deity hidden in His flesh. For, being at once both God and perfect man likewise ... He concealed the signs of His Deity, although He was the true God existing before all ages\\" This clearly shows that Melito considered Christ to be God, as well as the Father. There is no indication in any of the surviving writings of Melito that he considered the Holy Spirit also God. Furthermore, the following passage suggests that he seemed to hold a binitarian view, \\"The finger of the Lord‚Äîthe Holy Spirit, by whose operation the tables of the law in Exodus are said to have been written.\\" After the 325 Council of Nicaea defeated Arianism, the Council of Constantinople was called in 381 to attempt to deal with the binitarians, who were referred to as \\"Semi-Arians\\". However, as the Trinity was finalized at this time as official Christian doctrine, the offended Semi-Arians walked out. \\"They rejected the Arian view that Christ was created and had a different nature from God ( []‚Äîdissimilar), but neither did they accept the Nicene Creed which stated that Christ was 'of one substance ( []) with the Father'. Semi- Arians taught that Christ was similar ( []) to the Father, or of like substance ( []), but still subordinate.\\" In the mid-4th century, orthodox apologist Epiphanius of Salamis noted, \\"Semi-Arians ... hold the truly orthodox view of the Son, that he was forever with the Father ... but has been begotten without beginning and not in time ... But all of these blaspheme the Holy Spirit, and do not count him in the Godhead with the Father and the Son.\\" Binitarians believe that other later groups throughout history (such as some who were called Paulicians, Albigensians, or Bogomils) were holders of a binitarian view. However, since these were names that the Roman Church coined for what it considered to be heretical gnostic sects, it is not always entirely clear what these groups may have affirmed. Dualistic faiths, as many forms of gnosticism were, often conceived of the \\"Logos\\" as a demiurge; these have consistently been considered heretics by many in the Catholic or Protestant faiths, \\"A heresy during the Middle Ages that developed in the town Albi in Southern France. This error taught that there were two gods ... The Albigenses taught that Jesus was God but that He only appeared as a man while on earth.\\" But again, not all identified as Albigenses were binitarian and those that were binitarian would have stated that Jesus was only a man on earth, not that He only appeared as a man. Binitarians strongly dispute that they are Gnostic and claim that history supports this‚Äîand state, for example, that if Melito was binitarian (which is a subject of debate), then binitarians did not derive from any form of Gnosticism. After Ellen White gained influence in the American Adventist movement, in 1858 the binitarian Church of God (Seventh Day) was founded in the U.S. mid-western states of Michigan and Iowa having split from those Adventists who in 1863 founded the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Later, in 1897, Ellen White published a pamphlet declaring the Holy Spirit \\"the third person of the Godhead\\". Andrews University, an Adventist institution for higher learning, suggests that the Seventh-day Adventists were inclined towards binitarianism before this, which Gerhard Pfandl terms \\"Semi-Arian.\\"  Church of God  By the latter half of the 19th century, binitarianism was held by a relatively small group of church denominations. At present, it is a theology essentially held only by some 7th Day Church of God groups. The three largest church denominations that appear to hold a binitarian view today are the General Conference of the Church of God (Seventh Day) with other Church of God (7th Day) groups remaining unitarian; the United Church of God, and the Living Church of God. Other groups, scattered spin-offs from the breakup of the previously sabbatarian Worldwide Church of God founded by Herbert W. Armstrong, also hold to a binitarian view of God. The sabbatarian Churches of God persist in their worship of Jesus and the Father; insisting that, in their worship of the \\"plural\\" God, \\"Elohim\\" (Gods), as multiple separate and individual God-beings of which only the Father and Son are now very God, they are practicing monotheism in the sense that \\"Elohim\\" is one family unit. Adherents of these churches believe they will eventually be born into that family as children of God at a resurrection of the dead at the second coming of Christ. They also believe that others will follow as children of God after Christ rules on Earth and teaches the correct way to live and follow him. These same groups insist certain human beings may eventually be gifted with all the attributes of the Father and Jesus. These humans who may enter the \\"God family\\" are currently only those found to be attending the congregations that openly support \\"pluralism\\", but after Jesus's return salvation shall be offered to all during the Great White Throne Judgment, which is a form of universal reconciliation. God's plural identification in Genesis as \\"Elohim\\", as the Father and the Word or Logos () who became the Son of God, the firstborn of many brethren, leaves room for untold numbers to be added to God's family. This binitarian view posits that humanity eventually will have access to become members of God's family in their own right each with the power of the Holy Spirit, however, not equal to Father or Son. As part of the binitarian view it is also believed that, as the Bible states, the Father is greater than Jesus. Since within the binitarian view the Father is and has always been greater than Christ (the Word or Logos), the doctrine also tends to diminish the centrality of Christ in Scripture and is at variance with the sentiments of , and John 14:6. = Contrast with Trinitarians = Trinitarians sometimes describe the modern binitarian view as \\"ditheist\\" or \\"dualist\\" instead of binitarian because in their misunderstanding of binitarianism some claim it posits that God is multiple beings, analogous to a human family; as all humans are also called \\"Man\\", after their first father, so in the Father's family, all born into his family are called \\"God\\". This is considered a form of polytheism in the traditional trinitarian view as well as in the unitarian or monotheistic point of view. Semi-Arian binitarians do not believe that Jesus \\"was fully human and fully God\\", which is the position held by trinitarians. They believe that Jesus was God (the Word) prior to His incarnation, that He became fully human (finite) yet he was not fully God during the pre-resurrection incarnation as He did not have the powers etc. of God then, and that all authority was restored to Him (as well as his infinite God-status) at or shortly after the resurrection. They make three major claims to support that position: #Semi- Arian binitarians believe that Jesus emptied Himself of His Divinity while in the flesh, citing the same Scriptures which trinitarians cite to the opposite conclusion: that he denied himself the honor and glory he deserved, and hid the fact that he is equal to the Father, in order to serve those who were undeserving. 2 Corinthians 8:9 states that Jesus became poor, yet God is rich (Haggai 2:8), while Philippians 2:7 states, \\"... Christ Jesus, who subsisting in (the) form of God thought (it) not robbery to be equal to God, but emptied Himself, taking (the) form of a slave, becoming in (the) likeness of men\\". The Semi-Arian view of these texts is called kenosis, referring to the idea that what Jesus \\"emptied\\" himself of was his divinity (rather, than, say, his exalted position in Heaven). #They deny the trinitarian teaching that Jesus possessed two wills and two natures. For this reason they view the assertions of Jesus that He \\"could do nothing\\" without the Father, prior to His resurrection (John 5:19,30; 8:28), as a denial by him that he had all divine rights until after the resurrection, when he claimed that he had \\"all authority in heaven and on earth\\" (Matthew 28:18). They conclude that it is because he had overcome the temptations of Satan and upon living the perfect sinless life would be \\"all powerful\\". #Similarly, they note that the Bible claims that Jesus was tempted in all points as humans are (Hebrews 4:15) and that in another place the Bible claims \\"God cannot be tempted by evil\\" (James 1:13). Denying the trinitarian view of two natures, Semi-Arian binitarians see the assertions as contradictory if posited of the same person and therefore, since \\"scripture cannot be broken\\" (John 10:35), Jesus could not have been fully God while in the flesh. But still that is contrary to Colossians 2:9 which says \\"For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\\" and Luke 4:12 \\"And Jesus answered, and said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\\" In other words, Semi-Arian binitarians believe that in the flesh Jesus was not who He was prior to His incarnation (God the Word), not what He was (i.e. not fully God with all authority) since His resurrection. He was God, then he was not fully God, then he was God again. Trinitarians teach that the Holy Spirit is another person like the Son, who comes from God without becoming a separate being from him (Matthew 28:19‚Äì20; John 16:5‚Äì7; Acts 1:8, 2:4). Most binitarians teach that the Holy Spirit is essentially the power of God, with no distinct identity within God, and not a separate Being or Person as they conceive the Son to be. For example, in its Official Statement of Fundamental Beliefs, the binitarian Living Church of God states, \\"The Holy Spirit is the very essence, the mind, life and power of God. It is not a Being. The Spirit is inherent in the Father and the Son, and emanates from Them throughout the entire universe (1 Kings 8:27; Psalm 139:7; Jeremiah 23:24). It was through the Spirit that God created all things (Genesis 1:1‚Äì2; Revelation 4:11). It is the power by which Christ maintains the universe (Hebrews 1:2‚Äì3). It is given to all who repent of their sins and are baptized (Acts 2:38‚Äì39) and is the power (Acts 1:8; 2 Timothy 1:6‚Äì7) by which all believers may be 'overcomers' (Romans 8:37 (KJV); Revelation 2:26‚Äì27) and will be led to eternal life.\\" Scripture mentions prayer to the Father, and to the Son, but the Holy Spirit is never prayed to nor worshiped in the Bible; in the Revelation of John, there is praise to the \\"One who sits upon the throne\\" (God), \\"and to the Lamb\\" (Jesus), but the Spirit is not mentioned; modern binitarians conclude that this is because the Holy Spirit is not a person of the God family, but the mind of God. Binitarians believe that statements from early Christian leaders such as Melito of Sardis and Polycarp of Smyrna were binitarian, though most mainstream scholars do not accept this assertion. Binitarians point out, for example, while both call the Father and Son \\"God\\", not only do neither refer to the Holy Spirit as God, Melito's \\"Oration on Our Lord's Passion\\" suggests that the Holy Spirit is simply the power of God in action. Binitarians have noted that Paul honors the Father and the Son towards the beginning of every book he wrote, but never does so for the Holy Spirit. Trinitarians see Romans 1:4 \\"And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:\\", Ephesians 1:13 \\"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise\\", 1 Thessalonians 1:5‚Äì6 \\"For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost (cor. gk. pneuma, air, breath, breeze, Spirit), and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost (cor. Spirit):\\" and 1 Timothy 1:14 \\"And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\\" as exceptions. By not considering that the Holy Spirit is a person of God, or God's mind, some binitarians were also called the Pneumatomachi, as a subset of Semi-Arians. The Catholic historian Epiphanius described them as \\"A sort of monstrous, half-formed people of two natures.\\" = Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy = Binitarians from groups originating in the old Worldwide Church of God (the current Worldwide Church of God is now trinitarian), believe that the teaching from Romans 8:29 about Jesus being \\"the firstborn among many brethren\\" demonstrates that Christians will be in the Family called \\"God\\". The view that God is a Family that Christians can expect to be born into is not widely held within groups that profess Christianity. However, there is a sense in which trinitarians believe that, by being united with Christ, a Christian becomes a participant in the Son's communion with the Father, they become sons by adoption and brothers to Christ, and \\"sharers in the divine nature\\" (although Eastern Orthodox Christians would have reservations regarding how \\"nature\\" would be interpreted). This contrasting, majority view has been thoroughly developed in the Catholic, Trinitarian tradition inherited by most Protestants. For example, the Trinitarian Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that Christians will by grace become so entirely conformed to the will, purpose, and character of God, that they will be gods by the grace of God, but not on the same level of the Uncreated God. Timothy Ware, an Eastern Orthodox theologian, wrote, \\"St. Athanasius summed up the purpose of the Incarnation by saying, 'God became human that we might be made God'...we are God's 'offspring' (or generation) (Acts xvii, 28), His kin ... we will become 'like' God, we will acquire divine likeness; In the words of John Damascene ... To acquire the likeness is to be deified, it is to become a 'second god', a god by grace'. 'I said, ye are gods, and all of ye children of the Most High' (Psalm lxxxi, 6; cf John x, 34‚Äì35) ... Such, according to the teaching of the Orthodox Church, is the final goal at which every Christian must attain: to become like God, to obtain theosis, 'deification' or 'divinization'. For Orthodoxy human salvation and redemption mean something close to, but not the same as, deification...deification is not something reserved for a select few initiates, but is something intended for all alike, but only in the sense of attainment of heavenly attributes. The Orthodox Church believes this is the normal goal of every Christian without exception. Certainly we shall only be deified on the Last Day; but for each of us the process of divinization must begin here and now in this present life.\\" Western Christians often vigorously avoid the terminology of deification, divinization, or theosis, while not necessarily rejecting the intended doctrine expressed in different terms. Modern binitarians strongly agree with these Eastern Orthodox statements concerning deification, as they understand them. However, in Eastern Orthodoxy, theosis is profoundly linked to a Trinitarian understanding of God, laying special emphasis on the Holy Spirit as containing and communicating the fullness of God, not as an intermediary, but as God indeed. In Eastern Orthodoxy especially, to deny that the Holy Spirit eternally proceeds from the Father alone but rather from both the Father and the Son, as the filioque states, is seen as tending toward binitarian monotheism, or worse, bitheism. The Roman Church accepted and urged adoption of the filioque, which formed the theological rationale for the schism with the Eastern Orthodox in 1054. The Orthodox urge that these filioque statements must be rejected because the theological understanding of the Spirit is directly attached to consequent notions of what the unity of God is, the unity of the gift of God in giving his Son and His Spirit, and thus what \\"salvation\\" means and by what principle it is lived out. In addition, the Orthodox view of theosis only allows humans to be united with God in his \\"energies\\", but never with God's \\"essence\\", as God remains completely transcendent in His essence. Binitarians look forward to their hope of being deified, and deny that the trinitarian or Chalcedonian doctrines uniquely assert anything necessary to a godly faith, along with Mormons. Nevertheless, as they do not see the strict monotheism or the trinitarianism of Eastern Orthodoxy as contributing anything essential and necessary, these binitarians see themselves as closer to the Eastern Orthodox than to \\"theosis\\" as found in Western (Augustinian) Christianity, or the Mormon views of deification, as they understand these doctrines. The Oriental Orthodox position is the same as the Eastern Orthodox position; however, they do not accept the wording of the Chalcedonian Creed.

In 2010, the industrial division of iRobot accumulated $13.2 million in revenue for international orders for PackBot alone in more than 25 countries. In September 2014, iRobot secured a deal with the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND). The contract was for the delivery of PackBot reconnaissance, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear systems. The contract was priced at $9.6 million and includes the training of military personnel to operate the equipment as well as lifetime repairs and technical support. PackBots have also been used in non military operations. In 2014 the Brazilian government received an order of 30 PackBots. The robots were used for security purposes during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the deal totaled $7.2 million in order to police the twelve host cities during the soccer matches. To date, iRobot has delivered upwards of 5000 different robots including PackBots internationally.  NASA and PackBots  The National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) has a partnership with the company, iRobot. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a facility responsible for the development of robotic space-crafts as well as the Deep Space Network. Among these space-crafts are the rovers sent to the planet Mars. The rovers Spirit and Opportunity sent to Mars in 2003 are just two of the rovers managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Mars is not the only place employing iRobot technology. In 2011, Japan was rocked by a strong earthquake causing a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactor. Two PackBot rovers were deployed into the ruins of the nuclear power plant to assess damage where the radioactivity was at high enough levels prohibiting humans from exploring. The projects involving the cooperation of iRobot and NASA allowed the creation of high-tech machines. The much needed physical structure of the robots was designed by iRobot while the instruments and science equipment onboard was provided by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Current PackBot 510 variants  A U.S. Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician trains on iRobot's PCC, one of the remote control operation devices used to operate the Packbot.

The robot can traverse mud, rocks, stairs, and other surfaces due to its caterpillar track. The robot also has zero radius turn capability, and can climb up to a 60 degree incline. The dual BB-2590/U Li-ion rechargeable batteries allow for the robot to have a run time of 4 to 8 hours. Adaptive Materials Inc. (AMI) has created a power pod battery capable of extending the life of the PackBot. The power pod weighs 6 kg(13 lbs) and allows for extension of battery life to reach 12 hours. It can maneuver in up to 3 feet of water. PackBot has more than 40 accessories which are illustrated in PackBot 510 variants. Additionally, the robot can communicate up to 1000 meters or 3281 feet, and captures information through four cameras with night vision, zoom, and illumination capabilities that allow for real time image processing.  Previous PackBot variants  A U.S. Navy Sailor assigned to an explosive ordnance disposal team poses beside a PackBot. * PackBot Scout is the basic configuration. It has five payload bays for assignable purposes and can be dropped from a height of six feet (1.83m) onto concrete without being damaged.

The Fibre Optic cable option is used in situations involving potential radio signal triggered explosive devices, thereby reducing the risk of personal injury.  Packbot Deployment  The main use of the Packbot in the field is IED detection and defusing. The Packbot Scout was the first deployment of the Packbot and sent to Afghanistan in 2002 to explore caves and bunkers. This model was the simplest Packbot which contained just a robotic arm and camera. As of 2007 Packbots have been deployed to aid in the detection of sniper fire in the middle east. Acoustic signatures detected by the robot allow ground troops to pinpoint sniper fire in battle. Packbot has also been used to explore buildings and other possibly dangerous areas with the modified light Packbot Explorer which only weighs 30 pounds and is faster than the Packbot 510. In addition, iRobot sent two Packbot 510 robots to Japan after the tsunami and earthquake destroyed Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The robot was used on several reconnaissance missions at the power plant to remove debris and measure radiation readings.

It was created by Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, the writing partnership most famous for Father Ted, but the scripts were written by Mathews alone. It starred Simon Pegg, Sally Phillips, Julian Rhind-Tutt and Darren Boyd.  Synopsis  Hippies is set in 1969 during the 'Swinging Sixties' and follows the misadventures of Ray Purbbs (Pegg), who is the editor of a counterculture magazine called Mouth (a parody of Oz and International Times), which he produces in his flat in Notting Hill Gate. He is aided by Alex Picton-Dinch (Rhind-Tutt), Hugo Yemp (Boyd) and Jill Sprint (Phillips). Ray is constantly pining for Sprint to no avail. The series delves into late 1960s culture and involves the characters in various socially awkward situations in this setting.  Episodes  Critical reaction The series was Mathews and Linehan's immediate follow up to the hugely popular and highly successful Father Ted. As such it received a significant amount of pre- release hype which viewers felt let down by after watching the first few episodes, as it did not meet their expectations. In general it was badly received by critics but has gained a cult following. A second series was commissioned, but was never written after Mathews was put off by the negative critical reaction. Hippies has never been repeated on any terrestrial BBC channels, although it has been repeated on Paramount Comedy 2, the now defunct Play UK, and Gold. BBC America aired the series in the United States in 2000. The series was released on Region 0 DVD in the UK in March 2008.

Because Detachment 101 was never larger than a few hundred Americans, it relied on support from various tribal groups in Burma. In particular, the vigorously anti-Japanese Kachin people were vital to the unit's success. By the time of its deactivation on July 12, 1945, Detachment 101 had scored impressive results. According to official statistics, with a loss of some 22 Americans, Detachment 101 killed 5,428 Japanese and rescued 574 Allied personnel.\\"Central Intelligence Agency. Behind Japanese Lines in Burma: The Stuff of Intelligence Legend (2001). Retrieved 30 May 2012. 101's efforts opened the way for Stilwell's Chinese forces, Wingate's Raiders, Merrill's Marauders, and the great counter-attack against the Japanese Imperial life-line.\\"Peers, back cover. During most of the unit's existence, it funded and coordinated various resistance groups made up of the Kachin people of northern Burma. The best known resistance force was known as the Kachin Rangers and was under the command of Carl F. Eifler, though often the term Kachin Rangers has been used to describe all Kachin Forces raised during the war by the Americans in Northern Burma.Hogan, David W. Jr. U.S. Army Special Operations in World War II. CMH pub ; 70-42, 1958, ch. 5. In July 1942, twenty OSS men moved in and set up headquarters at Nazira in the northeastern Indian province of Assam. No operations of any significance occurred until the end of 1942. Starting in 1943, small groups or individuals were parachuted behind Japanese lines to remote Kachin villages, followed by a parachute supply drop. The Americans then began to create independent guerrilla groups of the Kachin people, calling in weapons and equipment drops. In December 1943 Stilwell issued a directive that Detachment 101 increase its strength to 3,000 guerillas. They were recruited from within Burma, many of them \\"fierce Kachins\\".Hogan. Once established, the groups undertook a variety of unconventional missions. They ambushed Japanese patrols, rescued downed American pilots, and cleared small landing strips in the jungle. They also screened the advances of larger Allied forces, including Merrill's Marauders.Hogan. Eifler held the rank of Colonel when he was relieved because of serious head injuries, Lt. Col. William R. Peers taking over command. At the end of the war, each Kachin Ranger received the CMA (Citation for Military Assistance) Award.Rangers were given a \\"Certificate of Military Assistance\\" and a medal known as a \\"Citation for Military Assistance.\\" An illustration of an actual certificate and medal presented to a Kachin Ranger may be viewed here. Actually, the medal was the result of a mistake. An OSS officer, reading a radio message that advised him how to reward heroic Kachin action, misinterpreted the abbreviation for \\"comma\\" (\\"CMA\\") as signifying some sort of a medal. Reluctant to leave the Kachins empty handed, the OSS quickly created the medal and presented it to them.Hughes, Les. www.insigne.org/OSS-101.htm.

Pymatuning State Park is the largest state park in Pennsylvania and contains the of Pymatuning Lake, three-quarters of which is in Pennsylvania and one-quarter of which is in Ohio. A three-mile (5 km) causeway extends between Pennsylvania and Ohio near the center of the lake. The lake provides fishing and boating year round. There are two natural areas, Clark Island () and Blackjack () in the park. The park is also home to the University of Pittsburgh's Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology. Like all Pennsylvania state parks, admission to the Pymatuning State Park is free. The northern access for Pymatuning State Park can be reached from U.S. Route 6 and the southern access is reached from U.S. Route 322. Pymatuning State Park was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History =Native Americans= Pymatuning State Park is on land that was once a very large swamp. The first known inhabitants were the Mound Builders. Two of their mounds were flooded over by the creation of Pymatuning Lake. The Lenape were living in the area when European settlers first came to the area. The lake is named for the chief, who lived in the area at the time, Pihmtomink. The Lenape were pushed out of the area by the Seneca tribe a member of the larger Iroquois Confederacy. The Seneca were defeated by General Anthony Wayne's forces during the Northwest Indian War and left the area under the terms of the Treaty of Greenville. This treaty marked the beginning of the white man's domination of the area. =From swamplands to parklands= The first settlers to the area were farmers. Life was not easy for the farmers. The land was very swampy and very difficult to reclaim. Farm animals that wandered off were often lost in the quicksands of the swamp or fell prey to predators like foxes, bears and mountain lions. The swamps were infested with mosquitoes that brought yellow fever to the settlers. Building a dam on the Shenango River was first explored in 1911. A massive flood in 1913 caused $3 million in damage and took several lives. The Pennsylvania General Assembly approved a budget of $1.2 million to build at dam across the Shenango, but Governor John K. Tener slashed the budget to just $100,000. The legislature took action again in 1917. This time approving a $400,000 budget under the condition that the needed land in Ohio be purchased by the private sector. The Pymatuning Land Company was formed and raised the needed funds to purchase the needed Ohio properties. The land was finally acquired in full by 1931 when Governor Gifford Pinchot approved $1.5 million to complete the dam. 7,000 men began work on the dam in 1931, and the project was completed in 1934. The final cost of building the dam was $3,717,739; and the lake now holds of water, covering over a length of with a width of at the widest and of shoreline with a maximum depth of . Pymatuning Lake Carp devouring bread in the Pymatuning Spillway. Spillway observation point noted for watching carp Pymatuning Lake was formed in the 1930s by a dam on the Shenango River. The lake features multiple beaches and camping areas in both Pennsylvania and Ohio. The northeastern part of Pymatuning Lake, east of the spillway and three miles (5 km) south of Linesville, is a protected gameland where colonies of 20,000 Canada geese and many more ducks winter each year. The lake is the result of an earth dam three miles (5 km) north of Jamestown, Pennsylvania, whose outflow forms the Shenango River. A north-south spillway crosses the northern part of the lake, with the gameland on the east side. Along this spillway are a wildlife museum and the Linesville spillway, a site famous as \\"The Place Where the Ducks Walk on the Fishes' Backs\\".Where the Ducks Walk on the Fish. RoadsideAmerica.com. Many people throw bread into the water here, and the resulting density of fish (carp) enables the ducks and other waterfowl to walk on top of the carp to vie for the thrown food. The spillway was renovated in 2007. The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources had planned to prohibit bread as food for the carp and ducks on January 1, 2009, only permitting commercial fish food as part of an effort to clean up the area and increase its wild nature, but subsequently reconsidered. =Boating= Boats on Pymatuning Lake Motorboats up to are permitted on Pymatuning Lake. All boats must have a current registration with any state or a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There are three marinas in the Pennsylvania owned part of the lake.

Continental unions vary from collaborative intergovernmental organizations, to supranational politico-economic unions. Continental unions are a relatively new type of political entity in the history of human government. Throughout most of human history, political organization has been at the local level (i.e. tribal, city state) and in more recent centuries, the sub-regional (\\"regional\\")/sub-continental level (i.e. river system/basin empires, the modern \\"nation-state\\"); however, starting with the advent of better transportation, weapons and communication there was for the first time the ability for a union of member states to organize at the continental level. After the devastation of the First and Second World Wars in the middle of the twentieth century, Europe began to slowly integrate with the founding of the \\"European Community\\", which became a political union covering much of the European continent (27 member states ).Benelux customs and economic reforms greatly foreshadowed those of the EUBenelux social reforms greatly foreshadowed those of the EUBenelux parliamentary reforms greatly foreshadowed those of the EU  Existing continental unions  =African Union= The African Union (AU), at a size of and a population of 1 billion, is by far the largest of the existing continental unions in terms of both land mass and population.Reuters Article referring to the African Union as a \\"Continental Union\\" Reuters It includes all African countries. The African Union was formed as a successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The most important decisions of the AU are made by the Assembly of the African Union, a semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states. The AU's secretariat, the African Union Commission, is based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. During the February 2009 Union meeting headed by former Libyan leader Gaddafi, it was resolved that the African Union Commission would become the African Union Authority. The African Union is made up of both political and administrative bodies. The highest decision-making organ of the African Union is the Assembly, made up of all the heads of state or government of member states of the AU. As of 2017 the Assembly is chaired by Alpha Cond√©. The AU also has a representative body, the Pan-African Parliament, which consists of 265 members elected by the national parliaments of the AU member states. The current president of the Pan African Parliament is Bethel Nnaemeka Amadi. Other political institutions of the AU include the Executive Council, made up of foreign ministers, which prepares decisions for the Assembly; the Permanent Representatives Committee, made up of the ambassadors to Addis Ababa of AU member states; and the Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), a civil society consultative body. =European Union= The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union of 27 member states in Europe. Committed to regional integration, the EU was established by the Treaty of Maastricht on 1 November 1993 upon the foundations of the pre-existing European Economic Community.; A European Parliament has been created, directly elected by citizens of the EU. With almost 500 million citizens, the EU combined generates an estimated 30% share (US$18.4 trillion in 2008) of the nominal gross world product. The EU has developed a single market through a standardised system of laws which apply in all member states, ensuring the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital. It maintains common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. Nineteen member states have adopted a common currency, the euro, constituting the Eurozone. The EU has developed a limited role in foreign policy, having representation at the WTO, G8, G20 and at the UN. It enacts legislation in justice and home affairs, including the abolition of passport controls by an agreement between the member states which form the Schengen Area. =Union of South American Nations= The Union of South American Nations (commonly referred to by its Spanish acronym UNASUR) is an intergovernmental union integrating two existing customs unions: Mercosur and the Andean Community of Nations, as part of a continuing process of South American integration. It is modeled on the European Union,Fox News Report calls the Union of South American Nations the formation of a \\"Continental Union\\" Fox News and includes all of continental South America, except for French Guiana (which is an overseas department of France, and therefore part of the European Union). Panama and Mexico hold observer status. The UNASUR Constitutive Treaty was signed on May 23, 2008, at the Third Summit of Heads of State, held in Bras√≠lia, Brazil. In accordance with the Treaty, the Secretariat is located in Quito, Ecuador and the seat of the planned South American Parliament is to be located in Cochabamba, Bolivia. The headquarters of the planned Bank of the South (BancoSur) were to be located in Caracas, Venezuela but have been delayed for numerous reasons. The South American Defence Council was formed on July 20, 2008, and had its first meeting on March 10, 2009. On May 4, 2010, the Heads of State of the Member States unanimously elected former Argentine President N√©stor Kirchner as the first Secretary General of UNASUR. In early 2019, the majority of South American had left UNASUR and formed a second continental union, the Forum for the Progress and Development of South America (commonly referred to as PROSUR). Similar political entities =Asia Cooperation Dialogue= The Asia Cooperation Dialogue is an intergovernmental organization created on 18 June 2002 to promote Asian cooperation at a continental level and to help integrate separate regional organizations such as the ASEAN, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and the SAARC. =Council of Europe= Although generally not considered a traditional continental union, the council is an intergovernmental organization that spans the majority of states considered \\"European\\". As an intergovernmental organization, the council's focus is on political dialog relating to the upholding of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Europe. =Eurasian Economic Union= The Eurasian Economic Union was founded in January, 2015, consisting of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and observer member Moldova, all of them being previous members of the Soviet Union. The Eurasian Union is a Transcontinental Union as members include states from both Europe and Asia. =Organization of American States= Although generally not considered a traditional continental union, the Organization of American States (OAS) is an intergovernmental organization that spans the majority of states considered within the Americas. As an intergovernmental organization, the OAS's focus is on political dialog relating to the purposes of regional solidarity, peace, and cooperation among the states of the Americas. =Pacific Islands Forum= Although generally not considered a traditional continental union, the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is an intergovernmental organization that spans the majority of independent states and dependent territories within the Pacific Ocean. As an intergovernmental organization, the PIF's focus is on political dialog relating to the enhancement of cooperation and economic and social well-being among states within the Pacific Ocean. = In Canadian usage = In Canadian history and political science, the term \\"Continental Union\\" refers to the idea of creating a union between Canada and the United States, either by forming a new, super-national body in which both countries would become equal members, or by the United States annexing Canada. The ideology which favours Canadian integration with the United States, economically or politically, is known as \\"continentalism\\", the more radical version which favours Canada becoming part of the United States is called \\"annexationism\\". Continentalism has historically been one of three theories of Canadian nationality that predominated in English Canadian thought, the others being pro-British \\"Imperialism\\", and Canadian nationalism.Warner, Frederic, The Idea of Continental Union: Agitation for the Annexation of Canada to the United States, 1849-1893, (University of Kentucky Press, 1960), passsim.Carl Berger, The Sense of Power. Studies in the ideas of Canadian imperialism, 1867-1914, (University of Toronto Press, 1970), passim.

The first recorded text was: Origins and meaning It was suggested by Boyd Smith (1920) that the rhyme may be based on a story of Edward I of England travelling to Gloucester, falling off his horse into a puddle, and refusing to return to the city thereafter. There is a rhyme published in Gamer Gurton's Garland (1810) with a similar form: This variant and the late date of recording suggest that the medieval meaning is unlikely. Two other explanations have been proposed. 1. That Doctor Foster was an emissary of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, who visited Gloucester with instructions that all communion tables should be placed at the east end of the church instead of their post-Reformation or Puritan position in the centre of the chancel: but that he had not been able to reach Deerhurst because the Severn was in flood.Brown, P. (1994), Who was Doctor Foster? Gloucestershire History No. 8. 2.

The historian Paul Johnson has described the speech as \\"without question the most famous maiden speech in history, quite unprecedented, and never equalled since.\\" Smith used his opportunity as a member of the embattled Tory opposition of 1906 to decry and assail the government for their heavy- handedness and arrogance after winning a landslide victory in the general election. After this speech, Tim Healy, the Irish Nationalist, a master of parliamentary invective, sent Smith a note, \\"I am old, and you are young, but you have beaten me at my own game.\\" The speech solidified Smith's reputation as an orator and rising political star, and established him as a major figure within the Conservative Party.

Biography Also known occasionally as Harold McGrath, he was born in Syracuse, New York. As a young man, he worked as a reporter and columnist for the Syracuse Herald newspaper until the late 1890s when he published his first novel, a romance titled Arms and the Woman. According to the New York Times, his next book, The Puppet Crown, was the No.7 bestselling book in the United States for all of 1901. MacGrath subsequently wrote novels for the mass market about love, adventure, mystery, spies, and the like at an average rate of more than one a year. He would have three more of his books that were among the top ten bestselling books of the year. At the same time, he published a number of short stories for major American magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal, and Red Book magazine. Several of MacGrath's novels were serialized in these magazines and contributing to them was something he would continue to do until his death in 1932. In 1912, Harold MacGrath became one of the first nationally known authors to write directly for the movies when he was hired by the American Film Company to do the screenplay for a short film in the Western genre titled The Vengeance That Failed. MacGrath had eighteen of his forty novels and three of his short stories made into films plus he wrote the story for another four movies. Three of his books were also made into Broadway plays. One of the films made from MacGrath's writings was the 1913 serial The Adventures of Kathlyn featuring Kathlyn Williams. While writing the thirteen episodes he simultaneously wrote the book that was published immediately after the December 29, 1913, premiere of the first episode of the serial so as to be in book stores during the screening of the entire thirteen episodes. 300px Among the movies made from MacGrath's short stories was the 1920 Douglas Fairbanks Production Company's feature-length adventure film The Mollycoddle, based on MacGrath's short story with the same title that appeared in The Saturday Evening Post in 1913. Directed by Victor Fleming, it featured Fairbanks, Ruth Renick, and Wallace Beery and was distributed by the newly created company United Artists. It is said that during this same time, a young Boris Karloff, who previously had a few uncredited movie roles, chose his stage name for his first screen credit during 1920 from the MacGrath novel The Drums of Jeopardy, which had also been published by The Saturday Evening Post in January of that year and which featured a Russian mad scientist character named Boris Karlov. The name Boris Karlov was used from MacGrath's book for the 1922 Broadway play, but by 1923 with actor Boris Karloff using the similar-sounding variation, the character for the first film version was renamed Gregor Karlov. Harold MacGrath's success made him a wealthy man and, although he traveled the world extensively, Syracuse, New York, was his home, and it was there during 1912 that he built an English country-style mansion renowned for its landscaped gardens. In an article in the April 23, 1932, issue of The Saturday Evening Post with the title \\"The Short Autobiography of a Deaf Man\\", MacGrath told the public how he had struggled early in life as a result of a hearing impairment. At a time in history when deaf people were typically considered as lacking intellectual acuity, he had concealed this from his employer and others. Harold MacGrath died at his home in Syracuse a few months after the article was published. Funeral Hundreds of people passed by the author's bier as his body lay in state in St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Syracuse, New York, before a 2 p.m. service on November 5, 1932. Rev. Dr. Henry H. Hadley, rector of St. Paul's, officiated at the church service.Associated Press, \\"Hundreds View Bier Of Noted Novelist\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 6 November 1932, Volume 39, page 7.

He worked for The New York Times from 1922 to 1960. In his obituary, the Times called him \\"the theater's most influential reviewer of his time.\\" Atkinson became a Times theater critic in the 1920s and his reviews became very influential. He insisted on leaving the drama desk during World War II to report on the war, he received the Pulitzer Prize in 1947 for his work as the Moscow correspondent for the Times. He returned to the theater beat in the late 1940s, until his retirement in 1960.

He attended Harvard University, where he began writing for the Boston Herald.\\"Atkinson, (Justin) Brooks.\\" The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives. Ed. Kenneth T. Jackson, Karen Markoe, and Arnold Markoe. Vol. 1: 1981-1985. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1998. p22-24. He graduated from Harvard in 1917, and worked at the Springfield Daily News and the Boston Evening Transcript, where he was assistant to the drama critic. In 1922, he became the editor of the New York Times Book Review, and in 1925 the drama critic. Atkinson married Oriana MacIlveen, a writer, in August 1926. On the drama desk, Atkinson quickly became known for his commitment to new kinds of theater--he was one of the first critical admirers of Eugene O'Neill--for his interest in all kinds of drama, including off-Broadway productions. In 1928, he said of the new play The Front Page, \\"No one who has ground his heels in the grime of a police headquarters press room will complain that this argot misrepresents the gentlemen of the press.\\" In 1932 Atkinson dropped the J. from his bi-line and embraced the witty, direct writing style that became his hallmark. His reviews were reputed to have the power to make or break a new stage production: for example, his panning in 1940 of Lawrence Riley's Return Engagement led to that comedy's closure after only eight performances, this despite the fact that Riley's previous comedy, Personal Appearance, had lasted for over 500 performances on Broadway. Atkinson, who was dubbed \\"the conscience of the theater,\\" was not comfortable with the influence he wielded over the Broadway box office. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Atkinson attempted to enlist in the Navy, but was refused. He requested a reassignment to war coverage, and The New York Times sent him to the front lines as a war correspondent in China, where he covered the second Sino- Japanese war until 1945. While in China, he visited Mao Tse-Tung in Yenan and was captivated by Mao, writing favorably on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) movement, and against the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek, which he saw as reactionary and corrupt. After visiting Yenan, he wrote that the CCP political system was best described as an \\"agrarian or peasant democracy, or as a farm labor party.\\"Knightley, Phillip, The First Casualty: The War Correspondent as Hero and Myth-Maker from the Crimea to Iraq, JHU Press (2004), , , p. 303Shewmaker, Kenneth E., Americans and Chinese Communists, 1927-1945: A Persuading Encounter, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press (1971) Atkinson viewed the Chinese Communist Party as Communist in name only and more democratic than totalitarian; the Times effusively titled his article Yenan, a Chinese Wonderland City. After the end of the war, Atkinson stayed only briefly in New York before being sent to Moscow as a press correspondent; his work as the Moscow correspondent for the Times earned him a Pulitzer Prize for Correspondence in 1947. After returning from the Soviet Union, Atkinson was reassigned to the drama desk, where he remained until his retirement in 1960. He is given much credit for the growth of Off-Broadway into a major theatrical force in the 1950s, and has been cited by many influential people in the theatre as crucial to their careers. David Merrick's infamous spoof ad for Subways Are For Sleeping--in which he hired seven ordinary New Yorkers who had the same names as prominent drama critics to praise his musical--had to wait for Atkinson's retirement, because Merrick could not find anyone with the right name. There was only one Brooks Atkinson in New York City. Atkinson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960. He came briefly out of retirement in 1965 to write a favorable review of Man of La Mancha; his review was printed on the first page of the show's original souvenir program. After his retirement, he became a member of The Players who organized a tribute dinner for Atkinson's 80th birthday which was attended by Arthur Miller, Elia Kazan, and other prominent actors and playwrights. He died on January 14, 1984 at Crestwood Hospital in Huntsville, Alabama. Atkinson had moved to Huntsville from his farm in Durham, New York in 1981 to be closer to his family.

The experiment ran from 1999 to 2010. The Belle detector was located at the collision point of the asymmetric-energy electron‚Äìpositron collider, KEKB. Belle at KEKB together with the BaBar experiment at the PEP-II accelerator at SLAC were known as the B-factories as they collided electrons with positrons at the center-of-momentum energy equal to the mass of the (4S) resonance which decays to pairs of B mesons. The Belle detector was a hermetic multilayer particle detector with large solid angle coverage, vertex location with precision on the order of tens of micrometres (provided by a silicon vertex detector), good distinction between pions and kaons in the momenta range from 100 MeV/c to few GeV/c (provided by a Cherenkov detector), and a few-percent precision electromagnetic calorimeter (made of CsI(Tl) scintillating crystals). The Belle II experiment is an upgrade of Belle that was approved in June 2010.KEK press release It is currently being commissioned, and is anticipated to start operation in 2018. Belle II is located at SuperKEKB (an upgraded KEKB accelerator) which is intended to provide a factor 40 larger integrated luminosity.  Results  The retired central drift tracking chamber from Belle, now exhibited at the National Museum of Nature and Science. The experiment was motivated by the search for CP-violation. However the experiment also performed extensive studies of rare decays, searches for exotic particles and precision measurements of the properties of D mesons, and tau particles. The experiment has resulted in almost 300 publications in physics journals. Highlights of the Belle experiment include * an observation of large CP-violation in the neutral B meson system * measurement of the branching fraction of inclusive Bto X_{s}gamma decays * observation of the bto sl^+l^- transition with B to K l^+ l^- and B to K^* l^+ l^- * measurement of phi_3 using the B to D K, D to K_S pi^+ pi^- Dalitz plot * measurement of the CKM quark mixing matrix elements V_{ub} and V_{cb} * observation of direct CP-violation in B^0 to pi^+ pi^- and B^0 to K^- pi^+ * observation of b to d transitions * evidence for B to tau u * observations of a number of new particles including the X(3872)  Data samples  The KEKB accelerator was the world's highest luminosity machine at the time. A large fraction of the data was collected at the (4S). The instantaneous luminosity exceeded . The integrated luminosity collected at the (4S) mass was about (corresponding to 771 million meson pairs). About 10% of the data was recorded below the (4S) resonance in order to study backgrounds. In addition, KEKB carried out special runs at the (5S) resonance to study mesons as well as on the (1S), (2S) and (3S) resonances to search for evidence of Dark Matter and the Higgs Boson. The samples of (1S), (2S) and (5S) collected by Belle are the world largest samples available.

It belongs to the large family of Franco-Belgian comics.  Publishing history  Luc Orient was originally serialized in the weekly Tintin magazine starting on January 17, 1967. It was one of the several series simultaneously launched by then-editor Greg to give the magazine a needed facelift. Luc Orient's adventures were then collected as a series of graphic novels by √âditions du Lombard, starting in 1969. The series continued regularly with one or two volumes per year until episode 13, L'enclume de la foudre was released in 1978. After Tintin ceased publication in 1978 (following several name changes), the later episodes were released sporadically. The series was to be reprinted in an omnibus edition, two volumes in one, by Pictoris Studio, under the title L'int√©grale de Luc Orient; but only three tomes (i.e. the first six volumes) ever appeared, between 1998 and 1999.  Synopsis  Luc Orient, professor Hugo Kala from Eurocristal laboratory and his secretary Lora, share several adventures involving aliens and scientific mysteries. At the beginning, the trio discovers a stranded spaceship with a hibernating alien crew; professor Kala's arrival brings hope to the refugees from the planet Terango (Episodes 1-2). They then travel to Terango to thwart the evil tyrant Sectan who plots to invade Earth (Episodes 3-5). Subsequent adventures involve a series of scientific mysteries. Luc and Lora even acquire temporary superpowers in Episode 6. Bibliography Stories were originally published in several magazines, including Tintin, Tintin Hebdo and Nouveau Tintin.

Located just south of the Allegheny National Forest, the park is a heavily wooded area of rolling hills and mountains along the Clarion River in northwestern Pennsylvania. Cook Forest State Park is known for some of America's finest virgin white pine and hemlock timber stands and was once called the \\"Black Forest\\" due to the preponderance of evergreen tree coverage. Cook Forest is now a National Natural Landmark and was rated one of America's top 50 state parks by National Geographic Traveler magazine. It was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) and its Bureau of Parks as one of \\"25 Must-See Pennsylvania State Parks\\". History When European-Americans reached this part of Pennsylvania it was inhabited by the Seneca Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. They used this area as a hunting grounds; the land of Cook Forest was then purchased by the English. Seneca Rock is still named after the first inhabitants, and the Paramount Pictures' film \\"Unconquered\\" was shot here in 1946 by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Gary Cooper and Paulette Goddard. John Cook was the first permanent American settler. He arrived in 1826 to determine the feasibility of building an east-to-west canal along the Clarion River for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. John purchased and settled here with his wife and 10 children in 1828. At the mouth of Tom's Run, now adjacent to the park office, John built his one-story cabin and the first of many water-driven sawmills. He worked his mills, logged with oxen, rafted logs to Pittsburgh and also engaged in flatboat building through the years. John's son Andrew bought from his father, then gained the rest of his land when his father died in 1858. Andrew's industry expanded, and he built the original Cook Forest Inn for his woodsmen's living quarters. Andrew erected three sawmills, one flouring mill, one planing mill, a boat scaffold, several dwellings and a store. Andrew also served as a judge and local bank president. About 1870, he built the Cook Homestead (now a bed and breakfast) at the intersection of Route 36 and River Road. Cook family descendants still inhabit many of the homes along River Road. After Andrew's death, the business was managed under A. Cook Sons Company. The Forest Cathedral of Cook Forest Major Israel McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was author and steward of Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark, and a founder of the Pennsylvania Conservation Association.‚ÄúThe idea of making this timberland a public park originated with McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, who gave liberally of his time and money to interest others, and presented the cause to the State Legislature in 1911.‚Äù See Forest County Genealogy, History of Cook Forest at http://www.pa- roots.com/forest/history/historyofcookforest.html and http://www.pa- roots.com/forest/history/historyofcookforest.html Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies. Once called the \\"Black Forest\\", the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks. The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated on McCreight's first visit to the \\"Forest Cathedral\\" near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania. \\"It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent ‚Äòtemple of the gods‚Äô, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered. Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment. It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer sat down on a log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them, The writer said to him: ‚ÄòCook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity‚Äôs sake.\\"‚ÄúCook Forest Park Story‚Äù at p.14. McCreight was determined to save the forest and began a campaign to conserve the natural landmark.

For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the Cook Forest Association was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock.McCreight, ‚ÄúCook Forest Park: Story of the Sixteen Year Battle to Save the Last Stand of Historic Penn's Woods: The when, the why and how of it‚Äù (1936)(hereinafter ‚ÄúCook Forest Park Story‚Äù) at p.14.

The Association, endorsed by national natural resource groups and Governor Gifford Pinchot, raised $200,000. Old growth forest in the park On April 14, 1927, a bill was signed by Governor John Stuchell Fisher appropriating $450,000 on condition that the Cook Forest Association raise the remaining $200,000 to purchase the 6,055 acres. On December 28, 1928, the funds having been raised by the Cook Forest Association, the Secretary of the Department of Forests and Waters announced the formal purchase. Money from the Association helped the Commonwealth purchase from A. Cook Sons Company in 1927 for $640,000. Cook Forest became the first Pennsylvania State Park acquired to preserve a natural landmark. Built in 1929, a firetower was used to spot forest fires. It stands over tall. While no longer in use, the public can still climb to the top of the stairs. In addition, on rare occasions, the top spotting area will be opened by a guide to allow visitors a closer look. The Cook Forest State Park Indian Cabin District is a national historic district that includes 11 contributing buildings. They are single room log cabins located on Toms Run behind the park office. They were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps as part of Camp SP-2, which operated in the park from October 1933 to September 1935. Note: This includes These cabins are constructed largely of American chestnut logs which were selected due to both their long-term rot-resistance and the impending local extinction of the species due to chestnut blight. Ecology The park is in the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion. It is famous for its spectacular stands of old-growth Eastern White Pine and Eastern Hemlock, with more white pine over in its Forest Cathedral than in any other site in the northeastern United States. Many of these ancient trees began growing after a drought and fire in 1644. In total, there are some to of old-growth forests or old forests with old-growth characteristics in several stands throughout the park. In addition to white pine and hemlock, old-growth Northern Red Oak, White Oak, Black Cherry, Red Maple, Sugar Maple, American Beech, White Ash, Yellow Birch, Black Birch, Cucumber Magnolia also grow throughout the park. Recreation Cook Forest features 27 marked trails totaling some for hiking. The terrain is of rolling hills and cool valley streams. Special scenic areas are the old growth forest, Fire Tower/Seneca Point and the Clarion River. Among Cook Forest's primary attractions is the \\"Forest Cathedral\\" area of old growth white pine and hemlock, some trees of which top . A somewhat more minor attraction is the short rock \\"grotto\\" found in the midst of the mountain- laurel thickets along Seneca trail roughly halfway between the Fire Tower/Seneca Point area and the end of Deer Park Trail. Part of the Baker Trail () and the North Country National Scenic Trail pass through Cook Forest. The Baker Trail runs from Freeport, in southern Armstrong County, to the Allegheny National Forest. The North Country Trail is under development and will connect the Missouri River in North Dakota with the Adirondack Mountains in New York. Bikes are permitted on all one-way dirt roads within the park. Biking on hiking trails is not permitted except on the part of the Heffern Run Trail that is part of the Bicycle Route. All children under 12 years of age are required to wear a helmet when biking. Bikes ridden at night must have a light on the bike. The Bicycle Route is long and follows lightly traveled roads within the park and Heffern Run Trail. The route is of moderate difficulty with long flat areas and rolling hills. Highlights of the route are a leisurely four-mile flat ride through scenic Tom's Run Valley, CCC-era red and white pine plantations along Forest Drive and a challenging descent along the Heffern Run Trail. A description of the Bicycle Route is available at the park office. The swimming pool is permanently closed due to lack of funds to sustain it. Visitors may swim in the Clarion River across from the ranger station or anywhere along public park land. Many local businesses provide canoeing and tubing along the relatively shallow and slow-moving river. Two designated bridle trails off Cemetery Road and portions of Brown's Run Trail comprise of trails for horseback riding. Several stables dot the area and are open to the public most of the year; these include Silver Stallion, Pine Crest, and the Cook Forest Scenic Trailride, Dude Ranch, and Campground. About are open to hunting, trapping, and the training of dogs during established seasons. Common game species are deer, wild turkey, bear, and squirrel. Hunting woodchucks, also known as groundhogs, is prohibited. Dog training is only permitted from the day following Labor Day to March 31 in designated hunting areas. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Pennsylvania Game Commission rules and regulations apply. Contact the park office for accessible hunting information. The Clarion River flows along the park border and provides fishing for trout, warm-water game fish and panfish. Many visitors enjoy canoeing or kayaking down the river. There are also businesses that will rent visitors a canoe. About of Tom's Run is stocked with trout. A special fishing pond stocked with trout is by the park office and is available for use by children 12 and younger and people with a disability. A level grass bank at the edge of the pond provides easy access. For complete information on fishing rules and regulations in Pennsylvania, visit the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Education Programs for all ages are offered March to December. Through hands-on activities, guided walks and evening programs, participants gain appreciation, understanding and develop a sense of stewardship toward natural and cultural resources. Curriculum-based environmental education programs are available to schools and youth groups. Teacher workshops are available. Group programs must be scheduled in advance by calling the park office. A weekly interpretive schedule is available at the park office. The park has an environmental learning center in the Log Cabin Inn at the Main Picnic Area. The Historical Room displays logging and rafting tools, models and artifacts. The fire tower is always open for climbing during daylight hours, and the booth at its top is occasionally opened by a ranger for exhibition; check at the park office for a schedule. A Red-eyed vireo in its nest at Cook Forest State Park A local, non-profit craft organization housed in the historic sawmill offers traditional crafts on display, a gift shop and classes. Demonstrations and classes on various crafts are presented throughout the summer and fall seasons for children and adults. The Verna Leith Sawmill Theater seats 180 people and presents plays, musicals and other entertainment throughout the summer season. Accommodations The 24 rustic cabins rent from the second Friday in April to late December. All cabins are minimally furnished. Each cabin has beds, mattresses, gas stove, refrigerator, and tables and chairs. Occupants must provide their own bedding, cookware and tableware. Alcoholic beverages and pets are not permitted. There are two cabin areas at Cook Forest. The River Cabins are on a hillside overlooking the Clarion River. Two River Cabins have one room and sleep four people and the other 11 River Cabins have four rooms, a fireplace and sleep six or eight people. The Indian Cabins are along Tom's Run behind the park office. These smaller, one-room cabins sleep four people. Part of Ridge Campground is open year-round. Winter access is not guaranteed. Modern restrooms with showers are available late May through early October. The 226 tent and trailer campsites have a picnic table and fire ring, and six sites are ADA accessible. There is a sanitary dump station and coin-operated laundry facilities.

Founded in 1999, TromaDance was originally held in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, operating concurrently alongside the Sundance Film Festival in order to showcase an independent alternative to Sundance's perceived mainstream offerings. Between 2010 and 2013, the festival had been relocated to various locations throughout New Jersey. Since 2014, TromaDance has relocated to New York City. Overview TromaDance advertises itself as \\"the first and only film festival of the people, for the people, and by the people\\", dedicated to \\"bringing independent art back to the people\\". In direct opposition to Sundance, TromaDance doesn't charge an entry fee for filmmakers to submit their films and doesn't charge admission fees for people to attend the film screenings. Although Troma themselves are notorious for their violent low-budget horror films, TromaDance showcases both shorts and features of varying genres and formats, including comedy, drama, documentary, animation and experimental film, though horror, fantasy and sci-fi usually make up a significant portion of the entries. TromaDance is primarily funded by donations, and the festival's employees and volunteers are entirely unpaid. TromaDance has been sponsored over the years by Filmmaker Magazine, G4, J√§germeister, Kodak, MovieMaker Magazine, PETA, Rue Morgue Magazine, SLUG Magazine, and Stella Artois. Troma also sponsors fan-organized events called TromaPaloozas, music festivals that serve as fundraisers for TromaDance. TromaPaloozas have been held in Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Murfreesboro, and Tulsa. History The idea for TromaDance was developed by Troma president Lloyd Kaufman, who got the idea from South Park co-creator Trey Parker (whose debut film, Cannibal! The Musical, was distributed by Troma). Feeling that Sundance had become too \\"Hollywood\\" by charging high entry fees, showing multimillion-dollar \\"independent\\" movies and practicing an elitist structure and film selection process, Parker urged Kaufman to create his own film festival that was the direct independent opposite of Sundance, one that was completely free and focused on independently produced film that was made without the Hollywood system in order to give first-time filmmakers a chance at getting their work seen. Troma has released five volumes of \\"The Best of TromaDance\\", DVDs of selected shorts each from two years worth of the festival. The press conference for the 2005 festival held in October 2004 featured the introduction of the official TromaDance Theme Song by longtime Troma character Count Smokula. \\"Satellite\\" TromaDance festivals *TromaDance DVD Collections (2002‚Äìpresent) *TromaDance Portland (in Portland, OR) (2004) *Tromanale (in Berlin) (2005 and 2006) *Tromafling (in Edinburgh) (2005) *Tromanale (in Berlin) (2005‚Äì2006) *TromaDance North (in Winnipeg, Manitoba) (2006) *TromaDance New Mexico (in Albuquerque) (2006‚Äìpresent) *TromaDance Indiana (in Franklin, IN) (2007‚Äìpresent) *Tromadance Detroit (2013‚Äìpresent) See also * Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film * Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (aka BiFan, Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival, or PiFan) in South Korea * Calgary Underground Film Festival * Dead by Dawn in Edinburgh, Scotland * European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation in Brussels, Belgium * Fantafestival in Italy * Fantasia International Film Festival in Canada * Fantasporto (aka also known as Fantas), in Porto, Portugal * Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas * Festival de Cine de Sitges (aka Sitges Film Festival) in Spain * International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Tempe, Arizona * London FrightFest Film Festival * Lund International Fantastic Film Festival * New York City Horror Film Festival * Screamfest Horror Film Festival in Hollywood, California * Toronto After Dark Film Festival in Canada References External links * Film festivals in New Jersey Fantasy film festivals Film festivals in Utah Troma Entertainment films 1999 establishments in Utah ","title":"TromaDance"},{"id":"2832610","text":"LinkNYC was announced by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 and will eventually replace the city's network of payphones. A municipal wireless network is a citywide wireless network. This usually works by providing municipal broadband via Wi-Fi to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a wireless mesh network. The typical deployment design uses hundreds of wireless access points deployed outdoors, often on poles. The operator of the network acts as a wireless internet service provider.  Overview  A municipal Wi-Fi antenna in Minneapolis, Minnesota Wireless security cameras on a lamp post deployed by New York City Police Department. They are connected to the municipal NYC Wireless Network (NYCWiN). Municipal wireless networks go far beyond the existing piggybacking opportunities available near public libraries and some coffee shops. The basic premise of carpeting an area with wireless service in urban centers is that it is more economical to the community to provide the service as a utility rather than to have individual households and businesses pay private firms for such a service. Such networks are capable of enhancing city management and public safety, especially when used directly by city employees in the field. They can also be a social service to those who cannot afford private high-speed services. When the network service is free and a small number of clients consume a majority of the available capacity, operating and regulating the network might prove difficult. In 2003, Verge Wireless formed an agreement with Tropos Networks to build a municipal wireless networks in the downtown area of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 10 September 2003 Carlo MacDonald, the founder of Verge Wireless, suggested that it could provide cities a way to improve economic development and developers to build mobile applications that can make use of faster bandwidth. Verge Wireless built networks for Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Los Angeles and other areas. Some applications include wireless security cameras, police mug shot software, and location-based advertising. In 2007, some companies with existing cell sites offered high-speed wireless services where the laptop owner purchased a PC card or adapter based on EV-DO cellular data receivers or WiMAX rather than 802.11b/g. A few high-end laptops at that time featured built-in support for these newer protocols. WiMAX is designed to implement a metropolitan area network (MAN) while 802.11 is designed to implement a wireless local area network (LAN). However, the use of cellular networks is expensive for the consumers, as they are often on limited data plans. In the 2010s larger cities embraced the smart city concept to tackle problems such as traffic congestion, crime, encouraging economic growth, responding to the effects of climate change and improving the delivery of city services. However, by 2018 it has become clear that the private sector could not be relied upon to build up city-wide wireless networks to meet the smart city objectives of municipal governments and public utility providers. Finance The construction of municipal wireless networks is a significant part of their lifetime costs. Usually, a private firm works with local government to construct a network and operate it. Financing is usually shared by both the private firm and the municipal government. Once operational, the service may be free to users via public finance or advertising, or may be a paid service. Among deployed networks, usage as measured by number of distinct users has been shown to be moderate to light. Private firms serving multiple cities sometimes maintain an account for each user, and allow the user a limited amount of mobile service in the cities covered. As of 2007 some Muni WiFi deployments are delayed as the private and public partners negotiate the business model and financing. Corporate city-wide wireless networks Google WiFi is entirely funded by Google. Despite a failed attempt to provide citywide WiFi through a partnership with internet service provider Earthlink in 2007,San Francisco pulls the plug on Google / Earthlink's citywide WiFi... for now August 6, 2007 the company claims that they are working to provide a wireless network for the city of San Francisco, California, although there is no specified completion date. Some other projects that are still in the planning stages have pared back their planned coverage from 100% of a municipal area to only densely commercially zoned areas. One of the most ambitious planned projects is to provide wireless service throughout Silicon Valley, but the winner of the bid seems ready to request that the 40 cities involved help cover more of the cost, which has raised concerns that the project will ultimately be too slow to market to be a success. Advances in technology in 2005‚Äì2007 may allow wireless community network projects to offer a viable alternative. Such projects have an advantage in that, as they do not have to negotiate with government entities, they have no contractual obligations for coverage. A promising example is Meraki's demonstration in San Francisco, which already claims 20,000 distinct users as of October 2007.

For the past five years the network attracts some 8,000 daily users as the networks popularity continues to grow despite the proliferation of 4G technology. Criticism and externalities A volunteer installing a \\"supernode\\" of guifi.net. In July 2018 guifi.net had over 35,000 active nodes and about 63,000 km of wireless links. Municipal wireless networks face opposition from telecommunications providers, particularly in the United States, South Africa, India and the European Union. In the 2000s telecommunications providers argued that it is neither economical nor legal for municipal governments to own or operate such businesses. The dominant type of wireless networks are the private wireless local area networks (WLANs), for which individuals or businesses pay a subscription to a local carrier. In 2006 the US Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns about such private-public partnerships as trending towards a franchise monopoly.Should Municipalities Provide Wireless Internet Service? FTC Staff Report Provides Guidance to Promote Competition 10 October 2006 Within the United States, providing a municipal wireless network was not recognized as a priority. Some have argued that the benefits of public approach may exceed the costs, similar to cable television. In the early 2010s concerns were articulated that a considerable percentage of the world population did not have access to affordable Internet access. Despite the growing digitalization of business and government services, 37 percent of the European and 22 percent of the north American population did not have affordable access to the Internet in 2009. Because local governments and municipalities in rural economiess either could not fund wireless networks or did not consider it a priority, numerous communities across the world have built and funded autonomous community wireless networks (CWNs), taking advantage of the free 2.4 GHz spectrum and open source software. The former New York state politician and lobbyist Thomas M. Reynolds argues that unintended externalities are possible as a result of local governments providing Internet service to their constituents. A private service provider could choose to offer limited or no service to a region if that region's largest city opted to provide free Internet service, thus eliminating the potential customer base. The private sector receives no money from taxpayers, so there isn't competition. The lack of competition prevents other municipalities in that region from benefiting from the services of the private provider. The smaller public municipalities would at the same time not benefit from the free service provided by the larger city because it is designed to be subsidized by taxpayers and not concerned about the maximization of profits. The broadband provided by the government isn't largely supported to create an income on top of the private sector not being competed with enough to make a profit. Thus, making both municipal wireless networks anticompetitive.

Origin  The rhyme was first recorded in print by James Orchard Halliwell in 1842: :There was a crooked man, and he went a crooked mile, :He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile; :He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse, :And they all liv'd together in a little crooked house. It gained popularity in the early twentieth century.I. Opie and P. Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 340. One legend suggests that this nursery rhyme originated in the once prosperous wool merchant‚Äôs village of Lavenham, about 70 miles northeast of London, having been inspired by its multicolored half-timbered houses leaning at irregular angles as if they are supporting each other. Other sources state that the poem originates from British history, specifically the period of the Scottish Stuart King Charles I of England (1600‚Äì1649). The crooked man is reputed to be the Scottish General Sir Alexander Leslie, who signed a covenant securing religious and political freedom for Scotland. The \\"crooked stile\\" in the poem was the alliance between the parliaments of England and Scotland or the border between the two, depending on the source. \\"They all lived together in a little crooked house\\" refers to the fact that the English and Scots had at last come to an agreement, despite the continuing great animosity between the two peoples, who nonetheless had to live with each other due to their common border.Here Comes A Chopper to Chop Off Your Head - The Dark Side of ChildhoodThe Secret History of Nursery Rhymes Page 43 The great recoinage around 1696 led to sixpence coins that were made of very thin silver and were easily bent, becoming \\"crooked\\".The British Almanac, 1856, page 17  Related writing  ‚ÄîAnd He Built a Crooked House‚Äî is a science fiction short story by American writer, Robert A.

Biography Calomarde was born in Villel, Aragon, to poor parents. He studied law in Zaragoza, and secured through the promise of marriage with the ugly niece of the royal personal physician Berga a prestigious position in the ministry of law; upon acquiring the position, he backtracked on his promise of marriage, as a result of which he had to be cajoled into it by the King's prime minister, under the threat of being sent to the galleys. He thereafter became an influential royalist in the most conservative circles of the royal court. In 1808, Calomarde followed the central junta of Aranjuez, the leader of which he had become, to Seville and C√°diz; however after the return of Ferdinand VII he was the first to acclaim the absolute monarch, for which he was named first administrator at the Secretaria general de Indias. Due to the fraudulent sale of an American diocese, he was banished to Toledo and, after his secret return to Madrid, to Pamplona. After the restitution of the constitution in 1820, he joined the liberals, true to his flawed character, but only gained renewed influence after the abolishment of the constitution in 1823. He became secretary of the regency based in Madrid, and thereafter, as a willing tool of the reactionaries, he was named secretary of the Camara del real patronato, and finally, 1824, Secretary of Justice. For eight years now the most important matters of the state passed through his hands, and the protection of the weak king secured him unfettered power, which he used to suppress freedom through the secret police, to retrain the Jesuits, restitute the monasteries and ruthlessly prosecute the Liberals. At the same time, he tried to secure the favors of Don Carlos, while he punished the Carlist uprising with great severity. When in September 1832, Ferdinand VII was struck by such a severe stroke of gout that he was presumed dead, Calomarde was the first to greet Carlos as king. When the king recovered, Calomarde tried to persuade him to revoke his decrees and last will and testament, where the princess Isabel was named regent of the country, and to reinstate the Salic law. The king however, on his unexpected convalescence, declared the change of testament on 31 December 1832 for void. Calomarde was banished to his estates in Aragon, and his arrested ordered, but escaped disguised to France, where he died in Toulouse.

He was ordained a minister in North Amherst, Massachusetts on October 16, 1859. He received the honorary DD degree from Harvard University (1857) and two honorary LL.D. degrees from Amherst (1871) and Harvard (1886). He died in Amherst on November 19, 1897. He edited many Greek and Latin texts, and was the author of History of Amherst College During Its First Half Century (1872) and History of Amherst College during the Administration of its First Five Presidents (1894). In the latter he claimed that Amherst was the first U.S. college to use Latin honors, although it appears that Harvard deserves that distinction.

D√©gustation is more likely to involve sampling small portions of all of a chef's signature dishes in one sitting. Usually consisting of eight or more courses, it may be accompanied by a matching wine degustation which complements each dish. History and etymology The French term d√©gustation is still commonly used in English- language contexts. Modern d√©gustation probably comes from the French kitchens of the early 20th century and is different from earlier meals with many courses because these meals were served as full-sized meals at each course. Examples Sampling a selection of cheeses, at home or in a restaurant, may also be called a d√©gustation. Three to four varieties are normally chosen, generally including a semi-soft cheese, a goat's cheese, and a blue cheese. The stronger varieties are normally tasted last. A six course d√©gustation may include two seafood, red meat and dessert items with matching wines while the same menu could have added a vegetarian item, and any other types of dish to expand the menu to (for example) a nine-course d√©gustation menu. The popular Spanish style of tapas is similar to the d√©gustation style, but is not in itself a complete set menu offering the chefs' signature dishes, but instead offers a variety from which the diner can choose.

The episode was the second episode for the show's second season. The episode was written by Chris Black and Alexandra Cunningham and was directed by David Grossman. It originally aired on Sunday October 2, 2005. Plot Susan is dismayed to see her ex-husband, Karl, emerge from Edie's house one morning. She runs over to confront him and he admits he's sleeping with Edie and may move in with her. When Edie comes by‚Äîon rollerskates‚Äîto apologize for not telling her, Susan pretends not to care and gets in her car to drive away. Edie brags that Karl told her that sex with her was the best of his life. Susan snaps back that Karl told her he's still in love with her and recently asked her to come back to him. She drives off, Edie still in pursuit, and after their ensuing argument, accidentally backs up into her. Meanwhile, Mike wants to know where their relationship stands now that they're not moving in together. Susan says she wants to keep it \\"casual,\\" but he doesn't know what that means. \\"We can still go see a movie,\\" she explains, as he comes closer. \\"Anything else?\\" he asks and as he starts to kiss her, she says, \\"Brunch. We can go to brunch!\\" and runs away. Rex's mother Phyllis publicly embarrasses Bree when she starts crying over Rex's death. So Bree slaps her. She apologizes later, but with Bree's uncanny composure and her eagerness to settle Rex's will, Phyllis starts to suspect Bree isn't sorry Rex is dead. The doctor treating Rex finds the note he wrote before he died, forgiving Bree, although it doesn't say why. The suspicious doctor hands it to the lead insurance investigator. The same investigator Phyllis calls when she sees Bree being comforted by the ever opportunistic George. Gabrielle's outburst last time she visited Carlos - about him being a rich man - means unless he pays a violent inmate off, there'll be hell to pay. She agrees to deliver $7,000 to the guy's girlfriend, but it's for breast implants she doesn't want. Gabrielle quickly agrees she doesn't need them and takes the cash back. The next time she sees Carlos, he's been badly beaten and he orders her to convince the girlfriend to take the money. She refuses, unless he gives her control of their bank account. Lynette is dismayed to come back from a long day at the office to find the house is a pigsty and Tom already in bed. The final straw is when she realizes he didn't change the bed after the baby threw up in it. She starts changing the bed around him and he tells her she has control issues. She leaves him the bed and goes to sleep on the couch. While flipping channels she comes across a horror film about rats and has a brainstorm. The next day she lets loose a rat in the house and waits for it to have the desired effect. When she comes home, the house is spotless. Tom admits he let the house go too far but that the rat inspired him to clean. And that he killed it with a shovel. She's both pleased and horrified by the news. She goes to take out the trash and apologizes to the dead rat, but also thanks it for saving her marriage. Susan asks Betty about the strange clanging noises she's been hearing coming from her house in the middle of the night. Betty pretends not to know what she's talking about but then the noise comes again. She explains that it's just her son, Matthew, but then he walks up behind them, having just gotten home. Betty says a quick goodbye, leaving Susan more suspicious than ever. Betty complains to her psychiatrist that she can't sleep, telling him how her husband used to beat her and how she still has nightmares because she wasn't able to prevent him from killing their son. The doctor prescribes a sleeping pill, which she grinds up and puts in the food she brings to the chain-rattling captive in her basement.

He is a graduate of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and his work covers the Roswell and Aztec UFO sightings, the Bible code, global warming, the 9/11 Truth movement and chemtrails. Many of Thomas' articles have been published in Skeptical Inquirer magazine.  Education and awards  Thomas is a graduate of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics and a master's degree in Mathematics. He is a recipient of the Brown Award, New Mexico Tech's highest award to an undergraduate, and the Langmuir Award, given for the most significant publication all rewarding ten years of outstanding interdisciplinary research in chemistry and physics. Thomas also received the National Center for Science Education's Friend of Darwin Award and served as president of the New Mexico Academy of Science and the Coalition for Excellence on Science and Math Education (CESE).  Professional career  When asked about his current work, Thomas wrote, \\"For my 'day job,' I write website scripts that allow seismic scientists to request instrument loans, and permit IRIS/PASSCAL staff to view, manage and update these requests, all over any convenient web portal. Also, I give talks on seismology to visiting groups of students, teachers, or tour- goers.The high point of those talks is my visual explanation of how the little squiggles we measure allow scientists to 'see' underground.\\" \\"I also teach a night class on Science, Pseudoscience and Critical Thinking at New Mexico Tech. There are about sixy students per semester, plus a summer session too. A real romp through the fields of skepticism; Richard Feynman, Amazing Randi, Martin Gardner, Carl Sagan, Isaac Asimov, and Susan Blackmore et. al. are frequently mentioned.\\" In 1976 Thomas filed US Patent 4,116,540 for the Non- Perverting Mirror.  Skepticism  Thomas has published much on the Roswell UFO sightings, and laughing says: \\"My theory...is that the Roswell ship did not actually crash, that it only landed and took off again and continued to land at all these other sites.\\" He has also tackled the Aztec, New Mexico UFO sighting: \\"David Thomas...found exactly that story was spun by a con man named Silas Newton and an accomplice, who fabricated a UFO crash hoax as part of a scam.\\" \\"...the citizens of Aztec, who began their own annual convention celebrating the UFO. For the first few years, Thomas was asked to speak, but the invitations dried up after he explained the hoax: ‚ÄúSince then they really don‚Äôt want to hear what I have to say,‚Äù he notes wryly.\\" In 2009 he was on the faculty of UFOcon at Tucson, Arizona, in which he gave presentations on the Roswell and the Aztec/Socorro incidents. A good idea of Thomas's thinking (and his sense of humour) can be got from his IRIS PASSCAL signature: \\"Those of you who believe in telekinesis, raise my hand.\\" - Kurt Vonnegut and also from his outreach. This paraphrases Kurt Vonnegut: \\"Those who believe in telekinetics, raise my hand.\\" This quote has been misattributed to James Randi.Wikiquote:James Randi In 2004 he presented on \\"The Opposing View: Ten Top Reasons Why ID Should not be Taught in the Science Classroom\\" for the Intelligent Design Network at the Darwin, Design and Democracy V symposium.

More of this is collected together in 'The Bible Code'. In a comment on Michael Drosnin's book: The Bible Code, Ralph Greenberg writes: \\"The control experiments which several people performed show rather clearly the silliness of Drosnin's approach. In Drosnin's book itself, Dave Thomas found the following message encoded as ELS's [Equidistant Letter Sequences]: \\"The code is a silly snake-oil hoax.\\" = Climate change = Thomas together with scientist Kim Johnson talks about climate change and that it is happening today and that solutions need to be found and acted upon. This was aired on the 94 Rock Morning Show in February 2014. Hal Harris reviews in Chem Ed Change: \\"Since most chemistry teachers are not experts on climate change, they usually do not have convincing, understandable, and science-based responses...However, many will also [find] this May/June issue of Skeptical Inquirer useful, because it includes a short article on pages 5-6, \\"Battle of the Op-Eds: Scientists Defend Reality of Climate Change\\" containing [content] written by Dave Thomas...\\" but in 'The Irrelevance of Climate Skeptics' the content becomes a 'one-liner'. In The Albuquerque Journal in 2103 Thomas and 17 members and officers of New Mexicans for Science and Reason co-signed a column: 'Writer Wrong On Climate Change'. In Skeptical Inquirer in 2014 Thomas tries to dispel the confusion between the words 'skeptic' and 'denier'. = The 9/11 Truth Movement = Left to right: Ted Goertzel, Dave Thomas, Bob Blaskiewicz and Scott Lilienfeld at the CSICon 2011 conspiracy theories panel.

Daniel Mays, Claire Skinner and Robert Glenister also appear in supporting roles. The series attracted respectable viewing figures, with 6.92 and 5.73 million viewers tuning in for each respective episode. Despite good critical reception, no further episodes were produced.

Starring Robert Carlyle as Detective Inspector Tom Monroe, Class of '76 starts off in a promising fashion, with its evocative, eerie depiction of a man committing suicide. But the story continues on in a dreary, sombre tone, with little surprises left as the clich√©s start to pile up, leading to the obvious finale. Pat Fisher (Stephen Mapes), tormented and guilty about the death of a fellow classmate back in 1976, as well as terrified by what he sees as a pattern of suspicious deaths for his other childhood friends, deliberately runs onto a busy highway and commits suicide by standing in front of a speeding truck. Leaving behind a tape recording of his paranoid ramblings, Fisher's death is written off as a simple suicide by a disturbed mind. Certainly Monroe's superior DS Pritchard (Tony Haygarth), as well as Tom's partner, Steven Grant (Daniel Mays) believe it to be an open and shut case, not worthy of further investigation. However, something about Fisher's tape, as well as some disturbing memorabilia about several crimes years ago, begin to nag at Monroe, who starts to believe that there may be a pattern to these random deaths. Chief among the evidence that convinces Monroe to continue to dig is Fisher's elementary school class photo that has been marked, indicating three of the children dead. As well, a shadowy, nondescript image of a child has been marked, \\"Who was he?\\" On Fisher's confessional tape, he indicates that there were only 32 students in his class, not the 33 that are in the photo. Contacting fellow student Colin Somerville (Sean Gallagher), Monroe learns from the frightened man that he has been tormented over the years by a voice over the phone that says he will be the next to die. Somerville believes as well that the \\"accidental\\" deaths of the three students were no accidents, and that Aiden Thompson (Kevin French), a boy who remaining classmates describe as \\"different,\\" is the killer. After all, Thompson had confessed to Colin that he had murdered the first victim on the list. However, after Colin nearly dies from a hit-and-run attempt, he tries to convince Monroe that perhaps the shadowy, ghostly figure in the class photo is the real murderer. To tell any more of the plot, or discuss other characters of Class of '76, would be to spoil it for potential viewers, but really, it wasn't very difficult to figure out the end of this promising, but ultimately predictable thriller. While certainly there was an effort to flesh out the clich√©d depiction of the emotionally spent police inspector Monroe, too much of the film consists of shots of Monroe, staring off into space, looking tortured and worried, while ominous music wells up in the background. Meanwhile, the viewer just wants to get on with it all, particularly after one becomes aware of the fact that nothing much new will happen. Carlyle, a ferociously talented Scottish actor, does a too-good job of underplaying the haunted Monroe. Compelling clues are thrown out about Monroe's background, but ultimately, little is finally known about Monroe simply because the filmmakers keep too much hidden, too much suggested but not explored, for us to care.\\" Cast * Robert Carlyle ‚Äî DI Tom Monroe * Daniel Mays ‚Äî DS Steven Grant * Claire Skinner ‚Äî Dr. Kate Tremaine * Robert Glenister ‚Äî Frank Thompson * Sean Gallagher ‚Äî Colin Somerville * Tony Haygarth ‚Äî DS Pritchard * Anton Lesser ‚Äî Martin Gibson * Amelia Curtis ‚Äî Monica Grant * Kevin French ‚Äî Aiden Thompson * Belle Mary Hithersay ‚Äî Alison Carter * William Ilkley ‚Äî Charlie Drain * Pip Torrens ‚Äî Superintendent Flood Episodes References External links * British television films British films ITV television dramas 2005 television films 2005 films 2000s British drama television series 2005 British television series debuts 2005 British television series endings Television series by ITV Studios ","title":"Class of '76"},{"id":"2832655","text":"Clear Creek State Park is a Pennsylvania state park in Barnett and Heath Townships, Jefferson County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Public campsites were first opened at the park in 1922. Many of the facilities seen today at the park were constructed during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Clear Creek State Park is from Brookville on Pennsylvania Route 949 at the confluence of Clear Creek and the Clarion River. Recreation Clear Creek State Park is open to many recreational opportunities. There are of hiking trails that run through the park and into Clear Creek State Forest. One such trail leads to Bear Town Rocks, a group of large boulders in the middle of the forest, from the top of which one can get a scenic view of the surrounding area. The park has extensive picnic facilities and is open to hunting and fishing and serves as a launch point for canoeing on the Clarion River. About of Clear Creek State Park are open to hunting. Hunters may park at the park to gain access to the surrounding Kitanning State Forest. Common game species are white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey, and squirrels. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. All hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. Clear Creek has a native and stocked population of brook trout. The Clarion River also has some trout, panfish and smallmouth bass. Some of the small tributaries of Clear Creek and the Clarion River are also stocked with trout by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.

He was also one of the first Russian science fiction authors. Scientific research Vladimir Obruchev graduated from the Petersburg Mining Institute in 1886. His early work involved the study of gold-mining, which led him to come up with a theory explaining the origin of gold deposits in Siberia. He also gave advice on construction of the Central Asian and Trans-Siberian Railways and consulted Sven Hedin on his projected journey to Siberia. While working for the railway, Obruchev explored the Karakum Desert, the shores of the Amu Darya River, and the old riverbeds of the Uzbois.Plutonia A Word about the author. p. 404. Translated by Fainna Solasko. Raduga Publishers. Moscow. 1988. 2d printing. He also worked as a geologist on Lake Baikal, on the Lena River, and in gold fields near the Vitim. Between 1892 and 1894, Obruchev \\"was a member of the Grigory Potanin's expedition into ... Mongolia, [and] to the mountains of Nan Shan and Northern China.\\" He also explored the Transbaikal area, Dzhungaria, and Altai. Largely as a result of his participation in this expedition he became interested in loess and made considerable contributions to the study of loess deposits.Smalley, I., Markovic.S.B. 2017. Four loess pioneers: Charles Lyell, F.von Richthofen, V.A.Obruchev, L.S.Berg. Quaternary International http://dx.doi/10.1016.J.quaint.2016.07.031 In 1929, Obruchev was elected to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Having spent half a century in exploring Siberia and Inner Asia, Obruchev summarized his findings with a three-volume monograph, The Geology of Siberia (1935‚Äì1938), followed by The History of Geological Exploration of Siberia. Many of his works deal with the origins of loess in Central Asia and Siberia, ice formation and permafrost in Siberia, problems of Siberian tectonics, and Siberian goldfields. He also authored many popular scientific works, such as Formation of Mountains and Ore Deposits (1932), Fundamentals of Geology (1944), Field Geology (1927), Ore Deposits (1928‚Äì1929), and others. All together, Obruchev authored > over a thousand scientific works, among which are a most extensive > geological study of Siberia and a five-volume history of the geological > exploration of Siberia, which have been awarded the Lenin Prize as well as > the prizes and medals of several scientific societies. During 1954, he completed an extensive geographical study of Nan Shan Mountains in China based on his own and previous expeditions to the region and spent his last years working up a geological study of the mountains. Popular fiction Plutonia (–ü–ª—É—Ç–æ–Ω–∏—è, 1915) In his native country Obruchev is best known as the author of two perennially popular science fiction novels, Plutonia (–ü–ª—É—Ç–æ–Ω–∏—è, 1915) and Sannikov Land (–ó–µ–º–ª—è –°–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞, 1924). Both of these stories, imitating the pattern of Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, depict in vivid detail the discovery of an isolated world of prehistoric animals in hitherto unexplored large islands north of Alaska or Siberia. In Plutonia, dinosaurs and other Jurassic species are found in a fictional underground area north of Alaska. The descriptive passages are made more credible by Obruchev's extensive knowledge of paleontology. \\"Sannikov Land\\" is named for a phantom island of the Arctic Ocean, reported historically by Yakov Sannikov in 1811. Paul J. McAuley praised the novel in a 1999 column, saying \\"It's true that the characters are indistinguishably wooden mouthpieces for the author's opinions, and the plot is pure pulp, but all this is redeemed by the novel's rigorous scientific sensibility.\\"Curiosities, F&SF;, February 2000 During the Soviet period, Obruchev attempted to emulate Edwardian models of boys' adventure stories in his novels Golddiggers in the Desert (1928) and In the Wilds of Central Asia (1951).

John Joseph (Jo Jo) McCann (Carlyle) has been a habitual criminal since childhood, when he pilfered cash boxes for his dad. He's been in and out of prison ever since. He lives in a high rise council flat with his mother and sister. It is set in and around the North Sighthill housing estate. Looking After JoJo traces the career of a petty thief turned drug dealer in 1980's Edinburgh. The title character is a pleasant if misguided young man surviving in a bleak housing estate and aspiring to the trappings of a successful criminal. Unfortunately for him, and for most of the other characters in the mini-series, it is a time of heroin addiction and AIDS. We watch JoJo become ensnared in the drugs scene and his deterioration is both painful to watch and very moving. Robert Carlyle's performance is extraordinarily complex and textured. He is ably supported by Jenny McCrindle, Ewan Stewart and Trainspotting's Kevin McKidd. This isn't the fast-moving MTV drug scene of Trainspotting but a more character-oriented, leisurely look at the human cost of drug addiction. Cast and characters * Robert Carlyle as John Joe \\"Jo Jo\\" McCann; a petty thief turned drug dealer. Jo Jo is troubled by memories of his past, in particular his father's death. * Kevin McKidd as Basil; One of Jo Jo's crew, who experiments early on with Heroin and leads the group to its sales. * Jenny McCrindle as Lorraine; Jo Jo's love interest, and a Marilyn Monroe lookalike. Episodes * Episode 1: Steal the Herd In 1982 Jo Jo McCann always manages to stay one step ahead of the police. Family loyalties are tested to the limit by his determination to set up a crime empire in opposition to his uncle, the local underworld kingpin who has a few ruthless ideas of his own. With Ewan Stewart, Jenny McCrindle, Kevin McKidd and Ellie Haddington * Episode 2: Working Week The attraction of making big money dealing heroin proves too much for recently acquitted Jo Jo, who jumps on the bandwagon at the first opportunity. But evil undercurrents of violence and addiction soon surface as he becomes consumed by Edinburgh's drug culture, prompting him to think carefully about his future. Hard-hitting crime drama. * Episode 3: Sinking the Belgrano It is 1983 Money begins to roll in at long last as Jo Jo's heroin business takes off in earnest. But what he doesn't take into account, is that his dodgy dealings are about to destroy everything he loves * Episode 4: When Love Goes Wrong The walls of Jo Jo's world come tumbling down as he finally uncovers the truth about his father's death. Meanwhile, the community spirit of the estate collapses under the pressure of Sarah's imprisonment, Charlie McCann's murder and a rampant Aids epidemic.

TOC  Role-playing Game  The role-playing game was written by Warren Banks and Toren Atkinson, with contributions from John Scott Tynes, Monte Cook, and Andrew J Lucas. It was published by Green Ronin Publishing in 2002. The game is a spoof and homage to 1950s and 1960s science fiction adventure television, such as Lost in Space. The game won the 2003 ENnie silver award for Best Non-Open-Gaming Product. = Game mechanics = The game mechanics are heavily rooted in the Basic Role-Playing system, including a rules system is percentile-based. But creator Toren Atkinson noted the mechanic is based \\"on an old homemade game system of mine from the 80‚Äôs\\". The dice mechanic when performing skills is to roll as high as possible without going over your skill value. The system also brings in the concept of zero dice, which act similar to hero/fate/drama points from other Role-playing game systems. = Setting = The following quote is an accurate summation of the setting. :\\"The year is 2025. Earth spacecraft routinely crisscross the solar system, but leaving its confines has remained impossible until now. A scientist in the employ of SpaceCorp, a firm recently in dire financial straits, has invented the Better-Than-Light (BTL) Drive. If successful, it will usher mankind into an age of interstellar travel and SpaceCorp back into the black. The drive will be tested on a spacecraft designated Spaceship Zero, a Space Hopper Mark V stripped of weapons to accommodate the BTL Drive and the generator for the Bendall Field that protects the craft from the extreme gravity the BTL Drive creates. Presumably, most or all of the PCs are members of the Zero's crew. :\\"Regrettably, when the BTL drive is activated, it doesn't move the Zero at better-than-light speeds as advertised. Instead, it gives the ship infinite mass, creating a gravity well that destroys the entire universe and making the ship ground zero (pardon the pun) for a new Big Bang. :\\"Once the crew is through freaking out, they decide to use the Deconstitutor ‚Äì the setting's equivalent of hypersleep, which works by reducing people into their essential salts (sound familiar, Lovecraft fans?) for storage ‚Äì and wait for the new universe to re-evolve into what should, theoretically, be a carbon copy of the original. :\\"Well, like the BTL Drive, it was a nice theory.\\" Thirteen billion years later the crew is reconstituted, they hope that Universe 2 has evolved in exactly the same way that the Universe 1 they destroyed had. It mostly did, except for a few small differences, most notably a race of alien conquerors ravaging the solar system. There are also a large number of Lovecraft and Cthulhu references throughout the setting and game manual. = Supplements = There are currently three published adventures for the Spaceship Zero roleplaying game. All are written by at least Toren Atkinson with others credited as noted. All follow an ongoing linear story arc. The titles of the three adventures are: *Asteroid X (Toren Atkinson, Evan Sass, Rick Achberger, Matt Wiseman) Adventure Maps *Slave Ship of Despair. (Toren Atkinson, Warren Banks, Andrew J. Lucas, and Brian \\"Chainsaw\\" Campbell) *The Strange Secret of Dr. Quisling. Inspired by a concept by Bob Wilkins  CD  An album by The Darkest of the Hillside Thickets was released a year before the role-playing game hit retail shelves. The original intention was to have both RPG and CD release within a similar timeframe, but the logistics of writing both an album and a role-playing game, trying to coincide their releases, proved to be problematic. The band was touring Canada, promoting the Spaceship Zero album while they were finishing up the final drafts of the role-playing game manuscript. The CD liner notes include a short story about Spaceship Zero and the crew.  Radio Play  In 2016, several \\"restored\\" episodes of the 1954 American radio dramas were released to the internet. Episodes include \\"Chapter One: The Crew Assembles,\\" \\"Chapter Two: Into the Beyond,\\" \\"Chapter Three: The Cataclysmic Miscalculation,\\" \\"Chapter Four: Directive Beta Five,\\" \\"Chapter Six: Escape From the Hydronauts,\\" and \\"Chapter Nine: Twenty Minutes of Oxygen.\\" The missing episodes were allegedly lost in a studio fire in 1962.  Comic Book  A short Spaceship Zero comic book story appeared in the graphic novel anthology Exploded View by Vancouver's Cloudscape Comics in 2010. It is based on the ongoing series of adventures already released (Asteroid X, Slave Ship of Despair, and The Strange Secret of Dr. Quisling) and is intended to be a prequel to that story arc. .  Video  In summer 2010 the band filmed footage using a space suit and various props on location in the sand dunes of Richmond BC and a space ship set left over from the TV show Defying Gravity. The footage was cut into a video for their song \\"20 Minutes of Oxygen\\" and as a trailer for the film, and premiered at the event Cthulhupalooza II: Son of Cthulhupalooza in February 2011 in Vancouver.  Marketing  To enhance the ideas of the setting, the developers have based the game on a number of false documents, namely by referencing the game to television shows, radio plays, and films which did not and do not exist. As the book explains, the game is based on a 1950s German radio play (Raumschiff Null being a direct translation of \\"Spaceship Zero\\"). The German radio play was based on a 1930s American moviehouse serial called Spaceship to the Stars (which eventually became an American television show in the 1950s). The German radio play eventually spawned a German television show (of the same name) that aired from 1978 to 1980. And all this has spawned an American film production. The game plays off the ruse in a variety of ways. For instance, a section of the book is devoted to episode summaries from the \\"old television series\\". And fake websites, hosted by the games' authors, detail the film's production. The marketing of the CD is similar - being referred to and played-up as a soundtrack. The hoax has been readily accepted in a number of reviews for the title. However, there neither is nor was any related film or plan to make one. This was, again, part of the elaborate ruse that played further into the premise of the roleplaying game. Atkinson confirmed in an interview that \\"There was never a Spaceship Zero movie, nor was there a TV show or radio serial upon which that movie was based.\\".

He is best known for his campaigns against Japanese during Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea. Won was a member of Wonju Won family, which was well known for its members' military accomplishments. He was born in 1540 near Pyeongtaek and demonstrated his skill as warrior at a young age. He was qualified as a military officer and was first assigned to the northern border to defend against the Jurchens, who frequently raided Korean villages. Won led many successful campaigns with Yi Il and Yi Sun-sin against the Jurchens. After considerable accomplishments on the northern frontier, he was promoted to admiral in 1592 and sent to the southern coast of Gyeongsang Province to command the province's Western Fleet, along with Yi Sun-sin, who became admiral before Won and took command of Jeolla Province's Eastern Fleet. At the time, Won and Yi were cavalry leaders who had no experience with naval warfare.  Military career  Upon passing the qualification exam, he was assigned to the northern border to defend against the Jurchens, who frequently raided Korean villages. Won led successful campaigns along with Yi Il and Yi Sun-sin against the Jurchens. He was promoted to admiral in 1592 and sent to the southern coast of Gyeongsang Province to command the province's Eastern Fleet, with Yi Sun-sin, who became admiral before Won and took command of Jeolla Province's Western Fleet. At the time, Won and Yi were cavalry leaders who had no experience with naval warfare. = Before the Japanese invasion = Japan had just united after a long period of internal warfare by a new leader, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who had become supreme ruler over most of Japan by killing many rivals to rise to power. He decided to begin an expansionist war against Japan's neighbors. Some Koreans realized that the threat from Japan was great and argued that the Joseon dynasty needed to prepare for invasion from Japan as well as the existing Jurchen menace. However, the government was divided along factional lines, and officials could not reach a decision. Hideyoshi saw the chance to take Korea unprepared. = First wave of Japanese invasion = On April 13, 1592, the Japanese fleet,.under Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, launched a sudden strike on the Eastern Fleet of Gyeongsang province and disabled every ship under its control. The main army under Kato and Konishi Yukinaga landed on the Korean Peninsula the next day and marched northward. Won, the commander of the Eastern Fleet of Gyeongsang Province, was also routed by the invading Japanese. (Won's predecessor was able to pass a fleet combat readiness inspection just one year before the war.) With the able force, Admiral Won may have had an opportunity to intercept and engage Japanese invading forces at sea, thus perhaps preventing or delaying the Japanese incursion on Korean soil. However, he decided not to act upon the naval intelligence regarding the Japanese incursion until the Japanese landing party had established a beachhead and successfully laid siege upon the city of Busan. At that point, Won sank many of his ships in retreat to ensure they would not be captured by invading Japanese forces. With four ships left under his command, Won called for help from Yi Sun-sin, who had prepared for war and raised a smaller and battle ready fleet. King Seonjo finally ordered both admirals to fight against the Japanese forces on May 2, 1592. Won and Yi began their campaign two days later, with Admiral Yi Eok Ki, the commander of the Eastern Fleet of Jeolla Province who later became the commander of the Western Fleet of the same Province following Yi's promotion. On May 7, the Korean navy under Yi destroyed a Japanese fleet in the Battle of Okpo. Later, Won was promoted to an army general, and Yi became naval chief of staff. = Plot to remove Yi Sun-sin = In 1597, Japanese decided to stop all negotiations with the Koreans and Chinese Ming Dynasty and planned a re-invasion of Korea. To do so, they plotted to remove Admiral Yi Sun-sin from his position. Japanese spies directed by Konishi Yukinaga spread word that Kat≈ç Kiyomasa was urging other Japanese to continue fighting and would soon be crossing the sea. King Seonjo ordered Admiral Yi to capture Kato, but Yi refused to do so, as he knew that the words were the fabrications of Japanese agents. Seonjo was in fear of a possible coup d'√©tat attempt by Yi or by his supporters, which was never plotted, but Seonjo convinced himself it could happen any day: Yi refused to carry out his orders several times and his fleet was the strongest combat force on both sides. Yi refused to carry out the orders purely due to tactical reasons, but the act of insubordination itself, no matter how justifiable, frightened the King beyond his breaking point. King Seonjo finally ordered the execution of Yi, but the royal court reluctantly yet successfully resisted the order and was able to lower the punishment to imprisonment and demotion. Yi was placed under the command of Gwon Yul to recover from his wounds from the torture administered during the investigation of the charges against him. Seonjo then replaced Yi with Won Gyun as the naval chief of staff. = Battle of Chilcheonryang ‚Äî Won Gyun's first and last naval engagement= Won also knew the information was false and did not advance toward Busan for the same tactical reasons Yi reported to the royal court before his removal from the post. Yi was removed for refusing orders to engage the Japanese. The government continued to trust the information and ordered Won to attack Japanese ships at Ungch≈èn. Won attacked the Japanese ‚Äî who were mostly unarmed and protected under the cease-fire treaty to support the negotiation process which was about to be terminated ‚Äî and defeated them. He lost one of his battleships and its captain during the attack. He did not advance after receiving a letter of protest from the Japanese commander. Then Field Marshal Gwon Yul, who was also under heavy pressure from the king, recalled Won to his headquarters and once again ordered him to attack Busan. Won finally led the navy towards Busan, along with the famous admiral Yi Eok Ki, following orders despite tactical considerations. The Japanese at first seemed to retreat, but it was a trap. The Japanese were prepared to devastate the Joseon navy before land invasion. The number of Japanese ships was so great that most Koreans were already frightened, including Admiral Bae Seol. The Japanese fleet, commanded by Todo Takatora, advanced toward Won Gyun's fleets. Won knew that he would lose the battle but had no choice but to engage. At the Battle of Chilchonryang, most of Joseon Navy's ships were destroyed. Won was considered to be killed in action while running away, when his brother was killed during this battle. Only the small detachment of twelve warships under the command of admiral Bae S≈èl ‚Äî who refused to participate and fled even before the battle began ‚Äî survived. Every other ship in the combat was destroyed or disabled, along with almost all of Joseon navy line officers and many capable mid-level commanders.  Aftermath  The battle opened the route for Japanese to advance to Yellow Sea, and Todo set up the plan to attack Hanyang from land and sea with Kat≈ç Kiyomasa and Konishi Yukinaga. However, Japan's hopes were crushed again by Yi Sun-sin's return at the Battle of Myeongnyang, which would decide the winner of the devastating war. Despite any historical controversy, Won Gyun and Yi Sun-sin received commendations following their deaths.  Legacy  Next to his military career, Won Gyun is perhaps best known for his personal faults, which included excessive alcohol consumption and attempts at adultery. In his War Diaries, Yi Sun-Sin recalls reports and rumors about \\"cruel deeds\\" committed by Won and even mentions an incident in which Won had unsuccessfully attempted to seduce one of his subordinates's wife, calling him a \\"wicked man\\" and (at least partially) blaming him for his degradation (\\"Won employs all means to entrap me\\").Yi Sun-sin, Nanjung Ilgi, pp. 266, 267-268. Much controversy lingers in regard to Won Gyun as a military leader. Widely panned by scholars and historians, there is recent research to suggest that Won Gyun may have been excessively vilified during the Park Chung-Hee administration to elevate Yi Sun-sin by juxtaposition. In particular, Won Gyun's earlier successes against the Jurchens have been buried and there is an interest in providing a more objective view of Won Gyun's military career. While fault exists for Won Gyun's mistakes as a naval officer, much of the blame of the troubles during that period lies in the factionalized incompetence of the royal court. However, it is still hard to ignore his actions and lack of competency as a naval commander, and blame the political instability and indecision of the royal court for the result of the battle of Chilcheonryang. The battle led to the near-complete annihilation of the Korean navy in a single engagement against the Japanese, who were heretofore unable to prevail against the Koreans in a naval engagement.

Washington's Tomb is an empty burial chamber two stories directly below the Rotunda of the United States Capitol building. It was included in the original design of the building by William Thornton and intended to entomb the body of George Washington, the first President of the United States. The original design of the rotunda, and the Crypt beneath it, included a central glass floor allowing the public to view Washington's Tomb two floors below, but this was never implemented. When Washington died in 1799, the Capitol was still under construction. Both houses of Congress passed a resolution calling for Washington to be entombed in the Capitol upon its completion. Martha Washington agreed to the plan despite the presence in her husband's will of a provision that he be buried at Mount Vernon. However, the original resolution was never carried out due to disputes over the specific design and cost of the tomb and the body was placed in a temporary tomb at Mount Vernon. Congress again attempted to resolve these issues in 1800, 1816, 1824, and 1829, when the Architect of the Capitol prepared plans for the tomb in anticipation of the approaching centennial of Washington's birth. Congress renewed its call to transfer the body to the Capitol in 1830, after an attempt to steal Washington's head in which the Mount Vernon tomb was vandalized and several of Washington's relatives' corpses desecrated in 1830, but the current owner of the property, John Washington, decided to build a new, more secure tomb on the site instead. Formerly, the Lincoln Catafalque was stored and exhibited in the tomb. It is kept, at present, in a specially constructed display area in the Exhibition Hall of the Capitol Visitor Center.

Before Zach has the opportunity to kill Mike, Susan wrestles the gun away from him and Zach runs away. Later, Susan discovers that Mike does not want to press charges against Zach, who is still missing. When she questions him, Mike confesses that Zach is his biological son. Susan tearfully congratulates Mike, but tells him that she cannot keep dating him if he continues to search for Zach, given Zach's history with her daughter Julie. Rex's mother, Phyllis Van de Kamp (Shirley Knight), comes to town for Rex's funeral. She and Bree clash heads throughout her visit, especially when Phyllis claims that Bree made Rex miserable during his last years, prompting Bree to disinvite her from the funeral. Eventually, Bree reconsiders; however, during the service, Bree discovers that Rex is being buried in his high school tie, which Phyllis insisted but Bree expressly forbade. Bree changes Rex's tie in the middle of the funeral. With Carlos in prison, John assumes that he and Gabrielle will continue their relationship, but Gabrielle is livid after John told Carlos about their affair.

Unwilling to actually take a test, Gabrielle obtains another patient's results and passes them off to Carlos as her own. Nevertheless, Carlos tells her that he is not satisfied. Lynette interviews for a job in an advertisement firm. Her interviewer, an irritable woman named Nina Fletcher (Joely Fisher), is skeptical of Lynette's competence after learning that she has four children, but asks her to come back for a final interview with her boss anyway. After Tom throws out his back, Lynette is forced to bring Penny, her toddler, to the second interview. Despite these unusual circumstances, Lynette manages to impress Nina's boss, Ed Ferrara (Currie Graham), who hires her on the spot.

Depending on the jurisdiction, other things like fences, landscaping, septic tanks, and various potential hazards or nuisances might be regulated and prohibited by setback lines. Setbacks along state, provincial, or federal highways may also be set in the laws of the state or province, or the federal government. Local governments create setbacks through ordinances, zoning restrictions, and Building Codes, usually for reasons of public policy such as safety, privacy, and environmental protection. Neighborhood developers may create setback lines (usually defined in Covenants & Restrictions, and set forth in official neighborhood maps) to ensure uniform appearance in the neighborhood and prevent houses from crowding adjacent structures or streets. In some cases, building ahead of a setback line may be permitted through special approval. Overview Homes usually have a setback from the property boundary, so that they cannot be placed close together. Setbacks may also allow for public utilities to access the buildings, and for access to utility meters. In some municipalities, setbacks are based on street right-of-ways, and not the front property line. Nonetheless, many of the world's cities, such as those built in the US before 1916 and the beginnings of zoning in the United States, do not employ setbacks. Zoning ‚Äìand laws pertaining to site development, such as setbacks for front lawns‚Äì has been criticized recently by urban planners (most notably Jane Jacobs) for the role that these laws have played in producing urban sprawl and automobile-dependent, low-density cities. Older houses have smaller setbacks between properties, as walking was a primary mode of transportation and the distance people walked to actual destinations and, eventually, streetcar stops had to be kept short out of necessity. Distances of one to five feet at most are common in neighborhoods built in the United States before 1890, when the electric streetcar first became popular. Most suburbs laid out before 1920 have narrow lots and setbacks of five to fifteen feet between houses. As automobile ownership became common, setbacks increased further because zoning laws required developers to leave large spaces between the house and street. Recently, in some areas of the United States, setback requirements have been lowered so as to permit new homes and other structures to be closer to the street, one facet of the low impact development urban design movement. This permits a more usable rear yard and limits new impervious surface areas for the purposes of stormwater infiltration. Mailboxes, on the other hand, often have a maximum setback instead of a minimum one. A postal administration or postmaster may mandate that if a mailbox on a street is too far from the curb for the letter carrier to insert mail, without having to get out of the vehicle, the mail may not be delivered to that address at all until the situation is corrected. Setbacks in Canada British Columbia uses a minimum setback of 4.5 metres (15 feet) of any building, mobile home, retaining wall, or other structure from all highway rights-of-way under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure unless the building has access from another street, in which case the allowed setback is 3 metres (10 feet).http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/permits/Structures%20Permits.asp References Land management Urban studies and planning terminology Zoning ","title":"Setback (land use)"},{"id":"2832737","text":"Parahepialiscus is a monotypic moth genus of the family Hepialidae.

The word is derived from the Latin noun munimentum, meaning a \\"fortification, bulwark, defence or protection\\".Cassell's Latin Dictionary Thus \\"muniments of title\\" means the written evidence which a land owner can use to defend title to his estate.Black's Law Dictionary 1019 (6th ed. 1990) An example of Muniment of Title is the use of a death certificate of a joint tenant to prove that title resides with the surviving joint tenant. In the USA the definition of \\"muniment\\" may differ in statutes state by state. For example, states often have their own version of a Marketable Record Title Act (MRTA) which will extinguish various interests, restrictions, or claims to a property within a certain time period unless renewed during that time period by muniments. :\\"A muniment of title is any documentary evidence upon which title is based. Muniments of title are deeds, wills, and court judgments through which a particular land title passes and upon which its validity depends. Muniments of title need not be recorded to be valid notwithstanding that the recording statutes give good faith purchasers certain rights over the rights of persons claiming under unrecorded muniments of title. Muniments of title do more than merely \\"affect\\" title; they must carry title and be a vital link in the chain of title.\\"Cunningham v. Haley, 501 So. 2d 649 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986) In the medieval period substantial landowners made use of dedicated chambers known as \\"muniments rooms\\" for the secure storage of muniments of title. Before the advent of capitalism and the stock-market investment, the ownership of land and operational manors was the principal asset used by the English gentry for the long-term storage of wealth. It was essential to prove \\"devolution of title\\" to an estate, which necessitated the retention of every historical deed which had been used at some time over decades if not centuries to transfer legal ownership of that estate. For example, if it had been determined historically in a court of law that \\"person X\\" had good title to an estate at some past date, the present owner, in order to have equally good title, needed to prove that he had obtained, in a valid manner, the asset directly or indirectly from person X. For example, if a royal charter survived granting a manor to person X, that would constitute an ideal starting point from which to prove devolution of title. Thus several charters, indentures, entails, marriage settlements and last will and testaments of varying dates and contained within several sheets of parchment might form the complete devolution of title for just one estate. Many gentry families in England held particular estates for many centuries (the Berkeley family has held Berkeley Castle since the 12th century and holds it still in 2015), generating a large volume of documents of title as the estate passed down the generations of the family. Such often large and highly verbose documents were generally folded up to form small packets and were then sealed with wax, with an epitome or summary of the document written in ink on the finished packet. In 21st century England, the establishment of the Government department of the Land Registry and the compulsory requirement for persons and companies to register all land transactions, renders the use of title deeds superfluous and devolution of title is not required to prove title as proof of title is now determined prima facie merely by an entry in the land register, a certificate certifying which entry can be provided by the registrar if required. In previous times title deeds were the main evidence of ownership (apart from physical possession of land, said by the old adage to form \\"nine tenths of the law\\"), and where a person owned dozens of estates, many of which he rarely or never visited, and ownership of which was frequently the subject of legal challenges, for example by distant relatives of testators, it was essential to safeguard title deeds. Security needed to provide not only against theft, but also against destruction of the parchment (i.e. animal skin) and ink by fire, excessive heat, sunlight, water, mould, insects and rodents. Thus in certain monasteries the muniments room was often situated above the warming house. Special chests were used, designed specifically to aid preservation. Rapid portability of muniments was also a consideration, in case of fire or armed attack of the building. The intact muniments room of an ancient mansion house or castle was frequently found by modern historians and genealogists to provide a rich source of materials for research purposes.

Another example is the Chinese publication Raising the Five Star Flag on Mount Tomur, an account of the successful Chinese expedition of 1977 to the Tien Shan peak better known by its Russian name as Pik Pobedy (nowadays renamed yet again by Kyrgyzstan as Jengish Chokusu).SummitPost - Pik Pobeda/Tomur Feng - Climbing, Hiking & Mountaineering The Chinese volume seems to imply a first ascent and completely ignores multiple Russian ascents. Other examples The strangest oropolitical events must surely be the unpublicised ascents of Nanda Devi and Nanda Kot by joint Indo-US expeditions in the 1960s to plant devices to monitor Chinese nuclear activity.M.S. Kohli and K. Conboy, \\"Spies in the Himalayas\\", 2003. The media disclosure in 1978 that an Indo-American covert expedition had planted a nuclear-fuelled monitoring device atop Nanda Kot in the 1960s, and that subsequently the device had disappeared, led to fears of radioactive contamination of the river Ganges, and a political brouhaha. Recent examples of oropolitics, again from India, were the claimed ascent of Nyegyi Kangsang (7047 m) and the attempt on the nearby peak Kangto (7090 metres) by Indian teams in the 1990s.Articles in The Himalayan Journal, 1996, Mumbai. Both are remote Arunachal Pradesh peaks difficult of access, located on or very close to the India-China border. These were as much sporting activities as visible demonstrations of de facto control of India over terrain claimed by China. It has been suggested that the actual summit of Nyegyi Kangsang was not even reached. Jawad Raza Khan, \\"The Myth of Siachien :An extreme case of Oro-politics\\", Pakpotpourri. On line. A simmering dispute between China and Bhutan over Kula Kangri (7554? metres), which is possibly located wholly in Chinese territory, but is claimed by Bhutan to lie on the Bhutan-China border and be the highest peak of Bhutan, has clear oropolitical overtones. A Japanese team attempting nearby Gangkhar Puensum (7570? metres) on the Bhutan-China border in 1999 from the Chinese side stopped short of the true peak due to the King of Bhutan having prohibited ascent of the unclimbed main summit.Kangkar Punsum and Kula Kangri References Political terminology Mountaineering Politics and sports ","title":"Oropolitics"},{"id":"2832746","text":"Chanay is a commune in the Ain department in eastern France.

The book deals with the Indian Air Force's role in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 that started on 1 September 1965 and came to an end on 23 September 1965. Background The air war was one of the last in which classic turning dogfights took place between the two belligerents. The Pakistan Air Force employed largely American hardware. The North American F-86 Sabre, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the Martin B-57 Canberra (based on the British aircraft the English Electric Canberra). The Indian Air Force employed Russian and British aircraft like the Hawker Hunter, Folland Gnat and the MiG-21s.

Along with the Mobile Einsatzkommando (MEK), Personenschutzkommando (Bodyguards) and the Verhandlungsgruppe (Negotiation teams in some states), they are part of the police Spezialeinheiten of each state. Mainly unrecognized by the media and public, the main missions of SEK units are to serve high-risk arrest warrants and to deal with barricaded suspects. Hostage sieges, kidnappings and raids also belong to their missions as well as other scenarios like personal security detail for VIPs or witnesses. Since the 1970s, each SEK has handled several thousand deployments. The front-runner is the SEK of the Berlin Police with up to 500 deployments a year, an average of 1.4 deployments a day. The comparable unit of the German Federal Police is the GSG 9. History SEK operators raid a hijacked ship during a public exhibition. In 1974, the first SEK unit was raised in police forces of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. After West and East Germany were unified in 1990, some ex-officers of the Diensteinheit IX in the Volkspolizei were merged into the SEKs after thorough political evaluation procedures, such as with SEK units in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and in Sachsen- Anhalt. The SEK received a name change from Sondereinsatzkommando to Spezialeinsatzkommando when it was announced in 2013 because the former is usually associated with Sondereinsatzkommando Eichmann a unit in the Nazi Schutzstaffel (SS) tasked with overseeing the deportation of Hungary's Jewish residents.New Lives: Survivors of the Holocaust Living in America by Dorothy Rabinowitz, page 183 In 2015, the SEK was called in to intervene in Erfurt, Thuringia after a 48-year-old man barricaded himself in his apartment and acted violently towards emergency medical personnel. An SEK operator was wounded during the raid. A Reichsb√ºrgerbewegung supporter was confronted by the police in 2016 in Bavaria with the SEK deployed with one operator shot dead after they were ordered to seize the man's weapons due to being mentally unfit to handle them. Organization The organization of special police forces varies from state to state. Whilst most states have created one SEK which is based in their capital city, others have more than one. North Rhine- Westphalia Police or Rheinland-Pfalz State Police have established SEKs in other major cities as needed. The Bavarian State Police and Hessen State Police both have two SEKs ‚Äì one each for the north and the south. Most SEKs would have 40 to 70 operators attached, depending on the state. A SEK unit can be attached to the Bereitschaftspolizei riot police or to big regional police headquarters. However, the common trend is to put the SEK units under control of the Landeskriminalamt (LKA). Many LKA have special divisions which consist of the SEK, MEK and crisis negotiation teams. The internal organisation of SEKs rests with the units and therefore differs as well. The SEK of South Bavaria has an alpine component and the SEK units of Bremen and Hamburg have elements trained for maritime tasks. Some SEKs also have specialized negotiation groups (Verhandlungsgruppen, commonly abbreviated as VGs) for cases like hostage situations or suicide attempts. Eligibility and training Any state police officer is eligible to apply for service in a SEK unit, but it is common only to consider applications from officers with at least three years of duty experience. The age limit is mostly between 23 and 35 years, whilst operatives have to leave the entry teams when they reach the age of 42 (or 45 in some states). Both sexes can be recruited; however, only a few policewomen have been able to handle the extensive and challenging tests. At the moment, only the SEK units of Hamburg,The SEK-equivalent unit in Hamburg is also called MEK. Schleswig-Holstein and Southern Hesse have women in their ranks. The requirements demand physical and mental strength, discernment and capacity for teamwork. About 30 percent of all candidates pass the tests. The length of the training necessary to become an operative in a SEK unit differs but is generally five to eight months long and covers a wide range of required skills. Some of their training requires SEK operators to train with other police forces in Europe and North America. All applications made to join the SEK are made online. SEK operators usually get a stipend between 150 and 400 Euros, depending on the state police force where they work in. Equipment SEK operators practice assaulting a building, armed with simunition Glocks. While firearms are still issued by the forces, SEK officers can order equipment they feel suit best for the missions. The following weapons are used by SEK: * Glock 17 * Heckler & Koch VP9, used by Saxony SEK. * Heckler & Koch P30 used by Hesse State Police and Federal Police MFE (covert commando) * SIG P226 * SIG P228 * Korth-type revolvers * Heckler & Koch USP pistols are utilized by some states. * Smith & Wesson Model 625, modified to be suppressed for Northrhine-Westphalia SEK operators. * Heckler & Koch MP5 * Heckler & Koch MP7 * Heckler & Koch UMP * Heckler & Koch G36, used by Brandenburg SEK. * FN SCAR Mk 16 * FN SCAR Mk 17 * Steyr AUG, only used by Bavaria SEK.Reinhard Scholzen: SEK, Spezialeinsatzkommandos der deutschen Polizei. 5. Auflage. Motorbuch-Verlag, Stuttgart 2009, , S. 59. * Haenel CR223 carbine, only used by Hamburg SEKs/MEKs and Saxony SEKs. * Heckler & Koch PSG1 The North Rhine-Westphalia SEK use Ford F-550 pickups modified to use MARS tactical ladders for raids on hard to reach places. The Saxony Police use the RMMV Survivor R and the Toyota Land Cruiser equipped with V8 engines as a first response vehicle. The Brandenburg State Police and the Hamburg State Police use the PMV Survivor I for its SEK units. The SEK of the Bavarian State Police uses the LAPV Enok. Uniforms SEK members do not always operate in uniform but do wear masks to protect their identities, as well as to protect their bodies from burns. If cited in a trial they are only referred to by numbers. When off-duty SEK officers are called to a crime scene, they may appear plain-clothed, only wearing their special protective gear and carrying their weapons.  Controversies  The SEK Cologne has been accused of harassment while performing an initiation ritual on a new member. These charges were later dropped. Meanwhile, Ex-GSG9 commander Ulrich Wegener accused the SEK of being badly disciplined since the officers were not punished. Related units = MEK = Federal Criminal Police Office during a demonstration. Mobile Einsatzkommandos (MEK) operate hand-in-hand with the SEKs. These plain-clothed units specialize in surveillance, quick arrests and mobile hostage sieges. They are used in investigations against organized crime, blackmailers or other serious offenses. MEKs also provide close protection for a state's senior leaders, including the state's minister president or interior minister. Requirements for duty as a MEK officer are similar but partially less strict than the requirements for the SEK.

General of Alexander In the autumn of 334 BC, while Alexander was in Caria, he sent those of his soldiers who had been recently married to Macedonia to spend the ensuing winter with their wives. Coenus was one of the commanders who led them back to Europe. In the spring of the following year (333 BC), Coenus returned with the Macedonians and joined Alexander at Gordium. After the conquest of Drangiana, in the latter part of 330 BC, Coenus joined others in accusing his wife's brother, Philotas, of treason for conspiring against Alexander. This led to the execution of Philotas, and the assassination of Coenus' father-in-law, Parmenion. Coenus commanded a battalion of Alexander's army, and distinguished himself on various occasions. In all of Alexander's major battles, Coenus commanded the right-most battalion of infantry in the massive Macedonian phalanx. In the Macedonian battle tradition, the most favoured soldiers were positioned on the right. In this regard, Coenus's distinction as commander of the \\"best\\" infantry of the phalanx indicates he was tactically reliable, probably extremely intelligent in warfare, and brave in battle; he was probably the epitome of the highly respected \\"lead-by-example\\" Macedonian general. Death When Alexander had arrived at the river Hyphasis, he was anxious to push his conquests still further. Coenus was the first of his commanders who had the boldness to urge the necessity of returning home, and the king was obliged to follow his advice. But a short time afterwards, when the Macedonian army had actually commenced its return, Coenus died of an illness (326 BC), and was honoured by the king with a splendid burial. Alexander lamented his death, but is reported to have said that Coenus had urged the necessity of returning so strongly, as if he alone had been destined to see his native country again.

He died after a long bout with cancer on 20 January 2009. Justice Mark Fernando dies He was known as a Judge who stood up for judicial independence and the integrity of the profession. Justice Mark Fernando helped groom a generation of capable and honourable lawyers. During the early 1990s, when he was a member of the Council of Legal Education, Justice Fernando initiated the Legal Internship Scheme to assist law students awaiting the results of the final examination to qualify as attorneys-at-law. He believed that in order to provide sound legal advice an attorney must have a working knowledge of other disciplines besides law: for instance, he would point out that a lawyer asked by a client to advise on setting up a company must have some knowledge of finance, accountancy, human resource management, etc, in addition to being familiar with the provisions of the Companies Act. Since it was not possible to provide all that knowledge within the structure of education that existed at the Law College at the time, the Internship Scheme sought to place law students for a period of six months in the private sector, and with senior practitioners specialising in various aspects of law. Following his elevation to the Supreme Court in 1988 he became a firm defender of the rights and liberties guaranteed by the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. His judgments on the right to free speech, its relationship to the right to information, and his strong defence of the right of citizens to criticize and peacefully protest against their government are cited often.

At the passing away of Justice Mark Fernando, the Alumni Association of the Faculty of Law (AAFL) issuing a special message stated that \\"No other judge has perhaps contributed as much towards the progress of legal jurisprudence in this country as Justice Fernando. From Public Law to Fundamental Rights, from Property to Criminal Law, his razor-sharp intellect has produced judgments that are masterprices of contemporary critical legal thinking\\". Resignation In 2005, Fernando opted to take premature retirement from the Supreme Court, two and half years before his term ended. He was then the longest serving judge on the bench. The right man, in wrong times Towards the end of his career, Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva had excluded him from hearings relating to the constitutionality of bills before the Parliament. A massive signature campaign was launched to persuade Fernando to stay on to complete his term. Signatories covered a wide range of the political spectrum, lawyers and law students as well as the ecclesiastical heads of the Buddhist, Catholic, Anglican and Methodist denominations. The Asian Human Rights Commission, issuing a statement on the resignation of Justice Mark Fernando, warned that a senior judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, retiring two and half years earlier before his stipulated date of retirement, indicates a dangerous phenomena beginning to emerge, which is a sure sign of the erosion of independent judiciary and the Rule of Law in the country.http://www.priu.gov.lk/news_update/features/20030903judicial_independence_rule_of_law_sri_lanka.htm Bibliography *Habin, Haroon (2000). \\"Calls for Strengthening Judiciary in SAARC States.\\" The Hindu. *Sorabjee, Soli (1999). \\"Out of Court: Sri Lankan Judiciary, Tagore & the Millennium.\\" The Times of India.
