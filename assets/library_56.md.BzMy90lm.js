Background and Newcastle propositions  In 1646 the Scots captured King Charles I and opened negotiations with Parliament. It demanded the Newcastle propositions that included accepting the covenant, installing a Presbyterian form of church government, giving Parliament control of the Army for 20 years, and turn over key supporters for punishment. Charles refused to accept these stiff terms.Charles L. Hamilton, \\"Anglo-Scottish Militia Negotiations, March-April 1646.\\" Scottish Historical Review (1963): 86-88 in JSTOR.  Main propositions  The main propositions were: * Royalists had to wait five years before running for or holding an office. * The Book of Common Prayer was allowed to be read but not mandatory, and no penalties should be made for not going to church, or attending other acts of worship. * The sitting Parliament was to set a date for its own termination. Thereafter, biennial Parliaments were to be called (i.e. every two years), which would sit for a minimum of 120 days and maximum of 240 days. Constituencies were to be reorganized. * Episcopacy would be retained in church government, but the power of the bishops would be substantially reduced. * Parliament was to control the appointment of state officials and officers in the army and navy for 10 years.  King Charles' reaction  Even after the occupation of London by the New Model Army had taken place, Parliament, instead of taking up the Heads of the Proposals as the basis of a settlement of the kingdom, sent to the King a revised edition of the Newcastle Propositions, differing mainly in that it proposed a limited toleration for dissentient Puritans, whilst forbidding all use of the book of Common Prayer. In his reply to their propositions, the King, on 14 September, expressed a preference for the Proposals of the Army, as more conducive \\"to the satisfaction of all interests and a fitter foundation for a lasting peace\\".Firth (1901), Cites: Rushworth vii. 810. Major Huntington's letterFirth (1901), p. 225. shows that the King expected the leaders of the Army to stand by him in procuring an offer of better terms from parliament.Firth (1901) The question of a new treaty was discussed in the House of Commons on 22 and 23 September 1647. Henry Marten and his party were eager for the passing of a vote to make no further addresses to the King. Cromwell and Ireton, on the other hand, opposed Marten's motion, and the House finally resolved on 23 September that they would once again make application to the King. This decision led to much discontent amongst the Levelling party in the Army as also outside of it, and \\"the credit and reputation\\" of both Cromwell and Ireton was much blasted thereby.Firth (1901), p. 228. They were accused of falsely representing it to be the desire and sense of the Army that this new application should be made to the King. The charge is thus stated by Wildman in his Putney Projects (p. 43). Because Oliver Cromwell and Henry Ireton negotiated with the King, they lost the army radicals' support. The radicals criticized their \\"servility\\" to the king. Without an amicable solution between the Army, King, English Parliament, and the Scots the Second English Civil War started.  Historical importance  Although the \\"Heads of Proposals\\" was never adopted, Ireton promoted it in the Putney Debates. He presented it as a moderate alternative to the Agreement of the People. Elements of \\"Heads of Proposals\\" were incorporated in the Instrument of Government.Tyacke p. 69Farr pp. 80,81. See Declaration of Representation of 14 June 1647 The Instrument of Government was the written constitution that defined Oliver Cromwell's powers as Lord Protector. The religious settlement proposed by Ireton in 1647 was virtually identical to that finally adopted in the Toleration Act 1688.

Plumer, 380 U.S. 460 (1965), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court further refined the Erie doctrine regarding when and by what means federal courts are obliged to apply state law in cases brought under diversity jurisdiction. The question in the instant case was whether Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing service of process should yield to state rules governing the service of process in diversity cases. The Court ruled that under the facts of this case, federal courts shall apply the federal rule. Background of the case On February 6, 1963, petitioner, a citizen of Ohio, filed her complaint in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, claiming damages in excess of $10,000 for personal injuries resulting from an automobile accident in South Carolina, allegedly caused by the negligence of one Louise Plumer Osgood, a Massachusetts citizen deceased at the time of the filing of the complaint. Respondent, Mrs. Osgood's executor and also a Massachusetts citizen, was named as defendant. The Massachusetts rule at the time required personal service of process on the executor of an in-state defendant, while Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (d)(1) required only that service be made on a competent adult who resides at the residence of the defendant. The plaintiff left process at the residence of the executor, and so complied with the federal rule but not the state rule. The District Court granted summary judgment to the executor for the plaintiff's failure to make adequate service of process, ruling that the state rule applied based on the Supreme Court's prior precedents. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed. The Court's decision Chief Justice Earl Warren delivered the majority opinion, which held that the adoption of rule 4(d)(1) did not overstep the constitutional boundaries or the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the Rules Enabling Act (28 U.S.C. 2072) noting that \\"...the test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure...\\" Thus it was appropriate to apply Rule 4(d)(1) (now FRCP (4)(e)(2)) and not Massachusetts law in the Federal District Court. In reaching this decision the Court stated that the rule that state and federal courts should reach outcomes substantially the same was not a \\"talisman\\" and that there were more basic principles governing Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins and its progeny (that is, cases dealing with how Federal courts should apply state law). The purpose of Erie was to 1) discourage \\"forum shopping\\" and 2) avoid inequitable administration of laws. The instant case must be viewed in this light. While the outcome of the current case is determined by which law is applied, the rights in question are not substantial enough to create problems of unequal protection and because in Erie and its progeny there was no explicit conflict between state and federal rules. Thus, in those cases the Court held not that state rules trumped federal rules but that the federal rules, narrowly construed, did not cover the dispute whereas in the current case the federal and state laws are in direct conflict and the court has been instructed to follow the Federal Rule in these cases and there is no constitutional reason not to do so. In short, outcome determinative judgments are important under the American legal system for deciding if a state or federal rule applies but in the current case denying the federal rule would remove any power whatsoever the federal courts have over their procedures. Harlan argued that forum shopping and equitable administration of laws were not the only concerns in Erie because public uncertainty over which laws govern would be debilitating and therefore state law controls where it is an issue of affecting \\"primary decisions respecting human conduct.\\" Under this understanding federal laws could be trumped by a state law, whether substantive or procedural law, meaning that Harlan's test is somewhere in between the \\"outcome determinative test\\" which gives extreme deference to state laws and the \\"forum shopping/equitable administration test\\" given in the case at hand, which states that a party must \\"substantially\\" raise equal protection issues.

The windowless structure is an addition to the original hotel. It contains ballrooms, meeting and conference rooms, added in the early 1950s. The Hotel Muehlebach () is a historic hotel building in Downtown Kansas City that was visited by every President from Theodore Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan. It is currently operated as one of three wings of the Kansas City Marriott Downtown hotel. History The property, then the site of the First Baptist Church, was acquired in 1914 by the Muehlebach Estate Co., owned by George E. Muehlebach, whose father, George E. Muehlebach Sr., founded the Muehlebach Beer Company. Muehlebach demolished the church and built a 12-story, 144 foot (44m) high brown brick hotel building designed by Holabird & Roche at a cost of $2 million. It opened as the Hotel Muehlebach in May, 1915. The younger Muehlebach also built Muehlebach Field. On December 5, 1922, the hotel was the location of the first regular radio program broadcast by a band, when Carleton Coon and Joe Sanders began broadcasting the performances of their Coon-Sanders Original Nighthawk Orchestra nationwide. Manager Barney Allis took over the hotel in 1931, and during his lengthy tenure, the hotel welcomed celebrities including Helen Keller, Ernest Hemingway, Babe Ruth,[Jean Harlow 1931] Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, Elvis Presley, and The Beatles. The hotel also hosted Presidents including Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, while Missouri-native Harry S. Truman stayed in the hotel‚Äôs Presidential Suite so frequently that the Muehlebach became known as White House West. In 1952, a 17-story western annex, called the Muehlebach Tower, and a parking lot, were added to the hotel. Allis later sold the hotel in the 1960s. The Radisson Hotels chain acquired the hotel in 1976, making it their flagship property at the time. As a result, it underwent a major six million dollar renovation, and began operating as the Radisson Muehlebach Hotel before closing a decade later in 1986. Operation as a wing of the Marriott Kansas City Downtown In 1996 Marriott Hotels bought the Muehlebach and made it into an extension of the Kansas City Marriott Downtown, a huge adjacent hotel originally built in 1985 as the Vista International Hotel. They imploded the 1952 Muehlebach Tower annex building and in 1998 built a new, modern Muehlebach tower, with a similar facade, in its place that met current building code standards. A \\"skybridge\\" was also built that connects both hotel buildings on their second floors. The original 1915 Muehlebach building's lobby and ballrooms were restored to period and are now used as banquet and convention facilities by the Marriott; the original hotel room floors above have been gutted and remain unused. Crowd watching the 1996 implosion of the Muehlebach Towers. Barbershop Harmony Society The Barbershop Harmony Society (SPEBSQSA, Inc.) traces its beginnings to a chance meeting in 1938 in the Muehlebach's lobby between two businessmen from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The two found two other men and sang their way through a snowstorm that had marooned all four at the hotel. A few weeks later, they convened several like-minded singers at a meeting in Tulsa, and from that the 25,000 member international organization was founded. The two businessmen's original meeting is now commemorated on a plaque in the restored original lobby of the hotel. Famous guests During the 1928 Republican National Convention, held across the street at Convention Hall, Herbert Hoover frequented the hotel. Howard Hughes had the presidential suite during his 1945 stay. The Muehlebach was the White House headquarters for Harry S. Truman during his frequent visits to his home in nearby Independence, Missouri. Truman stayed in Independence but conducted business in the Presidential Suite in the hotel's penthouse. Truman signed the Truman Doctrine legislation aid for Turkey and Greece at the hotel on May 22, 1947. Truman predicted his upset victory to staffers at the hotel during election night 1948 (although he spent the night out of the media spotlight at the Elms Hotel in Excelsior Springs, Missouri). The Presidential Suite was later renamed the Harry S. Truman Presidential Suite following his terms of office. Roy O. Disney spent the night in July 1956 before spending the Fourth of July in Marceline, Missouri with his brother, Walt Disney. \\"To Honor Walt Disney: Famous Artist to Marceline Park Event Wednesday\\" Kansas City (MO) Times 6/29/1956 In 1959 the Society of American Registered Architects (SARA), founded by architect Wilfred Gregson in 1956 with the mission of \\"Architect Helping Architect\\", held its first national conference at the Hotel Muehlebach. Gregson reported to those assembled: \\"You are the ones who have made the first great step toward a unified profession of architects. You are a living report that will go to every part of these fifty United States\\". In the fall of 1974, President Gerald Ford stayed at the Muehlebach when he was in town as the keynote speaker for the National FFA Convention. He shook hands with many of the FFA band members that were standing in a rope line in the lobby. The band members were also staying at the hotel the same week. During the 1976 Republican National Convention both Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan made pitches for delegates at the Radisson Muehlebach. Immediately following the 1976 Republican Convention, Robert A. Heinlein was the Guest of Honor at the 34th World Science Fiction Convention held at the Radisson Muehlebach and the Hotel Phillips, directly across the street. He was booked into the Muehlebach's Harry S. Truman Presidential Suite for the 5-day convention held during the 1976 Labor Day weekend. Among the other celebrity guests that stayed at the Muehlebach were Babe Ruth, the Beatles, and Elvis Presley.

Early life A grand-daughter of the poet, Samuel Coleridge, Christabel was born at St Mark's College, Chelsea, while her father, Derwent, was headmaster there. Her name pays homage to Samuel Coleridge's poem Christabel. For a time Coleridge helped her brother Ernest run a school, but her ambition was to be a writer. Writings, friendships She went on to publish more than 15 novels. The first was a children's historical story called Lady Betty (1869). Minstrel Dick (1896) is set mainly in the 14th-century Berkhamstead court of the dying Edward, the Black Prince. Her fiction expressed her concern with morality, and several of her books were published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.

It is located just outside the eastern border of Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory. It is administered by the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ), which is the formal name of the township as well. The member of parliament for Ampang is Zuraida Kamaruddin, who is the current Minister of Housing and Local Government of Malaysia. History According to history, Kuala Lumpur was founded in 1857 at the confluence of the Sungei Lumpur (now Gombak River) and the Klang River, which now houses the Kuala Lumpur Jamek Mosque. Before the arrival of the Chinese for tin mining, Kuala Lumpur was a small hamlet with only several shops and houses. Raja Abdullah, who is also the representative of the Sultan in Klang, and Raja Juma'at of Lukut sent 87 Chinese miners from Lukut in 1857 to open tin mines in Ampang, thus beginning the development of Kuala Lumpur. Ampang was one of the earliest areas in the Klang Valley to be opened for tin mining. The name \\"Ampang\\" derives from the old spelling of the Malay word empangan (or ampangan), meaning dam; the place was named in reference to the miners' dams. A road was built to connect Ampang to Kuala Lumpur which became Jalan Ampang of today. Between colonial rule and February 1974, Ampang district was part of the greater Kuala Lumpur district in Selangor. Following the creation of the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur on 1 February 1974, Ampang district was split into two; the western part, located within the Federal Territory, became Ampang Hilir, and the eastern part, remained in Selangor, as part of Hulu Langat (Kajang) District. During the height of the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s, the British established the Ampang New Village, which became one of the largest Chinese settlements in the Klang Valley. The Kau Ong Yah Lam Thian Kiong Temple (ÂÆâÈÇ¶ÂçóÂ§©ÂÆÆ) in Ampang New Village is famous for the 9 Emperor Gods festival, which is celebrated annually on the 9th month of the Chinese lunar calendar, between late-September and early-October. 1977 On 1 July 1992, the Gombak District Council (Majlis Daerah Gombak) and the Hulu Langat District Council (Majlis Daerah Hulu Langat) respectively ceded the districts of Ulu Klang and Ampang, forming the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council. One block of the Highland Towers, located within Ampang Jaya's territory, collapsed on 11 December 1993. On 16 December 1996, Malaysia's first metro line, the LRT Ampang Line, opened for service. Geography Ampang metro line depot, showing the old trains Situated to the east of Kuala Lumpur, Ampang Jaya covers an area of 143.5 km2, covering the parliamentary constituencies of Ampang, Pandan and Gombak, and stretches from Pandan Indah from the south, through Ampang town, Hulu Klang, Melawati, and touching the Klang Gates Dam in the north. Clockwise, Ampang Jaya borders the remainder of Hulu Langat District in the east and south, the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur in the west, Gombak District in the north, and a short border with Bentong (Pahang) in the northeast. Neighbourhoods The oldest neighbourhoods are * Kampung Tasik * Tasek Permai * Ampang New Village * Ampang Town * Ampang Malay Village * Ampang Newtown * Taman Dagang * Dato' Ahmad Razali Flats * Taman Nirwana Other major neighbourhoods in Ampang are * Ampang Indah * Ampang Mewah * Ampang Permai * Ampang Jaya * Lembah Jaya * Taman Dagang * Taman Ampang Indah * Kampung Ampang Indah * Taman Dagang Jaya * Taman Cahaya * Taman Cempaka * Taman Bakti * Taman Nirwana * Taman Kosas * Taman Sri Watan * Taman Rasmi Jaya * Taman Bukit Indah * Taman Kesuma * Taman Hillview * Taman Sri Raya * Taman Tasik Tambahan * Taman Putra * Ulu Kelang * Pandan Jaya * Pandan Indah * Taman Tun Abdul Razak (Taman TAR) Taman TAR is one of the most expensive residential areas in the country. Attractions and shopping Pekan Ampang, the colonial quarter of the town, is located just east of the Ampang LRT station, along the intersection of Jalan Besar Ampang and Jalan Ampang. The building's architecture in town is similar to most towns and cities in the developing world during the British colonial period. Ampang has a few small shopping complexes such as Ampang Point (near One Ampang Avenue and beside the Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2 (MRR2), MidPoint (Pandan Indah), Paragon (Taman Muda Ampang), Pandan Kapital (beside Menara MPAJ in Pandan Indah), Spectrum Mall Ampang (Bandar Baru Ampang), Galaxy Ampang (near Taman Nirwana Ampang) and Ampang Tesco (beside the MRR2 near the Pandan Jaya exit) and also a newly opened Aeon Big (previously known as Carrefour) Ampang at the end of Jalan Ampang, near Taman Dagang. Demographics Ampang is known for its diverse ethnic makeup. Data from MPAJ shows that 56.5% of Ampang Jaya's residents are Malays, while the Chinese make up about 30%. Indians make up 7%, while the remainder is made up of other ethnicities, nationalities and expatriates. Malays mostly concentrate in the wards of Ulu Klang, Taman Melawati and Bukit Antarabangsa, while the Chinese are more concentrated around Pandan Indah, Taman Putra, Bandar Baru Ampang, and the Ampang New Village. Ampang Jaya is notable for being home to Malaysia's largest Korean settlement, centred at the One Ampang Avenue ward, just across Jalan Ampang from the Ampang Point shopping mall. Ampang Jaya is also home to a sizeable Arab community, as well as Indonesians. During the 1980s and 1990s there were also Japanese expatriates. Food Thanks to its ethnic makeup, one can find a large variety of cuisine in the city, especially Malay and Indonesian cuisine. Ampang is known for its Lemang, a Malay sticky rice with coconut milk in bamboo. Lemang stalls can be found at any major roadsides in Ampang, more often during the Fasting month and Eid-ul-Fitr. Other local foods include Burger Bakar (Toast Burger), Satay (a specialty of Kajang), Laksa and variety of Malay kueh. Popular food districts in Ampang include Taman Muhibbah, Taman Dagang, Desa Pandan, Lembah Keramat, Bukit Antarabangsa and Pandan Indah. Pandan Indah is notable for its concentration of Chinese and Hong Kong-styled caf√©s. Ampang is also known for its Yong Tau Foo, a Chinese stuffed vegetable soup dish with Hakka origins. Three restaurants in Ampang New Village serve the dish. Ampang also has many Korean restaurants, mostly near the One Ampang Avenue apartments near the Ampang Point shopping complex. Education International School of Kuala Lumpur (ISKL) secondary campus The International School of Kuala Lumpur (ISKL) secondary campus is in Ampang.

Parks For nature lovers, the National Zoo of Malaysia (Zoo Negara) is nearby and is one of the best attractions in Ampang, Selangor. Located in Hulu Klang, the National Zoo is only 10 minutes away from Ampang through Jalan Hulu Klang from Ampang Point shopping mall. Virtually unknown to outsiders, Taman Rimba Ampang (Ampang Recreational Forest) is a small recreational park with a small and shallow river. The Kuala Lumpur Look Out Point Tourist Complex was another hot spot located at Jalan Ampang‚ÄìHulu Langat but is closed for safety reasons. Politics Ampang is represented in the Dewan Rakyat of the Malaysian Parliament by Zuraida Kamaruddin of BERSATU. She has held the seat since 2008. On the state level, Ampang contributes two seats to the Selangor State Legislative Assembly, namely: * Lembah Jaya, represented by Haniza Mohamed Talha of BERSATU; and * Bukit Antarabangsa, represented by Azmin Ali of BERSATU, who is also the incumbent Minister of International Trade and Industry. The Ampang Jaya municipality however also covers the Pandan parliamentary constituency and the Hulu Klang state constituency within the Gombak parliamentary constituency. Transportation Car Effectively a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, Ampang is well connected to other places by a series of federal highways, tolled highways and state routes. Jalan Ampang is the main thoroughfare from downtown Kuala Lumpur until Taman Rimba Ampang. The AKLEH diverted some of the traffic from Jalan Ampang. The MRR2 runs through Ampang in a north‚Äìsouth orientation - this road is now the main route taken by Ampang motorists to get to either Pahang due north or Negeri Sembilan due south. The BESRAYA extension begins in Kampung Ampang Campuran, goes through Pandan Indah and all the way to Seri Kembangan. Besides that, there is a state-level hill road to Hulu Langat which serves as a shortcut to Kajang. Public transportation is the namesake and terminus of the Ampang Line, which is Malaysia's first LRT/metro system. The station, renovated in 2012, is located along Jalan Ampang. The stretch between Ampang and used to be part of KTM Intercity until the 1990s. KTM presently does not serve Ampang or its surroundings. Other than the aforementioned Ampang station, the Ampang Jaya municipal district is also served by the Cahaya, Cempaka, Pandan Indah and Pandan Jaya stations, all on the Ampang Line. The Cempaka-Pandan Jaya stretch is however not in Ampang proper, but located in the adjacent constituency of Pandan instead. According to unofficial proposals, a MRT Circle Line, surrounding downtown Kuala Lumpur would be built. Ampang station was reportedly one of the possible stops, along Abdullah Hukum, Bandar Malaysia, Segambut, Sentul Timur, Jelatek and Taman Midah. Besides the LRT, bus and taxi options are available. For example, rapidKL bus route 300 leads from the Ampang LRT station to KLCC.

Population: History Rudnya (as the settlement of Rodnya) is first mentioned in 1363 since the lands were occupied by Andrei of Polotsk and included in the Principality of Smolensk. During Polish rule it was part of the Vitebsk Voivodeship. After the First Partition of Poland in 1772 the area was included into newly established Babinovichsky Uyezd of Mogilev Governorate. In 1840, the uyezd was abolished and merged into Orshansky Uyezd of the same governorate. In 1919, Mogilev Governorate was abolished, and Orshansky Uyezd was included into Gomel Governorate. In 1920, the uyezd was included into Vitebsk Governorate, and shortly the area was transferred to Smolensky Uyezd of Smolensk Governorate. In 1926, Rudnya was granted the town status. On 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Rudnyansky District with the administrative center in Rudnya was established. The district belonged to Smolensk Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Rudnyansky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and September 1943, during World War II, the district was occupied by German troops. Rudnya is known as the maiden battle target of the famous Soviet multiple rocket launchers Katyusha. On July 14, 1941, an experimental artillery battery of seven launchers was first used in battle at Rudnya, under the command of Captain Ivan Flyorov, destroying a concentration of German troops with tanks, armored vehicles, and trucks at the marketplace, causing massive German Army casualties and its retreat from the town in panic. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Rudnya serves as the administrative center of Rudnyansky District.Resolution #261 As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Rudnyansky District as Rudnyanskoye Urban Settlement. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban settlement status and is a part of Rudnyansky Municipal District.Law #76-z Economy Industry 80% of the industrial production in Rudnyansky District is produced by food industry. There is also production of shoes and of doors and windows. Transportation The railway connecting Smolensk with Vitebsk and further with Daugavpils passes Rudnya. The R120 highway connecting Smolensk with the state border between Russia and Belarus, and continuing across the border to Vitebsk, passes Rudnya as well. The R130 highway connects Rudnya to Demidov. Culture and recreation Rudnya contains a number of protected cultural heritage monuments, including the monument to the first Katyusha rocket launcher military usage during World War II in Rudnya. In Rudnya, there is a history museum and a museum-house of Mikhail Yegorov. The latter is a subdivision of Smolensk State Museum Reserve. Yegorov, who was born close to Rudnya, was one of the two Soviet soldiers who raised a flag over the Reichstag on 2 May 1945, after the Battle of Berlin. Rudnya at one point had a Shtetl status, meaning that the village had a large concentration of Jews living in it. Jewish families first arrived after the Pale of Settlement was established in the western Russian Empire in 1791, granting Jews the legality to live in this settlement area. In 1926, there were 2235 Jews in Rudnya, nearly half of the village's population at the time. Many Jews in Rudnya moved to larger cities such as Leningrad and Smolensk in the early 1900s due to the newly established Communist driven industrial boom in larger cities. Of the nearly 2000 Jews who remained in the village during WWII, most were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust after a ghetto was established in Rudnya. Local Jews were shot to death in several murder operations between 1941 and 1943.http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=669 References Notes Sources  External links * The murder of the Jews of Rudnya during World War II, at Yad Vashem website.

Known as Chincoteague Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 13 (US 13) at Nash Corner east to Main Street in Chincoteague. SR 175 passes through the northeastern corner of Accomack County, providing the primary access to NASA's Wallops Flight Facility and both Chincoteague Island and the Virginia portion of Assateague Island. The route travels between the mainland and Chincoteague Island along the John B. Whealton Memorial Causeway. In 1928, SR 520 was designated to run from US 13 in Oak Hall east toward Chincoteague Island, being extended onto the island in 1930. The route was extended south along US 13 and west to a railroad crossing west of Oak Hall in 1930. SR 520 became SR 175 in the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering. SR 175 was extended south on Main Street in Chincoteague a year later and east on Beebe Road the following year, at which time a spur route known as SR 175Y was designated onto the northern portion of Main Street. The western terminus was moved to its current location in 1947, with the section west of US 13 becoming part of SR 703\\\\. SR 175 was routed to bypass Wallops Station to the south in 1954. In 1992, the section of SR 175 in Chincoteague, along with all of SR 175Y, was transferred to the secondary system. SR 175 was rerouted to bypass Marsh Island and a swing bridge over Chincoteague Channel with a new bascule bridge further north in 2010, tying into Main Street at Maddox Boulevard. The former swing bridge was demolished and a spur off the new bridge was built to serve Marsh Island. Route description View west along SR 175 in Wattsville SR 175 begins at an intersection with US 13 (Lankford Highway) at Nash Corner south of the Maryland state line. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road through a mix of farmland and woodland. Upon reaching the community of Wattsville, the highway intersects SR 679 (Fleming Road) and SR 798 (Mill Dam Road). The road crosses over Wallops Pond, an impoundment of Wattsville Branch of Mosquito Creek, onto Wallops Island. SR 175 heads east, intersecting SR 798 (Atlantic Avenue) again, then curves north through Wallops Island National Wildlife Refuge and around NASA's Wallops Flight Facility, a rocket launch site operated as a subsidiary of Goddard Space Flight Center. While heading north parallel to one of the flight facility's runways, the state highway passes the NASA Visitor Center. SR 175 curves to the east as it passes the main entrance to the flight facility. SR 175 heads east onto the John B. Whealton Memorial Causeway between the mainland and Chincoteague Island. The causeway passes over marshland adjacent to the southern end of Chincoteague Bay and includes bridges over Mosquito Creek, Cockle Creek, Queen Sound Channel, and Wire Narrows. A fifth bridge curves to the north and then east around the northern end of Marsh Island to cross Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel onto Chincoteague Island. The bridge has a bascule span over Chincoteague Channel and lands on Chincoteague Island north of the downtown area. Marsh Island is served by a connector bridge that meets SR 175 over Black Narrows. SR 175 reaches its eastern terminus at Main Street in the town of Chincoteague. The roadway continues east as Maddox Boulevard toward Assateague Island. SR 175 serves as the access road from US 13 to both Chincoteague and the Virginia section of Assateague Island. History The Whealton Memorial Causeway between the mainland and Chincoteague A causeway linking Chincoteague Island to the mainland was proposed by John B. Whealton, who formed the Chincoteague Toll Road and Bridge Company in 1919. On November 15, 1922, the causeway to Chincoteague Island was completed. Tolls were collected on the causeway until 1930. The road between US 13 in Oak Hall and Chincoteague Island became a part of the state highway system as SR 520 in August 1928. The route was extended onto Chincoteague Island in June 1930. In December of that year, SR 520 was extended south on US 13 and west along CR 107 to a railroad crossing west of Oak Hall. In the 1933 Virginia state highway renumbering, SR 520 was replaced with SR 175. In August 1934, SR 175 was extended south along Main Street in Chincoteague on the former SR 717. A year later, the route was extended east along Beebe Road to the boundary of Chincoteague. The western terminus of SR 175 was cut back to its current location at US 13 in June 1947, with an extension of SR 703 replacing the small section of the route that extended west from US 13. SR 175 was rerouted to bypass the Wallops Station facility to the south in May 1954; SR 798 was assigned to part of the former alignment. The SR 175 designation was removed from Main Street and Beebe Road in June 1992 when that stretch of road was transferred to the secondary system, leaving the eastern terminus at Main Street just east of the causeway onto the island. In January 2007, construction began to build a new bridge to Chincoteague Island for SR 175. This new crossing was built as the old bridges were narrow and deteriorating, in addition to reducing traffic congestion in downtown Chincoteague and providing a more direct route to the island's main commercial district and Assateague Island. The project constructed a bascule bridge over Black Narrows and Chincoteague Channel that would enter the island and terminate at Main Street and Maddox Boulevard, replacing the previous crossing by way of Marsh Island that consisted of a swing bridge over the Chincoteague Channel. A connector bridge was built to serve Marsh Island. SR 175 was relocated to the new bridge in October 2010\\\\. The old bridge over Black Narrows and the swing bridge over Chincoteague Channel were demolished following the completion of the new bridge. Major intersections SR 175Y State Route 175Y (SR 175Y) was an spur route of SR 175 in Chincoteague.

Reasons for power cycling include having an electronic device reinitialize its set of configuration parameters or recover from an unresponsive state of its mission critical functionality, such as in a crash or hang situation. Power cycling can also be used to reset network activity inside a modem. It can also be among the first steps for troubleshooting an issue. Overview Power cycling can be done manually, usually using a switch on the device to be cycled; automatically, through some type of device, system, or network management monitoring and control; or by remote control; through a communication channel. In the data center environment, remote control power cycling can usually be done through a power distribution unit, over TCP/IP. In the home environment, this can be done through home automation powerline communications or IP protocols. Most Internet Service Providers publish a \\"how-to\\" on their website showing their customers the correct procedure to power cycle their devices. Power cycling is a standard diagnostic procedure usually performed first when the computer freezes. However, frequently power cycling a computer can cause thermal stress. Reset has an equal effect on the software but may be less problematic for the hardware as power is not interrupted. Historical uses On all Apollo missions to the moon, the landing radar was required to acquire the surface before a landing could be attempted. But on Apollo 14, the landing radar was unable to lock on. Mission control told the astronauts to cycle the power. \\"108:08:42 Haise: Antares, Houston. We'd like you to cycle the Landing Radar (circuit) breaker.\\" They did, the radar locked on just in time, and the landing was completed. Page 247. During the Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov‚ÄìGerasimenko, the Philae lander did not return the expected telemetry on awakening after arrival at the comet. The problem was diagnosed as \\"somehow a glitch in the electronics\\", engineers cycled the power, and the lander awoke correctly. During the launch of the billion dollar AEHF-6 satellite on 26 March 2020 by an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, a hold was called at T-46 seconds due to hydraulic system not responding as expected.

Holy of Holies in the Salt Lake Temple, as it appeared in the early 1900s The domed ceiling of the Holy of Holies seen from above In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Holy of Holies is a room in the Salt Lake Temple wherein the church's president‚Äîacting as the Presiding High Priest of the church‚Äîenters to act as High Priest of Israel in direct relationship with God, in accordance with the LDS interpretation of the Book of Exodus.Buerger, David John.

Location and description The Holy of Holies is a room adjoining the celestial room of the Salt Lake Temple. The room is described in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism: \\"Beyond its sliding doors are six steps to similar doors, symbolic of the veil that guarded the Holy of Holies in ancient times. The sanctuary is of circular design with a domed ceiling. The appointments include inlaid wood, gold leaf, stained glass, and unique lighting.\\" The room includes a twelve-foot stained glass window, designed by the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company, depicting the First Vision of Joseph Smith.Joyce Athay Janetski, \\"Louis Comfort Tiffany: Stained Glass in Utah,\\" Utah Preservation/Restoration: A Publication for the Preservationist, vol. 3 (1981), pp. 20‚Äì25.Joyce Athay Janetski, \\"Stained Glass Windows: A Latter-day Saint Legacy\\", Ensign, January 1981, pp. 34‚Äì41.

Built in 1906, it extends from Main Street southward, across Riverside Drive, railroad tracks, and the Willimantic River, connecting downtown Willimantic to the residential area south of the river. It is one of a small number of pedestrian bridges built in the early 20th century to survive in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The north end of the Willimantic Footbridge is located near the eastern end of its downtown commercial district, between North and Church Streets on Main Street. The bridge is a five-span steel truss structure, about in length. The trusses are mainly mounted on steel trestle piers, although one is of granite rubblestone. The Main Street abutment is built out of ashlar granite blocks, while that on the south bank of the river is rubblestone. The trusses are all through trusses of three different types, with two heavy spans spanning the longest sections, across the river and the tracks of the Central Vermont Railroad. Lighter spans cross the Providence and Worcester Railroad tracks and Riverside Drive, with an even lighter span at the northernmost end. The bridge was built in 1906 to connect the commercial core to the southern residential part of Willimantic. A bridge was first proposed for this area in 1877, but no action was taken until the early 20th century, when city leaders were seeking to create a downtown area more suitable for pedestrian use. This bridge is a popular site in Willimantic. It is the only footbridge in New England to span both a river and a railroad.

This triangle is now the business hub of the community with shopping centers anchored by Publix and another anchored by Kroger. It also contains the Hickory Flat Public Library and the Sequoyah High School educational complex which includes feeder schools; Hickory Flat Elementary and Dean Rusk Middle School. History The community of Hickory Flat has a long history, dating to the period of frontier settlement of former Cherokee lands, associated with westward expansion and gold exploration in Georgia. The community is located along an old Native American trading route and is one of the county's earliest white settlements. To its north along the old Indian trail is a geographic feature known to locals as \\"Indian Knoll\\". This feature in the middle of rolling farm land is a small but prominent mound where it is believed that tribes would meet, during the time of the Cherokee A map of Georgia, from 1839, clearly indicates the community situated along what would eventually become Georgia State Route 140, between the city of Canton and the community of Social Hill. Begun in 1838, Hickory Flat Academy (now Hickory Flat Elementary) was the second school to be established in Cherokee County. Another nearby school can date its history to the later half of the 19th century. Nonetheless, the community remained small and rural well into the 21st century, when urban sprawl from the Atlanta MSA stimulated economic growth and the movement of large numbers of new residents to the area. The center of the community was for many years, and is still regarded today, as the four-way stoplight at the intersection of Georgia State Route 140 and East Cherokee Drive. A store and gas station, built there in the 1950s was, for generations of local residents, the focal point and meeting place for the community. The second floor of the store was originally used as a Masonic hall. The structure took on other functions in the late 20th century, and fell into disrepair by the early 21st century. When plans were announced to demolish the structure, and build a modern fast food outlet, The Cherokee County Historical Society sought to rally support for preservation and restoration of the dilapidated structure. However, the effort failed to gain sufficient traction, and the building was demolished to make way for a Chick- fil-A. Seeking to acknowledge the history and importance of the store's location, as a local gathering spot, the new Chick-fil-A included a \\"vintage- inspired\\" interior design, which features a large \\"gathering table\\" made from reclaimed wood.

Early life Collie was born in Insch in Aberdeenshire, Scotland on 2 June 1793 to Alexander and Christina Collie (n√©e Leslie). The youngest of three sons, Collie studied medicine in Edinburgh before moving to London to further his studies. In January 1813, he joined the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons and became an assistant surgeon in the navy. Career He sailed on the frigate to Tenerife, China and the East Indies, before returning to Europe to study botany, mineralogy and chemistry. In 1824 he was a surgeon on board and travelled to Africa, Brazil, Chile, the Sandwich Islands, California, Kamchatka Peninsula, Taiwan and Mexico. Collie was ship's surgeon on . This was part of the expeditionary group, including the barque Parmelia, which set out from Portsmouth in February 1829 to found the colony of Western Australia. While at sea on 16 April 1829 Collie assisted with the birth of Frederick Henry Stirling, the son of Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling and his wife Ellen. They arrived at Rottnest Island on 3 June 1829, upon which Collie started working in a hospital tent on Garden Island. He studied botany in his free time. He received of land on the banks of the Swan River. He and a Lieutenant Preston explored the south west of Western Australia, discovering two rivers that Lieutenant-Governor Stirling named after them: Collie River and Preston River. In 1830 he investigated the conditions on the Peel estate. He reported that the estate's manager, Thomas Peel, was incompetent, which led to government assistance for the settlers. In 1831, Collie was allotted of land in Albany, where he was appointed a Justice of the Peace and became the town's first government resident. Suffering from ill health he returned to Perth and was appointed the Swan River Colony's Colonial Surgeon from 1833 to 1835. His decision to return to England was made too late; although he had embarked on HMS Zebra, he died before the ship left Western Australian waters. He died in King George Sound on 8 November 1835 and was buried beside Mokare, his Aboriginal exploring companion. The graves of both Collie and Mokare were disturbed during the construction of the Albany Town Hall in 1887. Collie's remains were interred at Pioneer Cemetery in Albany. Legacy in Australia The town of Collie and Collie River are named in his honour in Western Australia, with a granite monolith erected for him in Collie.

DeLaMare J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1951; 73(2) pp 880‚Äì81; () :Kornblum‚ÄìDeLaMare rearrangement overview The base can be a hydroxide such as potassium hydroxide or an amine such as triethylamine. Reaction mechanism In the reaction mechanism for this organic reaction the base abstracts the acidic Œ±-proton of the peroxide 1 to form the carbanion 4 as a reactive intermediate which rearranges to the ketone 2 with expulsion of the hydroxyl anion 3'. This intermediate gains a proton forming the alcohol 3. :Kornblum-DeLaMare rearrangement Mechanism Deprotonation and rearrangement can also be a concerted reaction without formation of 4. An alternative reaction mechanism involving direct nucleophilic displacement on the peroxide link of the amine followed by an elimination reaction is considered unlikely based on the outcome of this model reaction:The mechanism of the tertiary amine catalysed isomerisation of endoperoxides to hydroxyketones: synthesis and chemistry of the intermediate postulated in the peroxide attack mechanism David R.

The reaction, formally a rearrangement, ranks under the elimination reactions as already observed by the original authors.

Related reactions The corresponding reaction involving an ether is the 1,2-Wittig rearrangement. The reaction course in this rearrangement is different because ether cleavage with carbanion formation is unfavorable.

It is located at 220-230 Brickell Avenue. In 1997 it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Building It is a two-story masonry vernacular building. It has brick detailing and brick columns in its front facade. The brick facade is unusual in south Florida, most buildings there are constructed of poured concrete or hollow clay tile. It is a rectangular building that faces west with five storefronts, separated by brick pilasters that have large plate glass windows. The upper floor has eight windows with brick framing resembling a simplified Greek key design. The first and second floor are divided by a cast stucco course with a projecting pediment, below which is an arched door. The south side of the building has four ground floor windows and two doorways the back one leading to a stairway to the second floor and the one on the southwest corner served as the entrance to offices. On this side the first and second floors are divided by a single band of raised brick. The upper story windows are detailed similarly to those on the west side. Primary access to the upper floors has been via a stairway inside the west-facing arched doorway. The upstairs floor and ceiling were constructed of Dade County Pine. History It was built by Thomas Bryan after the 1912 fire in downtown Fort Lauderdale and it is the least altered building of its era in the area. Thomas was the son of Nathaniel Bryan who supervised construction of the extension of Henry Flagler's Florida East Coast Railway from West Palm Beach to Miami. He was active in the development and city affairs of Fort Lauderdale and is his activities helped lead to the establishment of Broward County. The area the building is located in was Fort Lauderdale's original downtown commercial center. Usage The Post Office was located in the building from 1914 to 1925, about this time The Fort Lauderdale Bank also occupied the ground floor. From the 1920s to the early 1990s the second floor was a hotel or rooming house. Hotels in the building included the Hotel DeSoto (1919 to at least 1927), the Lee Hotel (1936-1938), the Hotel Boriss (1940‚Äì1946) and the Dorsey Hotel (1950‚Äì1965) a men-only hotel with a cowboy motif. The law offices of attorney and City Judge Ennis Shepherd occupied a portion of the ground floor from 1947 to the early 1900s. Read's Dry Goods where locals often purchased materials to make clothes, other dry goods merchants, beef purveyors, real estate offices and insurance agencies were among other tenants. Fort Lauderdale's downtown business district declined in the 1960s due to suburbanization. The building got a historically appropriate renovation about 1998. The renovation and application for designation as historic was part of a deal a local developer made allowing the demolition of another old local building, the Oliver Building.

On May 20, 1998, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The wood frame vernacular building was part of the Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale (NAS Ft Lauderdale). It was used to train torpedo bomber pilots during World War II using Link Trainer flight simulators. the building serves as the Naval Station Fort Lauderdale Museum. Building It was built in 1942. It is a one-story, split-level, wood frame vernacular building with wood walls and a tar and gravel roof that sat about above the ground on a foundation of concrete piers. The exterior is composition siding. The flat roof is built up on top of wood tongue and groove decking supported by wood joists. It is covered with tar and gravel. The roof overhang has a large fascia and a metal drip edge. It is long and feet wide and is composed of two wings. The building has approximately of floor space. The entrance, between the two wings has a small equipment room above it. This \\"penthouse\\" rises above and separates the taller left wing from the right. The front and back have grouped 1/1 light sashes as does the side of the tall wing. The side of the shorter wing has a pair of fixed windows with a center pane and two three pane side lights. The main entrance has double doors with a diamond shaped light in each. The building has three entrances with wood steps. The wood floor is tongue and groove decking on wood joists. In 1998 the original surfaces and materials had been obscured by alterations and the building was disused. Site The building was located at 4050 Southwest 14th Avenue in the former NAS Ft Lauderdale where it had been designated, \\"Building #8. At the end of 1999, the building, which weighs , was cut from the old foundation and jacked up hydraulically to be moved out of the airport and to its current location at 4000 West Perimeter Road in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It remains on the grounds of the Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood International Airport. World War II Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale was established on a civilian airport in 1942 to train torpedo bomber pilots for the Pacific theater in World War II. Training in the Link Trainer Building began on December 28, 1942. The air station made a significant contribution to the war effort with up to 3,600 personnel stationed there. The Link Trainers were early flight simulators used to teach \\"flying blind\\" or by instrument only. The student was in a dark compartment with instruments, gauges and controls. A linked map displayed the simulated results using a \\"bug\\". The building housed up to 6 Link Trainers which each student was trained on for four hours. Another four hours of video instruction was provided in Building #8. The aircraft they were training to fly was the Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber. Most airmen trained as NAS Fort Lauderdale were subsequently assigned to squadrons which flew the planes from aircraft carriers in the Pacific. Among them was the then 19 year‚Äìold Ensign George H. W. Bush, future United States President. The air station remained active for some time after the war until in 1948 it was declared surplus by the United States Navy. In stages the air station reverted to civilian control and ownership and Building #8 the Link Trainer Building became the property of Broward County. From a peak of 110 naval buildings during the war the remaining structures dwindled through the years. In 1978 about ten remained, in 1989 there were five. By 1998 the Naval Surface Weapons Center building had been demolished leaving only the Link Trainer Building. The NAS Fort Lauderdale had become the Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood International Airport. Modern times Vacant from 1945 to 1955 from then until 1980 it was leased for private offices. From 1981 to 1987 it was used as office space by consults involved in planning the expansion of the Fort Lauderdale‚ÄìHollywood International Airport. The Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Historical Association was active in fostering interest in the historic building and having it nominated to be added to the National Register of Historic Places. Founded in 1979 by WW II sailor Allan McElhiney the association first obtained a grant from the City of Fort Lauderdale to restore the interior of the building. In 1995 the Broward County Avaiation Department applied for a federal grant to restore and move the building. The grant became contingent on the building being listed as on the National Register of Historic Places. Eventually a grant from the United States Department of Transportation funding moving and refurbishing the building. Since being moved to its current location it has been operated as the Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Museum. The museum now has one Link Trainer on display. It was obtained by the museum in 2007 and restored the following year. The museum's displays include \\"The George Bush Room\\" a recreated soldier's barracks, \\"Broward Goes to War\\" and a memorial to Flight 19 a group Grumann Avengers flying out of NAS Fort Lauderdale whose disappearance is unexplained.

It is the world's biggest oil shale to energy company. The company was founded in 1939. As of 2014, it operates in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Jordan and Utah, United States. In Estonia the company operates under the name Eesti Energia, while using the brand name Enefit for international operations. The main raw material for energy production ‚Äì oil shale ‚Äì is extracted from mines located in Eastern-Estonia and owned by the company. The group of Eesti Energia has three main operation areas: electricity generation, shale oil production, and sale and distribution electricity. Its shares are owned by the Government of Estonia. History Elektrilevi service office in Kadaka, Tallinn. Eesti Energia was founded in 1939. In 1998, it was reorganized from the state enterprise to private limited company. In 1998‚Äì1999, two distribution companies (L√§√§nemaa Eletriv√µrk and Narva Elektriv√µrk) were separated from Eesti Energia and privatized. In 1995, the Government of Estonia started negotiations with NRG Energy, a subsidiary of Northern States Power Company, to create a joint venture on the basis of Narva Power Plants, a subsidiary of Eesti Energia. According to the basic terms of sale, agreed in 2000, NRG Energy was to acquire 49% stake in Narva Power Plants. In addition, at that time Narva Power Plants owned also 51% stake in the oil-shale mining company Eesti P√µlevkivi. The proposed deal got a strong public and political opposition. The deal was cancelled by the Government on 8 January 2002 after NRG Energy failed to secure financing for the deal by the agreed-upon deadline. On 21 August 2002 NRG Energy filed to the London court claiming ¬£100 million compensation for damages from the cancelled deal; however this claim was rejected. In 1999, Government handed 51% of shares of Eesti P√µlevkivi to Narva Elektrijaamad. In 2003, Government transferred remained 49% stake in Eesti P√µlevkivi to Eesti Energia. Also Narva Elektrijaamad-owned 51% stake was transferred to Eesti Energia and Eesti P√µlevkivi became a fully owned subsidiary of Eesti Energia. In 2000, Eesti Energia and Latvenergo announced a plan to merge companies to create a new Baltic Power Group. However, this deal was halted due to Latvian legislation forbidding privatization of Latvenergo and uncertainties around the NRG deal. In 2003, Eesti Energia tried to privatize Lithuanian distribution company RST. Although Eesti Energia fulfilled the privatization criteria and was the only bidder at the final stage of privatization, the privatization was halted by the Lithuanian Government. On 1 December 2005, during his visit to Estonia, Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas met with the CEO of Eesti Energia Sandor Liive to discuss Eesti Energia's participation in the proposed Visaginas Nuclear Power Plant project. On 8 March 2006, the heads of Lietuvos Energija, Eesti Energia and Latvenergo during their meeting in Ignalina signed a memorandum of understanding on the preparation for construction of a new nuclear reactor in Lithuania. Eesti Energia negotiated for six years; however, the project was put on hold after government change in Lithuania at the end of 2012. In 2006, Eesti Energia started to trade at Nord Pool Spot power exchange by acquiring Finnish trading company Solidus Oy. At the same year it started to sell electricity in Latvia and one year later in Lithuania. The company started its international oil shale activities in 2006. That year its subsidiary Oil Shale Energy of Jordan was created for the shale oil development project in Jordan. The memorandum of understanding between Eesti Energia and Government of Jordan was signed on 5 November 2006. The concession agreement was signed on 11 May 2010 in the presence of Jordanian and Estonian prime ministers Samir Zaid al-Rifai and Andrus Ansip. In March 2011, it acquired 100% shares of the Utah-based Oil Shale Exploration Company. To implement the EU 3rd energy package, on 28 August 2009 Government decided to separate and buy-out the transmission system operator Elering from Eesti Energia. The transaction was concluded on 28 January 2010. In 2010, the government considered the initial public offering of shares at the London Stock Exchange; however, this plan was postponed. On 29 May 2018 it was announced that Enefit Green, a renewable energy subsidiary of Eesti Energia, will acquire 100% of shares in the renewable energy company Nelja Energia for ‚Ç¨289 million. In addition, it will take over ‚Ç¨204 million of Nelja Energia loans. The deal was approved and completed in November 2018. Operations Eesti Energia produces and sells electricity, heat and fuel (oil shale and shale oil) and provides customer and consulting services. The company is engaged in the oil shale mining through its subsidiary Enefit Kaevandused, which extracts oil shale by opencast mining in the Narva quarry and by underground mining in the Estonia mine. Eesti Energia produces electrical power and heat in Narva Power Plants, which provides around 95% of the electrical energy consumed in Estonia and supplies the whole town of Narva with heat. For shale oil production, Eesti Energia operates the Narva Oil Plant, which uses a Galoter-type solid heat carrier technology process. The plant operates two Enefit-140 shale oil units. The plant produces about 1.4 million tonnes of shale oil per year. As of 2013, the new-generation Enefit280 plant is in hot-commissioning process. International activities In Jordan, its subsidiary Jordan Oil Shale Energy Company is preparing construction of a shale oil plant with capacity of . The shale oil plant will use the Enefit processing technology; construction is slated to begin by 2015. Its another subsidiary in Jordan, Attarat Power Company, is planning to build a 460 MW oil-shale-fired power plant at Attarat Umm Ghudran. The power station is expected to be operational by 2016.

Members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), a loyalist paramilitary group, shot dead three civilians and a Provisional Irish Republican Army volunteer as they arrived for work. Another was wounded. The men were all Catholics. The five men were builders and had been renovating houses in the Gortree Park housing estate for some months. As they arrived in their van at Gortree Park, at least two gunmen jumped out of another van and opened fire. Those killed were James McKenna (52), Gerard Dalrymple (58), Noel O'Kane (20) and Provisional IRA volunteer James Kelly (25). The gunmen drove off toward Castlerock before doing a U-turn and passing their victims again. The van used by the gunmen was found burnt- out two miles from the attack. Later in the day, the UDA shot dead a Catholic civilian and wounded another at Dairy Farm Shopping Centre in Belfast. The UDA claimed responsibility for the attack using the covername \\"Ulster Freedom Fighters\\" (UFF) and said the men were republicans. Sinn F√©in councillor Patsy Groogan said the men were regularly stopped and harassed by the security forces and that he had \\"no doubt that this behaviour played a part in targeting these men for assassination\\".

The organization was informally known as \\"the Mobe\\". April 15, 1967 Anti-Vietnam war demonstrations On April 15, 1967, the Spring Mobilization's massive march against the Vietnam War from Central Park to the United Nations attracted hundreds of thousands of people, including Martin Luther King Jr., Harry Belafonte, James Bevel, and Dr. Benjamin Spock, who marched and spoke at the event. During the event many draft cards were burned, according to the New York Times.\\"Many Draft Cards Burned - Eggs Tossed at Parade.\\" New York Times, April 16, 1967, p. 1,38 A simultaneous march in San Francisco was attended by Coretta Scott King. At the New York march its last speaker, James Bevel, the Spring Mobilization's chairman and initiator of the march on the U.N. (until Bevel came aboard at the invitation of A. J. Muste and David Dellinger the plan was for just an April 15 rally in Central Park), made an impromptu announcement that the next major anti-war gathering would be in Washington D.C.\\"James L.

The Mobe then planned and organized a large demonstration for Washington D.C. on October 21, 1967. This demonstration was a rally at West Potomac Park near the Lincoln Memorial and a march to the Pentagon, where another rally would be held in a parking lot, followed by civil disobedience on the steps of the Pentagon itself. The action was known as the \\"March on the Pentagon.\\" Hoping to attract young, educated college students, Mobe coordinator David Dellinger appointed Jerry Rubin, who led the large Vietnam Day Committee at the University of California, Berkeley,Levitate the Pentagon to organize the march. The initial D.C. rally, which was galvanized by a concert performance from counterculture folk singer Phil Ochs, drew approximately 70,000 participants at the Lincoln Memorial. Following Ochs' concert, as well as speeches from Dellinger and Dr. Spock,The Day The Pentagon Was Supposed To Lift Off Into Space around 50,000 of those attending were then led by social activist Abbie Hoffman and marched from the Lincoln Memorial to The Pentagon in nearby Arlington, Virginia to participate in a second rally. About 650 people, including novelist Norman Mailer, were arrested for civil disobedience on the steps of the Pentagon. A few individuals such as Allen Ginsberg, Ed Sanders, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin (Hoffman and Rubin would co-found the Yippies later in '67) attempted by means of meditation and chanting to \\"levitate\\" the building and \\"exorcise the evil within.\\" These events were chronicled by Norman Mailer in his non-fiction novel The Armies of the Night. 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention Demonstrations Following the Pentagon demonstration, the Mobe began discussion and planning for demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, to be held in Chicago, where President Lyndon B. Johnson was expected to be nominated for a second term. Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis were the key Mobe organizers for the Chicago demonstration, and would later be indicted for conspiracy and inciting a riot as members of the Chicago Seven. The Chicago demonstrations drew only 10,000 participants because it was widely anticipated that the mayor of Chicago, Richard J. Daley, would deploy his police to prevent marches to the site of the Convention. Norman Mailer wrote a non-fiction novel about both the 1968 Democratic and Republican Conventions entitled Miami and the Siege of Chicago. Further activity Following the election of Richard M. Nixon, the Mobe organized a \\"counter-inaugural\\" to take place in Washington D.C. on the day of Nixon's inauguration. This demonstration also attracted about 10,000 people and was accompanied by street violence. The National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam then disbanded. Future national marches against the Vietnam war would be organized by other groups. The similarly named and inspired New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (New Mobe) was founded at a conference at Case Western Reserve University in July 1969, and, together with the Vietnam Moratorium Committee and the Student Mobilization Committee (SMC), organized the October 15, 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam which resulted in large demonstrations against the Vietnam War held nationwide.Newsweek Magazine, October 27, 1969 The groups then organized another large demonstration in Washington D.C. to occur a month later, on November 15, 1969, which was also attended by a large crowd.

Dawson's Book Shop, Los Angeles. Life Sales was born in Valencia, Spain in 1745. He was with the initial group of Dominican missionaries who took over responsibility for the Baja California missions in 1773 from the Franciscans, who in turn had replaced the expelled Jesuits in 1768. Sales apparently served at the missions of El Rosario, San Vicente, and San Miguel. In 1790 he received permission to return to Valencia where he died in 1807. Sales wrote three letters to an anonymous friend in Valencia while he was serving at San Miguel and during his voyage home. The first provided a brief geographical description of the peninsula and then discussed in detail the customs and character of the Indians on its northwestern frontier, particularly regarding the Kiliwa and Paipai. The second letter continued the discussion of ethnography and related the history of Spanish involvement, including a lengthy digression on the Nootka Crisis. The third letter discussed the Dominican role in Baja California. Sales' view of the native peoples was often strongly negative, recalling the acerbity of the Jesuit Johann Jakob Baegert. However, Sales provided indispensable information about traditional subsistence activities, religion, and many other matters.

He carried the Golden Howdah for a record 18 years consecutive years between 1981 and 1997, before being electrocuted while grazing in 1998. Of all the carrier elephants since the 20th-century, he is considered the best \\"because he possessed an excellent ability to learn and correct himself\\". The name The elephant was named after Drona, the great guru of Mahabharata. In the epic, Dronacharya is a priest, but he was so mature and intelligent that he taught warfare for a livelihood. The elephant Drona was named so because of his amazing ability to learn and correct himself. History Drona was captured in a khedda operation in the Kakanakote forest area of Heggadadevana kote in 1971. He was used for a brief period in Shimoga to carry timber. Doddappaji was Drona's mahout. Doddappaji's association with Drona began from the day it was captured, as his father, Chennakeshavaiah, was in charge of taming it. Having grown up together, he understood the animal better than anyone else. The Mahout Doddappaji, who once handled Drona, the elephant that carried the howdah, has refused to take part in the Dasara festivities since Drona was electrocuted. A third generation mahout and an expert in taming wild elephants, Doddappaji is haunted by memories of Drona. After the death of Drona, he has requested senior officials not to ask him to participate in the \\"Jamboo Savari.\\" The mahout says he has not come across another elephant that matches the size and strength of Drona, whom people adored for his gentle behaviour. Death Drona died of electrocution in 1998, when he was grazing in the Nagarhole National Park, that spans across the borders of Kodagu and Mysore districts of Karnataka. In a village, Balle, attempting to eat the leaves from a tree, he pulled down the trunk, which brought down a high-tension power cable and instantly electrocuted him. Following his death, Drona was mourned in Karnataka. Trivia * Drona attained celebrity status in Karnataka for its majestic gait, grace and timid behaviour. * The elephant was very sensitive, he just wouldn‚Äôt relish the idea of anybody other than his mahout sitting atop him. Drona would shrug and shake his back, if any of us ‚Äòlesser mortals‚Äô tried hitching a ride. * Drona had amazing ability to learn and correct himself. When the Golden Howdah shifted left or right during the procession, Drona could move his muscles selectively and stabilize the weight. His trainers were very surprised because they had not trained Drona in this skill. * Drona also practiced energy conservation techniques, he would walk slow early in the procession to conserve energy. * Drona had rigid eating habits, he was very particular about his diet, and always ate in solitude. * Drona's Mahout did not wear slippers while mounting the animal as it was considered sacred. * Drona had a perfect curve on its back to carry the 750 kg howdah.

High Street is one of the main thoroughfares and shopping areas in the city centre of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, England, located at the approximate grid reference of . High Street starts at the Commercial Street, Fitzalan Square and Haymarket junction and runs for approximately 400 metres west to conclude near the Sheffield Cathedral where it forms a Y-junction with Fargate and Church Street. High Street has the traditional wide variety of shops, financial institutions and eating places which are associated with any British town centre. History Early history High Street has existed for as long as Sheffield has been a settlement of any importance. The first documented mention was in the 12th century when it was written that Worksop Priory owned five principal properties on the north side of High Street. The connection between Sheffield and Worksop Priory comes from William de Lovetot, lord of Hallamshire, who founded the Priory in 1103. These strong connections gave High Street the alternative name of Prior Gate as late as the 18th century. Sheffield's first Master Cutler Robert Sorsby bought a house on the south side of High Street in 1611 and had completely rebuilt it by the time he took office in 1624. In 1637 High Street had eleven shops at the entrance to the churchyard, these were an overspill from the Tuesday and Thursday markets in Market Place. Another Master Cutler, Christopher Broomhead, who took office in 1696 had a house in Prior Row. Towards the end of the 17th century, High Street had some of the best houses in town with many being rebuilt in stone with slate roofs.\\"The Story of Sheffield High Street\\", Pat Dallman, Gives history and architecture. The former London and Midland Banking Company building on the corner with York Street. High Street was the site of the original Sheffield Town Hall, which was situated by the church gates; it was a modest building which was replaced by a more impressive structure in 1808 on Waingate. For many years High Street remained no wider than it had been in the Middle Ages; it was too narrow for horse trams to pass through. It had the timber framed bailiff's house (built in 1574) on its south side right up to the end of the 19th century. Victorian improvement Plans were first put forward to widen High Street by the local council in 1875 but work did not start until 1895 due to objections from shopkeepers and wranglings over compensation and property boundaries. Between 1883 and 1885 Parade Chambers was built on the north side of High Street (at the corner with East Parade). It was designed by Charles Hadfield in the Tudor Gothic Style and is regarded as one of the best examples of architecture in the city centre; the notable stone carving is by Frank Tory.Public Art Research Archive, Sheffield Hallam University. Details Frank Tory senior work on Parade Chambers. Also part of this block on the corner of York Street are the former bank buildings, these were erected in 1895 by Holmes and Watson for the London and Midland Banking Company. It is built of Huddersfield stone with Labrador and Swedish granite used for the base and pilasters, there is much Renaissance detail on the front of the building.\\"Pevsner Architectural Guides - Sheffield\\", Ruth Harman & John Minnis, Gives architectural information.\\"Central Sheffield\\", Martin Olive, Gives historical information. High Street was doubled in width by the 1895 improvement work as all the old buildings on the south side of the street were demolished and replaced by more elegant structures. These included the Foster‚Äôs Buildings near the junction with Fargate, built in the French domestic Gothic style by Flockton, Gibbs & Flockton for a Gentlemen‚Äôs outfitters shop with four floors of offices above. The upper floors were reached by an American elevator, the first one in Sheffield. Also amongst the new buildings on the south side was the original John Walsh department store, which opened in 1900. The store later became Rackhams and then House of Fraser and at its peak had over 600 employees before being destroyed in the Second World War. Kemsley House designed by Gibbs, Flockton & Teather is a grade two listed building better known as the Star and Telegraph building it was opened on the north side of High Street in 1913 and is named after Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley, the newspaper proprietor. It now houses the headquarters of the Sheffield Star newspaper (although the entrance is on York Street) and with its white brickwork and elegant clock tower it is a familiar landmark. During the demolition of old shops to make way for Kemsley House a hoard of old gold and silver coins was discovered behind a cellar wall. The coins dated from 1547 to 1625; a silver pendant was also found with the coins.\\"A History of Sheffield\\", David Hey, Gives historical information. Second World War High Street suffered badly as a result of the Sheffield Blitz in December 1940 when many of the high Victorian buildings on the south side of the street were devastated by German bombing. These were the newer buildings which had appeared as a result of the road widening at the end of the 19th century. All of the older shops on the northern side were spared by the bombing. Buildings which were destroyed in the Blitz included the Marples Hotel (on the corner with Fitzalan Square) where 70 people lost their lives. The C&A; Modes store was hit by three bombs and gutted, while Walsh's department store, the Grand Clothing Hall and the Westminster Hotel were all destroyed. The Foster‚Äòs Buildings, constructed in Huddersfield Stone has impressive pinnacles and parapets . Post-war Post-war rebuilding of the damaged High Street was slow; it was not until 1951 that the damaged Walsh's store was demolished with a new store designed by JS Beaumont and built by George Longden Ltd., opening on 13 May 1953. A new Marples Hotel opened in 1959 while C&A; Modes also rebuilt their store, although the building is now occupied by a hotel. The early 1960s saw a radical change to High Street's junction with Angel Street when a decision was taken to give cars easier access to the city centre. This involved the creation of Arundel Gate, a dual carriageway which approached from the south and met the High Street / Angel Street junction at a roundabout. These changes resulted in the demolition of Change Alley, an ancient thoroughfare which ran between High Street and Norfolk Street and had had timber framed houses on it many years previously.\\"A Tale of Two Cities\\", Ian R. Taylor, Karen Evans, Penny Fraser, Routledge, Google Books online, Gives information on post war development. The changes made by the construction of Arundel Gate included the building of a network of underground walkways which linked Arundel Gate, Commercial Street, Snig Hill and Fitzalan Square. High Street was located at the head of this network with escalators taking pedestrians into the subways. It was known officially as Castle Square but acquired the nickname locally as 'The Hole In The Road' which boasted a large central open air circle with entrances to many stores, convenient newsagents, a bus enquiry centre and even a tropical fish tank stocked with mature fish. The \\"Hole in the Road\\" subterranean system was opened on 27 November 1967, however, the walkways fell into disrepair during the early 1990s and were finally closed to the public on 10 January 1994. The \\"Hole in the Road\\" network was filled in with rubble from the Hyde Park flats and re- developed as part of the Sheffield Supertram system. Present day For part of its length High Street carries the A621 road before it swings south down Arundel Gate. The South Yorkshire Supertram system was completed in early 1995 and runs along High Street in its own reserved half of the road. The other half is a one way system for regular traffic travelling west; there is a tram stop midway along known as Castle Square.

In the 1960s, Smith was the lead vocalist and keyboard player for the Dave Clark Five. The band was a leading unit in the British Invasion of the United States, and were the Beatles' main British rivals before the emergence of the Rolling Stones. Biography Smith was born in Edmonton, Middlesex (now part of north London), an only child of George and Maud Smith. His parents found he had a natural ability as a pianist that surfaced as early as age five. Smith started lessons in classical piano, and at age 13 passed the entrance exams at Trinity Music College in London. Career Smith first met Dave Clark when they were both members on the same football team for the St. George Boys Club. By his mid-teens, Smith had developed a strong vocal delivery, while idolising Little Richard, among other American rock & roll stars. At age 17, while working for a finance company, Smith was invited by Clark to join his band, which was busy rebuilding itself around the core of Clark and rhythm guitarist (later bassist) Rick Huxley, after having recently lost its lead singer. Dave Clark Five Dave Clark Five The Ed Sullivan Show appearance, 1966. From left: Denis Payton, Dave Clark, Mike Smith, Rick Huxley and Lenny Davidson. With Smith on vocals, piano or organ (and occasionally playing guitar in later years), the new Dave Clark Five was completed with the additions of saxophonist Denis (Denny) Payton and lead guitarist Lenny Davidson, who was auditioned on Smith's recommendation. Smith made his recording debut, at age 18, with the single \\"I Knew It All the Time\\" b/w (flip side) \\"That's What I Said\\" produced by Pye Records in June 1962 and credited to the unknown band The Dave Clark Five featuring Mike Smith. Performed in a style midway between early British beat and the bolder 1960s sounds that were developing, it was a powerful record to be issued while the Beatles were still developing their first recording deal. Due to his role as lead singer, Smith was considered the other star of the band, less visible by name than drummer/founder Clark but still at the centre of the group's sound as lead singer and keyboard player. \\"Mike Smith: Information from Answers.com\\" (biography), Answers Corporation, 2006, webpage: AnswersCom-Mike- Smith. Smith's singing showed the strong influence of Elvis Presley during the period of \\"The Girl of My Best Friend\\", \\"(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame\\", and \\"Little Sister\\". Due to his lead singing, Mike was very popular around the world on DC5 concert tours, especially in the Philippines. The rock band was so much welcomed at their performance at Smart Araneta Coliseum on 23‚Äì26 April 1965. Filipinos loved his rendition of hits Because and Hurting Inside. Smith's rich and raspy baritone voice and keyboards were clearly evident in the band‚Äôs sound over seven years: during their two major years of success in 1964‚Äì1965 and continuing five years after the British Invasion died down in America, until the group disbanded in 1970. Clark & Smith Smith continued working with Clark until 1973, mainly to help the drummer/bandleader fulfill contractual commitments, as \\"Dave Clark & Friends\\". Smith & Clark released cover versions of popular hits such as \\"Rub It In\\", \\"Sweet City Woman\\", and \\"Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)\\". \\"OVER AND OVER ?

Producer In 1976, Mike recorded an album with former Manfred Mann singer Michael d'Abo. Most of Smith's work in the 1970s and 1980s, however, was as a producer and songwriter, and Smith was successful working on commercials (commercial ads), authoring jingles for many products. Mike Smith's Rock Engine Smith returned to performing in the late 1990s, and discovered he still had many fans on the oldies circuit. Having moved to Spain, Smith had met four musicians who shared his dedication to playing for fun above all else: lead guitarist Doug Lean; bassist Curt Sandell; drummer Paul Skelton; and saxophone player Frank Mead. \\"DAVE CLARK FIVE SINGER-SONGWRITER MIKE SMITH TO LAUNCH FIRST U.S. TOUR...\\" (bio), The Regent Theatre, Arlington, MA, 2003-01-28, webpage: Regent-Mike-Smith-Tour. After rehearsing at each other‚Äôs houses on the Costa del Sol, the group made their concert debut in August 2002, when they played a benefit for a charity of abused children and raised $100,000. Beginning in March 2003, Mike Smith's Rock Engine occasional tours generated very enthusiastic responses from audiences, despite being prevented from mentioning the Dave Clark Five in his advertising, Smith appeared to be emerging as a popular star in his own right. Later life Mike Smith was divorced from his first wife Jill Smith, a former horse trainer who became a celebrity hairdresser. They had one son, James. Mike lived with his longtime partner, Jane Geerts, for 18 years between 1980 and 1998. In October 2001 Mike married \\"Charlie\\" (real name: Arlene Gorek), with whom he had re-established contact in 1999, having dated 35 years earlier. On 1 June 2003, James, then a 24-year-old professional diver, died in a diving accident in the Red Sea. James never surfaced after making the dive. Smith established a memorial to his son at Egypt's Blue Hole, a popular diving location, with a plaque reading, \\"Don‚Äôt let fear stand in the way of your dreams.\\" Three months later, on 13 September 2003, nearing his 60th birthday, Smith was injured in an accident in his home in Spain which severely damaged his spinal cord. He tried to climb a 7 ft gate after locking himself out of his villa, fell heavily, and landed on his head. His spine fractured in three places leaving him permanently paralyzed from the waist down and in his right arm, with very little movement in his left arm. Following four years of treatment, Smith was released from hospital on his 64th birthday, 6 December 2007. On 19 December 2007, Bruce Springsteen, a longtime friend and fan, dedicated \\"Born to Run\\" to Smith and his wife, Charlie, who were attending his concert at the O2 in London.BCconcert Death Smith died on 28 February 2008 at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, at the age of 64, of pneumonia, a complication from his earlier accident.Dave Clark Five Singer Mike Smith Dies, Days Before Induction into Rock Hall He died 11 days before he was to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Dave Clark Five.

They sold more than 100 million records, sold out five consecutive world tours and six in the U.S. including 12 consecutive shows at Carnegie Hall, and made a record-setting 18 appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show (New York City). When the DC5 disbanded, Smith first collaborated with singer Mike D‚ÄôAbo, former lead singer of Manfred Mann. They made one self-titled album, which has recently been reissued by Sony in Japan. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice recruited Mike Smith to sing on the recording of their Evita before it ever hit the stage, earning him another gold record. Smith also produced recordings for Shirley Bassey and four gold albums for one of Europe‚Äôs top male vocalists, Michael Ball. Smith can be heard in the Applebee‚Äôs Restaurant commercial that uses \\"I Like It Like That\\" and in Target‚Äôs campaign, which uses \\"Bits and Pieces\\" : one of dozens of commercials he has made over the years, employing his distinctive \\"Smith sound.\\" He also taped an interview and performance for a TV special on \\"The British Music Invasion\\" which aired in the U.S. on TLC in 2003.

Football career The son of Spanish immigrants, Copado began his football career in his hometown of Kiel, initially at Eintracht Kiel and later with Holstein Kiel, where he came through the youth ranks. For the 1992‚Äì93 season he received a professional contract from Hamburger SV, whose scouts had been keeping a close eye on the young offensive player. From 1993 to 1995 Copado played in three Bundesliga matches, the first on 20 November 1993 as a late substitute in a 0‚Äì3 away loss against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In 1995‚Äì96 he amassed a further ten appearances under Felix Magath, before leaving the club in the winter transfer window. Copado subsequently moved to Spain, joining Segunda Divisi√≥n team RCD Mallorca in January 1996. In his first full season he contributed two goals in 30 games (his first in a 1‚Äì0 win at Real Madrid Castilla), helping win promotion to La Liga. However, Copado would never play in Spain's top level, as he left in July 1997 and joined lower league side Tennis Borussia Berlin ‚Äì there, he played under Hermann Gerland, the manager mostly associated with the player's explosion. He ended the season with 12 goals as TeBe was unbeaten and became Regionalliga Nord champions; in the 2. Bundesliga, he would only score six goals in the following two seasons combined. For the 2000‚Äì01 campaign top division club SpVgg Unterhaching bought Copado, at the express petition of club manager Lorenz-G√ºnther K√∂stner. However, after a few games, the player failed to produce on the pitch (including training), while also gaining a reputation for excessive partying. Therefore, he was suspended for ten months due to disciplinary reasons ‚Äì during this time, he was forced to train on his own, and only when K√∂stner was fired on 13 September 2001 (with the club previously having been relegated) did the situation clear; Rainer Adrion took over the ruins and the player was forgiven, but Unterhaching dropped another level. Under Wolfgang Frank, who made him team captain, Copado netted an incredible 58 league goals in three seasons (being instrumental in the side's return to the second level in 2003), operating as both forward and midfielder. Due to those solid performances, the 31-year-old returned to the top flight for the third time in his career, joining Eintracht Frankfurt on a three-year contract. Copado eventually broke into the first team after early difficulties, scoring six goals during the season ‚Äì in December 2005 he was even awarded the Player of the Month award. However, he only managed one goal in his 14 last appearances, losing the confidence of manager Friedhelm Funkel and subsequently being sold in the following transfer window (although he still appeared in the first match of 2006‚Äì07). Copado joined TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on 30 August 2006, being a crucial offensive element in the club's rise from the third (Regionalliga S√ºd) to the first level in just two seasons (14 goals in his first year, ten in the second). He appeared sparingly during the campaign's first half, managing to score a penalty in Hoffenheim's 3‚Äì0 home win over Arminia Bielefeld on 29 November 2008. On 16 December he was released from contract, returning to former side Unterhaching and retiring on 31 March 2009, having played his last game the previous day. From 2012 onwards Copado continued working with Unterhaching, as director of football and youth and assistant manager. Personal life Copado is the brother-in-law of Hasan Salihamid≈æiƒá, to whom his sister married. During his playing days at Mallorca, he was often referred to as Paco. Copado married Eva Schrobenhauser, daughter of former side Unterhaching's owner Anton Schrobenhauser.

The next and last official coinage of the Hawaiian Islands was minted in 1883, by King KalƒÅkaua I; however during the intervening period, the changing needs of the Hawaiian Islands were met by circulating private-issued tokens and the coins of the United States of America. The following is a list of known coins and tokens issued by the Kingdom of Hawai ªi and various business concerns during the period of 1847 through 1891. The referenced catalog numbers used in this article are from the book, Hawaiian Money: Standard Catalog: Second Edition, 1991 by Donald Medcalf and Ronald Russell.Medcalf, Donald & Ronald Russell (1991). Hawaiian Money: Standard Catalog: Second Edition. Honolulu: Nani Stamp & Coin LTD. Kingdom of the Hawaiian Islands 1847 Kamehaheha III issue Background Keneta The ill-fated Keneta was commissioned by King Kamehameha III. Coined money was in great demand in the Hawaiian Islands and was in continual shortage in the early nineteenth century. In response, King Kamehameha III devoted Chapter 4, Section 1 of the legal code of 1846 to the monetary system of the kingdom, tying it directly to that of the United States, thus normalizing the rate of transaction of small change in the islands and their corresponding values to United States money. Anticipating growing coined money needs, the legal code also outlined future Hawaiian coin designs. Of the first coins decided to be acted upon was the Keneta‚Äîa copper coin valued at one cent of a U.S. dollar. As the Hawaiian Treasury was in shortage of funds during this period, the copper cent was seen as an initial \\"affordable\\" issue to be followed by other denominations at a later date. James Jackson Jarves, acting as agent for the Hawaiian Government, placed an order for 100,000 of these coins in 1846. He contracted Edward Hulseman‚Äîbest known for his 1837 Half Cent token‚Äîto design and engrave the coin. It is not known precisely where the pieces were minted ‚Äì although Walter Breen in Complete Encyclopedia of U.S. and Colonial Coins asserts that they were produced at the private mint of H. M. & E. I. Richards of Attleboro, Massachusetts; regardless, Jarves was given a note dated January 14, 1847 in the amount of $869.56 by the Minister of Finance as payment for the order. On 3 May 1847 the merchant ship Montreal arrived in Honolulu after sailing from Boston via Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn and Tahiti. The Keneta were part of the cargo delivered to the Minister of Finance. When the coins reached the public they proved a grave disappointment. There has been some claim that the denomination was misspelled \\"Hapa Haneri\\" instead of the correct \\"Hapa Hanele\\" (which translates to \\"part of a hundred\\" or loosely \\"one cent\\"). However, \\"Hapa Hanele\\" is a 20th-century spelling. The spelling \\"Haneri\\" was used throughout the 19th century, and also appears on the $100 and $500 bills issued during the reign of King Kalakaua. Reports of the time state that the King's portrait was unrecognizable. In addition, the Keneta also arrived worn or discolored by the humidity and bilge water of the Montreal, in whose hold they had spent many months. Local merchants, who were \\"against very small transactions,\\" immediately voiced their objections to the coins; and the only general usage witnessed was by governors of the outer islands who used them as change when collecting duties and taxes. The last known time of issue for the Keneta was in 1862, when 11,595 were still being held in the Treasury vault. Their legal tender status was removed in 1884, and in the following year 88,305 were sold as scrap and shipped out of the country. The Keneta is about the same size as the United States Large Cent. The coin bears a bust of the king on the obverse surrounded by the legend \\"KAMEHAMEHA III. KA MOI.\\" and the date 1847 below. The reverse has \\"HAPA HANERI\\" within a leafy wreath, tied with a bow at bottom, surrounded by \\"AUPUNI HAWAII.\\" There are two different obverse varieties: one shows a Plain 4 in the date, while the other has a \\"Crosslet\\" 4 (with a vertical bar at the right end of the horizontal line). The Plain 4 is commonly known as the \\"Small Bust\\" type, while the Crosslet 4 is called the \\"Large Bust.\\" There are also six separate varieties of reverse dies with the wreath displaying 13, 15, 17 or 18 berries, with 2CC-6 being the rarest followed by 2CC-1.

These officials suggested that a national coinage be issued for his island kingdom. King KalƒÅkaua I was pleased with the idea of independent coinage for his Kingdom that he ordered patterns for the new coin to be struck. Coins of Hawaii Subject Talk by Numismatist, Honolulu Star Bulletin, March, 1914 A spelling mistake by the engraver substituted the word \\"Au\\" for \\"Ua\\" in the Kingdom of Hawai ªi motto Ua Mau ke Ea o ka  ªƒÄina i ka Pono. 200 patterns with King KalƒÅkaua I in profile were minted in Paris and forwarded to the king upon his return to his island kingdom. The subjects of the Kingdom of Hawaii did not approve of the new coin due to the misspelling of the Kingdom's motto. Many of these coins were subsequently destroyed or distributed among the friends of the king.

Waterhouse Background John Thomas Waterhouse Token The Waterhouse token is struck in white metal - a substance similar to pewter or plumbers putty. It is recognized as the earliest known Hawaiian token; although the use of the token and the date of issue is unclear. The firm of J. T. Waterhouse, established in 1851, were importers of dry goods in the 19th century; the firm is still active in several business enterprises today. The obverse features a facing bust of Kamehameha III, though with the surrounding legend reading \\"HIS MAJESTY KAMEHAMEHA IV\\". The reverse shows a beehive in the center with the issuer's name at top and \\"HALE MAIKAI\\" - meaning house excellent, or a good place to do business - below. The token was known as hale meli in Hawaiian, recalling the beehive on the reverse.

History 1859‚Äì1914 18th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (London Irish), c1895 The London Irish Rifles was originally formed in 1859 during the Victorian Volunteer Movement and named 28th Middlesex (London Irish) Rifle Volunteer Corps. During the Second Boer War, the battalion sent eight officers and 208 private soldiers for active service. Captain EG Concannon won the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In recognition of their service, the London Irish was granted their first battle honour, \\"South Africa, 1900-1902\\". In 1908, the London Irish was transferred to the Territorial Force and renamed the 18th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment (London Irish Rifles). First World War The 1st battalion was mobilised in August 1914, at the start of the First World War at the Duke of York's Headquarters. It landed at Le Havre as part of the 5th London Brigade in the 2nd London Division. The 2nd battalion landed in France in June 1916 in the 180th Brigade in the 60th (2/2nd London) Division. The 2nd battalion served on the Salonika front from December 1916 to June 1917 and then join the Egyptian Expeditionary Force for the advance to Jericho. At the Battle of Loos, the 1st Battalion LIR particularly distinguished itself. While storming across No-Man's Land to capture the enemy trenches, Rifleman Frank Edwards, the Captain of the football team, kicked a football along in front of the troops as they approached the German lines. Some 1,016 London Irishmen were killed during the conflict. Inter-war Cap badge variations between WW1 (Left) and WW2 (Right) After the cessation of hostilities, the LIR was reduced to cadre strength, before being disbanded in May 1919 at Felixstowe. In February 1920, the 18th (County of London) Battalion of the London Regiment (London Irish Rifles) was reconstituted as a component of the 47th (2nd London) Infantry Division of the new Territorial Army, and in 1923, the designation of the Regiment was shortened to 18th London Regiment (London Irish Rifles). In 1937, when the London Regiment was disbanded, the unit became known as London Irish Rifles, the Royal Ulster Rifles. After the 47th Division was also disbanded, the London Irish transferred to the 169th (3rd London) Infantry Brigade, part of 56th (1st London) Infantry Division. Second World War In April 1939, the establishment of the Territorial Army (TA), the British Army's part-time reserve, was doubled in size and the 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles was reformed, initially as a component unit of the 4th London Infantry Brigade, part of the 2nd London Infantry Division which was a 2nd Line duplicate of the 1st Line 1st London Infantry Division.Joslen, p. 235 The Pipe Band of the London Irish Rifles on parade with their Irish Wolfhound mascot, near Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, 31 December 1940. The 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion, a Young Soldiers unit of the London Irish Rifles, was also formed, early in 1940, and set up for young men volunteering who were between the ages of eighteen and nineteen and a half. The objective of the battalion was to train the soldiers to the highest standard of drill, skill-at-arms, discipline and turnout in preparation for the time when they would, in theory, be fit to take their place within the 1st and 2nd Battalions. The 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion ceased to exist in January 1943, when all such units were disbanded. A company of the 1st Battalion was involved in the Battle of Graveney Marsh, in September 1940 the last ground combat between a foreign invading force and British troops that happened on British mainland soil. The 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles formed part of the 1st London Infantry Brigade, itself part of the 1st London Division. In November 1940 the battalion transferred to the 2nd London Brigade, which was soon renumbered as the 168th (London) Infantry Brigade, due to the division's redesignation as the 56th (London) Infantry Division. From the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 until late July 1942, the battalion was in training, mainly in southeast England. The battalion left England in August 1942 to serve in the Middle East. In April 1943 the battalion, together with the rest of the 168th Brigade, was temporarily transferred to the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and fought in the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, in July/August. The battalion, as part of the 168th Brigade, returned to the 56th Division in Italy in October, and took part in major actions during the Italian Campaign at Fosso Bottacetto south of Catania, Monte Camino, Monte Damiano, the Garagliano crossing during the first Battle of Monte Cassino and Aprilia (Anzio), and at the Gothic Line, and, transferring back to the 167th Brigade, the battalion played a leading role in the final Allied offensive in Northern Italy during April 1945. In the month that they spent fighting in the Anzio beachhead, the 1st Battalion's casualties totalled 600 officers and other ranks killed, wounded and missing. Some 700 men of the London Irish Rifles were killed in action during the Second World War. A casualty is brought back across the River Reno during operations by 'C' Company of the 1st Battalion, London Irish Rifles to establish a bridgehead across the river, 6 April 1945. The 2nd Battalion formed part of the 38th (Irish) Brigade, initially as part of 6th Armoured Division and later within the 78th Battleaxe Division, a division with an excellent reputation, and was in front line service from November 1942 to May 1945 throughout Tunisia and Italy including taking part in major actions at Bou Arada, Heidous, Centuripe, Termoli, Sangro River, the Liri Valley, Trasimeno, Monte Spaduro and at the Argenta Gap. The battalion garrisoned parts of Austria in the immediate post- war period. During the final offensive in Italy the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bala Bredin.Major General 'Bala' Bredin, Obituary, The Times, 9 March 2005. Infantrymen of the 2nd Battalion, London Irish Rifles move forward through barbed wire defences on their way to attack a German strongpoint on the southern bank of the River Senio, Italy, 22 March 1945. Post war After the war, the battalion re-formed as a battalion of the Royal Ulster Rifles. In 1967, with the disbanding of the London Regiment, the three Irish Regular Infantry Regiments combined to form The Royal Irish Rangers, and the London Irish Rifles became D Company (London Irish Rifles), 4th Battalion The Royal Irish Rangers, remaining so until the re-formation of The London Regiment in 1993. Since 1993 and the incorporation of the London Irish Rifles as a company of the London Regiment, soldiers from the London Irish Rifles have served in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan and Cyprus. During Operation Telic, the company contributed to the formation of Cambrai Company (Operation Telic 3) and Messines Company (Operation Telic 4), both of which were commanded by officers of the London Irish Rifles.

He is bass player of the Swedish band Mando Diao. Biography Carl-Johan Peter Crispin Fogelklou, bass player of Swedish rock band Mando Diao was born on 15 August 1980 in Uppsala (Sweden) to Peter and Gunnel Fogelklou and is known to his fans as CJ. He has a sister called Lotta. When CJ was two, his family moved to Sigtuna near Stockholm. He was interested in playing the guitar from early years; his source of inspiration was the rock band Guns N' Roses. After he received his first instrument as a birthday present, he played in various bands and at school performances. A teacher in the local school, who gave him guitar lessons, encouraged him. After high school CJ studied music in Falun and there at a party he met Mando Diao drummer Samuel Giers who at once wanted him to become part of the band. CJ agreed and became a full-time musician instead of visiting one of the best music schools in Sweden where he had been accepted. CJ, an ardent vegetarian, who likes to cook and loves good wine, got on well with his new friends immediately. According to Gustaf Nor√©n, he was accepted because he looked like John Lennon and played the guitar like Paul McCartney. In 2000, Mando Diao had the composition under which it became known: Gustaf Nor√©n and Bj√∂rn Dixg√•rd playing the guitars and singing, Daniel Haglund on the keyboard, Carl-Johan Fogelklou on the bass, Samuel Giers on the drums. Daniel Haglund left the band in 2004 and was replaced by Mats Bj√∂rke. Touring bars and small locations all over Sweden was soon followed by performances in Central Europe; the USA and Japan. Each of Mando Diao¬¥s album releases became more successful; today they are one of Sweden¬¥s best known bands. Mando Diao¬¥s biggest success in their home country Sweden was achieved with the sixth studio album Infruset, were ten poems of the Swedish poet Gustaf Fr√∂ding were set to music in 2012. Carl-Johan Fogelklou first appearance as songwriter was made on Mando Diao¬¥s album Good Times (2017), the first album released after the break-up with Gustaf Nor√©n.

Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1977; pg. 116. He was also known for his ability to organize workers, both in the southern textile mills and the mines of Colorado.The Spanish Left in its Own Words At the 7th National Convention of the Communist Party USA in 1930, Oehler controversially demanded that the Trotskyists be permitted to rejoin the party, abruptly ending his career with the official party. He then joined James P. Cannon, Max Shachtman and Martin Abern in the Communist League of America, the nation's first Trotskyist group.Myers, The Prophet's Army, pg. 116. He was soon elected to the group's governing National Committee.Robert J. Alexander, International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement Oehler remained a prominent member of the League, serving on the committee of the International Labor Defense following the Loray Mill Strike.John A. Salmond, Gastonia 1929: The Story of the Loray Mill Strike He organised unemployed workers during the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934. In 1934, the Communist League merged with A. J. Muste's American Workers Party, becoming the Workers Party of the United States, and later entered the Socialist Party of America as part of Trotsky's \\"French Turn.\\" Oehler objected to this entrism as a tactic, believing that it would lead to the group becoming influenced by reformism, although once the group had entered, he argued that it should not leave, as this would be unprincipled. As a result, he exited the Workers Party in November 1935 to form the Revolutionary Workers League (RWL) with Tom Stamm and Sidney Lens.Max Shachtman, Footnote for Historians. During the Spanish Civil War, the RWL supported only the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Oehler visited Spain to report for the RWL, where he was involved in the Barcelona May Days struggles, and wrote Barcelona Barricades about his experiences. When he tried to leave the country, he was arrested on charges of spying and held without communication with the outside world for a month, before eventually being permitted to return home.Hugo Oehler, Barricades in Barcelona In 1937, Oehler broke with Leon Trotsky, concluding that Trotsky had split with Marxism in 1934. Stamm countered that Trotsky had degenerated in 1928, and the two split. In 1939, he severely criticised Trotsky's position for an independent Ukraine. In a polemic, he described his main differences with the Trotskyists as being \\"on revolutionary defeatism, on support for left-bourgeois governments, on support for third capitalist parties\\".Hugo Oehler, The Ukraine question: A Reply to Trotsky's Polemic With the declaration of the Trotskyist Fourth International, Oehler concentrated on finding international contacts, which he grouped into the Provisional International Contact Commission for the New Communist (Fourth) International. However, World War II proved the start of a dramatic decline for the RWL, which appears to have been disbanded in the early 1950s, and Oehler faded into obscurity. In the 1970s, Oehler lived in Denver, Colorado, and was interviewed there by Prometheus Research Library archivist Carl Lichtenstein.Carl Lichtenstein, 1942-2011, Workers Vanguard no 984, August 5, 2011 Footnotes  Works  *America's Role in Germany.

History The Indy's editing headquarters are located in Brown University's Faunce HouseThe Indy published its first issue on February 1, 1990, in which its beginning was described: ‚ÄúOur newspaper started in November when five students met at The Gate. All had been thinking about starting a new paper for some time.\\" The paper was decided to be ‚Äúa workshop in putting together a newspaper for interested contributors, that it tie together trends that affect the Brown community, that it preview upcoming events as well as reviewing past events, and that it provide Brown students an opportunity to explore the environment outside their campus.‚Äù The founding editors decided that in accordance with their last goal, they would eventually inquire about including Rhode Island School of Design students on their staff, to which the Rhode Island School of Design agreed. The newspaper became a project publication of the two schools on College Hill, Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design with a single staff composed of students from both schools. Today, The College Hill Independent is an alternative weekly newspaper written, designed, and illustrated by Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design students for the College Hill and greater Providence community. Ten issues are published per semester on a weekly basis. New issues come out Friday mornings and are distributed around Providence. The Indy is printed in Seekonk, MA by TCI Press.

Sections Although subject to change with each semester's influx of new editors, The Indy is currently organized into ten sections: ;News : The News section is anchored by the recurring \\"Week in Review\\" page, where a few news stories from the past week are highlighted, often to comedic effect. The remaining pages in the section often feature original reporting on national or international issues outside of the Providence and Rhode Island areas. ;Metro : The Metro section covers issues and news stories from the Providence and Rhode Island areas, be they about public art on College Hill or statewide economic issues, to cite a few recently published articles. ;Features : Features serves as a catch-all for any and all in-depth articles that don't quite fit in the other sections. Often, this can include more literary nonfiction-style pieces, interviews, or articles covering larger trends in local and national issues. ;Ephemera : Ephemera gives space for pieces integrating text and image, including poetry, photo, collage, and other formal experiments in visual storytelling. ;Arts : The Arts section features reviews of current art and previews of local art events, conversations with prominent artists, and examinations of the culture at large. The section's style is often marked by an illustrative contrast between criticism of high- and low-brow art, rarefied and popular culture. ;Literary : Poems, short stories, literary nonfiction, or even short plays all find room in the Indy Literary section. ;Science and Technology : The Science and Technology section publishes articles on scientific research and technological developments. and innovation and larger trends within the sciences, but also devotes space to personal/expository hybrid pieces on science and essays examining the interactions between science and society. ;Metabolics : This page has shifted between sports and food in recent years, with the two sections now dealing with 'the body'. ;Occult : This page, highly experimental in form, is dedicated to philosophical and often strange topics.http://www.theindy.org/?s=Occult ;List : This page features a rundown and critical analysis of events happening in the Providence metropolitan area, as well as the occasional conceptual poem.

It is on Oregon Route 34 and the Alsea River. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Alsea as a census- designated place (CDP). The census definition of the area may not precisely correspond to local understanding of the area with the same name. As of the 2010 Census, the population was 164. History Alsea was named for the Alsea River, whose name was a corruption of \\"Alsi\\" (also spelled \\"Ulseah\\" and \\"Alsiias\\") the name of a Native American tribe, now known as the Alsea, that lived at the mouth of the river. The Alsea area was settled by Europeans early as 1855, when the name \\"Alseya Settlement\\" appeared on the Surveyor General's map. Alsea post office was established in 1871. In the early 1850s settlers moved from the Willamette Valley into the Alsea area to take up donation land claims. While logging was once the primary industry in Alsea, it is now known as a place for fishing on the Alsea River, particularly for steelhead, and a favorite stopping point on a well-traveled cycling loop. Climate This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, Alsea has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.

History  The club has its roots in the village teams of SG Sigambria Geisweid, founded in 1908, and SpVgg Klafeld. In 1927 these two sides merged to form SpVgg Klafeld- Geisweid. This club was joined by Turngemeinde Friesen in 1946 to form \\"VfL Klafeld-Geisweid 08\\". The gymnastics department would separate the following year to become Turngemeinde Friesen Klafeld-Geisweid 1889. After World War II in 1946 the footballers began play in the Bezirksliga Siegerland (V) and won promotion to the Landesliga Westfalen (IV) in 1952 led by head coach (manager) Kurt Brosi (1949‚Äì56) who left the football club in 1956. They played at that level until 1957 when they were relegated to the Bezirksliga where the VfL footballers remained until 1963 when the club was promoted back to the Landesliga and thereafter advanced to the Verbandsliga Westfalen-2 (III) for the first time in 1964. A sixteenth-place finish saw the club quickly relegated to the Landesliga but they returned to third tier football in 1967. Just four years later, despite losing the overall division championship 0:1 to Arminia G√ºtersloh, the team earned promotion to the second division Regionalliga West for the 1971‚Äì72 season, which was the high point of the club's history. The team was well-supported in spite of its poor performance in the Regionalliga, drawing nearly 4,000 spectators a game. Part of the club's success through these years was based on the support of Hans Elbracht, head of the Edelstahlwerke S√ºdwestfalen GmbH steelworks in Geisweid, who made jobs available for the players, a critical contribution in an era of still largely amateur football in Germany. The side fell quickly after their single season turn in the Regionalliga, through Verbandsliga to the fourth division Landesliga within two years. On 13 October 1974 VfL lost a friendly to Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt by a score of 0:9. The club recovered and returned to third division play (Verbandsliga Westfalen-2 (III)) on the strength of a Landesliga title in 1978. VfL acquitted itself well finishing in the upper half of the table in five of the next seven seasons before being sent down again to the Landesliga in 1985. During this stretch the club made its first German Cup appearances in 1981 and 1982 losing 1:2 to Rot-Wei√ü Frankfurt and 0:4 to VfB Stuttgart II. The club currently plays in the tier eight Bezirksliga Westfalen where it has been achieving mostly mid-table finishes. The 2014‚Äì15 season has witnessed VfL Klafeld-Geisweid 08 being demoted to the Kreisliga A for the 2015‚Äì16 playing season after finishing in 15th place (second to last).VfL Klafeld-Geisweid Fussball.de, accessed: 27 March 2015  Stadium  The club plays is home matches in the Hofbachstadion which has a capacity of 10,000 spectators making it the second largest stadium facility in Siegen.

The game's most distinguishable feature is that players come equipped with a device that allows them to freeze and control certain robots. Story A united space force known as the Imperial Earth Army was launched past the Solar System. When the Imperial Earth Army returned, it came armed with large, living robots known as Bio-Cyborgs that it used to dominate and oppress the societies of Earth. Players assume the role of a rebel forces pilot who has launched a surprise attack against the oppressive Imperial Earth Army, armed with a recently developed weapon capable of controlling the Bio-Cyborgs. Gameplay The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub- standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks. There is also an addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected. Extends/1 Ups were awarded every 300,000 points. The Bio-Cyborgs Mars: A Bio-Cyborg armed with the three-way firing Mega Cannon and comes equipped with three Atomic Shields which are two-second long explosive rings that protect the cyborg from harm. Grain Beat/Odyssey: A Bio-Cyborg armed only with the Funnel guns which can be arranged to fire in three different forward-firing positions. Shadow Blade: The fastest of the Bio-Cyborgs which comes equipped with the Twin Cannon and the Dimension Field which makes the ship invincible for ten seconds. Titan: A muscular Bio-Cyborg armed with the Slice Laser and comes equipped with unlimited homing missiles. Neptune: A horned Bio-Cyborg armed with the Wide Lazer and is equipped with two Hyper-Bombs, a powerful blast that fires forward. Baron: A winged Bio-Cyborg armed with the Sonic Gun and is equipped with unlimited Diffusing Bombs, a bomb that fires onto ground forces. Hyper D: The slowest of the Bio-Cyborgs which comes equipped with the twin, diagonal firing Beam Gun and is equipped with unlimited Vertical Shields‚Äô, a flare weapon that not only hurts enemies but also destroys most enemy shots.

However, there were some significant differences between the two: *The animated opening from the original was completely removed from the console version. *2 Player co-op was removed from the home console port, although an option to change the game's difficulty and ship color was included. *Many enemies were cut from the home console version: in stage 3, the walker enemies were removed and placed only once in the final stage while some of the organic enemies in stage 4 were either removed or their AI was changed. *Many parts of the battleship Guanols were cut in the SNES port including a transport carrying parts of the level boss. *The design of the underground stage, Shurice, was redesigned in backgrounds, foregrounds and mini-bosses in the console port. The level was also originally the third level in the Arcade version, but switched to Stage 4 in the console port. *The ending (which only showed the game's Credits) was removed entirely from the home console version; instead, players restart the game with the same score and lives they beat the game with on a higher difficulty.

On February 10, 1995, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Building The club is a one-story, wood-frame vernacular meeting hall with a front gabled roof. It was erected in 1972. The rectangular building sits on a raised concrete block foundation. The roof is supported by wooden trusses and covered by asphalt shingles. Exterior The main entrance on the west side of the building faces North 14th Avenue. The building is fronted by a concrete porch with three steps leading to louvered double doors surrounded by windows. Panels of five lights each flank the doors, and above it a seven panel fanlight frames a sign with the club's name. Gabled returns supported by pilasters and a pair of Tuscan columns show a neoclassical architectural influence. Two four-light windows with green shutters are centered on either side of the door. Each of the windows has green two-panel shutters with cutouts of a full moon on top and a crescent moon on the bottom. The north and south side have four windows each, and the back of the building has three. The building is painted white and sheathed in clapboard except the four bottom courses covered with asbestos shingles. The porches and roof are green. Interior The front doors lead directly into the main assembly room. This room is deep and wide. There are white plaster walls and wooden door surrounds with a podium area on the east side distinguished by a framed panel of seven boards. The back of the building is equally divided into a kitchen and a dressing and storage room. Alterations The doors were originally ten-light French doors. There was lattice work on either side of the columns in front that has been removed. The double-hung multiple-light windows have been replaced with aluminum frame awning windows. A section of the east wall has been rebuilt without noticeably modifying the appearance. A back window was replaced by a door with a small porch. The kitchen was remodeled in 1944 with the installation of an electric refrigerator and gas stove. A suspended ceiling conceals the retained original wood tongue-and-groove ceiling. The main room has been carpeted, the bathrooms tiled, and a dishwasher installed in the kitchen. Walls and ceilings have been refurbished. Setting The land under the club and the surrounding Hollywood Lakes neighborhood was built up using the dredging from the two man-made lakes created as part of the development. The club's landscaping includes hedges, palms, shrubs, and open lawn. The building was originally planned to fit in with the architecture of local homes, but due to financial issues a simple wooden building was constructed with a neoclassical facade. The double lot was donated to the Hollywood Woman's Club by Joseph W. Young, the founder of Hollywood, specifically for a club house. The woman's club was organized in 1922 at the time when the city was just coming to be. The woman's club meshed closely with the vision of the town founders, and it played an important role in the development of the City of Hollywood.

Set 900 years after an apocalyptic war between humans and vampires, the series focuses on the ongoing cold war between the Vatican, the human government, and the \\"New Human Empire\\", the government of the vampiric Methuselah. Fighting on the Vatican's side is Abel Nightroad, a Crusnik - a vampire that feeds on vampires. The novels blend science fiction, fantasy, and political intrigue, with some in the Vatican and the Empire striving for peace, and the Rosen Kreuz Order doing anything in its power to stop it. Trinity Blood has been adapted into both manga and anime series, with continuity differences between the three versions. His friend Yasui aided in completing the manga, with illustrations by Kiyo Kuj≈ç. The anime series, spanning 24 episodes, was produced by Gonzo and originally aired on Wowow network. Plot When Earth's population drastically increased, humanity, led by the United Nations, attempted to colonize Mars. During the colonization, they discovered two alien technologies: the Bacillus virus and the Crusnik nanomachines. The colonists injected the Bacillus in their bodies which transformed them into a vampiric race known as \\"Methuselah\\". They installed the Crusnik in the bodies of four test tube babies: Seth, Cain, Abel and Lilith whose enhanced bodies were the only ones able to survive the procedure. Continuing wars on Earth eventually led to Armageddon, the apocalyptic event that happened 900 years before the start of the story, and the colonists returned to Earth to help with rebuilding. However, when the colonists returned to Earth, a war broke out between the Methuselah and the humans who had remained on Earth. Abel, Cain, and Seth sided with the Methuselah‚Äîwhile Lilith supported the Vatican, which guarded humanity. During the war, Cain went insane and killed Lilith. In grief, Abel took her body to the Vatican where she was buried. Abel remained at her side, weeping for her, for 900 years. At the start of the story, the Methuselah, still a major political and military force, continue to wage war on the \\"Terrans\\", as they call the human inhabitants of Earth. The Roman Catholic Church is a major military power determined to protect humans from the Methuselah, with its seat of power based in the Vatican. The Methuselah have their capital in Byzantium, which is surrounded by a field of particles to filter out UV radiation, protecting the Methuselah population. Both groups use \\"lost technologies\\", such as airships, missiles, and computers, to engage in a cold war with one another. A third great power, Albion also plays a role in the war with its superior arsenal of lost technology and weapons and higher level of manufacturing ability versus the Vatican. The independent monarchy of Albion is a primarily human country, however the secret of their expertise in lost technology is found in the Ghetto, an underground city of enslaved Methuselah. It is these Methuselah who operate and manufacture the lost technology, but with the death of the Albion Queen, some of the enslaved vampires begin a rebellion for the freedom of all of the Ghetto residents. Differences among adaptations While the novels, manga, and anime series all cover the same basic story and feature many of the same characters, they do have some minor and major differences. Each has its own unique variation on the major story arcs, and in general the novels give the most detail concerning the political elements and background information on the stories. There are a few minor name changes and many details found in the novels are not given in the anime or manga. right The artwork also differs from all three versions, as the character designs were each created by different artists. There are similarities, however, as Shibamoto is responsible for the novel illustrations, while Kiyo Kuj≈ç based his work in the manga on Shibamoto's original designs. In the anime series, Dietrich von Lohengrin's cold, evil nature is reflected in his appearance, while in the manga he has a softer, bish≈çnen design that is incongruous with his actual nature. Similarly, Endre is described as looking like a boy of around 10‚Äì12 years old, while in the anime he is given an adult appearance. In additions to variants in appearances, there are differences in personalities relationships between the versions, and there are some characters that are unique to each adaptation. Sister Noelle, whose death devastates Abel in the anime series and in the novels, does not exist in the manga series. Alternatively, the anime does not mention Father Tres' two \\"brothers\\". Depending on the adaptation, some events occur at varying points in the story, while other events are unique to a single adaptation. The anime series' introductory-style episodes are based on the novel segments with the same names, but they are told in a different story. For example, in the novels, \\"From the Empire\\", the chapter in which Abel meets is the third chapter, following Flight Night and Witch Hunt, However, in the anime, From the Empire is the eleventh episode, coming after the Star of Sorrow arc and the Silent Noise incident. Conversely, the manga starts right with the Star of Sorrow arc and Abel meeting Esther and Dietrich. The Neumann brothers and their related story elements are found only in the novels. In the novels, it was Abel who interrupted the Cardinal's gathering, rather than Caterina or Leon, and the only people available to investigate the Silent Noise incident in Rome are Abel, Tres, and Leon. Characters Humans The humans once attempted to colonize Mars after a massive population explosion. While on Mars, they discovered the Bacillus and Crusnik nanomachines. When the Bacillus virus was embedded in humans, they were infected with a virus that changed them into vampires who had to feed on blood to survive. While this was happening on Mars, on Earth, continuing wars resulted in Armageddon, the apocalyptic war that nearly destroyed humanity. The vampires‚Äîwho now call themselves Methuselahs‚Äîand the humans ended up in a war against each other when the Methuselah returned to Earth. Nine hundred years later the surviving humans are still trying to recover from the war's devastating effects while trying to find ways to co-exist with the Methuselah despite the distrust and hatred still evident on both sides. The Vatican serves as the primary leader for the people in the ongoing struggle for peace with the Methuselah, and in dealing with rogue factions from both sides that would like the war to continue. The Methuselah refer to humans as \\"Terrans\\", or the \\"Short-Lived Race\\". Methuselah The Methuselah, or \\"Long-Lived Race\\", are vampire-like creatures that feed on human blood and have supernatural strength. Their name is likely derived from the biblical figure Methuselah, who was reported to have lived 969 years. Methuselah have a prolonged lifespan, superior strength, and enhanced speed. They also have healing and regeneration abilities. In addition to their athleticism and stamina, Methuselah also possess varying individual powers. Most frequently, this power manifests itself in the form of a blade that comes out of the arms, claws, or even as sharp, prehensile hair. Some Methuselah have displayed an ability to control some elemental powers such as fire and ice. When being born, a Methuselah behaves as any normal human. He or she is able to wake during daytime and lacks the supernatural life and shortcomings of the race. Crusniks Cain, Crusnik 01, in his Crusnik form Crusniks are vampires who feed on the blood of other vampires. They possess immense power and destructive potential and are nearly invincible. Whereas the Methuselahs are either born or infected, the Crusniks are unique beings created as a result of an experiment during the Mars Colonization Project. The three Crusniks, Seth, Abel, and Lilith, were test tube babies created for the Mars Colonization Project by the UNASF with genetically enhanced bodies. They were infused with the Crusnik nanomachines that were found on Mars as their enhanced bodies were the only ones capable of surviving the procedure. The exact circumstances behind the infusions of Seth, Abel, and Lilith are unknown, while Cain's infusion was done by Seth to save his life after a fatal accident. Crusniks possess unique attributes that separate them from Methuselahs. For instance, both Abel and Cain sport angelic wings and can fly quite easily. Crusniks can transmute their blood into weapons and often possess psychokinetic powers. Abel can generate powerful bio-electric fields while Cain can use psychokinetic waves to pulverize objects and enemies and to generate barriers. Seth can reduce people and objects to dust using sound waves. In order to activate his Crusnik powers, Abel usually issues a verbal or mental command to the nanomachines in his body. The exact wording and method of activation varies among the novels, the manga, and anime, and between the original Japanese and the English translations. For example, in the anime he says \\"Nanomachines: Crusnik 02 - Power Output __% Activate\\" while in the manga he silently activates Crusnik mode and receives a confirmation from the nanomachines of \\"Crusnik 02 Loading. Limitation at __%... Acknowledged\\". In the anime, neither Cain nor Seth demonstrated a need to do this in order to activate their powers, and there are several times when Abel activates his powers without saying his usual command, so it appears to just be a literary device; the only exception to this is in the third novel where Sister Paula Souwauski, who is in combat with him, prevents the change by not letting him finish the statement, as it would flip the playing field as Abel in his human form is ranked as having a B‚àí fighting ability while his 40% Crusnik is described as an S+. Media Novels Written by Sunao Yoshida and illustrated by Thores Shibamoto, Trinity Blood consists of two six-volume sub- series. The first series is subtitled Rage Against the Moons (RAM), while the second series, which continues where the first leaves off, is subtitled Reborn on the Mars (ROM).

Its North American debut was also considered successful. The series is one of four FUNimation properties credited with helping the company achieve a 47.8% sales gain in 2006. Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger finds the series \\"shiny, attractive, and‚Äîon the whole‚Äîentertaining\\". But he adds that \\"given the premise (and skill of the writers) it really should have shot for pulpy thrills instead of stately political intrigue.\\" Theron Martin says \\"for the series as a whole to be worth watching, though, the storytelling and character development need to improve\\". Melissa Harper adds it is a \\"slick, well animated show\\" but \\"disjointed story makes it difficult to know or care what is going on\\". Hyper's Daniel Wilks comments that the anime is \\"for most part rather formulaic but the series does really pick up when it comes to the action scenes which are fast, frenetic, highly creative and beautifully animated\\".

It is named after Alderman Baldwin and Kitty Bantock who once lived there. It is run by Wolverhampton City Council's Arts and Museums service. History The house was built in the 1730s as New Merridale Farm. It was extended and improved during occupancy by Thomas Herrick about the beginning of the 19th century and renamed Merridale House. The house had several tenants but in about 1864 was bought by Thomas Bantock, a canal and railway agent. His son Albert Baldwin Bantock, who was twice Mayor of Wolverhampton and also High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1920, further improved the property following his father's death in 1896. On his own death, without children, in 1938 he bequeathed the house and park to Wolverhampton Corporation. The house was renamed in his honour in 1940. It is a Grade II listed building. Bantock House Bantock House contains displays exploring the lives of the Bantock family and other locally important people. On the ground floor, there are displays about the Bantock family and the way they lived. Upstairs, the focus shifts to the men and women who shaped Wolverhampton and the industries they created with displays featuring locally-made enamels, steel jewellery and japanned ware. The museum is unusual in that it avoids for the most part the use of traditional 'glass case' displays, and instead presents a 'more informal and imaginative setting'; visitors are, for example, encouraged to sit on any furniture they can find. Bantock House Gardens The rose garden The gardens that surround the house were designed by Albert Baldwin Bantock and in 1998 were restored to his original designs by Wolverhampton City Council, allowing visitors today to see the different spaces Baldwin created. At the back of the house there is a sunken garden called the Dutch Garden. There is also a rose garden, with an array of roses with names such as Blythe Spirit, Chapeau de Napoleon and Glamis Castle, colourful flower borders in the house garden and a woodland garden which now forms part of a nature trail around the park. Bantock Park Bantock Park has of land and includes a play area for children, a small, 18 hole golf course, a putting green, and football fields. Highland cattle were bred by the Bantock family and are believed to have roamed the grounds of the park up until around the 1930s. To recreate the presence of the cows, local craftsman Neil Watt was commissioned to create a cow sculpture, which can now be seen at the front of the house.

Biography  She was born in C√©spedes, a small village in the Camag√ºey Province of Cuba, into a poor peasant family. She sang a cappella in clubs in Havana and recorded only one album before her death from a heart attack. Her weight (over 300 lbs) gave a very distinctive, androgynous sound to her voice. She was, almost entirely, a singer of boleros and canciones.Giro, Radam√©s 2007. Diccionario enciclop√©dico de la m√∫sica en Cuba. La Habana. vol 2, p. 124 When she moved Havana at the age of 12, she became a cook for the family of Arturo Bengochea, who was the president of the Cuban League of Professional Base-Ball, but she soon found herself singing nights at the Bar Celeste, on Humboldt and Infanta Streets, a place where artists used to meet. She was spotted by the director of the Hotel Capri's casino and given a contract. She opened at the Cabaret Capri with orchestration by Rafael Somavilla in the review Piminta y Sal (pepper & salt) with other singers, dancers, and a quartet led by pianist Carlos Faxas. Freddy appeared in several key TV programs, like Jueves de Partagas (1959), which she remembered dearly. On that show she appeared with Benny Mor√© and Celia Cruz. Freddy traveled to Venezuela and then on to Mexico with a company led by dancer and choreographer Roderyco Neyra (Rodney). From there, she flew, along with others, to Miami and then to Puerto Rico. She got several contracts and was even presented on San Juan TV.  In popular culture  She appears as Estrella Rodrigues in Guillermo Cabrera Infante's book about Havana's nightlife during the years of the Revolution, Tres tristes tigres (published in English as Three Trapped Tigers) (1966). Portions of this, featuring Freddy predominantly, were later republished as Ella cantaba boleros. She also appears in the novel The Island of Eternal Love by Da√≠na Chaviano (2006). Discography Her only album is known variously as La voz del sentimento or Ella cantaba boleros. It was recorded in 1960 for Puchito Records under the reference: Puchito MLP 552.

It opened in 1928 as a speakeasy (with associated rum-running), gambling den and restaurant. It is the oldest extant structure in the City of Lighthouse Point and the oldest commercial enterprise in the area. Includes four maps. With . It has operated as a restaurant since opening and is the oldest restaurant in Broward County, Florida. On August 10, 1990, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is located at 2980 Northeast 31st Avenue. There is no parking at the site; patrons take a boat shuttle to the facility. Setting Cap's Place is a collection of five wood frame vernacular buildings, four of which are considered historic. It is located on a peninsula between Lake Placid and the Intracoastal Waterway, in a residential neighborhood in the City of Lighthouse Point, Broward County, Florida. The first building was erected in 1928 on a beached dredging barge. It has been described as having \\"no architecture, save Cap's own creative style, born of need and materials available in Florida in 1928.\\" The site was expanded to its current L-shaped configuration in 1929. At the time of this construction the peninsula was very narrow and portions of the buildings extended over the water. In the 1960s the bay side of the peninsula was filled, raising the elevation of the land and extending the shoreline past some of the buildings that had been partially over water. The site is flanked by water to the east and west. A buffer of slash pine and Australian pine to the north and south retains much of the feel of the original setting. It was originally only accessible by water. Layout The structures making up the establishment are a restaurant (original building with expansion), a bar, a fish house, a dock and walkways and a boat house (not considered historic due to alterations). All of the buildings were constructed with native materials, including Cuban mahogany, bamboo, pecky cypress, and Dade County pine. Some of the building material was purchased from the recently established Pompano Lumber Company. The restaurant was built in two stages; the initial portion was constructed on a beached dredging barge which raised the structure above ground level. The restaurant The barge was stripped to provide a base for a one-story wood framed building with a gabled roof. The interior and exterior wall of this portion are constructed of thick horizontal pine planks. The windows and doors are symmetrically placed and original wood casings and surrounds remain. The main entrance is on the east side and is flanked by multiple pane windows with wood sashing. The south side is covered with plywood for protection from water damage but windows are visible from the interior. This portion forms the east‚Äìwest portion of the extant L-shape. The restaurant addition is a long rectangular building sitting on concrete block piers and has wood floors and a horizontal board exterior. Built of Dade County pine, this building has a low-pitched asphalt shingle roof. The main entrance is on the north side, with another entrance on the east side. While aluminium windows have been installed on east and west sides, the original window woodwork remains intact. This addition had red carpet and became known as the \\"Poinsettia Room\\" or the \\"Poinciana Room\\". It was joined to the original building by a foyer in 1954. The Poinsettia Room was the principal site of gambling. The original building was divided into dining rooms, one of which was painted yellow and separated by 3/4 height walls, and a kitchen in the northwest portion of the building. Between the \\"yellow room\\" and other dining rooms there was a hallway lined with six nooks where slot machines were located. These nooks remain intact in size and shape but shelving has been added. A money counting room at the south end of the Poinsettia Room had a private exit to the east. The bar The bar located to the north of the restaurant is connected to it by decking with picnic tables. It is a rectangular building with windows that match those of the restaurant, and has a south facing door. Patrons in the deck area are served through a wood-shuttered opening east of the door. There is an additional door and a small projecting storage room on the west side. The interior decoration of the bar is distinct; a large bar of everglades bamboo topped with old ship decking and accentuated by a mirror is the dominant feature of the room. It is decorated with objects found washed up on the shore while the building was built. The floor and roof are Dade County pine while the ceiling beams and walls are pecky cypress. During the time there was gambling at Cap's Place, there was a Wheel of Fortune and curtained alcoves. The alcoves have since been boarded up but the outlines remain visible on the walls. The bar and restaurant are decorated throughout with flotsam and jetsam and memorabilia. Other buildings Soon after the initial construction a fish house was built on pilings over the water. This small rectangular building was used for fish cleaning and dish washing; dirty water and fish scraps were dumped into the water. Over time the shoreline has silted in, and this structure is now used for storage. The pilings that had elevated it above the water remain visible. The buildings of Cap's Place are connected by a series of decks, piers and docks. While the shoreline has changed, these structures remain intact. A boat house where the owners lived on the site has been extensively repaired and reconstructed, and is not considered historic because of this. A six-room bunkhouse built to provide housing for restaurant workers no longer exists. History In 1928 Eugene Theodore \\"Cap\\" Knight and Albert Hasis beached a dredging barge on a small peninsula in the Hillsboro Inlet and built a restaurant on its stripped base. They named the restaurant Club Unique, but it was always known as \\"Cap's Place\\". Knight had operated a store and restaurant nearby since 1920. The location of the previous business was subject to severe weather, and the site no longer exists due to coastal erosion. He had also been engaged in rum-running for some time. The barge, purchased for , was originally beached about a half a mile from its current location. It was moved due to expansion of the Intracoastal Waterway; the hawser ropes used are wrapped around a large piling in the bar. From the beginning it was clear that Club Unique would be a speakeasy with gambling and dining. By the end of 1929, the club had expanded with the construction of a number of other buildings. Knight also operated a separate gambling barge nearby in the 1940s. Cap's Place is historically important locally, to Florida and the United States as an early local commercial enterprise run by one of the original settlers in the area, and as a part of the rum-running and gambling history of southern Florida and the US. Author Carmen McGarry wrote about Cap's Place, \\"A landmark comparable to no other in south Florida, it has withstood prohibition, mobsters, depression, wars, the ravages of nature, and many joyful and peaceful times for nearly a century.\\" One unique aspect of Cap's Place was that it was only accessible by water (until 1953). Patrons would drive to Hillsboro beach and flash their headlights, signalling an employee who would row across the water and take them to the restaurant. Cap's Place is now accessible by road, but only handicap parking is available on- site, and most patrons continue to be ferried by boat. The restaurant had unusual items on the menu and a reputation for very fresh seafood. With its rustic setting, outstanding menu and the added draw of drinking, and later gambling, Club Unique has been popular and successful since its opening. During the gambling era private memberships to the \\"supper club\\" were sold for 25 cents. It was a significant location for rum-running during Prohibition. The Hillsboro Club across the Intracoastal did not serve alcohol, and customers would come to Cap's Place to drink. Originally the dinner menu was just shrimp, snapper, pompano, Spanish mackerel, fried oysters, and chicken. Knight \\"didn't didn't even believe in dessert. 'If we haven't fed 'em enough, we're doing something wrong'\\", according to Talle Hasis. Eugene and Lola Knight Eugene \\"Cap\\" Knight was born in or near the Canaveral lighthouse, Cape Canaveral, Florida in 1871. His father, his grandfather and later his brother worked as lighthouse keepers in Florida. Knight was one of the earliest settlers in the Hillsboro Beach area. From a seafaring family, he left home at 13 to join the merchant marine. He started as mess boy on a lighthouse tender and left the service 35 years later in 1919 as a Master of Morgan Line Steamers, sailing between New Orleans and New York. In 1916 Knight married his second wife, Lola Saunders, a schoolteacher for the children of lighthouse employees and fishermen of Hillsboro Inlet. Knight's previous marriage, to Bertha Lydia Armour, produced three children and ended in divorce before 1914. Lola Saunders, the daughter of a circuit riding Methodist preacher, was born in a log cabin near Cross Creek in an area now part of the Ocala National Forest. When Prohibition started in 1920, the couple got involved in rum-running. The Hillsboro Inlet Lighthouse guided Eugene Knight as he returned from Bimini with burlap sacks full of illegal liquor called \\"hams\\". It has been suggested that his brother Tom the lighthouse keeper may have signaled him when \\"the coast was clear\\". The sacks of liquor would be tied to buoys and sunk, to be hauled up later. Knight's boat was faster than those of the Coast Guard, and he was never caught. Another brother, Burnham Gray Knight, has been called the founder of charter fishing. Historian Wesley Stout called Eugene Knight an \\"outstanding character of Broward County.\\" Author Carmen McGarry wrote, \\"Cap was truly a legend of his time.\\" Lola Knight later recalled, \\"many a night hauling those sacks of liquor up the beach\\" and making runs to deliver to their customers. When asked if she was scared, she replied, \\"Scared? We were never scared. I'm not afraid of the devil himself, and neither was Cap.\\" She slept with a loaded pistol under her pillow and often worked as hostess for the restaurant wearing a cotton dress, diamond necklace and no shoes. A story she often told was of Henry Flagler eating a favorite dish at Cap's Place, fresh pompano, then later writing the word \\"pompano\\" on one of his railroad maps; the location became Pompano Beach, Florida. The barge Cap's Place was built on was previously owned by Flagler and he had used it in constructing his Overseas Railroad. She also related that Meyer Lansky would stop by weekly to pick up 10 to 12 percent of the gambling profits (Hasis also mentioned Lansky's involvement). Lola Knight said, \\"We paid off everybody.\\" Illegal gambling casinos were to become a substantial part of the fabric of south Florida, with 52 of them operating openly in Broward County by 1950. The couple had other business interests including a fleet of fishing boats, a wholesale fish market and a fishing camp in the everglades. The building on stilts above the water now known as the boat house was their home for thirty years. Eugene Knight died in 1964 and Lola Knight died in 1989. They are buried beside each other in the Pompano Beach Cemetery. Albert Hasis and Sylvester Love Around 1926 Knight met and befriended the 16 year old Albert Hasis from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hassis had also left home at the age of 13. The friendship and partnership they developed lasted the remainder of their lives. Together they built and ran Club Unique. Hasis built the distinctive bar featuring a large carved bowsprit salvaged from the sunken wreck of a 200 year old Spanish galleon. The bar is built from bamboo and polished wood from ship's decks; an oil portrait of Knight hangs over the bar. Hasis met and married Patricia \\"Pat\\" McBride in 1945. Knight had never bought the land the restaurant was built on, Patricia Hasis borrowed $5,000 and bought the 1,000 feet of land on the Intracoastal Waterway. Albert and Patricia Hasis died in 1982 and are buried in the Deerfield Beach Cemetery. In 1940 Sylvester Love came to work at the Club Unique, starting as a dishwasher, he advanced to chef. The son of a sharecropper, he left home in Georgia at 12. Love was chef at the restaurant for 48 years until 1985. He always wore a white chef's coat, starched apron and high white chef's hat even when the kitchen was 100 degrees, according to Hasis' daughter, Talle Hasis. In contrast \\"Cap\\" Knight wore bib overalls and Lola Knight was known for going barefoot. He described Knight as a tough \\"but good man (who) took me in. He recalled coming to work one morning finding a woman sitting on the dock who had lost $48,000 on the wheel saying, \\"Oh there were some big spenders...Those were the days. He said of his time at the restaurant, \\"You know it's hard work, but I've enjoyed every minute of it. No regrets at all.\\" Love was a guest on the television show Good Morning America about 1987 discussing his experiences working at the restaurant. After retiring as chef he continued to work at the restaurant, preparing it for opening and overseeing the daily fresh fish deliveries until his death in 1990. Modern times Cap's Place enjoyed its peak popularity in the 1930s and 1940s when locals and tourists frequented the establishment to dine, drink, and gamble. At the time there was limousine service from the upscale Palm Beach County hotels. It continues to be popular with celebrities; artists, sports figures, movie stars, and the socially prominent patronize the establishment. Oral histories suggest Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt may have dined there one night while attending strategy meetings for World War II at the nearby estate of Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius. While the story of Churchill and Roosevelt's visit has been discredited, Churchill did visit, dining in the yellow room. A partial list of notable visitors includes Meyer Lansky, Al Capone, Humphrey Bogart, Myrna Loy, Jack Dempsey, Casey Stengel, Bill Clinton, George Harrison, Mariah Carey, Jim Belushi, George Wendt and Gordon Ramsey. According to author Philip Weidling, \\"all the society of Palm Beach ate there at one time or another.\\" Patricia Hasis established a rule, still in effect, that staff is prohibited from bothering celebrities, violation can result in immediate dismissal. Patricia Hasis said, \\"\`We have a more interesting clientele because people really have to look for us.\\" The repeal of prohibition in 1933 saw the end of rum-running. Legal pressures put an end to gambling at Cap's Place in the 1950s. When Eugene Knight died, Albert and Patricia Hasis and Lola Knight continued to run the restaurant. Lola Knight remained active in running the restaurant until 1959. Eugene Knight had not paid taxes and when he died the IRS placed liens on the property. Patricia Hasis paid the debts over time. As a part of the agreement to pay the tax debt and take control of the restaurant Hasis provided housing and care for Lola Knight for the rest of her life. New ownership Since the 1970s the restaurant has been run by the Hasis' three children, Talle, Ted and Tom. As a child, Talle Hasis would sit outside the restaurant with her tea service, selling little cups of water to the patrons and collecting five dollar tips. She is named after the state capital. On August 10, 1990 Cap's Place was added to the US National Register of Historic Places. There was some local objection to this listing. Neighbors complained the place was unsightly and characterized the attempt to have it listed as a tax dodge. The nomination was prepared by Research Atlantica for the Hasis siblings. In 1991 the City of Lighthouse point designated Cap's Place as a historic structure, the first such designation by the city. An important impact of this designation is based on a law passed earlier that year Cap's Place would be able to rebuild after a catastrophe. Prior to the passage of the law and subsequent designation the restaurant would have been prohibited from rebuilding as it is located in a residential zone. These actions were met with opposition in the community and were controversial because Tom Hasis was a city commissioner. The former mayor of Lighthouse Point, Leo Bentz, raised concerns about commercialization of the area, that the establishment could be expanded and that with no controls over Cap's Place the bar could stay open until 2AM. Hasis abstained in both votes and both measures passed 4-0. He continues to be active in local politics. In the early 1990s a road was built on the peninsula known as Cap's Island and luxury homes were built to the north and south of the restaurant. Lot prices were close to $1.5 million. A menu from Cap's Place was included in a time capsule by the Broward League of Cities in 2000. Cap's Place was featured in a 2012 public television documentary, Prohibition and the South Florida Connection. In 2012 it was also used a filming location for the television show The Glades. the Hasis siblings were joint owners. A 2017 newspaper article identifies Tom Hasis as \\"one of the owners of Cap's Place\\". His wife, Maureen Hasis, is also involved in running the restaurant. When asked about the future in 2013, Talle Hasis noted none of the siblings have children and said, \\"I guess when they take us out horizontally, which is the only way we'll be leaving, that will be it.\\" She has also said, when asked about retirng, \\"That word's not in my vocabulary, if anything, I'll be sitting out there in Cap's rocking chair, barking orders.\\" the establishment continues to operate as a restaurant, shuttling guests from a dock near the parking area to the restaurant's dock, and is being considered for a stop on the Fort Lauderdale water taxi route. Present day The approach through narrow winding residential streets in Lighthouse Point, followed by a boat ride to the restaurant coupled with the rustic setting and decor create a unique dining experience. The ceilings are low and the floors crooked but Talle Hasis tells those who complain, \\"Just duck your head down. My father built a strong place, low on the land.\\" The menu includes all types of fresh fish, crabs, lobster and grouper chowder. It has been updated from the past and now includes appetizers and even key lime pie for dessert. In the past green turtle steaks and turtle egg pancakes with guava jelly were also featured. In 1963 Knight was arrested for possession of illegal turtle eggs, of an endangered species. Knight had been known to keep thousands of turtle eggs frozen. Very fresh seafood is a hallmark of the restaurant. In 2005 they were still buying their fish fresh daily from Captain Murphy a local fisherman as they had for decades. All meals are cooked to order. A house specialty, hearts of palm salad is made with sabal palm from the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee. The hearts of palm have been supplied by the same Seminole family since the restaurant opened. Meals come with hot rolls and homemade Sea Grape jelly. Cap's Place has been positively reviewed from the 1980s to the present. Prices are moderately expensive. The restaurant relies mostly on word of mouth and doesn't advertise much. It has been called one of south Florida's most colorful landmarks.

The game simulates naval combat between Arab and Israeli missile boats during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. The game is an introductory level product with an emphasis on playability over historical accuracy. Publication Yaquinto Games issued Fast Attack Boats as one in their series of \\"Album Games\\", which used the same-sized jacket as a double vinyl record album, with the mapboard printed inside the jacket and game components stored in the two sleeves. Other games in the Album Games series included Swashbuckler. The game components are: * 179 die-cut counters representing Egyptian, Israeli, and Syrian boats and missiles; * a 12\\" by 24\\" hexagon- patterned abstract scale mapboard (printed on the inside surface of the album cover) * two plastic bags for counters * a game card for each player * a rulebook. The game requires but does not include two six-sided dice. Yaquinto Publications did not issue errata for Fast Attack Boats.  Game Play  Fast Attack Boats may be played to represent a single engagement under the \\"Battle Game\\" rules, or a series of up to ten engagements under the \\"Strategic Game\\" rules. The mechanics of both are identical with the exception of fleet selection and deployment. In the Battle Game, players agree upon a common total number of points for each fleet and select naval units of varying point values until each fleet has reached its limit. All units are immediately deployed, Arab units forming a line on one side of the mapboard and Israeli units on the other. The rectangular shape of the mapboard, long missile ranges, and the requirement for boats to use their full movement value often lead the two opposing sides into simple head-on charges. The range, large quantity and high degree of destructiveness of the cruise missiles also typically leaves the much shorter range guns and torpedoes to play a minimal role near the end of an engagement, and the confines of the mapboard limit boats trying to maneuver. Most battle games, therefore, are completed in 15‚Äì30 minutes or less and involve a significant degree of luck over skill. The winning player is the one with the last surviving boat on the mapboard. The Strategic Game requires the use of all naval units, and divides the forces into three sides (Egyptian, Syrian and Israeli). The Arab player divides up the Egyptian and Syrian fleets for five rounds of combat each, while the Israeli player must fight all ten engagements (5 rounds against each Arab power). There is provision for players to shift forces from one round to the next, but the Egyptian and Syrian fleets operate independently and may not combine, a restriction the Israeli player does not face. The movement and combat sequence of play is identical to the Battle Game. The Strategic Game is slightly more complex than the Battle Game and may require three or more hours to resolve, but is still predominantly a game of chance. The winner is the first player to reach six victories, or in the event of an even number of victories, the side that lost the fewest total points in the values of the eliminated boats. The Arab fleet is composed of Komar and Osa boats armed with Styx missiles and P4 torpedo boats. The Israeli fleet is made up of assorted Saar boats equipped with a mix of Gabriel Mk1 and Mk2 missiles and torpedoes. Alternative rules include allowing two persons to play the Arab fleets in the Strategic Game, thus creating a three-player game; permitting the Israeli player to move less than the full movement factor to reflect Israel's better trained crews; and making ramming more difficult.  Simulation Value  Fast Attack Boats admittedly does not attempt to replicate the lopsided naval engagements that took place during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, but instead is designed as a game that \\"captures the flavor of the actual events.\\" Consequently, it does not simulate any particular naval exchange or geographic area, instead opting for generic open seas engagements with player-selected fleets. The rulebook's \\"Brief Historical Summary\\" incorrectly characterizes the 1973 Arab-Israel War's naval encounters as \\"one of the most decisive and stunning victories by a weaker power in the history of sea warfare,\\" and that if \\"the Arab powers had been able to gain control of the sea, they could have disrupted the flow of supplies to Israel, which could have meant disaster for the hard-pressed Israeli Army.\\" While the Israeli Navy's performance was impressive, it was not one of naval history's stunning victories and had no effect on the ground campaigns in the Golan or the Sinai where the conflict was decided. Moreover, while the United States did begin resupplying Israel at the end of the first week of the war, these military supplies were sent via air, and even then arrived too late and in too few quantities to influence the outcome of the war. The legacy of the conflict instead lies in the debut of electronic countermeasures in naval combat and the widespread use of cruise missiles. The designer also takes liberties with the actual equipment and tactics both sides employed during the conflict. For example, Fast Attack Boats does not factor in Israel's highly effective electronic countermeasures that rendered the Arab Styx missiles largely useless, or the Syrian fleet's use of unwitting merchant ships to hide behind from incoming Israeli Gabriel missiles. The rules do devote significant attention to ramming an opponents boat, although this tactic was not used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War and is generally not a feature of 20th century naval combat, but probably reflects the narrow confines of the mapboard and the near inevitability of the two fleets crossing one another's path during game play.

Camino criticized the single map, which he found to be quite confining for combat based on boats that historically used hit and run tactics. He also questioned the premise of the basic game, in which historical accuracy was sacrificed for ease of play.

In his six years working for Jim Henson and the Muppets, he helped launch the original The Muppet Show in 1975, and worked on Sesame Street, Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas Special, and The Muppet Movie. He later produced and managed dozens of productions, including several thousand individual shows from daytime soap operas to primetime shows such as Mad About You, and late night shows such as The Dick Cavett Show. He won an Emmy Award for his work at ABC Sports on the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games. He currently develops screenplays. History Holman began his career in 1962 at KTBC-TV, Austin, TX, while attending the University of Texas, Austin, TX, where he was studying Radio & TV Broadcasting. First as a Floor-crew member at KTBC-TV and worked his way up to being an award-winning TV director. In 1964 while still at KTBC-TV he produced, directed, choreographed & danced in a \\"music video\\" before music videos had even been know or become popular. That short B&W; 16mm film got Holman this first job in New York City that same year as an Associate Producer of national TV & Radio commercials with Norman, Craig & Kummel Advertising, one of the largest advertising agencies in the world. Within 3 months Holman was made a producer and produced over 100 TV & Radio commercials, a few of which became \\"classic\\" including Ajax Laundry Detergent's \\"White Knight\\" and Hertz Rent-A-Car's \\"The Flying Man\\". After 3 years, ABC Sports hired Holman to be a Unit Manager for Wide World of Sports covering sporting events in the U.S. and England including NBA basketball, NCAA football, Track & Field, Swimming & Diving, and PGA Golf tournaments, including the British Open in Blackpool, England. After 3 years Holman was promoted by ABC to be the first Production Administrator assigned to a multiple of TV series and specials including The Dick Cavett Show, the Tony Awards, the Grammy Awards and the EMMY Awards. While in this ABC position in 1973 Holman met Jim Henson. ABC was producing a Muppet TV Special called A Muppet Valentine Special with actress Mia Farrow as the only human guest star. (Miss Piggy had not been \\"born\\" yet, nor was Kermit the Frog the host) When ABC ordered a second TV special, The Muppet Show: Sex and Violence for a possible Muppet TV series in prime-time, Henson hired Holman away from ABC to be his associate producer for that second pilot.The Alcalde, January, pp. 40, Vol. 63, No. 3, .listing show credits includes \\"Associate Producer: David Holman Original Airdate: March 19, 1975 on ABC; DVD Release: Buena Vista Home Video, 2005.

In 1971 Paramount produced the first season of Entertainment Tonight on the same stage as The Merv Griffin Show. ABC Sports was preparing for the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games and hired Holman to be a Production Administrator in 1982, and then promoted him a year later as the Head of Logistics for the International Broadcast Center (IBC) on the Sunset-Gower Studio lot. Holman won a TV Emmy Award for his work on that world TV event. After Holman wrapped this 2-year free-lance position he was named Director of Live & Tape production for Columbia Pictures Television. Within a few years Holman was named VP of Production for all of Columbia's TV productions at the Sunset Gower Studios and later after Sony purchased Columbia, most of the TV productions were produced at Sony Pictures (formerly MGM) and the Culver Studios, both in Culver City, CA.

She now performs under the name Kate Jackson & The Wrong Moves. Biography Jackson attended Culford School in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk and took leading parts in the school's performing arts shows. In the late 1990s, she moved to Sheffield to study English and History. Soon after graduating, Jackson began writing and performing with fellow graduates of the city's universities forming The Long Blondes. Whilst the band were unsigned, she studied fine art and also worked at Freshman's Boutique, a vintage clothing shop in Sheffield. This interest in vintage clothing became a distinctive feature of the image of The Long Blondes. Jackson herself describes her style as \\"Bonnie Parker meets a Carry On girl\\". In 2006, Jackson was ranked number seven in NME's Cool List. Despite the number one spot being given to Beth Ditto, of The Gossip, and the 2006 list being equally divided between male and female performers, Jackson responded to this accolade with: \\"They probably thought they didn't have enough girls. It was so overrun with boring boys, they needed someone to bring a touch of glamour.\\"The Guardian, accessed 6 February 2007 The NME described her as having the \\"arrogant strut of Chrissie Hynde and the acidic tongue of a [Charles] Dickens heroine.\\"NME, accessed 6 February 2007 Jackson is a passionate spokeswoman for Sheffield.

Friedman (born July 20, 1954) is a molecular geneticist at New York City's Rockefeller University and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. His discovery of the hormone leptin and its role in regulating body weight has had a major role in the area of human obesity. Friedman is a physician scientist studying the genetic mechanisms that regulate body weight. His research on various aspects of obesity received national attention in late 1994, when it was announced that he and his colleagues had isolated the mouse ob gene and its human homologue. They subsequently found that injections of the encoded protein, leptin, decreases body weight of mice by reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. Current research is aimed at understanding the genetic basis of obesity in human and the mechanisms by which leptin transmits its weight-reducing signal. Education Friedman was born in Orlando, Florida on July 20, 1954, and grew up in North Woodmere, New York, graduating from Hewlett High School in the Class of 1971. As a young man he aspired to becoming a physician. He entered a six-year medical program out of high school and received his M.D. at the age of 22. But after a year-long fellowship working in the laboratory of Mary Jane Kreek, he fell in love with the science life. \\"As a doctor, you're trained to absorb the facts you're given and accept them,\\" says Friedman. \\"Science is almost the opposite. It's a frontier of discovery that's always moving. And I decided I wanted to do research.\\" Friedman started his affiliation with the Rockefeller University in 1980,Jeffrey M. Friedman - Nobel Conference 46 Nobel Conference - 2010 where he was awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1986. Friedman received a BS from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1973 and M.D. degree from Albany Medical College in 1977 and completed a medical residency at Albany Medical College in 1980.The Discovery of Leptin, the Hormone That Regulates Body Weight From 1980 to 1981, he also served as a postgraduate fellow at Cornell University Medical College. Career and research Friedman was appointed Assistant Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at The Rockefeller University in 1986, promoted to Associate Investigator in 1991, and Investigator in 1996 and received the Marilyn M. Simpson professorship in 1998. When Friedman started his own laboratory at The Rockefeller University, he turned his attention to the question of weight regulation. Working with a special strain of mice, he set out to identify the hormone that normal animals use to control their appetite - a molecule that was missing in the plump rodents. After eight years‚Äîon May 8, 1994, at 5:30 a.m.‚Äîhe found what he was looking for: evidence that he'd located the gene that produces the hormone he later dubbed \\"leptin\\", after the Greek word for \\"thin\\" (ŒªŒµœÄœÑœåœÇ leptos).The Discovery of Leptin, the Hormone That Regulates Body Weight \\"It was astonishingly beautiful\\", he says of the x-ray film that nailed the gene, a piece of data that now hangs on his office wall. Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that energy balance in animals and humans is tightly controlled. With the identification of leptin and its receptors by Friedman's laboratory, two of the molecular components of a system that maintains constant weight were identified. Leptin is a hormone secreted by the adipose (fat) tissue in proportion to its mass that in turn modulates food intake relative to energy expenditure. Increased fat mass increases leptin levels, which in turn reduces body weight; decreased fat mass leads to a decrease in leptin] levels and an increase in body weight. By this mechanism, weight is maintained within a relatively narrow range. Defects in the leptin gene are associated with severe obesity in animals and in humans. Leptin acts on sets of neurons in brain centers that control energy balance. Leptin also plays a general role in regulating many of the physiologic responses that are observed with changes in nutritional state, with clear effects on female reproduction, immune function and the function of many other hormones, including insulin. Leptin feeds into the circuit of neurons in the brain that controls eating and energy expenditure. When an animal loses weight, leptin concentrations fall. This dip in leptin levels instructs the body to search for food. In studies of obese mice, Friedman has found that leptin actually restructures the brain, rewiring the neural circuit that controls feeding. The hormone reinforces the nerve cells that encourage the body to slenderize and prunes the neurons that compel eating. Friedman has published over one hundred and fifty publications and over ten book chapters. He is also involved in the research related to the 1st inbred rat model of obesity and aging, also known as WNIN/Ob obese rats developed in National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India.

Overview Sometimes classified as one of Stevens' \\"poems of epistemology\\", it can be read as an expression of the naturalistic skepticism that he absorbed from his friend and mentor George Santayana. It is doubtful that anything can be known about a substantial self (Santayana was an epiphenomenalist) or indeed about substances in the world apart from the perspectives that human imagination brings to \\"the nothing that is\\" when it perceives \\"junipers shagged with ice\\", etc. There is something wintry about this insight, which Stevens captures in The Necessary Angel by writing, \\"The world about us would be desolate except for the world within us.\\"Stevens, p. 169. The poem is an expression of Stevens' perspectivism, leading from a relatively objective description of a winter scene to a relatively subjective emotional response (thinking of misery in the sound of the wind), to the final idea that the listener and the world itself are \\"nothing\\" apart from these perspectives. Stevens has the world look at winter from a different point of view. When thinking of winter, one might think of a harsh storm. One might also think snow and ice to be a nuisance. Stevens wants people to see the opposite view. He wants the world to look at winter in a sense of optimism and beauty. He creates a difference between imagination and reality. See \\"Gubbinal\\" and \\"Nuances of a Theme by Williams\\" for comparisons. B.J. Leggett construes Stevens's perspectivism as commitment to the principle that \\"instead of facts we have perspectives, none privileged over the others as truer or more nearly in accord with things as they are, although not for that reason all equal.\\"Leggett, p. 6. This principle that \\"underlies Nietzschean thought\\" is central to Leggett's reading.Stevens. H., p. 432: \\"The incessant job is to get into focus, not out of focus. Nietzsche is as perfect a means of getting out of focus as a little bit too much to drink.\\" (Letter from Wallace Stevens to Henry Church, December 8, 1942) It may be observed that Stevens's remark in the passage quoted above from The Necessary Angel falls short of conforming to that principle, implying a condition of \`the world about us' that is distinct from the perspectives we bring to it.

Overview The PAW-20 is a hand-held, semi-automatic grenade launcher that fires a 20 mm point detonating round. It holds six rounds in a detachable rotary magazine, with an effective range of 300‚Äì400 meters. It was designed mainly as an anti-personnel grenade launcher for use against opposition closely grouped together or behind light cover. However, it is also compatible with less-than-lethal ammunition. The PAW-20 is in direct competition with the more complicated and expensive joint German-U.S. XM25 CDTE and Korean S&T; Daewoo K11. The PAW-20 has attracted some criticism due to the location of the ejection port; these allegations have largely been addressed as the spent casings are ejected no closer to the operator's face than in a conventional assault rifle being fired from the left hand. Due to the unique location of the pistol grip on the side of the weapon, it can be fired from the left shoulder for a right-handed operator by simply placing the butt on the left shoulder, with no hand swapping necessary. This allows the user the advantage of being able to fire from around or under cover, with little time required to change the grip on the weapon. The right-handed location of the pistol grip also allows the weapon to recoil unimpeded into the shoulder of the operator, allowing for a much more manageable recoil than most weapons of this class. Moreover, the weapon uses the recoil to operate, instead of more traditional gas operated systems and is an interesting example of an inertial operated weapon. 20x42 mm cartridge The 20x42 mm cartridge was specifically developed for the PAW-20 by Denel PMP, decreasing the overall weight and size of the weapon, and enabling it to hold more rounds in the magazine, compared to weapons of similar purpose and design, such as the XM25 CDTE, which typically fire 25mm or larger grenades. It has a muzzle velocity of 310 m/s (1,000 ft/s), and a much flatter trajectory than the more common 40mm grenade launcher round. A number of less-than-lethal rounds are also available for the PAW-20.

In 1957, to make way for the Schuylkill Expressway, the western pier of the bridge was removed, and the main spans of the bridge were replaced. In 2011, a weight restriction was placed on it due to its age. In August, 2019, the bridge was closed to vehicles and pedestrians for one year to repair the steel superstructure and replace the deck.

Binghamton, NY: Vail-Ballou Press. and gender stereotypes led directly to more equal employment opportunities for women in the United States. Influences on the field of psychology Bem was an American psychologist known for her works in androgyny and gender studies. Bem and her husband Daryl Bem advocated egalitarian marriage. The husband-wife team became highly demanded as speakers on the negative impacts of sex role stereotypes on individuals and society. At the time, there was a lack of empirical evidence to support their assertions because this was uncharted territory, and so Sandra Bem became very interested and determined to gather data that would support the detrimental and limiting effects of traditional sex roles. In her early career, she was heavily involved in women's liberation movement, and she did work on sex-biased job advertising. Her involvement led to being a contributor to landmark cases concerning recruitment of women in the work force against companies such as AT&T; and the Pittsburgh Press. Early on in Bem's career she created the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI), which is an inventory that acknowledges that individuals may exhibit both male and female characteristics.Psychologist's Feminist Voices. The BSRI is a scale developed to determine what kind of sex role an individual fulfills. It is a self-report inventory that asks participants how well 60 different attributes describe themselves by using a seven-point scale. These attributes reflect the definition of masculinity (20 questions) and femininity (20 questions), and the remaining 20 questions were merely filler questions (Bem, 1993). In this inventory the feminine and masculine items were chosen on what was culturally appropriate for males and females at that time in the early 1970s. The BSRI was later used to measure psychological flexibility and behavioral indicators. Bem also developed the gender schema theory. According to the gender schema theory, \\"the child learns to evaluate his or her adequacy as a person in terms of the gender schema, to match his or her preferences, attitudes, behaviors, and personal attributes against the prototypes stored within it.\\"Bem, S.L. (1981). Gender schema theory; A cognitive account of sex typing, Psychological Review, 88(4), 354-364 This theory states that an individual uses gender as a way to organize various things in a person's life into categories. Her research questioned the social beliefs and assumptions that sex roles are opposite, bipolar, and mutually exclusive. The data she collected were supportive of a merging of male and female traits to enable a person to be a fully functioning, adaptive human over an emphasis on gender stereotypes. She asserted that masculine and feminine dimensions could be divided into two spheres, rather than one: A person with high masculine and low feminine identification would be categorized as \\"masculine\\". A person with high feminine identification and low masculine identification, would be categorized as \\"feminine\\". A person who had high identification with both characteristics would be categorized as \\"androgynous\\". A person who has low identification with both dimensions would be considered \\"undifferentiated\\". One of Bem's main arguments was that traditional gender roles are restrictive for both men and women, and can have negative consequences for individuals as well as society as a whole. As previously mentioned, a person could be categorized as \\"androgynous\\" when taking the BSRI. Androgyny is defined as \\"the integration of both masculinity and femininity in a single individual\\". Androgyny allows one to freely engage in both masculine and feminine behaviors. According to Bem, people's behavior can demonstrate what she defined as situational appropriateness. Situational appropriateness is demonstrated when behavior is reflective of one's environment. For example, a woman demonstrating knowledge of sports at a basketball game is appropriate. Androgyny may also blend modalities. An example of androgyny blending modalities would be a woman being both assertive and compassionate when firing someone from a job.Bem,S.L.(1974). The measure of psychological androgyny. Journal of Counseling and Clinical Psychology, 42(2), 155-162 Awards and honors Sandra Bem received many awards for her research. Her first was the American Psychological Association Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career contribution to Psychology in 1976. In 1977 she was awarded the Distinguished Publication Award of the Association of Women in Psychology and in 1980 she received the Young Scholar Award of the American Association of University Women (Makosky, 1990). In 1995, she was selected as an ‚ÄúEminent Woman in Psychology‚Äù by the Divisions of General Psychology and History of Psychology of the American Psychological Association. Critics of Bem's work generally argued against the political nature of her theories and her objectivity in the material which she studied. Education and career Bem attended Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, now known as Carnegie‚ÄìMellon University,, Women‚Äôs Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society. (1961‚Äì1965) and majored in psychology. She recalls the head of the counseling center, Bob Morgan, encouraging her to study to become a psychiatrist. This was the first time such a high-status career had ever been suggested to her. Subsequently, she entered the University of Michigan in 1965 and obtained her Ph.D. in developmental psychology in 1968.Parker Makosky, V.,(1990). In, A. O'Connell & W. Felipe Russo (Eds.), Women in psychology: A bio-bibliographic sourcebook,(pp. 30‚Äì39). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press Inc. Her dissertation focused primarily on cognitive processing and problem solving with young children. Her main influence while at the University of Michigan was experimental psychologist David Birch. Her early work focused on the behavior of young children and their ability to solve problems, and utilize self-control and instruction. After obtaining her Ph.D., Bem got a full-time tenure-track position as a professor at Carnegie-Mellon for three years and then moved on to work at Stanford University, where she worked until 1978. She left Stanford University because her application for tenure was denied. She and husband Daryl Bem both took tenured teaching positions at Cornell University in 1978, where she became a psychology professor and the director of the women's studies program. While at Cornell, Bem focused research on gender schema theory, sexuality, and clinical psychology until she retired in 2010. Personal life Bem was born June 22, 1944 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Peter and Lillian Lipsitz. She grew up in a working class family with one younger sister, Beverly. Both of Bem's parents worked throughout her life, so she grew up with the assumption that she would always be working. Her mother encouraged her to be the absolute best that she could be, and that \\"being just a housewife was not very desirable.\\" Bem's first career goal was to be a secretary like her mother, so that she could have her own phone and desk ‚Äì symbols of autonomy and status that her father never had. Bem was raised by her Jewish working class parents in a government-subsidized neighborhood for the first eight years of her life. During Bem's childhood, her mother would have violent outburst and fights with her father causing her family much distress. Her mother was the dominant figure in her parents' relationship, and Bem recalls having a very tumultuous childhood, during which Mrs. Lipsitz would become extremely emotional while upset and throw objects during arguments. Bem also stated that she was quite unsuccessful in her attempts at flirting and dating with men, and so she internalized a belief that no man would ever want to marry her, which helped to solidify her career ambitions. But she eventually married Daryl Bem, also a psychology professor. The two met when she took his social psychology class at Carnegie‚ÄìMellon University. She was 20 years old at the time. She initially rejected his marriage proposal, having concerns about her own career. The two later agreed on an egalitarian marriage, in which they agreed to share in making decisions, doing household chores, supporting each other's careers, and performing parenting duties ‚Äì all as equally as possible. With this in place, she consented to the marriage. After months of dating, the two were married on June 6, 1965. Much of Bem's family, including her mother, would not attend the wedding because it was a non-Jewish affair and they did not agree with this decision. The Bems had two children together. They also had a grandson, Felix Viksne Bem (son of daughter Emily). While they eventually chose to live separately, they remained married until Sandra's death on May 20, 2014. Illness and death Bem was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, four years after diagnosis and after pursuing experimental treatments, she followed through with her plan to die by suicide at her home in Ithaca on May 20, 2014. Her husband, Daryl, was present with her when she died. Works  Bem, Sandra L. and C. Watson. (1976). \\"Scoring packet: Bem Sex Role Inventory\\". Unpublished Manuscript  Bem, S. L.

Early life and education Haghighi was born in Tehran, the son of the translator and gallery owner Lili Golestan and the cinematographer Nemat Haghighi. His maternal grandfather is the writer and filmmaker Ebrahim Golestan. Haghighi was educated in Iran and, from the age of 15, Appleby College in Canada. He took a BA in philosophy at McGill University in Montr√©al, where he studied under Charles Taylor and Brian Massumi, and directed plays including Pinter‚Äôs Betrayal and Shakespeare‚Äôs Macbeth. He then followed postgraduate studies at Guelph and Trent universities. He contributed a chapter to A Shock to Thought: Expression after Deleuze and Guattari, edited by Brian Massumi, and also translated Michel Foucault's This is Not a Pipe into Farsi. Career Films Haghighi‚Äôs uncle, the photojournalist Kaveh Golestan, introduced him to photography and film making. Haghighi moved back to Iran in 2001 and worked for several years in advertising, shooting television commercials, educational films and documentaries. His first feature film, Abadan (2002), was shot on a Sony PD-150 camera with no official shooting permit. It was the first Iranian independent feature film to be shot with a digital camera. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2002. The comedy Men at Work (2006), based on a story idea by Abbas Kiarostami, premiered at the Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival and went on to win several international prizes, including the Asian Film Award for its screenplay. In 2006, Haghighi and Asghar Farhadi wrote Fireworks Wednesday, a domestic social-realist drama that dealt with issues of class and alienation in contemporary Tehran. The film, directed by Farhadi, premiered at the competition section of the Locarno film festival and was awarded the best screenplay prize at the Three Continents Film Festival in Nantes. It won the Golden Hugo Award at the Chicago Film Festival. Canaan (2007), Haghighi's second writing collaboration with Farhadi, was based on \\"Post and Beam\\", a short story by the Nobel prize-winning Canadian author Alice Munro. It marked a departure for Haghighi away from absurdist dark comedy toward a more straightforward narrative of domestic conflict. The film won the audience prize in the International section of Tehran's Fajr Film Festival. Modest Reception (2012), his fourth feature film, was written in collaboration with the theatre director Amir Reza Koohestani. Marking a return to Haghighi's preoccupation with absurdism, the film tells the story of two urbanites (played by Haghighi himself and Taraneh Alidoosti) who drive around an unidentified, mountainous and war-torn region, handing out bags of cash to poor villagers in return for increasingly sadistic demands. The film premiered at the Forum section of the Berlin Film Festival and won the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema (NETPAC) prize. A Dragon Arrives! was shot on location in the Valley of Stars on Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf. The film screened in the competition section of the Berlin Film Festival in 2016. Scott Foundas called the film \\"the revelation of the Berlinale -- a fever dream Iranian horror-western; Kiarostami meets Jodorowsky.\\" In 2016, Haghighi made 50 Kilos of Sour Cherries, a popular romantic comedy that became, in the year of its release, the third-highest grossing film in the history of Iranian cinema. The film was quickly embroiled in controversy due to its frank treatment of female sexuality and unconventional approach to romance in the Islamic Republic. It was eventually banned from screening, with the culture minister Ali Janatti claiming that its release had been a mistake. In response, Haghighi published two consecutive open letters to Janatti, outlining the elaborate censorship process the film had endured and accusing him of deception and bad faith. \\"Hand over your job to someone who can handle it,\\" he advised the minister. Jannati resigned from his post a month later. In 2018, Haghighi made Pig, a black comedy about the misadventures of a black- listed film director who is falsely accused of the serial murder of his colleagues. It premiered in competition at the Berlin Film Festival and subsequently won l'Amphore d'Or for Best Film from Festival International du Film Grolandais, Toulouse. Richard Brody of The New Yorker named it as one of the best films of the year. In December 2019 it was announced that Haghighi would produce Subtraction based on a script co-written with Amir Reza Koohestani. The Mehrjui documentaries Between 2007 and 2016 Haghighi produced and directed two documentaries about the Iranian filmmaker Dariush Mehrjui. The shorter film Hamoun's Fans (2008) dealt with the phenomenal success of Mehrjui's classic cult film Hamoun (1989). Haghighi published an open call to everyone who considered themselves a fan of the film to write him a one-page explanation of their reasons for loving it. From the hundreds of responses he chose five people to tell their stories. The second film, Mehrjui: The 40 Year Report (2015), is an exploration of Mehrjui's entire oeuvre through detailed interviews with Mehrjui himself, as well as his collaborators and critics. The film won the Best Documentary Film Director Award from the Fajr Film Festival, Tehran. Yalasarat Controversy and Trial In September 2016, the fundamentalist weekly journal Yalasarat al-Hussein published an article claiming to have uncovered a love triangle involving Haghighi, the actress Taraneh Alidoosti and the director Asghar Farhadi. The article, which referred to the protagonists with thinly veiled pseudonyms, prompted instant outrage. Director Ebrahim Hatamikia and the executive committee of the film-makers trade union demanded legal action against the journal. In the end, Farhadi and Alidoosti decided against taking legal action, but Haghighi filed a formal complaint and, in March 2019 the publication's editor, Abdolhamid Mohtasham, was found guilty of defamation and sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence and a five-year revocation of the publication's licence.

It was constructed in 1908 and is believed to be the only active inland waters lighthouse in Maine. The tower is tall, and is equipped with a 100-watt light bulb further intensified by a lens from a ship's anchor light. At the time of its construction, it was the only inland lake lighthouse east of the Mississippi River. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History The lighthouse was designed by Frank Morse, a Boston marine architect. The small island on which it was constructed, Ladies Delight, is formed by the central part of a large reef; the lighthouse was built to keep a passenger launch at the south end of the lake from running aground in the area. The Cobbossee Yacht Club erected the tower with the help of two oxen. Due to the size of their barge, they could only transport one at a time. They took the first one to the island, and then returned to shore for the second. In the interval the first ox grew lonely, and began swimming back to the mainland as the workers returned with its partner. Finally, both oxen were successfully transported, and the lighthouse was built over the course of the summer. Members of the Cobbossee Yacht Club have always maintained the lighthouse. Originally its light was provided by kerosene lanterns; a volunteer keeper went out each evening to trim the wicks, clean the globes, and light the beacon. A reflector in the light was rotated by a system of weights from a longcase clock. A wind-powered generator powered the light for a while in the 1930s; currently, power is provided by cable from Manchester. The lantern has been blown off the tower twice; sometime in the 1990s the original iron one was replaced by one made of wood. At one time there was an osprey nest on the top of the tower. Located in the North Bay of Cobbosseecontee Lake, the lighthouse was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. In 2001 it had a severe list corrected and in 2005 a new top constructed of marine grade aluminum was installed. The structure was formally dedicated on July 16, 2005 in a ceremony conducted by retiring CYC Commodore, Hugh Stephens. On August 9, 2008 a 100th anniversary celebration was held at the lighthouse followed by an anniversary party at the nearby home of a former commodore.

The Tektronix 4050 was a series of three computer graphics microcomputers produced by Tektronix in the late 1970s through the early 1980s. The display technology was similar to the Tektronix 4010 terminal, using a storage tube display to avoid the need for video RAM. They were all-in-one designs with the display, keyboard, CPU and DC300 tape drive in a single desktop case. They also included a GPIB parallel bus interface for controlling lab and test equipment as well as connecting to external peripherals. A simple operating system and BASIC interpreter were included in ROM. A key concept of the systems was the use of a storage tube for the display. This allowed the screen to retain images drawn to it, eliminating the need for a framebuffer, computer memory devoted to the display. Most systems of the era had limited resolution due to the expense of the buffer needed to hold higher resolution images, but this was eliminated in the 4050s and allowed the resolution to be as high as the hardware could handle, which was ostensibly 1024 by 1024 but limited by the physical layout of the screen to 1024 by 780. It also allowed the machine to dedicate all of its memory to the programs running on it, as opposed to partitioning off a section for the buffer. The first model, the 4051, was based on 8-bit Motorola 6800 running at a 1 MHz. It normally shipped with 8 KB of RAM and was expandable using 8 KB modules to 32 KB. The remaining 32 KB of address space was reserved for ROM, which could be expanded using two external ROM cartridge of 8 KB each. It included six character sets in ROM and an extended dialect of BASIC that included various vector drawing commands. The 4051 was released in 1975 for the base price of $5,995. Adding the optional RS-232 interface allowed it to emulate a Tektronix 4012 terminal. The second model was the 4052, which in spite of the similar name was a very different system. This had a CPU based on four AMD 2901 4-bit bit-slice processors used together to make a single 16-bit processor. It could also be used in a 6800-compatible mode, allowing it to run software from the 4051, although it did so much faster than the original 4051. Released in 1978, it came with a full 32 KB of RAM for $9,795, and could be expanded to 64 KB for another $1,995. The 4054 was a version of the 4052 built around the 19\\" screen from the 4014 terminal rather than the 11\\" screen from the 4012, increasing resolution to 4,096 by 3,072. External storage units were available for the 405x series computers. The 4924 was an external version of the internal DC300 tape drive. The 4907 used single or dual Shugart 851R 8-inch floppy drives with 64 KB floppies and the larger, 2-drawer filing cabinet sized, 4909 storage unit used a CDC 96 megabyte hard drive with the first 16 megabytes in the form of a removable disc-pack. Two sizes of the 4956 graphics tablet offered a slow process for inputing from paper drawings. The 4952 joystick was used for graphics input. Because the direct view storage tubes do not flicker as do conventional CRTs, and because the BASIC programming interface allowed simple, rapid rendering of vector graphic displays, the 405x series were used in many theatrical contexts. In particular, 405x computers can frequently be seen in early Battlestar Galactica sets. The graphic display software was based upon software originally developed in the 1960s by Corning Glass Works for their Type 904 graphics terminal. The display for this system had characteristics to the similar to those of Tektronix storage tube display. It used small pixel regions composed of photosensitive glass, which could be darkened (forming a black line image) by writing, and would display this persistently until the entire display was erased. When Corning left the market this software base was sold to Tektronix. The original demo included an artillery game which was later adapted by high school students at Lindbergh High School in Renton, Washington to the HP 9830, and also adapted by Hewlett Packard for the HP 2647 intelligent graphics terminal demo tape and eventually similar games in Microsoft BASIC for the IBM PC. Other games for the Tektronix included Weather Wars, with users directing lightning bolts and tornados against opponents in an environment affected by wind.

The band was the original home of Luke Haines. The band's Small Time album was well received on its 2012 release, more than twenty years after its 1991-recording. The belated release followed the inclusion of 1990's Disinterest in Mojo magazine's 2011 list of the greatest British indie records of all time. History Singer-songwriter David Westlake started the band in Hayes, Middlesex with school-friend Ed Moran. The Servants played their first gig at The Water Rats Theatre in London's King's Cross on 1 July 1985. The line-up for most of the early gigs was: David Westlake, John Mohan, Phil King and Eamon Lynam (a.k.a. Neasden Riots). Declining offers from Statik, Stiff, and √âl, they signed with Head Records, set up by Jeff Barrett, later head of Heavenly Records. Westlake's urbane English songwriting was well received by the press, and the band was invited to record a John Peel session soon after the release of first single \\"She's Always Hiding\\" (March '86). Keen to distance themselves from the \\"shambling\\" scene, the band earned a reputation for haughtiness. They grudgingly accepted an invitation by the then-popular NME to appear on their C86 compilation, insisting on the track being the B-side of their first single ‚Äì the wrong-footing \\"Transparent\\". The NME compilation turned out to sell well and the Servants became known for a lesser track. The band's next release, the four-song EP The Sun, a Small Star (August '86), showed Westlake's songwriting still becoming more deft, the title-track later being described as \\"a 24 carat 'Brown Eyed Girl' classic\\". Luke Haines was in the Servants from early 1987 to late 1991. Drummer Hugh Whitaker left The Housemartins and joined the band as they returned to the studio to demo new material for Creation Records. In early 1988, the Servants moved to Glass Records, who promised a reasonable budget to record an album. Plans were made to go into the studio with John Brand, producer of Hayes punk band the Ruts. At the eleventh hour, the band were told that Glass distributors Red Rhino had \\"gone bust\\". The budget was slashed, and they went into the studio to record the single \\"It's My Turn\\". They played some gigs to support the single but Glass delayed releasing the record for a year. The Servants released its debut album, Disinterest, in 1990 on Paperhouse Records. \\"It is art rock\\", Haines later said, \\"Ten years too late and fifteen years too early.\\" Westlake and Haines recorded the Servants' second album, Small Time, in 1991. Not until twenty-one years later ‚Äì following the inclusion of Disinterest in Mojo magazine's 2011 list of the greatest British indie records of all time, ‚Äì was it released, in 2012 on Cherry Red Records (then in 2013 on Captured Tracks). Small Time is Westlake's own favourite Servants record. The songs are, says Haines, \\"looser, more mysterious, strange and beautiful, . . . sounding . . . like nothing else really.\\" The long unavailability of 1990's Disinterest is explained in the Small Time notes: it is \\"stuck in an irretrievable record company quagmire, where it looks set to remain.\\" Small Time was issued with a second disc, Hey Hey We're the Manqu√©s, containing demos and rehearsal versions of first-album material. The Servants' last gig was at the Rock Garden, 21 August 1991 ‚Äì \\"With no room to manoeuvre and no opportunities left\\", the band finally called it a day. Belle & Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch told U.S. music magazine The Big Takeover (issue 53, 2004) that he was a huge Westlake fan and that he had tried to locate Westlake in the early '90s in the hope of forming a band with him, before starting Belle & Sebastian. Cherry Red Records released a 2006 retrospective of the Servants, called Reserved. The compilation features all of the releases prior to the Disinterest album plus Peel session tracks and demos. US label Captured Tracks released a 2011 vinyl compilation of the Servants, called Youth Club Disco. Westlake and Haines played together for the first time in twenty-three years at the Lexington, London N1 on 4 May 2014. Westlake and band played at an NME C86 show on 14 June 2014 in London to coincide with Cherry Red's expanded reissue of C86.Time Out, 11 December 2013 David Westlake solo David Westlake recorded a solo album for Creation Records in 1987. Backed by Luke Haines (making his recording debut) and the Triffids' rhythm section, Westlake cut against the grain of the paisley psychedeliasts then on the Creation roster, Haines later describing it as a minor classic.

Life Little is known about Eike of Repgow, but he is mentioned in several documents dating from the period between 1209 and 1233.According to the Reppicau Web site Eike of Repgow is mentioned in seven documents: *1156: On December 28 \\"Eico and Arnolt de Ripechowe\\" as witnesses at the Landgericht held by Margrave Albert the Bear in W√∂rbzig *1209: \\"Eico de Ripichowe\\" named as a witness in a document in which Johann and Walter of Giebichenstein transfer ownership of a castle to the Bishop of Naumburg. *1215: Count Hoyer of Falkenstein and \\"Hecco de Repechowe\\" listed as witnesses to legal transactions between the Kollegatstift Coswig and Count Henry of Aschersleben, who later became Prince of Anhalt. *1218: On May 1 \\"Heiko von Repchowe\\" witnessed the transfer of property from the Margrave Dietrich von Mei√üen to Altzella Abbey. *1219: The name \\"Eico von Repechowe\\" is mentioned, together with that of Count Hoyer of Falkenstein, in a document in which Prince Henry of Anhalt ended a legal dispute with the Stift Goslar. *1224: \\"Eico von Ribecowe\\" is names as a witness at the Landding of the County of Eilenburg in Delitzsch, which was convened under the presidency of Landgraf Louis of Th√ºringen. *1233: \\"Eico von Repechowe\\" is mentioned on a deed of gift by Margraves Johann and Otto of Brandenburg to the benefit of Berge Monastery. He was a scion of the Eastphalian gentry and it is thought that his family were vassals of the Magdeburg archbishops. His ancestors had moved to the Gau of Serimunt, south of Magdeburg, in the 12th century, where they acquired land in the village of Reppichau (in present-day Saxony-Anhalt). Other members of the family are mentioned earlier in 1156 and 1159. From his mention in court proceedings in 1209 it is inferred that he was born around 1180. Lack of mentions after 1233 suggests that he died shortly after that. From the prologue to the Sachsenspiegel it is clear that Eike could read Latin as well as German. It is not actually known if he could write, since it was quite common, at the time, to employ scribes. He was versed both in Canon and Roman law; so it is thought that he was educated at a cathedral school, possibly in Halberstadt, or more likely at Magdeburg under Archbishop Wichmann von Seeburg. It is clear that he was a respected personage, but his precise place in the feudal hierarchy is not known with certainty, since he is sometimes listed among the free nobles and sometimes among the bondsmen (Dienstmannen). Eike of Repgow may have been a bondsman of Count Henry I of Anhalt or of Count Hoyer of Falkenstein, who then served as Vogt of Quedlinburg Abbey. Nevertheless, he was probably a free noble, one of the so-called sch√∂ffenbar freie, which entitled him to sit in the Thing (baron's court). One theory is that he was of noble birth, but like many others, became a ministerialis or bondsman, while retaining his noble status. Works Sachsenspiegel Eike of Repgow translated the Sachsenspiegel at the behest of Count Hoyer of Falkenstein between 1220 and 1233. It was intended by its compiler to document existing, customary law, not to create new law. The work is of great significance not only as the first German legal code but also as one of the first major works of Middle Low German prose. As the author writes in the verse prologue of the Sachsenspiegel, he first wrote it in Latin and later, with some reluctance, at the wishes of Count Hoyer of Falkenstein, translated it into German. The Latin version of the first part, on Landrecht (common law), has been lost, but the second part, on Lehensrecht (feudal law) was, as is now believed, preserved. This is the Vetus auctor de beneficiis, which is written in verse. There was a debate as to whether this was the Latin original of the part of the Sachsenspiegel on feudal law or a later translation of it into Latin, and for some time the latter view prevailed. However, the current consensus is that the Vetus auctor de beneficiis is indeed the Latin original of the feudal law section of the Sachsenspiegel. Where the original was compiled is unclear. It was thought to have been written in Quedlinburg or at Falkenstein Castle in the Harz Mountains, but Peter Landau, an expert in medieval canon law recently suggested that it may have been written at the Cistercian abbey of Altzelle (now Altzella).The suggestion that the Sachsenspiegel was written at Altzelle was made in a paper given by Professor Landau at the Deutscher Rechtshistorikertag 2004 and later published in an article (Landau, Peter: Die Entstehungsgeschichte des Sachsenspiegels: Eike von Repgow, Altzelle und die anglo-normannische Kanonistik; Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Deutsches Archiv f√ºr Erforschung des Mittelalters 2005, Vol 61, No. 1, pp 73-101), cited at the German Wikipedia article on Kloster Altzella and http://www.rechtsbuchforschung.de . S√§chsische Weltchronik Another work, the S√§chsische Weltchronik has been dated about 1230 and also been attributed to Eike, but this is now thought unlikely. Commemoration Statue of Eike of Repgow at the former Reichsgericht building in Leipzig There are monuments to Eike of Repgow in Magdeburg, Dessau, Reppichau and Halberstadt and at Falkenstein Castle in the Harz Mountains. There is a square named after him in Berlin, and there is an open-air museum devoted to him and the Sachsenspiegel in his village of Reppichau. There are also schools named after Eike of Repgow in Halberstadt and Magdeburg. The Eike of Repgow prize, which comes with a statuette of Eike, a certificate, and 5,000 euros, is awarded jointly by awarded annually by the city of Magdeburg and the Otto von Guericke University of Magdeburg for academic work of a historical or legal nature.Eike von Repgow Preis Famous words The origin of the modern German saying \\"Wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst\\" (\\"first come, first served\\", literally he who comes first, grinds first) can be traced to Eike of Repgow, who wrote (in the Sachsenspiegel) Die ok irst to der molen kumt, die sal erst malen (in modern English: He who comes to the mill first shall grind first).

It centralized the handling of the center's data including offices, laboratories and test stations; and housed general instrumentation activities serving more than one launch complex.. The CIF also included the Central Timing Facility, where a precision clock drove countdown clocks and other timing devices at KSC that required a high degree of accuracy. The CIF also housed computers and other electronic equipment for reduction of telemetry data, analysis, and transmission to other NASA centers. The three-story structure of approximately just west of the KSC Headquarters Building was one of the most distinctive buildings in the KSC Industrial Area with its rooftop array of various antennas.. The CIF was left dormant during the intermediate part of the space shuttle program (as other facilities such as the launch control center managed most of the instrumentation in the 2000s), and fell into disrepair. In September 2017, all the equipment inside was donated to the visitor complex and storage facilities, while the disused building was eventually demolished in October.https://images.nasa.gov/details- KSC-20170925-MH- JBS01_0001-Timelapse_Central_Instrumentation_Facility_Demolition_H265-3162840 History The CIF in 1974The CIF reflected the desire of Karl Sendler, KSC's first director of information systems, and his planners to centralize data handling. Although it was based on systems developed during Saturn I operations at Complexes 34 and 37, such experience was of limited value, because the distance from Launch Complex 39 to its Launch Control Center was more than 14 times as long. Planning and construction were coordinated with other NASA centers and with the Atlantic Missile Range. All metal in the building was grounded, and commercial power and the instrumentation power systems were grounded separately. Fluorescent lights, a source of electromagnetic interference, were not permitted. Its architect, Charles Luckman, also designed other nearby buildings. CIF antenna site A smaller building, later known as the CIF antenna site, was placed 1.5 miles (2.5 km) north of the Industrial Area, to be free of radio-frequency interference and have clear line-of-sight to the NASA launch complexes.Bidgood to CE Jacksonville, \\"Central Instrumentation Facility, MILA,\\" 10 May 1963; B.

Background As part of NASA's recent directives to expand and modernize the space center industrial complex to allow greater potential in the next space exploration programs, the Kennedy Space Center management office (including Robert D. Cabana) contracted Orlando-based architects and engineers to design and build a new headquarters building to replace the deteriorating current (now former) building adjascent to the site.

However sadly due to a combination of material decay, rising electrical power costs, unattended and empty areas, and the hazardous asbestos lining the entire walls, it was deemed too costly to renovate. This building is in the process of being demolished and has been abandoned by NASA as of January 2020.

It was originally published as The Shadow in the Plate. Plot This second Sally Lockhart mystery takes place in late 1878, six years after the events of The Ruby in the Smoke. A Miss Walsh walks into the offices of Sally Lockhart's office (Sally is now working as a financial consultant) about some poor business advice Sally gave her; as a result Miss Walsh has lost her life savings. Sally vows to get the money back and investigate Anglo-Baltic, the company Miss Walsh lost all her money from. We also learn that Sally has a huge but lovable black dog called Chaka and that Frederick Garland (Sally's friend from The Ruby in the Smoke) is in love with Sally but that she is unsure of her feelings and so continuously refuses to decide on whether to marry him. Sally's friend Jim Taylor (now working as a stagehand in a local theatre) helps stage magician Alistair Mackinnon escape two men Mackinnon is certain plan to kill him. Jim takes Mackinnon to Frederick and Frederick's uncle Webster at their photography shop/private investigations office in Burton Street where Mackinnon proves to Jim, Webster and Frederick that he has spiritual abilities (he can see things having to do with an object by touching it) and tells them of a murder he saw by touching a man‚Äôs cigar case. Mackinnon tells them that he believes that the man knows that he (Mackinnon) knows about the murder, and is therefore terrified for his life. Jim and Frederick go to a spiritualist seance as part of their work as private detectives. The seance involves the table shaking from side to side and objects being thrown across the room; the medium (a Mrs. Nellie Budd) also has trance during which she says things that connect to a mysterious business tied up to Anglo-Baltic called North Star. Frederick manages to get a photography of Nellie's arms during the seance. Later, Frederick tells Sally what he has learnt. She tells him what she knows about the former owner of Anglo-Baltic and current owner of North Star, Axel Bellmann. Sally suspects that Bellman has manufactured Anglo-Baltic‚Äôs collapse to fund North Star; she believes him to be very vicious. Later that week, Mackinnon is to perform at a charity event. He asks Frederick to come with him for protection. Frederick asks his aristocratic friend Charles to come with him as Charles can tell Frederick who the people at the event are. While performing, Mackinnon sees the man he believes to be after him in the audience. He gets the message to Frederick leading Frederick to find out that this man is Axel Bellmann. Frederick and Charles also come across Lord Wytham and his ethereally beautiful daughter Lady Mary. Mackinnon disappears, much to Frederick and Charles's annoyance. At Sally‚Äôs office the next morning, Mr. Windlesham, an employee of Bellmann, tries to intimidate her and so stop her investigations into Bellmann but she refuses. In the meantime, we learn that Bellmann has made a deal with the almost-bankrupt Lord Wytham: if Bellmann marries Lady Mary Wytham, Lord Wytham's debts will be paid off. Wytham, repulsed by the deal, sees no option but to accept: if he does not, he will go to debtor's prison. Meanwhile, Frederick goes to Nellie to show her his photograph from the seance: it shows her using fake arms as well as wires to cause the table to move and the objects to be thrown. She responds cheerfully, but agrees to tell him more about her trances (which she claims are genuine). She cannot remember what happens during them; she has had them since she was young; she used to have them while her identical twin sister Jessie Saxon never did. Frederick tells her what she said during her trance. She says it sounds like nonsense and is surprised that he takes it seriously. Sally visits Bellmann and orders him to pay her Miss Walsh's lost money but he refuses. Unfortunately for Nellie, Sally drops Nellie's business card in Bellmann's office. Jim goes to look for Mackinnon and meets a woman called Isabel Meredith. She tells Jim that she is desperately in love in Mackinnon but knows he cannot be with her. She also tells Jim where Mackinnon is. Meanwhile, Charles discovers that Bellmann and Lady Mary Wytham are engaged. When investigating, Jim meets Lady Mary and immediately falls in love with her. She tells him that she cannot marry Bellmann and he gives her his card. Later, Isabel's room is ransacked by Bellmann's henchmen. Frightened, she tells them where Mackinnon will be performing but Frederick, Sally and Jim are able to save him by allowing him to get away from that venue so he is not harmed. Before he escapes, Sally demands he tell her the real reason Bellmann is after him. He tells her that he is Nellie Budd's son by Lord Wytham but then runs away from her (as well as the henchmen) before she can find out more. Isabel comes to stay in Burton Street. Frederick goes to see Nellie again but finds she has been attacked. She is taken to a hospital for treatment; there is doubt over whether she will survive. Windlesham pays a hitman to kill Sally. Meanwhile, Sally finds out that North Star is a weapons company that plans to build a massive \\"Steam Gun\\" capable of shooting thousands of bullets at once. Frederick learns how the Steam Gun works and comes across Nellie's sister Jessie in the north of England. He tells Jessie about Nellie's injury and Jessie tells him that Mackinnon is not Nellie's son but Nellie's lover. Jessie decides to go to Nellie. Frederick learns from a hostel owner that Mackinnon is married to Lady Mary Wytham. It becomes clear that Bellmann knows this and that is why Bellmann is trying to kill Mackinnon. It becomes clear that Nellie was not Mackinnon's lover and that it was Nellie who made Mackinnon's and Lady Mary's marriage possible. Windlesham‚Äôs hitman tries to kill Sally but, unbeknownst to him, the woman he tries to kill is really Isabel and his knife gets stuck in her underclothing. He kills Chaka instead (and is himself killed) and Sally is devastated by Chaka's loss. Next day, Sally goes into her office to find it ransacked. Neither her landlord nor the police are helpful. Sally asks Frederick to help; Frederick and Jim manage to retrieve the stolen files from Bellmann's house. Sally realises that the Steam Gun is for use against one's own population. Jim (now aware of Lady Mary's marriage) meets Lady Mary in Hyde Park; they talk and, on impulse, briefly kiss. He advises her to make her marriage to Mackinnon public and she tells him where Mackinnon is hiding. Sally tells Isabel that Mackinnon is married, leaving Isabel quietly devastated. Jim and Frederick go to see Mackinnon and find him being attacked by Bellmann's henchmen. Jim and Frederick fight, with a moment of instrumental help from Mackinnon, against the henchmen, eventually knocking them out. They tie them up and send them in a cab to a police station. Mackinnon comes back to Burton Street. After everyone but Sally and Frederick are left alone together (with a brief interruption). Sally tells Frederick that she loves him and takes him upstairs whispering \\"Not a word - not a word.\\" They sleep together, and afterwards Sally lets Frederick ask her to marry him, and agrees. Meanwhile, Windlesham and Bellmann have set fire to the building. Jim smells it and warns everyone else. Everyone climbs out of the window (Jim falls and breaks his leg) apart from Isabel who refuses to leave her room. Frederick climbs back up to save her but she refuses to move and the ceiling collapses, killing them both. After Frederick's body is found after the fire, Sally walks around in a daze. Unknowingly, she goes to the North Star headquarters and tells Bellmann that she is there to see him. Back in London, despite Jim‚Äôs broken leg, he manages to walk to where Mackinnon is staying. Mackinnon sees where Sally is using his psychic powers and Jim makes him come to the North Star headquarters. Back at the North Star, Sally tells Bellmann that she loved Frederick and that Bellmann killed him. Bellmann tells Sally that he wants power and that he believes the Steam Gun will give it to him. He asks her to marry him, telling her that he thinks her a better match for him than Lady Mary would have been. At that moment, Mackinnon comes in to bring Sally to Jim. Sally tells Mackinnon to wait before agreeing to marry Bellmann in exchange for the money Miss Walsh lost from the collapse of Anglo-Baltic. Bellmann gives the money to Sally who tells Mackinnon to take it to Miss Walsh. Mackinnon takes the money to Jim and Jim suspects Sally has a plan. At Sally‚Äôs request, Bellmann takes her to see the Steam Gun. While chiding Bellmann for his failure to understand people like Frederick, Sally sets the Steam Gun off, killing Bellmann. Sally survives and is rescued by Jim and Mackinnon from the rubble. Bellmann's death is reported as a tragic accident; Miss Walsh gets her money and insists in investing it in Garland & Lockhart (the photography firm Sally helped set up); it transpires that Jim will walk with a limp for the rest of his life thanks to his efforts to rescue Sally when his leg was broken; Nellie Budd recovers and decides to go back to the north with Jessie; and Mackinnon and Lady Mary leave England to go to America. In the spring of the next year, Charles shows Sally, Webster and Jim a possible new location for Garland & Lockhart after the fire. It is beautiful and spacious with a large orchard; the only drawback being that it is apparently haunted. They decide to take it and Charles gives Sally a photograph he had taken near the beginning of the novel of Frederick. The novel closes with Sally's announcement that she is pregnant with Frederick's child. TV adaptation A BBC TV Movie adaptation starring Billie Piper as Sally Lockhart, JJ Feild as Fred Garland, Jared Harris as Axel Bellmann and Matt Smith as Jim Taylor. It was partly filmed in Kent at The Historic Dockyard Chatham. It was broadcast in the UK on 30 December 2007 on BBC1.BBC - Drama - The Shadow in the North It also aired in the United States on the PBS station Masterpiece Mystery! under the title The Sally Lockhart Mysteries: The Shadow in the North. All four Sally Lockhart books were expected to be adapted for television; however, as of March 2014, no information has arisen regarding an adaptation of The Tiger in the Well.  Allusions to history  The character of Hopkinson/Nordenfels seems to be based on Swedish inventor Thorsten Nordenfelt, particularly his move from Sweden to England, his investment in British railway technology and the development of the Nordenfelt gun which all have parallels in the book. Perhaps coincidentally, there were also armoured trains of Poland. There are also significant similarities between the character of Axel Bellmann and Swedish industrialist Axel Wenner- Gren - not least, nationality, millionaire status, connection to industrialisation and first name. It is likely Wenner-Gren was a Nazi agent and sympathiser.

Plot This book takes place in the autumn of 1881. Sally Lockhart has a daughter named Harriet, a nurse named Sarah-Jane and a cook named Ellie. Her friends Webster, Jim and Charles are in South America taking pictures. One day a divorce affidavit arrives at the house. Sally, who has never been married, is confused that a commission agent named Arthur Parrish claims he is her husband and Harriet's father. The affidavit says that Harriet's \\"father\\" wants custody of her. She takes it to her lawyer and gets no sympathy from him; she is only a woman after all and has no power, with the lawyer preferring to focus on the charges Parrish has used to try and claim custody of Harriet rather than whether or not Sally was actually married to him in the first place. The scene shifts to Russian Jews getting off a boat entering England. A German Socialist journalist named Jacob Liebermann goes to the League of the Democratic Socialist Association. He meets Dan Goldberg, another Socialist journalist like himself, and Jacob tells Dan about a paralysed man called the Tzaddik who is manipulating things so the Jewish people are hurt economically and physically. He also mentions the name Parrish, which Dan recognises, as being involved. The next day, Sally tells her friend and employee Margaret Haddow everything that has happened. Margaret goes to Parrish's office and tries to spy on him, but he realises that she is an employee of Sally's and tells her so. Sally goes to the church where she supposedly married Parrish and finds an intact record of their wedding. She also finds that the priest that supposedly married them is now retired under a cloud of suspicion. Sally decides to write to Harriet's aunt Rosa, who is married to a clergyman, so she can find out more about the priest. Meanwhile, Dan Goldberg has arranged for an employee of Parrish to be robbed. Dan looks at a notebook that was stolen from that employee and learns about the case against Sally. The next day, Sally has an argument with her lawyer on how much he is contributing to her case. After that, Sally goes out and buys a revolver. That night, someone comes into her house and takes Harriet's teddy bear. Soon, Sally goes to ask Parrish's neighbours about him but they shut their doors to her. She finds out that the same priest that ‚Äúmarried‚Äù the pair of them also recommended Parrish to the vicar of where he lives now. Sally goes home, bewildered, to find Rosa there waiting for her. They discuss the case and realise that Parrish wants Harriet and that Parrish has forged everything so he can have her. Parrish and Sally have meetings with their lawyers, leaving the former satisfied and the latter angry. On Sally's way home, one of Goldberg's employees tries to talk to her but she thinks that he is one of Parrish's men and threatens to shoot him. Over the weekend, she goes to Rosa's house and she and her husband Nicholas Bedwell promise to do all they can. Sally goes to a meeting with her barrister and he is very rude to her and tells her that there is no chance of winning, having not even read the papers in sufficient depth to determine that the child involved is a girl. In the courtroom, the case is over before it is begun because Sally does not show up. Custody of Harriet and all of Sally's money shifts over to Arthur Parrish. Sally plans to hide and fight back. She and Harriet change from their first boarding house in a day because of a disagreement with the landlady. Mr. Parrish steals all of Sally's money from her bank account without her knowledge and then hires an inquiry agent to find Sally. The inquiry agent goes to Sally's office and discovers a letter sent by Sally from her current boarding house. Margaret realises that he knows and sends a message for Sally to leave. Sally has to find another place for shelter but she can't find one right away. She has to sell her father's watch for only a few extra coins. Sally finally takes refuge on a park bench but a man named Morris Katz tells her to come with him to somewhere safe. The safe place ends up being a Social Mission. Sally volunteers to work for their shelter. We see the Tzaddik and his servant Michelet arrive at their home in Spitalfields, London. The Tzaddik is told about Sally's case and he says that it is excellent that she lost. The next morning, Sally sees many social problems when she is working for the Mission. Morris Katz comes back and takes Sally to Soho where she meets Dan Goldberg. Goldberg tells Sally that Parrish is a criminal, involved with many scams including prostitution houses and exploitation of Jewish people. He also tells her about the Tzaddik and she realises that the Tzaddik is the one who wants Harriet. The Tzaddik blackmails a police officer to arrest Dan Goldberg and find Sally Lockhart. Soon, Sally gets three letters: one from Sarah-Jane, one from Nicholas Bedwell and one from Daniel Goldberg, who had brought them all. Sarah-Jane says that policemen have been searching the house, Nicholas tells Sally that he found the priest that she was looking for, and Goldberg says that he was sorry to have missed Sally. Sally follows up on Nicholas's lead and finds the priest right where Nicholas said he was. Sally interrogates the priest but he shuts her out. Another priest tells Sally that he has noticed that the priest that married Parrish and Sally is addicted to opium, providing obvious blackmail opportunity that Sally's unknown enemies could use to make him work for them. The next day, Margaret informs Sally that she has found a wonderful lawyer, Mr. Wentworth, by chance. Sally wants to know if he can take on her case and Margaret tells her that she has to come out of hiding first. Before Sally can reply, Goldberg comes and requests her assistance in rescuing a girl named Rebecca Meyer who knows things about the Tzaddik from being forced to go to a prostitution house. She does so successfully. They go to the Katz's house where Morris, his wife and his daughter Leah are waiting. Rebecca says that Dutch seems to be the Tzaddik's native language, he tortures his servants, he needs a monkey to help him and he uses whistles to control mobs, forcing them to attack Jewish homes and businesses in Russia. She used to be friends with one of the maidservants before the maidservant disappeared which is how she knows. Suddenly, police raid the Katz's looking for Goldberg, who is not there. They say that Goldberg is a murderer but when they leave, Katz explains that countries other than England make up false charges when the real charges have to do with politics. Rebecca has brought a label from the Tzaddik's luggage all the way from Russia. The label belongs to a Mr. Lee and Sally realises that it is all linked to her. She decides to find Mr. Wentworth to ask him if he will be Goldberg's lawyer. Mr. Wentworth agrees but he is not sure what will happen to Sally if she continues to hide from the police. Sally has a plan. She chops off her hair and goes to the Katz's again. She takes Harriet this time, having previously left her at the mission. The three women at the Katz's dye Sally's hair with henna. Sally says goodbye to Harriet and goes to infiltrate the Tzaddik's house. Sally becomes a maid in the Tzaddik's house. She learns the order of things, the two sets of servants, the servers and the Tzaddik's personal servants. Later, she meets Michelet, the Tzaddik's valet who hits on her immediately. She learns that the Tzaddik has a monkey that waits on him hand and foot. Meanwhile, Margaret meets with Mr. Wentworth who is starting to realise all of the odds are against Sally. Sarah-Jane comes in and tells Margaret that they have been kicked out of their house. Mr. Katz's apprentice tells Goldberg what Sally is doing. Late at night, Sally eavesdrops on the Tzaddik's secretary and Michelet fighting over how Harriet would be trained to replace the monkey that currently does a lot for the Tzaddik. Sally is understandably horrified. She goes back to her room but Michelet is waiting for her there. She lies and says that she didn't hear anything but Michelet is not sure. The next morning, Mr. Parrish visits the Tzaddik. Sally tries to eavesdrop but hears nothing. Goldberg holds a meeting to solve some of the injustices being caused against the Jews. Among the people in the meeting is a gang leader named Kid Mendel who helps Goldberg keep order. Parrish finds out where Harriet is as he spreads nasty rumours about the Jews. Goldberg plans to keep a watch on Harriet and Sally but before he is done, Parrish has stolen Harriet. Goldberg gets four groups out looking for Harriet. Sally confronts the Tzaddik and realises that the Tzaddik is really Ah Ling, who she last confronted and shot over a decade ago; she caused his paralysis when her shot went through his spine. Sally tries to kill him again but she fails. She is taken to the cellar in the darkness but not before she steals a page from a ledger showing the illegal activities going on. Goldberg finds the house where Harriet is and takes a gang of teens in to get her out. They succeed, albeit one of the teens, a girl named Bridie, becomes unconscious and Dan is left behind with a bullet in his arm. Parrish has a lot of explaining to do to the police officer that covers the incident, because he is the one who shot Goldberg. Goldberg is taken into custody. One of Goldberg's other watch-groups asks the Tzaddik's secretary where Harriet is and he realises that they don't know. He reports this to the Tzaddik and they call the police. Then the Tzaddik and Michelet go down to the cellar to see Sally. Meanwhile, two boys spring Goldberg out of the van where he is being taken to jail in and the bullet in his arm is taken out. He tells the boys who freed him to go find Harriet. Sally interrogates the Tzaddik when he comes to see her, even though she is in no position to. She then lectures him about evil. The Tzaddik then tells Sally that Parrish has Harriet. Suddenly, a flood breaks through the cellar wall. Michelet drowns instantly but Sally, for reasons unknown to herself, tries to save the Tzaddik while the house collapses. Dan is stopping a riot when the police catch up with him. Before he is taken away, he is told that the Tzaddik's house just collapsed. The Tzaddik tells Sally a story about when a tiger was stuck in a village's well. They prayed to their gods for rain and the rain drowned the tiger. The Tzaddik is reminded of that story by the current situation but he doesn't say which of them is the tiger in the present situation. Suddenly, the Tzaddik convulses and dies. The gang with Harriet and the unconscious Bridie stops in a place for a while. Bridie wakes up and takes care of Harriet until the owner of the place tells them to leave. The owner realises that Harriet doesn't belong with them so he tells a policeman. The other two boys get to the same place that Harriet and her entourage just left, so they are arrested for baby stealing. Sarah-Jane is standing outside of their house when Jim arrives. She explains everything that is going on to him and he starts to go to the house. Kid Mendel stops him and offers his help and his side of the story. Jim takes the advice and they go in the house and start throwing Mr. Parrish's stuff out the window. When Mr. Parrish tries to stop them, Sarah-Jane drops a chamber pot on his head. Kid Mendel hears that the house where Sally is collapsed so he and Jim go to investigate. Jim arrives just in time to see Sally rescued from the ruins. She gives him the page from the ledger that she‚Äôd hid and asks where Harriet is. She is immediately put in medical care. The two boys are released from jail because they couldn't charge them with anything. They go to where the other group is and report where Harriet is to be found. Jim goes there as soon as possible and brings Harriet home. Mr. Wentworth wins Sally's appeal with all of the new evidence. Sally decides that she wants to marry Dan Goldberg as she considers him to be her equal.

He is best known for his project The New American Poetry 1945-1960 (1960), one of the anthologies of contemporary American writing he released.  Early life  Allen began his working life as a Japanese translator within the US military, serving during WWII.  Career  After his service ended, Allen became an editor at Grove Press, where he worked for 16 years. He was one of the first translators of the Romanian-French Absurdist playwright Eug√®ne Ionesco, and Allen's 1958 volume Four Plays of Eug√®ne Ionesco helped to introduce the playwright to American audiences in the 1960s. Along with editing works by Lew Welch, Allen edited Frank O'Hara, including Collected Poems (1971; 1991) and Selected Poems (1974). He is referred to directly in O'Hara's \\"Personal Poem\\" which is in Lunch Poems, a book Allen also edited. O'Hara writes, in reference to a conversation he had with LeRoi Jones, \\"we don't like Lionel Trilling/we decide, we like Don Allen.\\" John Rechy records in his memoirs that Allen offered him the contract to publish City of Night. In 1960, Allen moved from New York to San Francisco, where he established Grey Fox Press and the Four Seasons Foundation, two literary presses where he continued to publish works from Beat, San Francisco Renaissance, Black Mountain, and New York School writers. As the CEO of Grey Fox Press, he published works by Jack Spicer, along with Enough Said (1980) by Philip Whalen, and I Remain (1980), a collection of Welch's letters. Other authors published by Grey Fox Press included Richard Brautigan, Robert Duncan, Jack Kerouac, Joanne Kyger, Philip Lamantia, Charles Olson, John Rechy, Michael Rumaker, Aaron Shurin, and Gary Snyder. Also in 1960, Allen edited the anthology The New American Poetry. In that book, released through Grey Fox Press, Allen included \\"Statements of Poetics,\\" which was an experimental aesthetics discussion from Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Whalen, Snyder, Michael McClure, Jones, John Wieners, along with Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. While working with the Four Seasons Foundation, Allen also assisted in the publication of (among others): Interviews (1980) by Edward Dorn, A Quick Graph: Collected Notes and Essays (1970) by Robert Creeley, and The Graces (1983) by Aaron Shurin. In 1997, Allen helped edit, along with Benjamin Friedlander, the Collected Prose of Charles Olson (University of California Press).  Grey Fox Press  Grey Fox Press and Four Seasons Foundation were among the many emerging presses that City Lights distributed in the late 1960s, and when Don Allen began thinking about retirement, City Lights offered to acquire the backlists. Today, City Lights publishes the significant works from these presses in their City Lights/Grey Fox series. The Donald Allen Collection, processed in 1991 for a special collection series at the UC San Diego library, contains materials which Allen published through the Four Seasons Foundation and Grey Fox Press. The papers document Allen's editing and publishing works dating from 1957 to 1975, although some material is from the 1930s.

It is located at 3150 Ocean Drive. On August 6, 1994, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The Driftwood Inn was opened in 1937, conceived and constructed by local Vero Beach eccentric and businessman Waldo E. Sexton. The hotel and resort were continually expanded throughout the years, and the property is now a partial interval ownership/timeshare along with being a traditional hotel. Waldo E. Sexton (1885-1967) built the two buildings which comprise the Driftwood Inn and Restaurant in 1935. Waldo has been called ‚Äúone of the most colorful persons that Florida has ever known,‚Äù an ‚Äúimaginative entrepreneur,‚Äù and an ‚Äúoutrageous, old time eccentric.‚Äù He moved to Florida in 1914 and began his legacy that includes several buildings still standing in Vero Beach today and was an integral partner in the development of McKee Jungle Garden, also in Vero Beach. Driftwood Inn and Restaurant was originally a private beach house called the ‚ÄúBreezeway‚Äù by its owners, Waldo & Elsebeth Sexton, because of the opening in the central portion of the first floor. Construction of the house began in about 1935 and was completed in 1937. Two rooms originally flanked the first floor. A kitchen was located on the second floor, over the breezeway. A balcony extended across the second floor. Brick chimneys also flanked the breezeway. According to family members, a coiled pipe, ‚Äúsolar unit‚Äù was contained between the chimneys to provide heated water, and in fact original pictures in the reception area of the Inn today show those solar panels . The original beach house was expanded in late 1937 by the addition of a wing on the north and the south wing was added in 1939. The original portion of the building is now the central section. The building is distinguished by board and batten exterior walls, wood shingled gable ends with decorative truss work and rustic balcony railings. The courtyard is marked by two stone walls, into which are embedded two rusty, ancient cannons. Ceramic tiles decorate the courtyard floor. A breezeway is at the east end of the courtyard and is flanked by stairs leading to the second floor. The hallway at the north end features a small mural of a Spanish explorer landing in the new world. The breezeway walls feature graffiti from visitors, applied ornaments and portions of a wood mantel. Though originally built as a family home, within a short time it was being operated by Mrs. Waldo Sexton as a small resort hotel and because there was no restaurant in the vicinity of the Driftwood Inn, Mrs. Sexton began to cook breakfast for the guests in the family kitchen. This success led eventually to the founding of the adjacent restaurant. Waldo's Restaurant was constructed in 1947. The main entrance to the restaurant is recessed and located adjacent to the breezeway building. The doors have multiple panels, insets and decorative ceramic tiles. Ornate metal grills also decorate the entrance area. The balcony is railed with turned spindles, part of the original design. Three immense ‚Äòoutrigger‚Äù type wood timbers decorate the south end of the building. The restaurant interior still retains some original features, such as wood paneled walls and ceramic tile insets in the floor. Today both the Breezeway and Waldo's Restaurant, maintain their basic integrity, their unusual workmanship and materials and their original design features. They are a unique example of vernacular architecture in which Waldo was able to express his exuberant personality. Waldo was a world traveler and a passionate collector. He incorporated into the buildings and grounds of the inn and restaurant hundreds of artifacts that he obtained from various trips. The visual display of these items was the exuberant Waldo's way of sharing his collection of the beautiful and unusual. Part of the timber used to build the Driftwood was salvaged by Waldo from a barn blown down in a hurricane. Waldo was especially fond of bells and amassed a collection of 250 of various types and sizes, collecting them from churches, trains, ships and schools, just to mention a few. They dominate the exterior of the buildings and have always been a special part of the Driftwood Inn tradition. They were used to welcome guests on their arrival and to ring out a farewell on their departure. Waldo continued to expand the Driftwood complex after erecting the inn and restaurant. A small office was built in 1949. In that year he also moved in a row of fishing shacks that were used for guest rooms and later, for small shops. They were converted back into guests rooms in 1986. In 1963 a 15 unit apartment building was added, just west of the original Breezeway building. Waldo's son, Ralph, erected the four story building to the south in 1965, providing more apartment units. Two more apartment buildings are now part of the Driftwood Resort, and all apartments and guests rooms on the property were converted to interval ownership in 1979. The Driftwood Inn and Waldo's Restaurant feature a rustic ‚Äúbeachcomber‚Äù ambiance. While structures of similar style may be found elsewhere in Florida, few are comparable in scale or complexity of detail The two original buildings are unique in the Vero Beach area and continue to serve their historic function of providing accommodations and amenities for tourists. Both were added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The inn and restaurant continue to operate today, renting rooms to the public on a daily or weekly basis and serving lunch and dinner poolside and Oceanside from Waldo's Restaurant. Two hurricanes in 2004 did substantial damage to the property but it reopened in 2005 and retained all the history and ambiance it has always had. With the help of local architect, John Dean and longtime property manager, Jeanne Radlet, the buildings were restored and stand today as a testament to Waldo Sexton, the entrepreneur and eclectic individual that built these structures nearly a century ago.

Ackley in the early 1950s. He created this non-factory (wildcat) offering by simply necking-down the .22 Hornet to .17 caliber and fire-forming the resized cases in his new chamber design. The result was a small quiet cartridge capable of high velocity. Ackley mentions it as one of the most balanced of the .17 cartridges of his time; likely, this is still true.Cartridges of the World 8th Edition, Book by Frank C. Barnes, DBI Books, 1997, Sixty years later, the Hornady Manufacturing Company (Grand Island, Nebraska, US) turned Ackley's idea into a commercial product with a similar cartridge; the .17 Hornady Hornet uses a 20 grain (1.3 gram) \\"Superformance\\" V-max projectile with a published velocity of 3,650fps (1,113 metres/second). However, the new standardized ammunition and brass is not built to exactly the same dimensional specifications as the original wildcat or the dimensions listed on this page. Hornady's standard has a shorter body with less taper and shorter overall case length while the overall loaded length remains that of the original .22 Hornet (in order to fit the standard Hornet magazines). Shooters using the .17 Hornady Hornet in a .17 Ackley Hornet chamber experience the bullet jumping to the rifling and losing some of the inherent accuracy for which the cartridge has been known. It has been reported the .17 Hornady Hornet uses a thicker rim than the original Hornet case. However, the ninth edition of the Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading shows them to be the same (.065 inches); measuring the rims of actual factory cases shows the Hornady handbook to be correct. Moreover, Ackley's Pocket Manual for Shooters and Reloaders shows the rim thickness for his wildcat to range between .069\\" and .063\\" which is consistent with the Hornady handbook. Both cartridges head-space on this rim. While the Ackley cartridge uses a 30-degree shoulder angle and the Hornady is 25 degrees, its longer shoulder is accommodated by Ackley's longer case body. Fireforming moves the Hornady's shoulder forward at the expense of neck length. There is another size issue: according to Ackley's manual, his wildcat cartridge is only .289\\" over the shoulder while the Hornady factory round measures .294\\". This is the reason the Hornady's case capacity is almost identical to that of the Ackley's. Since there is five-thousandths less taper in the case body, the new .17 Hornady Hornet cases may not fit an Ackley chamber without full-length resizing. Existing rifles chambered for the Ackley wildcat can have their barrels set back one turn and rechambered to the new .17 Hornady Hornet which meets the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) standard for the .17 Hornet. This fixes the bullet jump issue and improves ammunition availability with little risk of diminished performance.

Toponomy The z in Hiz is a Domesday-Book abbreviation for ts (or tch),Johnston, James B., The Place- Names of England and Wales, London, 1915, p. 305 and Hiz is properly pronounced \\"Hitch\\". This fact seems to be little known, and Hiz is now normally said as it is spelled. It may take its name from the Hicce tribe, who inhabited the area and gave their name to Hitchin. Ekwall says that Hiz/Hitch is a probably back-formation from Hitchin, which in turn is the dative plural of Hicce. Norden says the name is derived from a wood called Hitch, but Ekwall believes this is a conflation with Wychwood, for which the Old English is Hwiccawudu.

Life  Mary Jane Patterson was the oldest of Henry Irving Patterson and Emeline Eliza (Taylor) Patterson's children. There is conflicting data on how many siblings she had, but most sources cite between seven and ten. Henry Patterson worked as a bricklayer and plasterer who gained his freedom, after Mary was born, in 1852. After this, he moved his family north to Ohio. The Pattersons settled in Oberlin, Ohio, in 1856. Oberlin had a large community of black families; some were freed slaves and some were fugitive slaves. Oberlin was popular because it had a racially integrated co-ed college. Henry Patterson worked as a master mason, and for many years the family boarded large numbers of black students in their home.  Teaching career  Her home in Washington D.C. After graduation Patterson was listed as teaching in Chillicothe, Ohio. On September 21, 1864, she applied for a position in Norfolk, Virginia at a school for black children. On October 7, 1864, E. H. Fairchild, principal of Oberlin College's preparatory department from 1853 to 1869, wrote a recommendation for an \\"appointment from the American missionary Association as a ... teacher among freedmen.\\" In this letter he described her as \\"a light quadroon, a graduate of this college, a superior scholar, a good singer, a faithful Christian, and a genteel lady. She had success is teaching and is worthy of the highest ... you pay to ladies.\\"Smith, Jessie Carney. \\"Mary Jane Patterson.\\" Notable Black Women, Book 1. Gale Research 1992.

She served as the school's first Black principal, from 1871 to 1872. Patterson was demoted and served as assistant principal under Richard Theodore Greener, the first black Harvard University graduate. She was reappointed from 1873 to 1884. During her administration, the school grew from less than 50 to 172 students, the name \\"Preparatory High School\\" was dropped, high school commencements were initiated, and a teacher-training department was added to the school. Patterson's commitment to thoroughness as well as her \\"forceful\\" and \\"vivacious\\" personality helped her establish the school's strong intellectual standards.\\"Mary Jane Patterson, Pioneering Educator Born\\" African American Registry.. Patterson continued to teach at the High School until her death. While in D.C., Patterson lived with her sisters, Emma and Chanie, and her brother, John at 1532 Fifteenth Street Northwest.

Other pursuits  Patterson was also a humanitarian and was active in many organizations. She devoted time and money to Black institutions in Washington, D. C.

The perimeter track was in length and this and the runways had a concrete screed finish. Mark II airfield lighting was installed, two T-2 hangars were erected for major aircraft maintenance, and dispersed temporary building accommodation provided for some 2400 men in the wooded countryside of the estate to the south-west of the airfield. During construction, of soil were excavated, of soakaway drains installed and of concrete laid. A major overhead power line had to be put underground to clear the flying approaches. USAAF use The airfield was laid out on agricultural land between the two settlements of Rackheath Parva and Rackheath Magna. The airfield was given USAAF designation Station 145. 467th Bombardment Group (Heavy) The airfield was opened on 11 March 1944 and was used by the 467th Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Wendover AAF Utah. The 467th was assigned to the 96th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-P\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 788th Bombardment Squadron (X7) * 789th Bombardment Squadron (6A) * 790th Bombardment Squadron (Q2) * 791st Bombardment Squadron (4Z) The group flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign.

Ford B-24H-25-FO Liberator Serial 42-95234 \\"Weiser Witch\\" of the 788th Bomb Squadron. This aircraft crash landed at RAF Bungay on 5 May 1945 after fire in the nose. In combat, the unit served chiefly as a strategic bombardment organization, attacking the German navy harbor at Kiel, chemical plants at Bonn, textile factories at Stuttgart, power plants at Hamm, steel works at Osnabr√ºck, the aircraft industry at Brunswick, and other objectives. In addition to strategic operations, it was engaged occasionally in support and interdiction missions. It bombed shore installations and bridges near Cherbourg on D-Day, 6 June 1944. It struck enemy troop and supply concentrations near Montreuil on 25 July 1944 to assist the Allied drive across France. In September, over two weeks the bombers flew gasoline from Rackheath to a forward base at Clastres in France for use by the US mechanized forces. Attacked German communications and fortifications during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945. To assist the Allied assault across the Rhine in March 1945 it attacked enemy transportation. The group flew its last combat mission on 25 April 1945 and then returned to the US to Sioux Falls AAF South Dakota during June and July 1945. Subsequently the 467th was redesignated as the 467th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses in preparation for the planned invasion of Japan. The 467th was inactivated on 4 August 1946. The airfield was returned to the Royal Air Force and a number of units were posted here: * No. 94 Maintenance Unit RAF * No. 231 Maintenance Unit RAF Current use Commercial use of former T2 hangar The control tower renovated for use as offices With the end of the war, the airfield was closed permanently in late 1945 and the airfield site was returned to farming use. Very little of the runways, perimeter track, or hardstands now remain. Most of the concrete has been broken up for aggregate. The technical site has become the Rackheath Industrial Estate with several of the wartime buildings being modified or extended, and used for light industry. The major access road on the estate was named Wendover Road to commemorate the airbase in the US where the 467th Bomb Group was formed. Other roads carry related names, including one after Albert Shower the base commander, \\"Witchcraft Way\\" after an individual aircraft of the group, and \\"Liberator Close\\". The control tower still exists has been converted to use as an administrative building. The T-2 hangar nearby is virtually beyond recognition as compared to how it looked in 1943. Brickwork has been added to the front and the whole building has been repainted cream and green. Inside the building the roof girders appear to be original and identical to those seen on photographs taken in 1944. The other hangar, on the eastern side of the airfield, was dismantled many years ago. A memorial to the 467th Bomb Group consisting of a plaque and a bench was dedicated in 1983, and is situated near the Rackheath village sign on the Salhouse Road, adjacent to the Holy Trinity Church.

Calhoon began working with .19 caliber after his interest was piqued from learning about British sub-caliber rifle trials in the early 1970s. .19 caliber rifles have thicker rifling than .17 and .20 caliber rifles, which helps the barrel stay clean longer and improves barrel life. Variants .19 Calhoon Hornet The .19 Calhoon Hornet is a .19 caliber rifle wildcat cartridge. The cartridge is based on a necked-down blown-out .22 Hornet cartridge. This provides less stretching, and greater case capacity with a lighter bullet. The result is a flatter trajectory when compared to the .22 Hornet. Having a larger bore than the .17 caliber centerfires helps mitigate some of the fouling problems that rifles in that caliber tend to have. .19-223 The .19-223 is the second in a set of .19 caliber rounds created by James Calhoon. The cartridge is based on a necked-down .223 Remington cartridge. This gives higher velocity and a flatter trajectory than would be found with typical .223 loads. .19 Badger The .19 Badger is the third (currently in 2007 the latest) of the .19 caliber rounds created by Calhoon. This was an attempt to take the best features of his earlier cartridges the .19 Calhoon Hornet and the .19-223 and create a very powerful and efficient cartridge. This cartridge is based on the rimless .30 M1 Carbine case, which has almost the same rim diameter as a .22 Hornet but has fewer potential feeding problems in some rifles because of the lack of a rim.

Collectively with certain other species of shark, it is known as \\"tollo\\". Description The speckled smooth-hound is a robust shark with a moderately long, blunt snout, small eyes, short mouth and molar-like teeth without cusps. The trailing edge of the dorsal fins have small, pointed projections. The pectoral fins are large and the pelvic fins moderately large. The caudal peduncle is short and the lower lobe of the tail fin is narrow and slightly curved. The maximum length is about with maturity being reached by males at about and females at about . Adults are grey or greyish-brown above and paler below, liberally speckled with white spots. Juveniles have dark bars. Distribution The speckled smooth-hound is found off the Pacific coast of South America, including the Galapagos Islands and the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. Its range extends from the Isla Lobos de Tierra in Peru to the southern tip of Chile. It is a demersal fish and swims close to the seabed on the continental shelf at depths of between .

It is managed and co-owned by Pacific Retail Capital Partners. The mall opened in 1984 with four anchors ‚Äî Jackson-based McRae's, Gayfers, D.H. Holmes, and JCPenney. Northpark also has a cinema located in the back of the mall, originally a 10-screen operation, which later expanded to a 14-screen state-of-the-art setup under Regal Entertainment Group's United Artists Theatres brand but was sold in September 2018 and officially closed in early 2019. The mall was built by Cadillac Fairview, who sold it to Mills Corporation in 2003. Northpark's initial success took most of the remaining business from the struggling Jackson Mall, south of the Madison-Hinds county line, which had opened in 1969 with three anchors. JCPenney and Gayfers were two, both relocating to Northpark in 1985, while Woolco closed prior to Northpark's opening. Jackson Mall has since been redeveloped as a medical mall, providing health care for the inner city urban poor. Northpark Mall's former direct competition was Metrocenter Mall, which was built in southwest Jackson in 1978 and closed in 2018, and the Outlets of Mississippi in nearby Pearl just south of the city by the intersection of I-55 & I-20. The Outlets shopping center was completed in 2013. Other competitors include Dogwood Festival Market and Market Street Flowood which are across from each other at Lakeland Drive (MS 25) and East Metro Parkway in Flowood. In the midst of a volatile local market, a downturn came at Metrocenter in April 1999 when its Gayfers anchor closed due to the Dillard's buyout of Gayfers' parent company, Mercantile Stores. Another blow came in 2004 when Dillard's announced they were closing its Metrocenter location, and consolidating operations to its Northpark properties ‚Äî anchor spaces at the ends of the mall's north and south wings, acquired via D. H. Holmes and Gayfers. A third anchor conversion came in March 2006, as all McRae's stores, including the store at Northpark and Metrocenter, were rebranded by Belk. Both the McRae's and Proffitt's chains had been purchased by Belk in late 2005. Belk of Metrocenter Mall was closed in August 2009. This will boost patronage at the Northpark and Dogwood Festival locations.

History Attlebridge airfield had runways of 1,220, 1,120 and 1,080 yards length but, when the base was earmarked for USAAF use, these were extended and the airfield was enlarged to meet heavy bomber requirements. The main E-W runway was increased to 2,000 yards and the others to 1,400 yards each. The perimeter track was also extended and the number of hardstands was increased to fifty. In enlarging the airfield, several small, country roads were closed in the parish of Weston Longville, in which the larger part of the airfield was sited. RAF Bomber Command use Attlebridge was an early wartime station, laid out for use by No. 2 Group RAF light bombers, and was completed in August 1942. The airfield was used by No. 88 Squadron RAF from August 1941 to September 1942 using Bristol Blenheim IVs and Douglas Bostons. United States Army Air Forces use Attlebridge was assigned to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Eighth Air Force's 2nd Bomb Wing on 30 September 1942. It was given USAAF designation Station 120. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Attlebridge were: * 472rd Sub-Depot (VIII Air Force Service Command) * 18th Weather Squadron * 61st Station Complement Squadron Regular Army Station Units included: * 1233rd Quartermaster Company * 1452nd Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 82nd Chemical Company (Air Operations) * 2104th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon * 207th Finance Section 319th Bombardment Group (Medium) The first American flying units at Attlebridge were squadrons of the 319th Bombardment Group (Medium) flying Martin B-26 Marauders which arrived at Attlebridge on 12 September 1942 from Harding Field, Louisiana. The airfield was then a satellite field for RAF Horsham St. Faith where the Group HQ and some personnel were stationed. These were the first squadrons flying this type of medium bomber to arrive in the UK from America. The Marauders moved out during November to St-Leu, Algeria as part of Twelfth Air Force, and Attlebridge was used by a training airfield with a few Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft. No. 320 (Dutch) Squadron RAF, moved in during March 1943 flying North American B-25 Mitchells departing in February 1944. 466th Bombardment Group (Heavy) Consolidated B-24J-20-FO Liberator Serial 44-48807 of the 784th Bomb Squadron Crew #562 Albert L.

The airfield was opened on 7 March 1944 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force 466th Bombardment Group (Heavy), arriving from Topeka Army Air Field, Kansas. The 466th was assigned to the 96th Combat Bombardment Wing, and the group tail code was a \\"Circle-L\\". Its operational squadrons were: * 784th Bombardment Squadron (T9) * 785th Bombardment Squadron (2U) * 786th Bombardment Squadron (U8) * 787th Bombardment Squadron (6L) The group flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator as part of the Eighth Air Force's strategic bombing campaign. The 466th began operations on 22 March 1944 by participating in a daylight raid on Berlin. The group operated primarily as a strategic bombardment organization, attacking such targets as marshalling yards at Liege, an airfield at St Trond, a repair and assembly plant at Reims, an airfield at Chartres, factories at Brunswick, oil refineries at Bohlen, aircraft plants at Kempten, mineral works at Hamburg, marshalling yards at Saarbr√ºcken, a synthetic oil plant at Misburg, a fuel depot at D√ºlmen, and aero engine works at Eisenach. Other operations included attacking pillboxes along the coast of Normandy on D-Day (6 June 1944), and afterwards striking interdictory targets behind the beachhead; bombing enemy positions at Saint-L√¥ during the Allied breakthrough in July 1944; hauling oil and gasoline to Allied forces advancing across France in September; hitting German communications and transportation during the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚àí January 1945; and bombing the airfield at Nordhorn in support of the airborne assault across the Rhine on 24 March 1945. The 466th flew last combat mission on 25 April 1945, striking a transformer station at Traunstein. The unit returned to Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota in July and was redesignated the 466th Bombardment Group (Very Heavy) in August 1945 and was equipped with Boeing B-29 Superfortresses. Current use After the war, RAF Attlebridge was placed in \\"care and maintenance\\" status for a few years, eventually being closed in 1950. It was sold during 1959-62 and was chosen as a site for extensive poultry rearing operations. Today, rows of turkey houses line the runways, isolated from each other because this is an important requirement in escaping the infectious diseases to which turkeys are prone. The runways, perimeter track, and a few of the hardstands remain as does the control tower, now extensively renovated and used as offices by the owners of the airfield site. The briefing room and HQ block still exist, the latter being used as a private house. The T-2 hangars have long since gone but a few of the old Nissen huts and other structures remain on some of the dispersed sites, used for a variety of purposes.

Associated with the various versions of the order were crosses and medals which could be awarded to lower-ranking soldiers and civilians. History The House Order of Hohenzollern was instituted on December 5, 1841, by joint decree of Prince Konstantin of and Prince Karl Anton of . These two principalities in southern Germany were Catholic collateral lines of the House of Hohenzollern, cousins to the Protestant ruling house of Prussia. On August 23, 1851, after the two principalities had been annexed by Prussia, the order was adopted by the Prussian branch of the house. Also, although the two principalities had become an administrative region of the Prussian kingdom, the princely lines continued to award the order as a house order. The Prussian version was then known as the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern (' or '), to distinguish it from the Princely House Order of Hohenzollern (' or '). Although Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated in 1918 as German Emperor and King of Prussia, he did not relinquish his role as Head of the Royal House and as such he was still able to confer the Royal House Order. The Princely House Order continued to be awarded, unofficially, after the fall of the German Monarchy. Another development occurred in 1935. Prince Karl Anton's second son, Karl Eitel Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, had become prince and then king of Romania as Carol I. Carol I had died childless and was succeeded by his nephew Ferdinand I, also of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. During the reign of Ferdinand's son King Carol II, the Romanian government established its own version of the House Order of Hohenzollern, known in Romanian as ' (\\"Order of 'Bene Merenti' of the Ruling House\\"). This form of the order existed until the Romanian monarchy was abolished in 1947; King Michael also awarded a slightly altered order in exile. Classes Royal House Order The Royal House Order of Hohenzollern came in the following classes: * Grand Commander (') * Commander (') * Knight (') * Member (') \\"Member\\" was a lesser class for soldiers who were not officers, as well as civilians. The Members' Cross ('), especially with swords, was a rare distinction for non-commissioned officers and the like. Another decoration, the Members' Eagle (') was often given as a long-service award to lesser officials such as schoolteachers. The \\"Eagles\\" (the Members' Eagle and the Knights' Eagle, or ') were solely civilian awards, and could not be awarded with swords. All other grades could be awarded with swords. During World War I, the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern became in effect an intermediate award between the Iron Cross 1st Class and the ' for Prussian junior officers. When awarded with swords it was worn on the ribbon of the Iron Cross. Princely House Order The Princely House Order of Hohenzollern came in the following classes: * Cross of Honour 1st Class (') * Commander's Cross of Honour (') * Cross of Honour 2nd Class (') * Cross of Honour 3rd Class (') * Golden Cross of Merit (') * Silver Cross of Merit (') * Golden Medal of Honour (') * Silver Medal of Merit (') The Crosses of Merit, Golden Medal of Honour and Silver Medal of Merit were lesser grades for non-commissioned officers, enlisted men and their civilian equivalents. All grades could be awarded with swords. During World War I, the appropriate grade of the Princely House Order was often awarded to officers and men of ', an infantry regiment raised in the principalities of Hohenzollern and whose honorary chief was the Prince of Hohenzollern. Soldier in the regiment's sister reserve and ' regiments also often received the decoration. Unlike the Royal House Order, awards of the Princely House Order were made on the standard ribbon of the order (the \\"statute\\" ribbon) regardless of whether they were with or without swords. Romanian House Order The classes of the Romanian version of the House Order were essentially the same as those of the Princely House Order, except that the Cross of Honour 3rd Class of the Romanian version could be awarded with Oak leaves, and the Golden and Silver Medals could be awarded with a Crown. As with the Prussian and Hohenzollern versions, crossed swords could be used to indicate a wartime or combat award. Given the short existence of the order and the fact that Romania had a number of other decorations for valor and military merit (Order of Michael the Brave, Order of the Star of Romania, Order of the Crown of Romania, Air Force Bravery Order, Cross of Military Virtue, Air Force and Naval Bravery Crosses, Crosses and Medals for Faithful Service, Medals for Steadfastness and Loyalty), awards of the Romanian version of the House Order with swords are uncommon. Insignia The badge of the House Order of Hohenzollern was a cross patt√©e with convex edges and curved arms (sometimes called an \\"Alisee\\" cross). There were differences in the enameling of the arms of the cross for the Royal, Princely and Romanian versions, but all featured white enamel on the higher classes and a black enameled stripe near the sides of the cross. Between the arms of the cross was a wreath of laurel leaves (left side) and oak leaves (right side). The cross bore a center medallion; the medallion and its band bore different coats of arms, mottos, dates and ciphers for each of the Royal, Princely and Romanian versions: * The white-enameled medallion of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern bore a black Prussian royal eagle with the Hohenzollern house coat of arms on a shield on the eagle's chest. Around the center medallion, a gold-rimmed band of blue enamel bore the motto in gold letters: ' (\\"From the cliffs to the sea\\"), with a wreath of laurel below. The white-enameled medallion on the reverse bore the cipher of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, the king when the order was founded. A gold-rimmed band of blue enamel bore the date ' with a wreath of laurel leaves (left side) and oak leaves (right side). * The white-enameled medallion of the Princely House Order of Hohenzollern bore the Hohenzollern coat of arms (a quartered shield of black and white) under a princely crown. Around the center medallion, a gold-rimmed band of blue enamel bore the motto in gold letters: ' (\\"For loyalty and merit\\") with a smaller wreath of oak leaves below. On most grades, the white-enameled medallion on the reverse bore the intertwined ciphers (\\"F\\" and \\"A\\") of Princes Friedrich (Konstantin's actual first name) and Anton, the princes who founded the order, under a princely crown. The gold-rimmed band of blue enamel bore one of several dates, depending on the class, such as ' for the 2nd and 3rd Classes, with a wreath of laurel leaves below. Romanian version for class of Commander (for military personnel) * The white-enameled medallion of the Romanian House Order bore a black Romanian eagle with the Hohenzollern coat of arms on a shield on the eagle's chest.

He also has a Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern on his medal bar. The following list is only a sample of some of the more prominent recipients' names. As noted above, the Knight's Cross with Swords of the Royal House Order was the intermediate decoration between the Iron Cross 1st Class and the Pour le M√©rite for Prussian junior officers. There were over 8,000 awards during World War I of this class (there were far fewer awards of the other classes, or of any class before the war).

As well as being co-hosts, McAllister and Ryan have also been a couple since 1986 and have been credited for introducing laminate flooring to British households.'How We Met: Justin Ryan & Colin McAllister', The Independent on Sunday, 12 December 2004. On 15 February 2008, they had a private civil partnership ceremony in London followed by a Caribbean honeymoon. Although their main residence is in Glasgow, they divide their time between there and London. They have filmed 4 13-episode series of Colin and Justin's Home Heist for HGTV, which is broadcast in approximately 25 countries. Television and radio programmes 2003‚Äì2005 *The Million Pound Property Experiment Million Pound Property Experiment was a BBC Television series which originally aired on BBC Two in the United Kingdom in 2003. In this, McAllister and Ryan renovated and re-sold properties for a profit as they gambled with a ¬£100,000 loan from the BBC, with the ultimate goal being a sale of a property for ¬£1million. Taking more than two years they bought, renovated and sold seven properties across the UK with the help of project manager Nigel Leck. Their final property sold for ¬£1.25 million and after paying back all loans they made a profit of nearly ¬£300,000 which was donated to BBC's Children in Need Appeal. *Twenty Ways to Make Money on Your Property McAllister and Ryan counted down the best ways to increase the values of viewers' homes. The format also included Twenty Builders' Botch Ups and Twenty Design Crimes. The series was made for the UK's Five channel. *Trading Up Trading Up (and overseas spin-off show Trading Up in the Sun) aired on BBC One in which McAllister and Ryan counselled people on how to successfully sell and buy property. The former concentrated on British homes while the latter saw the presenters travel around Spain and France in search of homes for British buyers. Seven series were filmed with 210 episodes in total. *Housecall This live format multi camera studio show, a production for BBC1, was hosted by Lowri Turner and co-presented by various experts such as chef James Martin and Colin and Justin. Spanning some seven series the decorators created live 'one hour' transformations interacting throughout with viewers. The emphasis was about creating 'style on a shoestring' and the show had a spin-off series called Housecall in the Country on which Colin and Justin also worked. *How Not to Decorate How Not to Decorate aired on the UK's Channel 5 and followed the format of the popular What Not to Wear series, but in this case McAllister and Ryan were recruited to transform homes with dramatically ugly interior decoration schemes into something more stylish. Four seasons of 13 were filmed as well as a mini series featuring celebrity homes. *Three Celebs and a Baby A British TV first, Colin and Justin, along with model Caprice, attempted to raise a ¬£150,000 anamatronic 'baby'. The show charted the three celebrities as they experienced the highs and lows of parenthood. Caprice infamously dropped her 'baby' while Colin and Justin later said in interviews that it made them realise they would indeed make good parents. 2006‚Äì2009 *The Farm In 2006, McAllister and Ryan hosted the reality series The Farm on Five. *Wedding Belles In McAllister and Ryan's next programme, Wedding Belles, which aired on Five in 2007, they became wedding decorators to prospective brides. Four one hour episodes now showing across the globe. *Hogmanay Stories McAllister and Ryan presented STV's 2008/2009 Hogmanay Stories, a mix of traditional Hogmanay celebrations, with music from Michelle McManus, John Carmichael and some surprise guests.

Smith, Cameron Stout, Aggie MacKenzie, Sanjeev Kohli, Limmy and others ‚Äì and messages to loved ones who find themselves away from home at that momentous time of the year. *Colin and Justin on the Estate ‚Äì 2008 McAllister and Ryan attempted to visually transform a council estate in Glasgow (Arden, on the south side of the city) in their 2007 show on Five. The premise was that everyone should be entitled to a good standard of living, no matter where they are on the social strata. An anniversary TV 'one year on' revisit is currently being planned. In September 2008, they organised and ran a charity auction at the Oran Mor arts centre in Glasgow, to raise money for the event. It was attended by national and local celebrities, including Anna Ryder Richardson and Atomic Kitten's Liz McClarnon. *Colin and Justin's Home Heist Colin and Justin's show Home Heist was filmed in Canada and is similar to How Not to Decorate, for North American audiences. Colin and Justin moved to Toronto in 2008 in preparation for the show, which premiered on the HGTV network in October 2009. The show has already been bought by multiple international broadcasters. The Canadian program's team also includes Cheryl Torrenueva, a designer and presenter associated with other TV shows such as Restaurant Impossible and Game of Homes on The W Network. *Colin and Justin's Home Show Colin and Justin visit different shopping centres/malls, create a set of a house in the middle of it, then proceed to decorate the set with items from the stores in the mall. The series was filmed before a live audience, and first shown in the UK on UKTV Style. *Colin and Justin's Music Makeover The Scots decorators hosted this drive time BBC Radio Scotland series which aired on Friday at 18:00 ‚Äì 19:00.

Geography The village lies at an altitude of 426 metres and covers an area of 9.658 km¬≤. It has a population of about 1700 people. ≈Ωehra Church The village was first mentioned in local records in 1245, when Count Johann of ≈Ωehra was given permission to construct a church there by the church authorities of Spi≈°. The Church of the Holy Spirit was completed in 1275. It is noted both for its picturesque appearance, perched on a mound above the village, and for its remarkable series of wall paintings. These have survived despite much damage to the building, including a fire in the 15th century which burnt down its original ceiling. The remaining building is a single nave structure, topped with onion-shaped domes of the 17th century. The oldest wall paintings are a set of eight consecration crosses, marking the spots where the original building was christened with holy chrism, and thus dating back to the 13th century. Later in the 13th century, a second stage of painting is marked by the depiction of Golgotha on the tympanum of the church's south doorway. Frescoes in the sanctuary, dating from the 14th century, showing Byzantine influence, include representations of the Last Judgement, the Last Supper, the Deposition and Saints Cosmas and Damian, the patron saints of doctors. On the north wall are two notable 'framed' frescoes, one depicting the Piet√†, the other showing a symbolic Tree of Life which dramatises the triumph of the Church over the Synagogue. Later frescoes date from the 15th century. These paintings were preserved because after an outbreak of plague in the 17th century, the interior of the church was covered with lime plaster for disinfection. They were discovered again in the 1950s when the lime was removed using cottage cheese - effective for this purpose because it contains casein. The church was declared a Czechoslovak National Monument in 1985, and in 1993 was listed as a World Heritage Site together with the nearby Spi≈° Castle, Spi≈°sk√° Kapitula, the National nature reserve of Dreven√≠k (a travertine formation), and (since 2009) the nearby town of Levoƒça.

The background to the novel comes from Jenkins' own wartime experience as a conscientious objector doing forestry work. Plot summary Two brothers, Calum (a simple-minded hunchback) and Neil, are working in the forest of a Scottish country house during five autumn days (Thursday to Monday) in 1943, gathering cones that will replenish the forest which is to be cut down for the war effort. The harmony of their life together is shadowed by the obsessive hatred of Duror, the gamekeeper, who since childhood has disliked anything he finds \\"mis-shapen\\". We also learn that because of his wife's illness where she lies in her bed all day growing larger, he relates to Calum in the sense of his deformity and thus conveys a reason why he grew so much resentment towards him. Lady Runcie-Campbell, the aristocratic landowner, dislikes having the two brothers on the estate, and tries to avoid communicating with them. She is embarrassed by her son, Roderick, who is friendly and welcoming to the brothers. The obsession Duror has for the brothers grows stronger, leading to the climax, when Lady Runcie- Campbell discovers Calum hanging dead from a tree, having been shot by Duror, who subsequently shoots himself. Major themes The novel covers several themes, perhaps the most obvious being sacrifice; Neil's sacrifice for his brother, the sacrifice of the forest being cut down, and the ultimate sacrifice of Calum himself. There is close examination of good and evil, intertwined with Neil's jealousy and hatred for Lady Runcie-Campbell and her family, and in turn Lady Runcie-Campbell's jealousy and hatred for the two brothers working on the estate. Her turmoil between trying to appear to be Christian, and upholding her aristocratic background, recurs throughout the novel, which introduces the theme of religion. Another theme is class structure - Lady Runcie-Campbell believes she is above the lower subjects, Duror himself enjoys the small luxuries he is given because of his higher job of game keeper, but Neil hates the class structure: \\"we're human beings just like them\\". This carries on throughout the book, and at the end we can see that Lady Runcie Campbell might even have been able to stop the death of Calum. Yet another theme is nature. Calum himself is extremely close to nature - he does not feel close to the human world, but in nature he seems to coexist with it: \\"it was a good tree [...] with rests among its topmost branches as comfortable as chairs.\\" The situation between these characters within the grounds of the estate is a microcosm for the world at large, where dominating factions (Duror, Nazi regime) have decided to despise and want to get rid of those whom they deem inferior (Calum, Jews and other persecuted peoples in WW2). Duror also feels a similar sense of hatred and disgust for his ill wife, who has grown morbidly obese and does not fit his ideals. His disgust for both Calum and his wife contribute to his growing anger and resentment. Symbolism The novel is filled with heavy symbolism, including some of the following: *The woods, representing the Garden of Eden. While the outside world is filled with the death and destruction of the ongoing war, the woods are filled with life and colour. *Calum, embodying innocence and purity. *Duror, embodying darkness, and a parallel for the serpent in the Garden of Eden *Roderick, demonstrating social equality *Lady Runcie-Campbell & Neil, both epitomising their polarised views of the social class division * The cones - symbolising renewal, regeneration *Calum symbolising the crucifixion of Jesus - sacrificed himself to erase all human sins. Links to Calum's sacrifice as the break in divide of social class and war Significance The Cone Gatherers is inevitably compared to John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men due to the similarities in theme, plot and characters, although the novel grew directly out of Jenkins' personal experiences in the Second World War.

Cyclops was a high-power laser built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1975. It was the second laser constructed in the lab's Laser program, which aimed to study inertial confinement fusion (ICF). The Cyclops was a single-beam Neodymium glass (Nd:glass) laser. The Janus laser, a two-beam version of it, was also completed in 1975. The main scientific aims of its construction were for the study of nonlinear focusing effects in high power laser beams, novel amplification techniques (disks of Nd:glass at the brewster angle), spatial filtering techniques which would be used on subsequent higher powered lasers such as the Argus and Shiva lasers and for inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research. Background Even the earliest ICF laser experiments demonstrated that one of the main problems which needed to be addressed was poor focusing of the beams and damage caused to optics due to the beam's extreme intensities caused by the optical Kerr effect, where, because the beam is so intense, that during its passage through either air or glass the electric field of the light actually alters the index of refraction of the material and causes the beam at the most intense points to \\"self focus\\" down to filament like structures of extremely high intensity. When a beam collapses into extremely high intensity filaments like this, it can easily exceed the laser damage threshold of laser glass and other optics, severely damaging them by creating pits, cracks and grey tracks through the glass. This novel problem only became obvious as the lasers were scaled up in power to where nonlinear phenomena occur with very intense beams of light. LLNL's Krupke stated: > If the intensity of the light gets high enough --as in fusion lasers-- the > electric field in the light perturbs the atoms of the glass so strongly that > the glass responds in a nonlinear way. At the time there was no strong theoretical understanding of these effects, and predicting them was difficult. However, LLNL researchers combined their own efforts with those of the commercial glass vendors and were able to develop a new predictive tool which explained the relationship between the nonlinear effect intensity to all types of glass. As Krupke noted: > It was like the Rosetta stone. With this quantitative correspondence, they > were able to plot the nonlinear refractive performance of millions of > glasses and find the one with the lowest possible value. We then worked with > our industrial partners to make a composition with the characteristics we > needed. Although using the proper glass was able to reduce the problem as much as possible, the problem still existed. For smaller experiments this would not be enough of an effect to worry about, but with the much larger and more powerful Shiva already under design, some way of further improving the beam smoothness of the laser needed to be studied. The simplest way to eliminate these effects was to filter them out physically using what essentially amounts to a Fourier transform technique applied to the beam's spatial intensity profile. Imaging spatial filters are, in effect, small inverted telescopes inserted in the laser beam to focus the light through a pinhole. Many modes of spatial anisotropy would result in a very low angle of diffraction off the centerline however, so to improve the smoothing performance, the spatial filter tube is extremely long, thereby maximizing the distance the filaments moved from the centerline. Such a laser had not previously been built, the earlier Janus laser, which explored the Nd:glass laser itself, was only a few meters long. It was precisely the problems of building a long laser that Cyclops was built to study. Cyclops was effectively a single-beam of the larger Shiva design, one that could be completed as quickly as possible in order to identify potential problems and come up with the best arrangement for the filters. In this goal Cyclops was successful, and every major ICF effort since has used the spatial filtering technique, leading to ever-growing laser \\"beamlines\\" on the order of 100 m today. While Cyclops was still under construction, another LLNL laser was being built that also incorporated the spatial filtering technique, Argus. Argus passed its light through a series of amplifiers, with spatial filters between each stage and easily achieved terawatt beam powers.

The receiver measures the time difference of arrival of the signal from the transmitter directly, and via reflection from the target. This defines an ellipse of constant bistatic range, called an iso-range contour, on which the target lies, with foci centred on the transmitter and receiver. If the target is at range Rrx from the receiver and range Rtx from the transmitter, and the receiver and transmitter are a distance L apart, then the bistatic range is Rrx+Rtx-L. Motion of the target causes a rate of change of bistatic range, which results in bistatic Doppler shift.Cherniakov, Mikhail (ed). (2007). Bistatic Radar: Principles and Practice. Wiley.

Currently ten research chairs are grouped under four major departments: * Aerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and Propulsion (AWEP) * Control and Operations (C&O;) * Aerospace Structures and Materials (ASM) * Space Engineering (SpE) Facilities Live video connection between astronaut Andr√© Kuipers and the students, in the presence of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Belgian astronaut Frank De Winne. Extensive laboratory and testing facilities are used in research and teaching. The facilities include supersonic, hypersonic and subsonic wind-tunnels, a high-sensitivity navigation simulator, a structures and materials testing laboratory, and an ISO 8, class 100,000 clean room for the development of micro satellites. These facilities make it possible to conduct experiments in man-machine factors, flight control, structures and materials, aerodynamics, simulation, motion, navigation and spaceflight. The faculty owns and makes use of a Cessna Citation jet aeroplane which is a unique flying laboratory. The Citation is used in research as well as in education. Its modular interior enables the possibility to change quickly between research missions and educational flights with students.  Delft Aerospace Structures and Materials laboratory  The Delft Aerospace Structures and Materials laboratory is one of the largest facilities of the faculty of aerospace engineering with a footprint of over 3600 square meters. The laboratory is split up in multiple smaller laboratories which allow for a wide variety of research and educational activities. Amongst others the facility consists of labs for the production, handling and testing of composites, facilities suitable for performing mechanical tests, a chemical lab, a micro UAV testing and development facility and work spaces for students to manufacture and test parts that they designed during their studies. The Delft Aerospace Structures and Materials laboratory is also the home of a large collection of aircraft and spacecraft (parts), including a retired F16 of the Dutch air force, which are used for educational purposes. Furthermore the laboratory also houses the Aircraft Manufacturing Laboratory, which is a laboratory where graduate students of the faculty are building a fully functional RV12 aircraft.  Simona  The flight simulator Simona is one of the most impressive facilities at the faculty. It can be programmed to simulate any known aircraft, but also to mimic characteristics of a new design. The unique light design allows extremely realistic motion. The simulator is used for research, but is also the subject of some M.Sc. thesis projects.  Clean room  The eight floor of the faculty houses an ISO 8, class 100,000 cleanroom for the development of micro satellites. The facility is used both by staff and by graduate students from the space department of the faculty. The cleanroom is used for space related research and for the production of TU Delft's micro satellites, of which two are currently in orbit around the Earth: Delfi-C3, and Delfi-n3Xt. Contact with these satellites is maintained through a ground station housed on campus at the faculty of electrical engineering, computer science and mathematics. National and international cooperation The Faculty plays a significant role in national organisations such as the National Aerospace Laboratory, the Netherlands Agency for Aerospace Programmes and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research. Collaborations with numerous international and multinational industries through research groups abroad as well as in the Netherlands ensure that the Faculty remains at the forefront of the latest developments in the aerospace industry. The Faculty is a member of PEGASUS, the European network of prestigious aerospace universities.

Programs have been initiated on several occasions with the aim of creating an indestructible vehicle for penetrating enemy formations without fear of being destroyed in combat; however, only a few examples have ever been built, and there is little evidence of any super heavy tank having seen combat. Examples were designed in World War I and World War II, along with a few in the Cold War.  History   World War I  Model of the Flying Elephant design The first super-heavy tank was designed by the Russian naval engineer Vasily Mendeleyev who worked on the project from 1911 to 1915. The tank was envisioned to be invulnerable to almost all contemporary threats but remained on paper because of its high construction cost. Following the production of their first tanks, the British \\"Flying Elephant\\" was designed as a tank that would be resistant to artillery fire. Since mobility was more important than protection, and the tanks already developed were successful, work on the project was stopped. The German K-Wagen (Gro√ükampfwagen) was a very heavy design carrying 4 guns and needing a crew of 27. Two of them were under construction when the war ended and both were demolished. In the early 1920s, the French produced the 70-tonne Char 2C. The ten tanks would see limited combat during the Battle for France in 1940.  World War II  During World War II all of the major combatants introduced prototypes for special roles. Adolf Hitler was a proponent of \\"war winning\\" weapons and supported projects like the 188 tonne Maus, and even larger 1,000 tonne Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte. The British and Soviets all built prototype designs similar to the Jagdtiger, and the US was working on the project then known as T95 Gun Carriage, which was later changed to T28 Super Heavy Tank. However, most of these designs never passed the prototype stage, and only some have ever been in existence.  Cold War  The idea of very heavy tanks saw less development after the war, not least since tactical nuclear weapons would always be more powerful than any feasible armour could protect against. The advances in armour technology allowed large tanks to stay in the approximate up to 65 ton range. Examples include Object 279 (Soviet Union) and T30 Heavy Tank (United States).  Post Cold war  Further advances in armour technology have given the armour of late 20th century tanks the estimated equivalent of over a meter of rolled homogeneous armour (the type of armour used before, now used for comparison between different armour designs). At the same time the weapon development allows for any equal adversary to destroy any target detected and tracked by the wide array of different sensors available. This means adding more armour would not increase protection to any significant degree, and thus current development is instead focused on a combination of remaining undetected, interfering with tracking and active counter-measures to neutralize the enemy weapon systems.  List of models  ; United Kingdom: * TOG1: 80 tons; built in 1940; designed for ground conditions similar to those experienced in WWI; one prototype. * TOG2: 80 tons improved design of TOG1; one prototype. * Flying Elephant: First World War-era project at 100 tons; not built. * Tortoise heavy assault tank: 80 tons, designed to attack fortifications. 6 pilot vehicles completed. * Neither of the TOG prototypes were built the way they were designed; had the sponsons been added, and the proper turret attached, their weight would be different. ; France: * Char 2C: 69 tons; World War I era technology; 10 built, in service from 1921 to 1940; obsolete by World War II, 9 destroyed to prevent capture and the remaining 1 was shown in Berlin as a trophy. ** Char 2C bis: 72 tons; modified Char 2C with 155 mm howitzer and different turret; one Char 2C was converted into this variant but later returned into the original configuration * FCM F1: 139 tons; World War II era replacement for the Char 2C, to attack fortifications. Ordered and full-scale wooden mock-up was produced but no prototype built before the Fall of France (1940). * ARL Tracteur C: 145 tons, developed by ARL to attack fortifications; wooden mockup was produced but canceled in favor of FCM F1 which was proven to be superior design (developed 1939-1940) * AMX Tracteur C: 140 tons, developed by AMX to attack fortifications; the project was terminated after AMX being horribly out of schedule (developed 1939-1940) ; German Empire: * K-Wagen: 120 metric tons; two were nearly complete when World War I ended. Both were demolished. ; Nazi Germany: * Jagdtiger: 71.7 tons. Around eighty built. * Panzer VII L√∂we: About 95‚Äì100 tons; canceled in favour of Maus. * Panzer VIII Maus: 188 tons, two prototypes. Both were captured by the Soviet army, although one had been partially destroyed. A composite of the two can now be seen at the Kubinka Tank Museum. * Panzerkampfwagen E-100: 140 tons; one incomplete hull at factory captured by British and later scrapped. * Panzer IX: Concept by Signal. * Panzer X: Another concept by Signal. * Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte: 1,000 tons; canceled, no evidence construction began. * Panzerkampfwagen E 75 Standardpanzer: 92 tons; only a design concept. ; Japanese Empire: * O-I series ** \\"Super Heavy Tank\\": 120 tons. Purportedly one prototype was produced in 1943.Taki‚Äôs Imperial Japanese Army page: Super-Heavy Tank \\"O-I\\" According to another source, the O-I project was canceled before the 120-ton prototype was completed. ** \\"Ultra Heavy Tank\\": Modification of the O-I Super Heavy Tank with four turrets. Project only. ; Russian Empire: * Tsar Tank: A giant- wheeled gun platform of 1914 which was abandoned because it was vulnerable to artillery. * Mendeleev Tank: A massive super-heavy tank designed in 1911-1915, it weighed approximately 173.2 tons. ; Soviet Union: * T-42 (Tank Grote or TG-V): 100 tons with 107 mm main gun and four sub-turrets. Models and drawings produced Zaloga 1984:85 * KV-4: 1941 project. A proposed 90‚Äì100 ton tank, carrying a 107 mm main gun and a 45 mm or 76 mm secondary; various layouts were considered, with the hull-mounted 107 mm and a 76 mm turret chosen as the final option.KV-4 data sheet and pictures of the proposed designs Feasibility stage only. * KV-5: another Kliment Voroshilov series 100-ton-class tank design. Armed with the same 107 mm main gun in a large, KV-2-style turret, and two 12.7 mm machine gun turrets (one on the forward hull, one on top of the main turret); powered by two V2 diesels due to wartime lack of a 1200 hp engine. Project stopped due to Siege of Leningrad and cancelled without anything built. ; United States: * T28 Super Heavy Tank: Also known as T95 GMC, designed for attacking heavy fortifications. 86.2 metric tons; 2 prototypes built right after World War II; by layout a self- propelled gun. Very similar to British Tortoise. One can now be seen on display at Fort Benning, Georgia.  See also  * Bolo (tank)  References   Bibliography   Zaloga, Steven J., James Grandsen (1984).

It results from disease of one lung, one major bronchus, or chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with trepopnea in most lung diseases prefer to lie on the opposite side of the diseased lung, as the gravitation increases perfusion of the lower lung. Increased perfusion in diseased lung would increase shunting and hypoxemia, resulting in worsening shortness of breath. To maximize function of the healthier lung, the patient is best to lie on the side of the healthier lung, so that it receives adequate perfusion. Patients with chronic heart failure prefer to lie mostly on the right side, to enable a better blood return, whereby cardiac output is augmented.

The grassy hills of C√©sar Ch√°vez Park. C√©sar Ch√°vez Park is a city park of Berkeley, California named after C√©sar Ch√°vez.Berkeley Department of Parks, Recreation & Waterfront It can be found on the peninsula on the north side of the Berkeley Marina in the San Francisco Bay and is adjacent to Eastshore State Park. The park's east position in San Francisco Bay provides panoramic views of San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Marin Headlands, and the east bay hills. The park's terrain is characterized by very open grassy hills that have become popular for kite flying. Paved paths run the perimeter and throughout the park where picnic tables and barbecue grills are available to the public. Features * Grassy areas for kite flying, \\"Frisbee\\" playing, etc. (no officially designated sports fields). * Hiking on trails throughout the park; the Dorothy Stegmann trail around the park's perimeter is fully wheelchair accessible. * Off-leash dog area (17 acre). * Picnic tables with BBQ grills (several arranged for large groups). * Solar Calendar. * Wildlife sanctuary. * The park's traditional public washroom was closed in 2015, but, in 2019, City Council considered replacing it with a more robust Portland Loo. History The park began as a landfill dating back to 1957, when dikes were constructed for the purpose of containing municipal waste. In 1969, the city adopted the Marina Master Plan, which set aside the landfill area for unstructured recreation. In 1991 the city completely sealed the landfill and the park opened soon thereafter, originally as North Waterfront Park. In 1996, the city renamed the park after C√©sar E. Ch√°vez, union leader and founder of the United Farm Workers of America. Activities Popular activities include model rocket launching, kite flying, drone and model airplane flying, picnicking, dog walking, jogging and walking. Although on a peninsula, the park has no access to the water because there are no beaches nor steps down through the park's reinforced shoreline. Events Revellers watching the Summer Solstice sunset * Solstice and Equinox celebrations at the Solar Calendar: Celebrations are held quarterly on the solstices and equinoxes. These celebrations include both scientific and cultural components. From the web site: \\"Many cultural celebrations are rooted in the cycles of the sun and moon, especially the solstices and equinoxes. For example, Easter, Passover, Narooz in the Spring, Rosh Hashanah, Kwaanza, Christmas in the winter, etc.\\" * Fourth of July Celebration and Fireworks: While most of this event is held elsewhere in the Marina, many people gather on the small hills at Cesar Chavez Park to watch the fireworks. * Berkeley Kite Festival: Annual event held the last weekend in July.

The Irob people (Ge'ez: ·ä¢·àÆ·â•  æir≈çb, also spelled Erob) are an ethnic group who occupy a predominantly highland, mountainous area by the same name in northeastern Tigray Region, Ethiopia. They speak the Saho language. Most of them profess the catholic Christian religion and are mostly farmers.https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/14641/ET The etymology of the name Irob is debatable, but Irob's elders say that the term comes from the word Saho \\"Oroba\\", which means \\"welcome to our home\\". The boundaries of Irobland are, to an extent, identical to the Irob woreda; both are bordered by the following areas: Dabri-Mela to the north, Hado to the east, the Afar Region to the east and south, Shoumezana and Gulomakeda to the west, and Saesi Tsaedaemba to the south. The first two neighbors are Saho speakers and predominantly Muslim, the third are Muslim Afars, and the others are Tigrigna- speaking Christians. History Irob boys in Alitena. The capital (traditional center) of Irob is Alitena. Irobs trace their lineage to one man, Summe, son of Neguse Worede-Mehret, who according to the Irob oral history, migrated to the Irobland from Tsira'e in Kilite Awla'elo, a part of Tigray, about 700 years ago. Despite their relatively small population, the Irob have been at the forefront of regional and national politics in Ethiopia. Starting with the Zemene Mesafint, the Irob family of Shum Agame Woldu dominated Tigrayan politics. The dynasty included Dejazmach Subagadis (whose rule extended to present-day Eritrea), Shum Agame Desta, Ras Sebhat Aregawi, and many others including Emperor Yohannes IV. During the Italian invasion, Irob patriots, led by individuals such as Dejazmach Ayele Sebhat and Dejazmach Kassa Sebhat,Anthony Mockler recounts how they attacked, and almost destroyed, an Italian column that had advanced from southern Eritrea, across the Danakil Depression, to reach the edge of the Ethiopian highlands. (Haile Selassie's War [New York: Olive Branch Press, 2003], pp. 66f) contributed to the anti- Italian resistance movement from their base on Mount Asimba. In more recent times, many Irobs, such as Dr. Tesfay Debessay, who was a leader of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (EPRP), played an important role in the struggle waged against the dictatorial junta led by Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam. Mount Assimba from a distance.Aiga Village. Moreover, the Irobland proper, particularly around the Assimba and Aiga localities, served as a base for several Ethiopian revolutionary movements, including EPRP and the Tigray People's Liberation Front(TPLF). Aiga is also the location of significant battles during the Ethio-Eritrean border war (1998‚Äì2000), which ultimately lead to the removal of occupying Eritrean forces from the region. Lifestyle and Culture The Irob are divided into three major subgroup,s or Are (Houses): Adgadi-Are, Buknaiti-Are and Hasaballa. The Adgadi-Are and Hasaballa are predominantly Orthodox Christians, while Bouknaiti-Are consist of Catholics. The Irob economy is primarily based on agriculture, including animal husbandry. The region is also renowned for its excellent honey. In fact, the Miess /Tej or local \\"Beer\\"(honey-wine) made from the honey is praised throughout the region for its quality. In general, the Irob are a bicultural community. With their Saho-speaking neighbors, they share a common language and certain social structures, such as a clan division system called Mela, and the title Ona for their regional leaders. Many other cultural practices, including wedding ceremonies, dress, dance, and food; however, are more similar to their Tigrigna-speaking neighbors specially with the peoples of Agame. Irobs also have distinctive customs. For example, they have an elaborate poetry-telling tradition called Adar. The Irob men have a dance/step routine called Hora and Alkafo, which was traditionally performed in preparation for battles and still commonly displayed during weddings and other ceremonies.

It began in 1874 following the Custer Expedition and reached a peak in 1876-77. Rumors and poorly documented reports of gold in the Black Hills go back to the early 19th century. In the 1860s, Roman Catholic missionary Father De Smet is reported to have seen Sioux Indians carrying gold which they told him came from the Black Hills.Watson Parker (1966) Gold in the: University of Nebraska Press, p.12-13. Prior to the Gold Rush, the Black Hills were used by Native Americans (primarily bands of Sioux but others also ranged through the area). The United States government recognized the Black Hills as belonging to the Sioux by the Treaty of Laramie in 1868. Despite being within Indian territory, and therefore off-limits, white Americans were increasingly interested in the gold-mining possibilities of the Black Hills. Prospectors found gold in 1874 near present-day Custer, South Dakota, but the deposit turned out to be small. The large placer gold deposits of Deadwood Gulch were discovered in November 1875, and in 1876, thousands of gold-seekers flocked to the new town of Deadwood, although it was still within Indian land.A.L. Slaughter. \\"The Homestake mine\\", in Ore Deposits of the United States 1933-1967 (New York: American Institute of Mining Engineers, 1968), p.1437. The tale of first gold discovery in the Black Hills was thrown into question in 1887 by the discovery of what has become known as the Thoen Stone. Discovered by Louis Thoen on the slopes of Lookout Mountain, the stone purports to be the last testament of Ezra Kind who, along with six others, entered the Black Hills in 1833 (at a time when whites were forbidden by law and treaty from entering the area), \\"got all the gold we could carry\\" in June 1834, and were subsequently \\"killed by Indians beyond the high hill\\". While it may seem unlikely that someone who has \\"lost my gun and nothing to eat and Indians hunting me\\" would take the time to carve his story in sandstone, there is corroborating historical evidence for the Ezra Kind party.Thomson, Frank. The Thoen Stone 1966. Many of the miners came up the Missouri River from Kansas and eventually returned there. History Homestake Mine in 1889 The Black Hills Gold Rush began in 1874. The first arrivals were a force of 1,000 men led by George Armstrong Custer to investigate reports that the area contained gold, even though the land was owned by the Sioux. They found small amounts of gold in present-day Custer, South Dakota, and looked for better- paying locations. They moved north, establishing the towns of Hill City, Sheridan, and Pactola. At each spot, they found flakes of gold, but not the bonanza they sought. Things changed when the miners stumbled across Deadwood and Whitewood Creeks in the northern Black Hills. For the initial discoverers, each spade of earth revealed a veritable fortune in gold. By 1876, miners had claimed all the land around the creeks. Although all the land was claimed, thousands more flocked in, hoping to find a missed spot. The gold the miners had found was placer gold, loose gold pieces that were mixed in with the rocks and soil around streams. Most good prospectors knew that this placer gold was eroded from hard-rock deposits. So while many still flocked to Deadwood, others looked for the hard-rock deposits that were the source of the placer gold. On April 9, 1876 Fred and Moses Manuel, Hank Harney and Alex Engh discovered a gold outcropping near Lead, South Dakota; they claimed their find and named it the Homestake. They had located the area from which the placer gold in Deadwood Creek had eroded. Here, the men produced 10% of the world's gold supply over the next 125 years. Many more prospectors hoped to find another \\"Homestake\\" so they continued to look, but the Homestake mine was unique. The workers crushed the rock to release the gold, concentrated the gold by gravity methods, and then exposed the concentrate to mercury that would amalgamate or mix with the gold. Miners call this kind of gold extraction free milling. Gold existed elsewhere in the Black Hills, but it was not in a state suitable for free-milling. In these conditions, gold was chemically bound to the rock, and very difficult to remove. It was called refractory gold ore. For many years, the Homestake operated as the only major gold mine in the Black Hills. Chlorization and smelting were seen as two methods that could remove gold from the refractory ore in the 1890s. More rock mining regions opened up around Lead and Deadwood because of this discovery. During the gold rush, \\"Treasure Coaches\\" transporting large quantities of the precious metal worth up to $300,000 on each haul to Cheyenne, Wyoming, became a favorite target for road agents. The last recorded hold-up occurred around 3:00 pm on September 26, 1878, at the Canyon Springs station, about 35 miles south of Deadwood. The robbers bound and gagged the stableman and lined the stable wall with their guns through cracks between the logs. As the coach approached the station, the desperadoes opened fire. One guard was killed, and two guards were wounded. The chief guard took cover behind a large pine tree, exchanged a few shots with the bandits, and got them to agree to let him go if he would leave the coach with them. After he left, the outlaws tied the driver to one of the coach's wheels, opened the safe with a sledge hammer and chisels, divided the loot, and rode off in different directions. Aroused citizens in the area organized manhunts, and the stage company offered a $2,500 reward. Several suspects were lynched, others were convicted at trial on various counts, and more than half of the gold was eventually recovered.

It is conventionally divided into Purvabhaga (earlier part) written by Banabhatta, and Uttarabhaga (latter part) by Bhushanabhatta. (An alternate tradition gives the son's name as Pulindabhatta.) The standard editions of the original Sanskrit text are by Peterson and Kane. There are translations into English by Kale, Layne and Ridding; and an abridgement into Gujarati by Bhalan (edited by Keshavlal Dhruv). This novel has an extremely intricate plot which is difficult to summarize concisely. Its central thread is that of a romantic attachment (and eventual union) between the hero Chandrapeeda and the heroine Kadambari. However, there are several competing subplots; indeed, the heroine does not make her appearance until past the midpoint. Many of the characters appear in multiple incarnations, some as humans and some as demigods or animals. The narration proceeds in a succession of nested frames; a large part of it is a retelling by a parrot of a story which was told to it by a sage. The latter story also contains several instances of one character relating a sub-story to another character. The plot has probably been adapted from the story of King Sumanas from Gunadhya's Brihatkatha (a conjectural collection of stories in the extinct Paishachi language). This story also appears in Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara (which is believed to be a Sanskrit precis of Gunadhya's work). This work can be plausibly claimed to be one of the first novels in the world; making due allowance for the ambiguities of such a classification. In fact, two modern Indian languages (Kannada and Marathi) use 'kadambari' as a generic term for a romance or a novel. Apart from the Kadambari, Banabhatta is also the author of Harshacharita, a biography of his patron king Harshavardhana. It is this circumstance which allows one to date the author with a reasonable degree of certainty.  Plot synopsis  (The paragraphs have been numbered for ease of reference. The original text is continuous, and has no chapter divisions. The Purvabhaga (first part) ends abruptly inside Paragraph 16, at a point when Kadambari is speaking about her love-sickness to Patralekha, as narrated by the latter to Chandrapeeda.) # There is a valiant king named Shudraka, who rules over a vast and prosperous kingdom with the capital city of Vidisha. One day, a Chandala (a low caste of forest-dwellers) maiden comes to his court and makes a present of a parrot (named Vaishampayana) to the king. After having eaten some tasty morsels and rested in the royal chambers, the parrot begins to narrate his tale with the preamble, \\"Your Majesty, this is a very long story; but if you are curious, it will be told.\\" # The parrot says that he used to live in the Vindhya forest with his aging father. One day, the forest is overrun by Shabaras (a band of hunters) who kill an enormous number of animals and cause great destruction. Vaishampayana's father is dragged from his hollow and murdered. After the commotion has died out, Vaishampayana wanders off, and eventually finds refuge in a hermitage where he meets the divine sage Jabali. The latter stares at the parrot for a while and remarks that \\"He is experiencing the fruit of his own misbehaviour.\\" The other hermits become curious at this remark, and Jabali begins to narrate the tale which fills a large part of the 'Kadambari'. # Jabali says that in the country of Avanti, there was a city called Ujjayini which was ruled by King Tarapeeda. He had wealth, vitality, spiritual knowledge, and a large harem, but no son. One night, the king dreams that Chandra (the Moon God) had entered the mouth of his queen Vilasavati. He relates this dream to his chief minister Shukanasa, who in turn confides that in his dream, a figure clad in white placed a Pundarika (lotus) into the lap of his wife Manorama. # Within a few days, both wives are found to be pregnant, and each of them gives birth to a boy. Tarapeeda's son is named Chandrapeeda, and Shukanasa's son is named Vaishampayana. The two boys, who become bosom friends, are raised together in a heavily fortified university built especially for them. Chandrapeeda acquires a powerful and swift horse called Indrayudha, which becomes his inseparable companion. # Having completed their education, the two friends reenter the capital city. There are boisterous celebrations at their return, and Chandrapeeda is ogled at by throngs of besotted young women. Queen Vilasavati makes a present of a beautiful prepubescent girl named Patralekha to her son. Tarapeeda decides to install his son as the heir-apparent. Shukanasha gives him some worldly advice, after which, Chandrapeeda and Vaishampayana, accompanied by a vast army, set forth to conquer the world. # Chandrapeeda subdues all the princes in the world, and decides to settle for a temporary rest at Suvarnapura in the Himalayas. One day, while riding his horse, he sees a couple of Kinnaras (a race of demigods), and gives chase. They elude him however, and the prince gets lost. He finds himself at the bank of the beautiful lake Acchoda. Having quenched his thirst, he hears a sweet melody and begins to look for its source. It is found to originate from the Veena (lute) of a heavenly and lustrous damsel dressed as an ascetic, sitting in a temple of Lord Shiva. # The damsel, named Mahashveta, offers hospitality to Chandrapeeda. He insists that she should narrate her story. Mahashveta begins the narration in a gush of tears with the words, \\" O Prince, what is to be gained by hearing my story of my renunciation of the world? But if you are eager to know, I shall tell it.\\" # Mahashveta relates that she is the daughter of a Gandharva (a demigod). One day, she had come to Lake Acchoda for a bath, when she spotted a handsome young ascetic and was instantly smitten. An enticing smell seemed to emanate from his body. The ascetic, too, appeared to be overwhelmed by passion. She approaches a second young sage (named Kapinjala), who tells her that her object of infatuation is named Pundarika. He is the son of Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth) who had conceived him while sitting on a lotus, by merely looking at the great sage Shvetaketu. One day, as Kapinjala and Pundarika were wandering in the Nandana forest, the goddess of the forest presented a fresh mango sprout to Pundarika as an ornament for his ear. It is this sprout which is the source of this smell. # Pundarika removes the sprout from Pundarika's ear, and places it onto Mahashveta's ear. His rosary falls down, as he is trembling from the pleasure of touching her cheek. Mahashveta wears it around her neck. Kapinjala gives a scolding to Pundarika for succumbing to such a base passion, contrary to his calling as an ascetic. Pundarika feels abashed, and asks for his rosary back in mock-anger. Since Pundarika is visibly befuddled due to his passion, Mahashveta deceives him by giving him her strand of pearls instead of the rosary. # They part company, and that night Mahashveta is driven senseless by her love-sickness. Her beetle-box bearer Taralika mentions to her that she was approached by Pundarika, who enquired about her mistress. He has given a love-letter for Mahashveta written on the bark of a tree using the juice of a leaf as ink. Mahashveta loses her mind after reading it, when the arrival of Kapinjala is announced. The latter reports that Pundarika is driven to the brink of his existence by his passion for Mahashveta, and henceforth his life is in her hands. # After Kapinjala has departed, Mahashveta is tormented and falls into a swoon. As the moon rises, she leaves her palace to meet Pundarika. However, she hears Kapinjala's wailing from a distance, who tells her that Pundarika is dead. Mahashveta is heart-broken, and prepares to immolate herself on the funeral pyre. At this moment, a divine being descends from the skies and carries aloft Pundarika's body. He admonishes Mahashveta not to give up her life, and reassures her that \\"You two will be reunited.\\" Kapinjala is agitated, and flies away himself in pursuit of this being. Mahashveta believes herself to be responsible for Pundarika's death. She has given up all worldly pleasures, and is now an ascetic. This ends Mahashveta's narrative, begun in Paragraph 7. # Chandrapeeda consoles Mahashveta and advises her not to blame herself. He enquires after her companion Taralika. Mahashveta explains: The Gandharva king Chitraratha and his queen Madira have a daughter named Kadambari, who has been a childhood companion to me. She is filled with despair due to my plight, and has vowed not to marry as long as I am in grief. Kadambari's parents are vexed by this decision of hers, and have asked me to persuade her. Thus, immediately before your arrival here, I have sent Taralika to deliver my message to Kadambari. # The very next day, Taralika returns along with a young Gandharva named Keyuraka. The latter says that Kadambari was very upset by the message and is firmly decided against marrying while Mahashveta's bereavement continues. Mahashveta decides to visit Kadambari herself, accompanied by Chandrapeeda. They visit Mount Hemaketu (the Gandharvas' dwelling). Immediately after Chandrapeeda and Kadambari have seen each other, the two are utterly in love. # Mahashveta importunes Kadambari that she should let Chandrapeeda return to his place, since his companions must be anxious about him. Chandrapeeda returns, and is reunited with Vaishampayana, Patralekha and his army. The next day, he is trailed by Keyuraka who brings the message that Kadambari is suffering from pangs of separation. # Chandrapeeda, immediately mounts his horse Indrayudha, and accompanied by Patralekha, speeds away towards Kadambari. Kadambari is growing pale from desire. Chandrapeeda coyly offers to cure her by suggesting that his body is at her service, but Kadambari demurs. As Chandrapeeda is about to leave, Kadambari requests that Patralekha be left behind as her companion. This is agreed to, and Chandrapeeda returns to his camp. # He receives a letter from his father Tarapeeda complaining of his prolonged absence and requesting his immediate return to the kingdom. Chandrapeeda sends a messenger to Kadambari, leaves Vaishampayana in charge of the slowly returning army and marches rapidly onwards towards the capital. In a few days he reaches Ujjayini. Along the way he comes across a Chandika temple and witnesses the antics of a very eccentric shrivelled Dravida ascetic. (This part seems to have been composed merely for amusement, and has no connection with the later narrative.) Chandrapeeda's parents and the citizens are delighted to see him. In a few days, Patralekha brings news that Kadambari is suffering exceedingly from love-sickness. # Keyuraka arrives shortly thereafter, confirming this description of Kadambari. Chandrapeeda's own state of mind is quite the same. He decides to solicit the help of his friend Vaishampayana. He goes forth and meets his returning army, but hears the following strange account from his generals: while the army was camped at Lake Acchoda, Vaishampayana went into a state of trance and seemed to be searching for something. He now refuses to be separated from the lake. # Chandrapeeda becomes anxious for his friend and sets out in search of him, having taken leave of his parents. However, he finds no trace of Vaishampayana at Lake Acchoda. He meets Mahashveta however, who narrates the following story. She saw a young Brahmin wandering about, who made passionate advances of love towards her. She was inflamed by anger, and cursed him that he would turn into a parrot. That very moment he fell lifeless on the ground. It was only later that she learnt that the youth was Chandrapeeda's friend Vaishampayana. # Chandrapeeda is rendered unconscious by this news. At this moment, Kadambari (who has told her parents that she is leaving to see Mahashveta), arrives at the scene, accompanied by Patralekha. They both fall into a swoon after seeing Chandrapeeda lying on the ground. When Kadambari recovers, still thinking that Chandrapeeda is dead, she prepares to immolate herself on his funeral pyre. # At this moment, a disembodied voice calls out from the sky: 'My child Mahashveta, the body of Pundarika is in my world. He remains imperishable until he unites with you. On the other hand, although Chandrapeeda's soul has fled because of a curse; his body is made of light, and thus forever imperishable. Kadambari must see to it that his body is carefully guarded.' Everyone is astonished. Patralekha exclaims that it is not proper for Indrayudha to remain on earth while his master is no more. She mounts him, and throws herself along with the horse into the Acchoda lake. # The very next moment, Kapinjala emerges from the lake. Mahashveta is delighted to see her lover Pundarika's friend, and is curious to know his tale. Kapinjala narrates as follows: I chased the heavenly being who had carried aloft Pundarika's body (Paragraph 11) to the moon world. This being declared himself to be the Moon God. # The latter said to Kapinjala: ' I was once cursed by your friend (Pundarika) for no sound reason, that I would suffer from unrequited love more than once. I cursed him back saying that he would share my agonies. However, once I discovered that he is the lover of Mahashveta (who has a kinship with my race), I brought his body here to preserve it. You (Kapinjala) should go and consult the sage Shvetaketu (Paragraph 8) about seeking his son's deliverance.' # Kapinjala continues: 'As I hurled myself towards Shvetaketu, I inadvertently ran over an irascible sage who cursed me that I would become a horse. I implored his pardon. The sage relented and said that the curse would only last until my rider was alive. I further requested him that even as a horse, I should not be separated from my friend Pundarika. Thereupon, the sage told me that the Moon God would be born upon the earth as Tarapeeda's son, who would be my rider. Pundarika would be reborn as the chief minister's son and a companion to my rider. After hearing this, I fell into the ocean below, and reemerged as a horse. # Since I had retained memories of my past life even after having turned into a horse, I purposefully brought Chandrapeeda here in pursuit of the Kinnara couple. Vaishampayana, the youth cursed by you (Mahashveta), was in fact Pundarika himself in his earlier birth.' This closes the narration of Kapinjala begun in Paragraph 21. Mahashveta is heartbroken at the fact that she has lost her lover for a second time. # Kadambari enquires after Patralekha who had entered the lake with the horse. However, Kapinjala knows nothing about this, and he leaps into the sky to meet Shvetaketu. Kadambari whiles away her time watching over Chandrapeeda's lifeless body, which shows no signs of decay. # A messenger sent by Kadambari informs Chandrapeeda's parents of their son's plight. Tarapeeda, Vilasavati, Shukanasa and Manorama arrive at the scene, and are very sorrowful. Tarapeeda gives up all worldly pleasures, and begins to spend his days in the forest near his son's body. Jabali reveals that Vaishampayana (who was cursed by Mahashveta) is the very parrot who is present in the hermitage with them. This ends the narrative of Jabali, begun in Paragraph 2. # The parrot Vaishampayana continues his narration. He says: 'After Jabali had finished, all of my past life came back to me. I requested him to tell me something of my friend Chandrapeeda's present birth, but he was dismissive. Jabali told me that although as Pundarika I was an ascetic; I came under the pall of sensual desire, because I was born only of a woman's seed (Paragraph 8) and hence lacked the requisite element of manliness. # After the assembly in Jabali's hermitage has broken up for the night, I (the parrot) became sorrowful at my own degradation from the state of an ascetic Brahmin to that of an animal. At the very moment, the sage Kapinjala arrived at the hermitage. He embraced me and wept with joy. Kapinjala told me (the parrot): 'I have met your father Shvetaketu, who directed me here. Your woes are about to end.' Afterwards, Kapinjala left the hermitage. # Eventually, my wings grew stronger, and I could fly. I set off in the northern direction to meet Mahashveta. On my way I fell asleep due to fatigue, and when I woke up, found myself caught in a snare laid by a Chandala (forest-dweller). I was taken to a Chandala girl who said to me, \\"Ah my son! You cannot leave me now.\\" Then she brought me here in a golden cage, and made a present of myself to you (King Shudraka). I do not know who this girl is, and why she calls me her son.' This ends the narration of the parrot (begun in Paragraph 1). # King Shudraka becomes curious and summons the Chandala girl. The girl tells the king that she is Lakshmi, Pundarika's mother (Paragraph 8). Moreover, the king is no other than Chandrapeeda (the Moon God). The mutual curses between the Moon and Pundarika are now at an end. At these words, the king remembers everything in his former life, and slumps in a state of love-sickness for Kadambari. # At Mahashveta's hermitage, the season of spring arrives gloriously. Chandrapeeda is brought back to life by the touch of Kadambari's hand. He says that since the curse is over, he has abandoned the earthly body of Shudraka. Pundarika appears from heaven in the form in which Mahashveta had fallen in love with him. Both the couples are united. The parents of all the lovers gather around them, and everyone is overcome with joy. # One day, Kadambari asks Chandrapeeda about Patralekha's whereabouts. Chandrapeeda tells her that Patralekha is in fact Rohini (a demigoddess and a spouse of the Moon) who had come to the mortal world to take care of Chandrapeeda during his curse. Kadambari and Chandrapeeda enjoy their first sexual union. Chandrapeeda returns to Ujjayini, and installs Pundarika as the King. He divides his days between Ujjayini and Mount Hemaketu. The two couples live in eternal happiness.  Editions and translations  * (1896) C. M. Ridding, The KƒÅdambarƒ´ of BƒÅ·πáa.

Theophilos Hatzimihail ( or ŒòŒµœåœÜŒπŒªŒøœÇ ŒöŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒ¨œÇ; born c. 1870, Vareia, near Mytilene, island of Lesbos; died in Vareia, Greece, 24 March 1934), known simply as Theophilos, was a major folk painter of modern Greek art. The main subject of his works are Greek characters and the illustration of Greek traditional folklife and history. Life and work The exact birthdate of Theophilos is unknown. However, it is believed that he was born between 1867 and 1870 in Vareia (ŒíŒ±œÅŒµŒπŒ¨), a village outside of Mytilene (then part of the Ottoman Empire). His father, Gabriil Kefalas, was a shoemaker, while his mother Pinelopi Hatzimihail was a daughter of an iconographer. When he was very young he was mediocre at school, but he had a special interest in painting, having learned the basics from his grandfather. His life was very hard, partially because people made fun of him since he often wore the traditional Greek kilt, the fustanella, in public. At the age of 18 he abandoned his home and family and worked as a gate-keeper (Œ∫Œ±Œ≤Œ¨œÉŒ∑œÇ, kavasis) at the Greek consulate in Smyrna. He stayed in Smyrna for a few years before he settled in the city of Volos in about 1897, searching for occasional work and painting in houses and shops of the area. Many of his murals exist today. Most of his years he spent in Ano Volos. His protector during that period was the landholder Giannis Kontos, for whom he did many works. Today the house of Kontos is the Theophilos Museum. As well as painting, he was also involved in organizing popular theatrical acts for national ceremonies, and in the carnival period he had a major role, sometimes dressing as Alexander the Great, with pupils in Macedonian phalanx formation, and sometimes as a hero of the Greek Revolution, with gear and costumes made by himself. In 1927 he returned to Mytilene. Legend states that he left Volos because of an incident in a kafeneio (coffee shop) where someone played a joke on him in front of others and threw him down from a ladder where he was painting. In Mytilene, despite the mockery of the people, he continued to draw, painting many murals in villages for little payment, usually for a plate of food and a cup of wine.In the novella Vasilis Arvanitis, Stratis Myrivilis describes a coffee house near the Karini spring in Lesbos as famous because ‚Äúits walls, inside and out, are covered with pictures and designs by the painter Theophilos.‚Äù Of Theophilos himself he writes: ‚ÄúHe was a strange man and people thought him half crazy.‚Äù (Stratis Myrivilis, Vasilis Arvanitis, translated into English by Pavlos Andronikos [Armidale: University of New England Publishing Unit, 1983], pp. 51-2.) Many of his works of this period have been lost, either due to natural aging or from damage by the owners. In Mytilene, the renowned art critic and publisher Stratis Eletheriadis (T√©riade), who lived in Paris, discovered Theophilos and brought him a great deal of recognition and also international publicity, though posthumous. With T√©riade's funding in 1964 the Museum of Theophilos was constructed in Vareia, Lesbos. Theophilos died in March 1934, on the eve of the Annunciation, perhaps from food poisoning. One year later, his works were exhibited in the Louvre as a sample of a genuine folk painter of Greece.

This woreda is named after the Irob people, who are the predominant ethnic group living there. Located in the Misraqawi Zone at the eastern escarpment of the Ethiopian highlands, Irob is bordered on the south by Saesi Tsaedaemba, on the west by Gulomahda, on the north and east by the Endelli River which separates it from Eritrea, and on the southeast by the Afar Region. The administrative center of this woreda is Dawhan; other towns include Alitena, the former administrative center.  Overview The woreda is traditionally divided into three parts: Buknite-Arae (the present Waraatele, Aiga, Harze Sebaata, Agar Lekoma and Edamossa kebeles), Adgadi-Arae (the present Edalgeda kebele) and Hassaballa (the present Arae kebele). Elevations range from about 150 meters above sea level where the eastward-flowing Endelli leaves Irob to Mounts Asimba (3,250 meters) and Ayga.Tesfay Ghebray Woldemariam, \\"Terrain analysis of Irob land and its relevance to natural resources management, Irob, Northern Ethiopia\\", Masters' Thesis p. 2 (IRROB website; accessed 7 April 2011) Landmarks in Irob woreda include the Assabol Dam near Dawhan, and the monastery of Gunda Gunde. Both Irob woreda and its urban center of Alitena were occupied by the Eritrean army during the early months of the Eritrean- Ethiopian War. They reportedly inflicted a great amount of damage to Alitena.Paul B. Henze, \\"Visits to the Irob Area\\" , IRROB website (accessed 8 April 2011)  Demographics  Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this woreda has a total population of 25,471, an increase of 43.29% over the 1994 census, of whom 12,412 are men and 13,059 women; 2,091 or 8.21% are urban inhabitants. With an area of 1,532.64 square kilometers, Irob has a population density of 16.62, which is less than the Zone average of 56.93 persons per square kilometer. A total of 5,363 households were counted in this woreda, resulting in an average of 4.75 persons to a household, and 5,165 housing units. The majority of the inhabitants said they practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 55.99% reporting that as their religion, while 40.64% of the population were Catholics, and 3.31% were Muslim.Census 2007 Tables: Tigray Region , Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 and 3.4. The 1994 national census reported a total population for this woreda of 17,776 of whom 8,663 were men and 9,113 were women; 490 or 2.76% of its population were urban dwellers. The two largest ethnic groups reported in this woreda were the Irob (91.83%) and the Tigrayan (6.94%); all other ethnic groups made up 1.23% of the population. Saho is spoken as a first language by 89.36%, and 10.5% speak Tigrinya; the remaining 0.14% spoke all other primary languages reported. The majority of the inhabitants were Catholic, with 51.63% of the population reporting that as their faith, while 44.3% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 4.04% were Muslim. Concerning education, 17.96% of the population were considered literate, which is greater than the Zone average of 9.01%; 29.15% of children aged 7‚Äì12 were in primary school; 1.59% of the children aged 13‚Äì14 were in junior secondary school; and 3.94% of the inhabitants aged 15‚Äì18 were in senior secondary school. Concerning sanitary conditions, all of the urban houses and 10.3% of all houses had access to safe drinking water at the time of the census; none of the urban and about 2% of the total had toilet facilities.1994 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Results for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, Vol. 1, part 1 , Tables 2.1, 2.12, 2.19, 3.5, 3.7, 6.3, 6.11, 6.13 (accessed 30 December 2008)  Agriculture  Irob farming is distinguished by its terraced crop lands, known as Daldal. The local farmers build a series of check dams in the seasonal watercourses to trap the silt washed down them, which they gradually raise and lengthen, until after several years a series of step-like terraces are created, which are up to 10 meters high and about 8 meters wide, with about 20 meters between dams. These terraces are then used for farming or grazing. Building daldals is a relatively recent innovation, having been started by two farmers in Awo village in the late 1940s, and advocated by an Irob elder, Zigta Gebre Medhin, starting in the early 1960s.\\"Best Practices on Indigenous Knowledge: Ethiopia BP-II.09: Daldal: dams to trap silt and water, an Irob innovation in northern Ethiopia\\" (accessed 9 April 2011) A sample enumeration performed by the CSA in 2001 interviewed 4,045 farmers in this woreda, who held an average of 0.19 hectares of land. Of the 787 hectares of private land surveyed, 80.56% was in cultivation, 3.94% pasture, 0.89% fallow, 0.51% woodland, and 14.23% was devoted to other uses. For the land under cultivation in this woreda, 53.88% was planted in cereals, 2.03% in pulses, and 0.25% in oilseeds. Fruit trees were planted in 191 hectares. 76.54% of the farmers both raised crops and livestock, while 12.44% only grew crops and 11.03% only raised livestock.

When producing a dish made of eggs with ham or bacon, the pig provides the ham or bacon which requires his or her sacrifice and the chicken provides the eggs which are not difficult to produce. Thus the pig is really committed to that dish while the chicken is only involved, yet both are needed to produce the dish. Content The fable of the Chicken and the Pig is used to illustrate the differing levels of commitment from project stakeholders involved in a project. The basic fable runs:Pupek, Daniel (date unknown). Chicken and Pig Make Breakfast. Retold in the blog of \\"The Agile Jedi\\". Retrieved from http://www.agilejedi.com/chickenandpig. ::A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road. ::The Chicken says: \\"Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!\\" ::Pig replies: \\"Hm, maybe, what would we call it?\\" ::The Chicken responds: \\"How about 'ham-n-eggs'?\\" ::The Pig thinks for a moment and says: \\"No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved.\\" Sometimes, the story is presented as a riddle: ::Question: In a bacon-and-egg breakfast, what's the difference between the Chicken and the Pig? ::Answer: The Chicken is involved, but the Pig commits! Interpretation and lessons The fable has been used mostly in contexts where a strong team is needed for success, for example in sports or in Agile software development. Agile project management The fable was referenced to define two types of project members by the scrum framework: pigs, who are totally committed to the project and accountable for its outcome, and chickens, who consult on the project and are informed of its progress. This analogy is based upon the pig being able to provide bacon (a sacrificial offering, for which the pig must die in order to provide) versus a chicken which provides eggs (non- sacrificial). For a Scrum project the Development Team, Product Owners & Scrum Masters are considered as people who are committed to the project while stakeholders, customers and executive management are considered as involved but not committed to the project.Ken Schwaber - Agile Project Management with SCRUM - 2004 - Microsoft Professional - As of 2011, the fable has been removed from the official Scrum framework. Sports The fable also is used as an analogy for levels of commitment to a game, team etc. For example, variations of this quote have been attributed to football coach Mike Leach who said, on the officials in the 2007 Tech-Texas game in Austin: \\"It's a little like breakfast; you eat ham and eggs. As coaches and players, we're like the ham. You see, the chicken's involved but the pig's committed. We're like the pig, they're like the chicken. They're involved, but everything we have rides on this.\\" See also * Skin in the game (phrase), risking one's own money References External links *Chicken and Pig Cartoon - ImplementingScrum.com *Lessons from a Yahoo Scrum Rollout *Dilbert variant Category:Project management Category:Business fables Category:Fictional chickens Category:Fictional pigs Category:Fictional duos ","title":"The Chicken and the Pig"},{"id":"7244201","text":"Ludovisi Gaul, H. 2.11 m (6 ft. 11 in.), Palazzo Altemps The Ludovisi Gaul Killing Himself and His Wife (sometimes called \\"The Galatian Suicide\\") is a Roman marble group depicting a Gallic man in the act of plunging a sword into his breast, looking backwards defiantly while he supports the dying figure of a woman with his left arm. It is a Roman copy of the early 2nd century AD, of a Hellenistic original, ca 230-20 BC, one of the bronze groups commissioned from Greek sculptors by Attalus I after his recent victories over the Gauls of Galatia. Other Roman marble copies from the same project are the equally famous Dying Gaul, and the less well-known Kneeling Gaul. The sculpture group made its first appearance in a Ludovisi inventory taken 2 February 1623, and was possibly found in the grounds of the Villa Ludovisi, Rome, shortly before that. The area had been part of the Gardens of Sallust in Classical times, and proved a rich source of Roman (and some Greek) sculpture through the 19th century (Haskell and Penny, 282). Among the last of the finds at Villa Ludovisi, before the area was built over, was the Ludovisi Throne. The sculpture, now in the Museo Nazionale di Roma, Palazzo Altemps, Rome, was greatly admired from the 17th century. It appeared in engravings in the repertory of sculpture in Rome by PerrierFran√ßois Perrier, Segmenta nobilium signorum et statuarum que temporis dentem invidium evase, 1638, pl. 32. and was codified by AudranG√©rard Audran, Les proportions du corps humain mesur√©es sur les belles figures de l'Antiquit√©, 1683, pls 8 and 9. as one of the sculptures of Antiquity that defined the canon of fine proportions of the human body. Nicolas Poussin adapted the figure for the group in the right foreground of his Rape of the Sabine Women, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Friedlaender 19 and fig. 108). Visitors and writers of guidebooks found many subjects drawn from Roman history to account for the action: the 1633 Ludovisi inventory lists it as \\"a certain Marius who kills his daughter and himself\\",\\"un certo mario ch'ammazza sua figlia e se stesso\\" (quoted Haskell and Penny 282). drawing upon the story of a certain patrician Sextus Marius, who in seeking to protect his daughter from the lust of Tiberius, was accused of incest with her. Giovanni Francesco Susini rendered the group in a small bronze. The marble was copied by Fran√ßois Lespingola for Louis XIV and may still be seen paired with the Laoco√∂n at the entrance to the Tapis Vert at Versailles; the cast prepared in preparation for the copy was retained at the French Academy in Rome (where it remains). The Ludovisi heirs prohibited further casts, but in 1816‚Äì19 Prince Luigi Boncompagni Ludovisi sent plaster casts to the Prince Regent; the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Prince Metternich; and the diplomat at the Congress of Vienna, Wilhelm von Humboldt (Haskell and Penny 284).

It is the third part of what the director's fans have dubbed \\"The Blood Trilogy\\", including Blood Feast (1963) and Two Thousand Maniacs! (1964).  Plot  Gallery owner Farnsworth takes a painting outside and burns it. Blood pours out of the canvas as it burns. Artist Adam Sorg is having trouble with his work. He is unsatisfied with every color he has. Gigi, Adam's girlfriend, reminds Adam he is expected at the Farnsworth Galleries for a showing with critics. At the showing, Gregorovich, an art critic, criticizes Adam's use of color. Adam argues with him and leaves, passing Mrs. Carter admiring Adam's work. The next day, Farnsworth goes to Adam's house to pick up a new painting. He tells Adam that he agrees with Gregorovich's criticism, but takes a painting and leaves. Adam destroys another canvas and leaves the wreckage on the floor. Gigi cuts herself while cleaning it up, smearing blood on the canvas by accident. Later, Adam sees the blood and compares the color to his other paintings. He asks Gigi to re-open the cut and begins another painting using her blood. She eventually tells him to use his own blood. Adam cuts his fingers and paints with his blood until he collapses from blood loss. When he wakes up, Gigi tells him that he phoned Farnsworth and bragged about his new painting. She wonders where he will find enough blood to finish the painting. Adam stabs Gigi in the face and uses her blood to finish the painting. He buries Gigi's body near his house. The next day, he takes the painting to the gallery. Gregotovich declares it Adam's finest work. Mrs. Carter offers to buy the painting for $15,000, but Adam refuses. Gregotovich challenges Adam to paint another masterpiece and Adam agrees. The next day, Mrs. Carter's daughter April goes on a picnic with her boyfriend Rolf, and two other friends, Jack and Sydney. Adam prepares to cut himself for a new painting when he sees April and her friends on the beach near his house. Adam prepares to ambush them, but is diverted by another couple on the beach. The pair go into the water, where Adam approaches them in a motorboat. He kills the man and abducts the woman. Later, Adam paints a new canvas with the woman's blood. The following day, he takes it to the gallery but again refuses to sell it. Adam storms out of the gallery, and Gregorovich notes that the painting is still wet. Mrs. Carter wonders why she hasn't heard from Adam in weeks; he has become a recluse. Adam spies on April and her friends having another beach party. When April ventures near Adam's house, Adam goes to talk to her. He tells April he is looking for a model. He introduces himself and she tells him that her mother is the Mrs. Carter who wants to buy some of his paintings. Adam tells April that if she poses for him, she can have one for free. April returns to her friends. She tells them about meeting Adam and her plans to see him again that evening. That evening, April inadvertently angers Adam by making a joke about blood in his paintings. She wants to leave after his outburst, but Adam convinces her to stay. He has her stand on a small stepladder and ties her wrists. Meanwhile, Jack and Sydney find Gigi's badly decomposed corpse on the beach. They show the body to Rolf, who runs towards Adam's house. Inside, Adam lifts up an axe to kill April. Rolf runs inside and sees Adam with the axe. Rolf grabs a nearby shotgun and points it at Adam, keeping him at bay as he unties April. Adam knocks the shotgun out of Rolf's hands and says he is immortalizing people by using their blood in his paintings. Jack and Sydney run into the house and distract Adam. Rolf grabs the shotgun and shoots Adam, killing him. Farnsworth is burning Adam's paintings. His use of blood has become public knowledge. Gregorovich arrives, and Farnsworth says this is Adam's funeral pyre.

The kiss and cry is the area in a figure skating rink where figure skaters wait for their marks to be announced after their performances during a figure skating competition.\\"kiss-and-cry area\\" definition from Double-Tongued Dictionary It is so named because the skaters and coaches often kiss to celebrate after a good performance, or cry after a poor one. The area is usually located in the corner or end of the rink and is furnished with a bench or chairs for the skaters and coaches and monitors to display the competition results. It is often elaborately decorated with flowers or some other backdrop for television shots and photos of the skaters as they react to their performance and scores. The term was coined by Jane Erkko, a Finnish figure skating official who was on the organizing committee for the 1983 World Figure Skating Championships which were held in Helsinki. Erkko came up with the name when visiting television technicians who were mapping the arena prior to the event wanted to know what the area was called.Sonia Bianchetti Garbato, Cracked Ice. . pp. 45‚Äì56Erkko, coiner of 'kiss and cry,' passes away at 78 The first formal off-ice waiting area at the Olympics appeared in Sarajevo 1984.

He is also the youngest son of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona and Princess Mar√≠a de las Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, and the grandson of King Alfonso XIII. Early life Alfonso was born at Anglo-American Hospital in Rome, the youngest son of the Infante Juan of Spain, Count of Barcelona, and of his wife, Princess Maria Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. His godfather was the Infante Alfonso de Orleans y Borb√≥n; his godmother was his father's sister Infanta Maria Cristina of Spain.Jos√© Mar√≠a Zavala, Dos infantes y un destino (Barcelona: Planez & Jan√©s, 1998), 101. Within his own family he was called Alfonsito to distinguish him from other family members with the name Alfonso.

In February 1946 the family moved to the Portuguese Riviera.Zavala, 111. In 1947 Alfonso visited Spain for the first time at the invitation of caudillo Francisco Franco.

Death and burial Coat of arms of Infante Alfonso On the evening of Maundy Thursday, 29 March 1956, Alfonso and Juan Carlos were at their parents' home Villa Giralda in Estoril, Portugal, for the Easter vacation, where Alfonso died in a gun accident. The Spanish Embassy in Portugal issued an official communiqu√©:Quoted in Paul Preston, Juan Carlos: Steering Spain from Dictatorship to Democracy (New York: W.W. Norton, 2004), 101. : Whilst His Highness the Infante Alfonso was cleaning a revolver last evening with his brother, a shot was fired hitting his forehead and killing him in a few minutes. The accident took place at 20.30 hours, after the Infante's return from the Maundy Thursday religious service, during which he had received Holy Communion. Alfonso had won a local junior golf tournament earlier on the day, then went to evening Mass and rushed up to the room to see Juan Carlos who had come home for the Easter holidays from military school. It is alleged that Juan Carlos began playing with a .22 caliber revolver that had apparently been given to Alfonso by General Franco. Rumors appeared in newspapers that the .22 caliber revolver had actually been held by Juan Carlos at the moment the shot was fired. As they were the only two in the room, it is unclear how Alfonso was shot but according to Josefina Carolo, dressmaker to Juan Carlos's mother, Juan Carlos pointed the pistol at Alfonso and pulled the trigger, unaware that the pistol was loaded. Bernardo Arnoso, a Portuguese friend of Juan Carlos, also said that Juan Carlos fired the pistol not knowing that it was loaded, and adding that the bullet ricocheted off a wall hitting Alfonso in the face. Helena Matheopoulos, a Greek author who spoke with Juan Carlos's sister Pilar, said that Alfonso had been out of the room and when he returned and pushed the door open, the door knocked Juan Carlos in the arm causing him to fire the pistol.Preston, 102.A Royal Mystery at Snopes.com. It is alleged that Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, the childrens' father, had thrown the gun into the sea sometime after Alfonso's death. The funeral liturgy for Alfonso was held on Holy Saturday and was presided by Monsignor Fernando Cento, Apostolic Nuncio to Portugal. He was buried at the municipal cemetery in Cascais, Portugal.

The building served as a social gathering place, playhouse, and meeting hall as well as the Headquarters for the Tourist Club. The Community Building once hosted a zoo that consisted of a bear named \\"Alice\\", an alligator, monkeys and other animals. The site of the zoo is now occupied by Pocahantas Park. In 1943 a north wing was added to the building in order for it to become a servingmen's club. Organized by director Dale Wimbrow, the addition consisted of lounge, a restroom, and showers. After World War II, the 1943 addition became the Indian River Citrus Museum. On January 19, 1993, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

After its predecessor F.C. Esperia Viareggio, which was excluded from professional leagues in 2014, \\"Viareggio 2014\\" applied as its successor and was admitted in Eccellenza Tuscany. However, Esperia Viareggio continued to play in Terza Categoria from 2014 to 2017. Viareggio 2014, as of 2018‚Äì19 season, plays in the Italian Serie D/Group E, the fourth highest division in the Italian football pyramid. History Esperia 1911 Esperia was a football club founded in Viareggio in 1911. Viareggio Calcio, A.S. Viareggio Calcio and A.C. Viareggio Viareggio Calcio was founded in 1919 by a merger of 6 football clubs: Esperia, Libertas, Vigor, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Aquila and Celeritas. The club was re-founded in 1939 as A.S. Viareggio Calcio and again as A.C. Viareggio in 1994. Viareggio played in Serie B between 1933‚Äì1937 and 1946‚Äì1948. Viareggio also spent several seasons in Serie C, notably from 1990 to 1994 and from 1997 to 2002. In 2000s the club was acquired by the European School of Economics from Bruno Fanciullacci. The club then known as A.C. E.S.E. Viareggio. A.C. E.S.E. Viareggio was dissolved due to bankruptcy in June 2003. The former chairman of the club Vincenzo Lombino (alias: Marvin Tracy) was charged for withdrawing money from the club with false invoices. The school itself was involved in an alleged money laundering scandal.  Esperia Viareggio After the defunct of A.C. Viareggio, Esperia Viareggio became a successor of the club. The founding chairman of Esperia Viareggio was Mirko Lippi, but was soon replaced by Stefano Dinelli, which was the chairman from 2003 to circa 2014. However, the new club did not acquire the assets of the old club. It was reported that former A.C. Viareggio chairman Bruno Fanciullacci had acquired the assets of the old club by auction. The name \\"Esperia Viareggio\\" is a homage to the first team founded in the city, Esperia 1911. It was reported that the Comitato Regionale Toscana, the organizer of Eccellenza Tuscany, had accepted the application of Lippi's Esperia Viareggio as a phoenix club, instead of Fanciullacci's Viareggio. Promoted in 2006 after having won Eccellenza Tuscany and Coppa Italia Dilettanti, Esperia Viareggio gained its second consecutive promotion on 22 April 2007 by winning Group E of Serie D four matches before the end of the season. At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione season, the club was admitted to Lega Pro Prima Divisione for the first time in its history. Long serving players retired including Samuele Barsotti and Giuseppe Costantino in 2010 and Michele Fusi in 2009. Alberto Reccolani also left the club. In 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 the team finished the season in the relegation places, but managed to win play-offs to remain in the Lega Pro Prima Divisione. In 2010‚Äì11 the only defenders on a long-term contract were Lorenzo Fiale and Sergio Carnesalini, whilst others were borrowed from other teams. The starting goalkeeper Carlo Pinsoglio was loaned from Juventus and called up to the Italy national under-21 football team during his stay with club. In 2014 the club was excluded from the new third-tier Lega Pro for economic reasons. However, Esperia Viareggio was later admitted to 2014‚Äì15 Terza Categoria season. Viareggio 2014 In August 2014, thanks to the article 52 of N.O.I.F., a new club was admitted to Eccellenza Tuscany as a successor. Colors and badge logo of now defunct F.C. Esperia Viareggio The club's main colors are white and black, serving as inspiration for the club's nickname, [Le] Zebre, which stands for \\"The Zebras.\\" The logo of now defunct Esperia Viareggio, featured zebra stripe and an anchor. In 2012‚Äì13 season, Burlamacco, a local crown figure, was also added to the jersey. Esperia Viareggio wore a temporarily logo \\"Viareggio Ricorda\\" in 2009, as a memorial of Viareggio train derailment. S.S.D.

Close to the village lies the former WW II airfield RAF Shepherds Grove, where American forces were based. One of the main landmarks in the village is the fine restored windmill at Upthorpe Farm, to the east of the village. The name \\" Stanton\\" means 'a homestead on stony ground'. History It's believed the site of the village has been continuously occupied since Roman times Stanton dates back to Roman times, sited at the junction of Peddars Way and the Roman road believed to run between Camulodunum (Colchester) and Bildeston. The site of a Roman Villa known as 'Stanton Chare' is at the junction of the two ancient routes. The Manor of Stanton was held for many years by Abbots of Bury St Edmunds, and subsequently by the Capell Lofft family name. The present parish was formed from two earlier parishes, Stanton All Saints and Stanton St John. The former St John's Church, on a prominent hill outside the village, was abandoned and services continued at All Saints in the village centre. Upthorpe Mill Upthorpe Mill was built in 1751 at a site on the other side of the village to where it is today. It was moved to its present site in 1808 and worked until the First World War. Repairs carried out in 1939 returned it to working order and the mill was restored in 1990. Schools There is a Primary school, Stanton Pre-School and a nursery. The primary school predominantly feeds through to either Ixworth free school or Thurston Community College. Miscellaneous The eleven member Parish Council meets on the second Thursday of every month in the Terry Bray room of the village hall. The one local pub is 'The Cock Inn' There are two open churches, All Saints (Church of England), and a Methodist church. The disused church of St Johns holds occasional services. All Saints and St Johns are part of the United Benefice of Stanton, Hopton, Market Weston, Barningham & Coney Weston.

One or more members of the NFAT family is expressed in most cells of the immune system. NFAT is also involved in the development of cardiac, skeletal muscle, and nervous systems. NFAT was first discovered as an activator for the transcription of interleukin-2 in T cells, as a regulator for T cell immune response, but has since been found to play an important role in regulating many other body systems. NFAT transcription factors are involved in many normal body processes as well as in development of several diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and several types of cancer. NFAT is also being investigated as a drug target for several different disorders.  Family members  The NFAT transcription factor family consists of five members NFATc1, NFATc2, NFATc3, NFATc4, and NFAT5. NFATc1 through NFATc4 are regulated by calcium signaling, and are known as the classical members of the NFAT family. NFAT5 is a more recently discovered member of the NFAT family that has special characteristics that differentiate it from other NFAT members. Calcium signaling is critical to NFAT activation because calmodulin (CaM), a well-known calcium sensor protein, activates the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CN). Activated CN rapidly dephosphorylates the serine-rich region (SRR) and SP- repeats in the amino termini of NFAT proteins, resulting in a conformational change that exposes a nuclear localization signal, resulting in NFAT nuclear import. NFATc1 and NFAT c2 mRNAs are expressed in peripheral lymphoid tissue, while NFATc4 is highly expressed in the thymus. NFATc3 mRNA however, is expressed at low levels in lymphoid tissue.  Signaling and Binding  Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is key for controlling NFAT function by masking and unmasking nuclear localization signals, as shown by the high number of phosphorylation sites in the NFAT regulatory domain. Nuclear import of NFAT proteins is opposed by maintenance kinases in the cytoplasm and export kinases in the nucleus. Export kinases, such as PKA and GSK-3Œ≤, must be inactivated for NFAT nuclear retention. NFAT proteins have weak DNA-binding capacity. Therefore, to effectively bind DNA, NFAT proteins must cooperate with other nuclear resident transcription factors generically referred to as NFATn. This important feature of NFAT transcription factors enables integration and coincidence detection of calcium signals with other signaling pathways such as ras-MAPK or PKC. In addition, this signaling integration is involved in tissue-specific gene expression during development. A screen of ncRNA sequences identified in EST sequencing projects discovered a 'ncRNA repressor of the nuclear factor of activated T cells' called NRON. The best known classes of binding sites for NFAT are the formation of a cooperative complex with AP-1 or other bZIP proteins to form a composite NFAT:AP-1 site that is involved in gene transcription in immune cells and the binding to sites for conventional Rel-family proteins. NFAT-dependent promoters and enhancers tend to have 3-5 NFAT binding sites, which indicates that higher order, synergistic interactions between the relevant proteins in a cooperative complex is needed for effective transcription.  NFAT and AP-1  The best known classes of binding sites for NFAT are the formation of a cooperative complex with AP-1 or other bZIP proteins and the binding to sites for conventional Rel-family proteins. NFAT5 cannot form complexes with AP-1 proteins, however all NFAT proteins recognize similar DNA binding sites in gene regulatory regions. Activation of NFAT and AP-1 is known to be required for productive immune responses. Cooperation of NFAT with AP-1 is required for many different genes to be transcribed including IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-3, and IFN-Œ≥. In the thymus, FasL expression, which allows for potential cell death, also requires cooperation between NFAT and AP-1. This cooperation plays an important role in the cell survival or cell death checkpoint for developing T cells.  NFAT signaling in Neural Development  The Ca2+ dependent calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway has been found to be important in neuronal growth and axon guidance during vertebrate development. Each different class of NFAT contributes to different steps in the neural development. NFAT works with neurotrophic signaling to regulate axon outgrowth in several neuronal populations. Additionally, NFAT transcription complexes integrate neuronal growth with guidance cues such as netrin to facilitate the formation of new synapses, helping to build neural circuits in the brain. NFAT is a known important player in both the developing and adult nervous system.  Clinical Significance   Inflammation  NFAT plays a role in the regulation of inflammation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the gene that encodes LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), a susceptibility locus for IBD was found. The kinase LRRK2 is an inhibitor for the NFATc2 variety, so in mice lacking LRRK2, increased activation of NFATc2 was found in macrophages. This led to an increase in the NFAT-dependent cytokines that spark severe colitis attacks. NFAT also plays a role in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease that has a strong pro-inflammatory component. TNF-Œ±, a pro- inflammatory cytokine, activates the calcineurin-NFAT pathway in macrophages. Additionally, inhibiting the mTOR pathway decreases joint inflammation and erosion, so the known interaction between mTOR pathway and NFAT presents a key to the inflammatory process of RA.  As a drug target  Due to its essential role in the production of the T-cell proliferative cytokine interleukin-2, NFAT signaling is an important pharmacological target for the induction of immunosuppression. CN inhibitors, which prevent the activation of NFAT, including cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506), are used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis and to prevent the rejection of organ transplants. However, there is a toxicity associated with these drugs due to their ability to inhibit CN in non-immune cells, which limits their use in other situations that may call for immunosuppressing drug therapy, including allergy and inflammation. There are other compounds that target NFAT directly, as opposed to targeting the phosphatase activity of calcineurin, that may have broad immunosuppressive effects but lack the toxicity of CsA and FK506. Because individual NFAT proteins exist in specific cell types or affect specific genes, it may be possible to inhibit individual NFAT protein functions for an even more selective immune effect.
