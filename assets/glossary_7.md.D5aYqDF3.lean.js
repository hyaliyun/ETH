It constitutes about 20% of government spending, and has been roughly stable in the past several decades. The Constitution of Poland states that all citizens have the right to social security in case of being unable to find a job, reaching the retirement age, or suffering from inability to work due to illness or disability. In detail, the law on welfare in Poland is covered by a 2003 law, updated several times, including in 2012. Organization Article 67 of the Constitution of Poland states: \\"A citizen shall have the right to social security whenever incapacitated for work by reason of sickness or invalidism as well as having attained retirement age.\\" and \\"A citizen who is involuntarily without work and has no other means of support, shall have the right to social security.\\", and Article 33 adds that \\"Men and women shall have equal rights, in particular, regarding education, employment and promotion, and shall have the right to equal compensation for work of similar value, to social security, to hold offices, and to receive public honours and decorations.\\". Taxes, which may constitute up to a maximum of 50% of earned income, are the major source of finances for the Polish welfare system. Social insurance, also, plays a major role in the Polish welfare system. Benefits for Polish citizens are managed by Social Insurance Institution (Zak≈Çad Ubezpiecze≈Ñ Spo≈Çecznych, ZUS), by (Kasa Rolniczego Ubezpieczenia Spo≈Çecznego, KRUS), with the latter handling farmers' social security. The main provider of social services in Poland is the state government, followed by local and regional governments. There is some activity from NGOs and the Catholic Church. Major Polish NGOs that focus on welfare include Markot, Monar and the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity. History and trends The history of welfare system in Poland dates to late 18th century in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where first laws on the subject were passed. During the late 1980s, Poland spent about 22% of its GDP on welfare. Following the fall of communism in 1990 and transition of People's Republic of Poland into the present day Third Polish Republic, according to Rutkowski (1998), the welfare spending in Poland has risen. Contrary to popular expectations equating transformation from a communist to a capitalist system with reduction of the welfare state, the democratic political system led to the growth of the welfare state due to large public expectations that the state should meet social needs. Rutkowski (1998) also noted that Polish social protection system is \\"extremely generous\\" in comparison with most other OECD countries. Rutkowski (1998) noted that \\"social expenditures now account for a much larger share of the GDP than before the transition\\". According to Siemie≈Ñska, Domaradzka and Matysiak (2010-2013), \\"the [Polish] government expenditures as a share of GDP had been declining until 2000\\", at which point they reached an average of 20% of the GDP (European Union average is 28% of the GDP). Due to the economic recession that the economy of Poland suffered in the 1990s, spending in real terms in some areas that have remained stable as a percent of the GDP, such as education and medical services, have fallen. Public resources have been shifted to cash transfers, such as pensions, which have risen in real terms. Siemie≈Ñska, Domaradzka and Matysiak (2010-2013) note that unemployment benefits have been substantially reduced in the 1990s. As of 1998, spending on pensions was the biggest part of social spending in Poland and the pension system in Poland has been described as \\"one of the most costly... in Central and Eastern Europe.\\" Rutkowski (1998) has criticized the system as being \\"too generous\\" and offering too many opportunities for early retirement. Numbers According to OECD 2013 data, in the period 2000-2011, public expenditure on health has risen from 3.9% of the GDP in 2000 through 4.3% in 2004 to 5.0% in 2010; public social expenditure has remained relatively stable (20.5% of the GDP in 2000, 21.4% in 2004 and 20.7% in 2011), and public pension expenditure has also remained relatively stable with 11.4% of the GDP in 2005 and 11.8% in 2009. According to a 2011 report by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, in 2010 Polish government social expenditures in 2010 were 96 billion zloties, or 32.5% of the total Polish government budget. This formed 39% of the total social expenditures in Poland, which totaled 245 billion zloties. According to that report, social expenditure in Poland totaled 17.3% of GDP in 2010, of which the government covered 6,8%.

Owned by Ben Holladay, the Portland Street Railway Company used horsecars starting in December 1872. The narrow gauge line started at their barn on Glisan Avenue and went down First Street to Porter Avenue. History On September 6, 1871, the city of Portland granted the Portland Street Railway Company a 25-year franchise to operate their horsecar line down the length of First Street. At the time, most of Portland was located near the waterfront, making First Street the ideal spot for the new line. Construction of the line began on September 11, 1872. The horsecar rails were recycled from the Oregon Central Railroad by turning the iron upside down. Four \\"bobtail\\" cars were ordered for the company from Kimball & Company of San Francisco, California. After the cars arrived in October 1872 it was discovered that the cars would not fit the line and the entire track would have to be readjusted. For the first time the cars were run on the track on December 7, 1872. The company started with a total of four cars and ten horses. Ben Holladay, the owner of the company, put his younger brother, Joseph Holladay, in charge of the company. The expansion of Portland inland, away from First Street, increased demand for a separate car line by the 1880s. After Ben Holladay's death in 1887, the Portland Street Railway Company was caught up in his estate. His brother was ordered to sell off the company to settle the estate. Joseph Holladay refused and went to Vancouver, Washington, to avoid authorities. Caught up in litigation, the Holladay estate increased in value, eventually enough for Joseph Holladay to return to Portland to reclaim the car franchise.Labbe, p. 25 Upon Holladay's return he attempted to upgrade the line without success. He attempted to sell his company to property owners on First Street, but they wanted a new electric streetcar line. Finally, the city council granted the property owners of First Street an electric streetcar line with the condition that they buy out the horsecar company. After the First Street Railway Company took ownership they continued the horsecar line with just two cars, four horses and one conductor. When the contract expired in 1896 the company was dissolved.Labbe, p. 26 References Streetcars in Oregon Transportation in Portland, Oregon History of transportation in Oregon History of Portland, Oregon Defunct companies based in Oregon 1872 establishments in Oregon Railway companies established in 1872 3 ft 6 in gauge railways in the United States 1896 disestablishments in Oregon Tram, urban railway and trolley companies American companies established in 1872 ","title":"Portland Street Railway Company"},{"id":"38681954","text":"Miko≈Çaj Grzelak is a Polish footballer who plays as a defender.

It was built during 1937‚Äî42 for giving an alternate route for the Khabarovsk Bridge across the Amur River. This tunnel is the only underwater tunnel in the Russian Railroad System.–û–ê–û –†–ñ–î The concept of drilling a tunnel underneath the Amur River arose in connection with the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. In 1913, at the exhibition of the plans , there was a drawing of the tunnel, but the choice had already been made in favor of the bridge. During the 1930s, the construction of a second track for the Trans- Siberian Railroad east of Irkutsk was undertaken. The need to build this tunnel was caused by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and the loss of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Accordingly, the bridge at Krasnoyarsk was vulnerable to Japanese air raids. In 1936, because of the particular strategic importance for the country's Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Kremlin decided to build under the urging of the General Staff of the Red Army. The technical design of the underwater 7,200 meter-long tunnel was carried out in 1937 by the Metroproject Institute which was then in the People's Commissariat of Communications of the USSR The seven kilometer-long-railroad tunnel had been covered with five boards ??, 3627 meter-long mountain way?? (three faces) in the eastern sector, 1350 meters of open way in the western section, and an internal ?? diameter tunnel - 7400 mm for underwater. Using crushed stone, construction of houses and other surface structures carried out by railway troops. 900 experts in the primary professions and thousands of local civilian citizens worked directly in the tunnel under the Amur. About 5500 people worked only towards \\"construction ‚Ññ 4\\", a code name. Prisoners working in the Tunguska and in the New Stone ?? quarried limestone for buildings. The Magnitogorsk plant on the Ural River supplied the iron tubing to line the tunnel. –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∞—è –º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ / –°–æ—Å—Ç. –í. –§. –ë—É—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∞, –í. –§. –ó—É–µ–≤. ‚Äî –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫: –ß–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∞—è –∫–æ–ª–ª–µ–∫—Ü–∏—è, 1997. ‚Äî Shortly prior to the Great Patriotic War, the work was nearing completion. In 1941, after the outbreak of the war, Joseph Stalin set a time limit on completing the building of the railway. On 12 July 1941, the first train with builders on it ran through the tunnel. Regular traffic started on 25 October 1942. During 1944‚Äì45, cargo transportation for the upcoming invasion of Manchuria against Japan began. In accordance with the order of the People's Commissar of Railways Ivan Vladimirovich Kovalev of 22 May 1945 on the Far Eastern Railway to expedite the work, procedures was put in place to skip all forms of transportation and military compounds. After the fighting in the Far East was over in August 1945, the secret tunnel facility was temporarily closed. Because of the growth in freight traffic, there was the need to increase the capacity of the Trans- Siberian Railroad in 1964. The tunnel was the used for the movement of freight trains. After the completion of the electrification of the railway through the tunnel, passenger trains began to pass through it. Until 2008 the combination through Amur River was continued - on the railway bridge and the tunnel. In 2009, after completion of the second stage of the reconstruction of Amur bridge opening two-way traffic across it, the \\"bottleneck\\" problem has been removed. This made it possible to reconstruct the underwater tunnel, after which the construction of the Trans-Siberian Amur link was on three tracks - two on the bridge, and one in the tunnel. –ü—É—Ç—å –∫ —Ç–æ–Ω–Ω–µ–ª—é, –•–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫.JPG|Railroad to the east tunnel portal (right bank), Kirovsky City District, Khabarovsk –¢–æ–Ω–Ω–µ–ª—å –ø–æ–¥ –ê–º—É—Ä–æ–º –∏ —Ö–∞–±–∞—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç (–ª–µ–≤—ã–π –±–µ—Ä–µ–≥).JPG|On the left side of the fence - the left bank (west) portal, right - Khabarovsk Bridge left bank pier bridge.

The flag is a simplified combination of two single pennons, the vexillological word for a pennant. Its crimson red is the colour of the rhododendron, the country's national flower. Red is also the sign of victory in war. The blue border is the colour of peace. Until 1962, the flag's emblems, the sun and the crescent moon, had human faces. They were removed to modernize the flag.

They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos primigenius. Cows are not raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal), but as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products, and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks) (pulling carts, plows and the like). The national breed Achham cattle which falls in the Bos indicus species is understood to be the national animal. Flower Rhododendron arboreum Rhododendron (; lali gurans) is a genus of over 1000 species of woody plants in the heath family, either evergreen or deciduous. Most species have showy flowers. We know Lali means Red and Guras means Rhododendron, so lali guras means Rhododendron. Nepal's National Flower Rhododendron are found in the altitude range from 1200 meters to 3600 meters above the sea level. Language frameless The national language of Nepal is Nepali language.

Archeological remains from the Hallstatt period have been found in the area. In the 6th century, it was settled by Slavic tribes, ancestors of the modern Slovenes. During the Middle Ages, it was first part of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, and later of Tolmin County, before being included in the Habsburg Monarchy in the 15th century, like the majority of Slovene-speaking territories. With the exception of a brief period between 1809 and 1813, when it was included under the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, it remained under the Austrian rule until 1918. In the mid-19th century, the area became an important center of the Slovene national revival. During World War I, the whole area was the theatre of the Battles of the Isonzo, fought between Italy and Austria-Hungary. After the end of the war in 1918, the region was occupied by the Italian Army, and in 1920 it was officially annexed to Italy, and included in the Julian March region. Between 1922 and 1943, the Kobarid area, which had an exclusively Slovene-speaking population, was submitted to a policy of violent Fascist Italianization. Many locals emigrated to the neighbouring Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Several Italian military memorials were built in the area. Immediately after the Italian armistice in September 1943, the region was liberated by a Partisan uprising, and became the center of large liberated area of around 2,500 square kilometers known as the Kobarid Republic, administered by the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People. The area wa retaken by German forces in early November 1943, who remained until May 1945 and the arrival of the Yugoslav People's Army. In September 1947, the Paris Peace Treaties awarded the area to Yugoslavia. Several hundred inhabitants, especially from the Breginj area, chose emigration to Italy rather than becoming citizens of a Communist state. With the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the Kobarid area became part of the independent Slovenian state. Politics The Municipality of Kobarid is governed by a mayor, elected by popular vote every four years, and a municipal council of 16 members. In both the local and the national elections, Kobarid tends to favor conservative parties, especially the Slovenian Democratic Party (which is the largest party in the municipal council).Kobarid.si However, in the mayoral elections, the voters have frequently supported independent candidates. The current mayor Darja Hauptmann is a member of the Slovenian Democratic Party.

Death According to the police, Macia had parked illegally, causing a traffic jam, and then resisted arrest. A preliminary post-mortem report released by South Africa's Independent Police Investigative Directorate indicated that Macia had died in police detention with head injuries and internal bleeding. He had been dragged behind a police van, after having been handcuffed to its rear, for about 500 metres.

It achieves higher compression than other DEFLATE/zlib implementations, but takes much longer to perform the compression. It was first released in February 2013 by Google as a free software programming library under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The name Z√∂pfli is the Swiss German diminutive of ‚ÄúZopf‚Äù, an unsweetened type of Hefezopf. Properties and use case Zopfli can output either a raw DEFLATE data stream or DEFLATE data encapsulated into gzip or zlib formats. It can be configured to do more or fewer iterations than the default 15 to trade processing time for compression efficiency. Under default settings, the output of Zopfli is typically 3‚Äì8% smaller than zlib's maximum compression, but takes around 80 times longer. The speed of decompressing Zopfli's output versus zlib's output is practically unaffected. Due to its significantly slower compression speed, zopfli is less suited for on-the-fly compression and is typically used for one-time compression of static content. This is typically true for web content that is served with DEFLATE-based HTTP compression or web content in a DEFLATE-based file format such as PNG or WOFF font files. Another use case is software updates or downloads with software package files that have a zip-based format such as Android application packages (APK) or Java Archives (JAR), especially over mobile connections. Technology The higher data density is achieved by using more exhaustive compression techniques. The method is based on iterating entropy modeling and a shortest path search algorithm to find a low bit cost path through the graph of all possible DEFLATE representations of the uncompressed data.  Implementations  A reference implementation from Google was released in the form of a programming library written in C. It is available as free software under the terms of version 2.0 of the Apache License. A wrapper was created for PHP: php_zopfli. An implementation of Zopfli in C# can be found as part of the CompressSharper library ZopfliDeflater.cs.  History  Zopfli is based on an algorithm from Jyrki Alakuijala. A reference implementation of zopfli was written by Google employees Jyrki Alakuijala and Lode Vandevenne. It was first released to the public in February 2013. Version 1.0.0 was released on April 25, 2013. After several adaptations of Zopfli for PNG compression appeared on GitHub, ZopfliPNG was committed to Google's zopfli reference implementation in May 2013.  PNG optimization  The Zopfli algorithm can be used to compress Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files because PNG uses a DEFLATE compression layer. There is a PNG optimization tool named ZopfliPNG from the authors of Zopfli. The Zopfli algorithm has also been integrated into other PNG compression optimization tools like advpng from the AdvanceCOMP utility suite, and OxiPNG.

Reed co-authored the young adult novel Amber House published in October 2012 and its sequel Neverwas, released internationally in January 2014. Early life Aisling Tucker Moore Reed was born in Los Gatos, California, Santa Clara County. She is the daughter of New York Times best-selling authors Kelly Moore and Dan Reed. Through her maternal grandfather, United States Naval Air Force Commander Lundi Addison Moore, she claims descent from Jamestown settler and Mayflower Compact signer Stephen Hopkins. She attended Ashland High School in Oregon. As a teenager, Reed gigged with an alternative rock band as a singer-songwriter, and performed lead roles in, as well as designed sets and costumes for, school and community theatre productions. She also served as a reporter, web designer and editor-in-chief for her high school's newspaper, The Rogue News. Reed went on to be recognized on the national level for her essays and short stories during her junior and senior years at Ashland High School. In 2009, at age 19, Reed persuaded her mother to collaborate on a novel. Reed‚Äôs sister Larkin was later included in the collaboration as well. In 2011, the trio negotiated and received a reported six-figure financial deal with the Arthur A. Levine imprint of Scholastic Press for the North American rights to their planned Amber House Trilogy. Reed attended the University of Southern California, where she studied broadcast journalism, theatre and cinema. She was a reporter and assistant editor for the university's student newspaper, the Daily Trojan, in 2010. Career Reed, along with her mother and younger sister Larkin, co-authored Amber House, the first installment of the Amber House trilogy, which was released by Scholastic's Arthur A. Levine Books imprint on October 1, 2012. Amber House received a positive critical reception, with Publishers Weekly praising the book's \\"intricate plot\\" and originality in a starred review, dubbing the story \\"rich, strange, and utterly fascinating.\\" Kirkus Reviews singled out the book's heroine as being a \\"strong, admirable character\\" for young female readers, specifically contrasting her with Bella Swan from the Twilight franchise. Amber House was a finalist for the 2014 Oregon Book Award for Young Adult Literature, and was selected for the Texas Library Association's 2014 TAYSHAS List. Reed acted as narrator of the audiobook edition of Amber House and its sequel Neverwas, which was released on January 7, 2014. Reed is also co-author of the series' forthcoming titles Ever Shall and Otherwhen. In early 2016, she worked as a reporter for The Grants Pass Daily Courier before quitting in the spring. Reed also played the lead role in unreleased independent horror movie titled ‚ÄúFrom the Dark,‚Äù under the stage name Wyn Reed.https://mailtribune.com/news/crime- courts-emergencies/southern-oregon-author-and-actress-pleads-guilty-to- manslaughter Self-identified survivor of gendered violence Reed first gained notoriety as an opponent of gendered violence (specifically sexual abuse against women) when she published the name of her alleged rapist to a blog. According to Reed‚Äôs own blog, in 2013 the USC Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards office deemed ‚Äúthe burden of proof was not reached to find that a violation of the Student Conduct Code occurred.‚Äù The case was later rejected by the LAPD, a private investigator, and the LA District Attorney. Reed was found liable of defamation in a counter-suit. Australian criminologist and feminist Anastasia Powell identified Reed in 2015 as one of several women who used the internet to engage in what would traditionally be deemed \\"vigilante\\" behavior in \\"resistance to rape culture\\" in Rape Justice: Beyond the Criminal Law. Alt URL In September 2013, Reed spoke out as a proponent of \\"mandatory exit surveys\\" at college campuses, designed to better monitor the efficacy of policies and programs regarding student safety. Such surveys would, according to Reed, prevent internal corruption and dismissal of valid student claims because they would create an external reference monitoring whether colleges remain in compliance with the Clery Act and their own safety policies. =Activism and self-advocacy= In 2013, Reed aided students at multiple institutions in filing Office for Civil Rights complaints against their colleges. In September 2013, Reed was recognized for her activism by the Veteran Feminists of America when she was awarded the Lucy Burns Challenger Award at the organization's 20th anniversary celebration. Reed received her honor alongside feminist icons such as attorney Gloria Allred, singer-songwriter June Millington and Grammy Award-winner Helen Reddy. Reed helped to organize college students in support of women's rights and to raise public awareness about the issue of gendered violence, appearing on CNN, CBS, NBC, HuffPost Live and other news programs. Reed founded the Student Coalition Against Rape (SCAR), originally a sub-org at the University of Southern California and now a national organization. Reed has stated her hope \\"that, ultimately, sexual aggression will become as socially unacceptable as smoking in a crowded room.\\" Since late 2012, Reed has blogged for xoJane.com and the Huffington Post, and written for Cosmopolitan magazine. =Murder and drug charges= On July 26, 2016, Reed was arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of her 63 year old maternal uncle, Shane Patrick Moore; this occurred at his parents' home in Applegate, Oregon . On July 29, 2016 Reed was indicted on charges of first and second degree manslaughter by a grand jury. Reed's bail was set at $200,000. When approached by the press, Reed's mother, Kelly Moore, said her daughter acted in self-defense against the uncle, who had been threatening Reed and members of the family and who was under specific court order to stay away from his niece after assaulting her in 2015.\\"Woman Pleads Not Guilty in Uncle's Homicide\\".

It stars an ensemble cast featuring Jason Bateman, Hope Davis, Frank Grillo, Michael Nyqvist, Paula Patton, Andrea Riseborough, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Max Thieriot, Colin Ford, and Jonah Bobo. The film explores how people experience the negative sides of modern communication technology by following three interconnecting stories. Plot Ambitious, up- and-coming reporter Nina Dunham interviews an underage video chat-room stripper named Kyle. Kyle, a runaway, works for a man named Harvey in a \\"house\\" with other chat-room strippers. However, after the interview achieves some prominence, the FBI demands that she reveal the address of the house so that they can shut down the operation. Since she has paid Kyle in order to make initial contact, she may have broken the law. As a result, police and her employer also put pressure on her to cooperate. Nina wants to save him from the business, yet fears losing his trust in the process. Kyle reluctantly gives her the address, but Harvey is tipped off and the entire household flees. Nina follows them to a motel where they're staying and asks Kyle to leave with her. Kyle is willing to do so at first, but when Nina is hesitant to guarantee him safe haven in her home, he refuses. Harvey watches them argue, then slaps Nina. The entire group of chat-room strippers leave and Nina drives away in tears. Two boys, Jason and his friend Frye, impersonate a girl named \\"Jessica Rhony\\" on Facebook Messenger and convince teenager Ben (the son of Rich, a lawyer for the TV station where Nina works) to send a nude picture of himself. The boys distribute it to classmates and the picture circulates to nearly everyone in their grade. Ben is so embarrassed by this cyber bullying that he attempts suicide by hanging himself and ends up in a coma. Rich doggedly searches Ben's social media, looking for answers, and begins chatting with \\"Jessica\\". Rich visits Ben in the hospital, where he meets Jason, who falsely calls himself Mike. Jason's father (who is actually named Mike) discovers what Jason and Frye have been doing and is furious. However, he protects his son by erasing the evidence on Frye's iPad. Later, Rich discovers the identity of \\"Jessica\\" and angrily goes to Mike's house, which results in a physical altercation. Jason tries to intervene and Rich hits him with a hockey stick. The fight ends when Mike hits Rich, who falls to the ground. A young married couple, Derek and Cindy, are still devastated due to a tragedy that occurred two years earlier: the death of their only son of SIDS. Cindy cannot stop mourning, and Derek cannot talk about their loss or deal with his feelings. One day, the couple finds their identities have been stolen online. They hire private detective Mike (Jason's father) to find the thief; after discovering that Cindy has been regularly chatting on a support group website, Mike determines who the identity thief is. Cindy and Derek go after the suspect, Stephen Schumacher, following him and even breaking into his home for evidence. Just before Derek plans to confront him at his front door, Mike calls to tell him that Schumacher is not their man, and that Schumacher too was a victim of the thief. Schumacher, who has noticed Cindy and Derek stalking him, confronts them in their car with a rifle; however, Derek, a former Marine, disarms him and forces him back into his house. Cindy is able to coax the gun away by explaining that Schumacher has been comforting her online. The film ends without any of the stories being resolved, yet all of the characters have stopped \\"disconnecting\\" and grown closer to the ones they love.

The critical consensus states \\"It's didactic in spots and melodramatic in others, but Disconnect strong cast helps make it a timely, effective exploration of modern society's technological overload.\\" The film also has a score of 64 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 24 critics indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and wrote \\"Even when the dramatic stakes are raised to the point of pounding music accompanying super-slow motion, potentially tragic violence, \\"Disconnect\\" struck a chord with me in a way few films have in recent years. I believed the lives of these people. I believed they'd do the drastic things they do in the face of crisis. I ached for them when things went terribly wrong and rooted for them when there were glimmers of hope. You should see this movie.

Sealo had trouble getting up and down the performance stage due to his weak legs. He would spend the time in which he was not performing on stage selling pitch cards. After performing, he preferred resting at hotels to sleeping at the fairground. He performed at the World Circus Sideshow in 1941. He also toured around the world and performed at many other freak shows. Sealo's freak show career lasted for thirty-five years; he retired in 1976 and moved to Showmen's Retirement Village in Gibsonton, Florida. He returned to his hometown of Pittsburgh afterwards when his health started to decline. He spent his final days at a Catholic hospital and died in 1980. Personal life Sealo was of Polish ancestry.

She was given her name not because her parents had wanted a boy but due to their Southern family name traditions. Her father was the organist for the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. She watched Howard Hughes film the miniature dogfights for the 1930 film Hell's Angels in a lot behind her childhood home. Lana Turner was her escort and gave her a campus tour when Day first enrolled at Hollywood High School. Orson Welles once hypnotized her in his magic act at the Hollywood Canteen. Career Day later attended and graduated from UCLA in 1944. She became a newspaper reporter for the Hollywood Citizen News, filing obituaries and writing reviews of plays.

The department's roles also include eradication of all kind of discrimination by sex, racial and ethnic origin, religion or ideology, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, disability or any other personal or social condition or circumstances. It existed from 2008 to 2010 when it merged with the Ministry of Health, and then from 2020.  History  The department was created in 2008 at the second term of Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's second term in order to promote equality policies set forth in the 2007 Equality Act and in the 2004 Comprehensive Act on Violence against Women, as well as promoting the programs of the Institute of Women and the Institute of Youth. The Ministry assumed the powers on equality that belonged at that time to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, which was renamed Ministry of Labour and Immigration. The Prime Minister chose Bibiana A√≠do to head this new department. She became the first person to hold this position in Spain and the youngest person to hold a ministerial office in democracy. On 21 October 2010, a cabinet reshuffle merged the Ministry of Equality in the Ministry of Health (which was headed by Leire Paj√≠n) and in exchange the Secretariat of State for Equality was created. A√≠do accepted the offer of the prime minister to continue at the forefront of the equality policies as Secretary of State. The department was reestablished on 13 January 2020.

Stilson is also known for her memoirs, musical talents, and personal appearances speaking across the United States. thumb Biography Stilson's father, Phil Stilson, is the president of a construction company, Most Wanted Drilling; her mother, Ruby Stilson, is an accountant and percussionist. Stilson's older siblings Julie Laub (a high school chemistry teacher) and Shane Stilson (a published author and mechanical engineer) were strong influences on the youth. The latter became an integral literary and social influence, always reading to Stilson and encouraging her to become a writer herself. Stilson attended Brighton High School. After graduating from high school two trimesters early, Stilson traveled to Hawaii and became a homeless violinist with Cade Morris, who plays the guitar. Months later they returned to Utah, married, and had children. It was during 2001‚Äì2003 that Stilson wrote her first memoir, The Golden Sky.A story about a mother's loss of a child. In 2001, her father was diagnosed with colon cancer. In 2003 her second child, a boy, died of birth defects after living 2¬Ω months, and her marriage started failing. In 2005, in an effort to cope with stressful situations, Stilson went back to school and received her associate degree from Western International University in 2007. Business Stilson worked as a food server, shelved at a local library, worked as an auto parts specialist and mechanic on big rigs, and modeled. It was during one particular modeling session that Stilson realized she had a knack for fashion design. While still attending the university, Stilson started her first two businesses, EC Boutique, a children's clothing company (2005‚Äì11) and Fifth Side Musical Performance (2005‚Äìpresent). In 2007, after graduating from Western International University, Stilson began working more diligently to make her former business EC Boutique a success. She sewed 1 to 3 outfits each day until she'd built up an inventory of over 500 unique children's sets. From 2008 ‚Äì 2011 EC Boutique was listed on eBay Pulse as a leading business in its industry. Stilson received numerous awards for her designs, but in her heart she longed to write. In 2011, despite past criticism from creative writing teachers in high school, Stilson closed her sewing business, and pursued her writing career. She started a blog called Crazy Life of a Writing Mom.A blog by EC Stilson. Instead of writing occasionally, she considered blogging a business endeavor and wrote every day for an entire year. She started with little-to-no followers, but gained over 24,000 social media followers by the end of 2011. In 2011 Stilson met Dee Ready, a well-known editor and bestselling author previously published through Crown, Janie Goltz, a former newspaper reporter and editor, Joshua Carstens, who'd just graduated with an MA in professional writing, Lexie Lane, a well-known mompreneur, and Fran Fischer, a retired American artist. It was from the support of these people that Stilson found the strength and knowledge to found Wayman Publishing. Since 2012, Stilson helped Wayman Publishing donate thousands of dollars from book sales to the Pregnancy Resource Center, Angel Watch‚Äîan infant loss bereavement organization‚Äîand the American Diabetes Association. In addition to this, Wayman's books received endorsements from authors, television producers, and politicians. Some of its most renowned book endorsers include Angela Santomero and Peter Greyson. Five of its books became Amazon bestsellers in 2012, many of them in large categories such as women's memoir.Women's Memoir category on Amazon Wayman Publishing went out of business in the fall of 2014.

Samurai Power Rangers The Samurai Power Rangers The Samurai Rangers are descendants of samurai who reside at the Shiba House, their base of operations and use the kanji-based power called Symbol Power, which is passed down from one generation to the next. Symbol Power allows them to turn thoughts into power and summon various objects. Once becoming a Ranger, they must stay clear of their friends and family to keep them safe from becoming a target of the Nighloks. The Shiba House is protected by special Defensive Symbols to keep the Rangers safe. They use a Gap Sensor to detect the presence of a Nighlok and its whereabouts. The Rangers all carry \\"Spin Swords\\" that can utilize Samurai Disks. When a disk is attached to it, the Spin Sword acts as a praxinoscope and it powers up depending on the disk itself. The Spin Swords can be transformed into each of the Rangers signature weapon. When the Rangers summon their Zords, each Spin Sword transforms into a \\"Mega Blade\\". In the Zords‚Äô cockpit, the Mega Rangers fold their Mega Blade and insert it and attach the standard Samurai Disk to the piloting system. The Gold Ranger has a personally unique weapon: The Barracuda Blade, which acts similar to the spins swords in the sense that it can also utilize Samurai disks. Because the Gold Ranger doesn't have his own Spin Sword, he instead sheaths his Barracuda Blade, sets it aside and summons a Mega Blade once he's summoned his Zords. Upon entering battle, the team morphs by calling \\"Go, Go Samurai!\\" and writing their respective Ranger symbol with their morphers: The Samuraizers. The Gold Ranger has a unique Morphing call and instead states \\"Samurai Morpher, Gold Power!\\" After morphing the whole group then states their motto \\"Rangers Together, Samurai Forever!\\". =Jayden Shiba= Jayden Shiba is a young man directly descended from the Shiba family. He was raised since childhood by Mentor Ji after his father gave him the Lion Folding Zord before his final battle. He is the substitute 18th leader of the Samurai Power Rangers. Jayden is generally calm and serious, though he considers others' feelings and is willing to do anything to help his friends. Jayden is always concerned for the other Rangers, even once attempted to leave and fight alone to put them out of risk and initially refused to allow Antonio to join them for the same reason. His excellent fighting skills make him the target of a mysterious half-Nighlok, half-human warrior named Deker, who wants to find a formidable opponent for his katana Uramasa. It is hinted several times that he is keeping a secret from the other Rangers, which often troubles him but he reminds himself it's for their safety. Being the only Ranger that can master a special sealing character that can seal away the leader of the Nighloks: Master Xandred, the other Rangers are very protective of him and are often willing to put themselves in harms way for his safety, which constantly troubles him. As the series progress he becomes more open with them and accepts the fact that they are a team. In a fight against Deker, Deker states that he has become weaker because he relies on his teammates now as opposed to fighting alone as he did previously. Mentor Ji assures him this is not true and that he brings honor to all the Red Rangers before him. Jayden's secret is finally revealed in the episode \\"Fight Fire with Fire.\\" Jayden was not the true Red Ranger but was rather standing in for his older sister Lauren, who was sent into hiding as a child to avoid being targeted by the Nighloks as she was the only one who could master the sealing symbol and not Jayden. After Lauren takes her place at the Shiba House as the true Red Ranger, Jayden decides to leave the Shiba House no longer having any purpose there much to the other Rangers dismay. After one final battle with Deker, the other Rangers convince him to return before the reawakening of Master Xandred. After Lauren's Sealing Symbol failed to forever seal away Master Xandred, she relinquishes leadership of the team back to Jayden. Alongside the other Samurai Rangers, Jayden uses Shogun mode to destroy Master Xandred, and then the Samurai Megazord to defeat him for good. After the final battle, Jayden stays at the Shiba house with Mentor Ji, finally learning to have fun now that his samurai duties are over, with Mentor Ji even giving him a new red colored guitar as a victory gift. He would later appear to provide assistance to the Power Rangers Super Megaforce, allowing them to make use of the Double Disc to battle an enemy. He and his teammates would then join the army of veteran Rangers who battle alongside the Megaforce Rangers against the Armada. As the Red Ranger, he is the Samurai of Fire and his personal weapon is the Fire Smasher, with the Bullzooka serving as his secondary weapon. The Fire Smasher can enter \\"Cannon Blast Mode\\" when used any auxiliary Zord disk. He pilots the Lion Folding Zord, the Tiger Zord, and the Bull Zord. The Lion Disk and the Lightning Disk allow him to use the moves \\"Blazing Strike\\" and \\"Lightning Fury\\" respectively. When both Disks are used in combination with two Spin Swords, Jayden can use the \\"Blazing Storm\\" attack. He can use the Black Box to access his Super Mode or the Shark Disk to access Shark Attack Mode. When piloting a zord he morphs into his Mega Mode form. He will morph into Super Mega Mode or Mega Shark Mode if he was in Super Mode or Shark Attack mode prior to morphing. Using the Shogun Buckle he can access Shogun Mode. Jayden Shiba is portrayed by Alex Heartman. As a child, he is portrayed by George Beca. =Kevin= Kevin is a young man who gave up his dream of swimming in the Olympics to become the Blue Samurai Ranger. Due to his strict upbringing, he is extremely enthusiastic and takes his Ranger duties very seriously. His fierce loyalty and enthusiasm brings much comic relief. He lives a very disciplined lifestyle and is never late due to his self-planned daily training schedule. Kevin is also the engineer behind many of the Samurai Combinations, having figured out how to combine the Samurai Battlewing with the Megazord. He was initially unreceptive towards Antonio, as he felt Antonio was not a true Samurai and was \\"just goofing around\\" but after seeing Antonio's dedication, he finally accepted him as a true Samurai. Kevin is the closest in terms of skill to Jayden. As such Kevin is typically the one to lead the other Rangers in Jayden's absence. He also appreciates Mike's creativity, however the Green Ranger's lazy nature tends to annoy him. Nevertheless, the two of them work well as a team. After the final battle, Kevin goes back to his swimming career, planning to train for the Olympic qualifying tournament. Like the other Rangers, he later appeared as part of the Ranger Army in Super Megaforce where they helped the Megaforce Rangers fight the Armada. As the Blue Ranger, he is the Samurai of Water and his personal weapon is the Hydro Bow. He pilots the Dragon Folding Zord and the Swordfish Zord. The Dragon Disk allows him to use his signature move \\"Dragon Splash\\". He can also use the Swordfish Disk with his Hydro Bow to fire a special healing mist. He can use the Black Box to access his Super Mode or the Shark Disk to access Shark Attack Mode. When piloting a zord he morphs into his Megamode form. He will morph into Super Mega Mode or Mega Shark Mode if he was in Super Mode or Shark Attack mode prior to morphing. Using the Shogun Buckle he can access Shogun Mode. Kevin is portrayed by Najee De-Tiege. =Mike= Mike is an avid video gamer and the lazy rebel of the group. He is very close friends with Kevin and Emily. Mike also wants to be as strong as Jayden and therefore sometimes trains rigorously to improve his skills. Being the slacker of the group, he is very irresponsible and once skipped out on training when he felt that he was not doing well to hang out with his old friends. He can also be somewhat cocky and tends to joke around, but he is kind and usually means well. While Mike is not as skilled as Jayden and Kevin, Mike is very crafty and tricky sometimes outwitting what would otherwise be a difficult enemy. His creativity is what allows him to defeat tough opponents. He often clashes with Kevin; however they are still the best of friends. He respects Kevin's stronger technique but will often deny it. Mentor Ji had trouble training him at first due to his lifestyle, but later they become more cooperative and Mike improves his Symbol Power, allowing him to access the powers of the Beetle Disk. Throughout the series it is hinted that Mike has feelings for Emily. This is confirmed when, by the final episode, they are now in a relationship and Mike plans to travel with her back to her home to care for her. In Super Megaforce, Mike is among the Rangers who assist the Megaforce Rangers in the final battle against the Warstar Armada. As the Green Ranger, he is the Samurai of the Forest and his personal weapon is the Forest Spear. He pilots the Bear Folding Zord and the Beetle Zord. The Bear Disk allows him to use his signature move \\"Forest Vortex\\". He can also use the Beetle Disk with his Forest Spear to extend its range and power. He can use the Black Box to access his Super Mode or the Shark Disk to access Shark Attack Mode. When piloting a zord he morphs into his Megamode form. He will morph into Super Mega Mode or Mega Shark Mode if he was in Super Mode or Shark Attack mode prior to morphing. Using the Shogun Buckle he can access Shogun Mode. Mike is portrayed by Hector David, Jr, who was one of the handful of veteran Ranger actors to appear in the Super Megaforce finale. =Emily= Emily is a country girl and the youngest member of the team who becomes the Yellow Samurai Ranger. She is close to her older sister Serena who had been training to be the Yellow Samurai Ranger. When Serena became ill, Emily stepped up to take her place. Emily is deeply respectful of Jayden and wants to help the team in any way she can. As a child Emily was severely bullied, and as a result she has rather low self-esteem, often putting herself down and saying she is clumsy and not fit to be a Ranger. Emily used an old saying \\"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me\\" to help her get through her childhood. She can also be seen playing a flute, due to her sister playing a flute to make her feel better every time someone picked on her. She idolizes Mia and strives to become more like her. As the series progresses, she becomes more confident and braver and no longer doubts herself or her abilities. It is occasionally implied that she reciprocates Mike's feelings for her. After the final battle, she goes back home to care for her sister, along with Mike, with whom she is now in a relationship. In Super Megaforce, Emily is among the Rangers who help the Megaforce Rangers in the final battle against the Warstar Armada. As the Yellow Ranger, she is the Samurai of Earth and her personal weapon is the Earth Splicer. She pilots the Ape Folding Zord. The Ape Disk allows her to use her signature move \\"Seismic Swing.\\" She can use the Black Box to access her Super Mode or the Shark Disk to access Shark Attack Mode. When piloting a zord she morphs into her Megamode form. She will morph into Super Mega Mode or Mega Shark Mode if she was in Super Mode or Shark Attack Mode prior to morphing. Using the Shogun Buckle she can access Shogun Mode. Emily is portrayed by Brittany Anne Pirtle, who later returned for the Super Megaforce finale as part of the veteran ranger army. As a child, she is portrayed by Lara Hodgson. =Mia Watanabe= Mia Watanabe is a strong-willed girl who acts as the big sister to the team. She loves children and worked at an orphanage prior to becoming the Pink Samurai Ranger. Though she is a terrible cook (none of the Rangers can stomach her cooking except for Lauren), Mia tries her best in order to achieve her dreams and she thinks her cooking is brilliant. Mia's maturity brings the team together and comforts any one of them that's feeling down. She also acts as an idol to Emily, who wants to be more like her. She is the second ranger to access Super Samurai mode and shogun mode after Jayden. It is later revealed that she has a younger brother named Terrence who she calls Terry for short, and also that she is a singer. She was somewhat sympathetic towards Dayu after she witnessed the tragic events that befell Dayu but then later develops a strong hatred of her after Dayu attacked Emily while Mia was trying to reason with her. After the final battle, Mia enrolls in a culinary academy, much to the others' relief. She would later join the Rangers in Super Megaforce who united to face the final attack of the Warstar Armada. As the Pink Ranger, she is the Samurai of Sky and her personal weapon is the Sky Fan. She pilots the Turtle Folding Zord. The Turtle Disk allows her to use her signature move \\"Airway.\\" She can use the Black Box to access her Super Mode or the Shark Disk to access Shark Attack Mode. When piloting a zord she morphs into her Megamode form. She will morph into Super Mega Mode or Mega Shark Mode if she was in Super Mode or Shark Attack Mode, prior to morphing. Using the Shogun Buckle, she can access Shogun Mode. Mia is portrayed by Erika Fong. =Antonio Garcia= Antonio Garcia is a fisherman and the tech wizard of the group. He happened to be a childhood friend of Jayden, training alongside him and receiving the Octozord from him and making a promise to aid him as a Samurai. He is considered to be Jayden's opposite, being hyperactive and expressive as Jayden is reserved and stoic. He is the only Ranger who is not of Samurai descent. With his technological skills he created his own Morpher out of a trashed cellphone and by reverse engineering the Octozord. He also developed a way to channel symbol power through texting on his Morpher which allowed him to communicate with the Octozord. He is a very skilled cook, primarily with sea food, and will regularly prepare meals for the team. He is also shown to be a very skilled singer and guitar player. When Antonio first appears he saves the other Rangers from the Nighlok Vulpes. In the subsequent episode he explains his past and his intent to join the team. However, Ji initially refuses to let Antonio join on the grounds that he lacks the proper training and discipline, and Jayden sides with this decision out of concern for Antonio's safety. However, when the Rangers are completely overpowered by the Nighlok Steeleto, they reconsider and allow Antonio to join. After joining the team he used his tech skills he to repair the Claw Zord and unlock both the Black Box and The Light Zord. After the final battle, Antonio goes on a global cruise ship fishing expedition. He would later appear in Super Megaforce alongside his teammates as part of an army who came to the aid of the Megaforce Rangers. As the Gold Ranger, he is the Samurai of Light and his personal weapon is the Barracuda Blade (a wakizashi that he uses in his high speed slash attacks, reminiscent of Iaido). The Barracuda Blade's special attack is the \\"Barracuda Bite\\", which slashes an enemy multiple times with energy strikes at incredible speeds. He pilots the Octo Zord and the Claw Zord. He also controls the Light Zord as his secondary weapon which can also be enlarged to fight alongside the Megazord. The Light Zord's Signature move is the \\"Scattershot.\\" The kanji on the LightZord's abdomen is \\"‰æç\\", which translates to \\"Samurai\\". Antonio returns in Super Ninja Steel. Antonio is portrayed by Steven Skyler. As a child, Antonio is portrayed by Connor Kerrigan. Voiced by Jeremy Birchall in the Clash of the Red Rangers: The Movie. =Lauren Shiba= Lauren Shiba is Jayden's older sister and the true 18th leader of the Samurai Power Rangers. As the head of the Shiba House, Lauren is the actual Ranger who can master the special Sealing Symbol, passed down from previous generations and thus has a much stronger fire power. Because of this, she stayed in hiding while Jayden took her place to draw the Nighloks attention away from her. When she finally masters the Sealing Symbol that can defeat Master Xandred, she returns to the team. However, she did not appear with the team when they joined the veteran Ranger army in Super Megaforce. She is kind and friendly to others, and a bit more open unlike Jayden. She cares deeply for her younger brother and was saddened by his departure from the team like the other Rangers. She is the only Ranger who enjoys Mia's cooking, much to the other Rangers' amazement. As the true Red Ranger, she possesses all the same weapons and powers as Jayden, and her fighting skills are greater than Jayden's and has greater fire Symbol Power than her brother. She pilots the Lion Folding Zord as well as all of Jayden's other Zords. Lauren uses the older version of the Samuraizer (originally her father's) which has a brush mode for writing Kanji as opposed to the modern versions which have LEDs instead. During the Shattered Grid storyline in Boom! Studios comics, when all of Ranger history was attacked by Lord Drakkon, an evil alternate version of Tommy Oliver, Lauren was the sole survivor of the Samurai Rangers, retreating into the past to join the original Power Rangers as they fought against Drakkon. In the process, she briefly formed a relationship with Jason Lee Scott, the original Red Ranger and leader of the forces arrayed against Drakkon, but this relationship was erased when Drakkon's final defeat undid his entire invasion. Lauren Shiba is portrayed by Kimberley Crossman. Lauren is the first-ever and only female red ranger in Power Rangers franchise history. She is also the third overall female leader (second in regular series) in the Power Rangers franchise. Allies=Mentor Ji= Mentor Ji is the Rangers' sensei who helps them in their samurai training and provides the team with information on their enemies. He raised Jayden from a young age and trained him to take arms as the Red Samurai Ranger. Like the rangers, he can use symbol power to perform various tasks. In Power Rangers Super Megaforce, he and Jayden later watch the Super Megaforce Rangers in their Megazords fighting Matacore. Mentor Ji portrayed by Rene Naufahu. =Bulk= Farkus \\"Bulk\\" Bulkmeier, a supporting character from the early years of the franchise, is once again portrayed by Paul Schrier. In his latest misadventure, Bulk becomes inspired by the newest Ranger team to appear and becomes determined to shape Spike, the son of his best friend Skull, into a great Samurai. Unfortunately for Spike, Bulk often deludes himself about his own abilities. =Spike Skullovitch = Spike Skullovitch (portrayed by Felix Ryan) is the son of Bulk's old friend Eugene \\"Skull\\" Skullovitch. He attempts to become a Samurai with Bulk's misguided help, often with failed results. He has a very snorty laugh and also a habit of laughing at inappropriate moments, such as Bulk getting hurt. He also has a crush on Mia the Pink Samurai Ranger and his most prized possession is a stuffed toy panda named Sammy. =Jayden's father= Jayden's father is the previous Red Ranger before Jayden. In his last few moments he's able to seal Master Xandred away, but the seal had not been perfected so it wasn't permanent. He gave Jayden the Lion Folding Zord. Portrayed by Steven A. Davis. Villains The villains of the season are the Nighloks, vicious demonic beings that reside in the Netherworld and need to bathe in the Sanzu River's waters once in a while or else they dry up. Their goal is to flood the Sanzu River with the sorrows of humans and into the crevice from the Netherworld to the Earth. =Master Xandred= Master Xandred is the Vai≈õrava·πáa/Japanese spiny lobster-themed leader of the Nighloks and is armed with a broadsword. The most powerful of the Nighlok, Xandred is prone to frequent violent outbursts, usually directed at the failure of his subordinates to destroy the Rangers. He seeks to cause the Sanzu River to flood with the despair of humans, allowing him to enter the world of the living and conquer it. His rage was originally endless until he heard the sound of Dayu's Harmonium. Master Xandred was sealed within the Netherworld years ago in a battle with the last team of Samurai Rangers led by Jayden's father, who perished after using his symbol power to imprison Xandred. Xandred possesses enormous strength and power, easily able to overpower the Samurai Rangers in their first encounter, and is proven to be a capable swordsman. Power energy radiates from his body that can sometimes incapacitate him but has also been shown to create new Moogers and Spitfangs. However he displays a number of fatal weakness as well. Because of the (incomplete) seal that the original Red Ranger placed on him, Xandred's power is not at its peak. Not only that but he constantly suffers from a headache that only Octoroo's sake- like medicine and the music from Dayu's harmonium are able to soothe. Like other Nighlok, Xandred's body dries out if he's not in the Netherworld, although he dries out much faster than any other Nighlok (whether or not this is a result of the seal on him, it is never stated) and it takes longer for the Sanzu River's polluted water to soak back into Xandred's body. In \\"The Master Returns,\\" Xandred gets even more angry than before after he is told by Octoroo of Serrator's betrayal. He plans to go to Earth through a gap. Though Octoroo advises him not to, Xandred makes his return to Earth planning to destroy Serrator along with the Samurai Rangers. Instantly Xandred starts to dry up, but he fights the Rangers anyway and completely overpowers them. Jayden goes to take him on with his Bullzooka, but Xandred manages to block all the shots. He is able to defeat Jayden even in Super Samurai Mode, leaving him badly hurt and unable to stand up. Afterwards, Xandred repairs and gives Dayu back her harmonium. Xandred is about to completely dry up when Octoroo brings him into the Netherworld to rejuvenate, sinking to the bottom of the Sanzu River. This ends up giving Serrator the opportunity to take over Xandred's ship and split world in two. In \\"Evil Reborn,\\" the result of Mia destroying Dayu's Harmonium is enough to raise the Sanzu River and fully heal Master Xandred as he appears on Earth to confront the Rangers. In \\"The Sealing Symbol,\\" Xandred states that with his power renewed, he is unstoppable. When Dayu is starting to succumb to her injuries, Xandred puts her out of his misery and assumes a stronger form. While Lauren writes the Sealing Symbol, the other Samurai Rangers fight Xandred to keep him from attacking Lauren. Xandred moves fast enough to knock the Rangers down as the Samurai Rangers work to keep Xandred from attacking Lauren. When Lauren writes the Sealing Symbol and fires it towards Xandred, it has no effect on Xandred as he emerges with a white patch that represented Dayu's human side that keeps him from drying out and immunizes the Sealing Symbol as well. Xandred attacks the Samurai Rangers as Jayden uses a teleportation symbol to get the Samurai Rangers away from Xandred. Xandred then takes a kimono that Dayu had dropped and retreats back to the Netherworld. After Octoroo holds a brief memorial for Dayu, Xandred states that she has served her purpose and that it is time to invade Earth. He begins the invasion on Earth by unleashing the waters of the Sanzu River upon the Earth. Xandred tells Octoroo that they have yet to defeat the Samurai Rangers. Xandred confronts the Rangers during their fight with an army of Moogers. Jayden plans to attack the white spot on Xandred that Dayu's humanity is on while the other Samurai Rangers fight the Moogers and the Spitfangs. Jayden uses his Super Spin Sword on the white patch but Xandred states that he can't be defeated that easily. Xandred then uses his Netherwind attack and the Flames of the Netherworld to take down the Rangers. Xandred is surprised the Rangers will not beg for mercy, even in defeat so he plans to go after Lauren expecting them to beg for her. In the final episode \\"Samurai Forever,\\" the Rangers chase him down and attack him with everything they have. Jayden then uses the Second Shiba Fire Disk as their trump card. Jayden finally destroys Xandred as the Red Shogun Ranger, but Xandred returned in the form of a Mega Monster. Xandred manages to repel the Beetlezord, Swordfishzord, Tigerzord, Octozord, Clawzord, Bullzord and the Samurai Shield until only the Samurai Megazord was left standing. The Rangers put all the symbol power they have left into one final strike which slashes Xandred in half. In his final moments before his destruction, Xandred brags to the Rangers that they may have beaten him, but the Nighloks will rise again one day. Voiced by Jeff Szusterman. =Dayu= Dayu (formerly known as Dahlia) is one of Master Xandred's two followers, a female Benzaiten/sea slug/Futakuchi- onna-themed figure with a shamisen. Before becoming a Nighlok, she was a human who was a newlywed to Deker. But a fire (implying to have been set up purposely by Serrator) burned their house down and injured Deker leaving him with moments left to live. A mysterious Nighlok appeared (later revealed to be Serrator) who offered Deker's life back in exchange for her humanity. When she accepted the deal, Deker indeed lived on but as half-human, half-Nighlok with no memory of Dayu. Dayu then became a Nighlok herself with only her shamisen (which was once her decorative lute) by her side to remind her of her past. Of all the villains, Dayu is the only one who cannot let go of her past once making an attempt to reclaim it by kidnapping brides and using their tears to create a wedding dress. Her plan failed due to the Rangers' interference, though she is saved by Deker. She is a powerful fighter as she took down both Kevin and Mia at once. Her shamisen (which she calls her \\"Harmonium\\") has a hidden short sword in the neck which she uses for battle. She has a habit throwing the baki of her instrument at Nighloks' she gets angry at. In \\"Broken Dreams,\\" Master Xandred was getting tired of Dayu's failure and breaks her shamisen causing her to go to the human world and fix it with a musician. Mia pursues Dayu only for them to be put under a sleeping spell by Rhinosnorus. Mia witnesses Dayu's past in a nightmare. After the sleeping spell wore off, Dayu attacked Mia (who wanted to help Dayu after what she saw) only to retreat when Emily arrived. In \\"The Ultimate Duel,\\" Dayu meets with Deker before his duel with Jayden. Around the time when the Black Box was completed as seen in \\"Super Samurai,\\" Dayu abandons Master Xandred and Octoroo and goes into the human world. In \\"Trading Places,\\" Dayu meets with an outcast Furry Wart on a river stream where she plans to find a way to end Master Xandred's life for casting her out and breaking her harmonium. In \\"Kevin's Choice,\\" Dayu finds the part of Deker's sword and is approached by Serrator who offers to fix Dayu's harmonium in exchange for the info on where Deker is. While the two talked, it was revealed Serrator was the one who turned Deker into a half- human/half-Nighlok. Dayu is wondering if Serrator is lying until she finds Deker in the forest. Dayu learns from Deker that his sword Uramasa had taken the blow in the fight against Jayden. She and Deker crash the battle between the Power Rangers and Skarf where they attack Skarf in order to unleash Skarf's true power. In \\"A Sticky Situation,\\" Dayu receives a special dagger from Serrator. In \\"The Master Returns,\\" Dayu states her unhappiness with how long Serrator is taking to fix her Harmonium. Soon after Serrator heads to a cliff, Dayu senses her Harmonium presence and heads after Serrator. After she manages to catch up with Serrator, she fights him only to be knocked down by Serrator. After Master Xandred returns to Earth, he fixes Dayu's Harmonium and Dayu swears her loyalty once again to Master Xandred. In \\"A Stroke of Fate,\\" Dayu tries to convince Deker not to trust Serrator and Antonio begs him to reconsider his role in the battle between Humans and Nighloks following him remembering his past memories. Yet Dayu was unable to convince Deker to not trust Serrator. In \\"Fight Fire with Fire,\\" Dayu returns to Master Xandred's ship and speaks with Octoroo a plan to ambush the Power Ranger. Dayu and Octoroo send Fiera to help take down the Red Ranger. Dayu and Octoroo were surprised that the Fire Flashers didn't fully consume Jayden and suspect that Jayden isn't the head of the Shiba Clan. In \\"Evil Reborn,\\" Dayu senses the fight between Deker and Jayden. Dayu then senses that Deker is gone as Octoroo tells her to play her Harmonium to help recharge Master Xandred. Dayu declares that her Nighlok fate is sealed and that she has nothing left to lose as she unleashes the Moogers and some giant Moogers on the marina. Dayu then plays the Harmonium as Mia confronts her. Mia ends up slashing Dayu and her Harmonium where the Harmonium's destruction ends up unleashing a lot of misery which is enough to restore Master Xandred. Dayu then tells Master Xandred that she always pays her debts. In \\"The Sealing Symbol,\\" an injured Dayu collapses on Master Xandred stating that she played it for Deker and that it was the end of her sadness. Dayu stated that she wasn't truly a Nighlok. Master Xandred puts Dayu out of her misery as he absorbs Dayu's human half to serve as his defense against the Sealing Symbol and keep him from drying out. All left of her was her kimono, which is thrown to the Sanzu River by Master Xandred. Dayu was presumably reunited with Deker in the afterlife. Dayu is voiced by Kate Elliott in Nighlok form and Dahlia is portrayed by Rugen Du Bray. =Octoroo= Octoroo is an elderly Fukurokuju/squid-themed figure with a staff who is one of Master Xandred's two followers. He is usually reading old books, mixing Master Xandred's medicine, or checking the water level of the river. Everyone, including Master Xandred, calls him \\"Noodle-Face.\\" Despite his small form, he is powerful enough to take on the Gold Ranger. He also seems to be highly skilled in black magic and a gifted potioneer, as he is easily able to poison the Red Ranger singlehandedly. Like Dayu and Serrator, he seems to be able to stay in the human world indefinitely without drying out. Octoroo usually begins his sentences with the exclamation \\"Ooh ah ooh!\\" and he has a habit of speaking in rhyme. Octoroo is often teased by his peers for his unusual appearance and the dislike seems to be mutual as he has shown annoyance toward the Nighlok monsters and is distrustful of Deker. The only exceptions being Master Xandred, whom he is very loyal to, and Dayu, whom Octoroo seems to care about and actually admits being saddened by her passing. In \\"Fight Fire with Fire,\\" Dayu and Octoroo send Fiera to help take down the Red Ranger and Octoroo give her Fire Flashers in order to fight fire with fire. Dayu and Octoroo were surprised that the Fire Flashers didn't fully consume Jayden and suspect that Jayden isn't the true head of the Shiba Clan. In the episode \\"The Great Duel\\" Octoroo gave half of his life source to Gigertox to prepare him for battle. In \\"Samurai Forever\\", Octoroo is seen on Xandred's ship as it sinks into the Sanzu River following Xandred's destruction. Voiced by Jeff Szusterman. =Deker= Deker is a mysterious Sh≈çj≈ç-themed Nighlok swordsman who doesn't remember his past and is cursed into finding the ideal opponent to duel. He is armed with the katana Uramasa and called by Xandred as the Cursed Warrior due to being half-human. Deker was once married to Dayu before becoming half-human. As a human, he was a samurai and was given the blade Uramasa by Dayu. But when a house fire almost kills him, Dayu surrendered her humanity to Serrator to revive him. However this erased his memory and turned him half-human half-Nighlok cursed to forever wander with a thirst for battle. Due to being a half-human, Deker has the ability to assume human form and transverse between the Netherworld and the land of the living without relying on the Sanzu River for survival. He considers the Red Ranger to be his greatest challenge since Uramasa's blade became radiant. In \\"Boxed In,\\" Deker claims that the Ultimate Duel might free him from his Nighlok half. Deker is able to remember his past as Dayu's husband. In \\"The Ultimate Duel,\\" Deker duels with Jayden while the others fought Rhinosnorus. Eventually, Jayden allows Deker to injure him allowing him to get close enough to finish Deker off. Deker's sword Uramasa is broken and half of it gets struck into the ground nearby. Deker thanks Jayden for the Ultimate Duel before vanishing in a puff of smoke while falling off the cliff. In \\"Kevin's Choice\\", Dayu finds a piece of Uramasa as Serrator arrives to prevent Dayu from throwing the broken part away. Dayu later finds Deker alive in the forest. Deker tells Dayu that Uramasa took the damage for him as she tells him about Serrator's offer. With a backup sword, Deker joins Dayu into attacking the Rangers where Deker fights Jayden stating that he is now a \\"sword for hire\\" ever since Uramasa broke. Deker and Dayu then attack Skarf in order to unleash Skarf's true power. In \\"Trust Me\\", Deker accompanies Serrator and Dayu to Monalua, where they use a special ash to make its inhabitants paranoid. Deker fights Jayden and Mia, where Deker defeats them and states that Jayden has become weaker for relying on his teammates to help him than fighting him solo. Following Malden's destruction, Jayden uses his Bullzooka when confronted by Deker who asks if Jayden has stated fighting with blasters now. After Jayden destroys the fires spreading the ash and lifting the paranoia spell, Deker was prepared to fight Jayden only for Serrator to tell him that he has bigger plans for him. Deker than leaves with Serrator and Dayu as Serrator summons a Papyrox and two giant Spitfangs to cover their escape. In the episode \\"A Crack in the World\\", Serrator refuses to give back Uramasa straight away. Serrator reveals his plans to Deker and promises him he will be free of his curse if he helps him. In the following episode \\"A Stroke of Fate,\\" Deker returns to the ruins of his home as he begins to remember some of his past memories. Dayu tries to convince him not to trust Serrator and Antonio begs him to reconsider his role in the battle between Humans and Nighloks, to no avail. Once Deker reobtains Uramasa, he betrays Serrator and strikes him down, leaving the Rangers to finish him off for good. In \\"The Great Duel,\\" Deker challenges Jayden to the Ultimate Duel once more after Jayden leaves the Shiba House. In \\"Evil Reborn,\\" Deker and Jayden duel on horseback as Jadyen successfully defeats Deker. With both combatants weakened, Deker rises and finds himself too tired to lift Uramasa. Deker then starts hallucinating where he sees Dayu in human form, telling him that she doesn't want to lose him again. Deker then charges towards Jayden only for Deker to be taken down by Kevin. Before disintegrating, Deker declares himself free. It is presumed that he and Dayu were reunited in the afterlife. Deker is portrayed by Ricardo Medina, Jr. (as Rick Medina). =Serrator= Serrator is an Ebisu/shachihoko-themed Nighlok with six slitted eyes and a ricus grin. He can teleport, emit electricity, elongate his claw, and wields a weaponized Shaku in combat. In \\"The Tengen Gate,\\" he was referred to as the Nighlok King. He was responsible for cursing Deker by turning him into a human/Nighlok hybrid and turning Dayu into a Nighlok as seen in \\"Broken Dreams\\" where his shadowed astral appearance appeared before Dayu's human form agreeing to save Deker's life in exchange for Dayu's humanity. Serrator officially debuted in \\"Something Fishy\\" where he had been at the bottom of the Sanzu River and was revived by Master Xandred's recent power surge. He arrives aboard Master Xandred's ship to offer his services and revealing himself to be the one who sent Switchbeast. He shows off his heightened powers by obliterating an army of Moogers with a single blast and manages to convince a skeptical Master Xandred of his loyalty and asks for permission to enter the human world to scare enough humans to flood the river. Once on Earth, he introduces himself to the Rangers, and during their battle seems to have the Rangers beat, with all of the weapons they wielded unable to affect him. Serrator even cuts a piece of paper into a shape and creates Papyrox from it. In the nick of time, Antonio arrives and manages to use the Lightzord to successfully damage Serrator. Serrator then leaves commenting that the Rangers had \\"passed the test\\" for now. In the episode \\"He Ain't Heavy Metal, He's My Brother,\\" Octoroo criticizes Serrator for failing. Briefly after this, Serrator goes to attack the city again only to be met by the Rangers. He overpowers the Rangers again. Just as he is about to finish them off, Mia arrives only to be knocked down by Serrator. Jayden then passes Mia the Black Box allowing her to go into Super Samurai Mode. She manages to damage Serrator using her Super Airway Finisher. Before retreating, Serrator creates another Papyrox which is accompanied by some Giant Moogers and two Giant Spitfangs. In the episode \\"Kevin's Choice,\\" Serrator appears before Dayu to prevent here from disposing the half of Uramasa that was broken during Jayden and Deker's battle. Serrator then makes a deal with Dayu, offering to fix her Harmounium and Uramasa as long as she help him. It was revealed Serrator was the one who turned Deker into a half- human/half-Nighlok. He has Dayu send the message to Deker who Dayu had no idea was still alive. He instructs Dayu and Deker to crash the battle between the Rangers and Skarf and unleash Skarf's true power. In \\"A Sticky Situation,\\" Serrator catches up to Deker and Dayu as Deker asks about him fixing Uramasa. Serrator gives Dayu a special dagger and tells Deker that he will play a part in mankind's destruction. In \\"The Master Returns,\\" Master Xandred learns of Serrator's secret plans and goes to Earth to deal with him. When Serrator is taking too long to get back to Dayu on repairing her Harmonium, she ends up confronting him which leads to an altercation where Serrator defeats Dayu. Luckily for Dayu, Master Xandred arrives and repairs Dayu's Harmonium upon reclaiming it from Serrator who flees. When Master Xandred is placed in the depths of the Sanzu River to recuperate, Serrator takes over his ship with no opposition. Serrator's plan is finally revealed in the episode \\"A Crack in The World\\" where Kevin notices how all his attacks form a straight line on the map. Serrator reveals during his next attack his true motives are to crack open the Earth so that the entire Sanzu River floods in, trapping Master Xandred in the Nether Worlds and heightening Serrators power to the point where he is equal to none. This will allow him to become the ruler of both worlds as well as create a new domain of his own. To finally complete the spell starting in \\"A Crack in the World,\\" he needed Deker to break the final point with his sword Uramasa. Serrator claimed that in doing so, Deker would also be free from his curse. In \\"A Stroke of Fate,\\" Serrator then plans to have Deker claim his prize in order for him to rip open the Earth. Serrator fights with Jayden, Mia, and Emily until Deker appears and Serrator gives Deker Uramasa in order to slash the barrier so that Deker can be free. Serrator is then betrayed by Deker at the last minute where he slashes Uramasa as Deker only worked with Serrator to get Uramasa fixed. Knowing his plans are ruined after the holes to the Netherworld close up, Serrator goes into an enraged fury before battling the Rangers once more. After taking a hit from the Bullzooka and the Cannon Strike attack, they defeat Serrator. Serrator then grows as the Rangers summon the Megazords. The Bull Megazord and the Light Megazord fights with Serrator while the Samurai Megazord and the Claw Armor Megazord to fight the two Papyrox. After the two Papyrox were destroyed by the Samurai Megazord and the Claw Armor Megazord, they help the Bull Megazord by combining the Zords into the Samurai Gigazord to fight Serrator and managed to strike him. The Gigazord uses the Shogun Strike on Serrator which he catches. Jayden then summons the Shark Zord which combines with the Samurai Gigazord. The Samurai Gigazord then uses the Ultimate Samurai Slash on Serrator. Before he succumbs to his injuries, Serrator exclaims that he was supposed to split open their world, not get split in half himself. Voiced by Derek Judge. =Professor Cog= Professor Cog is a cog-themed robot with a wrench for a right arm and a screwdriver for a left arm who comes from the alternate future of Power Rangers RPM. He can attack with Electro-Turbines and Hypno-Bolts. He and an army of Grinders escaped to the Samurai Rangers' reality to seek help from Master Xandred in order to level up and collect some of the water of the Sanzu River for his boss Venjix. He says that he will help them in exchange for taking down the Samurai Rangers. With this plan, Professor Cog plans to wipe out the last people in his reality by poisoning them with the Sanzu water. RPM Ranger Scott Truman followed Professor Cog to the Samurai Rangers' reality. When Professor Cog attacks Scott, the Samurai Rangers joined the fight. Professor Cog then sends the other Samurai Rangers into a vortex leading to Professor Cog's reality while Professor Cog's Hypno- Bolts start to kick in on both Red Rangers causing them to fight. When the Hypno-Bolts kick in, Professor Cog and Sergeant Tread watch Jayden and Scott duel each other. After the effects of the Hypno-Bolts were negated thanks to Mentor giving them a special seal, Jayden and Scott then fought Professor Cog, who sends Sergeant Tread to attack. After knocking down Sergeant Tread, Jayden and Scott fight Professor Cog until the other Rangers returned. With help from the other Samurai Rangers, Scott Truman and Jayden managed to destroy Professor Cog and Sergeant Tread. In the Super Megaforce season, a rebuilt Professor Cog appears (with his arms now flipped) and tricks the Megaforce Rangers into going to the RPM universe's Cornith for the Falcon Zord, while he leads his Grinders to their universe's version of earth to conquer it. Unfortunately, Professor Cog meets resistance from Prince Vekar's Armada, who are also trying to conquer earth, before being destroyed again by the Megaforce Rangers. Professor Cog is voiced by Cameron Rhodes. =Furry Warts= The Furry Warts are a yellow furred ball-like soot settling in roof of Xandred's Junk.

The Papyrox are considered to be stronger than the Moogers and the Spitfangs. Some versions of the Papyrox wield double-bladed swords. =Nighlok Monsters= The Nighlok Monsters are Y≈çkai-like monsters used by the villains to attack the Human World. They are dependent on waters from the Sanzu River for survival, therefore needing the negative emotions of humans to keep it from drying out.

Munch painted multiple variant versions of the expressionist work in oil on canvas during the period 1891‚Äì1893. The painting depicts a man with his head resting in his hand in a pensive mood at the edge of a shoreline. The inspiration for the painting was an unhappy romantic affair that Munch's friend, Jappe Nilssen, was involved in. In Munch's painting the figure of the melancholy man is at the right, and his mood is represented by the undulating shoreline and skylines that extend toward the left. Critics suggest that there are also erotic allusions, perhaps in the presence of the Moon reflected on the water.

Formerly named Wang Towers, it is a local landmark, dominating the busy intersection of Interstate 495 (the Boston outer ring road) and U.S. Route 3. It is the third-tallest building in Lowell, after Three River Place and the Kenneth R. Fox Student Union at UMass Lowell. The complex, consisting of three interconnected cement- clad 12-storey towers and other buildings totaling over situated on , was built by original sole tenant Wang Laboratories as its new world headquarters. Construction began in 1980, and it was completed in stages at a cost of (about $ in current dollars). The buildings served as a demonstration of the rise of Wang Labs and the Boston-area computer technology industry generally, and later as a sign of the rapid fall of the company and industry: Wang Labs entered bankruptcy in 1992, and the property was sold at bankruptcy auction in 1994 for a tiny fraction of its construction cost ‚Äì $525,000 (about $ in current dollars) ‚Äì in 1994, to Louis Pellegrine, fronting for Atlantic Retail Partners. Atlantic renovated the towers (with the help of tax breaks and a $4 million letter of credit from the City of Lowell) and sold them in 1998 to San-Francisco-based Yale Properties USA and Blackstone Real Estate Advisors, reportedly for over $100 million. The towers acquired new tenants, but business was hurt by the 2000-2001 bursting of the \\"dot-com bubble\\", and it was described as being, by 2005, a \\"ghost town\\" with an occupancy rate of about 50%. Yale Properties bought out Blackstone's share in 2005; in the same year San-Diego-based Divco West Properties bought an interest in the property. By 2007 the occupancy rate was back up to about 90%, with major tenants such as Motorola moving in. Yale actively shopped the property, but a 2007 deal to sell it for about $180 million to a consortium led by Davis Marcus Partners fell through. The real estate crash beginning in 2007 put severe strain on the property's finances, but Yale and Divco West (along with Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board) retained ownership. In 2012 the towers were about 70% filled and Colliers International was hired to boost occupancy. The towers were sold to CP Associates LLC for $100 Million in 2014.

He is a member of the Thandikkal Kodankandath family, Manaloor, Trichur, Kerala. Work series The Art of Happiness was inaugurated by the Dalai Lama at Cochin, Kerala on 25 November 2012. Having evolved over more than two years, the series is a combination of paintings and sculptures portraying the pain, suffering, and aspirations of the Tibetan community spread across the world in exile. These paintings also symbolize the compassion of the Tibetan people towards their motherland as well as their expectation that one day they will be able to return to a free land that they would be able to call their own. They also represent the agony of all downtrodden communities living in every part of the world. A significant aspect of this series is that the background colors change consistently with the seven notes of music. The basic colors used are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, the colors of the rainbow. The sculptures are placed over the background, giving the motifs and the core ideas of the paintings as butterflies, flowers, spiders, and elephants. The metallic sculptures used in the series evolved out of the thought process of Sherly Joseph Chalissery, wife of Kodankandath. Restoration Within was the National Academy Award-winning painting in 2003‚Äì2004. A restoration of a painting is the subject of this artwork in which the restoration of a cathedral is being examined by the artist. This work is considered a first-time experiment in the history of contemporary art in which the intricacies of restoration of a colossal structure has been utilized as a subject by the creator. First Supper won the 1993 Kerala State Award by the Lalita Kala Academy. The peculiarity of this painting is that it looks like a jigsaw puzzle in which the communication takes place when the viewer takes the effort to place the equally important pieces of colors in the perfect perspective. Decoding Da Vinci‚ÄîSelected by 'Swarnarekha' (Exhibition of National & Triennial Awardees, Lalit Kala Academy, New Delhi). The original idea of Leonardo da Vinci in his iconic work The Last Supper was to convey the establishment of Holy Mass geometrically. This was misinterpreted by author Dan Brown in his book The Da Vinci Code as he put forth the notion of a lady in the painting. Through a series of paintings titled Decoding Da Vinci that was conceived in a research spanning a period of 13 years, the painter reinvented the original concept of da Vinci. This painting was appreciated by the Catholic Church and Cardinal Paul Paupard, a former cultural minister of Pope John Paul II during a visit to the Pilar Seminary in Goa, India.

It is a legacy of the time prior to 1488 when parliamentary and judicial business was conducted in French, the language of the educated classes dating to the Norman Conquest of 1066. It is one of a small number of Norman French phrases that continue to be used in the course of parliamentary procedure. Variations of the English and modern French translations of the phrase are also used in the royal assent ceremony used in the Canadian Parliament. Norman French is not used.  Usage  The phrase is used to signify that the monarch has granted his or her royal assent to a bill in order to make it become law. It is used by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the House of Lords. It is only used after the Lord Chancellor, accompanied by the Lords Commissioners, has read out the letters patent for the bill. The Clerk of the Crown then reads out the short title of the bill and the Clerk of the Parliaments responds by saying the phrase towards the House of Commons at the bar of the House for each bill. The phrase is also written on the paper of the bill to show that the monarch granted royal assent to the bill. Should royal assent be refused, the expression ', \\"The Queen/King will be advised\\" (i.e., will take the bill under advisement), a paraphrase of the Law Latin euphemism '/' (\\"The Queen/King will consider [the matter]\\"), would be used, though no British monarch has denied royal assent since Queen Anne withheld it from the Scottish Militia Bill in 1708.Erskine May, pp. 372‚Äì3 For a supply bill, an alternative phrase is used; / (\\"The Queen/King thanks her/his good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so\\"). For a personal bill (e.g. Handel's Naturalisation Act 1727), the phrase ' (\\"Let it be done as it is desired\\") is used.  History  The practice of giving royal assent originated in the early days of Parliament to signify that the king intended for something to be made law. Norman French came to be used as the standard language of the educated classes and of the law, though Latin continued to be used alongside it. The work of the Parliament of England was conducted entirely in French until the latter part of Edward III's reign (1327‚Äì1377) and English was only rarely used before the reign of Henry VI (1422‚Äì1461, 1470‚Äì1471). Royal assent was occasionally given in English, though more usually in French. The practice of recording parliamentary statutes in French or Latin ceased by 1488 and statutes have been published in English ever since. The phrase Le Roy le veult was also used in the Parliament of Ireland (13th century ‚Äì 1800). During the period of the Protectorate, when the Lord Protector (Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard Cromwell) governed the country, assent was given in English. The old practice of giving assent in Norman French was resumed following the English Restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since. There has only been one attempt to abolish it, when the House of Lords passed a bill in 1706 \\"for abolishing the use of the French tongue in all proceedings in Parliament and courts of justice\\". The bill failed to pass the House of Commons. Although the use of French in courts was abolished in 1731, Parliamentary practice was unaffected.

He was known for winning many large verdicts for plaintiffs in civil litigation, including the first in a thalidomide case.Valerie J. Nelson, Obituary, James Butler, 84; Groundbreaking Lawyer, Activist, Art Collector, Los Angeles Times, June 4, 2005. Butler was also known as a civil rights leader and an art collector. \\"Known for his colorful and charismatic courtroom presence, Butler once told a jury in a pharmaceuticals case, 'If you do justice, you'll sock it to 'em. Early life, education, and military service Butler was born on September 26, 1920, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. His father, a postman, worked on a railway mail car. Butler received his bachelor's degree from Saint Peter's College in Jersey City. In 1943, he enlisted in the Marine Corps, and served in the Pacific Theater of World War II as a fighter plane pilot. Butler received the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, three Gold Stars and five citations for bravery. During World War II, Butler became ill with malaria and was treated by a Marine nurse, Master Sergeant Eugenia Louise Jefferson. They married in 1945. Butler attended Georgetown University Law Center and graduated in 1947. Career As an attorney, Butler became known for his defective drugs products liability work. In 1971, he won a $2.75 million jury verdict against Richardson-Merrell, the company that tested thalidomide, which caused birth defects. The judgment was later reduced to $500,000. After the first case, Butler went on to serve as plaintiffs' counsel in about 20 more thalidomide cases. Other notable cases in which Butler was counsel including litigation over Turkish Airlines Flight 981 (which crashed in Paris in 1974) and Pan Am Flight 73 (which was hijacked in Karachi, Pakistan). Butler was a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates. Butler was also known for his involvement in the civil rights movement. As a 35-year-old city attorney in 1955, Butler became the first vice president of the Compton NAACP. According to unofficial Compton NAACP historian Maxcy Filer, \\"The City Council even asked Jim Butler, 'What can we do about this NAACP?' Jim said, 'You accept it .... In fact, here's my membership card.' They all kind of kept quiet for about five minutes.\\" In retaliation for Butler's involvement with the NAACP, the City Council attempted a recall effort, which narrowly failed. Butler remained involved with the Compton NAACP until 1958, when moved to the Hancock Park neighborhood, to a home originally built for Bernard Baruch. Butler lived in the home until he died in 2005. Butler died in his sleep of cancer at his home on May 26, 2005, at age 84.James G. Butler, Inner Circle of Advocates. Personal life Butler was an art collector and had a collection featuring several notable works, including that of James Lee Byars. His law offices on Wilshire Boulevard featured eight Andy Warhol lithographs of Marilyn Monroe and other significant works. Butler's daughter, Eugenia P. Butler, also became an artist, and her work was exhibited by the Otis College of Art and Design in 2003. Butler married twice. His first marriage to art gallerist Eugenia Butler ended in 1970. His second marriage was to artist Morgan Thomas and lasted from late 1970s to 1989. He was survived by nine children and four grandchildren. According to the Los Angeles Times, Butler and his wife \\"raised their children to become political activists and were known for having an open house with a guest list that included members of the Black Panther Party,\\" holding parties with friends from the art world and loud Caribbean music. On one occasion, a neighbor who led the John Birch Society in Southern California, circulated a petition asking the family to sell the house, and Eugenia, the eldest of Butler's children, sent her brother Justin to \\"tell them we are selling the house to the Black Panthers.\\" Butler was a collector of dictionaries.

Caught up in the confused fighting east of that city, it fought in 13th Army under both 44th and 2nd Rifle Corps. In August it was reassigned to 20th Army of Western Front, and on the 15th it reported the following strength figures: 695 officers; 787 NCOs; 5,306 men plus 400 replacements just received; 5,464 rifles; 32 SMGs; 20 HMGs; 74 LMGs; 1 AAMG; 12 76mm guns; and no antitank guns, howitzers or mortars. The division distinguished itself in the Battle of Smolensk for its stubborn defensive fighting and local counterattacks, and it was withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command in September. On Sept. 18, in recognition of its earlier distinctions and its success in the Yelnya Offensive, the 161st became the fourth of the original four rifle divisions raised to the status of Guards on that date.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p 80 2nd Formation A new 161st Rifle Division formed from Apr. 16 to July 2, 1942, based on a cadre from 13th Rifle Brigade in the Moscow Military District.Walter S.

On July 10 this army became the 2nd formation of the 60th Army and joined Voronezh Front. In August the 161st was moved to 38th Army in the same Front, and on Dec. 18 became part of 18th (Separate) Rifle Corps, which in Feb. 1943 formed the basis for the 69th Army, but within a month the division was moved to 40th Army.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, Nafziger, 1996, pp 64-65 During these months the division was participating in the winter counteroffensive that partly surrounded and destroyed German 2nd Army, and as this ground to a halt in the spring it found itself well into what became known as the Kursk salient. In preparation for the Battle of Kursk, 40th Army was in the first echelon of the Voronezh Front defenses, but west of 6th Guards Army, which took the brunt of the German assault, and therefore saw little action. In August the division became part of 47th Rifle Corps.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p 65 During the Battle of the Dniepr, on Sept. 23, the 161st forced a crossing of the river at Zarubentsy,John Prados, Kanev: Parachutes Across the Dnepr, People's War Games, Oakland, CA, 1981, p 4 and map becoming part of the Bukrin Bridgehead, and 32 men were awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union. At the end of 1943 the division was moved to 18th Army, still in the same (now renamed 1st Ukrainian) Front, and in April, 1944, was once again moved to that front's 38th Army. Just before the Lvov‚ÄìSandomierz Offensive in July the 161st became part of 1st Guards Army, and it was here that it won the honorific \\"Stanislavskihk\\" for liberating the Polish town of Stanislav during that operation. In August, 1st Guards Army was reassigned to 4th Ukrainian Front, and apart from a few weeks back again in 18th Army, the division served in that army and that front for the duration as part of 107th Rifle Corps.

The series achieved good viewing figures, with the first episode gathering 5.53 million, 4.83 million tuning in for the second episode and 5.18 million for the final episode.http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly- top-30/ Notably, the series has never been released on DVD. Critical reception Sam Wollaston of The Guardian said of the first episode; \\"There's a nagging little bell going off in my head during the first of three episodes of The Ice Cream Girls. And it's getting louder. Someone leaves prison; there's the whiff of a miscarriage of justice; a family moves to the seaside, by Volvo, for a fresh start; then FLASHBACK! ‚Äì bad shit happened in the past; now it's time for it to catch up. Got it! The Poison Tree, which aired just a few months ago on the same channel. They love the old prison-Volvo-to-the- coast-flashback-novel psychological-thriller adaptation at ITV. That's not to say there's not plenty of intrigue here. Serena (Lorraine Burroughs) returns to her childhood town with her new family, to a dying mother and to terrible memories. Of a rape, a murder, and another girl, Poppy (Jodhi May), who was convicted of murder ‚Äì of a teacher who abused them both ‚Äì but may not have done it. But, and it shares this with The Poison Tree, too, there's an obviousness to it. An ITV drama-ness about it. It's so consciously trying to be a psychological thriller, not just your bog-standard thriller. Brows are knitted to mournful cellos, Poppy shouts from a motorway bridge, and there's a lot of staring out to sea, which inevitably brings on further flashbacks. These are triggered by almost anything: photos, newspaper cuttings, the beach hut, a particular street. At one point Serena, driving in the Volvo with her husband, even overtakes her younger self. Maybe they should have given her a lift. \\"Hop in, love ‚Äì oh, I'm you, by the way, in the future. I wouldn't go in there, incidentally, it's trouble.\\" I also thought Evan, the husband, was a bit too cheerful and unbothered about moving in with his sick mother-in-law. What kind of man are you? A small thing, I know. I'll watch the rest, because it's enthralling enough for me to want to know what happens, or rather what happened. But I won't be lying awake at night thinking about it.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/apr/20/the-ice-cream-girls- review Cast * Lorraine Burroughs ‚Äî Serena Farley (n√©e Gorringe) * Jodhi May ‚Äî Poppy Carlisle * Martin Compston ‚Äî Marcus Hansley * Nicholas Pinnock ‚Äî Evan Farley * Georgina Campbell ‚Äî Young Serena Gorringe * Holli Dempsey ‚Äî Young Poppy Carlisle * Dominique Jackson ‚Äî Verity \\"Vee\\" Farley * Bryan Dick ‚Äî Al Francis * Kathy Kiera Clarke ‚Äî Marlene Riley * Do√±a Croll ‚Äî Rachel Gorringe * Sara Powell ‚Äî Fez Gorringe * Eleanor Methven ‚Äî Liz Carlisle * Owen Roe ‚Äî Jim * Michael McElhatton ‚Äî Brian * Laura Jane Laughlin ‚Äî Serena's Lawyer * Dylan Tighe ‚Äî Poppy's Lawyer EpisodesReferencesExternal links * 2013 British television series debuts 2013 British television series endings 2010s British drama television series 2010s British television miniseries English-language television shows ITV television dramas Television series by Left Bank Pictures Television series set in 1995 Television series set in 2013 Television shows set in Brighton 2010s British crime television series ","title":"The Ice Cream Girls"},{"id":"38683350","text":"This page describe all the 2003 seasons of Formula Renault series.

Many players were found guilty of being bribed by betting companies to purposefully lose games, with matches not only limited to domestic leagues in Asia, but also international competitions. 24 players were fined in various degrees, with Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud El Ali being given the most severe punishment: a lifetime ban from the sport and a $15,000 fine. Overview FIFA held an investigation to crack down on match fixing across the world. Their investigation was concentrated mostly on European football, but it also looked at the problem in Africa, South America and in Asia. In 2012, over 50 countries were under investigation for match fixing‚Äîabout one quarter of the entire 209 members overseen by FIFA's governing body. The suspicion of a scandal within Lebanese football began in late 2012, when many Lebanese players were accused of purposefully losing games in the Lebanese league and other leagues across Asia. The scandal was not limited only to matches in football leagues across Asia, but included international matches. Players were bribed by large betting companies to throw games or to put the opposing team in favorable position to win the match. Once the scandal broke, the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) began to investigate allegations that had been made against Lebanese football players. The LFA appointed the general secretary of the West Asian Football Federation (WAFF), Fadi Zreiqat, to lead the investigation. During the two-month-long investigation, involving more than 60 witnesses, Zreiqat concluded there was proof that match fixing was actually occurring. Findings and consequences The Lebanese match-fixing scandal was revealed in a report that led to the suspension of 24 Lebanese players in domestic clubs in Lebanon, Asian clubs, and even the Lebanese national team. In addition to the 24 players, two officials were also involved in match- fixing in Lebanon. Soon after Zreiqat's findings were released, the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) handed out fines and also suspended the individuals involved from playing the sport. 20 Lebanese football players were suspended from playing for one year and given a $2,000 fine, while two players were suspended for three years and given a $7,000 fine each. These 22 players belonged either to the domestic league in Lebanon or other leagues across Asia. The most severe punishments were given to Ramez Dayoub and Mahmoud El Ali. They were each given a $15,000 fine and banned from playing the sport for life. Dayoub and El Ali both played for Lebanon's national football team and also club teams in Asia. The reason their punishments were more severe than those of the other players was because the match fixing took place on the international level while they were playing for the national team. The pair have been associated with attempting and succeeding at manipulating matches on different occasions. These include 2012 Arab Nations Cup matches in Saudi Arabia, and rumors of a match against Qatar in the 2014 World Cup qualifiers. Lebanon advanced for the first time in its history to the fourth and final round of the World Cup qualifiers. Because of the match-fixing scandal, which led to a crucial loss, however, their hopes of qualifying for the 2014 tournament decreased significantly. Theo B√ºcker, the German coach who took control of Lebanon's national team in 2011, and took the team from being unsuccessful and transformed it to qualify for the final round of the World Cup Qualification, was extremely disappointed and frustrated. The team's success included defeating Asian football giants Iran and South Korea. In 2012, Lebanon lost to Qatar in the World Cup Qualifiers 1‚Äì0. Dayoub made an extremely bad pass that was intercepted by the Qatar striker Sebastian Soria who gave his team their only goal to defeat Lebanon. After the investigation was complete, B√ºcker had the following to say: \\"We were showing some action and then suddenly a (Qatar) player has the ball in a one-on-one situation and you get the feeling that something is wrong. The guy looked paralyzed or something.\\" His frustration with Dayoub continued as he said: \\"I never came close to the idea that someone could not just sell the game, but sell their country\\". Soon after the LFA handed out these penalties to the players involved in the match-fixing scandal, FIFA sent a letter praising the Association's response to the report. Details Ramez Dayoub with Selangor in 2012 In February 2013, Ramez Dayoub found himself at the center of a controversy given that, despite the ban suffered by the Lebanese Football Association (LFA), his club, Selangor (India), wanted to field him for the AFC Cup match against Kingfisher East Bengal. At the end of the match, lost by Selangor 1‚Äì0, Dayoub, whose name was canceled from the fixture list a few minutes before the start of the game, told Fox Sports: \\"I am not guilty. They have suspended me and accused me of match fixing without any evidence or proof.\\" Two other domestic players, Nejmeh's Mohammad Jaafar and Ahed's Hadi Sahmarani, were banned for three seasons and handed $7,000 fines for their involvement. Twenty more players were banned for a year and each given $2,000 fines; ten were Ahed players, most notably Akram Moghrabi, who played for Churchill Brothers in the 2012‚Äì13 I-League, Ahmad Zreik, and Hussein Dakik. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) received the summary report from the Lebanese Football Association (LFA) of their investigations and subsequent action against involvement of Lebanese players in match fixing. The AFC had also asked the LFA to provide the full report of their investigation. The LFA informed the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and the football federations of Malaysia and Indonesia of the sanctions on Lebanese players plying their trade in these countries. Player sanctions The player sanctions were divided into three categories: =Category A= Two players received a lifetime suspension from football and a $15,000 fine: * Mahmoud El Ali (Persiba Balikpapan) * Ramez Dayoub (Selangor) =Category B= Two players received a three-season suspension from club football, a lifetime suspension from the national team, and a $7,000 fine: * Mohamad Jaafar (Nejmeh) * Hadi Sahmrani (Ahed) =Category C= Twenty players received a one-season suspension from club football, a lifetime suspension from the national team, and a $2,000 fine: * Mohamad Abou Atik (Ahed) * Hassan Alawiyeh (Nejmeh) * Tarek El Ali (Ahed) * Nazih Assaad (Nejmeh) * Ali Bazzi (Ahed) * Hussein Dakik (Ahed) * Ali Faour (Ahed) * Mohamed Hammoud (Ahed) * Abbas Kenaan (Ahed) * Hassan Mezher (Ahed) * Akram Moghrabi (Churchill Brothers) * Bashar El Mokdad (Safa) * Omar Owaida (Safa) * Issa Ramadan (Chabab Ghazieh) * Ali Al Saadi (Safa) * Hussein Sharifeh (Nejmeh) * Ahmad Younes (Khoyol) * Mohamed Baker Younes (Ahed) * Samer Zeineddine (Nejmeh) * Ahmad Zreik (Ahed) See also *List of sporting scandals  Notes References Lebanon, 2013 Association football controversies Match fixing Match fixing ","title":"2013 Lebanese football match-fixing scandal"},{"id":"38683385","text":"Yuriy Bushman (; born 14 May 1990 in Ukrainian SSR) is a professional Ukrainian football midfielder who plays for Kauno ≈Ωalgiris.

It was built to order, but only one was completed. Design and development The F.K.44 was a two-seat sports aircraft with a parasol wing of constant chord and rounded tips, braced on each side by a pair of struts which diverged from the wing spars to the lower fuselage longerons. It was powered by a 115 hp (87 kW) four-cylinder inverted inline Cirrus-Major engine driving a two blade propeller. The fuselage was flat sided. The seats were placed under the wing, surrounded with cabane struts, with a large rectangular cut-out for enhanced visibility in the trailing edge. Behind them the upper decking sloped away; further aft still the fuselage tapered to the tail. The vertical tail was straight tapered and square tipped, the horizontal tail set just above the top of the fuselage and braced to it and the elevators separate with a cut-out to allow rudder movement. The F.K.44's fixed, conventional undercarriage had mainwheels mounted on long, shallow V-struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons and with substantial tall, vertical legs to the forward wing spar, meeting the wing strut. Operational history The F.K.44 was not intended for production, rather to be built by order. The first such was started but not completed and so the second example was the first and indeed the only one flown. This had been flying for a while on a temporary registration before going on the civil list as PH-AJM' on 28 August 1931. It was owned by Jacob Mees, a banker who punningly christened his Koolhoven the \\"Koolmees\\" or \\"Great Tit\\" in English. The following year Mees gave the Rotterdam Aero Club the use of his aircraft, but it was destroyed in June 1933 during an emergency landing at Castricum following an engine failure.

It was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival. Plot After the Prague Spring the Czech professor, Pavel Navr√°til, who had been teaching philosophy at the university in Prague, has to leave his chair. Henceforth he is restricted to working as a gravedigger in a cemetery and lecturing his students secretly. After three years he is tired of this double life and risks starting a new one. He does not do this secretly, instead he makes a theatrical departure from the Czechoslovakian police-state. He invites his students to the funeral of a dead man whom he does not know himself and who gets a huge grave-stone with the inscription 'Hrdlicka'. He holds a final secret seminar in his flat which, naturally, is observed. He gives away his philosophy books. He says goodbye to his mother, who still thinks he has not grown up, and to his wife and son who he has already left long ago, And he wishes his ex-colleague and arch-enemy well, knowing that he will not forget him. Navr√°til leaves Prague without any difficulty and starts a new life at an airport somewhere in the West. This new life also consists of a double identity. During the day, he is a baggage-man at the airport and on the evenings and days-off he flies back home in this fantasy. There, he encounters all kinds of different and extravagant people, who all seem just as stranded as he himself: an Austrian violin fanatic, a German-Jewish lady and the melancholic and wise Russian Ljubja, who owns a brothel and employs girls from all over the world. With all of these companions in misfortune he celebrates the festivities of home, picnics full of longing and enchantment. And again and again Navr√°til plays flying-to-Prague with the airport barber. He has himself lathered and shaven to the rhythm of the flight calls. But after five years abroad he flies back to Prague once again to say farewell finally to his home country. With a load of airport falcons and an ingeniously implemented birdmask he manages to jump behind the Iron Curtain. He visits the same places again. The house he lived in, Hrdlicka's grave, which he does not find. Instead he meets a young Russian Red Army Soldier with whom he spends the whole night drinking Vodka and discussing ‚Äì since neither of them speaks the language of the opposite, they communicate with hands and feet. At dawn he is picked up by the state police and deported to the West by plane. The authorities' final message before his departure is: \\"Listen carefully. You were not in Prague. No one saw you. You will forget and we will forget that you exist\\". The jet leaves Prague. Navr√°til returns to the West, with a crying and a laughing eye.

The impetus to this project had been her encounter with the Czech actor Pavel Landovsk√Ω who, having been one of the initiators of the petition Charter 77, had been expelled from his home country. He told Knilli about how he once travelled to a shooting from Vienna to Helsinki and was the only passenger who had to stay seated in the plane during its stopover in Prague. There he met a Czech cleaning lady to whom he told his story before the flight continued and he saw ‚Äûhis‚Äú city a last time from far above.Hans-Dieter Seidel, in: FAZ, 28 December 1989 Knilli began writing the screenplay in the summer of 1985 and worked on it for over two years, together with the DEFA-filmmaker Ulrich Wei√ü, whose co- authorship had long been concealed for political reasons by the alias Vera Has.

Knilli had met him in 1983 when she was working as an assistant director for the Czech filmmaker Vojtƒõch Jasn√Ω during the shooting of the television play See you later, I must shoot myself. While shooting this film in Helsinki, Knilli also got to know the French actress of Russian descent Marina Vlady who starred together with Landovsk√Ω and the Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski. Vlady later wrote in her memoirs about Follow Me: ‚ÄûThe script is one of the best I had read in years. It‚Äôs full of poetry, a poetry of images, a poetry of human relationships.‚ÄúMarina Vlady, in: 24 Images/Seconde, Fayard, Paris 2005, p. 300 Style Follow Me distinguishes itself through its vast abstinence of linear narration. Instead, the various states of consciousness are visualised through a diversity of formal stylistic devices. Follow Me is like a stream of consciousness, which has to suck the audience into its confidence. The vivid story is forced open. Externally unusual perspectives, views, tours d'horizon, rise up, reality is suspended in favour of the supernatural. There is no interest in simply focusing-in for minutes on end on the finished image, but additional demands are made of the fantasy. What she has to say is at least as poetical as it is political.‚ÄúHans-Dieter Seidel, in: FAZ, 28 December 1989 Thus begins a game of signs and images. Knilli explained her approach in an interview at the time of the film‚Äôs release: ‚ÄòFollow Me‚Äò is reduced to internals. I have looked for variations at a visual level for the interior condition. (...) I am inclined to consider things from a certain distance. I observe for a long time, and I only work on something which I have observed when I am not embroiled in feelings. I hate mawkishness.\\"Maria Knilli, in: Hans-Dieter Seidel, FAZ, 28 December 1989 ReferencesExternal links * 1989 films 1989 drama films West German films German drama films German-language films ","title":"Follow Me (film)"},{"id":"38683565","text":"The Anglesey by-election, 1923 was a parliamentary by-election for the British House of Commons constituency of Anglesey on 7 April 1923. Vacancy The by- election was caused by the death of the sitting Labour MP, Sir Owen Thomas on 17 January 1923. He had been MP here since winning the seat in 1918. Election history Anglesey had been won by either the Liberal Party or the Whigs at every election since 1784, until Thomas surprisingly gained it for Labour in 1918. He held onto it at the 1922 general election, standing as an Independent. The result at the last General Election was as follows; Owen Thomas Candidates *The Labour party selected Edward John to defend the seat. He had been Liberal MP for East Denbighshire from December 1910-18. John, a pacifist, had left the Liberals to stand unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in 1918. He was a prominent Welsh Nationalist. *The Liberal candidate was again Sir Robert Thomas, the former Wrexham MP who had fought here at the 1922 general election. Thomas was a ship and insurance broker. Thomas had been allied to Lloyd George and had stood as a National Liberal last time. Even though the Liberals nationally had been divided between followers of Asquith and Lloyd George, the local Liberals managed to unite behind Thomas. *Even though the Coalition Government between the National Liberals and the Unionists had ended, the local Unionists chose not to contest the seat in 1922. However, for the by-election, they decided to intervene and field their own candidate, Richard Owen Roberts. Roberts had stood for the Unionists at Anglesey in 1910. He was a Barrister and sat on the London County Council for Lewisham East. Campaign Labour's campaign was supported by visits from national figures such as Arthur Henderson, and a host of Labour MPs from south Wales such as David Watts Morgan, Tom Griffiths, David Grenfell and T. I. Mardy Jones, as well as prominent Welsh nationalist figures such as future Liberal MP William John Gruffydd and Principal Thomas Rees. John called for Welsh Home Rule, even though it was not Labour party policy. Result The Liberal party gained the seat from Labour and the Unionists trailed a poor third; Robert Thomas The good Liberal result spurred moves towards Liberal reunion at a national level. Within days, the two Liberal groups in the House of Lords decided to accept Viscount Grey as their leader in the Lords. Aftermath Sir Robert Thomas sat for the constituency until retiring in 1929. The Liberal Party held the constituency until 1951. The result at the following General election; John did not stand again. Roberts did not stand again and became a County Court Judge in 1924.

Its large and distinctive buff fruit bodies are common after rainfall. Taxonomy English mycologists Mordecai Cubitt Cooke and George Edward Massee described this species as Agaricus ochrophyllus in 1889, from a specimen collected from \\"sandy land near Brisbane\\". They thought it allied to Macrolepiota procera and placed it in the subgenus Lepiota. They described its gills as having the colour of \\"washed leather\\". Pier Andrea Saccardo named it Lepiota ochrophylla in 1891. It was placed in the genus Amanita by Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland in 1924. Within the genus Amanita, it is in the subgenus Lepidella, section Lepidella and subsection Gymnopodae. Molecular analysis showed an close relationship with Amanita proxima. Description side view showing double ring and base The fruit body is a large stocky buff- or ochre-coloured mushroom sometimes with shades of orange or pink on the stalk or cap. The cap is convex and rounded when young and opening out and flattening to flat-convex or flat. Reaching up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter, the cap is often covered with small thin flat scales that are slightly paler than the cap colour. The thin crowded gills are free, and cream or buff, becoming darker as the mushroom ages. The spore print is white. The thick stalk has a double ring which helps identify it. The main upper ring is attached high up on the stalk just underneath the gills. It is membranous and can break off. The second ring is smaller and thicker. The solid stalk is up to 15 cm (6 in) high and 2 cm (0.8 in) wide. The large bulbous base is shaped like an inverted cone, and up to 4 cm (1.6 in) in diameter. Under a microscope, the spores are oval-shaped and measure 9.3‚Äì10.8 by 5.4‚Äì7.4 Œºm. The mushrooms have a stale odour, reminiscent of ants. Distribution and habitat Found across the southeastern part of the continent, Amanita ochrophylla has been recorded from southeastern South Australia, Victoria, throughout New South Wales and Queensland. Forestry records from Tasmania have it recorded predominantly from wet forests. It has been recorded from Mount Wellington. The fruit bodies appear after heavy rainfall. It often appears on roadsides. A field study showed that A. ochrophylla fruit bodies of identical genetic profile were found up covering areas of up 60 m (200 ft) diameter, suggesting a single genet was responsible, and that hence these units could be up to 60 m (200 ft) diameter in undisturbed eucalypt forest. Toxicity Its smell would usually preclude people trying to consume it, and its edibility is unknown. At Wedderburn south of Sydney, a Lao family picked and consumed this species along with Amanita volvarielloides. One member suffered poisoning with hepatotoxic effects similar to those of deadly amanitas; however, the latter fungus was the likely agent.

The initial collection was of mushrooms growing on rocky black soil under peppermint gums and bracken at an altitude of 850 m (2800 ft) southeast of the town of Matlock in Gippsland, Victoria.

Life  He was born at Pinmore in the parish of Ayr, Scotland. His father was Robert Kennedy of Pinmore, and his mother, Robina, was the daughter of John Vans of Barnbarroch, Wigtownshire, who, on marrying his cousin, assumed the name of Agnew. Robert Kennedy was ruined by the failure of the Ayr bank, and had to sell Pinmore and move to Edinburgh, where he died in 1790. Kennedy was the youngest son; one of his sisters was writer Grace Kennedy. He was educated at Edinburgh, Berkhamsted, and at Monmouth. He returned to Edinburgh at the age of 14, obtained a cadetship, and sailed for Bombay (Mumbai) in 1800. Shortly after his arrival Kennedy was employed with his corps, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Grenadiers, in an attack against the Malabar district, where he received a wound in his neck from which he suffered all his life. In 1807, he became Persian interpreter to the Peshwa's subsidiary force at Sirur, then commanded by Colonel William Wallace (died 1809). While at Sirur, Kennedy knew Sir Barry Close and Sir James Mackintosh. In 1817, Kennedy was appointed judge-advocate-general to the Bombay army. Mountstuart Elphinstone, who admired him as a scholar, gave him the appointment of MarƒÅthƒÅ and GujarƒÅti translator of the regulations of government, but the post was abolished a few months after Elphinstone's retirement. He held the office of judge-advocate- general until 1835, when he was removed by Sir John Keane. After that, he was appointed oriental translator to the government, and he held this office for the rest of his life. Kennedy died unmarried in Bombay on 29 December 1846, and was buried in the European cemetery at Back-Bay.  Works  Kennedy was studious, collected manuscripts and employed munshi teachers. In 1817, he contributed a paper on Persian literature to the Literary Society of Bombay; he also contributed several papers to the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society and was President of the branch from 1831 to 1835. In 1824, Kennedy published at Bombay a Maratha dictionary. In London, he published Researches into the Origin and Affinity of the Principal Languages of Asia and Europe (1828), and in 1831 he followed this up with Researches into the Nature and Affinity of Ancient and Hindu Mythology. In the first work, he remarked on the Arabic words in the ShƒÅhnƒÅma. Kennedy also wrote five letters on the PurƒÅnas, and engaged in controversy with Horace Hayman Wilson and Graves Champney Haughton. In 1832, he published a work on military law, of which a second edition appeared in 1847.

Military career=Burma and India= Palin joined the 2nd Battalion Cheshire Regiment in Burma and saw active service in the latter stages of the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Then on 15 June 1888 he transferred to the Indian Staff Corps and was appointed to 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs. He served with the regiment on the Hazara Expedition of 1888, the Waziristan Expedition of 1894‚Äì95 and the Tochi Field Force of 1897‚Äì98 on the North-West Frontier. He was promoted to Captain in 1897 and served for five years (1899‚Äì1904) as permanent adjutant of the three battalions of the Calcutta Volunteer Rifles.India List, 1902. Having been promoted to Major in 1904, Palin reached the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in 1912, and was appointed to command the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs. By the outbreak of World War I Palin had transferred to command his own regiment, the 14th Sikhs. The regiment joined 29th Indian Brigade in October 1914 and went with it to Egypt. After defeating a Turkish Raid on the Suez Canal in February 1915, the brigade was sent to Gallipoli in April 1915.Perry pp. 116‚Äì8. =Gallipoli= The brigade landed at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula where Palin and his Sikhs took part in the Second and Third Battles of Krithia. In the Second Battle, the 14th Sikhs were in reserve as the Anzacs attacked.Bean, p. 25. In the Third Battle, the 29th India Brigade under Maj-Gen Herbert Cox attacked along Gully Spur and Gully Ravine; the Sikhs, advancing along the Gully floor, suffered especially heavily. The bombardment had been inadequate and the Turkish defences were intact. 'The result was that, though the 14th Sikhs on the right flank pushed on despite losses amounting to three-fourths of their effectives, the centre of the Brigade could make no headway'.Sir Ian Hamilton's Second Gallipoli Despatch, quoted in The Long, Long Trail In 29 August Indian Brigade was secretly moved from Helles to ANZAC Cove, but were greeted by shellfire on landing on 5 August, and part of the 14th Sikhs had to wait until the next night to land. They then took part in the Battle of Sari Bair on 7 August alongside Australian troops, all under Cox's command. Palin commanded one of the four attacking columns, but like Cox and the other commanders was provided with no staff and the objectives set for them were beyond attainment. 14th Sikhs got onto Rhododendron Spur and made contact with 4th Australian Brigade on their flank. The Australians were ordered to go on with the Sikhs and assault Hill 305 (Koja Chemen Tepe), but it was found to be impossible.North, pp. 105‚Äì10, 216, 227.Masefield, pp. 175‚Äì8.Bean, p. 635. In the subsequent attempt to capture Hill 60, the artillery preparation was again inadequate, casualties were very heavy, and the objective remained untaken.North, pp. 227, 234. Hill 60 was the last major British attack of the Gallipoli campaign. The fighting settled down to trench warfare until the British evacuated the peninsula in December 1915 and January 1916.

Palin however survived, and when Cox was wounded, Palin was promoted to Temporary Brigadier- General on 25 September 1915 to succeed him. =Egypt and Palestine= Palin continued in command of 29th Indian Brigade in Egypt after the evacuation of Gallipoli. Palin's brigade was stationed in defence of the Suez Canal, and in November 1916 he led out a column to drive off a Turkish detachment. In February 1917 he was appointed to command the Southern Sector of the Suez Canal defences. On 25 June 1917 Palin was promoted to Temporary Major-General to command 75th Division, a new formation being created within the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) from British Territorial Force infantry battalions arriving as reinforcements from India. The War Office had changed its policy and decided to include some Indian battalions as well, and these initially came from Palin's old 29th Indian Brigade. A year later the 75th Division was 'Indianised' like several other nominally British divisions in the EEF, so that each brigade comprised one British and three Indian battalions, the other British battalions being sent to the Western Front. One of 75th Division's three field artillery brigades was composed of South Africans.Becke Pt 2b, pp. 123‚Äì30. 75th Division under Palin joined XXI Corps and took part in the invasion of Palestine, beginning with the Third Battle of Gaza on 27 October 1917, leading to the capture of Gaza (6‚Äì7 November) and Junction Station (13‚Äì14 November), the advance through the Judean Hills and the Battle of Nebi Samwil (20‚Äì24 November). In the Spring of 1918 the division was involved in the actions at Tell 'Asur (11‚Äì12 March) and Berukin (9‚Äì11 April). In the summer of 1918, 75th Division joined General Allenby's final offensive (the Battles of Megiddo). At the Battle of Sharon (19 September), 75th Division successfully assaulted Miske and the Turkish trench system around the village of Et Tire. For this attack Palin also had under his command 'A' Squadron (Duke of Lancaster's Own Yeomanry)Becke Pt 4, pp. 254‚Äì5. and 2nd Light Armoured Motor Battery, Machine Gun Corps, which he sent up with his chief of staff to outflank the village.Falls, pp. 479‚Äì80. By 17.00, XXI Corps' attack had rolled up the whole Turkish right and allowed the Desert Mounted Corps to sweep forward to complete the envelopment of the Turkish army and begin the pursuit. =Postwar= After the end of the fighting on 19 September, Palin's 75th Division was left on salvage work and road repair until the Armistice with the Turks was signed on 31 October. Demobilisation began early in 1919, but 75th Division was selected for the Army of Occupation of Palestine. In March 1919 it returned to garrison duty in Egypt, where Palin became responsible for the Eastern Delta, which was renamed 75th Division Area. Many other units were attached to his headquarters for this work. After July 1919 the disturbances in Egypt began to die down, and units began to disperse to their home countries. On 1 April 1920 the Division Area and remaining troops were handed over to 10th (Irish) Division and 75th Division ceased to exist. =Awards= Palin was awarded the CB in 1916 and the CMG in 1918, and in 1919 he was knighted (KCMG). During the war he had been mentioned in despatches eight times and promoted to Brevet Colonel. He was also awarded the Serbian Order of Karageorge and the Egyptian Order of the Nile. In 1920 Palin was appointed Colonel of his old regiment, the 14th Sikhs (later 1st Battalion 11th Sikh Regiment).Kempton The Palin Commission On completing the disbandment of 75th Division, Palin became commander of 3rd (Lahore) Division, a Regular Indian Army formation in the Palestine occupation force.Perry, p. 54. Shortly after taking up this command, he was appointed to chair a Commission of Inquiry into the Jerusalem riots that had occurred on 4‚Äì7 April 1920. The other members of the Commission were Brig-Gen E.H. Wildblood (one of his former brigadiers in 75th Division) and Lt-Col C. Vaughan Edwards. Assisted by a legal adviser, they sat for 50 days and examined 152 witnesses in eight languages.Palin Report published by Brendan McKay The Palin Commission's report was submitted in August 1920 but was never published, despite Allenby's recommendation that it should be. The report highlights the conflict between the promises of the 1917 Balfour Declaration on a Jewish homeland, which had encouraged Jewish immigration to Palestine, and of an Inter-Allied Commission to inquire into Palestinian self-determination, which was never fully formed. The report criticised all parties: Haj Amin al- Husseini, later Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, for inciting the Arabs to violence; Ze'ev Jabotinsky, organiser of the Jewish paramilitary defence organisation Haganah; the British military command in Jerusalem that had initially withdrawn troops from the streets; and the divided political chain of command from London. Both al-Husseini and Jabotinsky were given prison sentences for their part in the affair. (Ironically, both had led forces alongside the British against the Ottoman Turks during the recent war.) By the time the report was completed the British military administration of Palestine had already been altered to a civilian administration under a High Commissioner. Private life Palin retired from the army in 1921. In 1899 he had married Diamantine Harriet, daughter of Lt-Col G. Elliot of the 18th Royal Irish Regiment. They had no children, and after she died in 1934 he was remarried (1935) to Gladys, widow of Dr John Love. Palin died on 22 January 1937 at his home at 7 Cromwell Road, Hove, Sussex. His funeral took place on 25 January at Holy Trinity Church, Hove, and he was buried at Hove Cemetery. NotesReferences * C.E.W.

Early life Menuhin was born in San Francisco, California, the fourth son of his father Yehudi Menuhin and the second of his mother Diana Gould Menuhin. He attended Eton College near Windsor, Berkshire. He describes his childhood as economically privileged but emotionally \\"grotesque\\", his father as \\"cold and detached\\", and his mother as \\"domineering and volatile\\". Unlike father Yehudi, who was pushed towards music at a young age by his own mother (Jeremy's grandmother), Jeremy himself did not have any musical education until his nanny began arranging it in response to his interest. However, Yehudi began paying more attention to his son's musical career when his talent became clear. Jeremy studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, piano in Israel with Mindru Katz, and conducting in Vienna with Hans Swarowsky. Musical career Menuhin made his London debut at the age of 15, on his father's fiftieth birthday, performing with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Later that year, he played at the Menuhin Festival Gstaad established by his father nine years earlier, and proceeded to wider public attention as a musician in his own right. In 1968, he played with the London Philharmonic again to record an LP for Angel Records along with aunts Hephzibah and Yaltah, all conducted by Yehudi. He made his American debut in 1970. The development of his career was interrupted in 1974 by a strained tendon, forcing him to cancel all public performances for a year and a half. However, he recovered and would go on to win the Young Concert Artists piano competition in New York in 1984. During his American tour in 1986, he played at the Miami Beach Theater of the Performing Arts. Reviewer Tim Smith from the Sun-Sentinel praised his technical skill but found his performance lacking in emotion. Menuhin has played with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Royal Philharmonic, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic, and the Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich among others. His recording of Bartok's Sonatas for violin and piano with his father, Yehudi Menuhin, was awarded the 'Grand prix du Disque'. In recent years Menuhin has rediscovered composing, a legacy of his years with Nadia Boulanger. Among his works he has written a Suite for two pianos in the Baroque Manner, a String Quartet, a piece for 'cello and piano four hands', a Fantasy for two pianos, a double piano concerto and transformed two movements of the Brahms sextets as well as the title movement from Schubert's Death and the Maiden Quartet. Personal life In 1983, he married Brigid Gabriel Forbes-Sempill, the daughter of William Forbes-Sempill, 19th Lord Sempill, with whom he had two children, Nadya Cecilia Menuhin (born 1985) and Petroc Forbes Menuhin (born 1988). In response to his own childhood experiences, Menuhin placed a great emphasis on being involved in his children's lives; even after he and his wife later divorced, they continued to live within walking distance of each other so that Menuhin could maintain contact with his son. In 2007, he married South Korean pianist Mookie Lee, with whom he has a daughter, Anouk Chiara Sumi Menuhin (born 2008).

When the Rollin White patent for metallic cartridges firearms manufacture expired (c. 1870) the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company started working on its own metallic cartridge revolvers. Thus, after having introduced its first breech- loaders in 1871 (Colt House/Cloverleaf) and 1872 (Colt Open Top), in 1873 Colt launched the Colt Peacemaker along with a new line of pocket revolvers, sorted in five different calibers. Since it was an entirely new line of revolvers this model was called the Colt New Line.

The Freud caf√© is housed in the former St Paul's Church, a Greek Revival building designed in 1836 by Henry Jones Underwood. The church was inspired by an outbreak of cholera in the area in 1831. The building has an imposing portico with Ionic columns. The architect Edward George Bruton added the apse in 1853 and Frederick Charles Eden remodelled the interior in 1908. In the 20th century, the building became a redundant church and was closed in the late 1960s. After deconsecration, the building was bought by the Oxford Area Arts Council and used as a theatre and arts centre venue. In 1988, the building was acquired by Secession Ltd to prevent the building's demolition. Freud opened as a caf√©/bar in the same year. The cafe was created by David Freud, a graduate of the Courtauld Institute of Art, who has an interest in buildings and their interaction with people.

Description It is located about north east of Cloncurry and south of Croydon in Queensland. The station occupies an area of approximately one million acres, , and is the primary breeding ground for the Acton Land and Cattle Company, which is able to stock 40,000 head of cattle. The property has at least one outstation, Crowfels, which has a Santa Gertrudis stud. The station is situated in the Queensland Gulf country a generally flat tropical savannah with plains of mitchell grass. The property has some frontage along the Flinders River and is close to the Saxby River. History The station was established in 1864 along with nearby Taldora Station by the pioneer James Gibson in 1864. Gibson had also established the first property along the Flinders River, Prairie, in 1861. In 1880 the property was still owned by James Gibson and Company. The Melbourne Queensland Pastoral Company was set up with capital of ¬£120,000 to purchase both Millungera and Taldora Station which had a combined area of 937,600 acres along with 20,000 head of cattle for ¬£80,000 leaving plenty of capital left for further development, the property had been inspected by William Meredith who was to manage the station. Meredith died in 1881 with his share of the station and stock being passed onto Salome Meredith of Brisbane. In 1886 Millungera was owned by Meredith, Menzies and C. and the property was being managed by Mr Nutting. The homestead had been built by this stage and was described by a visitor as the home station house a good one, built at great expense with a 12 foot verandah all around, good kitchen and stores and outbuildings with a permanent hole of water close by Meredth's grave was also located just a short distance from the homestead. A total area of was resumed from Millungera early in 1907 which was cut into eight separate properties in the hope of attracting immigrants to the area. Large tracts of grazing country at the station were burnt out by bushfires later the same year, other properties surrounding Millungera were similarly affected. While some of the surrounding districts were struck by drought in 1928, Millungera was inundated by of rain in 24 hours. The herds at Millungera and surrounding properties affected by the condition known as pegleg in 1929. This condition is a phosphate deficiency and it was recommended that the cattle were provided with Nauru phosphate salts. The station was put up for auction along with all the plant, improvements and 24,800 head of cattle in 1930. All of the pastoral holdings separate leases were listed in the sale, Millungera , Tharwan , Savannah Downs , Kuradin , East Creek and other smaller leases. The holding, with a total area of , was passed in with no bids. In 1933 an experiment was conducted to introduce Zebu cattle into the herd to make the English bred stock would give them resistance to tropical diseases and cope better with the tropical conditions. The station was still owned by Meredith Menzies Pty Ltd at this time. In 1950 a stockman, Alan Doyle, went missing in the heavily timbered Savannah portion of the holding prompting a search party to be sent out. Doyle was the third person that had gone missing at Millungera in a period of five weeks. Doyle was found a week later after feeding himself on boiled grass and goanna. CSR Limited auctioned off the property, which the Actons bought for 7 million in 1985 with its 26,000 head of cattle.

The proposed line was first mentioned in 2007 when the then Premier of Tasmania Paul Lennon, announced that a new dedicated transport hub would be constructed on Hobart's northern fringe. The completion of this transport hub in 2014 left the southernmost section of the railway line vacant. While the intermodal operations were moved to Brighton, the intention is to maintain a working port for Hobart and therefore the new arrangement will need to accommodate for the occasional freight train. The original concept is similar in length to the Gold Coast Light Rail system, except this project will be constructed along an already present rail corridor (similar to Sydney's Inner West Light Rail) which has the potential to save considerable capital costs. Despite strong public support, the future of the proposed light rail remains uncertain due to a lack of political enthusiasm. While the major political parties have given in principle support to the development (dependent on federal funding), only the Tasmanian Greens have made a firm commitment to ensure its completion. Tasmanian Greens leader Nick McKim made an election commitment to divert funding away from the state's roads if necessary to ensure the first stage was completed. History In conjunction with the Main Road, Hobart's northern suburbs have been developed around the Southern Railway Line - The two transport corridors are on a near parallel trajectory. Following the end of operations for trams in 1960, trolleybuses managed the city's public transport which in turn were replaced by conventional buses in 1964. The low-density population of Hobart has caused the bus timetables being planned on a low- frequency, high-penetration basis - Bus routes are often lengthy, and can take a long time to reach their final destination, as they attempt to service the widely spread-out suburbs. This has contributed to Hobart having the second lowest public transport patronage in Australia and as a result is very much a car orientated city. The Brooker Highway was opened in stages from 1961 to alleviate traffic congestion on the Main Road. In 1965 a transportation study was released offering a set plan on constructing and upgrading Hobart's Highways. While this transport study was seen as more of a \\"highway plan\\" rather than a \\"comprehensive transport plan, it did provide clear guidelines for the Brooker Highway including grade separation and additional lanes. However these guidelines have not been followed for the southern portion on the highway. With Annual average daily traffic of 48,000, the Brooker Highway is currently below the acceptable levels of service and congestion issues are expected to worsen significantly over the next 20 years with the Highway already approaching its designed capacity. While at present, Brooker Highway is considerably less congested than in other states during peak hours, it is more congested off-peak than roads in Queensland and Western Australia, and almost as congested as those in New South Wales. It is thus a busy road by any Australian standard. The South Railway Line ceased operation on a permanent basis by freight trains when Toll Holdings relocated its intermodal operations from the Hobart Railyards to the Brighton Transport Hub in 2014. As a result, traffic on the Brooker Highway is expected to increase. When announcing the construction of the Brighton Transport Hub, Premier Paul Lennon stated that when complete the Southern Railway Line - south of the Intermodal facility - would no longer be used on a permanent basis. He spoke of the possibility of the railway line opening up to commuter traffic. In 2008, The Australian Institute of Architects and the Planning Institute identified the South Line as an ideal route for an express O-Bahn Style Bus. Proposals In 2009, Ben Johnston, a local engineer and rail enthusiast, founded an organisation known as the Northern Suburbs Rail Action Group and proceeded to release a detailed proposal for the corridor. It was to be a zero-emission, electric/battery rail transportation service that traverses the South Railway Line starting at the City (Mawson Place) and passing New Town, Moonah, Glenorchy, Berriedale, Claremont, Granton and Bridgewater on its way to Brighton. Additionally, there are also many attractions in close proximity to the proposed light rail line, including the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the Hobart Cenotaph, the Royal Hobart Showground, Tattersalls Park, the Derwent Entertainment Centre, KGV Oval, the Tasmanian Transport Museum, MONA and Cadbury's Chocolate Factory. In order to retain the existing intercity cycleway, some stations would have passing loops and recharging facilities to allow trains to travel in both directions on the single track and batteries to be recharged whilst passengers embark/disembark. =Business Case= In 2010, a community advisory panel was created for the purposes of assisting the creation of a Business case study. A Business case undertaken by Acil Tasman was published in 2011. The conclusions included (but were not limited to): *Considerable work would need to be done on the track to make it suitable and safe for passenger use. *The last three stations on the proposed line (Granton, Bridgewater and Brighton) were deemed to be unviable as part of the proposal. *Either diesel or overhead electric traction would be suitable, but battery power is likely to involve higher risks. With five vehicles, the cost of rolling stock would be roughly AU$25 million. Following the release of the business case, the Northern Suburbs Railway Action group withdrew from the Light Rail Community Advisory Panel due to what Ben Johnston described as a \\"fundamentally flawed passenger demand analysis\\" limiting the proposal to Claremont. He also expressed concern that Transport Minister, Nick McKim was backflipping on key election promises by supporting the adaptation. =Political process= In 2011, the Tasmanian Government's Infrastructure Australia submission included a AU$213 million Brooker Highway upgrade wishlist. This was submitted in the absence of any submission for the Northern Suburbs Light Rail, costed at AU$100 million - Less than half the price of the highway upgrades. The government was urged to make a submission for the railway. With Federal and state elections looming, the Northern Suburbs Railway received tri partisan support from the major political parties in early 2013. Federal Denison MP, Andrew Wilkie called on the Liberal and Labor parties to each commit AU$100 million to the project during Parliament. Soon after, The Tasmanian Government announced the creation of a high-powered taskforce to push the case for a light rail link through the city's northern suburbs. Transport Minister Nick McKim stated that he had ordered a new business case for the link, which he wants to put before the Federal Government's funding process by May. However, Mr McKim also said he would be pushing for a Hobart to Glenorchy link, rather than the proposed Hobart to Bridgewater line. He said this was because the route would increase the cost- to-benefit ratio, which would make it easier to attract critical federal funding. Prominent local businessman, David Walsh even weighed into the debate stating that the proposed light rail should extend beyond Bridgewater and into Gagebrook. Mr Walsh said it took an hour to travel by bus from the far northern suburbs to the CBD, which was too long. He added that his support for the railway was a matter of social justice. The most recent proposed route being pursued by the state government commences at Mawson Place and ends in close proximity to the Museum of Old and New Art, within the suburb of Berriedale. proponents of the light rail have recently called on the state government to extend the transport corridor to North Hobart. The fate of the light rail is unknown after the feasibility study was scrapped as part of the Abbott Government's federal budget of 2014.

Taxonomy and systematics A population previously thought to be a separate species, as Gracixalus waza, was described from the Ha Lang District in northern Vietnam. This population was named for the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), to acknowledge their support of amphibian research and conservation in Vietnam and the common name Waza treefrog was suggested for it. It is now considered as a junior synonym of Gracixalus nonggangensis. Description Gracixalus nonggangensis is a medium-sized species compared to others in its genus. Adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length and females . The snout is rounded, slightly protruding. The head is as wide or wider than it is long. The tympanum is distinct and rounded, and the canthus rostralis is rounded. The supratympanic fold is distinct. The forelimbs are relatively short. The fingers have no webbing but have well-developed discs at their tips. The toes are webbed. The toe discs are smaller than the finger discs. The skin is smooth except for some granularity behind the tympanum, flanks, belly, and the limbs. Dorsal coloration varies from light greenish brown to moss-green. There is a dark brown, blotched pattern between eyes that continues backwards as two bands (forming a Y-like mark), and a dark stripe in the middle of posterior part of dorsum. The limbs have some dark brown bands. The throat and chest are white with dark brown marbling, whereas the belly is immaculate white. Habitat and conservation In Vietnam, Gracixalus nonggangensis seems to be associated with karst landscape. Specimens were found near cave entrances and in valleys surrounded by limestone mountains, with the main habitat in the area being secondary karst forest consisting of hardwoods mixed with shrubs and vines. The elevational range is above sea level. The records are some distance away from water (minimum distance about ). The call was not heard during the periods surveys. Animals are active by night. Most individuals were found low on trees some above the ground, but two individuals were found on a limestone cliff inside a cave.

This proprietary blend's proposed mechanism of action is to improve the strength of cell membranes. It also reduces inflammation and can therefore improve joint mobility. Celadrin is a topical analgesic that exists in a cream formulation and is used for muscle and joint pains including osteoarthritis, strains, bruises, and sprains. The only active ingredient in this over-the-counter drug formulation is menthol. It is distributed by Imagenetix of San Diego, California. Published studies A human study showed that one week of treatment with a topical cream consisting of cetylated fatty acids (Celadrin) and menthol was similarly effective for reducing pain and improving functional performance in individuals with arthritis of the knee, elbow, and wrist; these data support the use of a topical cream consisting of cetylated fatty acids (with or without menthol) for enhancing the potential for exercise training in this population. Another human study concluded that compared to placebo, CFA (cetylated fatty acids; Celadrin) provides an improvement in knee range of motion and overall function in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee; thus CFA may be an alternative to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of OA. An in vitro study that investigated the effects of glucosamine (a dietary supplement used for knee osteoarthritis) and celadrin on platelet function concluded that glucosamine and celadrin may inhibit platelet aggregation in some individuals via aspirin-like effects as well as inhibition of ADP receptor P2Y1, but not P2Y12  Interactions  The antiplatelet effects of cealdrin (see above) mean that theoretically celadrin may interact with blood thinners (such as aspirin, clopidogrel and warfarin), although this interaction has not been studied, and it is doubtful if this interaction occurs with the topical application of celadrin where the systemic absorbance is low.

It is widespread in the Eastern Atlantic from Norway to Mauritania, including Macaronesia and the western Mediterranean. Description The blackspot seabream is a fish with a moderately deep body, a rounded snout and large eyes which have a diameter greater than the length of the snout. It has small sharp teeth and larger, flatter teeth set into the sides of the jaws. It has a long dorsal fin which has 12 spines in the anterior portion and 12‚Äì13 branched rays in the posterior portion. The shorter anal fin has 3 spines and 12‚Äì13 branched rays. The pectoral fins are relatively long and are pointed at their tips. The back and upper flanks are reddish in colour and the lower part of the body is silvery with a pinkish tinge. There is a black spot situated directly above the base of the pectoral fin. The maximum recorded standard length is but a more common standard length is . The largest published weight is . Distribution The blackspot seabream is largely found in the waters of the eastern North Atlantic from Norway south to Cape Blanc in Mauritania, its range extends into the western Mediterranean as far as the Strait of Sicily and the Adriatic. It is also found around the Canary Islands and the Azores and has been recorded off Iceland. Habitat and biology The blackspot seabream occurs in inshore waters above different types of substrates, rocks, sand and mud. It ranges down to in the Mediterranean but down to in the Atlantic. The young fish are found near the coast while the adults are found on the continental slope, particularly over areas with a muddy substrate. This is an omnivorous species which has a diverse diet of crustaceans, molluscs, and small fish. It can eat plant matter as well. The blackspot seabream is a protoandrous hermaphrodite, early in its lifecycle it is male then between the ages of 2 and 7, however, it becomes female. Spawning occurs throughout the year, with a peaks dependent on location. it is August to October off the British Isles and January to April in the Bay of Biscay. Farther south the spawning peaks are in January to March off Morocco and in January to May in the Mediterranean). A femaleof standard length can lay 70,000‚Äì500,000 eggs. They are mature at 4‚Äì5 years old when they are in length. It is a gregarious species which migrates to coastal waters to spawn. Human utilisation The blackspot sea bream is an important food fish which is marketed fresh and frozen around the Mediterranean. Fishing is done using trawls, trammel nets and bottom long lines. Fishing for this species is done on a semi-industrial basis or by artisanal fishermen, it is also a sport fish. It regularly available in the fish markets of France, Spain, Morocco and Italy, however it is only occasionally found in such markets in Sicily, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey. It was heavily exploited by the artisanal fleet of the Strait of Gibraltar where boats from Andalusia fished for blackspot seabream using a vertical deep water longline called a voracera which was baited with small sardines. Today, this species commands a high price in the Spanish domestic market as a result of overfishing, and a near monopoly of landings in Tarifa and this has resulted in an increase in imported fish from Portugal and Morocco. It has also been used to produce fishmeal and oil. It is grown in aquaculture off Spain.

He entered the Middle Temple in 1871 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1873, becoming Queen's Counsel in 1884. In 1878 he married Ellen Hunter, daughter of Samuel Hunter of Coleraine, who died in 1916; they had no children.Ball p.382 He was a long-standing member of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, and served as its President 1894‚Äì1896. Career Dodd was throughout his life a loyal member of the Liberal Party, and this hampered his career, as the Liberals were in opposition during precisely the years when he could have hoped to be appointed to the Bench, although he did become Third Serjeant-at-law, which was a Crown office, in 1892.Hart, A.R. History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland Four Courts Press Dublin 2000 p.168 He stood for Parliament, unsuccessfully, in North Antrim in 1892 and South Londonderry in 1895.Hart p.168 In 1906 he reached the House of Commons at last, and was made a High Court judge the following year.Ball p,382 According to Maurice Healy, his failure to reach the Bench until he was over sixty caused a good deal of friction with his colleagues, since he had a high opinion of his own legal ability, and was unwilling to defer to the judgments of his colleagues, some of whom were considerably younger than himself.Healy, Maurice The Old Munster Circuit 1939 Mercier Press Edition p.41 During the transitional arrangements following the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, Dodd, like most of his colleagues, remained a High Court judge. However Hugh Kennedy, the new Chief Justice of Ireland, had an extremely low opinion of the judges of the old regime and was determined to remove them en bloc. In Dodd's case this was achieved tactfully, since the Courts of Justice Act 1924 imposed an age limit of 72, and Dodd, who was 80, was deemed to have automatically retired. He died in 1930.Hart p.168 Character Maurice Healy in his memoirs describes Dodd as a man of rough appearance and manner (his nickname was \\"the mechanic\\"), which concealed a great deal of kindness; he was rather tactless, but had the gift of being able to take a joke against himself.Healy pp.40-42 His main fault was vanity, and while Healy thought him a good judge, his very high estimate of his own talents was apparently not shared by his colleagues. Healy admired him for never compromising his political principles, at the cost of delaying his elevation to the Bench by at least a decade. His late arrival on the Bench led him to clash with his colleagues: according to Maurice Healy, Peter O'Brien, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, once reminded him pointedly in open Court that he was the junior judge (although O'Brien could fairly have pointed out that Dodd was two years younger as well). Fortunately, according to Healy, one of Dodd's virtues was magnanimity, and he was incapable of bearing a grudge.Healy pp.41-2 References External links   1844 births 1930 deaths Irish barristers People from County Down Members of the Middle Temple Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Tyrone constituencies (1801‚Äì1922) Alumni of Queen's University Belfast People educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution UK MPs 1906‚Äì1910 Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland Judges of the High Court of Justice in Ireland Irish Liberal Party MPs Serjeants-at-law (Ireland) ","title":"William Huston Dodd"},{"id":"38684605","text":"'Dhindhwal is a clan or gotra of Jats in Rajasthan and Haryana in India.

Biography After receiving a PhD in Mathematical Physics at the University of Milan, Magli developed his academic career at the Politecnico of Milan, where he became full professor of Mathematical Physics in 2005. Since 2009, he has taught a course on archaeoastronomy, first ever such course offered in an Italian University. Work In the field of relativistic astrophysics, Magli has worked on the so-called Cosmic Censorship conjecture. He was the first to find the general exact solution of the Einstein field equations for spherically symmetric spacetimes with tangential stresses and, together with R. Giambo', F. Giannoni and P. Piccione, to investigate the nature of the final state for these gravitational collapse models. In the field of archaeoastronomy, Magli has investigated the foundations of the discipline and its relationship with \\"exact\\" sciences, insisting in particular on the possibility for Archaeoastronomy to make \\"predictions\\" - to be tested against facts - as any other scientific discipline can do. These ideas have been applied in particular to the relationship between topography, astronomy and dynastic history in the Egyptian pyramid's fields. In this context Magli proposed an inverse chronology between the two main pyramids of Giza as a consequence of the astronomical data, a theory which - thanks to Juan Belmonte of the IAC - developed in the idea, sustained today by both authors, that the project of the two was conceived together by Khufu in order to actualize his Akhet, symbolic horizon. Using archaeoastronomy arguments, Magli proposed an explanation for the site of the Abusir pyramid's field, as well as a possible location where the missing pyramid of the 6th dynasty king Userkare might have been located. Magli has also investigated the meaning of the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, proposing that it was a pilgrimage center conceived in pair with that of the Island of the Sun on the Titicaca Lake. Magli has also worked together with Robert Hannah on the role of the sun in the original project of the Pantheon. His researches have been frequently reported in press and media releases, and have been the subjects of two CNN documentaries of the \\"Revealer\\" series.

Leninia was first named by Valentin Fischer, Maxim S. Arkhangelsky, Gleb N. Uspensky, Ilya M. Stenshin and Pascal Godefroit in 2013 and the type species is Leninia stellans. It was named for Vladimir Lenin, one of the leaders of the Communist Revolution in Russia, as the museum it is currently housed in is also named for him. The specimen was discovered in 2012, on the banks of the river Volga near the town of Kriushi in a limestone nodule. There are several other fossils from the same time period near it, including ammonites, lamellibranchs and fish remains. Only part of the skull was found.  Features  The skull is incomplete, and without any teeth. it is partially crushed transversely, and nothing further forward than the naris remains, with what seems to be a fairly clean break. It is not known whether this was due to orogeny and rock action or to the ichthyosaur's death. The specimen is around long, which suggests the skull was between long overall. Unusually, the posterior process of the maxilla extends as far back as the orbit, and about halfway along it, possibly even projecting into the orbit at points. The maxillary dental groove is extremely shallow, only deep. The lacrimal-nasal contact is elongated, so that the lacrimal, rather than the prefrontal, forms the posterior edge of the naris. The anterior process and shaft of the jugal are unusually narrow, but the posterior plate is well-developed and extends as high as the middle of the orbit. The postorbital is small compared to the orbit, with a large dorsal orbital rim extending out from the top of the bone. The quadratojugal seems more robust than that of other ophthalmosaurines, but has a thin anterior surface which articulates with the postorbital. There is a concave area which a ligament would connect to the quadrate process. The squamosal is present but incomplete. However, it is possible to tell the shape by the marks where it would have articulated with other bones. Above the naris, the nasal bone forms a conspicuous lateral 'wing'. There is no clear evidence for a foramen near the prefrontal-nasal facet. The prefrontal forms a thick anterior process which has grown over the nasal, unlike in other ophthalmosaurids. Its suture with the lacrimal bone is straight. The frontals are roughly triangular and have the 'internasal' foramen between them (not between the nasals). They have long posterior processes which suture with the forked processes of the parietals in a star shape, hence the specific name stellans. The postfrontal contacts the nasal over a short distance, and as in Ophthalmosaurus, has no Y-shaped anterior process. Uniquely, the postfrontal does not border the supratemporal fenestra, but still forms a long process in contact with the supratemporal. The parietals touch the anteriomedial process of the supratemporals, another autapomorphy. This anteromedial process also blocks the postfrontal from bordering the supratemporal fenestra. The parietals are crushed against one another, but there is no evidence of a crest. The supratemporal is more extensive than in most ophthalmosaurines, but is separated from the postorbital by the postfontal and squamosal bones. Both pterygoids are present but cannot really be seen, and are distorted. The basioccipital is not perfectly preserved, but the extracondylar area is reduced and concave. The occipital condyle is bulbous, but the floor of the foramen magnum is not well preserved enough to be a diagnostic feature. The occipital head of the stapes is largely expanded, with a large hyoid process, but the quadrate head is missing. The quadrate is roughly ear-shaped, with an occipital lamella. Only the posterior end of the lower jaw is preserved, and this lacks any distinctive features, such as teeth. The surangular fossa is present but extremely reduced, and the angular is well exposed laterally. These features, however, are not diagnostic or autapomorphies. Both sclerotic rings are preserved, but the left one is much less distorted. It is composed of 14 trapezoidal plates, with crenulations on the internal edge. The sclerotic aperture is only 11.03% of the orbital area, suggesting that the specimen was fully grown. (All of this section is citing )  Evolutionary importance  Leninia is one of the latest-living ophthalmosaurines, and also one of the most basal. Despite this, it still had the very large sclerotic ring and aperture, suggesting that this was one of the most basal characteristics of ophthalmosaurines and that they were all deep-diving, remaining conservative in this ecological niche during the entire time period that they existed. The absolute size of Leninia's sclerotic ring is among the largest known in ichthyosaurs, with only Baptanodon ('Ophthalmosaurus natans') and the giant Temnodontosaurus exceeding it. As all the ophthalmosaurines had this kind of structure, and were more similar in eye structure than the platypterygines, this suggests that they did not diversify in the same way that the platypterygines did but stayed similar as deep divers, possibly as they were so specialised for deep diving that they were outcompeted in other niches.

Delouze Aerodrome was designed to be the home of four day bombardment squadron, and construction of the Aerodrome did not begin until the middle of April 1918 due to labor shortages, works been done by the 462nd Aero Squadron (Construction), which stayed at Delouze from 29 April to 20 August 1918. Engineers began to erect a total of 26 buildings for barracks and a mess hall, and two additional buildings for maintenance shops. The ground station was built in the woods to the northeast of the airfield, to camouflage the facility. A headquarters complex of ten buildings and a hospital that constituted of a Nissen Hut was erected, along with a telephone and electrical system. To shelter the aircraft, sixteen French Bessonneau aircraft hangars were erected at the field.Series L, Miscellaneous Sections of the Air Service, Volume 11, History of the Design and Projects Section of the Construction Division, Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C.

Their other hits include \\"Imagination\\", \\"Stop (Falling Down)\\", \\"Kiss\\", \\"Girls\\", \\"You and I\\", and \\"Unbreakable\\". History The duo was formed in autumn 2003 by two radio DJs, Krzysztof Kalwat (Kalwi) and Remigiusz Po≈õpiech (Remi). In July 2004, they performed as opening act for Ti√´sto in Poland. In June 2005, they released their first DJ mix album, Kalwi & Remi in the Mix Vol. 1, which included remixes of songs by other artists as well as two of their own tracks, \\"El Ninio\\" and \\"Explosion\\". The double A-side vinyl single \\"IndepenDance\\"/\\"Explosion\\" reached no. 8 on the official techno/trance DJ chart in Switzerland in early 2006. Growing popularity of the remixed version of \\"Explosion\\" in Polish clubs caught the attention of the label My Music which released Kalwi & Remi's first album of original material, Always in Trance, in April 2006. The song was a breakthrough in their career, achieving commercial success not only in Poland, but also abroad. Judge Jules played it on his BBC Radio 1 show and the video was a hit on Canadian dance music channel bpm:tv. In October, the duo performed a DJ set in Hammersmith Palais in London supporting Sonique, and released the second DJ mix album, Kalwi & Remi and Friends Vol. 2, which included their new hit \\"Imagination\\". In late 2006, they started hosting their own weekly show on Radio Eska. Their next single was \\"Victory\\", a homage to the football club Lech Pozna≈Ñ, which sampled the \\"UEFA Champions League Anthem\\". The track was included on their next DJ compilation album in 2007, Electro, which also featured \\"Made in USA\\". The duo performed to much success in Poland, Europe, and the US, and Ministry of Sound invited them to perform in clubs across England. In September 2007, they also played a DJ set at a festival in Dubai. In November, Kalwi & Remi released another DJ mix compilation, 4Play, which consisted of 2 CDs and featured \\"ADHD\\", their collaboration with Judge Jules. In 2009, the duo presented their song \\"Lips\\", recorded with Polish singer Gosia Andrzejewicz, at the Midem festival in Cannes. Later that year, they released singles \\"Stop (Falling Down)\\" and \\"Find You\\" which became hits in Poland. In 2010, they participated in Bydgoszcz Hit Festiwal with the song \\"Kiss\\" where they placed fifth. They teamed up with Afrika Islam (Mr. X) for the song \\"Girls\\" which was a club and radio hit in Poland. The single was followed by their second album of original material, Kiss Me Girl, released in April 2011. It included the single \\"You and I\\" recorded with Amanda Wilson which was another international hit. The song peaked in the top 40 of the Polish club chart and reached no. 1 on the Polish TV airplay chart. It also entered the official singles chart in Bulgaria. In 2013, Kalwi & Remi released \\"Pragnƒô ciƒô\\", a Polish-language song which was another top 40 hit on the club chart in Poland. They teamed up with Amanda Wilson again for the English version of the track, \\"I Need You\\". In 2016, the duo released a Polish-language, tropical house-influenced single \\"Daj mi klapsa\\" (\\"Spank Me\\") which featured sexually-charged lyrics. The song received overwhelmingly negative opinions which criticized its lyrical content and production, and the accompanying erotic music video gathered over eight times as many \\"dislikes\\" as \\"likes\\" on YouTube within the first week of publication. Nonetheless, their 2018 single \\"Unbreakable\\" was met with a much bigger success, entering radio hit lists and the top 20 of the Polish club chart.

It was formerly approved as a virotherapy medication by the State Agency of Medicines of the Republic of Latvia (2004‚Äì19). In March 2019, the distribution in Latvia was stopped by the State Agency of Medicines, after laboratory tests found that the amount of ECHO-7 virus was in much smaller amounts than claimed. On May 31, 2019, the State Agency of Medicines suspended the registration licence of ECHO-7. History The potential use of echovirus as an oncolytic virus to treat cancer was discovered by Latvian scientist and immunologist Aina Muceniece in the 1960s and 1970s. The virus was obtained from intestinal tract of a healthy children and has not been genetically modified. She was an honorary member of the Latvian Association of Oncologists and the founder of The Aina Muceniece Virotherapy Foundation. Approval The data used to register the drug in Latvia is not sufficient to obtain approval to use it in the US, Europe, or Japan. As of 2017 there was no good evidence that ECHO-7 is an effective cancer treatment. Oncologists and other medical experts in Latvia have repeatedly expressed the concern for the lack of clinical trials and evidence of efficacy, as well as unethical advertising. Oncologist David Gorski has written that \\"There are many aspects to the RIGVIR story that strongly suggest that RIGVIR is probably cancer quackery\\" citing the \\"mysterious creator\\" aspect, the misleading description of the product as \\"natural\\" and the use of testimonials to market it. In February 2017, the Association of Oncologists, Association of Chemotherapists, Association of Rare Diseases of Latvia, and the Head of Pharmacology Department of Riga Stradi≈Ü≈° University submitted a request to the Ministry of Health of Latvia, State Agency of Medicines, and National Health Service requesting the removal of ECHO-7 from the Register of Medicines of Latvia and from the list of state- compensated medicines. A revision of clinical treatment guidelines for melanoma was also requested. The request was based on the analysis of available research and suggests that there is no conclusive evidence for the efficacy of RIGVIR as a cancer treatment. In 2017 the Health Ministry of Latvia responded that RIGVIR would remain on its medicines register, and that in its judgement the risk-benefit ratio for RIGVIR as acceptable. At the end of 2018, Commission of Social and Labor Affairs of Latvian Parliament started a discussion about possible exclusion of RIGVIR from the list of state- compensated medicines and the Register of Medicines of Latvia. On March 19, 2019, the manufacturer of ECHO-7, SIA LATIMA, announced the drug's removal from sale in Latvia, quoting financial and strategic reasons and insufficient profitability. However, several days later an investigative TV show revealed that State Agency of Medicines had run laboratory tests on the vials, and found that the amount of ECHO-7 virus is of a much smaller amount than claimed by the manufacturer. According to agency's lab director, \\"It's like buying what you think is lemon juice, but finding that what you have is lemon- flavored water\\". In March 2019, the distribution of ECHO-7 in Latvia has been stopped. ECHO-7 has also been removed from the list of state-reimbursed medications. On May 31, 2019, the registration licence of ECHO-7 was suspended in Latvia. According to Baltic News Network, \\"State Agency for Medicines (SAM) has decided to halts registration of Rigvir medication, until all problems have been resolved\\". It also reported \\"more than 30 patients, five healthcare institutions and 16 oncologists have turned to the Health Inspectorate with a request to permit them to continue therapy using Rigvir. In response to requests, HI permitted distribution of a single type of Rigvir medication for patients, who are already undergoing melanoma treatment\\".. According to a case study published by the European Journal of Pharmacology, \\"Rigvir as an immunomodulator with anti-tumor effect was approved and registered for treatment of melanoma, local treatment of skin and subcutaneous metastases of melanoma, for prevention of re-lapse and metastasis after radical surgery. Rigvir is an oncolytic virus belonging to the Picorna-viridae family, Enterovirus genus, ECHO group, type 7, that has not been genetically modified but has been selected and adapted for melanoma\\". According to Solvita Olsena, expert in patient safety at the University of Latvia, people who have used ECHO-7 should contact the police, as facts indicate that a criminal offence has occurred. According to Olsena, police has the duty to protect people; it is a dangerous precedent when people receive medicines that do not contain the substance which should be present. A member of Latvian parliament and advisor to the Prime Minister, Renars Putnins, also has called the entire thing an affair and has asked for an official investigation. Advertising In Latvia manufacturers of ECHO-7 have a history of receiving fines for off- label marketing this anti-cancer drug directly to general public and cancer patients. However, on October 31, 2018 the Regional Administrative Court of Latvia canceled the sanction imposed by the local Health Inspectorate for the unauthorized off-label advertising.

It was designed by Edward Welby Pugin and is under the administration of the Diocese of Lancaster. It is near to Preston city centre and stands on the corner of the A6, between Aqueduct Street and St George's Road. Since 2017, it has been in the care of priests from the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest.\\"Traditionalist institute saves second church in Preston\\" from Catholic Herald, 10 July 2017, accessed 16 July 2017 History=Gallow's Hill= English Martyrs Church is built on the site of an area that used to be called Gallows Hill. It received that name after the Battle of Preston of the Jacobite rising of 1715. After the government overcame the rebel army, it was on Gallows Hill that the rebel prisoners were executed. On 5 January 1715, it was recorded that sixteen rebels 'were hanged upon Gallows Hill, for high treason and conspiracy.'Preston from Lancashire OnLine Parish Clerks, accessed 2 February 2013 In May 1817, evidence of this was found when the area was dug up to improve the road heading north (the A6 road), and two coffins were found containing the remains of two headless bodies. A brass hand axe was also unearthed, with portions of timber which were assumed to be part of the gallows.History from EnglishMartyrsPreston.org, accessed 2 February 2013 =Wren's Cottage= In 1864, when the English Martyrs mission was founded, the Diocese of Lancaster did not yet exist. Instead, it was the then Bishop of Liverpool who served the Catholic churches in Preston. In 1864, Bishop Alexander Goss sent Fr James Taylor to a house called Wren's Cottage. The cottage was a quarter of mile north of the present church. The house was made available for the priest and the stable was converted into a chapel. The first Mass was said there on 25 December 1864 and it was officially opened on 22 January 1865. =Building= As the chapel was only temporary and could fit 145 people, plans were drawn up to build a church that could accommodate a larger congregation. It was agreed when Wren's Cottage was bought that a church would not be built on the site, so the Corporation of Preston sold the land around Gallows Hill for the construction of the church. On 26 May 1866, Bishop Goss laid the foundation stone for the church. It was designed by Edward Welby Pugin, the eldest son of Augustus Pugin. The church was initially meant to have a spire, but a lack of funds prevented it from being built. On 1 December 1867, the church was officially opened by Bishop Goss with the assistance of the Bishop of Nottingham, Richard Roskell. =Enlargement= The church after E. W. Pugin's extension. The presbytery is to the left of the church In 1874, Fr James Taylor left and was replaced by Fr Joseph A. Pyke. In 1886, he became rector of the church and immediately sought a solution to accommodating the increasing church congregation. He decided that the church needed to be enlarged so he brought in Edward Welby Pugin again to design an extension to the church. The new plans added two new bays to the nave and aisles, a new chancel, two transepts, chapels, two additional confessionals, sacristies, and a room for meetings. An entrance was to be provided from St. George's Road to the south transept by a porch. The nave was to be divided from the chancel by an arch. The estimated cost of the extension was about ¬£8,000. The foundation stone of the new buildings was laid by the Bishop of Liverpool Bernard O'Reilly in 1887, and building work was finished in 1888. On 8 February 1888, there was a solemn re- opening of the church. There were many church dignitaries present at the ceremony such as Bishop O'Reilly, Auxiliary Bishop Donnelly of Dublin, Bishop MacDonald of Argyll and the Isles, Bishop Hedley of Newport and Menevia, Bishop Knight of Shrewsbury, Bishop Vaughan of Salford and Bishop Lacy of Middlesbrough. In 1902, Fr Pyke and was succeeded by his nephew, Fr Edward J. Pyke. During his time at the church, he worked to remove the debts that the church had accumulated from its construction and extension. Furthermore, he oversaw the handling of the parish, the nearby Catholic schools and the consecration of the church. On 14 September 1921, the church was consecrated in a ceremony presided over by the Archbishop of Liverpool, Frederick Keating, with assistance from Bishop Casartelli of Salford, Bishop Cowgill of Leeds, Bishop Singleton of Shrewsbury and Auxiliary Bishop Vaughan of Salford. =21st century= In 2012, the presbytery adjacent to the church was sold to L'Arche a nearby charity that houses communities for those with learning disabilities. The furniture and paintings in the house were auctioned off, including Gothic style furniture from the time of the church's construction in the 1860s and 1880s. The auction also featured a selection of oil paintings on canvas depicting martyrs, saints and other religious scenes, six watercolour scenes by Preston artist Edwin Beattie, brass candlesticks and ornamental crucifixes.Church‚Äôs Gothic furniture to be sold in Clitheroe from The Clitheroe Advertiser and Times 2 February 2013 On 11 July 2017, the Bishop of Lancaster, Michael Campbell announced that the church and parish would be entrusted to the care of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest.

It is not clear what occasion it was composed for, and it has been confused with the Waisenhausmesse, composed in the same year. Religious music at the time was increasingly influenced by opera and Baroque embellishments in instrumentation; Mozart's early masses, such as K. 49/47d, have been seen as a return to the more austere settings of the pre- Baroque era.

The school building was the temporary headquarters of the Genoa Social Forum, led by Vittorio Agnoletto. A nearby building, housing the anti-globalization organization Indymedia and lawyers affiliated with the Genoa Social Forum, was also raided. On July 21, 2001, shortly before midnight, mobile divisions of the Polizia di Stato of Genoa, Rome and Milan attacked the buildings, with the operational support of some battalions of the Carabinieri. The police indiscriminately attacked the building's occupants, resulting in the arrest of 93 protesters; 61 were seriously injured and were taken to hospital, three of them were in a critical condition and one in a coma. Prisoners taken to a temporary detention facility in Bolzaneto were tortured and humiliated before being released. The raid resulted in the trial of 125 policemen, including managers and supervisors, for what was termed a beating from \\"Mexican butchery\\" by the assistant chief Michelangelo Fournier. However, none of the accused police officers was punished, due to delays in the investigation and incompleteness of Italian laws under which torture was not recognised as a crime in 2001. Prior to the raid, there had been several clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Several protesters were sleeping in the school. The numbers and designation of the security forces involved in the raid are still unknown, as they wore ski masks to hide their identities. The Court of Appeal of Genoa stated that \\"346 policemen, in addition to 149 Carabinieri officers were involved in the raid of the school buildings.\\" The raid is the subject of the 2012 film Diaz ‚Äì Don't Clean Up This Blood where the attack and subsequent torture of detainees is recreated. On April 7, 2015, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Italy had violated the European Convention on Human Rights at the 2001 G8 and ordered compensation for a protester beaten by the police. Earlier, the Italian government compensated a British journalist who had been beaten by the police. Amnesty International defined the raid as \\"the most serious human rights suspension in Europe, after World War II.G8 di Genova, i 4 giorni dell‚ÄôItalia senza democrazia.

The raid was initiated by mobile police units from Rome, followed by more units from Genoa and Milan. Battalions of the Carabinieri did not actively participate in the raid, but limited themselves to surround the perimeter and areas adjacent to the school. Mark Covell, a British journalist, was the first person who met the police outside the building and was assaulted, leaving him in a coma.Briton beaten by Genoa police wins ‚Ç¨350,000 compensation.

During the raid the police violently attacked those who were in the school, injuring 82 people out of a total of 93 arrested. Among the arrested, 63 were taken to hospital and 19 were taken to the police station of Bolzaneto. According to the reconstruction of events given in subsequent investigations, evidence was planted after the raid to justify the brutality of the raid. Senior police officers planted two Molotov cocktails recovered elsewhere in the school, delivered to them by General Valerio Donnini that afternoon. La sentenza sulla scuola Diaz.

Police also planted construction tools, hammers and knives from a nearby construction site and claimed they belonged to anarchist groups housed in the building. A police officer, Massimo Nucera, showed a slash in his bulletproof vest, claiming he was knifed by a violent demonstrator. However, the knife was never identified. He was later convicted of forgery and defamation, and it was later revealed that he cut his own vest to claim resistors were violent, and thus justify the brutality of the raid.‚ÄúMacelleria‚Äù G-8. Troppi silenzi e omert√†. La grande voglia di archiviare. By Valter Vecellio. Articolo 21 . =Beginning of the raid= The raid started a few minutes before midnight, when policemen massed outside the school. A police officer attacked British journalist Mark Covell, who tried to tell them he was a journalist. Within seconds, more policemen joined in the attack, beating him with nightsticks to the ground. According to Covell, one policeman kicked him in the chest, breaking half-a-dozen ribs whose splintered ends then shredded the membrane of his left lung, and laughed. Other policemen kicked him around, breaking his hand and damaging his spine. The police then used an armoured police van to break through the school gates and 150 policemen, wearing crash helmets and carrying truncheons and shields, entered the school compound. =Nature of police action during the raid= Blood on the walls of the school after the raid. (Indymedia) For the raid, police wore masks to hinder identification. Most occupants of the building were in their sleeping bags, and many raised their arms in surrender when they realised the police were breaking into the building. However, police attacked the crowds with truncheons, beating everyone indiscriminately. A 65-year-old woman's arm was broken. Melanie Jonasch, a 28-year-old archaeology student from Berlin, was attacked by officers set upon her, beating her head so hard that she rapidly lost consciousness. When she fell to the ground, officers circled her, beating and kicking her limp body, banging her head against a nearby cupboard, leaving her in a pool of blood.The bloody battle of Genoa. By Nick Davies. The Guardian, 17 July 2008. All occupants of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to lie down on the ground to show that they offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group of young men and women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the occupants of the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust it into her face. Another who paused amid the beatings and took a knife to cut off hair from his victims, including Nicola Doherty; the constant shouting of insults; the officer who asked a group if they were OK and who reacted to the one who said \\"No\\" by handing out an extra beating. A few escaped, at least for a while. Karl Boro made it up on to the roof but then made the mistake of coming back into the building, where he was treated to heavy bruising to his arms and legs, a fractured skull, and bleeding in his chest cavity. Jaroslaw Engel, from Poland, managed to use builders' scaffolding to get out of the school, but he was caught in the street by some police drivers who smashed him over the head, laid him on the ground and stood over him smoking while his blood ran out across the tarmac. Police officers found a fire extinguisher and squirted its foam into the wounds of an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners from all over the building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district. =Treatment of prisoners at Bolzaneto= Prisoners at the temporary detention facility in Bolzaneto were forced to say \\"Viva il duce.\\" and sing fascist songs: \\"Un, due, tre. Viva Pinochet!\\" The 222 people who were held at Bolzaneto were treated to a regime later described by public prosecutors as torture. On arrival, they were marked with felt-tip crosses on each cheek, and many were forced to walk between two parallel lines of officers who kicked and beat them. Most were herded into large cells, holding up to 30 people. Here, they were forced to stand for long periods, facing the wall with their hands up high and their legs spread. Those who failed to hold the position were shouted at, slapped and beaten. A prisoner with an artificial leg and, unable to hold the stress position, collapsed and was rewarded with two bursts of pepper spray in his face and, later, a particularly savage beating. Prisoners who answered back were met with violence. One of them, Stefan Bauer answered a question from a German- speaking guard and said he was from the European Union and he had the right to go where he wanted. He was hauled out, beaten, sprayed with pepper spray, stripped naked and put under a cold shower. His clothes were taken away and he was returned to the freezing cell wearing only a flimsy hospital gown. The detainees were given few or no blankets, kept awake by guards, given little or no food and denied their statutory right to make phone calls and see a lawyer. They could hear crying and screaming from other cells. Police doctors at the facility also participated in the torture, using ritual humiliation, threats of rape and deprivation of water, food, sleep and medical care. A prisoner named Richard Moth was given stitches in his head and legs without anaesthetics, which made the procedure painful. Men and women with dreadlocks had their hair roughly cut off to the scalp. One detainee, Marco Bistacchia was taken to an office, stripped naked, made to get down on all fours and told to bark like a dog and to shout \\"Viva la polizia Italiana!\\" He was sobbing too much to obey. An unnamed officer told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he had seen police officers urinating on prisoners and beating them for refusing to sing Faccetta Nera, a Mussolini-era fascist song. Ester Percivati, a young Turkish woman, recalled guards calling her a whore as she was marched to the toilet, where a woman officer forced her head down into the bowl and a male jeered \\"Nice arse! Would you like a truncheon up it?\\" Several women reported threats of rape. Finally, the police forced their captives to sign statements, waiving all their legal rights. One man, David Larroquelle, testified that he refused to sign the statements. Police broke three of his ribs for his disobedience. Media and government reactions The British journalist Covell was photographed with his wounds immediately after the raid by Daily Mail journalist Lucie Morris, who bribed Italian police to approach him. Soon afterward, the Daily Mail wrote a story accusing Covell of helping mastermind the riots. Covell contended the story was false, but was in no financial position to sue for libel. However, he was able to get legal aid to sue for invasion of privacy. Covell argued that under the Convention on Human Rights and the Italian constitution, he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his hospital room, and Morris breached it by entering his room under false pretense. The Mail initially stood by its reporting. However, when it became apparent that the paper stood no chance in court, it agreed to pay damages to Covell and reimburse him for his legal expenses. Managing editor Charles Garside also wrote a private letter of apology to Covell. While his citizens were being beaten and tormented in illegal detention, spokesmen for the then prime minister, Tony Blair, declared: \\"The Italian police had a difficult job to do. The prime minister believes that they did that job.\\" Blair's refusal to criticise police violence was condemned by British protesters on their expulsion from Italy. While the bloody bodies were being carried out of the Diaz Pertini building on stretchers, police told reporters that the ambulances lined up in the street were nothing to do with the raid. They also claimed that the school building was being used as a makeshift hospital by anarchists who had attacked policemen, and many of the injured in the building had pre-existing injuries. The next day, senior officers held a press conference at which they announced that everybody in the building would be charged with aggressive resistance to arrest and conspiracy to cause destruction. Later, Italian courts dismissed all charges against everyone. At the same press conference, police displayed an array of what they described as weaponry. This included crowbars, hammers and nails which they themselves had taken from a builder's store next to the school; aluminium rucksack frames, which they presented as offensive weapons; 17 cameras; 13 pairs of swimming goggles; 10 pen-knives; and a bottle of sun-tan lotion. They also displayed two Molotov cocktails which had been found by police earlier in the day in another part of the city and planted in the Diaz Pertini building as the raid ended. Attack on the Indymedia building On the night of the raid, a force of 59 police entered the building opposite the Diaz Pertini, where Covell and others had been running their Indymedia centre and where, crucially, a group of lawyers had been based, gathering evidence about police attacks on the earlier demonstrations. Officers went into the lawyers' room, threatened the occupants, smashed their computers and seized hard drives. They also removed anything containing photographs or video tape. Investigations and judicial action Fifteen Italian police officers and doctors were sentenced to jail for brutally mistreating detainees at the Bolzaneto holding camp. However, none of them actually served prison terms because the convictions and sentences were wiped out by a statute of limitations. Those found guilty, including the camp commander, Biagio Gugliotta, were given jail sentences ranging from five months to five years. However, none served any portion of their sentence. While the verdict did not lead to the punishment of the offenders, it did help victims claim compensation. Since torture is not present in Italy‚Äôs code, officers alleged to have tortured demonstrators have never been charged with torture. On September 21, 2012, the Italian interior ministry awarded Mark Cowell ‚Ç¨350,000 (¬£280,000 or US$454,265) in an out-of- court settlement. Cowell had suffered broken ribs, smashed teeth and a shredded lung in the attack, and had spent the better part of a decade traveling between the UK and Italy to pursue his case. In return, he dropped his Court of Human Rights case against the Italian government. On April 7, 2015, the European Court of Human Rights condemned Italy for the violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Cestaro v. Italy trial and found the Italian legislation against torture to be inadequate. The European Court of Human Rights on 22 June 2017 ruled that the italian police involved in the raid and subsequent detention were guilty of torture, denouncing what it called a \\"particularly serious and cruel\\" police raid. The state of Italy was ordered to pay damages to the victims in the order of 45 000 - 55 000 EUR each. .

Early life Arnold Cazenove was born on 18 September 1898, the third son of Arthur Philip Cazenove of Cadogan Place, London, of a junior branch of the Cazenoves of Cottesbrooke. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.Burke's. Military career In 1916, during World War I, Cazenove passed out of Sandhursthttp://archive.sandhurstcollection.org.uk/view/5805/110736/ and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coldstream Guards, in which he served on the Western Front in 1917‚Äì18. He was mentioned in despatches.Who was Who Cazenove served as the adjutant of the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, in 1922‚Äì25, and was on the staff of London District 1926‚Äì29. He was promoted to major in 1933 and held the appointments of brigade major to the Brigade of Guards (1933‚Äì36) and Officer Commanding Guards Depot (1937). In 1939 he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and took command of the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards. In September 1939, during World War II, the battalion, part of the 7th Guards Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, under Major General Bernard Montgomery, was sent to France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). During the German invasion of France and Belgium in May 1940, the battalion fought in the delaying actions along the Ypres-Comines Canal and was then evacuated from Dunkirk.Joslen, p. 243. The 3rd Infantry Division was the first formation of the BEF to be re-equipped to man the defences of Southeast England.Horrocks, pp. 80‚Äì5, 93Montgomery, pp. 61‚Äì2, 67‚Äì8. Later that summer (18 August), Cazenove was appointed to command of the 7th Guards Brigade with the rank of temporary brigadier. On 15 September 1941, his headquarters was redesignated Headquarters Guards Support Group (a mainly artillery formation supporting the Guards Armoured Division) and the 7th Guards Brigade ceased to exist. Cazenove continued in command until 10 October when he could be replaced by an artillery officer.Joslen, p. 214. Cazenove was next appointed commander of the 73rd Independent Infantry Brigade from 10 October, and commander of Cornwall Coastal Area in addition from 30 November 1941. He thus had the dual role of commanding field force units for a mobile role and static units for defence of vulnerable points. In December 1942 the 73rd Brigade lost its infantry battalions and was simply designated Cornwall Coastal Area.Joslen, p. 304 Next, Cazenove commanded 140th (4th London) Brigade in 47th (London) Infantry Division, a reserve formation, from 13 April 1943 until 31 August 1944 when it was disbanded.Joslen, p. 235. For his war service, Cazenove had been mentioned in despatches, awarded the American Legion of Merit, and made a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau. He was Deputy Commander of Aldershot District from 1947 to 1950, was promoted to substantive brigadier in 1948, and retired in 1950.

It was one of the series of Aldwych farces that ran at the Aldwych Theatre in London nearly continuously from 1923 to 1933. The play centres on a breach of promise case brought before a British court of justice. The piece opened on 24 November 1930 and ran until 16 May 1931, a total of 195 performances.\\"Mr. Ralph Lynn\\", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11 The actor-manager Tom Walls, who presented the farces and co-starred in most of them, gathered a regular company of players for the series.

The first four in the series, It Pays to Advertise, A Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook and Thark had long runs, averaging more than 400 performances each. The next three were less outstandingly successful, with progressively shorter runs: Plunder (1928) ran for 344 performances, A Cup of Kindness (1929) for 291, and A Night Like This (1930), 267. Like its predecessors, the play was directed by Tom Walls, who co-starred with Ralph Lynn, a specialist in playing \\"silly ass\\" characters. The regular company of supporting actors included Robertson Hare, who played a figure of harassed respectability; Mary Brough in eccentric old lady roles; Ethel Coleridge as the severe voice of authority; Winifred Shotter as the sprightly young female lead; and the saturnine Gordon James.Trussler, p. 278Travers, p. vi Original cast *Banks ‚Äì George Barrett *Jane Elliott ‚Äì Doreen Bendix *Mrs Elliott ‚Äì Ethel Coleridge *Walford Gibbs ‚Äì Ralph Lynn *Mrs Chattaway ‚Äì Mary Brough *Cyril Chattaway ‚Äì Denis O'Neil *Hugh Delafield ‚Äì Tom Walls *Doris Chattaway ‚Äì Winifred Shotter *Sergeant Burrows ‚Äì Philip Carlton *Sir Anthony Plumstead ‚Äì Gordon James *Mr Justice Sparrowhawk ‚Äì Robertson Hare *Mervyn Parkes ‚Äì Archibald Batty Synopsis ;Act I ‚Äì Wally Gibbs's rooms in Staple Inn. Afternoon Wally hopes to marry Jane Elliott. He seeks Mrs Elliott's approval, which she gives, though shrewdly assessing his playboy character. When Wally is alone, Mrs Chattaway is shown in. She accuses him of playing fast and loose with the affections of her daughter Doris. He admits that they have been on romantic terms, but denies that he ever asked Doris to marry him. Mrs Chattaway departs, threatening him with an action for breach of promise. Wally's best friend, Hugh, arrives. He is a barrister, but not a prosperous one, preferring to go to the races than appear in court. Unlike the equally idle Wally he has no private income. He too loves Jane, but magnanimously congratulates his friend on being the victor in the contest for her love. Wally tells Hugh about Mrs Chattaway's threats. The solution, he feels, is for Hugh to charm Doris and lure her affections away from Wally. He emphasises that Doris is a very attractive and genuinely nice young woman. Hugh reluctantly agrees. They spin Doris a yarn that he is desolate after a broken engagement and in need of consolation. He borrows Wally's car to take her for a drive in the country. ;Act II ‚Äì The same, the next morning Mrs Chattaway intrudes again, accompanied by her son. Doris has not been home overnight, and they accuse of Wally of abducting her. He allows them to search his rooms, and they depart, threatening to call in the police. Hugh and Doris enter. While they were having dinner in a country pub Wally's car was stolen. It was too late to come back to London by train, and they took a room each at the pub. Wally is greatly agitated, expressing concern for Doris's reputation. It is clear that she will suffer at the hands of her bullying mother if it emerges that she has been out overnight with a man she has just met. Mrs Chattaway returns; they try to bluff things out, but a police inspector arrives to report the finding of Wally's car. He hands over a vanity bag found in the vehicle, which Mrs Chattaway recognises as Doris's. She assumes it was Wally, not Hugh, who took Doris for a ride. Jane enters, encounters Doris, and leaps to the same conclusion as Mrs Chattaway. She breaks off the engagement and leaves. Hugh's brother-in-law, a prosperous solicitor to whom he owes money, arrives in search of him. He insists that Hugh should accept a lucrative brief to appear for the plaintiff in a breach of promise case. Hugh looks at the brief and announces in dismay that the plaintiff's name is Doris Chattaway. ;Act III ‚Äì The Law Courts Before the trial begins Wally and Doris confer privately. Each expresses a warm regard for the other, and it is clear that the case has been brought entirely under pressure from Mrs Chattaway. The trial begins, presided over by a judge who makes dreadful jokes throughout. Hugh outlines the case against Wally, painting a deeply unflattering picture of his character. Cross- examined, Wally says that though he never proposed marriage to Doris he might have done had it not been for her mother. Hugh reads aloud from some of Wally's love letters to Doris, which are so twee as to have Wally cowering below the top of the witness box from embarrassment. Hugh and Wally engage in mutual acrimony that verges on contempt of court. Wally announces to the court in general and Hugh in particular that he did not realise how much Doris meant to him until the night Hugh took her away. The judge tries to restore order, but is shouted down by Wally and Hugh. Wally proposes in open court to Doris, who accepts; Hugh counters by revealing that he has married Jane. The hullabaloo in court engulfs the hapless judge and even the incandescent Mrs Chattaway, as each character expresses his or her enthusiasm or outrage. Critical reception There was a general view among the critics that although the third act was exceptionally funny, the first two were slow, with some good comic scenes but also quite a lot of not particularly amusing exposition of the plot.\\"Marry The Girl\\", The Observer, 30 November 1930, p. 13 The Times said, \\"But the Court scene, though it could make no claim to originality, was good fun from beginning to end. Mr Hare, as the presiding Judge, had the best of it but the inanity of Mr Lynn in the witness box was extremely felicitous.\\"\\"Aldwych Theatre\\", The Times, 25 November 1930, p. 12 The Illustrated London News predicted a run of more than 100 nights, but \\"the credit for this will be due to the actors rather than the authors, who have not been lavish in their wit or in inventing notably original or humorous situations\\".\\"The Playhouses\\", The Illustrated London News, 6 December 1930, p. 1046 The paper added that the last act was extremely funny and sent the audience from the theatre shaking with laughter. Adaptations The play was filmed in 1935. Marry the Girl was unlike the nine earlier film versions of the Aldwych series in several respects: it was made by a different company (British Lion Films rather than British & Dominions Film Corporation and Gaumont British);\\"Tom Walls\\" British Film Institute, accessed 3 March 2013 it was not directed by Walls, who had directed eight of the first nine;Walls directed all except Just My Luck (1933), which was directed by Jack Raymond and neither Walls, Lynn nor Hare featured in it: the only member of the original stage cast who appeared was Winifred Shotter, reprising her stage role as Doris.\\"Marry the Girl\\", British Film Institute, accessed 3 March 2013 NotesReferences  1930 plays Aldwych farce British plays adapted into films Comedy plays ","title":"Marry the Girl (play)"},{"id":"38685605","text":"Lynch Glacier lies to the north and northwest of Mount Daniel, in the U.S. state of Washington.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on May 23, 1959 and features Elmer Fudd. The story concerns Elmer's dog, \\"Wover\\", who, after watching a television show about dogs, is determined to protest how he is treated, but after going hunting, every intention to hurt or kill Elmer backfires on him...in a good way. Plot While Elmer goes to work for half a day one Saturday morning, Wover turns on his favorite TV show, \\"The Dog Lovers Hour\\". The subject matter of the day deals with the relationship between dog and master, with host Carlton Canine asking Wover (rhetorically) whether he was one of those dogs who is forced to sleep in a cold doghouse while his master sleeps in his warm bed. Also pointing out that after a dog has worn out his usefulness, often when he and his master go out hunting, \\"two go out...but only one comes back\\". Plenty enraged by these notions, Wover throws Elmer's framed picture on the floor and stomps on it. Then he boots Elmer in the backside when he comes home, \\"brings\\" him his slippers, deposits them in a trash can and spits on them afterwards, and then jumps up on the bed in defiance, growling at Elmer when confronted about it. Elmer kicks him out of the house as punishment. After some thought, Elmer concludes that Wover's erratic behavior is due to the fact that he hasn't taken him anywhere for a long time and decides he and Wover are going to go hunting. However, Wover is afraid to go ahead of Elmer to kick up some game, because of his fear of Canine's earlier \\"two go out, but only one comes back\\" statement he expressed on television earlier. Despite this, Wover becomes determined to be \\"the one who comes back\\", through a series of mishaps he engineers to harm his master and guarantee his own safety. First Wover disappears, and when Elmer wanders around looking for him, he grabs Elmer's rifle and tries to shoot him, but ends up killing a bear in a cave Elmer crosses the entrance of, prompting him to think Wover saved his life, but is unable to find him to praise him. Wover then tries to have a mail-order animal, the \\"Acme Wild Cat\\", attack Elmer, but Wover gets attacked instead. (This is one of the two Looney Tunes shorts with the wild cat in it who attacks the person who freed it rather than its intended target.) The hapless and naive Elmer sees the injured Wover and praises him for being heroic on both accounts, but Wover still isn't buying it. In a last ditch effort, Wover plants dynamite in the ground, but it fails to detonate when he triggers it, so he pushes Elmer out of the way, then finds the loose wires, connects them, and it blows up on him. Elmer praises him again for saving him, telling him he'll see that he gets a medal for his heroism. Finally won over, Wover feels like a heel and stops the attempts on his master's life. After they go home, Elmer makes the injured pet comfortable on the couch, turns on the TV and goes to get him some milk. \\"The Dog Lovers Hour\\" comes on again, and Wover, incensed by the events of the day, further fueled by Canine's propagandism, gets off the couch and limps to the studio (as he has one hind leg in a cast). Elmer arrives back in the living room just in time to witness Wover attacking Canine on television, as the short ends.

Pakistan In 1965, the Pakistan Navy was given authorization by the Ministry of Defense to award the contract to the Italian shipbuilding company, the Cos.Mo.S., designed the SX-404-class midget submarine for the purposes of the diver propulsion vehicle in 1965. The SX-404 submarine program had a strong preference over the that was being built in France but there were severe problems encountered when the torpedo required according to the Pakistan Navy's standard could not be compatible with the SX-404 design. The SX-404 class were some of the smallest submarines in the world at the time, but could still carry twelve passengers, making them invaluable for raids and reconnaissance in shallow water. The SX-404-class submarines were intended to be use as the diver propulsion vehicle for the SEAL Teams in the Navy Special Service Group, and were delivered in September of 1971 but there were problems encountered providing the cover for the Hangor-class submarines (the motherships) continued until these problems were resolved in December of 1971.

Silver Oak was established in 1972 by Ray Duncan and Justin Meyer. It is currently operated by Ray's sons David Duncan, who serves as the President and CEO, and his brother, Tim Duncan, who serves as Executive Vice President. Silver Oak has two wineries; one in Oakville in the Napa Valley and one in Healdsburg in the Alexander Valley. The Duncan Family also established Twomey Cellars in 1999, which has wineries in Calistoga and Healdsburg. In 2007, the ColoradoBiz cited Silver Oak as one of a dozen California wineries which \\"have reached cult status\\" for its Cabernet Sauvignon production and occupies an \\"important niche in California's wine industry.\\" In 2016, Silver Oak's Oakville winery became the first commercial winery in the world to earn the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum Certification for efficient energy use; their Alexander Valley winery was also granted the certification in the \\"new building\\" category in 2018. History Silver Oak was the vision of Justin Meyer. Entrepreneur and oil entrepreneur, Ray Duncan had purchased Franciscan Vineyards and approached Justin Meyer, whom he‚Äôd met through mutual friends, and asked him to plant and manage his vineyards and winery. While working at Christian Brothers, Justin agreed, and started Silver Oak on the side. Ray invested in Meyer and Silver Oak was established in 1972. Named after its location between Oakville and the Silverado Trail in Napa Valley, Justin and Ray's vision for Silver Oak was to devote all their resources to producing a single wine and Justin's favorite focus - Cabernet Sauvignon. Justin's vision was to perfect and make a wine that was 100% Cabernet, no blending. Founders, Ray Duncan and Justin Meyer In 1972, Ray purchased a dairy farm in Oakville, in the Napa Valley, which is the site where the Silver Oak Napa Valley winery stands today. It was on this dairy farm in 1972 where Silver Oak's first vintage was produced using grapes from Silver Oak's Alexander Valley vineyards. That same year, Ray and Justin began planting Silver Oak's first Napa Valley vineyard. Seven years later, Silver Oak harvested the grapes for the company's first Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. Silver Oak produced 1,600 cases of 1972 North Coast Cabernet Sauvignon, Silver Oak's first wine. However, according to David Duncan, quoted in 2007, the company didn't sell wine for the first five years but then sold out for 28 years consecutively, and the company has continued to grow. In 1981, on the site of the old dairy farm in Oakville, Silver Oak broke ground on their Napa Valley winery which was completed in 1982. Growth of the company from 1977 onwards enabled Silver Oak to purchase further vineyards in the 1980s and early 1990s, becoming one of the most successful Cabernet Sauvignon brands of the 1980s. In 1994, Justin Meyer brought on Daniel Baron to become his successor. Daniel Baron has served as Silver Oak's Director of Winemaking since 2001. After being approached by numerous large scale alcohol industries with offers to buy Silver Oak, the partners decided they had different visions for the winery. As Justin's son, Matthew Meyer was starting a small production winery on the side - Meyer Family Cellars - in January 2001, co-founder Justin Meyer sold his share of the company to Ray Duncan. Soon after, Justin Meyer died on August 6, 2002, and was commemorated in the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner Hall of Fame at Greystone in Saint Helena. Larry Walker of Wines & Vines accredited Meyer with making important contributions in uniting growers and winemakers, reviving the American Vineyard Foundation, where he served as president, and catapulting the California wine industry to a leading player on the world stage. On New Years Day 2006, the Oakville winery experienced a major flood from the Napa River. The following month, on February 2, 2006, the Oakville winery was devastated by a fire which destroyed the dairy barn, the original structure on the property. The Duncan Family decided to rebuild the Oakville winery from the ground up, which was completed in October 2008. The rebuild included using some 550 tons of reclaimed stone from a 115-year-old dismantled mill in Coffeyville, Kansas, installing 1,464 solar panels to generate solar power for the facility, elevating the property 4.5 feet above the flood plain and moving their iconic water tower 12 feet. The Duncan Family also salvaged the two stained glass windows in the original winery that had been created by local artist Diane Peterson in the theme of the Napa Valley. Peterson was asked during the rebuilding to create two further stained glass windows‚Äîfour windows in total which represent the four seasons. In the tasting room is a glass-house library, built from white oak which had previously been a barn in Missouri, displaying Silver Oak wines dating back to the 1970s. Upon appointment, visitors can be taken on a \\"Silver Tour and Taste\\" or a Silver Tour and Food Pairing, featuring foods prepared by Winery Chef Dominic Orsini. In August 2012, Silver Oak announced the acquisition of Sausal Vineyard and Winery, a boutique winery and vineyard in the Alexander Valley known for its variety of soils which had not been previously available to Silver Oak. In March 2014, Silver Oak Cellars was visited by Hollywood A-listers Drew Barrymore, Reese Witherspoon, and Cameron Diaz. In July 2014, a second generation Napa Valley winemaker Nate Weis joined the firm. On August 24, Silver Oak was affected by the 2014 South Napa earthquake, although $32,500 worth of wine was saved thanks to Duncan's decision to install steadier four-barrel racks after the 2006 fire in anticipation of a future earthquake. In 2017, the Duncan family purchased Napa Valley's Ovid winery, with 15 acres of vineyards set in Pritchard Hill. They also signed an agreement with the San Francisco Giants, becoming their first official wine partner. Vineyards Winemaker Daniel Baron walking through the vineyards at Silver Oak's Oakville winery Fruit for Silver Oak's Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from estate-owned vineyards in the Napa and Alexander Valleys, and from independent partner growers who have a contract with Silver Oak to grow grapes for them. The backbone of Silver Oak's Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon comes from Silver Oak's 113 acre Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard in the Napa Valley where Silver Oak grows Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec grapes. Silver Oak also owns Jump Rock Vineyard, an 18-acre vineyard with rusty-red, rocky soils dedicated to Cabernet Sauvignon. In St. Helena, Silver Oak farms the small 8 acre Navone Vineyard. Its gravelly loam soils help to produce Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Syrah. In Alexander Valley, all of Silver Oak's vineyards are dedicated to growing Cabernet Sauvignon. In 1987, Silver Oak purchased an 80-acre vineyard they named Miraval, the cornerstone of Silver Oak's Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. Miraval Vineyard sits at an elevation of 200‚Äì350 feet with clay and sandy loam soils. In the southern end of the valley, near the course of the Russian River, Silver Oak cultivates the 45 acre Red Tail Vineyard, which they purchased in 1988. It has clay and sandy loam soils at an elevation of 320‚Äì340 feet. In 2012 Duncan bought the 113-acre former Sausal Winery. In 2018 Silver Oak acquired two more vineyards in the area: Big River and Crazy Creek. Winemaking Silver Oak Cabernet Sauvignon is aged for about 25 months exclusively in American oak barrels. Silver Oak's Alexander Valley wines are aged in both new and once-used American oak barrels and spend an additional 14 months in bottle before release. Silver Oak's Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon is aged in only new American oak barrels and spends about 20 months in bottle after barrel. In answer to the question of why Silver Oak insists upon aging their wines in American oak barrels, Meyer once said, \\"I'm happy with a cellar of about 65 degrees. Aging is speeded up by heat and slowed down by cold, but the only thing I do to modify my cellar is drink it faster... To my palate, American oak imparts less wood tannin than French oak. I like tannic wine about as much as I like tough steak.\\" The company formed a partnership with Missouri-based barrel producer A&K; Cooperage in 2000 to have a steady supply of American oak barrels made to Silver Oak's specifications. In 2015, Silver Oak acquired A&K;, becoming the first winery in the United States to own an American cooperage. Silver Oak now has full control of its barrel production, and have officially called it \\"The Oak Cooperage\\". Reception In 2007 the Colorado Biz cited Silver Oak as one of a dozen California wineries which \\"have reached cult status\\" for its Cabernet Sauvignon production and occupies an \\"important niche in California's wine industry.\\" The popularity of the wines means that their new releases are eagerly awaited, cited by The California Directory of Fine Wineries as a \\"ritual for connoisseurs\\", and people often camp out overnight to be at the front of the queues. Noted wine critic Robert Parker cited Silver Oak as one of the best producers of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Napa Valley. Orange Coast Magazine cited Silver Oak's Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon as a \\"beautiful, complex contemporary wine with more than enough polish to stand up to the classics.\\" The Rough Guide to California considers Silver Oak's Cabernet Sauvignon to be the \\"cr√®me de la cr√®me of the heady red.\\" Frommer's said that the firm was \\"long known for producing the go-to cabernet for label-conscious big spenders\\", and Lonely Planet cited the wine as \\"one of those names that you bring to the dinner table to turn heads\\" and added that it was \\"pricey, yes, but legendary.\\" Philip Goldsmith described Silver Oak as a \\"temple for red-wine lovers,\\" highlighting the \\"powerful, velvety\\" taste and \\"unusual aroma,\\" resulting from aging in exclusive American oak barrels. Peg Melnik and Tim Fish described the wine as an \\"art form,\\" which is \\"known to cabernet lovers around the country.\\" In 2012, Wine & Spirits Magazine selected Silver Oak's 2008 Alexander Valley Cabernet as one of \\"Year‚Äôs Best Cabernet Sauvignon,\\" which was acclaimed by critics. In 2016, Oprah Winfrey cited 2012 Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon on her annual \\"Favorite Things\\" list. Technology and sustainability Interior of the winery at Oakville Silver Oak has considered sustainable methods important since its inception. The Duncan Family states that the company's livelihood and future livelihood depend upon the \\"ecological viability of the land\\" and contribute to a better quality grape and wine. The new winery in Oakville, built using reclaimed materials, features 1464 solar panels which provide far more energy than the winery needs and results in 292,000 kilowatt hours sent back to the municipal power grid. The building itself was designed to increase energy efficiency and features a fermentation room with a natural air conditioning system. This system expels hot air, allowing cool night air to enter while the room's large windows and thick walls regulate temperature. The Napa Winery is Green Business certified under the Napa Green Winery Program, administered by the Napa County Department of Environmental Management (DEM), and the Association of Bay Area Government's (ABAG) Green Business Program, meeting the requirements of environmentally sustainable farming such a soil, water and energy conservation. In the vineyard, Silver Oak practices Integrated Pest Management to regulate harmful pests and have installed nesting boxes in their vineyards for bluebirds and owls to help control pests. Between vine rows, Silver Oak grows cover crops to aid in the growth of organic matter, reduce weed growth, help retain soil nutrients and improve soil structure. Their irrigation system in the vineyards is regulated with soil moisture and plant stress monitors to conserve water application. Silver Oak's Soda Canyon Ranch, Miraval, Calistoga, and Geysersville vineyards have been awarded the Fish Friendly Farming Certification, which is awarded to agricultural properties which help restore fish and wildlife habitat and improve the quality of water. In 2016, Silver Oak's Oakville winery became the world's first production winery to be granted LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum Certification under the Existing Buildings, Operation and Maintenance (EB:OM) rating system ‚Äì the highest level of certification granted by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for efficient energy use. Its membrane bioreactor treats an average of 4700 gallons a day during the winemaking process, and allows for the water to be reused for cleaning tanks and flushing the toilets. The winery employs a Co2 heat pump for sanitizing water and over 2500 solar panels for energy, storing it in batteries. In 2018, the Alexander Valley winery achieved LEED Platinum certification for its new Alexander Valley facility, the first in the world to attain it in the category of \\"new construction.\\" According to Bloomberg the facility uses \\"zero toxic materials, solar panels, pure, filtered air, salvaged redwood siding from old 1930s wine tanks and is \\"wrapped in a sleekly modern, barn-style building\\". In 2009, Silver Oak's Associate Winemaker Christiane Schleussner, working with Carlos Macku, Lesa Gonzalez, Ana Cristina Mesquita and Leonard C. Kirch at Cork Supply USA and Cork Supply Portugal, pioneered the commercial sensory evaluation method known as \\"dry cork sensory screening\\" for detecting the chemical compound TCA (2,4,6-trichloroanisol), which is responsible for cork taint.

Another sister, Margaret (Mrs Kelly) (1854‚Äì1927) was noted as being fluent in a number of languages, and translated French works, and her brother Robert Gabriel (1854?‚Äì1882) was the London political correspondent for the Freeman's Journal. Later that year he journeyed to London where he sought work as a journalist. He left to serve in Pope Pius IX's Irish battalion. During the 1860 siege of Ancona, he reported on the conflict for a newspaper in America. Following his military service for the Papacy, he was hired as a correspondent by the New York Herald and reported on the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. In 1869 he was a special correspondent for the Evening Standard, for whom he went to France to report on the Franco-Prussian War. During the Siege of Metz (1870), he was arrested as a spy and nearly put to death. His life was spared through the intervention of other journalists and the French Emperor Napoleon III. He remained with the Standard for the next 25 years. During his career he reported on the Third Carlist War and the Bengal famine. Toward the end of his life he became paralysed, followed by his death in London. He is buried at the St. Mary's Cemetery at Kensal Green, London. He was twice married and was survived by his second wife and a daughter.

He was the Minister of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) of the Executive Yuan since 28 September 2012 until 16 February 2015, when he resigned over the dropping of espionage charges brought against Chang Hsien-yao.http://www.dw.de/taiwans-china-policy-chief-wang-yu- chi-resigns-over-espionage-row/a-18246985 Wang is the first ROC ministerial- level government official to visit Mainland China after the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Education Wang earned his bachelor's degree in law from the National Taiwan University (NTU). During his third year of university in NTU, he went to Singapore for the finals of the annual Asian varsities debate hosted by then Singapore Broadcasting Corporation. As a member of the NTU team, Wang argued persuasively against his group opponent from Nanjing University, saying that \\"mankind co-existing in peace is an impossible ideal\\". His team won. He then continued his master's degree in law from Indiana University in the United States. ROC Mainland Affairs Council =Chinese leader photo ID test= In October 2012, after just less than a week after his appointment as the Minister, Wang was tested to identify Chinese leaders from the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China by Tsai Chi- chang, member of the Democratic Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan. He only managed to identify Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, but failed to do so on the other seven leaders. =New PRC passport= After the issuance of new version of PRC passport in May 2012 which features Taiwan's iconic landmark of Sun Moon Lake and Chingshui Cliff along with China's iconic landmarks of Tiananmen Square and the Great Wall of China, Wang told the Strait Exchange Foundation had written to Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in December 2012 to explain the matter, telling that this incident could harm the good development of cross-strait relations. Taiwan's response to this matter is however, the most lenient one than any other countries depicted in the passport. =New Taiwan Affairs Office director appointment= With the newly appointed Director of Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council Zhang Zhijun in March 2013, Wang said that Zhang is welcomed to visit Taiwan at the appropriate time, suitable capacity and when all of the conditions are set right, because Zhang's predecessor Wang Yi never had the chance to visit Taiwan during his office term. =Cross-strait reciprocal representative offices= In mid April 2013, with the plan for Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) branch office establishment in China and its counterpart Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) branch office establishment in Taiwan, Wang said the office will handle trade, consular affairs, cultural exchanges, protection and emergency assistance for Taiwanese residing in China. However, he emphasized that both SEF and ARATS offices are not official government office, and wish to avoid public misperception that Taiwan-China relations is a state-to-state relation. He added that at the initial phase, Taiwan will set up three SEF branch offices in China, which are in Beijing, central China and southern China. The plan is to establish up to five SEF branch offices. As for ARATS branch offices in Taiwan, he won't allow Beijing to set up ARATS offices in all ROC administrative divisions. In end of June 2013, when asked if Wang can open the proposed SEF offices in China, he said that as long as the Chinese authorities can address him with his formal ministerial title, then he has no problem with that, nothing that this is not a personal issue, but he is the formal appointed official by the government of the Republic of China, therefore he is representing Taiwan. =Taiwanese fisherman shooting incident= After the shooting incident of Taiwanese fisherman by Philippine government vessel on 9 May 2013 at the disputed water in South China Sea, Philippine President Benigno Aquino III said that this matter would be handled by Manila Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei in accordance to One-China policy. Wang responded that this dispute is between the Philippines and Taiwan. It has nothing to do with One-China policy at all. Commenting on Beijing's expression of support to Taiwan because Taiwan is part of China, Wang thanked and appreciated them for the support and offer, but wish them to stay out of this dispute because it will make things more complicated if China were to be involved, MAC informed the Taiwan Affairs Office. =2013 cross-strait service trade agreement= Commenting on the recently signed Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement between ARATS and SEF in Shanghai in end of June 2013, speaking at a forum in Hualien City, Wang said that the pact will help Taiwanese business people in reaching further to the Chinese market and it will greatly benefit Taiwanese doing business in China and that this pact will allow the Taiwanese there to stand at an advantage over other foreign competitors. He further added that the pact is an important components of the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement and that every concession the Chinese authorities has made to the Taiwanese business is greater than those concessions made to other foreign countries. =Macau visit= In end of August 2013, Wang visited Macau, his first visit after taking office as Minister of MAC. During his visit, he met with the Chief Executive of Macau, Fernando Chui, the first time of such meeting between the two leaders. Both of them referred each other by their official title. The two ministers discussed education and tourism issues. Chui raised the issue of when Taiwan will recognize school degrees issued in Macau, to which Wang responded positively. Wang also thanked the Government of Macau for the good treatment and respect he received while being in Macau since his arrival in Macau International Airport. Wang also visited the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Macau for the first time since the ROC representative office was renamed to TECO, in line with the rest of ROC representative offices around the world, since 19 July 2011. He also visited Macau historic areas. =2013 APEC Indonesia= In October 2013, in a hotel lobby on the sidelines of the APEC Indonesia 2013 meetings in the Indonesian island of Bali, Wang met with Zhang Zhijun, a ground breaking historical meeting for the first time between leader of Taiwan Affairs Office and leader of Mainland Affairs Council, where the two addressed each other by each's official title. Both of them called on the establishment of a regular dialogue mechanism between their two agencies to enhance mutual understanding and facilitate cross-strait engagement. Wang was also invited by Zhang to visit China. According to the MAC, by addressing each other by their ministerial title, both Wang and Zhang had shown \\"mutual non-denial\\" of each side's authority to govern and deepened mutual respect between them. President Ma Ying-jeou, through Presidential Office speaker, expressed his gratification, reiterating that the two sides do not deny each other's authority to govern. The Wang- Zhang meeting also marked a good start for normalizing official interactions across the Taiwan Strait. =Wang-Zhang meeting= Wang-Zhang meeting in Taiwan On 11 February 2014, Wang met with Zhang in Nanjing, in the first official, high-level, government-to-government contact between the two sides since 1949. The meeting took place at Purple Palace Nanjing. Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China during the period in which it actually governed mainland China. During the meeting, Wang and Zhang agreed on establishing a direct and regular communication channel between the two sides for future engagement under the 1992 Consensus. They also agreed on finding a solution for health insurance coverage for Taiwanese students studying in mainland China, on pragmatically establishing SEF and ARATS offices in their respective territories and on studying the feasibility of allowing visits to detained persons once these offices have been established. Before shaking hands, Wang addressed Zhang as \\"TAO Director Zhang Zhijun\\" and Zhang addressed Wang as \\"Minister Wang Yu-chi\\" without mentioning the name Mainland Affairs Council. However, Mainland China's Xinhua News Agency referred to Wang as the \\"Responsible Official of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council\\" () in its Chinese- language news and as \\"Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Chief\\" in its English-language news. On 25‚Äì28 June 2014, Zhang pays a retrospective visit to Taiwan. =Meeting with head of ARATS= On 27 February 2014, Wang met with Chen Deming, the President of ARATS, in Taipei. This is the first time meeting between the head of MAC and ARATS. Chen referred Wang as \\"Minister Wang\\". Wang said he looked forward to closely working with Chen. Chen also said that the recent Wang-Zhang Meeting in Nanjing would bring a better cross-strait relations. View on cross-strait relations Lin Join-sane and Wang Yu-chi Wang stated in March 2013 that his view on cross-strait relations is although both Taiwan and mainland China share a close relationship in terms of culture and ethnicity, in terms of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, the two have contrasting stances. Commenting on the initiative of constitutions with different interpretations (ÊÜ≤Ê≥ïÂêÑË°®) for cross-strait relations between the DPP and the CPC put forth by former Chairman of the DPP Frank Hsiehin mid April 2013, Wang explained that the initiative entails state-to-state relations and will not accepted by Beijing. In early May 2013, Wang made a statement that if the PRC is willing to remove all of the missiles pointing at Taiwan voluntarily, it would be a gesture of goodwill which Beijing could show to Taipei, because it doesn't need cross-strait negotiation to carry out, only willingness on the part of mainland China. He added also that he wished to see exchange visits by leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in which both parties address each other using their formal official capacity. In mid June 2013, Wang stressed the ROC government stance that the One-China policy they have been embracing is the Republic of China. As a sovereign and independent state, cross-strait relations is the relations between the two sides of the Republic of China, which are the Taiwan area and the Mainland area. The relationship is based on the 1992 consensus, that there is only one China, and that China is the Republic of China.

The intention was to replace the Swedish Army's disparate tank fleet with a tank that could counter the Soviet IS series heavy tanks and be upgraded continuously. The initial design, in 1951, proposed mounting a 10.5 cm autoloader in an oscillating turret.http://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Projekt_E_M_I_L Due to its size, weight and power to weight it was considered by many to be more of a medium tank than a heavy tank. The project was discontinued during development and only two chassis were built. They were later rebuilt and served as testing platforms for the Artillerikanonvagn 151 and Stridsvagn 103 projects. Project At the end of World War II, it was clear that the mix of tanks in service in the Swedish Armed Forces was not just obsolete but also presented a large logistical problem. Kungliga Arm√©f√∂rvaltningens Tygavdelning (KAFT) conducted a study that concluded that the most cost-effective alternative would be to purchase the newly developed Centurion Mk 3, which while quite modern was judged to have upgrade potential for future requirements. A request of purchase was sent to the United Kingdom, but the reply was that no deliveries could be made before the needs of the British Army had been met which was expected to take between five and 15 years. In 1951, the vehicle bureau of KAFT set about to develop an indigenous manufactured alternative, which they did in great secrecy under the guise of constructing a mobile crane. Parallel with this, negotiations were entered with France about buying the AMX-13 light tank. All this came to an abrupt halt when the British in early December 1952 offered to sell the desired Centurions immediately in order to earn needed foreign currency. The Swedish Minister for Defence, Torsten Nilsson, ended the debate about the future tank purchase by (on his own initiative) signing a deal with the British at the beginning of 1953 with the first Centurion deliveries taking place in April 1953. The delegation in France was forced to depart under heavy apologies while the EMIL-project was terminated. A consortium of Landsverk, Bofors and Volvo suggested to revive it for the F√∂rsvarsbeslut 1958 (white paper of Swedish defence policies 1958) where the replacement for the now ageing Centurions were to be decided upon. EMIL was however regarded as too costly and instead the S-tank proposal was put forward for the final draft which it won and it subsequently became the Stridsvagn 103. Construction Testing of the German Panther and the French AMX 13 tanks in Sweden heavily influenced the initial 1951 design for the Emil project. The known documented statistics for the initial 1951 \\"EMIL\\" were to be as follows: *Turret: Front ‚Äì 180mm @ 45degs horizontal = 212mm eff Cheek, front on ‚Äì 125mm @ 35 deg vertical = 218mm eff Cheek, side on ‚Äì 125mm @ 80 deg horizontal = 127mm eff Side ‚Äì 30mm Rear ‚Äì 30mm *Hull: UFP ‚Äì 100mm @ 22 deg horizontal = 187mm eff LFP ‚Äì 125mm @ 38 deg horizontal = 203mm eff Side ‚Äì 20mm Rear ‚Äì 30mm *Engine: 550 hp *Weight: 25.6t *Power to weight: 20.19 hp/t *Gun Depression/Elevation: -14(15 on sides) / +15 In 1952, the Emil project then progressed to be a counter for the Soviet IS-3 tank which influenced the shape of the hull while the oscillating turret was redesigned. The schematics for the three designs were split into four parts; frontal armor, side/rear armor, engine and armament. For the first studies and trials a chassis which resembled a low IS-7 was built. There were multiple armor thicknesses for both the front and the side which caused a variation in projected weight between the Emil 1, Emil 2 and Emil 3. Turret Configurations: Alt A Turret - \\\\- 140mm @ 44 - 40 deg = 201mm - 217mm eff Hull - UFP - 75mm @ 25 deg = 177mm eff LFP - 120mm @ 38 deg = 195mm eff Alt B Turret \\\\- 170mm @ 44 - 40 deg = 244mm - 264mm eff Hull UFP - 95mm @ 25 deg = 224mm eff LFP - 145mm @ 38 deg = 235mm eff Side turret/side hull/Rear Configuration 1: 40/20/30 2: 60/30/30 3: 80/40/40 Two main options were considered for armament: *120 mm calibre rifled gun ~L/40 *150 mm calibre smoothbore gun~L/40 The ammunition feed regardless of gun was planned to be a dual-drum autoloader allowing for quick selection of ordnance (armor-piercing or high explosive). A new prototype ammunition was tested, which was to be a combination of HEAT and APDS. In case of failure,l a back up armament was chosen: a 105 mm calibre rifled gun ~L/67 Each design was to have a different engine; *Emil 1: 6cyl AOS-895 (500 hp) *Emil 2: 8cyl AV-1195 (540 hp) or 8cyl AVS-1195 (665 hp) *Emil 3: 12cyl AV-1790 (810 hp) During testing of the 12cyl AV-1790 engine on the built Kranvagn hull it was discovered that after sending power to the cooling and other equipment the engine was only sending 723 hp to the drive wheel. There were a total of 6 variations per Emil plan for a total of 18 variations. Weight varied between 30.7t for the Emil I A1 to 41.8t for the Emil III B3. Ultimately the Emil III B3 was the preferred option. The turret side armor (80mm) and rear armor (40mm) was to be dropped to 70mm at the side and 30mm at the rear to improve gun stability as well as gun elevation.http://ftr.wot-news.com/2014/07/15/swedish-tanks-part-xii- emil-1952-1958/ References Main battle tanks of the Cold War Military history of Sweden Main battle tanks of Sweden ","title":"Emil (tank)"},{"id":"38686210","text":"Bad Boys is a manga series written and illustrated by Hiroshi Tanaka.

In a racing career which lasted from 1824 until 1827 he ran ten times and won five races. Unraced as a two-year-old, he was beaten on his first appearance in 1824 but then won the York St Leger and the XYZ Stakes at Newcastle before defeating twenty-two opponents in the St Leger at Doncaster. Jerry missed the entire 1825 season and showed little form in 1826, but won twice as a six-year-old in 1827. He was retired to stud, where he proved to be a successful sire of winners. Background Jerry was a black horse bred in Yorkshire by his owner Richard Gascoigne. According to a description written in 1827, he stood 15.3 hands high and possessed \\"immense muscular power\\". Jerry was one of two classic winners sired by the 1813 Epsom Derby winner Smolensko, the other being the Oaks winner Gulnare. Jerry was the third of fifteen foals produced by Gascoigne's mare Louisa between 1819 and 1837. Her dam Thomasina was a half- sister of the classic winners Symmetry (St Leger) and Theophania (Oaks). Gascoigne sent his colt into training with James Croft at East Wilton near Middleham. Racing career=1824: three-year-old season= 'Jerry', Winner of the St Leger by an unknown artist Jerry did not run as a two-year-old and began his racing career on 22 April 1824 at Catterick Bridge Racecourse in Yorkshire. He started at odds of 2/1 for the two mile race and finished second of the five runners behind Lord Sligo's colt Canteen. Jerry next appeared at York Racecourse on 24 May when he contested a \\"St Leger Stakes\\". The success of the St Leger at Doncaster had led other major courses, including York and Newmarket to use the name for their own long distance races for three-year- olds; the original race was renamed the \\"Great St Leger\\" for several years to distinguish itself from the imitators. Ridden by H. Edwards, he mas made the 5/2 second favourite and recorded his first win by beating Major Cunninghame's Outcry colt and five others, including the favourite Streatham. In July, Jerry was sent north to compete at Newcastle Racecourse in Northumberland and won the two mile XYZ Stakes from a single opponent. Nineteen colts and four fillies were attracted to Doncaster Racecourse on 20 September for the forty- ninth running of the Great St Leger. Jerry was ridden by Ben Smith and started the 9/1 third favourite behind Streatham and Brutandorf. Jerry won the race from Canteen. Shortly after his win in the St Leger, Jerry was sold for 2,000 guineas to Lord Kelburne. =1826: five-year-old season= Jerry missed the entire 1825 season as a result of health problems and failed to reproduce his best form as a five-year-old. He did not reappear in public until 16 May 1826 when he finished unplaced behind the mare Fleur-de-Lis in the two mile York Gold Cup. Two years after his St Leger win, Jerry returned to Doncaster in autumn and produced a \\"very bad\\" performance to be last of the five runners behind Fleur-de-Lis in the Doncaster Cup. Jerry's third and final run of the year came on 4 October, when he finished second to Lord Kennedy's horse Bedlamite in the Richmond Gold Cup. =1827: six-year-old season= Three years after his debut, Jerry returned to Catterick Bridge Racecourse for the ten furlong Craven Stakes in April 1827. Ridden by Edwards, he started at odds of 9/2 against eight opponents and recorded his first success in thirty months as he won from the Duke of Leeds' colt Sirius. On 23 May at York he ran second to Fleur-de-Lis in the Constitution Stakes, finishing ahead of Humphrey Clinker and Sirius. Jerry next appeared at York in August when he was required to concede eleven pounds to the 1826 St Leger winner Tarrare in a two mile sweepstakes. Jerry, who started at odds of 7/2, took an early lead and set a very strong pace. He was challenged and overtaken by Tarrare in the straight but rallied to defeat the younger horse by half a length after a \\"very severe race\\" and end his racing career with a win. Stud career Jerry began his stud career at Boroughbridge in Yorkshire at a covering fee of 10 sovereigns. For the 1831 season, Lord Kelburne moved his stallion to Scotland where he stood at Hawkhead near Paisley at a slightly increased fee of 11 sovereigns, but a year later Jerry was back in Yorkshire and standing at 20 sovereigns. By 1838 he was at Mr Edwards' stud at Newmarket and it was reported that his stock were selling for high prices. Three years later he had been moved to the Duke of Grafton's stud at Euston Hall, near Thetford and was standing at a reduced fee of 12 guineas. Jerry died on 14 May 1851 at Middleham under the ownership of the Earl of Glasgow. Jerry's only classic winner was Clearwell, a grey colt who won the 2000 Guineas in 1833. Jerry had some success as a sire of sires: his son Tomboy sired the St Leger winner Nutwith and was the damsire of the 1000 Guineas winner Manganese, later a successful broodmare. Another of Jerry's sons was Jericho, a successful racehorse who sired the 2000 Guineas winner The Promised Land. Jerry's last notable offspring were foaled in 1845.

He was the eldest son of Sir Cecil Bisshopp, 7th Baronet of Parham Park, West Sussex and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father in 1779. He was awarded a DCL at Oxford University and in 1791 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He entered Parliament in 1780 as the member for New Shoreham, sitting until 1790, and then again in 1796, sitting until 1806. In 1795, during the French Revolutionary Wars, he raised the Parham Troop of Sussex Yeomanry. It usually exercised at his estate at Parham Park, drilling in the gallery of the house when the weather was wet.Maj A. McK, Annand, 'Sir Cecil Bysshopp, Bart.

In 1815 the Barony of Zouche was called out of abeyance in his favour and he thus became the twelfth Baron Zouche. He married Harriet Anne, the daughter and heiress of William Southwell of Frampton, Gloucestershire, with whom he had 2 sons and 3 daughters. Both sons died before him: the eldest son Lieutenant- Colonel Cecil Bisshopp died in 1813 at age 30 at Ontario, Canada, from wounds received in action against the Americans. The second son, Lieutenant Charles Cecil, Royal Navy, died unmarried in Jamaica in 1808 of yellow fever after the frigate Muros was wrecked whilst endeavouring to destroy some batteries near Havana, Cuba. Thus on his death in 1828 he was succeeded in the Baronetcy (but not the family estate at Parham) by his cousin George Bisshopp, Dean of Lismore in Ireland, while the Barony of Zouche once again fell into abeyance, this time between his two surviving daughters Hon.

The Carthaginians took control of Sardinia around the year 500 BC, and lost it in 238 BC after the First Punic War. After that the new Roman province of Sardinia et Corsica established an almost exclusive use of written and spoken Latin for more than eight centuries, as a result of the linguistic Romanization of the entire island. After briefly being occupied by the Vandals in approximately 456, it was again taken by the Romans in 534 AD, more precisely the Byzantine Romans from the East, who gradually introduced medieval Greek at all levels of society, while the common people continued to speak a Latin dialect which evolved, after some centuries, into medieval Sardinian Romance. In this period Latin still remained the language of religious culture as the Sardinian Church was strictly related to Rome, while Greek was the language of political power, that of the very far but mighty Emperor of Costantinople. The new millennium brought an attempted conquest by Muslims, which failed on account of the fleets of Pisa and Genua, but at the same time brought a new rapprochement to western Europe, as Byzantines were no longer able to defend the farthest part of their ‚ÄúŒøŒπŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑‚Äù (ecumene).

The most tender ode is written in Greek: From your ashes, Pomptilla, violets and lilies flourish and may you bloom again in the petals of the rose, of the fragrant crocus, of the eternal amaranth, and of the beautiful flowers of the white panzy, like the narcissus and the sad amaranth, also the time that will, always will have your flower. In fact, when already the spirit of Philip was about to melt from his limbs, and he had his soul on his lips, Pomptilla, leaning on his pale groom, Pontilla the life of him with hers exchanged. And the Gods broke a union so happy, for the sake of her sweet husband died Pontilla; now Philip is living against his will, always longing to be able to confuse soon his soul with that of the bride who loved him so muchTheodor Mommsen, CIL, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, Inscriptiones Sardiniae, G.

The carmina in the Grotta della Vipera enshrine the beginning of the literary history of the island. From the late Roman period we have received the highly polemical writings of St. Lucifer from Cagliari,Epistole ad Eusebio, De regibus apostaticis, Pro S. Athanasio, De non parcendo in Deum delinquentibus, Moriendum esse pro filio Dei, Opere, a cura di G. di Tilet, vescovo di Meaux, 1568, Opere, in Maxima biblioteca patrum, vol. IV, Lione, 1687, Opere, a cura di S. Coleti, Venezia, 1778 a staunch defender of Catholic orthodoxy against the Arian heresy. Other writings on theology have come to us from the Bishop Eusebius of Vercelli, born in Cagliari,Epistole Antiquorum patrum sermones et epistolae de Sancto Eusebio vercellensi et martire ex codice manuscripto veteri tabularii ecclesiae vercellensis periscorum item patium et aliorum authorum testimonia de eodem. Vita praeterea eiusdem..., Mediolani, 1581 and a contemporary of Lucifer.  The Middle Ages  Medium-Hellenic inscription of the ninth century A.D., coming from southern Sardinia Carta de logu de Arbarei Literary production was few throughout the Middle Ages: some hagiographic texts, in Latin, in prose and poetry, often extensively reworked in later centuries, have come down to us. Some of them have very ancient origins, perhaps dating back to the monastery and religious literature that was created in Cagliari around the figure of St. Fulgence of RuspeFerrando, Vita Fulgentii: iuxta basilica sancti martyris Saturnini, procul a strepitu civitatis vacantem reperiens solum, Brumasio Calaritanae civitatis antistite venerabili prius sicut decuit postulato, novum sumptibus propriis monasterium fabricavit at the time of his exile during the reign vandal Thrasamund. In this period were written in Cagliari some of the most precious and ancient codes of the time, like maybe the Codex Lausianus, containing one or perhaps the oldest one edition of the Acts of the Apostles, has come down and now preserved in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, and the Codex Basilianus, containing some of the works of St. Hilary of Poitiers, wrote in Cagliari, as a specified in a note in the manuscript and preserved in the Vatican Library.Codex D.182, Archivio di San Pietro: Contuli in nomine Domini Iesu Christi aput Karalis constitutus anno quartodecimo Trasamundi Regis The Passions of the martyrs San Saturno, San Lussorio and San Gavino also come down as well as the hagiographic stories of Sant'Antioco and San Giorgio from Suelli.Officium beati Georgii: ‚ÄúAve presul Suellensis, semper Deum diligens, habens linguam bone ensis, viam Deo edocens, propter quod es cum immensis / regnum Dei possidens. Tunc in mundo docuisti / Dominum diligere, per opera demonstrasti / ad celos ascendere, et numquam retardasti / languidis occurrere. O fellix pontifex noster, Angelorum concivis, qui semper fuisti pater / adiuvansque miseris, quem portavit tua mater / sanctum semper in ulnis. Pastorali insignitus / huius sedis baculo, gregem pasce quo fulcitus / es celesti pabulo, placa Deum non oblitus / tuo populo. Laus virtus et honor Deo / sit patri ingenito / flamini et Nazareno / patris unigenito / qui dat pacem cum tropheo / Georgio inclito. Amen.‚Äù - ‚Äú Preterea supradictus kalaritanus Iudex (Troodori) incurit grauissimam et miserabilem calamitatem; nam cum hora prandii sivecenae prepararetur sibi mensa, referta multis ciborum ferculis, statim omnes cibi scarabeis atque scabronibus et uariis operiebantur sordibus. Cumque tantum creuisset hec persecutio, ut iam non posset sumere cibum nisi quasi abscondite manutenendo, tandem salubri reperto consilio, venit ad seruum Dei Jeorgium, et retulit ei miseriam qua cotidie affligebatur; deprecatus est etiam multis precibus et lacrimis, ut sibi subuenire dignaretur, et suis cum precibus a presenti liberaret exitio. Quod cum audisset beatus Jeorgius , misericordia motus super eum, iussit eum secum uenire ad prandium. Cumque uentum esset , ad mensam precepit illum discumbere, accipiensque panem, benedixit ac fregit et dedit illi, et pariter comederunt. Ex illa igitur hora liberatus est Iudex a supradicta miseria et iam nulle sordes in eius conuiuio apparuerunt. Videns autem se precibus et meritis beati Jeorgii esse saluatum, dedit ei uillam suellensem cum terris et siluis, seruis et ancillis et omni suppelletili, ut ipse omnesque sui sucessores eam sine lite possiderent. Coniux uero eius, nomine Sinispella, optulit sancto Jeorgio villam Simeri cum omnibus suis pertinentiis; et delegauit ei omnem suam portionem, ut post mortem suam ipse omnesque sui sucessores eam iure possiderent Characteristic of medieval Sardinia, in the eleventh century, was the early use of the vernacular in the acts of the Sardinian kings, records of monasteries or notary and in the legislation. For the history of the island, particular importance had the promulgation of the Carta de Logu of Arborea, a legal code which condensed the old common law especially for the countryside, to integrate of Roman laws (Codex Justinianus)http://eprints.uniss.it/5713/1/Sini_F_Diritto_romano_nella_Carta.pdf in force across Europe. The early use of vulgar Sardinian date back to the eleventh century: we can find it in the acts of donations of the Judges (kings) to various religious orders and in condaxis or condaghes that were administrative documents. Among the most important texts are the statutes of the Commune of Sassari, written in Latin and logudorese Sardinian in 1316. The document is divided into three parts: the first concerns the public law, civil law, the second and the third criminal law. This code was gradually adopted by many municipalities on the island. Other municipalities had their own statutes, as Cagliari and Iglesias, whose short of Villa di Chiesa was prepared in Tuscany. Also in the fourteenth century was promulgated by Mariano IV the Carta de Logu, which was the code of the laws of the State of the court of Arborea. The paper was subsequently updated and expanded by Eleanor, daughter of Mariano. This code of laws continues to be considered one of the most innovative and interesting of the XIII century. There is no literature in Sardinia for most of the Middle Ages. In Judicial era there are several documents in Sardinian typically consisting of records and legal documents, that consists of condaghi and different cartas de logu. A small medieval text in the history of the Sardinian judge of Torres, the Libellus Judicum TurritanorumE. Besta, Il Liber Iudicum Turritanorum, con altri documenti logudoresi, Palermo, 1906. - A. Boscolo-A. Sanna, Libellus Judicum Turritanorum, Cagliari, 1957. - A.

The first literary work in Sardinian, now at the end of the Middle Ages, from the second half of the fifteenth century, however, published about a century later. It is a poem inspired by the life of the holy martyrs turritani by the Archbishop of Sassari Antonio Canu. This work is the only one before the second half of the sixteenth century. [edit]  Habsburg Sardinia  Cima del monte Parnaso espa√±ol con las tres musas castellanas Caliope, Urania y Euterpe EL FORASTERO Giuseppe Zatrillas Vicente Bacallar y Sanna The final fall of East Roman Empire to the Turks (and their spread in the Balkan-Greek peninsula) in 1453, the expulsion of the Arab-Berber Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula, the geographical discoveries, culminated with the discovery of the New World, and, finally, the focus in one man, Charles V, of a vast empire, carry Europe and with it Sardinia in the modern age. The Sardinian authors of the sixteenth century as Antonio Lo Frasso, Sigismund Arquer, Giovanni Francesco Fara, Pedro Delitala will be multilingual, multicultural. While Lo Frasso writes his poems in Spanish, Catalan and Sardinian, Delitala choose to write in Italian or Tuscan, and Jeronimo Araolla writes in three languages. But by that time, the penetration of Castilian as a literary language knows no barriers and becomes overwhelmingly in the seventeenth century, while the non-fiction of the period use Latin as in the rest of Europe. Production in Latin was so strong that even in 1837 the Piedmont botanist Giuseppe Giacinto Moris, a professor at the University of Cagliari, published his Flora sardoa, the first systematic study of the Sardinian flora, entirely in Latin. In the seventeenth century there is a further integration with the Iberian world as demonstrated by the works of the Spanish speaking Sardinian poets Giuseppe Delitala y Castelv√¨ and Jose Zatrillas, and historian Angelo Francesco de Vico, while those of Francesco Vidal.  18th and 19th centuries Giovanni Spano In the eighteenth century, the outcome of the War of Spanish succession drew Sardinia away from the plurisecular Iberian orbit. The crown of the kingdom passed to the House of Savoy, and during the century the ideas of the Enlightenment spread, as well as an increasing of education and culture, owing to the public works and reform of Giovanni Battista Lorenzo Bogino, with the introduction of Italian as official language at the expense of Spanish and the native languages. In the second half of the eighteenth century a production of \\"gender\\" oratorio (mostly only in manuscript) takes shape in Sardinian who has the highest representative on the priest Giovanni Battista Zonchello Espada from Sedilo. The sacred oratory, for quality and quantity of production (also given to the press), will impose, however, only in the following century by Angelo Maria De Martis, Salvatore Cossu, Frassu Salvatore, Antonio Soggiu (founder of a school of oratory in Oristano) and Salvatore Carboni. In the first half of the twentieth century prose sacred Sardinian prosegur√† with many authors such Eugenuo Sanna from Milis, Pietro Maria Cossu from Escovedu, Aurelio Puddu from Barumini, Efisio Marras from Allai and the priest novelist and writer Pietro Casu from Berchidda. In the 19th century modern science was born in Sardinia. Giovanni Spano undertook the first archaeological excavations, Giuseppe Manno wrote the first great general history of the island, Pasquale Tola published important documents of the past, Pietro Martini writes biographies of famous Sardinian, Alberto La Marmora runs through the island far and wide, studying in detail and writing a massive work in four parts entitled Voyage en Sardaigne, published in Paris. In the nineteenth century many travelers visit the city and island districts. Throughout the century, arriving in Sardinia Alphonse de Lamartine, Honor√© de Balzac, Antonio Bresciani, Paolo Mantegazza and others. Between the 19th and the 20th centuries the birth of Sardinian Philology dates back, or the study on textual productions of the Romance languages historically spoken and written in Sardinia. The initiator of this philological and literary approach was Max Leopold Wagner and Giuliano Bonazzi for literary texts, as well as Enrico Besta and Arrigo Solmi were the initiators for official documents and historical legal texts. And in the twentieth century the contribution in the same vein of historical legal research was due to Alberto Boscolo and his school in the mid sixties.  20th century Also in the early twentieth century, Enrico Costa tells the stories of some of the legendary figures of the island. But it was the work of Grazia Deledda to raise awareness of Sardinia in the world, especially after the writer was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1926. An important contribution to literary culture came from Antonio Gramsci and Emilio Lussu. Important anthropologists have written about Sardinia, the most recent: Ernesto de Martino, Mario Alberto Cirese, Giulio Angioni Michelangelo Pira, Clara Gallini. After World War II emerged with figures such as Giuseppe Dessi, his novels including his Paese d'ombre (country of shadows). In more recent years the autobiographical novels of Gavino Ledda Padre padrone and Salvatore Satta Judgment Day had widely reported, in addition to works by Sergio Atzeni, Maria Giacobbe, Salvatore Mannuzzu, Giulio Angioni, Marcello Fois, Michela Murgia, Salvatore Niffoi, Bianca Pitzorno, Gianfranco Pintore and Flavio Soriga. Campidanese sardinian language comic theather Campidanese sardinian language At the beginning of the twentieth century a locally successful line of authors of comic theater developed in the Campidanese Sardinian language. Based mostly on the funniness of the characters of the city of Cagliari at the time and of the Campidanese peasants and their difficulty in expressing themselves in Italian, it drew its roots which can already be glimpsed in the sixteenth-century works of Juan Francisco Carmona, from the accentuated difference between the city, provincial but inserted in the contemporary world and a good-natured and reserved rural environment. The trend, albeit with the exhaustion of the authors still has a large following of audiences in the theater and in comedy television broadcasts. The greatest authors were Emanuele Pilu, Efisio Vincenzo Nelis, Antonio Garau.

The final four year analysis from the pivotal phase 3 study upon which TVEC was approved by the FDA showed a 31.5% response rate with a 16.9% CR rate. There was also a substantial and statistically significant survival benefit in patients with earlier metastatic disease (stages IIIb-IVM1a) and in patients who hadn't received prior systemic treatment for melanoma. The earlier stage group had a reduction in the risk of death of approximately 50% with one in four patients appearing to have met, or be close to be reaching, the medical definition of cure. Real world use of talimogene laherparepvec have shown response rates of up to 88.5% with CR rates of up to 61.5% Int J Cancer. Around half of people treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials experienced fatigue and chills; around 40% had fever, around 35% had nausea, and around 30% had flu-like symptoms as well as pain at the injection site. The reactions were mild to moderate in severity; 2% of people had severe reactions and these were generally cellulitis. Talimogene laherparepvec is a genetically engineered herpes virus (an oncolytic herpes virus). Two genes were removed ‚Äì one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, and another that helps the virus evade the immune system ‚Äì and a gene for human GM-CSF was added. The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response against the patient's cancer, which has been demonstrated by multiple pieces of data, including regression of tumors which have not been injected with talimogene laherparepvec. The drug was created and initially developed by BioVex, Inc. and was continued by Amgen, which acquired BioVex in 2011. It was the first oncolytic immunotherapy approved globally; it was approved in the US in October 2015 and approved in Europe in December 2015. Medical uses Talimogene laherparepvec is delivered by injecting it directly into tumors, thereby creating a systemic anti-tumor immune response. In the US, talimogene laherparepvec is FDA approved to treat Stage IIIb-IVM1c melanoma patients for whom surgical intervention is not appropriate and with tumors which can be directly injected; the EMA approved population in Europe is for Stage IIIb-IVM1a. For label updates see FDA index page for BLA 125518 See Annex 1: Summary of Product Characteristics; last updated September 7, 2016. Talimogene laherparepvec has been proven to significantly extend survival in patients with Stage IIIb-IVM1a melanoma and patients who have not received prior systemic therapy for melanoma. Adverse effects Around half of people treated with talimogene laherparepvec in clinical trials experienced fatigue and chills; around 40% had fever, around 35% had nausea, and around 30% had flu-like symptoms as well as pain at the injection site. The reactions were mild to moderate in severity; 2% of people had severe reactions and these were generally cellulitis. More than 10% of people had edema, headache, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, muscle pain, or joint pain. Between 1% and 10% developed cold sores, pain or infection in the lesion, anemia, immune mediated events (like vasculitis, pneumonia, worsening psoriasis, glomerulonephritis and vitiligo ), dehydration, confusion, anxiety, depression, dizziness, insomnia, ear pain, fast heart beating, deep vein thrombosis, high blood pressure, flushing, shortness of breath when exercising, sore throat, symptoms of the common cold, stomach pain, back pain, groin pain, weight loss, or oozing from the injection site. Pharmacology Talimogene laherparepvec is taken up by normal cells and cancer cells like the wild type herpes simplex virus, it is cleared in the same way. Mechanism Talimogene laherparepvec directly destroys the cancer cells it infects, inducing a systemic immune response against the patient's cancer. The virus invades both cancerous and healthy cells, but it cannot productively replicate in healthy tissue because it lacks Infected cell protein 34.5 (ICP34.5). When cells are infected with a virus they shut down and die, but ICP34.5 blocks this stress response, allowing the virus to hijack the cell's translation machinery to replicate itself. A herpesvirus lacking the gene coding for ICP34.5 cannot replicate in normal tissue. However, in many cancer cells the stress response is already disrupted, so a virus lacking ICP34.5 can still replicate in tumors. After the virus has replicated many times, the cell swells and finally bursts, killing the cell and releasing the copies of the virus, which can then infect nearby cells. While talimogene laherparepvec is using the cell's translation machinery to replicate, it also uses it to make the cell create GM-CSF. GM-CSF is secreted or released when the cancer cell bursts, attracting dendritic cells to the site, which pick up the tumor antigens, process them, and then present them on their surface to cytotoxic (killer) T cells which in turn sets off an immune response. Composition Talimogene laherparepvec is a biopharmaceutical drug; it is an oncolytic herpes virus that was created by genetically engineering a strain of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) taken from a person infected with the virus, rather than a laboratory strain. Both copies of the viral gene coding for ICP34.5 were deleted and replaced with the gene coding for human GM-CSF, and the gene coding for ICP47 was removed. In wild herpes virus, ICP47 suppresses the immune response to the virus; it was removed because the drug was designed with the intention of activating the immune system. History The first oncolytic virus to be approved by a regulatory agency was a genetically modified adenovirus named H101 by Shanghai Sunway Biotech. It gained regulatory approval in 2005 from China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer. Talimogene laherparepvec is the world's first approved oncolytic immunotherapy, i.e. it was also designed to provide systemic anti-tumor effects through the induction of an anti-tumor immune response. Talimogene laherparepvec was created and initially developed by BioVex, Inc. under the brand OncoVEXGM-CSF. Development was continued by Amgen, which acquired BioVex in 2011. BioVex was founded in 1999, based on research by Robert Coffin at University College London, and moved its headquarters to Woburn, Massachusetts in 2005, leaving about half its employees in the UK. The phase II clinical trial in melanoma was published in 2009 and the phase III trial was published in 2013. Talimogene laherparepvec was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat melanoma in October 2015. It was the first approval of an oncolytic virus and the first approval of a gene therapy in the West. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency in December of that year.  Society and culture = Economics = Amgen estimated that talimogene laherparepvec would be priced at per patient at the time it was approved. Research As of 2016, talimogene laherparepvec had been studied in early stage clinical trials in pancreatic cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma; it had also been tested in combination with checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and pembrolizumab.

Root (1808‚Äì1865), was a cap & ball single-action pocket revolver used during the American Civil War and made by the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company in two calibers: .28 and .31.Less Common Guns in the Civil War: Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Revolver (a description of the Sidehammer, by writer Emory Hackman)  Calibers and variants  In the revolver configuration of the patented revolving mechanism, only one model of revolver was produced. The only two available calibers for the revolver were .28 and .31. The production of the revolver started in 1855 and lasted until 1870. In spite of the complexity and ambition of its patented design, the Sidehammer revolver never reached the status of a popular gun.The Sidehammer as described in the Autry Museum , a Museum dealing with the people and the history of the American West = Model series = Production began in 1855 with the Model 1 followed by the Model 1A and then the Model 2 beginning with serial number \\"1\\" and ending in 1860 at about \\"25,000\\". These models had a roller-die engraved scene referred to as the \\"Cabin and Indian\\" scene. Production continued with the Model 3 which has a fluted cylinder = Barrels, cylinders = Colt Root 1855 Revolver, Model 7, cal .31 USMA Cadet George Armstrong Custer with Colt Sidehammer pistol about 1859 The standard barrel length was 3 1/2 inch (4 1/2 inch for the Model 5A, 6A, 7A). Calibers were .28 (Model 1 - 3) later .31 (Models 3A, 4, 5, 6, 7). Octagon barrels (Model 1 - 4). Round barrels (Model 5 - 7). The cylinder scene engraved on the first 25,000 pistols was created by banknote engraver Waterman Ormsby. The image was his fourth and last to be featured on Colt revolvers. The overall scene is 1 1/16 inch wide by 3 1/4 inch long. At one end of the scene is the text, \\"COLT'S PATENT No. [serial number]\\". The image contains a pioneer defending himself against an attack by six Indians in Seminole-style attire using a pair of revolver pistols while (presumably) his wife and child are escaping. Along the top of the scene (the edge of the cylinder which is closest to the pistol barrel) is a \\"finely detailed wavy line and dot border\\". The Model 3, 4 and 5 had a fluted cylinder (with indentations between the loading chambers), preventing the application of a continuously engraved scene. Some cylinders were decoratively hand-engraved. The Model 6 and 7 had a round cylinder, with the rolled on \\"Stagecoach Holdup\\" scene by W. L. Ormsby.  Influences in later Colt firearms  In 1855 the Sidehammer was the first Colt's revolver to use the \\"creeping\\" loading lever. This loading mechanism was used again in 1860 in the design of the Colt Army Model 1860, the Colt Navy Model 1861 and the Colt Police Model 1862. In 1855 the Sidehammer was the first Colt's solid- frame spur-trigger gun. This anatomical characteristic was taken again when the three models of the Colt Derringer started production in 1870. For the two first models production lasted in 1890, and the third model ended in 1912 (until it was re-released in the 1950s for western movies, under the name of fourth model Colt Derringer). But in the Colt Derringers, the solid-frame spur-trigger design was still present in the patent when Colt's purchased the National Arms Company in 1870. Actual original Colt models subsequent to the Sidehammer and inheriting a solid frame and a spur trigger were the Colt House (1871) and the Colt New Line (1873).

Property rights include the rights of possession, the rights of use, and the enjoyment of property to the exclusion of humans. Jurisdiction over animals is divided between the federal government and the provinces under the Constitution of Canada. The federal government, using its criminal law power, has created offences in the Criminal Code, in relation to animal suffering, defining the limitations and penalties in the event of breaches. The federal Parliament also has jurisdiction over the import of animals. The provinces have jurisdiction over animals as part of their power to regulate property laws. Criminal Code provisions=Current provisions= Provisions for animal cruelty were originally enacted in 1892. Cattle and other working animals have more protection than other species. In general, owned animals also have more protection than unowned animals. Crimes of neglect are rarely prosecuted because of the term \\"wilful neglect\\", which is difficult to prove. There is no provision for training animals to fight other animals, nor for receiving money from animal fights. Law enforcement animals have no special protection. The Criminal Code makes the deliberate killing, wounding, maiming, injuring, or poisoning of an animal as well as acts of deliberate cruelty can result in a prison sentence of up to 5 years or a fine of up to $10,000. A prison sentence of up to 18 months may also accompany a fine. Specific acts of cruelty detailed in the code are: causing unnecessary pain or suffering, administering or allowing the administration of a poisonous substance or drug, and participating in the freeing of captured birds to be shot on liberation. Persons who allow their property to be used for any of the above activities may also be charged, unless there is sufficient evidence that they were unaware of how their property was used. Failure to exercise reasonable care to prevent the suffering of an animal also counts as wilfully allowing the suffering. =Attempts at reform= In 1999, the Government of Canada began gathering input on what changes were needed to update the provisions. Then Justice Minister Anne McLellan tabled Bill C-17 in December of that year, but the bill died due to the election call of early 2000. Over the next five years, the Liberal government repeatedly retabled the bill as it died again due to repeated prorogations. The bill nearly passed in 2003 as Bill C-10B, with the support of all parties, but was blocked by the Senate. When the Conservative Party came to power in 2006, MP Mark Holland tabled a private member‚Äôs bill that was virtually identical to Bill C-50, the most recent incarnation of C-17. Holland also retabled his bill repeatedly as it died with prorogation. The New Democratic Party also tabled its own version of the bill, C-558, in June 2008. In February 2005, Liberal Senator John Bryden tabled Bill S-24. Animal groups like the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies strongly opposed this bill with the support of a petition, containing almost 112,000 signatures from the Canadian public. While S-24 did increase the penalties for misconduct (the penalties section was taken from the Liberal government bill that had not yet passed), it fell short of much-needed updates to the list of offences. Bryden had to retable the bill as, like the others, it repeatedly died due to prorogation. Bryden's bill ultimately passed through the Senate and House of Commons of Canada as Bill S-203, enacted in June 2008. =Bill C-229 (40th Parliament of Canada, 1st Session)= In 2009, Mark Holland tabled Bill C-229, which was supported by both animal protection groups and most animal use industries. This bill would update many of the archaic offenses that had not changed substantially since 1892. If passed, this bill would have updated the wording of the current Criminal Code as it deals with animal cruelty in order to more effectively identify misconduct. Animal cruelty would no longer have been considered a property offence. It would have protected all animals equally, regardless of species and whether or not they were owned. The term \\"wilful neglect\\" would have been replaced with \\"negligent\\". There would have been new provisions for killing an animal in a particularly brutal or vicious manner, training animals to fight or receiving money for animal fights, and special protection for law enforcement animals. The bill would have maintained protection for lawful animal use activities such as farming, hunting, fishing, and scientific research. The bill was not passed. Efforts are now being made at the provincial level to elevate the status of animals from property to sentient (i.e., feeling) beings. Bill 54 (41st Quebec Legislature, 1st Session) Bill 54 was introduced in the 41st Quebec legislature in June 2015 and consultations are being held during September 14‚Äì29, 2015. This bill would classify animals as sentient beings and would allow jailing animal abusers. Import regulations The Health of Animals Regulations must be followed for all animals in human care while in Canada. Endangered species are subject to additional controls by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. In Canada, these controls are administered by the Canadian Wildlife Service. Environment and human health analysis may also be required under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act before importation is permitted. =Amphibians and reptiles= There are no regulations on the imports of reptiles and amphibians, except for turtles and tortoises, which require an import permit from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Pet turtles and tortoises must have been in the owner‚Äôs possession in the country of origin and must accompany the owner into Canada. Permits for turtle and tortoise eggs are only issued to zoos and research laboratories. =Birds= Pet birds imported from the United States must accompany the owner or an immediately family member into Canada. They must be found to be healthy when inspected at the place of entry and have been in the owner‚Äôs possession for 90 days preceding the importation, during which they cannot have been in contact with any other birds. If the bird is less than three days old, the owner must have been in possession of its mother and father for the preceding 90 days and both birds must have the same health status. The birds must also be pets, not intended for re-sale. Finally, neither the owner nor any member of their family may have imported birds into Canada under the pet bird provision during the preceding 90 days. Importation of birds from countries in which highly pathogenic avian flu is endemic (Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Vietnam) is prohibited. Importation from other countries requires a CFIA permit. =Cats= Domestic cats aged 3 months or older from a country recognized by Canada as free of rabies must be accompanied by a rabies vaccination certificate or a veterinary certificate declaring that country of origin is rabies-free. Cats from a country not so recognized must be accompanied by a vaccination certificate. Without a certificate, the owner must have their cat vaccinated and provide a record of the vaccination to a CFIA office. =Dogs= Regulations for domestic dogs vary with the age of the dog and whether the country of origin is recognized by Canada as rabies-free. In general, dogs must be accompanied by a certification of rabies vaccination or that the country of origin is rabies-free. =Aquatic animals= Aquatic animals such as fish, crustaceans, and molluscs must be declared. If the animal is on the Susceptible Species of Aquatic Animals list and cannot be exempt (for example, if the owner can attest that the animal will not come into contact with other aquatic species other than those kept in the household), a permit is required. =Rodents= Rodents do not require a permit except for prairie dogs, Gambian pouched rats, squirrels, or rodents from Africa. Permits are also required for rats in Alberta. =Horses= Horses may be imported from the United States with an export certificate from the United States Department of Agriculture. =Rabbits= Pet rabbits from countries other than the United States require a permit. =Primates= Pet non-human primates are not permitted entry into Canada. Import permits are possible for primates destined for zoos, exhibitions or scientific research.

Mount Hinman is less than west of Mount Daniel and both are within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Hinman Glacier is situated on the north flank of Mount Hinman and Foss Glacier is to the northeast. The mountain was named in 1934 for Dr. Harry B. Hinman, a founder of the Everett branch of The Mountaineers club.The Mountaineers - Everett Branch History Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Waruszewski as the cinematographer. The film follows the career of Bill Watterson, the author of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, and the influence of both the author and the comic strip on the world. Watterson ended the strip on December 31, 1995,Final Calvin and Hobbes- Last Comic - by Bill Watterson for December 31, 1995-GoComics and since then has avoided the public eye. History The origin of Dear Mr. Watterson came from Schroeder wanting to understand the cultural impact of Bill Watterson's decade-long comic strip, so he began with a series of fan interviews in December 2007. Dear Mr. Watterson launched its first Kickstarter campaign on December 15, 2009, ending March 15, 2010. The Kickstarter raised more than 200% of the goal of $12,000. After the first fundraising campaign, the filmmakers interviewed Berkeley Breathed, Lee Salem, Stephan Pastis, Jef Mallett, Dave Kellett, Charles Solomon, Seth Green, Keith Knight, Jenny Robb, Tony Cochran, Andrew Farago (Cartoon Art Museum), Joe Wos (Toonseum), Jean Schulz, Jan Eliot, Bill Amend, and more. In addition, a second Kickstarter campaign was launched in order to fund the finishing of the project. The campaign was successfully funded July 14, 2012. On November 21, 2012, Schroeder reported to the Kickstarter backers that they had completed the Martini Shot, which is the last take you shoot while in production on a film. In late December 2012, the crew shipped nearly 200 posters to backers of their Kickstarter all over the world. The filmmakers submitted their documentary to festivals around the world, and on March 1, 2013 they announced that Dear Mr. Watterson had been accepted into the 37th Annual Cleveland International Film Festival.

Influences and impact The director Joel Schroeder recalls: The film began with Schroeder interviewing fans of the strip to better understand the cultural impact it had. The filmmaker did not seek to interview Watterson knowing his reclusiveness (the artist was invited to the premiere, but watched the DVD instead).'Calvin and Hobbes' Documentary and E-Books|Time.com In an interview with NPR's Weekend Edition, Schroeder explained that Watterson's final cartoon exemplified the strip's enduring appeal. Said Schroeder, describing the panel: \\"It's a fresh layer of snow and Calvin and Hobbes are out with the toboggan, and Calvin looks to Hobbes and says, 'It's a magical world, old buddy ... let's go exploring.' And those last words are just, I think, a challenge to all of us to make sure that we have that curiosity. And words, I think words to live by.\\" The film was later parodied in an episode of Documentary Now! as \\"Searching for Mr. Larson\\", where Fred Armisen portrays a narcissistic filmmaker attempting to find The Far Side creator Gary Larson.

The storm developed as a tropical depression over the South China Sea on May 22\\\\. Tracking north-northwestward, the system steadily intensified, attaining peak winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed Cecil to have been slightly stronger with one-minute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). The storm made landfall near Hoi An, Vietnam early on May 25 and quickly weakened. The system later dissipated over Laos on May 26\\\\. In Vietnam, heavy rains accompanied the storm, amounting to over in some areas, triggered catastrophic and deadly flooding. Widespread structural and agricultural losses took place in addition to the significant loss of life, with damage estimated at ‚Ç´300 billion ($71.7 million). In the wake of the flooding, some international aid was sent to Vietnam, though most relief work was conducted by the nation's government, local agencies, and the Red Cross. Meteorological history On May 20, following Typhoon Brenda's passage through the South China Sea, a monsoon trough extending from the area into the Bay of Bengal received enhanced low- level southwesterly flow. An environment of weak wind shear in the wake of the typhoon allowed a new area of low pressure to form within the southwesterly flow on May 21\\\\. With convection becoming persistent and the system's overall presentation more organized by May 22, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300 UTC. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Later that day, convection wrapped entirely around the center of circulation; this structural improvement, combined with nearby surface observations, prompted the JTWC to designate the system as Tropical Storm Cecil. Initially, Cecil was forecast to maintain a northward track into a weakness in a subtropical ridge left behind by Typhoon Brenda; however, Cecil turned westward on May 23 due to another ridge over China. With favorable atmospheric conditions, Cecil continued to intensify through May 24\\\\. By 0600 UTC, a ragged 75 km (45 mi) wide eye developed over the center of circulation, indicating it had become a typhoon. The storm ultimately attained peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) while situated just off the coast of central Vietnam. However, the JMA reported Cecil to have been slightly weaker, classifying it as a severe tropical storm with ten- minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph). Around 1800 UTC (just after midnight on May 25, local time), the storm made landfall near Hoi An with winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). Once onshore, Cecil quickly weakened to a tropical depression. Turning slightly to the west-northwest, the remnants of Cecil continued inland before dissipating over eastern Laos early on May 26. Impact and aftermath In addition to the considerable losses that took place in Vietnam, Cecil also produced heavy rains in Laos and northeastern Thailand, resulting in flooding and crop damage. =Vietnam= Tropical Storm Cecil was regarded as the worst storm to strike Vietnam in 50 years. In some areas, rainfall exceeded . Approximately 105,600 hectares of rice and other crops were destroyed and another 78,300 hectares were otherwise inundated. About 7,500 metric tons of rice seeds were also lost. The hardest hit areas were in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province, where damage reached ‚Ç´300 billion ($71.7 million). The storm destroyed at least 10,000 homes were destroyed and damaged another 27,000 buildings, leaving an estimated 336,000 people homeless. Approximately 60 percent of the forests and forestry nurseries in the province were ruined. By June 5, 151 people were confirmed dead across the country with another 600 missing. Eventually, the death toll was revised to 751 as all missing persons were considered dead. In the wake of the storm, Vietnamese soldiers were deployed to rescue survivors. Local police forces were also stepped up to prevent looting. On June 5 government also requested international assistance to deal with the scale of the disaster. However, this was later retracted on June 16, though spontaneous donations were appreciated. The governments of Australia and France provided Vietnam with $75,188 and $73,964 in funds respectively. Additionally, the Swedish Red Cross donated clothing, which was later distributed by the local Red Cross along with medicine and relief supplies. A total of ‚Ç´52 million ($124,000) worth of funds and relief supplies, including of fabric, and two tons of clothing, was sent to Quang Nam province.

Broadcroft Quarry is an active stone quarry and part butterfly nature reserve located on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is located towards the eastern side of the island, where it lies to the east of the village Easton and close to The Grove village. The reserve section is now a valued home for a number of butterfly species, while the working quarry area is one of the largest active quarries on Portland and has supplied London with natural Portland stone for many years. The quarry is owned by Portland Stone Firms Ltd, along with Perryfield and Coombefield Quarries. The firm is the largest landholder on the island. The nature reserve is managed by Butterfly Conservation. King Barrow Quarry, located close to the area of New Ground, in the north-east corner area of Tophill, is also another Portland nature reserve. Perryfield Quarry is also a part butterfly reserve. Broadcroft links with the now-redundant Yeolands Quarry, to the east, situated on the far eastern side of Portland. History Part of the nature reserve with HM Prison Portland, a Young Offenders Institution in the distance. Originally, Broadcroft Quarry had been worked for many years since the beginning of the 20th century in the form of a number of smaller individual family run quarries which eventually merged to form a large quarry. In the past quarrying for aggregate was undertaken below the dimension stone beds down to the Portland clay, where Broadcroft was the only area on Portland where the full stratigraphical column could be viewed. Planning consent for modern day quarrying on Portland was granted in 1951, covering 324 hectares of the island. Portland Stone Firms Ltd received and still holds the planning consent for Coombefield, Perryfield and Broadcroft. In recent times, expansion into the north western area of Broadcroft is taking place to meet the rolling contract for Commonwealth War Graves Commission amongst other projects. The quarry has over 20 years of reserves left, which is privately owned by the stone firm, and as such is still being actively quarried. It is largely quarried for Broadcroft Whitbed stone.http://www.stonefirms.com/portland-stone-range/broadcroft-whitbed/ =Motorbiking use= On 13 November 2011, Portland Stone Firms Ltd held a Track 'n' Trail Enduro Event in the working part of the quarry. It was the first event of its kind and attracted many enthusiasts around the UK, many of which whom rated the contest as one of the toughest and most enjoyable in the UK afterwards. The Track 'n' Trails aim is to organise events to give youth and adult riders a safe and professionally organised way to enjoy the experience. Nature reserve In recent years, an abandoned, infilled area of the quarry had become reclaimed by nature and wildlife. It became a designated nature reserve and is now known as Broadcroft Quarry Nature Reserve or Broadcroft Quarry and Butterfly Reserve. It has been leased by the Butterfly Conservation organisation from the quarry company owners since 1994. Spanning 7.3 hectares (18 acres), the project of restoring the area involved care in returning natural herb-rich flora and scrub to the landscape, which in turn brought many indigenous birds, butterflies and insects. The reserve now supports a wide array of wildlife, and is an example of how brownfield land can be managed for nature conservation.http://www.dorsetbutterflies.com/places/reserves/reserve- broadcroft.html The reserve is part of Portland's Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Broadcroft is one of two nature reserves managed by Butterfly Conservation on Portland; the other, Perryfield Quarry, is close by and somewhat smaller, having become a reserve, four years after Broadcroft, in 1998. The site's management provides open grassland and short sward conditions. With the use of innovative surface-scraping, the team management have re-recreated the conditions needed by the silver-studded blue butterfly and the black ants with which it is associated. In April‚ÄìMay 2011, a conservation team from Weymouth spent six weeks snipping, sawing and burning up unwanted scrubby bushes at the nature reserve at Broadcroft Quarry in order to improve the habitats for butterflies and moths. The group also worked with a digger to scrape off the surface on part of the reserve to create the bare- ground habitat that the rare silver-studded blue butterfly needs to survive. The project was funded through the Awards for All strand of the Big Lottery. As a follow-up, Butterfly Conservation held a public event at Broadcroft Quarry over the first weekend of July to show visitors some of the butterflies and moths there. =Wildlife= The reserve features a wide range of plants and animals ‚Äì mainly insects, also hosting flora and fauna specific to limestone soil. The stony, calcareous soil supports a herb-rich flora with local plants such as bee and pyramidal orchids, cyperus sedge, yellow vetchling, autumn gentian, tutsan, wild madder, tree-mallow, dwarf gorse and ivy broomrape.http://www.natureofdorset.co.uk/sites/broadcroft-quarry-nature- reserve The quarry's sparse vegetation conditions hold the butterflies and other insects. There are over twenty-four different species of butterfly to be seen in the reserve. Most notable is the silver-studded blue (seen in late June/early July), which remains very abundant in the area, having established a colony on the limestone. Some other butterfly species include small blue (seen in May/June and July/August), chalkhill blue (seen in July), a very strong population of the common blue (seen from May to September), while migrant species such as clouded yellow and painted lady have been seen in the area. Moth species include Portland ribbon wave, four-spotted moth, chalk carpet, beautiful gothic and valerian pug. Aside from insects, which include the meadow grasshopper, migrant birds are also found in the area, either arriving or leaving via Portland. The scrub at the reserve provides shelter and habitat for them, although it also readily invades the open areas. Some bird species include whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, meadow pipit, kestrel, green woodpecker amongst other migrant birds. On occasion both roe deer and the herd of feral goats that help to graze the cliffs on East Weares may be seen in the area. On the eastern edge of the quarry are some ponds which hold various amphibian species. The ponds are some of the very few that can be found on Portland.

The company was launched in 2012 by Daniel Rajkumar. The first loans were completed in February 2013. Operation The rebuildingsociety.com website operates as a lending platform by allowing approved businesses to publish a loan application. Investors can subscribe to parts of the loan after assessing the business's information, committing an amount of their choice, with an interest rate of their choice. rebuildingsociety.com was one of the early P2P lending platforms to have launched in the UK prior to the regulation of the industry. Research by rebuildingsociety.com in late 2013 found SME owners were still largely unaware of peer-to-business lending and rely on personal borrowing to support their businesses. According to the study, about 290,000 SME owners would use their personal credit cards to raise money, similar numbers will borrow from friends and family, and about 500,000 SME owners will be remortgaging their own home. Potential returns Because investors choose which businesses and at what rate they lend, returns can vary considerably. As of 12 January 2014, the average interest rate payable to lenders from 25 loans completed was 15.57% gross. Earnings are reduced by any defaults which are forecast to be up to 7% depending on the risk appetite of the lender.Elaine Moore (26 July 2013) \\"Risk and reward in the p2p revolution\\". Financial Times. Risks and rewards As with other peer-to-peer lending companies, if a borrower fails to fully repay the loan the lender risks losing money invested. Defaults can be expected and lenders should understand that any recovery process may be lengthy, and even then there is no guarantee of success. Rebuilding Society requires that businesses wishing to borrow money have a minimum of two years trading history and an annual turnover of at least ¬£150,000. Investment capital is at risk, so investors are encouraged to give very careful consideration to each lending prospect by accessing and properly assessing both free and pay to view data sources external to the Rebuilding Society lending site itself. Given the higher risk nature inherent to P2B lending fund allocations will take time and should be made with a view to diversity. In summer 2019 rebuildingsociety launched the P2P BuyBack Guarantee, allowing sophisticated and HNW lenders to sell, for a premium, microloans with a guarantee to buy them back if the loan falls 60 days behind with its repayments. Regulation The Financial Conduct Authority (successor to the Financial Services Authority) undertook to regulate the peer-to-peer lending industry from April 2014. With assistance from Kylie-Jo Greeff, Richard Farr and Jay Tikam, Rebuilding Society participated in responding to various consultation papers to help shape the regulatory framework for the industry. As of 22 February 2017, Rebuilding Society transitioned from interim permission to full FCA authorisation, with the following permissions: * Operating an electronic system in relation to lending * Client money Pensions and ISAs In 2014, the UK government announced it was considering setting up a separate type of tax-free individual savings account (ISA) for people who want to lend out money. The new ISA would be for people who lend money via peer-to-peer borrowing sites. Rebuilding Society opened IFISA (innovative finance ISA) pre-registrations in March 2017. In January 2015, rebuildingsociety.com announced a new partnership with SIPPclub, which will allow qualifying Rebuilding Society investors to invest through a specially-designed self-invested personal pension (SIPP). The platform‚Äôs investors will be able to invest via an EvolutionSIPP. All investments made through a SIPP are tax-free ‚Äì meaning participating investors will stand to recoup higher rates of interest through the Rebuilding Society platform. Growth and maturity The UK industry is set for rapid growth as one in four savers is ready to invest according to industry research undertaken by rebuildingsociety.com. Non-bank lending grew at its fastest rate since 2008 in the year to October 2013, with over ¬£10.5bn of credit arranged through peer-to-peer lending, invoice discounting, asset finance and leasing. rebuildingsociety.com passed the ¬£1m of lending mark in October 2013 As of 14 August 2014, total advances stood at around ¬£3.5m, while in January 2015 it passed ¬£5m of loans completed. . In August 2016, total lending surpassed ¬£10.4m, As with most maturing P2P lending platforms, Rebuilding Society has seen an increase in defaults. The platform works to recover any non-performing loan by taking legal action against defaulting borrowers and enforcing the security provided to recover the outstanding debt.

(53 cm x 75 cm) Mary Impey (2 March 1749 - 20 February 1818) was an English natural historian and patron of the arts in Bengal. The wife of Elijah Impey, the Chief Justice of Bengal, she established a menagerie in Calcutta and commissioned Indian artists to paint the various creatures. Biography Born Mary Reade in Oxfordshire, she was the eldest of the three children of Sir John Reade, 5th Baronet, of Shipton Court, and his wife Harriet.John Reade (1721‚Äì1773) was the 5th Baronet of Reade. On 18 January 1768, at Hammersmith parish church (Fulham North Side) then just outside London, she married a thirty-six-year-old barrister, Elijah Impey, and over the next five years bore him four children. In 1773, Elijah Impey was made chief justice of Fort William in Bengal and the couple moved to India, leaving the children with their father's brother in Hammersmith. In 1775, having settled in Fort William, Impey started a collection of native birds and animals on the extensive gardens of the estate, which had formerly been that of Henry Vansittart, governor of Bengal from 1760 to 1764. Paintings Beginning in 1777, Impey and her husband hired local artists to paint birds, animals and native plants, life-sized where possible, and in natural surrounds. The collection, often known as the Impey Album, is an important example of Company style painting. She also kept extensive notes about habitat and behaviour which were of use to later biologists. The three artists who are known were Sheikh Zain al-Din, Bhavani Das, and Ram Das. More than half of the over 300 paintings made were of birds. The collection was dispersed in an auction in 1810. Family Between 1775 and 1783, Impey bore four more children, three of whom survived to return with them to England when her husband was impeached. She bore one more child back in England. Her husband died in 1809 and she died in 1818 at Newick Park, near Lewes, East Sussex, and both were buried in a family vault at St Paul's, Hammersmith, London. They are commemorated in the church with a wall monument by Peter Rouw. The Himalayan monal (Lophophorus impejanus) was named 'Impeyan pheasant' in her honour. A portrait of her by Thomas Gainsborough sold for 2,800 guineas (¬£2,940) at a Christies auction in 1904. The portrait is now in Furman University.

The album was released during a craze for calypso music catalyzed by Harry Belafonte the previous year. Angelou sings every song on the album, and she composed five of them. Behind Angelou's voice, studio guitarist Tommy Tedesco and percussionist Al Bello created an exotic mood. Angelou toured in support of the album, performing calypso songs in nightclubs. The album was a modest success but Angelou did not make any further records as a singer. Angelou later gained fame as an author and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman, she downplays her singing career and assigns little importance to Miss Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD during a period of customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots. Background Maya Angelou had modest success as a singer, dancer, and performer beginning in 1954, when her marriage to her first husband, Tosh Angelos, ended. She performed in clubs around San Francisco, including the Purple Onion, where she sang and danced calypso music. Up to that point she went by her birth name Marguerite Johnson, or by the name Rita, but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters, she changed her professional name to \\"Maya Angelou\\", a \\"distinctive name\\" that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955 Angelou toured 22 countries, mostly in Europe, with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess, which she describes in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976). By February 1956 she was touring with her own new show, an exotic calypso act which played at the Keyboard in Beverly Hills, where she was \\"wooed by disk executives\\", according to Billboard.(February 15, 1956) Variety(February 16, 1956) Variety She headlined at the Village Vanguard in March, gigged for four weeks at the Clouds in Honolulu in July‚ÄìAugust, and joined the Lester Horton dancers for a Halloween show at the Palladium.(March 21, 1956) Variety(July 18, 1956) Variety(October 12, 1956) Variety Angelou signed with Liberty Records in September. By November 1956, Variety was describing the process of recording her first album, Miss Calypso, and even speculating that her second album might be a collection of No√´l Coward songs, based on her playful ad-libbing of a Coward tune between takes at the recording studio.(November 28, 1956) Variety In 1957 Angelou appeared in an off-Broadway revue that inspired her first film, Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. Also in 1957, the album Miss Calypso was completed and released; it was reissued as a CD in 1995. According to reviewer Hilton Als, Angelou sang and performed calypso because she \\"had followed the fashion of the time\\", and not to develop as an artist. Als states about Miss Calypso: \\"But it was clear that the album itself was not the point. Developing her artistry was not the point. Fame, not art, was her spur...\\" In 1958, Angelou met jazz singer Billie Holiday, who after walking out during one of Angelou's calypso performances, told her, \\"You're going to be famous. But it won't be for singing\\". As she described in her fourth autobiography The Heart of a Woman, Angelou eventually gave up performing for a writing career, and became a poet and writer. According to Chuck Foster, who wrote the liner notes in the album's 1995 reissue, her calypso music career is \\"given short shrift\\" and dismissed in the book.See Angelou, p. 55. Her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), brought her international recognition and acclaim. Artwork Richie Unterberger of AllMusic described the album's cover as featuring Angelou \\"draped in a slip of a red dress, gyrating next to a fire in the middle of a (almost definitely fake) jungle\\". After finding it in a used record bin in 1994, Chuck Foster featured the cover in his column in Beat Magazine. Foster considered the cover as one of the best examples of the calypso era. He described the cover art in this way: \\"A barely draped young Maya gyrates around a bonfire from which the flaming title emerges\\". Reviews Miss Calypso was a modest success. Billboard review of the album said, \\"[Although] calypso addicts will question the authenticity of this package, Miss Angelou has enough sell in her voice to offer dealers a promising set. Selections include such oldies as \\"Run Joe\\", \\"Stone Cold Dead in the Market\\", and \\"Calypso Blues\\", all of which are handled with finesse. Singer's name value is a rising commodity via her nitery dates, and should increase some as a result of this wax\\". Unterberger wrote that the 1995 reissue of the album was \\"probably motivated by the exotica-space age pop revival\\". He called the album's music \\"more or less straight-ahead pop- calypso\\" that was \\"not that strange or cheesy\\". He complimented Angelou's performance, saying that she \\"sung with respectable gutsiness\\", and compared the album to Harry Belafonte's calypso recordings of the same era. Variety reviewed one of Angelou's live calypso performances, a gig in Chicago at Mr. Kelly's nightclub during much of December 1956.Stef (December 12, 1956). Variety Hal Spector quoted the review in the album's 1957 liner notes. Stef, the Variety reviewer, called Angelou's act \\"sizzling\\" and a \\"unique creation in the jazz world when everything progressive is expected to be on the cool side\\". He called the song \\"Polymon Bongo\\" \\"recitative\\" and complimented its conversational nature with the drums. He commented on the intimacy and sharpness in Angelou's performance of \\"The Heat is On\\", a song she wrote but one that does not appear on the album. He called \\"Calypso Blues\\", written by Nat King Cole and Don George, \\"an artfully simple welding of idioms\\" and another song she composed, \\"Scandal in the Family\\", \\"standard Trinidad calypso stuff\\" and reported that her performance of it \\"rocked the house\\". Spector, also in the album's 1957 liner notes, reported on another of Angelou's concerts in the Beverly Hills nightclub The Keyboard, when she performed many of the songs on Miss Calypso.Specter erroneously reported on some of Angelou's biography, stating that she was born in Cuba, that her father was a tall native African, that her mother was short, and that she had been the lead in Porgy and Bess. He called her a polite, soft-spoken, calm, and poised young woman \\"that completely mystified the audience\\". He found that Angelou's performance made an indelible impression and that she had an unusual voice and striking appearance. Spector stated, \\"She had captured the audience swiftly and effectively with her calm and affectionate manner\\", and promised that she would do the same for listeners of the album. He also predicted that she was \\"destined to become a very big name in show business\\". Spector characterized Angelou's music as \\"calypso style with a liberal sprinkling of Afro-Cuban, and a dash of blues mixed together with delicate jazz\\". Foster, in the album's liner notes its 1995 reissue, called the music \\"fresh as the day it was recorded and entirely captivating\\", but that it followed the tradition of the calypso of its era. He described the album's genre as having \\"Jazz, Afro-Cuban rhythms, Odetta-style folk\\", with \\"gospel and blues voicings and Belafonte- influenced Caribbean flavors\\". Foster considered Tommy Tedesco's guitar and Al Bello's percussion as having a \\"Beat-era spiritual sound\\". He thought that Angelou brought out the best in the calypso standards \\"Peas and Rice\\" and \\"Run Joe\\", but that she reached her peak with \\"Scandal in the Family\\", all of which he found as authentic as the songs she wrote. He stated that two of the songs Angelou wrote, \\"Mambo in Africa\\" and \\"Neighbor, Neighbor\\", effectively combined her skills as a poet and composer. He compared her music with other calypso artists of the same era, but considered hers more \\"uptown\\" and more like the music of modern artists such as Tracy Chapman. Foster also compared Angelou's music in Miss Calypso with her later writing, and called both \\"hot and spicy, peppered with a roots flavoring\\". Jessica Letkemann of Billboard stated that Angelou's tuneful and distinctive voice would \\"serve her so well in later years as a spoken word artist\\".

Its based at Air Base No. 11 (, BA11), at Beja, and operates the Sud Aviation SE.3160 Alouette III in transport and helicopter instruction roles.  Mission  It has the primary mission of executing tactical air transport operations and the secondary missions of providing basic and complementary flying training in helicopters, providing combat air support, executing general air transport operations and executing search and rescue operations. In addition to providing helicopter instruction for the Air Force, the squadron also has trained pilots of the Navy's helicopter squadron and pilots and ground crews of the Army's UALE.  History  Created on 24 November 1978, the 552 Squadron has inherited the traditions of all former Portuguese Air Force squadrons that operated the Sud Aviation Alouette III. After the Carnation Revolution a major reorganization occurred in the Portuguese Armed Forces with many helicopters squadrons returning from the oversea colonies and being assigned to 33 Squadron based at Air Base No. 3 (BA3) and to the Helicopter Group () of Air Base No. 6 (BA6). In 1978 another reorganization in the Air Force lead to the renaming of the 301 Operational Group () to 301 Operational Group, with the new formed 111 Squadron ‚Äî dedicated to Aviocar and Alouette III training ‚Äì and 552 Squadron, and the 61 Operational Group (, GO61), with the 551 Squadron (Alouette III) and 751 Squadron (Sud Aviation Puma). Upon its creation 552 Squadron's primary missions was tactical air transport, airborne operations, medical evacuation, special operations, and logistic air support, as well the secondary missions of general air transport and offensive operations of close air support. In 1982, the Rotores de Portugal helicopter flight demonstration team was reactivated in 552 Sqn. with two helicopters, having the team been originally integrated in 33 Squadron when created in April 1976. During the early 1990s the team was integrated with 111 Sqn., operating three helicopters. With the disbandment of 551 Squadron in October 1986, all personnel and helicopters of that squadron are transferred to the 552 Squadron, which also receives from that squadron the secondary mission of search and rescue (SAR). 552 Sqn. also inherited the SAR detachment then maintained by 551 Sqn. at Maneuvers Airfield No. 2 (, AM2; former Air Base No. 7, BA7), in Aveiro; this SAR detachment was later deployed to Maneuvers Airfield No. 1 (AM1) at Ovar. At this time PoAF had 26 operational helicopters. On 18 November 1993, 552 Sqn. was moved to Air Base No. 11 (BA11), in Beja, due to the deactivation of BA3 on 29 December 1993. In 2005, the Rotores de Portugal were reactivated in 552 Sqn. with three helicopters. = Lineage = * Constituted as Esquadra 33 (33 Squadron) in 1970 : Disbanded in 1978 * Reformed as Esquadra de Transporte T√°ctico 552 (552 Tactical Transport Squadron) on 28 November 1978 : Re-designated: Esquadra 552 (552 Squadron) in October 1986  See also  * Portuguese Air Force * Portuguese Colonial War * Rotores de Portugal * Exercise Real Thaw * 41 Squadron * 111 Squadron * 122 Squadron * 402 Squadron * 551 Squadron * 703 Squadron * 752 Squadron  References  External links  * Esquadra 552, official website Portuguese Air Force aircraft squadrons Military units and formations established in 1978 ","title":"552 Squadron (Portugal)"},{"id":"38687090","text":"Fl√®che was a French corvette built by Louis-Hilarion Chapelle (cadet) and launched at Toulon in 1768.

French service and capture Fl√®che was a French corvette built by Louis- Hilarion Chapelle (cadet) and launched at Toulon on 19 October 1768. In 1776, she was under Lieutenant Durfort, part of the squadron under Du Chaffault. In the early 1790s she was stationed at Smyrna. In April 1790, while under the command of major de vaisseau chevalier de Lestang-Parade, she sailed on a mission to Saloniki, and then to Largenti√®re. She then returned to Toulon via Paros.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.21. Between 12 May and June 1792, while under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Blanquet Du Chayla, she sailed from Tunis southward via Cerigo and Largenti√®re.Fonds, Vol. 1, p.33. The British captured Fl√®che on 21 May 1794 at the fall of Bastia. The French proposed in the articles of capitulation that the French Republic retain Fl√®che and a pink to transport the garrison, such civilians as wished to accompany them, and some timber, to France. The British refused, simply stating that they would provide any necessary transport. British service and fate The Royal Navy commissioned her as HMS Fleche under Commander John Gore upon her capture. He fitted her out and sailed her to Malta where he negotiated with the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc for seamen, supplies, and the like. On 13 September Gore was a witness at the trial of Lieutenant William Walker, commander of the hired armed cutter Rose, on charges that Walker had accepted money from merchants at Bastia to convoy their vessels to Leghorn, where the court-martial took place. Walker was acquitted.Byrn (2009), p.31-3. Gore received promotion to post captain on 14 November 1794.Annual Biography, (1837), Vol. 21, p.260/ Commander Henry Hotham replaced Gore, but then received promotion on 13 January 1795 to Mignonne. Lieutenant Thomas Boys replaced Gore in 1795, on Boys' promotion to Commander on 30 January 1795.United Service Journal, (1849), Part 1, pp.219-224. Under Boys, Fleche was one of the vessels that alerted the British fleet to the whereabouts of the French fleet in the run up to the battle of Hy√®res Islands, which was fought on 13 July 1795 off the Hy√®res Islands, a group of islands off the French Mediterranean coast, about 25 km east of Toulon. Fleche observed the battle from a distance. Lieutenant Charles Came replaced Boys. Fleche wrecked in the bay of San Fiorenzo in November 1795, but without loss of life. As she was entering the port during the night she grounded. The next day efforts to lighten her failed to free her and her crew left. By morning it was clear that she had capsized. The subsequent court martial castigated Came for his \\"great want of attention\\". Notes, citations, and references  Notes Citations References *The Annual Biography and Obituary (1837), Vol. 21.

Mechanical power is a medical term which is a measure of the amount of energy imparted to a patient by a mechanical ventilator. While in many cases mechanical ventilation is a life-saving or life-preserving intervention, it also has the potential to cause harm to the patient via ventilator-associated lung injury. A number of stresses may be induced by the ventilator on the patient's lung. These include barotrauma caused by pressure, volutrauma caused by distension of the lungs, rheotrauma caused by fast-flowing delivery of gases and atelectotrauma resulting from repeated collapse and re-opening of the lung. The purpose of mechanical power is to provide a quantity which can account for all of these stresses and therefore predict the amount of lung injury which is likely to be seen in the patient.

Highfield was a large house situated at 128 Selly Park Road in the Selly Park area of Birmingham, England. Built in the 1860s, it was bought in 1929 by Philip Sargant Florence and his wife Lella Secor Florence after Sargant Florence was appointed as a Professor at the nearby University of Birmingham. Under the Florence's ownership Highfield became a focal point for the cultural life of Birmingham in the 1930s, a period when the city was the focus of great intellectual ferment. Secor Florence let self-contained flats within the house out to other members of the university and held regular unplanned and informal parties for \\"huge numbers\\" of students, academics and other guests, that could involve anything from dancing, to picnics on the lawn, to skating on the frozen lake in the house's four acres of grounds. Highfield also formed a focus for political activity; in 1932 the dining room was converted into a studio where artists painted anti-war posters which were paraded through the city the following weekend, and in 1933 the house was the site of the rehearsals for the play DISARM!, performed at Birmingham Town Hall, whose cast was recruited from trade unions and factory dramatic societies. Highfield became a particular focus for local writers, and formed the centre of a vibrant literary circle that included the poets W. H. Auden and Henry Reed, the Birmingham Group novelists Walter Allen and John Hampson, the art historian Nikolaus Pevsner and the radio dramatist R. D. Smith. The poet Louis MacNeice lived in the flat above the coach house at the rear of the main house throughout his entire time in Birmingham, and the literary critic William Empson lived at Highfield while seeking a post at the University of Birmingham after his expulsion from Cambridge. The influence of Highfield also extended well beyond Birmingham. Walter Allen described how \\"Most English left-wing intellectuals and American intellectuals visiting Britain must have passed through Highfield between 1930 and 1950\\". Visitors from outside the city known to have stayed at Highfield included the philosopher G. E. Moore, the anthropologist Margaret Mead, the biologist Julian Huxley, the architect Walter Gropius, the politician Ernest Bevin, the American ambassador John Gilbert Winant, the poet Stephen Spender, the artist Robert Medley, the theatre director Rupert Doone, and the writers A. L. Rowse, Maurice Dobb, John Strachey and Naomi Mitchison. During the 1930s Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius was commissioned by Sargant Florence to design a modernist block of flats for Jack Pritchard's Isokon on a plot at the rear of Highfield on Kensington Road, but the plan was thwarted by local opposition. Highfield, and the literary culture that surrounded it, were the subject of a TV documentary by David Lodge in 1982. The house was demolished in 1984, and the site is now occupied by Southbourne Close.

It served as the basis for the creation of Antena 3 Televisi√≥n.  Foundation  Antena 3 was created on February 1, 1982, by La Vanguardia (51%) and ABC (13%), Manuel Mart√≠n Ferrand (5%), Europa Press and Grupo Zeta. The CEO was Manuel Mart√≠n Ferrand, and its president was Rafael Jim√©nez de Parga, later succeeded by Javier God√≥ (from La Vanguardia). The general director was Javier Jimeno, the Head of Programs was Jos√© Luis Orosa, and Jos√© Cavero was head of news.  Goals  The main goal of Antena 3 was to create a private television channel. That request was rejected in 1982, but then approved in 1989, when Antena 3 Televisi√≥n was created, joining both companies of radio and television.  History = Beginnings and consolidation = Antena 3 started broadcast nationwide on May 4, 1982. In 1984, they acquired Promotora de Televisi√≥n y Radio S.A. and its music station Radio 80, which became Radio 8 Serie Oro. On 1991, through Onda Musical S.A. they released another music station, Radiol√©. In 1989, they became the first Spanish media company on the stock exchange. On 1992, they went to number 1 on the EGM (3.139.000 listeners, beating Cadena SER with 3.007.000 listeners). = Arrival of PRISA and dismantling = On July 22, 1992, Prisa (owner of Cadena SER), bought 49% of Inversiones God√≥ and 51% of Patrielva, and therefore controlled 25% of Antena 3 Radio. At the end of 1992, fulfilling the Television Law, Antena 3 Radio sold their part of Antena 3 Television (12,49%), and therefore, the radio and television companies became independent from each other. On 1993, PRISA launched an IPO to acquire the share of stock. At the end of 1993, after some business movements, Prisa owned 80% of Antena 3 Radio through the constitution of \\"Uni√≥n Radio\\". Eight journalists from Antena 3 (Antonio Herrero, Manuel Mart√≠n Ferrand, Melchor Miralles, Pedro J. Ram√≠rez, Luis √Ångel de la Viuda, Federico Jim√©nez Losantos, Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a and Luis Herrero) would denounce this operation. The newspaper El Pa√≠s would criticize this denounce. Meanwhile, in January 1993, Radio 80 (owned by Antena 3) merged with Radio Minuto (owned by Prisa), creating M80 Radio. In May 1994, against the opinion of the Court of Competition, the cabinet council authorized the operation and creation of Uni√≥n Radio. = End of transmission = Therefore, on June 19, 1994, Antena 3 ceased its broadcast as a generalist station, and became \\"Sinfo Radio Antena 3\\", which would be dedicated to classic music. In 2000, the Supreme Court outlawed the 1994 operation, but the sentence never was executed. Finally, on March 29, 2002, Sinfo Radio Antena 3 ceased its transmissions and was substituted by M√°xima FM, dedicated to dance music.

Unlike the Free Belgian Forces which were raised in exile, the fusilier battalions were raised within Belgium after its Liberation from German occupation in September 1944. In total, 57 battalions (each numbered between 1-39 and 45-62) with a total of 53,700 men were raised between October 1944 and June 1945. Origins and creation The concept of the fusilier battalions originated in plans by the Belgian government in exile to rebuild the Belgian Army once its national territory was liberated from German occupation. In June 1943, they created a formal plan to raise 18 battalions of soldiers in Belgium once the territory was regained.. The core of the new force would be six battalions of front-line infantry to augment the existing Independent Belgian Brigade, known popularly as the \\"Piron Brigade\\" which had originally been formed in exile, and six battalions of fusiliers, intended to serve in auxiliary roles such as guarding lines of communication. A further six logistics (pionniers) battalions would be created. This was approved by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) in May 1944. Supply constraints, however, meant that the original targets were subsequently revised to create 12 battalions of fusiliers and four of pioneers, making a total of 6,000 men. The creation of the new units began after the liberation of Belgium in September 1944. By December 1944, 12 battalions had been raised with surplus British equipment. After the failure of Operation Market Garden, however, the Allies decided to review the agreement. In December 1944, the Allies signed an agreement on Liberated Manpower Units (LMU) that called for the raising of 77 battalions of fusiliers and eight auxiliary logistics battalions over two years. If completed, the agreement would have resulted in the mobilisation of 91,000 men. The fusilier battalions were each numbered between 1-39 and 45‚Äì62. In addition, the Belgian government had already begun a project of expanding the Piron Brigade into a new brigade of infantry, plus regiments of armour and artillery in a separate programme. In all, 57 of the planned 77 fusilier battalions were created before the programme ended on VE Day. A further four battalions of pioneers were created, as well as 34 companies of road transport and smaller auxiliary units. In total, 53,700 men served in the units. Many of those recruited into the battalions had been members of the Belgian Resistance, with 80 percent having been members of the right-wing Secret Army and National Royalist Movement groups. Although the majority were still in training at the end of the war, 20 battalions saw active service on the Western Front in the final months of the war. These included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions which served in the Netherlands, the 4th Battalion which was at the Rhine, the 5th and 6th which fought during the Battle of the Bulge, the 12th which participated in the Battle of Remagen, and the 17th which finished the war at Plze≈à in Czechoslovakia. From December 1944, the remaining fusilier battalions were formed into 16 \\"Fusilier Brigades\\".

He was the Minister of the Ministry of Education (MOE) of the Executive Yuan in 2012‚Äì2014. He is also the former President of National Central University in Taoyuan. ROC Education Ministry=Taiwan-run education centers in Vietnam closure= In February 2013, three Taiwan-run education centers in Vietnam specializing in teaching and teacher training on Chinese language were closed down due to financial difficulties. Initially they tried to share the cost between MOE and local institutions. However, the institution decided that the operation of these education centers were not cost-effective. However, in April 2013 Chiang reiterated ROC government continuing commitment in promoting Chinese language education overseas. Even the MOE official stationed in Vietnam said that if there is any institution interested in running the education centers, they can seek help from the ministry. =Retirement limit= In early May 2013, Chiang said that he will continue to push on a proposal for a limit on pension for retired public school teachers who still continue teaching at private school after his proposal was recently turned down by the Executive Yuan, in which the cabinet is in favor of having equal treatment for retired teachers, military personnel and civil servants. The proposal planned by Chiang will include a package of government reforms aimed at improving Taiwan's retirement insurance system for retired teachers, military personnel and civil servants, in which the current operating system is not sustainable enough for long term due to low contributions and high replacement rate. =Shoeing towards President Ma Ying-jeou= In end of October 2013, in response to the growing number of shoeing towards President Ma Ying-jeou, Chiang said that college students who want to express their views should do in a rational way instead of resorting to the inappropriate act of throwing shoes at leaders of government. They have the right to express their opinions about the government, but they should not throw shoes at anyone. Chiang added that people should treat each other with respect and engage in rational communication in order not to create a negative impact on Taiwan's democratic development. =National curriculum revision= In early 2014, the Ministry of Education proposed the revision of high school curriculum to be more China-centrist. Among the changes are to use the term Mainland China instead of China in referring to Mainland China, learn about Zheng Cheng-gong as Ming Dynasty ruler in Taiwan, the Dutch and Spaniard merely entered Taiwan instead of ruling it etc. Chiang said that everything is inline with the constitution of the Republic of China under the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area. As of February 2014, the policy has been passed and would be implemented in the next school year. =Resignation= On 14 July 2014, Chiang tendered his resignation to Premier Jiang Yi-huah over an alleged academic fraud.

The first execution order signed by Tseng was for four inmates on 30 April 2010.

MOJ was condemned because the ministry didn't inform the inmates' family members prior to the execution, and only did so after when they were informed to collect the dead body of their relatives. Even it was condemned by Amnesty International by saying the execution is \\"cold-blooded killing\\". On 17 April 2013, Tseng signed the order to execute the death penalty to the six awaiting inmates, in which the capital punishment order was executed two days later.

The offensive was a Croatian pre-emptive strike against the VRS, a Bosnian Serb military formed in May 1992 from Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) units that were stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The HV concluded that the JNA offensive operations of April and May 1992, resulting in the capture of Kupres and much of the Neretva River valley south of Mostar, were aimed at capturing or threatening the Croatian Port of Ploƒçe and possibly Split. To counter this threat, the Croatian leadership deployed the HV, under the command of General Janko Bobetko, to the \\"Southern Front\\" including the area in which Operation Jackal was to be conducted. The offensive marked the first significant Bosnian Serb defeat in the war and placed the HV in a favourable position to push back the VRS and remnants of the JNA holding positions north and east of Dubrovnik. The HV later re-established overland links with the city which had been under siege by the JNA since late 1991. The attack resulted in an HV/HVO victory and the capture of approximately of territory in and around Mostar and Stolac. Background In August 1990, a Serbian uprising occurred in Croatia centred on the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, as well as in settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. The areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). The RSK, supported by Serbia, declared its intention to integrate with Serbia, and was denounced by the Government of Croatia as a rebellion. Tensions rose and by March 1991 the Croatian War of Independence had broken out. With the disintegration of Yugoslavia, in June 1991 Croatia issued its declaration of independence which became official on 8 October after a three-month moratorium. The RSK then initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croatian civilians and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. In May 1991, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG), subsequently renamed the Croatian Army (HV) in November, was formed as a result of growing support for the RSK from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and the inability of the Croatian Police to cope with the situation. The establishment of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September. The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war culminating in the Battle of the Barracks, the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement was signed by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and a ceasefire called. After a series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions, and the JNA soon retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslavenska narodna armija ‚Äì JNA) withdrew from Croatia following the acceptance and start of implementation of the Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in Bosnia and Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February - 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak- dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations. Prelude Map of Operation Jackal In April 1992, the JNA renewed offensive operations against the HV and the HVO in areas of western and southern Herzegovina near Kupres and Stolac. The JNA's 2nd Military District, commanded by Colonel General Milutin Kukanjac, deployed elements of the 5th Banja Luka Corps and the 9th Knin Corps to the Kupres region, capturing the town from the HV and the HVO jointly defending the area in the 1992 Battle of Kupres on 7 April and threatening Livno and Tomislavgrad to the southwest. The 4th Military District of the JNA, commanded by General Pavle Strugar, employed the 13th Bileƒáa Corps and the 2nd Titograd Corps to capture Stolac and most of the eastern bank of the Neretva River south of Mostar. The fighting around Mostar and JNA artillery attacks on the city started on 6 April, with the town of ≈†iroki Brijeg coming under attack by the Yugoslav Air Force on 7-8 April. While a Croatian attack of 9 April failed to capture a JNA-controlled airfield in Mostar, the Bosnian Serb Territorial Defence Force captured two nearby hydroelectric power plants on the Neretva River and the JNA pushed the HV/HVO force from Stolac on 11 April. ƒåapljina, southwest from Mostar, came under intermittent JNA artillery and air attacks. A ceasefire was arranged on 7 May, but the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces resumed the attack the next day. The attack succeeded in capturing a large part of Mostar and some territory on the west bank of the Neretva River. On 12 May, the transfer of JNA forces based in Bosnia and Herzegovina to the VRS was completed, and those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia While the JNA planned the offensive to pre-empt a Croatian attack on Serb-held territory, Croatia saw the moves as a prelude to JNA attacks on southern Croatia, specifically aimed at the Port of Ploƒçe and possibly Split. To counter the perceived threat, the HV deployed additional troops to the area redesignated as the \\"Southern Front\\". HV General Janko Bobetko, appointed to command the Southern Front, reorganised the HVO command structure and assumed command of the HVO in the area to stop the expected JNA/VRS offensive and regain the lost territory along the Neretva River. In late May, Bobetko launched an attack along the Adriatic coast, and in its immediate hinterland, towards besieged Dubrovnik linking up with the HV force in the city and breaking the JNA encirclement of the city by 1 June. The attack coincided with a JNA withdrawal towards Dubrovnik Airport in Konavle and positions within Bosnia and Herzegovina borders, away from the coast. On 23 May, the HV/HVO captured the Hum Mountain south of Mostar. Order of battle The HV and the HVO committed 4,670 troops to Operation Jackal. The HVO deployed various units stationed or raised in the area, mostly drawn from Mostar, ≈†iroki Brijeg, and ƒåitluk. The HV contributed the 4th Guards Brigade, elements of the 116th Infantry Brigade and the 156th Infantry Brigade. The HV troops were deployed around ƒåapljina, for the main attack across the Neretva River and on the right flank of the axis, while the HVO troops were deployed to their left, as well as in the ƒåapljina area. The VRS Herzegovina Corps (former JNA 13th Bileƒáa Corps), commanded by Major General Radovan Grubaƒç, consisted of the 10th and 13th Brigades as well as Ljubinje Territorial Defence troops in the area of Mostar and Stolac. Timeline Operation Jackal, or alternatively Operation June Dawns, commenced on 7 June 1992. The attacking HV/HVO force moved east and north from ƒåapljina towards Stolac and Mostar aiming to push the VRS back from the Neretva River and capture positions around Mostar. The HV/HVO force captured the first objective of the offensive, the town of Tasovƒçiƒái located across the Neretva River, opposite ƒåapljina, on 8 June. The HV component of the force which captured Tasovƒçiƒái, the 156th Infantry Brigade, was detached from the force tasked with continued advance to capture Klepci and Prebilovci to protect the right flank of the Neretva bridgehead. The HV 116th Infantry Brigade held the Neretva River valley south of the bridgehead and east of Metkoviƒá. As the VRS Herzegovina Corps positions around Tasovƒçiƒái collapsed, the attacking forces were able to quickly move east along its planned line of advance. On 11 June, the Mostar HVO forces attacked VRS positions on the west bank of the Neretva River, south of the city of Mostar in support of the main attack. The advance was immediately successful, capturing the villages of Varda, Kru≈°evo, Jasenica, Slipƒçiƒái and the Orlovac Mountain. The HVO captured JNA/VRS Heliport Barracks in Mostar the same day. On 12 June, the HVO pushed all remaining VRS forces east across the river. The 1st Herzegovina Brigade of the HVO and the 156th Infantry Brigade advanced northeast from ƒåapljina and captured villages of Bivolje Brdo and Lokve away from the Neretva crossing point. The 116th Infantry Brigade, spearheading the Tactical Group-2, consisting of the brigade and supporting HVO troops, staged a rapid breakthrough and reached outskirts of Stolac, approximately east of the Neretva crossing. The advance northeast towards Mostar continued north through Pijesci and Gubavica and reached the southern approaches to Mostar on 14 June. HVO units attacking from ƒåapljina secured Stolac by capturing VRS positions in Hodovo, approximately north of Stolac, on 15 June. The same day, the 4th Battalion of the Mostar HVO captured JNA \\"Sjeverni logor\\" barracks in Mostar while other elements of the HVO Mostar force captured nearby Fortica Hill overlooking the city. The final part of the northward advance of the force that set off from ƒåapljina was routed through Buna and Blagaj villages, which were also captured on 15 June. In order to complete a link up with the advancing HV and HVO units, the Mostar HVO forces, supported by the HV's 4th Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade, moved south from the city through Jasenica. The two advancing forces met at the Mostar International Airport on 17 June. The HV and the HVO completely pushed the VRS from Mostar, advancing further east along the slopes of the Vele≈æ Mountain and capturing high ground overlooking the city by 21 June. The ARBiH supported the eastward push from the city only in a secondary role. Even though the front lines did not move significantly to the east, the city of Mostar was relatively secure from future VRS attacks. The offensive is considered to have ended on 26 June, when the HVO captured the Merd≈æan Glava peak of the Vele≈æ Mountain. Aftermath The HV and the HVO captured approximately of territory during Operation Jackal, and the supporting attacks around Mostar, as well as handing the VRS their first significant defeat in the Bosnian War. The offensive removed a direct threat posed by the JNA and the VRS to Metkoviƒá, and it accomplished the Croatian objective of capturing positions that were favourable to staging further offensives against JNA and VRS forces still positioned near Dubrovnik. The follow-up Operation Tiger was the first HV offensive to exploit the success of Operation Jackal and improve Croatian military positions on the Southern Front in general but specifically around Dubrovnik. HV deployment to Bosnia and Herzegovina not only gained them significant experience in the execution of large-scale military offensives, but also denied the Bosnian Serb VRS forces the chance to pursue a decisive victory.

It was designed to push the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) away from the city towards Popovo field and secure a supply route via Rijeka Dubrovaƒçka, which was gained in early June as the Siege of Dubrovnik by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) was lifted. The operation's success was facilitated by the establishment of the HV's Southern Front command and the successful conclusion of the MayJune 1992 operations against the VRS in the Neretva River valley, which concluded with Operation Jackal. Although Operation Tiger captured only of territory, it secured the PloƒçeDubrovnik road and placed the HV in a position to capture the rest of southern Dalmatia over the following three- and-a-half months. That was achieved through a negotiated JNA withdrawal from Konavle followed by a HV amphibious operation in the area of Cavtat--capturing Konavle before the VRS could move in and reach the Adriatic Sea coast. Two additional HV offensives aimed at securing the Dubrovnik area defencesOperation Liberated Land and an assault on the Vla≈°tica Peak-- stabilized the HV hold on the area and threatened VRS-held Trebinje in the eastern Herzegovina. As a result of the JNA pullback, the Prevlaka peninsula was demilitarized and placed under United Nations control until 1996. Background In August 1990, a revolution took place in Croatia; it was centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around the city of Knin, and in parts of the Lika, Kordun, and Banovina regions, and settlements in eastern Croatia with significant Serb populations. The areas were subsequently named the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). After declaring its intention to integrate with Serbia, the Government of Croatia declared the RSK a rebellion. By March 1991, the conflict escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. In June 1991, Croatia declared its independence as Yugoslavia disintegrated. A three-month moratorium followed, after which the decision came into effect on 8 October. The RSK then initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Croatian civilians, and most non-Serbs were expelled by early 1993. By November 1993, fewer than 400 ethnic Croats remained in the UN-protected area known as Sector South, and a further 1,5002,000 remained in Sector North. The Croatian National Guard (ZNG) was formed in May 1991 because the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) increasingly supported the RSK and the Croatian Police were unable to cope with the situation. The ZNG was renamed the HV in November. The establishment of the military of Croatia was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September. The final months of 1991 saw the fiercest fighting of the war, culminating in the Battle of the barracks, the Siege of Dubrovnik, and the Battle of Vukovar. In January 1992, the Sarajevo Agreement was signed by representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the UN, and fighting between the two sides was paused. After a series of unsuccessful ceasefires, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) was deployed to Croatia to supervise and maintain the agreement. The conflict largely passed on to entrenched positions and the JNA retreated from Croatia into Bosnia and Herzegovina, where a new conflict was anticipated. Serbia continued to support the RSK after the JNA pullout. As the JNA disengaged from Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army; Bosnian Serbs declared the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992. Between 29 February and 1 March 1992, a referendum on independence of Bosnia and Herzegovinawhich would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian Warwas held. Bosnian Serbs set up barricades in the capital Sarajevo and elsewhere on 1 March, and the next day the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In the final days of March, the Bosnian Serb army started shelling Bosanski Brod, and the HV 108th Brigade crossed the border adjacent to the town in reply. and on 4 April, Serb artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), under the control of the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the HVO. Prelude In April 1992, the JNA renewed its offensive operations against the HV and the HVO near Kupres and Stolac in western and southern Herzegovina. The JNA's 2nd Military District, commanded by Colonel General Milutin Kukanjac, deployed elements of the 5th Banja Luka Corps and the 9th Knin Corps to the Kupres area, capturing the town from the HV and the HVO jointly defending the area in the Battle of Kupres on 7 April 1992 and threatening Livno and Tomislavgrad to the south-west. The 4th Military District of the JNA, commanded by General Pavle Strugar, employed the 13th Bileƒáa Corps and the 2nd Titograd Corps to capture Stolac and most of the eastern bank of the Neretva River south of Mostar. The JNA attacked Mostar with artillery and fighting around the city started on 6 April, and the Yugoslav Air Force attacked ≈†iroki Brijeg on 78 April. A Croatian attack on 9 April failed to capture a JNA-controlled airfield in Mostar. On April 11, the Bosnian Serb Territorial Defence Force captured two nearby hydroelectric power plants on the Neretva River and the JNA pushed the HV/HVO force from Stolac. ƒåapljina, south-west of Mostar, came under intermittent JNA artillery and air attacks. A ceasefire was arranged on 7 May, but the JNA and the Bosnian Serb forces resumed the attack the next day. The attack captured a large part of Mostar and some territory on the western bank of the Neretva River. On 12 May, JNA forces based in Bosnia and Herzegovina became part of the VRS. Although the JNA planned the offensive to preempt a Croatian attack on Serb-held territory, Croatia saw the moves as a prelude to JNA attacks on southern Croatia, specifically aimed at the Port of Ploƒçe and possibly Split. To counter the perceived threat, the HV deployed additional troops to the area, now designated the \\"Southern Front\\". HV General Janko Bobetko, appointed to lead the Southern Front, reorganized the HVO command structure and assumed control of its forces in the area to stop the expected JNA/VRS offensive and regain the lost territory. In late May, Bobetko launched an attack along the Adriatic coast and in its immediate hinterland, towards besieged Dubrovnik, linking up with the HV force in the city and ending its encirclement by the JNA on 1 June. The attack coincided with the JNA's withdrawal from the area towards Dubrovnik Airport in Konavle and to positions within the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The border in this area is located from the coast. On 23 May, the HV/HVO captured Hum Mountain south of Mostar. Operation Jackalalso known as Operation June Dawns commenced on 7 June 1992. The attacking HV/HVO force moved east and north from ƒåapljina towards Stolac and Mostar, aiming to push the VRS back from the Neretva River and capture positions around Mostar. As the VRS Herzegovina Corps positions around Tasovƒçiƒái collapsed on 8 June, the HV/HVO advanced quickly in both of the planned directions. On 11 June, Mostar HVO forces attacked VRS positions on the western bank of the Neretva River south of Mostar in support of the main attack. The advance was immediately successful, gaining ground there, and in Mostar. On 12 June, no VRS forces remained on the western bank of the Neretva. By 15 June, the HV/HVO completed their capture of Stolac and the surrounding area, while the linkup of the HV/HVO forces approaching Mostar from the south, and those already in the city, was completed on 17 June. By 26 June, the HV/HVO advanced further eastwards along the slopes of Vele≈æ Mountain. Although the front lines did not move significantly to the east, Mostar was rendered relatively safe from future VRS attacks. On 10 June, in an operation codenamed Eagle 92 (), the HV tried to push VRS forces back from the high ground of Golubov Kamen, where the only road to Dubrovnik runs from the national border, and inside Bosnia and Herzegovina, dominating over Dubrovnik. The attack was not sufficiently organized and it failed. Order of battle The HV initially deployed 1,475 troops to conduct Operation Tiger. Although the VRS in the area had fewer troops, it had greater artillery firepower at its disposal and the advantage of defending in rugged terrain. Operation Tiger was executed by the HV's 1st Guards Brigade, reinforced with the special forces Zrinski Battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade, supported by the 163rd Infantry Brigade based in Dubrovnik, and additional HV troops brought in to hold positions captured by the guards brigades. Because of inefficient command structures in the reserve units, the HV's Southern Front command was forced to forge tactical groups out of multiple regular units. There was also a lack of manpower in individual reserve units because of their inadequately executed mobilization. To fend off any counter-attacks by the VRS Herzegovina Corpsspecifically the 472th Motorized Brigade stationed in the eastern Herzegovinathe positions captured by the 1st Guards Brigade were turned over to elements of the 115th Infantry Brigade, the 145th Infantry Brigade, the 148th Infantry Brigade, a battalion of the 156th Infantry Brigade and a company of the 102nd Infantry Brigade. Timeline Following the HV's failed attempt to push the VRS further away from Dubrovnik in early June, Bobetko planned another effort to secure the city, codenamed Operation Tiger. Another effort to capture Golubov Kamen at the head of the Rijeka Dubrovaƒçka embayment of the Adriatic Sea was made on 1 July. The initial attack, spearheaded by the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade, gained ground but the objective was not secured until 2 July, after VRS troops mounted a counter-attack. On the left flank of the 4th Guards Brigade, the 1st Guards Brigadereinforced with a special operations Zrinski Battalionwas tasked with capturing high ground on the southern rim of Popovo field. Their advance met stiff resistance and progressed slowly. By 10 July the 1st Guards Brigade reached its immediate objectives, consisting of numerous significant hills. By 13 July, it had covered approximately in the Dubrovnik hinterland, from the villages of Grepci and Visova to the road running through Srnjak village at the rim of Popovo field, north of Cavtat where their advance was halted. As the guards brigades reached their objectives, the newly gained ground was gradually turned over to reserve HV units. The 163rd Infantry Brigade, defending Dubrovnik during the JNA siege, took over positions captured by the 4th Guards Brigade. The 1st Guards Brigade was relieved and its territorial gains were garrisoned by elements of the 115th Infantry Brigade, the 145th Infantry Brigade, the 148th Infantry Brigade, a battalion of the 156th Infantry Brigade and a company of the 102nd Infantry Brigade. The VRS counter-attacked the reserve infantry on 9 July, causing losses and the withdrawal of the 102nd Infantry Brigade company east of Zavala and the 115th Infantry Brigade from Zavala and Orahov Do. The retreat created a gap in the HV defences, threatening the town of Slano, but the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade closed it. Days later, the 148th Infantry Brigade conceded some of the offensive's gains to another VRS counter-attack near Bobani. On 13 July, a platoon drawn from the 2nd Guards Brigade attempted to capture the Vla≈°tica Peak, but the attack failed, marking the end of Operation Tiger. Follow-up operations=Operation Liberated Land= Until 17 July, the VRS continued its attacks aimed at retaking territory lost in Operation Tiger, gradually pushing the HV back towards Dubrovnik. On 23 July, the HV 1st Guards Brigade counter-attacked north of Zaton, pushing the VRS north and east towards Popovo field. The attack, codenamed Operation Liberated Land (Croatian: Operacija Osloboƒëena zemlja), failed to cut off a battalion of the VRS 472nd Motorized Brigade deployed to Bobani, and the 4th Guards Brigade had to be deployed to mop up the area. Although substantial parts of the territory gained during the attack were surrendered to the VRS, the operation strengthened the HV defences in the area by 8 August. =Battle of Konavle= Prevlaka Fortress, overlooking the mouth of the Bay of Kotor In late July 1992, the HV, the VRS and the JNA began talks on the withdrawal of the JNA from the Dubrovnik Airport and the Konavle region east of Dubrovnik towards the Bay of Kotor. The talks were mediated by representatives of the UN and the European Union (EU). The JNA's main concern was retaining control in the area, and specifically on the Prevlaka peninsula at the entrance of the Bay of Kotor. The strategic importance of the bay increased in 1992 because it contained the last remaining Yugoslav Navy base after it lost all its bases in Croatia. The talks soon halted because the military commanders involved had no authority to resolve the political issues under discussion. Another round of peace talks mediated by the UN and the EU, this time between Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman and Yugoslav President Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá, produced an agreement on the JNA pullout by 20 October in return for the UN-monitored demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula. The agreement specified the removal of the JNA from Konavle and a buffer zone within Montenegro. The VRS began to plan replacing the JNA in the region, since the pullout would expose an unprotected flank of the VRS in Popovo field, and the HV planned to preempt the VRS move. The JNA withdrew from the area as agreed, leaving Croatian soil by 8:30 pm on 20 October. However, it was replaced by the VRS on the high ground overlooking the low-lying coastal plateau containing Dubrovnik Airport and the town of Cavtat. On 20 October, two Croatian police boats carrying Croatian Minister of the Interior Ivan Jarnjak, the EU monitoring mission's Lieutenant General David Cranston and journalists docked in Cavtat, but the VRS fired mortars at them. Bobetko appointed Major General Nojko Marinoviƒácommander of the HV during the Siege of Dubrovnikto perform a landing operation in the Cavtat area the same day. The first landing took place at 3:15 am on 21 October when the ferry Pelje≈°ƒáanka transported elements of the 5th Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade to Cavtat. The amphibious operation was also supported by the ferries Postire and Blace which landed tanks, and other personnel-transporting craft. The 5th Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade was joined that day by elements of the 1st and the 3rd Battalions of the same brigade. At 1:15 pm, the Pelje≈°ƒáanka was hit by VRS fire, but sustained only minor damage. After they landed in Cavtat, the HV moved towards the high ground to the north through Zvekovica and Uskoplje, east of Cavtat. The 1st Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade first reached the VRS positions at Gradina Hill, which quickly overrun and the battalion proceeded towards Jasenica, about north-east of Cavtat, reaching the village by the afternoon. On 21 October, the 5th Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade took positions in Stravƒça and Duba villages adjacent to the CroatiaBosnia and Herzegovina border in the north of the region, while the special police moved to the villages of Dubravka and Karasoviƒái in the east of Konavle near the Yugoslav border. The 3rd Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade advanced towards ƒåilipi and Gruda along the Adriatic Highway running through the centre of Konavle. The 2nd Battalion of the 1st Guards Brigade entered the area to secure the DubrovnikPlat road connecting the region with the rest of Croatia. In the afternoon, the HV deployed a battalion of reserve infantry drawn from Dubrovnik Home Guard, and on 23 October the 156th Infantry Brigade was deployed to relieve the 1st Guards Brigade troops protecting the national border. =Operation Vla≈°tica= On 22 October, as the HV neared completion of the operations to secure Konavle, the 4th Guards Brigade and the 163rd Infantry Brigade moved north-east from Dubrovnik and attacked the VRS positions closest to the city. The main HV attack, assigned to the 3rd and the 5th Battalions of the 4th Guards Brigade, was directed to capture Vla≈°tica Peak. The 1st Battalion and an independent armoured-mechanized company of the 4th Guards Brigade were deployed to draw off some of the VRS defences as they attacked towards the village of Cerovac and Hum railway station. The 163rd Infantry Brigade supported the main axis of the operation, advancing from ≈Ωupa Dubrovaƒçka towards Vla≈°tica. By 26 October, the VRS left flank in Popovo field collapsed and the town of Trebinje, the main Bosnian Serb centre in the region, came into jeopardy. However, Tuƒëman gave way to international pressure to halt the military operations around Dubrovnik and the fighting stopped by 1 November 1992. Aftermath Croatia-Montenegro border at Prevlaka in the Bay of Kotor area Operation Tiger captured only of territory around Dubrovnik, but it created a buffer zone around the city which increased its security. It also improved the security of the Ploƒçe-Dubrovnik section of the Adriatic Highwayespecially at Golubov Kamen and Rijeka Dubrovaƒçkaallowing the safer resupply of Dubrovnik. The subsequent negotiated withdrawal of the JNA from Konavle and the HV's rapid capture of the region before the VRS could move in, and other offensive operations in the Dubrovnik hinterland secured a Croatian strategic victory. The entire region of southern Dalmatia was brought under Croatian control, the siege of Dubrovnik was lifted and the city's safety was largely improved by the end of October 1992. However, that part of Croatia continued to suffer intermittent VRS artillery attacks until after Operation Storm in August 1995. In the wake of the 1995 Split Agreement and the large- scale deployment of the HV to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the HV General Staff planned to attack and capture a large part of eastern Herzegovina. The attackcodenamed Operation Burinwas formally ordered on 3 September 1995, and the HVO and the ARBiH were scheduled to join the attack. The operation was postponed on 17 September, but on 7 November was again ordered to be carried out should the Dayton peace talks fail. The plan was cancelled in early December 1995. The TuƒëmanƒÜosiƒá agreement on the pullout of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an emotional response in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal. Following the agreement, the Prevlaka Peninsula was demilitarized and placed under the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP), established by the UN Security Council Resolution 779 of 6 October 1992. The resolution placed the peninsula under the control of UNPROFOR. The UN Security Council Resolution 981 transferred control to the newly established United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia on 31 March 1995, and then to UNMOP through the UN Security Council Resolution 1038 of 15 January 1996. The UN mission there expired two months later. , the Prevlaka Peninsula remains demilitarized, with Croatian and Montenegrin police jointly patrolling the sea. The border in the area remains disputed between Croatia and Montenegro.

During Jin  Traditional histories ‚Äî including the official history Old History of the Five Dynasties and the chronicle Zizhi Tongjian ‚Äî did not give details on Ma Shaohong's family origins, or how he became a eunuch serving under Li Cunxu, other than giving his original family name of Ma.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 72.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. (The other official history of the period, the New History of the Five Dynasties, did not have a biography for him at all, making only a brief condemning reference to him at the end of the biography of his colleague Zhang Juhan.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 38.) At some point during his service of Li Cunxu, he was bestowed the Tang Dynasty imperial surname of Li (which Li Cunxu's grandfather Li Guochang had also been given), and thus became known as Li Shaohong. The first historical reference to Ma was in 919, when he was then serving, alongside the officer Meng Zhixiang (the husband of Li Cunxu's elder sisterWhile many historical resources such as New History of Five Dynasties, Zizhi Tongjian and The Autumn and Spring of the Ten Kingdoms referred Meng Zhixiang's wife as daughter of Li Cunxu's younger uncle Li Kerang, her epitaph referred her as the eldest daughter of Li Keyong and born by Empress Dowager Cao, thus she was the full eldest sister of Li Cunxu.), as a chief of staff (‰∏≠ÈñÄ‰Ωø, Zhongmenshi) for Li Cunxu, who was then the Prince of Jin, in Li Cunxu's capacity as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and Tianxiong (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) Circuits. In 918, Li Cunxu's highly regarded general Zhou Dewei the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing) had been killed in battle on Li Cunxu's campaign against Jin's archrival Later Liang. In 919, Li Cunxu briefly replaced Zhou with his cousin Li Sizhao, but soon thereafter, apparently believing that it was ill-advised to send Li Sizhao far away from his own Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), Li Cunxu personally assumed the command of Lulong, but sent Li Shaohong to Lulong to oversee the circuit in Li Sizhao's place. (Shortly after Li Shaohong's departure for Lulong, Meng resigned from the position of chief of staff, leaving Li Shaohong's and Meng's deputy Guo Chongtao as the new chief of staff.) In 921, when Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizu invaded Jin to assist the Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) rebels led by Zhang Chujin, it was Li Shaohong who defended Lulong's capital You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û) against the Khitan attack.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271.  During Later Tang = During Emperor Zhuangzong's reign = In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as Emperor Zhuangzong). Shortly after, he summoned Li Shaohong back from Lulong, apparently considering making him one of the two chiefs of staff (now renamed Shumishi. However, the ambitious Guo Chongtao did not want to again effectively serve under Li Shaohong (who was more senior), and therefore instead recommended a senior holdover eunuch from Tang Dynasty times, Zhang Juhan, to serve as chief of staff with himself. Instead, Li Shaohong was made the director of palace affairs (ÂÆ£ÂæΩ‰Ωø, Xuanhuishi). He thereafter resented Guo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. At that time, Later Tang was at a crucial juncture in Emperor Zhuangzong's long-term war against Later Liang ‚Äî while Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan had recently launched a successful surprise attack against Later Liang's Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), capturing it, the two states were largely stalemated on the Yellow River boundary. (Tianping was south of the Yellow River, but Later Liang had recently captured Later Tang's key garrisons Wei Prefecture (Ë°õÂ∑û, in modern Puyang, Henan) and Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ, in modern Hebi, Henan), north of the Yellow River, and Li Sizhao's son and successor Li Jitao had rebelled against Emperor Zhuangzong and submitted to Later Liang recently.) At that time, the Later Tang army's military supplies were low, and there were rumors of an impending major Khitan attack to the north. Li Shaohong advocated negotiating a peace accord with Later Liang ‚Äî exchanging Tianping for Wei Prefecture and Liyang, with the two states formally setting their boundary at the Yellow River. Guo opposed, however, believing that this was the time to use Tianping as a launchpad to destroy Later Liang. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed with Guo, and shortly after launched a surprise attack from Tianping against the Later Liang capital Daliang. Daliang was caught defenseless, and the Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang. Emperor Zhuangzong, while praising Guo and Li Siyuan for their contributions in this victory, did not demote or punish Li Shaohong. In 924, when Khitan did attack You Prefecture again, Emperor Zhuangzong, who had by that point established Luoyang as his capital, sent Li Siyuan north to defend against the Khitan attack, with Huo Yanwei serving as Li Siyuan's deputy and Li Shaohong as the monitor of the army. Shortly after, the Khitan army withdrew.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Shortly after, Guo, knowing that Li Shaohong resented him, tried to placate Li Shaohong by establishing the post of monitor of finances (ÂÖßÂãæ‰Ωø, Neigoushi) for Li Shaohong, to oversee the three financial agencies (which were responsible for taxation, treasury, and salt and iron monopolies). The move, however, did not appease Li Shaohong, and instead only created an additional layer of oversight for financial matters, which created more paperwork for the local governments. At that time, Guo himself was drawing resentment from many others due to his control on both military and political matters, and therefore tried to resign the chief of staff post and have it transferred to Li Shaohong, but Emperor Zhuangzong did not approve Guo's resignation. In 925, Emperor Zhuangzong wanted to launch a major attack to destroy Later Tang's southwestern neighbor Former Shu. He first requested Li Shaohong's opinion on the right commander for the army, and Li Shaohong recommended the former Later Liang general Li Shaoqin, who had flattered Li Shaohong. However, Guo opposed on the grounds that Li Shaoqin was wicked and had contributed to Later Liang's destruction, and also opposed Li Siyuan (on the grounds that Li Siyuan would be necessary to be available for defending against another potential Khitan incursion). Instead, Guo recommended putting Emperor Zhuangzong's oldest son Li Jiji in command. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed, and also made Guo Li Jiji's deputy, in actual command of the army. After Li Jiji and Guo conquered Former Shu shortly after, however, Emperor Zhuangzong's wife (Li Jiji's mother) Empress Liu came to suspect that Guo was planning to rebel and take the Former Shu territory for himself; she therefore ordered Li Jiji to put Guo to death, and Li Jiji did in spring 926. Shortly after Guo's death, Emperor Zhuangzong also executed another major general, Li Jilin, and the deaths of Guo and Li Jilin caused many mutinies throughout the realm, with many generals suspected of being complicit in those mutinies. Li Siyuan was frequently rumored to be involved, but Li Shaohong, who was friendly with him, protected him, so Emperor Zhuangzong took no actions against him. Meanwhile, after Guo's death, Li Shaohong became chief of staff.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Soon, a mutiny at the major city of Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, i.e., Tianxiong's capital) was causing Emperor Zhuangzong much concern. Li Shaohong again recommended Li Shaoqin to command the army against the Yedu mutiny, and Emperor Zhuangzong initially agreed. However, after Li Shaoqin selected many officers from the former Later Liang army ranks, Emperor Zhuangzong came to suspect him, and cancelled his commission. With many officials recommending Li Siyuan, including Li Shaohong and the senior official Zhang Quanyi, Emperor Zhuangzong instead sent Li Siyuan. When Li Siyuan got to Yedu, however, his own troops mutinied and forced him to join forces with the Yedu rebels. With his communication lines with Emperor Zhuangzong cut off, Li Siyuan decided to embrace the mutiny, and he advanced south toward Luoyang. Emperor Zhuangzong prepared to launch his own army from Luoyang to combat Li Siyuan, but as he was prepared to depart Luoyang, he was killed in a mutiny at Luoyang itself.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. = After Emperor Zhuangzong's death = When Li Siyuan subsequently arrived at Luoyang, many senior officials, including Li Shaohong, Zhang Juhan, the chancellor Doulu Ge and Wei Shuo, and the generals Zhu Shouyin, Fu Xi (Á¨¶Áøí), Huo (who was using the name Li Shaozhen at this point), Li Shaoqian, and Li Shaoying (ÊùéÁ¥πËã±), all tried to persuade Li Siyuan to take the throne.Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 35. Li Siyuan initially declined, but eventually agreed, taking the throne as Emperor Mingzong. After Emperor Mingzong took the throne, Li Shaohong requested that his former surname of Ma be restored. He died in 932.

He was the Minister of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications from 18 February 2013 until 9 January 2015, and one of the three deputy mayors of Kaohsiung within the municipal administration of Han Kuo-yu from 25 December 2018 to 12 June 2020. Early life Yeh Kuang-shih was born in Hualien City in 1957. His parents are immigrants from Zhejiang, China. He graduated from National Taiwan University with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1979. He then obtained a master's degree in public administration at University of Delaware in 1984, and a PhD in organization theory at Carnegie Mellon University in 1990. Academic career Yeh was a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Department of Business Administration from 1991 to 2015. He has more than 30 publications in peer-reviewed journals and has written several books on business administration. After resigning from his post as the Minister of Transportation and Communications in 2015, Yeh left Sun Yat-sen University for the Graduate Institute of Technology Innovation & Intellectual Property Management at National Chengchi University. He retired in 2018. Political career=Deputy Minister of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission= Yeh served as the Deputy Minister of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission from 2008 to 2009.

During this time, he instituted Taoyuan International Airport Corporation, the operator of the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, and served as the first chairman. =Minister of Transportation and Communications= After Premier Sean Chen stepped down in 2013, Yeh replaced Mao Chi-kuo as the Minister of Transportation and Communications. 2013 Nantou earthquake Right after an earthquake struck Taiwan on 27 March 2013, Yeh ordered all officials within the ministry departments to conduct checks on any damage caused by the earthquake. Taoyuan International Airport MRT delay Commenting on the completion delay of Taoyuan International Airport MRT in mid April 2013, Yeh said that he hoped that the line can be opened somewhere before October 2014, after the ROC Ministry of Transportation and Communications had postponed it from its original June 2013 official launch. He added that the delay is caused by the MRT electromechanical systems in which it is still currently being worked out by the appointed contractor. In early May 2013 during a session at the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan, Yeh became the target of heavy criticism due to the ongoing delay of the airport MRT completion, even the DPP asked Yeh to resign as his responsibility of the delay. Yeh responded by stating that he had already questioned the train signaling system contractor legitimacy and the tender process in choosing the contractors. He added that any dispute regarding the tender and bidding process had long been officially closed since the investigator could not find anything illegal. However, he promised to further submit all of the information found to prosecutor for further investigation. ROC first casino After the Executive Yuan approval in early May 2013 in establishing ROC first casino, Yeh said that ROC government considers that the casino will be established in Lienchiang, Fukien Province, not in Taiwan Island. He expected that the casino resort will house the casino, hotel, convention and other facilities. The casino resort is expected to be established in 2019 the earliest. Resignation On January 7, 2015, which happens to be Yeh's birthday, Yeh resigned after failure to secure support from his party to Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation‚Äôs (THSRC) financial restructuring plan. The plan was perceived by some lawmakers to benefit the investors more than the public, or unnecessary because THSRC is not in imminent danger to go bankrupt, or the government should let the corp go bankrupt. A modified version of the financial restructuring plan was passed later that year. Later that year, he became an adviser to Hung Hsiu-chu's presidential campaign. Hung was eventually replaced by Eric Chu to represent the party in the election. =Deputy mayor of Kaohsiung= Yeh was appointed deputy mayor of Kaohsiung in December 2018 by Han Kuo-yu, serving alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Chen Hsiung- wen.

The game features various characters from Blizzard's franchises as playable heroes, as well as different battlegrounds based on Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch universes. The game is free-to-play, based on freemium business model, and is supported by microtransactions which can be used to purchase heroes, visual alterations for the heroes in the game, mounts, and other cosmetic elements. Blizzard does not call the game a \\"multiplayer online battle arena\\" or an \\"action real-time strategy\\" because they feel it is something different with a broader playstyle; they refer to it as an online \\"hero brawler\\". Gameplay 265x265px Heroes of the Storm revolves around online 5-versus-5 matches, operated through Blizzard's online gaming service Battle.net, with the average duration of 20 minutes. In every match, players work together as a team to achieve the ultimate victory condition which is to destroy the opposing team's main structure, called \\"King's Core\\", before enemy team does the same. To reach the Core, at least one line of defensive structures, known as \\"forts\\" and \\"keeps\\", needs to be destroyed. Players can use the assistance of mercenary camps, battleground bosses, and a small group of computer-controlled units, called \\"minions\\", to assault enemy more efficiently. Minions periodically spawn throughout the game in groups, marching along the lanes toward the enemy base. There are currently 15 battlegrounds available to play, each of which has different meta and secondary objectives to secure. Completing these secondary objectives can give your team massive advantages, typically through pushing power. In all game modes, each player controls one of the 89 playable characters (as of June 2020), called \\"heroes\\", with each having a unique design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into six separate roles: tank, bruiser, ranged assassin, melee assassin, healer, and support. Initially, no heroes are permanently available for use; however, players may choose from a list of heroes that are free to use from a weekly rotation. By using the in-game currency, called \\"Gold\\", or through microtransactions, they can gain permanent access to a hero. Each individual hero comes with a diverse set of unique abilities. Ability kit is generally composed of three basic abilities usable right from level 1, a passive or active trait, and a powerful \\"heroic ability\\". Upon reaching level 10, players can choose between two \\"heroics\\" which often have a devastating effect and a long cooldown. Heroics are usually the strongest tools in an arsenal that define a hero's strengths and playstyle. A hero can only gain one type of heroic per match. If a hero runs out of health points and dies, he is removed from active play until a respawn timer counts down to zero, where he is then respawned in his base. Furthermore, a spawn point, known as \\"Hall of Storms\\", allows heroes to quickly restore their health and mana over time as long as they are within the Hall. The spawn point also offers protection from enemy damage and enemy team is not allowed to go inside of it. Experience points, which can be gained by being nearby enemy heroes and minions when they're killed, are shared across the entire team. In addition, certain enemy structures, such as towers, forts and keeps, will provide experience to the team who destroys them, as well as captured mercenary camps. When a team during the course of the match reaches a certain experience point threshold, every hero on that team levels up, acquiring slightly amplified powers, up to a maximum level of 30. Every few levels, players may select a \\"talent\\" which offers a new ability or augments an existing one. Two significant power spikes are at level 10 and level 20, where heroes gain access to an especially powerful set of abilities and talents, called \\"heroic\\" and \\"storm talents\\", respectively. This leveling system emphasizes the importance of teamwork and planning since a player's action can affect the whole team. In addition to the talent system, every player starts the game with an item called \\"Gladiator's Medallion\\". This item, which is available on a long cooldown, can be activated to make player's hero \\"unstoppable\\" for 1 second, making him immune to negative crowd control effects for that period of time. Each player is able to use a \\"Hearthstone\\", an ability that allows heroes to teleport back to their base from anywhere on the battleground after a few seconds of channeling. Players can also utilize various mounts, such as animals, bikes, and clouds, to increase their movement speed, automatically dismounting when attacking, receiving damage or using any ability. =Game modes= Heroes of the Storm includes several game modes players can select which include playing against computer-controlled heroes or other players. *Tutorials - The tutorials are composed of three scripted 'levels' that are aimed at new players with the intent of teaching movement, use of abilities and other basic controls. The player controls Jim Raynor, who is teleported from the StarCraft universe into the Nexus, receiving instructions from Uther Lightbringer from the Warcraft series. *Training - A reduced experience mode where a player teams up with four AI teammates against five AI opponents set at the Beginner difficulty. *Versus A.I. - Players face off against five AI opponents. Before starting the match, the player can choose to have human-controlled or AI allies. The AI difficulty can be chosen prior to initiating a match. *Quick Match - Players choose their heroes before entering the match without knowing what map they are playing, or what heroes they will be matched with and against. This mode sets two teams of five human-controlled heroes against each other on a random map in players versus players (PvP) style combat. These teams are selected based on the player's past performance to create an even playing field, as well as the roles of heroes chosen. For example, if a player queues without other party members as a Support, they are extremely unlikely to be matched with four other Support teammates. *Unranked - This is a draft mode where each team takes a turn choosing heroes, generally based on each hero's strength on that particular map and how well the hero works with the team composition. Each team can also ban three heroes so neither team can draft them for that match. Players will get the same practice of drafting as in Ranked Play, but without the additional stress that may come with Ranked Play. *Ranked - Storm League is a draft mode similar to Unranked Draft; however, players are placed in divisions from Bronze to Grand Master based on their in-game performance. Players who choose to play competitively as an individual or as a team of up to 5 players can play in a Storm League match to be matched with other players in their region. In order to play in Storm League, players must have access to 16 heroes at level 5 or higher (excluding Cho'gall) and have an account level of 50 or higher. As players compete in these matches, they will be awarded ranking points which will progress their League Rank and begin to place them in more challenging match-ups. Player rank is expressed in the form of League Tiers and Divisions, and this rank is assigned separately for each individual player. Rank is determined by the player's MMR directly and adjusted by penalties, such as Leaver Penalty. The first official Ranked Play season began on June 14, 2016, and ended on September 13. Each Ranked Play season is set to last for approximately 3‚Äì4 months. *Heroes Brawl - Added on October 18, 2016, this game mode has three different subcategories with varying rules. The rules of Heroes Brawl change every week: **Arenas - Players pick one of three randomly selected Heroes and try to complete the objective. The first team to complete the objective will claim victory. The first to win two rounds wins the match. There are multiple arena maps exclusively designed for this mode. **Mutators - Unique mechanics change the way you play on the already familiar Battlegrounds. **Single-Lanes - One-lane Battlegrounds with no objectives, or \\"hearthstone\\". * Custom Games - Often used for tournament play, players can create a lobby and make a predetermined match-up of up to five players versus five players, with the ability to choose the map, whether to enable draft mode, and whether to add AI-controlled heroes and/or allow up to six observers. =Matchmaking= Matchmaking is based on the Elo rating system with proprietary adjustments. MMR (matchmaking rating) is calculated individually for each player, and it is tracked separately for every game mode. In ranked mode matchmaker tries to place players with similar ratings together, while generally attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR to find and create even games. Business model Heroes of the Storm is free-to-play, based on freemium business model, and is supported by micropayments using three in-game currencies: \\"Gems\\", \\"Gold\\", and \\"Shards\\". Gold is in-game currency that can be earned by playing the game, completing daily, seasonal and event quests, and leveling up (Loot Chests can be acquired in the same way). Gold can be used to buy heroes, gold-only mounts, hero mastery rings, Loot Chests and Shards. Gems can be earned in-game or purchased with real money, and Shards are acquired from duplicate items from Loot Chests or purchased with Gold. Players can use either Gems or Shards to buy skins, mounts and other cosmetic elements, such as banners, sprays, announcers, voice lines, emojis, and portraits. Heroes, as the only category in Collection with a material effect on gameplay, may be purchased by either Gems or Gold. Gem- only items in Collection are \\"bundles\\" (dynamic groups of Heroes of the Storm content), and \\"boosts\\" (formerly called \\"stimpacks\\") which increase Gold and account experience earned per match. Development As a part of the arcade feature for StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, a custom map called \\"Blizzard DOTA\\" was announced alongside several other mods of Blizzard Entertainment at BlizzCon 2010. At that time, the map was developed to showcase the modding abilities that were to be added to StarCraft II. In 2011, however, development of Blizzard DOTA was rebooted and demoed at BlizzCon 2011. In comparison to the previous iteration previewed at BlizzCon 2010, the gameplay was described as \\"fast\\" and \\"streamlined.\\" Following the announcement of Dota 2 by Valve, Rob Pardo, the executive vice president of Blizzard Entertainment, expressed concern at Valve using and trademarking a name that originated from within the Warcraft III community. Following a failed trademark injunction on the part of Riot Games, Blizzard acquired Riot's subsidiary, DotA-Allstars, LLC., the original company that represented the servicing of Defense of the Ancients. Subsequently, Blizzard filed an opposition against Valve for claiming the DotA trademark. On May 11, 2012, Blizzard and Valve announced that the dispute had been settled, with Valve retaining the commercial franchising rights to the term \\"Dota\\", while Blizzard would change the name of Blizzard DOTA to Blizzard All-Stars. Blizzard, however, will retain the right to use DOTA name non- commercially. This includes promoting DOTA-style maps made for Blizzard games by the community. In June 2012, Dustin Browder, the director of StarCraft II, stated that Blizzard All-Stars did not have a release date, but that it would definitely be after the release of StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm. In an interview in January 2013, he noted that parts of the game were \\"starting to feel really good\\", with \\"a really tight multiplayer experience\\", but that there was no way to project a timeline on it, since it was not complete enough to run a company-wide internal alpha test. In February 2013, the Activision Blizzard fourth quarter 2012 earnings report listed Blizzard All-Stars as one of the areas of continued investment for Blizzard throughout 2013. Dustin Browder commented in March 2013 that a few artists had transitioned from the StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm team, to work on Blizzard All-Stars for the time being along with the few designers on the team. One of the significant challenges faced by art team, according to the senior art director Samwise Didier, was bringing in three different art styles and particular themes from Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo worlds in line to make what is now the art style for Blizzard's \\"hero brawler\\". In August 2013, Blizzard president Mike Morhaime said that the game had reached a significant internal testing milestone, and was going into wider internal testing. Describing it as an \\"action real-time strategy\\" game, he said that Blizzard was looking to put their own spin on the genre and challenge some of the existing design paradigms. The Blizzard All-Stars team was expanded in May 2013, from some of the resources who were reallocated when Blizzard's Titan project was rebooted and the team downsized. On October 17, 2013, the name of the game was changed to Heroes of the Storm. Heroes of the Storm entered a technical alpha testing phase on March 13, 2014, which went offline on September 22, 2014. The technical alpha went back online on October 7, 2014 for North America, Latin America, South East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The servers for Europe, Korea, China and Taiwan went online in the following weeks. The technical alpha continued until the beginning of the closed beta. Closed beta testing started on January 13, 2015. As of February 2015, over 9 million players had signed up for eligibility to receive an invite to beta testing. The open beta of the game began on May 19, 2015, and the full version of the game was released on June 2, 2015. =Post-release=Promotions While the game was in Alpha testing, Blizzard ran a promotion as part of the pre-order for Diablo III: Reaper of Souls which unlocked Valla as a free hero. To mark the release of Heroes of the Storm, Blizzard had crossovers implemented between Blizzard games. Players who reached account level 12 in Heroes of the Storm received the Heroes of the Storm themed card back in Hearthstone and after winning 100 play mode matches in Hearthstone received the Hearthstone Card mount in Heroes of the Storm. Players who reached account level 20 in Heroes of the Storm received a Grave Golem battle pet in World of Warcraft and after reaching level 100 in World of Warcraft received an Ironside Dire Wolf mount in Heroes of the Storm. After the Diablo hero patch, any player who purchased Diablo III was given the Diablo hero (Al'Diabolos) free for a limited time; players who reach level 12 in Heroes of the Storm will receive a unique pennant and portrait frame in Diablo III and reaching level 70 Season 4 and beyond receive Malthael's Phantom mount in Heroes of the Storm. Players who purchase the StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void deluxe or collector's editions receive a Void Seeker mount in Heroes of the Storm and purchasing any edition of Legacy of the Void unlocks the Artanis hero. Players who purchase the Origins Edition of Overwatch unlock Tracer as a free hero. During the Nexus Challenge event (November 15, 2016 ‚Äì January 4, 2017), each player who completed 15 games of Heroes of the Storm together with a friend received the Oni Genji skin, Oni Genji Portrait and Oni Genji Spray in Overwatch, and Zarya as a free hero in Heroes of the Storm. After completing 30 games with a friend, players unlocked four additional heroes (Auriel, Greymane, Kerrigan, and Li-Ming), the Orochi Hovercycle mount, and a 30-Day stimpack in Heroes of the Storm. During the For Azeroth! event (February 14, 2017 ‚Äì March 14, 2017, then extended for March 17, 2017 ‚Äì March 26, 2017), each player who completed 15 games of Heroes of the Storm together with a friend while playing as a Warcraft character, received a Flames of Judgement Charger mount and a 10-day stimpack to use in-game. They also received a Primal Flamesaber mount for World of Warcraft.

For each of the 4 weeks of the event, players who completed 5 matches with a friend could unlock various Overwatch-themed rewards for the players' Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch accounts. Heroes of the Storm 2.0 On March 29, 2017, game director Alan Dabiri announced Heroes of the Storm 2.0, described as \\"a culmination of all the ways Blizzard transformed the Nexus since launch, plus plenty of radical additions on their way\\".Developer Update: Heroes of the Storm 2.0 - YouTube A major feature of the patch was a revamp of the player and hero progression systems. The level caps (40 for players in general, and 20 for individual heroes) were removed, and the uneven experience curve for leveling heroes was smoothed out. Another feature was the introduction of Loot Chests which contain cosmetic rewards, similar to the system used in Overwatch. In addition to heroes, skins, and mounts, the chests can also include new portraits, banners, emojis, custom announcer voices (similar to StarCraft II), hero voice lines, and graffiti sprays (both similar to Overwatch). Loot Chests can be acquired by leveling up or purchased with Gold. The in-game shop was remodeled and retitled \\"Collection\\", and two new currencies, \\"Gems\\" and \\"Shards\\", were added in addition to the existing \\"Gold\\" which was the only in-game currency before Heroes 2.0 update. A loadout system for cosmetic additions was also included. As part of the announcement, a new Diablo hero, the Amazon Cassia, was highlighted. Heroes 2.0 went into beta testing on March 29, and was released on April 25. Downsizing On December 13, 2018, Blizzard announced that some developers from Heroes of the Storm would be moving to other projects, and that the game would be transitioning to a long-term support phase. Blizzard also announced the cancellation of their esports tournaments, Heroes Global Championship and Heroes of the Dorm. Members of the esports community around Heroes stated they were caught off guard by the announcement and had been told as recently as BlizzCon 2018 that HGC would continue. In a message posted on the game's official forums, production director Ka√©o Milker confirmed the game would continue receiving updates and new content, though at a slower pace than before.  Nexus Anomalies  Nexus Anomalies are seasonal gameplay changes that directly affect all game modes in Heroes of the Storm. These events will last the entire ranked season, allowing the developers time to receive feedback on them. Depending on this evaluation, some of the new game mechanics may become permanent additions to the game, while others may just be a limited-time event. Experience Globes are the first Nexus Anomaly which came with Deathwing patch in December 2019. Players will no longer get experience from simply being nearby, but instead need to gather an Experience Globe dropped by dying Minions, similar to the Regeneration Globes already present in the game. The following Nexus Anomaly was the \\"Gladiator's Medallion\\" which provided every hero with the ability to ignore negative crowd control effects for 1 second, once every five minutes. Before the introduction of the Nexus Anomalies, major gameplay updates were typically announced once a year.  Setting and plot  Heroes of the Storm takes place in the Nexus, a strange limbo of clashing universes, which collide from across space, time, and dimensions. The Nexus exists in the center of a trans-dimensional cosmic storm and is connected to other universes. The storm of the Nexus, which has incomprehensible amounts of energy, can rip worlds and universes in and out of existence, and it can also pull worlds into stability. Some of the central realms in the Nexus, such as Raven Court, King's Crest, and Luxoria, are examples of these points of stability. Every Realm within the Nexus has one stone called \\"Singularity\\", and only the one who achieves it through conquest can become the Realm Lord. A singularity stone grants to its possessor an almost demigod-like status, but not immortality. Many powerful warriors have been sucked into the Nexus, including combatants from Azeroth, Sanctuary, and the Koprulu sector. New combatants are constantly arriving, some of them are chosen after they died in their original reality. A hero called Qhira, came into the Nexus after her world Iresia and its singularity stone were destroyed, holding only a singularity shard from Iresia, and calling it the \\"mother crystal\\". Numerous worlds exist within the multiverse of the Nexus which are referred to as \\"realms\\". While many of these worlds are nexus- generated, some are mirrored versions of those found within Blizzard's franchises, but they can contain alternate universe versions of various heroes, indicated by hero skins in the game. Music Heroes of the Storm playlist combines original soundtrack with soundtracks from other Blizzard franchises. Original soundtrack was composed by Blizzard Entertainment's composers, Glenn Stafford, and Jason Hayes. Other music in the game is present as background music, or represents universe from which hero, event or battleground came. Playlist includes soundtracks from Starcraft, such as Terran and Zerg Theme; various soundtracks from World of Warcraft, such as Obsidian Sanctum from Wrath of the Lich King, and The Wandering Isle from Mists of Pandaria; soundtracks from Diablo, such as Jungle from Diablo II (Act III), and Reaper of Souls from Diablo III; as well as soundtracks from Overwatch such as Overture and Hanamura theme; and Smugglers Cove from The Lost Vikings 2. The Battle Begins by Glenn Stafford is the name of the Heroes of the Storm main theme. Reception Heroes of the Storm received generally favorable reviews upon release. Metacritic calculated an average score of 86 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\", based on 57 reviews. GameSpot awarded it 9 out of 10, summarizing \\"A fantastic casual-competitive game that offers untold hours of enjoyment.\\" Positive reviews praised its objective-based gameplay and greater accessibility than its competitors, with Destructoid's Chris Carter giving it a 9.5 out of 10 and calling it \\"A hallmark of excellence.\\" In a review for PC Gamer, Chris Thursten focused on the game's accessibility, giving it a score of 84 out of 100 and concluding \\"The most any studio has done to open up a complex genre to a new audience. Inviting, entertaining, and deceptively deep.\\" The Escapist's CJ Miozzi stated that while its improved accessibility would make it interesting to players normally not interested in the genre, it could be less attractive to experienced players. Giving it 4 out of 5 stars, he summarized that \\"At the very least, it's a game that all gamers should try.\\" Polygon's Arthur Gies approved of the title's accessibility but expressed worry that \\"sometimes something [felt] lost along the way,\\" scoring it at 7.5 out of 10. On release, IGN's Mitch Dyer gave the game a mixed review and concluded, \\"Heroes of the Storm is a flawed, varied MOBA with terrific team fighting and poor objectives,\\" awarding it a 6.5 out of 10.https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/02/heroes-of-the-storm-review This review prompted an initially negative reaction from the game's community that turned the score into an internet meme, eventually being recognized by Blizzard themselves in a humorous promotional video for an update to the game.https://www.pcgamesn.com/heroes-of-the-storm/blizzard-havent-forgotten- igns-6510-heroes-of-the-storm-review IGN's re-review by Ian Nowakowski awarded it 8 out of 10 in March 2018, saying the game \\"packs a ton of variety and excellent characters. Some of this MOBA's modes work better than others, but it's a safe bet that it'll deliver a fun match.\\" The game was nominated for \\"Choice Video Game\\" at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards.

Sameh Fahmi holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, which he received from Cairo University in June 1973. Career and activities After graduation, Fahmi began to work at the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). In May 1993, he became a board member and vice head of the EGPC in charge of planning and projects. In January 1997, he was appointed CEO and vice chairman of the Midor oil refining venture near Alexandria. In 1997, he began to serve as a board member of the Petroleum and Mining Chamber and of the Federation of Egyptian Industries. In August 1998, he was named a board member of the Alexandria Company for Petroleum Maintenance. He joined the National Democratic Party and became a member of its policy secretariat. Fahmi was appointed oil minister to the cabinet led by the then prime minister Atef Ebeid on 5 October 1999, replacing Hamdi Al Banbi. Fahmi was also named the chairman of the Egyptian Gas Holding Company. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Egyptian holding company for petrochemicals (ECHEM) in 2002.

His term ended on 21 February 2011 and he was replaced by Mahmoud Latif Amer as oil minister. =Controversy= After leaving office, Fahmi was investigated because of alleged wrongdoing. In April 2011, it was announced by the public prosecutor that he would be tried in relation to the charges related to a natural gas deal with Israel. He was arrested and held in custody on 21 April 2011. Fahmi was sentenced to 15 years in prison in June 2012 due to his alleged role in selling and exporting natural gas to Israel in 2005 at lower prices than market rates. He along with other officials was also fined about $2.3 billion. In mid-March 2013, the court of cassation decided that Fahmi should be retried over the Egypt-Israel gas case. On 28 March 2013, he was released from prison since he stayed in prison longer than the maximum 18 months allowed for pre- trial detention. Specifically, he was jailed for 23 months.

The team's manager and first baseman was George \\"Rube\\" Deneau. Their shortstop, Raymond \\"Scotty\\" Cameron, was described as the \\"fastest man in the league\\", and was compared with Joe Tinker; he hit .341 and stole 48 bases. At the end of the season, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1912, the league was expanded from six teams to eight and was reclassified as Class C.

Making of Gus Holwerda came to know Lawrence Krauss via Christopher Hitchens and first met him at an Origins Symposium.

It was founded in 1982 by Fred H. Berger, a photographer from New York City. Berger's photography was featured prominently in the magazine. Propaganda focused on all aspects of the goth culture, including fashion, sexuality, music, art and literature. Propaganda was, at the time of its final issue in 2002, the longest running and most popular gothic subculture magazine in the United States. History Photographer and journalist Fred H. Berger was inspired to create Propaganda based on his interest in the gothic, industrial, darkwave, occult and fetish subcultures. Berger's official title was not editor-in-chief, but \\"Propaganda Minister\\". Between 1991 and 1995 Propaganda produced three videos, The Trilogy, Blood Countess, and The Ritual. Blood Countess is about Elizabeth Bathory. The magazine featured interviews and coverage of music acts such as Bauhaus, Xmal Deutschland, Laibach, Skinny Puppy, Fields of the Nephilim, Sisters of Mercy, Diamanda Galas, Jesus & Mary Chain, Siouxsie And The Banshees, Coil, Christian Death, Alien Sex Fiend, Swans, Legendary Pink Dots, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, Shadow Project, Xymox, Death in June, Dead Can Dance, Front Line Assembly, The Cure, Danzig and Love & Rockets. Other subjects included articles about the Salem Witch Trials, the Holy Lance, Nazi- fetish chic, the Masque of the Red Death, Oscar Wilde, the Haunted Summer with Lord Byron and Mary Shelley, and queer chic authors Jean Genet and Yukio Mishima. Interviews with favorite goth authors Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite were also featured, as well as travel pieces such as \\"Old Haunts In New Orleans.\\" Berger wrote most of the esoteric, historical and literary articles during the magazine's run. Music editors Paul Hart & Stephanie Young handled most of the music related aspects of the magazine from 1985 to 2002, interviewing bands and artists. Senior Editor George Petros wrote musical and artist features such as Genitorturers and H.R. Giger as well as news content for the Propaganda website from 2000 to 2005.Propaganda Magazine No. 27, Fall 2002, pp. 3.George Petros, Wikipedia article (The Propaganda website closed three years after the print magazine's termination.) Photography Berger's photography was a large focus for the magazine. Androgynous male models were commonly used. Propaganda Issue No. 25 (Winter 1999) featured a heroin chic cover story called \\"Anarchy in Moscow\\" with photo essay by Berger. It was about a junkie hustler in Moscow during the social collapse of Russia after the fall of communism, and it generated more international interest than any article ever featured in Propaganda. Legacy Dark fantasy and horror writer Nancy Kilpatrick called Propaganda \\"probably the only subculture publication known to just about every goth on the planet,\\" in her 2004 book The Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined.Nancy Kilpatrick.

The regiment left the State May 18, 1861; served at and near Washington, D.

The regiment was quartered near the United States Capitol until July 3, 1861, when it crossed into Virginia and engaged at Bull Run, with a loss of 60 in killed, wounded and missing. After passing the winter in the defenses of Washington, it moved to the Peninsula with the general advance under McClellan in March, 1862. It participated in the siege of Yorktown; the battle of Fair Oaks; the Seven Days' fighting; was next active in the Maryland campaign and suffered severe losses at Antietam in the advance of Sedgwick's division, upon the Dunker Church. Out of 339 men engaged, 128 were reported killed, wounded or missing. The regiment arrived at Falmouth, Virginia, late in November; participated in the battle of Fredericksburg; returned to its camp at Falmouth; was active at Chancellorsville in May, 1863; after a short rest at Falmouth marched to Gettysburg and there suffered fearful loss, 192 members out of 365 engaged, Col. Huston being numbered among the dead. It next participated in the engagements of the 2nd corps at Auburn and Bristoe Station in the autumn and in the Mine Run campaign, and went into winter quarters at Brandy Station, Virginia (during this time, a soldier or soldiers of the regiment completed a drawing entitled \\"How are you Fort Sumter‚Äù at the Graffiti House). Camp was broken for the Wilderness campaign late in April, 1864, and the regiment was in action constantly until after the first assault on Petersburg, where it lost 1 man killed, 9 wounded and 111 missing. On June 25, 1864, the term of service expired and the original members not reenlisted were mustered out, the remainder of the regiment being consolidated into a battalion of five companies.

The system uses independently driven vehicles traveling on a monorail track network, consisting of straight track elements, bends, curves and transfer-units for changing of travel direction. Vehicles in an ETV system transport payloads up to 50 kg both vertical and horizontal in buildings and manufacturing plants. ETV systems were primarily put on the market in the sixties by German company Telelift. Later additional companies like Siemens or Thyssen engaged in this business. Initially, electric track vehicle systems were designed for documents transport and mail distribution in office buildings and headquarters. Later, further applications were designed for hospitals, libraries, printing plants, retail stores and material handling in manufacturing plants. Mainly transported goods are: * Hospital: blood plasma, lab samples, pharmaceuticals, sterile utilities, patient records, x-rays and hospital consumables * Library: books, newspapers, journals, media * Headquarters, ministries, office buildings: documents, mail, parcels * Printing plants: printing plates * Retail stores: garment, shoes, jewelry, luxury goods * Manufacturing plants: component parts, assemblies, tools Electric track vehicle systems operate horizontal and vertical in one and the same vehicle per transport job. Conveying without transfer allows gentle transport of sensitive goods. Vehicle destination is usually typed into a touchscreen terminal at the station. The vehicles operate with a speed up to 1 m/s. The modular design of Electric Track Vehicle systems allows widespreading track networks. E.g., the ETV system in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris consists of 6.6 km tracks, 151 stations and 300 vehicles.

By 1916 he controlled 30 theatres, and was heralded as the largest individual theatre owner in the world at that time, establishing himself throughout the Northeastern United States. Starting with a career in wax sculpting, he quickly moved on to dime museums, curios, variety shows, and ultimately vaudeville theatres and movie palaces. Photograph of S.Z. Poli  Early years  Born in the village of Piano di Coreglia, a suburb of Lucca, Tuscany, Italy on New Year's Eve, 1858,King, Donald C..From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine, 1979, pg.11 his father was a church organist, and his mother made cakes and candies to sell. He began to show a talent for sketching and modeling at a young age, which his mother encouraged. During the Franco-Prussian War, the Poli's gave refuge to the family of noted French sculptor, and intimate friend of Napoleon, M. Dublex. Sylvester left his home at the young age of 13 to accompany Dublex back to Paris, where he would take on an apprenticeship to learn the art of modeling in clay and wax.King, Donald C..From Wax to Riches Marquee Magazine, NYC 1979 He returned to Italy for 32 months to complete his military obligation,King,Donald C. S.Z. Poli From Wax to Riches. Marquee Magazine. NYC, 1979 pg.11 then went back to France to resume his studies and accept employment with the Musee Grevin in Paris. He worked with the gallery's historical wax collection becoming skilled at modeling from sketches and photographs. He modeled kings, queens, presidents, and also constructed groups like the Chambor of Horrors, \\"Fulton's Invention of the Steamboat\\", and Life of Christ.  Moving to America  After several years of service with the Musee Grevin in Paris, Poli went to America in September 1881, and was employed by the Eden Musee in New York. He met his lifelong partner and wife, Rosa Leverone, there. They were married on August 25, 1885.King, Donald C..From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine,1979 pg.11 In 1886, Poli went to work for the Egyptian Museum in Philadelphia as chief modeler. While seven anarchists were under sentence of death for participation in the Haymarket Riots in Chicago, Poli secured permission from the authorities, and families of the prisoners, to reproduce them in wax using their real clothes. He opened a store show with these figures, and then took to the road giving exhibitions in various cities. In 1888, he made the decision to open a permanent museum.King, Donald C..From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine, 1979, pg.12  Building an empire  In 1888, Poli formed a partnership and opened a combination of museums and theatres in Toronto, Canada, Rochester NY, and Staten Island. Eventually, he went solo in Troy, New York. In 1892, he settled in New Haven, Connecticut, and opened the Poli Eden Musee. Deciding he needed a bona fide theatre where he could stage continuous \\"high class vaudeville\\" shows, he built Poli's Wonderland Theatre in 1893. From 1897 until 1926, Poli continued to build theatres, in Waterbury, Bridgeport, Meriden and Hartford Connecticut, in Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, in Jersey City, NJ, in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, PA, and Washington, DC. The growing success of his business seemed to parallel the industrial expansion in Northeastern cities. Some cities had as many as three theatres, and Poli would often rebuild the same theatre two to three times, to stay competitive. Poli went through a period without rivals until B.F. Keith gained a powerful circuit. Wherever one began to advertise, the other would soon follow suit. After much wasted energy, the two agreed to stay out of each other's way.Rogers,Will. The Papers of Will Rogers: From Vaudeville to Broadway, September 1908-August 1915. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001. Pg 305 Poli sold all properties pertaining to the Keith feud except Jersey City.  Family  Sylvester Poli married Rosa Leverone (1/17/1869-1/5/1960) from Genoa, Italy in 1885. He taught her the meticulous art of needling into the wax figures hairs for the head and beard. In later years, while Sylvester was busy with his theatres, Rosa supported important community and philanthropic causes. She was a prominent figure with the Veterans of Foreign War, and also received the Italian Cross of Honor from Queen Elena of Italy. They had five children together; Edward (10/12/1891-11/11/1922), Adelina (7/19/1889-11/13/1966), Juliette (6/21/1897-4/1/1976), Laurina (10/1/1899-1/26/1978), and Lillian (4/3/1903-12/16/1976). Poli built the Villa Rosa Terrace(named after his wife) in Woodmont, Milford, Connecticut consisting of the main house, and ten (10) waterfront cottages, which he gave to their children. The family would spend summers together at the Villa Rosa enjoying lavish parties. He also purchased winter homes for each of the girls, with the exception of Lillian (Lily), who would go on to marry Marquis Lippi Gerini, and move back to Italy with her new husband. Poli spent much time preparing their son, Edward, to take over the business in 1923. However, in November 1922, the son contracted appendicitis and although the surgery was performed successfully, an embolism occurred and Edward died on 11 November. Overwhelmed with grief, Poli had a marble mausoleum erected in their son's memory in St. Lawrence Cemetery, West Haven, CT.  Retirement  When Poli retired at the age of 70, he had amassed over 20 theatres, three hotels (including the Savoy in Miami), 500 offices and two building sites.King, Donald, From Wax to Riches, pg.16 In July 1928, Poli sold to Fox New England Theatres, retaining 3/4 interest and creating Fox-Poli's. With the stock market crash of 1929, Fox went into receivership in 1932.King,Donald C..S.Z.Poli From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine. NYC,1979 pg 17 Poli regained control and in May 1934, Loew's Theatres purchased the remaining theatres, which became known as Loew's-Poli New England Theatres. Sylvester Poli spent his final years at his summer home, the Villa Rosa in Woodmont, CT. He died on May 31, 1937 at the age of 78 due to pneumonia.King, Donald C..From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine, 1979, pg.17  Anecdotes  George M. Cohan - Poli was bargaining with the Four Cohans for a return engagement. Young George M. Cohan felt that their act was worth more than S.Z. felt his theatre could pay. After much haggling, the Cohans agreed to go on for the old salary. During that performance, Cohan's parents were in the audience celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary. The house lights were raised and ushers came down the aisle carrying an elaborate silver serving set. The service was presented to the elder Cohans, with congratulations from the Poli's. After the show, S.Z. and Rosa gave a reception for them. George asked S.Z. why he had made such a fuss over their salary, as the anniversary gift and party cost far more than the increase he had wanted. S.Z. replied, \\"George, the salary was business, the gift is friendship.\\"King,Donald C..S.Z.Poli From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine.NYC,1979. Pg.17 Al Jolson first appeared for Poli in New Haven, CT as part of a trio, \\"Jolson, Palmer and Jolson\\". S.Z. suggested that Jolson might do better as a single act in blackface. Jolson went out on his own to stardom.King, Donald C..From Wax to Riches, Marquee Magazine, 1979, pg.13  Quotes  Sylvester Z. Poli a.k.a. The Grand Old Monarch About being born at 10:00PM on New Year's Eve: \\"I was a year old, two hours after I was born.\\"New Haven County periodical circa 1928 Family Archives About his shows: \\"Always, and at all times, I have been a strong believer in morality. I have insisted always on clean shows, and have never tolerated anything that could be fairly regarded as unfit for public presentation.\\" Some of the reasons for his remarkable success: \\"And like the shoemaker, who sticks to his task, I have never run to strange channels; I have remained always a showman. My attention, my resources, my investments, my capacities have been kept always in the theatrical groove. I have sought neither diversion nor profit outside the theatrical field. Possibly to that fact of concentration I owe, as much as to anything, what success has come to me in the theatrical profession. From the New Haven Civic Improvement Committee representing the Italian-American voice: \\"Our race has found a sure refuge behind the Stars and Stripes, and we feel that among all her sons who are striving to carry this banner to victory, none will bring enthusiasm and more steadfast loyalty than her sons of Italian blood.\\"Sterba,Christopher M..Good Americans:Italian and Jewish Immigrants During the First World War.

Events  On 19 February 2013, heavy fighting occurred as French Special Forces pushed deeper into the Azawad hinterland in pursuit of Islamist insurgents. During the engagement one paratrooper from the French Foreign Legion and 20 Islamists were killed.

It is a small image, 6 x 3 1/2 inches, painted in egg tempera on a panel of wood. It is in the Uffizi gallery, Florence. The painting shows the mythical giant Antaeus, son of Gaia, goddess of the Earth, being crushed to death in the arms of Heracles. Hercules was a Florentine hero, regarded as an image of the Florentine state ‚Äì its ruthless and warlike spirit ‚Äì which furthered its political and economic success.

It covers an area of , but with depths between 9 and only 45 meters.NGA Bathymetric Chart 91005 graphically illustrates unambiguously how the areas surrounding the Bank quickly descend from depths less than 100m to depths more than 1,000m in distances of less than 20km. The submerged but hydrocarbon-rich area includes Nares Bank and Marie Louise Bank. Although the Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled in 2016 that the area is within the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone, economic rights to the area continue to be disputed - mainly by the People's Republic of China - and exploitation of the hydrocarbon reserves by the Philippines have been suspended for some years. The bank is in the northeast quadrant of the Philippine's Kalayaan claimed territory, which also includes most of the north and east portions of the Spratly Islands. The area is located off the west coast of Palawan, north of Iroquis reef and the Southern reefs, and east of the northern part of the Spratly Islands. The nearest occupied parts of the Spratly Islands are Philippine-occupied Flat Island, Nanshan Island and Second Thomas Shoal, and the PRC-occupied Mischief Reef.  History  Subsequent to the Chinese occupation of Mischief Reef in the mid-1990s, a Philippine World War II-vintage naval landing craft, (LST 57 - Sierra Madre), was deliberately run aground on the Second Thomas Shoal in 1999 to maintain a Philippine naval outpost in the area; more than 15 years later it continues to be manned by about a dozen Philippine marines. In June 2019 a Filipino fishing vessel was hit and sunk by a Chinese fishing vessel. The Armed Forces of the Philippines stated that they believed it to be a deliberate attack given the nature of the incident, the wood hulled Filipino vessel Gimver 1 was sitting at anchor when hit and the steel hulled Chinese vessel which hit it failed to stop and offer assistance after the incident. The 22 crew members had to be rescued off of the sinking vessel by a nearby Vietnamese fishing vessel which responded to their distress calls.  Oil, gas and SC72  Seismic surveys indicate that the Reed Bank is rich in oil and gas deposits, but they have only been partly tapped due to disputed claims from various countries, most particularly the PRC. Exploration in the area began in 1970, and in 1976 gas was discovered in the Sampaguita structure following the drilling of a well. In total, three wells have been drilled to date, all located at the south west end of the Sampaguita structure. The initial 2-year concession by the Philippines' Government to extract the resources, (SC72, formerly GSEC101,) was awarded to Sterling Energy PLC in June 2002. In April 2005, Forum Energy PLC (FEP) acquired the concession from Sterling and became its operator. Forum Energy PLC (FEP) is a London-based listed oil and gas exploration firm focused on the Philippines; it is 64.45% owned by Philex Petroleum Corporation. In February 2010, the licence was converted to a Service Contract, and FEP performed geological and geophysical works and seismic surveys. In July 2011 the Philippines' Department of Energy (DOE) approved the commencement of a 2-year phase of the project leading to the drilling of 2 wells, and preparations commenced. However, the PRC Government had also granted exploration rights to the area to the PRC State-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). The PRC objected to the Philippine arrangement. The requisite approvals from the Philippine DOE to commence drilling were not issued, and the project was placed on hold. In May 2012, the then Philex chairman and CEO, \\"MVP\\" (Manuel V. Pangilinan), made an offer to CNOOC, which CNOOC turned down. There have been further meetings between Philex and CNOOC, but the project remains on hold.

Sierra Club v. Babbitt, 15 F. Supp. 2d 1274 (S.D. Ala. 1998), is a United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama case in which the Sierra Club and several other environmental organizations and private citizens challenged the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Plaintiffs filed action seeking declaratory injunctive relief regarding two incidental take permits (ITPs) issued by the FWS for the construction of two isolated high-density housing complexes in habitat of the endangered Alabama beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus ammobates). The District Court ruled that the FWS must reconsider its decision to allow high-density development on the Alabama coastline that might harm the endangered Alabama beach mouse. The District Court found that the FWS violated both the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by permitting construction on the dwindling beach mouse habitat. Background information=Endangered Species Act= The ESA of 1973 was signed by President Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973, and provides for the conservation of species that are endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of their range, and the conservation of the ecosystems on which they depend. Under the ESA, species are defined as subspecies, varieties, and (for vertebrates) distinct population segments. The ESA protects endangered and threatened species and their habitats by prohibiting the \\"take\\" of listed animals and the interstate or international trade in listed plants and animals, including their parts and products, except under federal permit. Section 9(a)(1) of the ESA sets out the general prohibition on taking listed species. Take is defined as, \\"to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct.\\" =Habitat Conservation Plans= In 1982, Congress amended the ESA to allow limited take of listed threatened and endangered species to lawful development projects. This amendment requires the issuance of an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) by either the Secretary of Interior or the Secretary of Commerce. To mitigate possible take of listed species, Section 10(a) of the ESA requires that the parties obtaining an ITP must submit a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). A HCP is a required part of an application for an ITP, a permit issued under the ESA to private entities including private citizens, corporations, Tribes, States, and counties with undertaking projects that might result in the destruction of an endangered or threatened species.Habitat Conservation Plan The HCP lays out the proposed actions, determining the effects of those actions on affected wildlife species and their habitats, and defining measures to minimize and mitigate adverse effects. The FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) oversee the HCP program. =National Environmental Policy Act= In 1969, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was one of the first laws ever written that established a broad national framework for protecting the environment. NEPA's basic policy is to assure that all branches of government give proper consideration to the environment, prior to undertaking of any major federal action that could significantly affect the environment. A project is federally controlled when it requires federal licensing, federal funding, or is undertaken by the federal government. When such a project is determined to have significant effects on the human environment, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required. An EIS for a proposed project outlines in detail the proposed actions, alternative actions (including no action), and their probable environmental ramifications. The environmental impact statements must cover plausible bases, which are generally determined by the rule of reason. Major parties=Sierra Club= The Sierra Club was the major petitioner in this case. It was founded in 1892 by John Muir in San Francisco, California, and is one of America's oldest, largest, and most influential grassroots environmental organizations. The Sierra Club's mission is to explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; to practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; to educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out those objectives. =Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)= The FWS was the major respondent of this case. It is a federal government agency within the United States Department of the Interior dedicated to the management of fish, wildlife, and natural habitats. The mission of the agency is \\"working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.\\"United States Fish and Wildlife Service Under the ESA, FWS is responsible for protecting endangered and threatened species and their habitats. Under provisions of section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, a federal agency that carries out, permits, licenses, funds, or otherwise authorizes activities that may affect a listed species, must consult with the FWS to ensure that its actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. Bruce Babbitt served as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1993 to 2001. As the Secretary of the Interior, Secretary Babbitt was responsible for overseeing several government agencies, which included the FWS. Facts The Alabama beach mouse, a sand-colored mouse indigenous to the beaches and sandy fields of southern Alabama, was listed as endangered in 1985 due to the drastic destruction of the species' habitat by residential and commercial development, recreational activity and tropical storms. At the time of listing, 671 acres of beach mouse habitat remained on the Fort Morgan Peninsula on the Alabama coast. The FWS speculated that the remaining habitat may not be an adequate area to allow the beach mouse population to recover. Since then, the habitat has been further reduced by commercial and residential development, a golf course, and a series of hurricanes. Nevertheless, the FWS permitted two isolated high density housing complexes within the beach mouse habitat including the Aronov project and the Fort Morgan project, which was brought to suit in this case. The ESA does not offer much exception for developers that find an endangered species on the land they wish to develop. In order to get permits, the developers must prepare a HCP, which shows the impact on the species, and ways to mitigate that impact. The FWS approved the developer's plans and issued permits for two Fort Morgan developments. They claimed that the permits \\"will not jeopardize the beach mouse\\" or harm its critical habitat. However, the FWS did remain concerned over whether the mitigation in the permit plans was to the maximum extent practicable, as required by the ESA. Arguments The Sierra Club challenged the issuance of these permits under the ESA and the NEPA, asking the District Court to suspend the permits, based on the HCP, and until the FWS revised its environmental analysis and permit conditions. The plaintiffs brought three claims: 1) the level of off- site mitigation funding was inadequate and lacked any rational basis; 2) the FWS's offsite mitigation policy was inconsistent; and 3) the FWS's reliance on unnamed sources to pay the additional costs for providing adequate off-site mitigation was arbitrary and capricious. First, the Sierra Club claimed that the mitigation part of the HCP was not sufficient under the ESA. In response, the FWS stated that its concerns were met when the applicant added mitigation measures. However, the FWS's own field offices had concerns over the impacts of the planned development on the Alabama beach mouse. The regional office stated that the effects of the Fort Morgan project were the largest of any beach mouse HCP to date, but provided the least mitigation. In court, the FWS claimed that mitigation concerns were addressed before the Biological Opinion and that they were going to require additional funds for offsite mitigation. The plaintiffs held that the FWS decision was not rational. Second, the Sierra Club claimed that the FWS failed to develop standards to determine the appropriate amount of mitigation necessary for the survival of the beach mouse. The FWS decision to grant permits was inconsistent with their own Habitat Conservation Planning Handbook. According to the Handbook, mitigation measures should be as consistent as possible for all HCPs with similarly situated species. The Handbook states that \\"the Service should not apply inconsistent mitigation policies for the same species, unless differences are based on biological or other good reasons and are clearly explained. The court examined mitigation requirements for other projects within the beach mouse habitat and found no consistency. The court did not find that the FWS followed their own guidelines. What the court did find, however, was that the FWS, had no justification for the issuance of the permits. Third, the Sierra Club also challenged the plan because the sources which were intended to fund the offsite mitigation efforts, remained unnamed. The FWS mentioned that additional funds were needed for mitigation efforts, but they did not include where the funding would come from. The Biological Opinion required additional funds from nonprofit organizations in order to fully mitigate the projects, but never stated how much, from whom, or the likelihood the funds would ever be acquired. The court agreed and cited the FWS's own documentation, which stated that the \\"Applicant's offsite mitigation funding would have to be combined with additional funds from a non-profit organization in order to purchase a large tract or several tracts for mitigation purposes.\\" Without a given source of funding or specific amount to be spent, the court could find no rational basis for issuance of the permits. Analysis under National Environmental Policy Act FWS failed to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) as required by the NEPA. The NEPA requires that federal agencies like the FWS consider the environmental consequences of proposed actions to ensure fully informed and well-considered decisions. A project that may adversely affect an endangered species or its critical habitat is considered to significantly affect the environment, requiring an EIS. Rather than prepare an EIS, the FWS issued a \\"finding of no significant impact\\" for the Fort Morgan developments, concluding its analysis of possible impacts on the Alabama beach mouse. There are four criteria to be considered in determining whether an agency's decision not to prepare an EIS is arbitrary and capricious: First, the agency must have accurately identified the relevant environmental concern. Second, once the agency has identified the problem it must have taken a \\"hard look\\" at the problem in preparing the Environmental Assessment (EA). Third, if a finding of no significant impact is made, the agency must be able to make a convincing case for its finding. Last, if the agency does find an impact of true significance, preparation of an EIS can be avoided only if the agency finds that changes or safeguards in the project sufficiently reduce the impact to a minimum. After a careful review of the Administrative Record, the Court was persuaded that many of the important \\"facts\\" on which the FWS based its decision appear to be assumptions, presumptions, or conclusions themselves ‚Äî not facts based on any evidence, documents, or data in the Administrative Record. Opinion of court The plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction was granted, and the defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment was denied. The District Court remanded the decision to issue the permits to the FWS. It directed the FWS to gather the necessary data and conduct the required scientific analysis in order to determine whether the permits issued meet requirements under the ESA and the NEPA. The court stressed that the FWS must do more than merely go through the motions in performing its duties to protect the Alabama beach mouse from extinction. The court agreed with the Sierra Club and found that the FWS ignored its initial concerns, failing to determine if the proposed amount of mitigation funding could provide adequate mitigation. The court noted the complete lack of consideration or explanation of the amount of mitigation funding in the plan or permits. Without analysis or consideration, the court concluded that the FWS cannot support its decision that the amount of mitigation funding was adequate and found the issuance of permits arbitrary and capricious. Additionally, the court held that the FWS's reliance on unnamed sources for offsite mitigation was contrary to the law and unsupported by any factually reliable basis in the Administrative Record. Significance and subsequent developments Although environmental groups have challenged a number of incidental take permits in court, judges typically defer to the expert judgment of the FWS. Sierra Club v. Babbitt was one of the few cases where the plaintiffs won. The Chevron deference rule (see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.), in which the Supreme Court holds that courts should defer to agency interpretations of such statutes unless they are unreasonable, was used in this case. The environmental statutes were clear and unambiguous. However, the FWS interpretation of the laws were not reasonable. This sets the stage for regulatory federal agencies being held accountable for noncompliance of environmental statutes and irrational decision making.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 568 U.S. 78 (2013), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica Baykeeper challenged the Los Angeles County Flood Control District (District) for violating the terms of its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit as shown in water quality measurements from monitoring stations within the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers.. The Supreme Court, by a unanimous 9-0 vote, reversed and remanded the Ninth Circuit's ruling on the grounds that the flow of water from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the same waterway does not qualify as a \\"discharge of a pollutant\\" under the Clean Water Act. Parties=Los Angeles County Flood Control District= The Los Angeles County Flood Control District is the petitioner in this particular case. The district was established upon adoption of the Los Angeles County Flood Control Act in 1915, after a disastrous regional flood occurred. The district's primary purpose is to provide flood protection, water conservation, recreation, and aesthetic enhancement within its boundaries. As of 1985, the responsibilities and authority of the district were transferred to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. The Flood Control District encompasses more than 3,000 square miles and 85 cities in Southern California. It includes approximately 500 miles of open channel, 2,800 miles of underground storm drainage pipelines, and an estimated 120,000 catch basins. =Natural Resources Defense Council= The Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica Baykeeper are the respondent. The Natural Resources Defense Council is a nationwide environmental action group consisting of over 1.3 million members and over 350 lawyers, scientists and other professionals. Santa Monica Baykeeper is a non-profit organization that aims to protect and restore the Santa Monica Bay, San Pedro Bay and adjacent waters through enforcement, field work, and community action.  Background  The district operates a \\"municipal separate storm sewer system\\" (MS4), which is a conveyance or a system of conveyances that collects and transports stormwater runoff into waters of the U.S. The district's MS4 transports stormwater through rivers and channels flowing to the Pacific Ocean. Because stormwater is often heavily polluted from various non-point sources, the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations require certain MS4s to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit before discharging stormwater into navigable waters. Between 2002 and 2008, monitoring stations in the Los Angeles River, San Gabriel River, Santa Clara River, and Malibu Creek continually detected water pollution levels that exceeded its MS4 permit in its stormwater channel system. Some of the pollution levels exceeded included high levels of aluminum, copper, cyanide, fecal coliform bacteria, and zinc. Prior cases=District court opinion= In 2008, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica Baykeeper (collectively NRDC) filed a citizen-enforcement action against the district and county in the Central District of California, and alleged that the district violated the NPDES permit and the Clean Water Act. NRDC sought to impose liability on the district for its permit violations in four rivers: the Los Angeles River, San Gabriel River, Santa Clara River, and Malibu Creek. The district argued that this issue was resolved by the court's earlier decision in the South Florida Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe (541 U.S. 95) case, which determined that transferring water within a single water body does not constitute a \\"discharge.\\" The district court initially denied summary judgment because the evidence did not clearly show whether the standards-exceeding pollutant had been discharged through the district's MS4. Thus, the district court concluded that NRDC failed to show whether there had been a \\"discharge\\" from a \\"point source\\" within the statutory meanings of those terms. The district court granted summary judgment to the district on these claims and concluded that the record was insufficient to warrant a finding that the MS4 had discharged stormwater containing the pollutants detected at the downstream monitoring stations. South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians Southern third of the Florida Peninsula, showing the area managed by the South Florida Water Management District In this 2004 U.S. Supreme Court case, the Miccosukee Tribe challenged the South Florida Water Management District on an issue related to the operation of a new pump station that transferred water from a concrete canal to a large undeveloped wetland area as part of the Central and South Florida Flood Control Project. During rain events, stormwater collected in the canal contained contaminants such as phosphorus and fertilizers from agricultural and urban land uses. The district impounded water in the wetland area, a remnant of the original South Florida Everglades, to conserve fresh water that might otherwise flow directly to the ocean and to preserve wetland habitat. When water levels in the canal rose above a set level, the pump would transfer water out of the canal and empty the water in the canal. In doing so, the phosphorus-containing the water altered the wetland's ecosystem, which was naturally low in phosphorus, and stimulated the growth of algae and plants that were uncommon in the Everglades ecosystem. The Miccosukee Tribe filed suit under the Clean Water Act, which prohibits \\"the discharge of any pollutant by any person\\" unless done in compliance with the Act. The Tribe claimed that the pump station required an NPDES permit, because it moved phosphorus-laden water from the canal into the wetland area, but the district contended that the pump's operation did not constitute the \\"discharge of a pollutant\\" under the Act. The district court granted the Tribe summary judgment, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. For the purposes of NPDES permitting requirements, the Government (as an impartial adviser to the district) contended that all water bodies that fall within the Act's definition of \\"navigable water\\" (which are defined as \\"the waters of the U.S.\\") should be viewed collectively. Since the Act requires NPDES permits only when there is an addition of a pollutant to \\"navigable waters,\\" this approach implied that such permits are not required when water is transferred from one navigable water, unaltered, into another navigable water body. However, because neither the district nor the Government raised the \\"unitary waters\\" approach before the Eleventh Circuit or in their briefs respecting certiori and because some factual issues remained unresolved, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to resolve the unitary waters argument and the case was remanded to the lower court. =Appeals Court opinion= The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in part, finding that the NRDC was entitled to summary judgment on its claims regarding the Los Angeles River and San Gabriel River because the monitoring stations are located within the MS4 owned and operated by the district. The U.S. Court of Appeals held that the district was liable for the discharge of pollutants that occurred when the polluted stormwater detected at the monitoring stations flowed out of the concrete-lined portions of the rivers, where the monitoring stations are located, into lower, unlined portions of the same rivers. However, with regard to the Santa Clara River and Malibu Creek, NRDC failed to provide adequate evidence for the district court to determine if stormwater discharged from the MS4 caused or contributed to exceedances of permitted water quality levels. As such, the NRDC was entitled to summary judgment on the district's liability for discharges into the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers but not the Santa Clara River or Malibu Creek. {Map of the Los Angeles River Watershed Map of the San Gabriel River Watershed |} Supreme Court decision= Issues = The Clean Water Act regulates discharges of pollutants, including discharges of pollutants from municipal stormwater systems. The petition of a writ of certiorari (filed October 11, 2011) posed two questions to the Supreme Court: :1. Do \\"navigable waters of the United States\\" include only \\"naturally occurring\\" bodies of water so that construction of engineered channels or other man-made improvements to a river as part of municipal flood and storm control renders the improved portion no longer a \\"navigable water\\" under the Clean Water Act? :2. When water flows from one portion of a river that is a navigable water of the United States, through a concrete channel or other engineered improvement in the river constructed for flood and stormwater control as part of a municipal separate storm sewer system, into a lower portion of the same river, can there be a \\"discharge\\" from an \\"outfall\\" under the Clean Water Act, notwithstanding this Court's holding in South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians, 541 U.S. 95, 105 (2004), that transfer of water within a single body of water cannot constitute a \\"discharge\\" for purposes of the Act? =Granting of certiorari= The petition for a writ of certiorari sought to expand the definition of \\"navigable waters of the United States\\" to potentially include human engineered improvements, and to also reverse the verdict of the Ninth Circuit based on the Supreme Court's prior ruling in South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians. On June 25, 2012 the Supreme Court granted certiorari and limited to Question 2 set forth in the initial petition for a writ of certiorari. The Supreme Court granted the certiorari in order to address the Ninth Circuit's verdict which reversed a previous decision and held that the Los Angeles County Flood Control District was liable due to the discharge of pollutants that occurred when polluted water was detected at the monitoring stations as it flowed out through the concrete channel to unimproved portions of the river. The Supreme Court decided to limit its scope to the latter of the two questions, leaving the first to the lower courts.  Arguments  Los Angeles River Bridge The case was argued on December 4, 2012 by NRDC senior attorney Aaron Colangelo for respondents and GMSR partner Timothy T. Coates for the petitioner L.A. County. Essentially conceding that the premise upon which the Ninth Circuit's decision was based was incorrect, the NRDC and Baykeeper sought to argue that the exceedances detected at monitoring stations themselves sufficed in establishing the liability of the district under the Clean Water Act for its upstream discharges. NRDC felt that the Court of Appeals came to the correct decision, albeit for the wrong reasons, in their evaluation of the discharge of pollutants from an improved portion to an unimproved portion of the same waters. The NRDC and Baykeeper contended that the exceedances detected at the instream monitoring stations were sufficient to establish the district's liability under the Clean Water Act for upstream discharges. In addition, the NRDC argued that under the terms of the permit, the district had agreed to be severally liable with its co- permittees for any excess pollution in the river picked up by the monitoring stations. The district sought to argue that under the EPA's 2008 water transfer rule (40 C.F.R. ¬ß 122.3(i)) it was not liable for violating its permit. The NRDC, however, pointed out that the water transfer rules did not apply in the cases of MS4s stating that \\"[m]unicipal separate storm sewer systems...are clearly subject to regulation under the Act. CWA section 402(p).\\" The district argued that the issue granted certiorari by the Supreme Court had to be resolved in favor of the district on the basis of previous standing. Again, this point was not in contention on the part of the NRDC. As the first issue upon which the petition for certiorari was not going to be addressed in court, the district sought to argue the alternative monitoring argument that the NRDC was attempting to bring forth. The district argued that the monitoring theory itself was contrary to the Clean Water Act, which imposes liability only where it is shown that a permitee has discharged in violation of permit terms. The Supreme Court ruled that their grant of certiorari was only to evaluate the Court of Appeals ruling as it related to the prior standing and \\"did not address or indicate any opinion on the issue the NRDC and Baykeeper seek to substitute.\\"  Opinion of the court  The case was argued on December 4, 2012 with a decision being issued on January 8, 2013. Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court which held that the flow from an improved portion of a navigable waterway into an unimproved portion of the same waterway does not constitute a \\"discharge of a pollutant\\" under the Clean Water Act. This was based on the standing of the South Florida Water Management Dist. v. Miccosukee Tribe. Based on this, the court found that the Ninth Circuit's decision was not in accordance with this hold and reversed and remanded the decision. Significance of the case Some environmental groups expressed concern that the U.S. Supreme Court decision inappropriately relied on the Court's past decision on the South Florida Water Management District v. Miccosukee Tribe of Indians case. While the Court was asked to determine whether the transfer of water that arguably contained pollutants from one part of a water body into another part of that same water body needed a permit to discharge pollutants in the Miccosukee case, there is no doubt that municipal storm sewers need permits to discharge into rivers in the Los Angeles Flood Control District v. NRDC case. Outside parties asserted that the two situations have nothing in common. In general, several parties believe that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision is narrow in its scope, and questioned why the Supreme Court had decided to hear the case rather than just reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision. However, the reversal of the Ninth Circuit's judgment against the Los Angeles County Flood Control District in the case implies that local water quality advocates will continue to pressure the local regulator, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, to ensure that the new municipal stormwater permit effectively implements its water quality improvement measures. Additionally, while the Supreme Court decided against addressing the first question raised in the certiorari, if it had been addressed, it would have further defined \\"navigable waters\\" under the Clean Water Act. Some observers of the case contend that there are additional lessons that can be taken from the Supreme Court case. By not defending the decision made by the Ninth Circuit, the NRDC was able to steer the Court's attention to more plausible grounds in an effort to keep the case alive for a remand.

Her childhood was spent in the vicinity of Lezayre, and later Ballaragh near Laxey,'Who is Mona Douglas?' (3) 'I was brought up first in Lezayre' ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 117 (2010) where she received a very free and informal upbringing: \\"I never went to school and I used to just go round Ballaragh with the farmers and down to Laxey and went out in the boats with the fishermen, and wandering about pretty well as I liked.\\"'Who is Mona Douglas?' (6) 'Beginnings (2)' ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 120 (2010) Music was a central part of Douglas' upbringing, most notably through the musical evenings which took place at her parents' house when she visited them. Both of her parents were musical: her father played the violin and flute, and her mother played the piano and sang; and they were both members of a choral society.'Who is Mona Douglas?' (5) 'Beginnings' ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 119 (2010) On Sunday evenings, from when Douglas was six years old, a number of other cultured people from the community would gather at their house \\"for poetry readings, discussion and music\\". Through this she gained a knowledge of \\"the great English and American poets\\" and the music of Handel, Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Chopin, Puccini and Verdi. Some Manx music also featured: > \\"We knew little of folksong, but the Manx National Songs were often sung and > played, and it was about this time, I think, that I first became conscious > of my Manx nationality, and felt the first stirrings of that passionate love > for the Island and all things Manx which has been with me ever since.\\" Douglas received a copy of Grimms' Fairy Tales aged four, obtained a public library ticket aged five and received her first collection of poetry aged seven (Robert Louis Stevenson's A Child's Garden of Verses). She took up writing poetry at this age, commenting later that \\"soon I began to spend my pennies on pencils and exercise-books instead of sweets and ice-cream.\\" During the holiday periods, Douglas would visit her aunt and uncle in Douglas. At the age of nine her visit coincided with the Eisteddfod of 1908, and she submitted her poem, Douglas Bay, into the competition. When it won first prize, she came to the attention of Sophia Morrison, W. Walter Gill and William Cubbon, whom she later described as \\"the strongest influences in determining the trend of my subsequent literary work. [...] I have no adequate words to express my grateful consciousness of the help and guidance given to me in my formative years by these three good friends.\\" Sophia Morrison was responsible for setting Douglas on the task of collecting folklore, song, music and dance: > \\"[...] when she found the kind of life I was living she started me > collecting, putting things down. She didn't call it collecting then. She > said, 'You know, you ought to write down some of these things that people > tell you and sing to you.' And she gave me a little notebook in which I > started to write things down and I still have.\\" Douglas also began to publish her poetry at this time, submitting poems to and often winning competitions in publications such as The Girl's Realm, Lady's Pictorial, The Lady and The Gentlewoman. Her poetry took a stylistic shift in 1908 when she discovered the writing of W. B. Yeats, who would influence her writing for the rest of her life. Youth By May 1915 Douglas had moved back to her parents in Birkenhead.Listing as a donor in 'T.E. Brown Memorial' in Mannin No. 5, May 1915 From here she studied at the Liverpool School of Art for two years whilst at the same time taking private lessons in violin, piano, singing and music theory from people associated with the Liverpool Philharmonic. With the start of World War I, she started work in her parents' bakery to replace a man who had gone to war. Whilst in England, at the age of sixteen, Douglas had her first collection of poetry published; Manx Song and Maiden Song, published under a London imprint of Erskine Macdonald in 1915.'Who is Mona Douglas?' ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 99 (2007) Some of this collection of 26 poems had been written when she was only fourteen. Besides the numerous poems depicting the Manx landscape and sea, one notable poem was entitled 'T. E. Brown: a memorial sonnet to the poet of Manxland.' P. W. Caine reviewed the collection, commenting that: \\"This little book of lyrics is full of beauty and charm. The sound of the sea, the scent of gorse and the silence of the mountains pervade it.\\"'Notices of Books' by P. W. Caine, in Mannin No. 7, May 1916 Her poem, 'Two Twilights', illustrates both the style of her verse and also the mystical tone that pervades it: > :Over the wild waves comes the call of the great spaces; :White breakers > leap from a plain of silver-grey‚Äî :Dreaming lies the world, but the reckless > sea still moveth, :In the mystic hour of twilight, at the dawning of the > day. In 1916 Douglas took up Manx Gaelic lessons, writing by the end of November that \\"I am still keeping up my efforts to learn [Manx] & go over to Kennish's nearly every week for a 'lesson'. It is slow work, but someday I hope to acquire a perfect mastery ‚Äì at any rate that is my aim.\\"Letter to Sophia Morrison, 29 November 1916, quoted in 'Learning Manx (1915-16)' in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, p. 98 She did become fluent in Manx, coming to teach and write poetry in it over the coming decade. Douglas' second poetry book, Mychurachan, was published in 1917. This collection of 40 poems derived its name from the Manx for driftwood or jetsam ‚Äì mooirchooraghyn. In recognition of Douglas' poetry up to this point she was invested as a Bard of the Third Degree in the Order of Gorsedds at the Royal Eisteddfod of Wales, and given the bardic name of 'Mona Manaw' (\\"Mona of Man\\"). Archibald Knox As a result of the death of Douglas' friend and mentor, Sophia Morrison, in January 1917, Douglas was elected Secretary of the leading cultural body of the Isle of Man at that time, Yn √áheshaght Ghailckagh (The Manx Language Society). Then aged only 18, the notice of Douglas' appointment stated that: \\"Miss Douglas is still very young, but the achievement of her youth is already such as to give the most glowing promise [...] Miss Douglas has leisure, she has enthusiasm, and those who are acquainted with her are confident that she has judgment.\\"'Notices' in Mannin No. 9, May 1917 In the wake of Morrison's death, Douglas also stepped in to edit the final edition of the journal Mannin, to which she contributed a poem of her own in memory of Morrison.'Ersooyl' by Mona Douglas in Mannin, No. 9, May 1917 Douglas had earlier contributed folklore notes to previous editions of the journal,'Billy the Dollan' in Mannin No. 6, November 1915; and 'Lezayre Notes' in Mannin No. 7, May 1916 including her first published piece on folklore.'Introduction to the Second Edition' by Stephen Miller in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, p. iii Through her position as Secretary of Yn √áheshaght Ghailckagh, Douglas also became the Secretary of the Manx branch of the Celtic Congress. In this capacity she attended the Celtic Congress of 1917, where she met Alfred Perceval Graves. He and others of the Pan-Celtic movement made a large and lasting impact on her: \\"my association with a number of national personalities convinced me firmly that the goal of nationalists in all the Celtic countries should be, eventually, an independent federation of the Celtic States.\\" This Pan-Celtic fervour emerged in her third collection of poetry, A Dhooragh, published in 1919. The poem placed first in that collection showed clearly Douglas' \\"open sympathy\\" for the Irish Easter Rising of 1916:'Who is Mona Douglas?' (1) Mona Douglas in praise of the Easter Uprising (1919) ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 100 (2007) > :Kinsmen of the shining west! :Your unrest wild hearts have shared: :Soon > from our land, too, shall rise, :Through wild skies, a singing bird. Douglas' avid interest in the Celtic Movement in Ireland was deepened when she visited Dublin in 1921 at the invitation of Professor Agnes O'Farrelly of University College Dublin, who she had probably met at the Celtic Congress four years earlier. Whilst staying with O'Farrelly in Rathgar, Douglas took a short course in Irish Literature; she also studied a course in librarianism, with the intention of getting a job at the Library of the Manx Museum, which was to open in 1922. However no such job materialised. Whilst in Dublin, Douglas met George Russell, who influenced and encouraged her interest in Manannan, as well as seeing W. B. Yeats whilst visiting the Abbey Theatre. Four Manx Plays was published in 1921, a collection of three plays by Douglas and one by J. J. Kneen. Douglas' plays, 'The Faery Tune', 'The Lips of the Sea' and 'Churning', were written in the Manx English dialect and were generally rural-based comic plays. Upon seeing the first of these plays in 1916, Sophia Morrison had explained to a friend that: \\"Miss Douglas' idea is to shew the inherent mysticism of the people, & the strange mingling of the old faith & the new which one finds among the older people, & those who live up among the hills ‚Äì they use Christianity vaguely as a sort of charm, while really possessing a strong belief in the old fairy powers!\\"Sophia Morrison's letter to G. W. Wood, 15 September 1916, quoted in 'The Fairy Tune (1916)' in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, p. 101 By 1924 all of the plays had all been produced \\"with great acceptance.\\"'Mona Douglas' in Isle of Man Examiner Annual 1924, Douglas: S.K. Broadbent, 1924 Life in the UK In 1925 Douglas moved to Harlech, Wales, to work as secretary to the poet Alfred Perceval Graves (the father of Robert Graves), while he wrote his autobiography, To Return to All That. Graves then encouraged Douglas to go to London to broaden her horizons.'(Constance) Mona Douglas' on The Douglas Archives (accessed 20 November 2013) In London Douglas worked for around three years as a freelance journalist and even for a time for a producer at the Elstree Film Studios. While in London, Douglas continued to strengthen her ties with the English Folk Dance Society, contributing tunes, songs and commentaries to A. G. Gilchrist's three volumes of the Society's Folksong Journal which were dedicated to Manx music, published between 1924 and 1926. Douglas collaborated with Arnold Foster, a pupil of Vaughan Williams, on a set of arrangements of twelve Manx songs, published by Stainer & Bell in 1928. This was to be the first of three such publications, the others appearing in 1929 and 1957, each containing twelve songs. Further to the 36 songs published in these collections, a number of further songs remained unpublished during her lifetime. However, from the total of 46 songs that Douglas claimed to have collected, it has been comprehensively argued that 21 of these were \\"composed songs of one sort or another\\" that originated with Douglas herself.'Mona Douglas and Her Songs' by George Broderick, in \\"Completed and Restored to Use\\": Revival and Dissemination of Manx Folklore and Tradition During the Twentieth Century ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, pp. 117‚Äì154 In 1929 Douglas contributed folklore connected to wells in Lonan to W. Walter Gill's seminal work, A Manx Scrapbook.'Preface' to A Manx Scrapbook by W. Walter Gill, London: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1929 Return to the Isle of Man In 1929 the English Folk Dance Society held its Easter Vacation School on the Isle of Man. Assuming that no Manx folk dance had survived into the modern day, the Society asked Douglas instead to talk to them on local folk song. However, Douglas was able to pull together various notes on Manx dance into a form fit to be presented to the Society.'Who is Mona Douglas?' (2) An Untitled Talk from 1934 ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 116 (2010) Through the assistance of teachers and pupils at Albert Road School in Ramsey, Douglas was able to have three of these reconstructed dances performed: 'The Manx Dirk Dance', 'Hyndaa yn Bwoailley' and 'Eunyssagh Vona'.'The Leighton Stowell Book of Manx Dances (1981)' by Mona Douglas, in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost- Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed.

Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, p. vii The dances proved to be a great success, resulting in an invitation for one of the boys, Billy Caine, to perform the subsequently controversial Manx dirk dance at the All-England Festival at the Royal Albert Hall the following summer. Douglas reported that, \\"The Ramsey schoolboy and his wonderful dance were the sensation of the Festival, and received special notices in all the big London papers.\\"'Who is Mona Douglas?' (7) 'Manx Dances and Manx Youth' ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 116 (2010) Children from the school were also invited to perform other Manx dances at the festival in the following years. Inspired by this success, Douglas then set about collecting, \\"re-building\\" and \\"re- constructing\\" all she could of Manx folk dance. Again in collaboration with Arnold Foster, Douglas published two volumes of Manx dances, in 1936 and 1953. The twelve \\"virile and characteristic dances\\" collected in these volumes, the thirteen new dances that would appear in 1983 in Rinkaghyn Vannin and the incomplete notes on some others amounted to 29 dances in total.'The Revival ad Reconstruction of Manx Traditional Dance' by Robert Corteen Carswell in \\"Completed and Restored to Use\\": Revival and Dissemination of Manx Folklore and Tradition During the Twentieth Century ed.

(4) 'I was brought up in the Isle of Man' ed. Stephen Miller, Manx Notes 118 (2010) Controversy surrounds the authenticity of Douglas' folk collecting, particularly of folk song and dance. Although there is no doubt that she did much collecting, there is also little doubt that she invented or herself composed much of this material.'Introduction to the Second Edition' by Stephen Miller in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, pp. i‚Äìxiv Douglas' fabrication of much material is partly explained by her ultimate aim being to repopularise Manx culture rather than its mere preservation. This is one of the key themes and successes of Douglas' life and work, as expressed in her reaction to the reception of these early dance reconstructions: > \\"I am pleased that the English Folk Dance Society finds them interesting, > and grateful for the help and encouragement given me by certain of its > members, but the main point of my work will have been missed unless the Manx > themselves claim and use their heritage of national dance, which is as truly > a part of national culture as its music or history.\\" It was with this revitalisation of Manx culture in mind that Douglas set up Aeglagh Vannin (\\"the Youth of Mann\\") in 1931.The Isle of Man: A Social, Cultural and Political History (3rd edition) by R. H. Kinvig, Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1975, p. 173 The group held weekly after-school meetings at Albert Road School in Ramsey, \\"for the study of Celtic literature and Manx traditional dance,\\" as well as for the learning of Manx Gaelic and involvement in other Manx cultural and environmental activities. By 1934 the organisation had adopted the motto, Piatchyn jiu, ashoon mairagh (\\"Children today, a nation tomorrow\\"),The Celtic Revolution: A Study in Anti-imperialism by Peter Berresford Ellis, Ceredigion (Cymru): Y Lolfa Cyf., 2000, p. 157 and a song composed for them by Douglas:'A Rallying Song for Aeglagh Vannin' by Mona Douglas (extract) in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance ed.

The organisation had significant success in establishing and raising the profile of Manx folk dance, most notably through appearances on Irish television and radio. However, after periodic lulls of interest, the organisation petered out some time after 1976.'Mona Douglas and Her Songs' by George Broderick, in \\"Completed and Restored to Use\\": Revival and Dissemination of Manx Folklore and Tradition During the Twentieth Century ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, p. 151 Following Douglas' training as a librarian while in Dublin in 1921, she was appointed Rural Librarian under the Department of Education in 1933, where she worked for the next 30 years. Following proposals made in the 1934 annual meeting of The Manx Society, Douglas published a series of weekly Manx lessons in the Mona's Herald newspaper during the Spring of 1935.'A Manx Primer (1935)' by Mona Douglas, in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost-Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, pp. 113‚Äì114 These were printed in book form as Beginning Manx Gaelic: A Manx Primer in 1935, and Lessons in Manx in 1936. Both of these were based on Goodwin's 1901 book, First Lessons in Manx.Manannan's Cloak: An Anthology of Manx Literature, by Robert Corteen Carswell, London: R. Francis Boutle Publishers, 2010, pp.181‚Äì2 This and other of Douglas' efforts demonstrate her belief that Manx Gaelic was a central part of Manx culture that needed to be revitilised: > \\"the salvation of the Manx people, like that of the language, lies with > themselves. At present things look rather black for both of these; but > personally I believe in them both: I believe that the Manx people will yet > work out their economic solution, & that sometime sooner or later, they will > awake to the beauty of their neglected language, & turn to it again with a > rush of appreciation & true national feeling. Till then I am content to > wait, & work as best I can for Ellan Vannin.\\" Leonida Nikolai Giovannelli With the start of World War II, the Isle of Man was chosen as a base for internment camps for enemy aliens. After a short time the rules of detention were relaxed for those internees who posed no threat to the Allies, enabling them to be utilised for work in local Manx farms.Island of Barbed Wire, Connery Chappell, London: Corgi Books Posted to the Douglas' family farm at Ballaragh were a party of Italians from a camp on the promenade at Douglas, amongst them Leonida Nikolai Giovannelli.'An Italian Who Stayed', a part of WW2 People's War on the BBC website (accessed 10 November 2013) After Giovannelli's eventual release from internment, he and Douglas ran an experimental upland farm at the Clarum, close to Douglas' parents' farm. After six years of operation, the farm had to be sold to meet rising debts in 1949. This part of their lives was recorded in Giovannelli's books, Experiments on a Manx Hill Farm (1956) and Exile on an Island (1969).Manninagh ed. Mona Douglas, Douglas: Island Development Co. Ltd., Vol. I, May 1972 By this time Douglas' father had died and when her mother also passed on, in 1953, she inherited 'Thie ny Garee', and she would later expand this to also run the Clarum. Douglas' The Secret Island: Poems and Plays in Verse was published in 1943. In the foreword to the book Douglas explained that the title referred to \\"a place of being known to all mystics and spoken of, though by different names, in all the sacred books of the world: that region of ecstasy on the brink of the final, formless Deep which is the source of all things.\\"'The Secret Island (1943)' by Mona Douglas, in \\"Restoring to Use Our Almost- Forgotten Dances\\": The Collection and Revival of Manx Folk Song and Dance by Mona Douglas, ed. Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004, p. 117 Douglas' next book, Islanders, her only short story collection, was published in 1944 with Giovannelli as the dedicatee. Some of the stories in this collection were re-writes of her plays published in 1921. The heavy influence of Celtic Mysticism on some of these stories can be seen in 'A Son Comes Home', later to be reproduced in Manninagh:'A Son Comes Home' by Mona Douglas, in Manninagh ed. Mona Douglas, Douglas: Island Development Co. Ltd., Vol. I, May 1972 > \\"He realised that the secret magic of heredity had stirred within him [...] > evoking a fragment of that racial past of which our transitory lives are > built, which dwells ever invisibly within us, hidden in the intertices of > time and space save when some rare combination of mood and circumstance > restores it to a fleeting renewal of consciousness in living experience.\\" In 1956 Douglas' sixth and final collection of poetry, Island Magic, was published. The pamphlet was only 19 pages in length.Island Magic on Google Books (accessed 20 November 2013) Later years This is Ellan Vannin Mona Douglas (c. 1981) After retiring from her job as rural librarian at the age of 65, Douglas joined the staff of the Isle of Man Times as a reporter and feature-writer in 1963. Her writings for the Manx newspapers focussed on Manx culture and history and these articles were brought together in a series of five books: This is Ellan Vannin (1965), Christian Tradition in Vannin (1965), This is Ellan Vannin Again: Folklore (1966), They Lived in Ellan Vannin (1968) and We Call it Ellan Vannin (1970). Douglas founded and edited a cultural journal, Manninagh (\\"Manxman\\"). The first edition was published in May 1972 and ranged over a wide field of cultural interests, including Manx theatre, art, crafts, literature, poetry (in English & Gaelic), folklore, banking, farming, fishing, genealogy and conservation. Contributors to this and subsequent editions included a number of important Manx figures of the day, including Charles Kerruish, W. Walter Gill, Leonida Nikolai Giovanelli, Douglas Faragher, Constance Radcliffe and Nancy Gaffikin. Douglas made her intention for the journal clear in her preface to the first edition: > \\"Manninagh [...] is intended to provide a channel for the expression of Manx > cultural interests in various fields, especially for original work in the > arts in the Manx tradition; and it is hoped that it may come to be regarded > as a not unworthy successor to such journals as Mannin and The Manx > Notebook\\" However, there was insufficient interest in such a cultural journal to enable Manninagh to go beyond three editions, the last of which was published in 1973. More successful was The Manxman, a lighter publication, which Douglas edited for thirteen editions between 1971 and 1978. In 1976 Douglas published a novel, Song of Mannin, illustrated by Paul Austwick. The novel was set in the 1790s and formed a fictional background to the well-known Manx song, Ny Kirree fo Niaghtey (\\"The Sheep Under the Snow\\"). This was followed in 1981 with Douglas' sequel, Rallying Song, which follows an American woman who returns to the Manx home of her great-father and reconnects with the Celtic spirit of the country and its people. Both books display Douglas' ethnic essentialism ‚Äì \\"the life-long passion of Mona Douglas for race, blood and tradition.\\"'Introduction' by John Belchem, in A New History of the Isle of Man, Volume V: The Modern Period, 1830 ‚Äì 1999, Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2000, p. 4 Rallying Song proved to be \\"more controversial and overtly nationalist\\" than its predecessor. In 1977, Douglas organised the first meeting of Yn Chruinnaght. Under the title of \\"Feailley Vanninagh Rhumsaa\\" (\\"Ramsey Manx Festival\\") and in collaboration with the Ellynyn ny Gael (\\"Arts of the Gaels\\") organisation, this was a one-day Manx Gaelic culture event held on 1 September. The following year it expanded into a five-day inter-Celtic festival, giving an opportunity for the six Celtic nations of the Isle of Man, Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall to participate. Yn Chruinnaght has since received official recognition from Oireachtas na Gaeilge in Ireland, Yr Orsedd y Beirdd and Yr Eisteddfod Genedlaethol in Wales and An Mod in Scotland. The festival is still going strong today and attracts large attendances annually from across the Celtic nations and beyond. It has been described as the \\"climax\\" of the second wave of the Manx cultural revival between 1920 and 1980. In 1982, Douglas received an MBE, awarded for her outstanding services to Manx culture. This was followed in 1987 with the honour of White Druidic Order, the highest award that the Gorsedd could bestow. Death Just before Christmas 1986 Douglas fell and broke her leg but, in spite of her friends' urgings, she refused to move from her remote cottage. However, within months she had to return to Noble's Hospital, where she died peacefully on 8 October 1987 at the age of 89. She was cremated in Douglas a few days later. Legacy The Reih Bleeaney Vanannan Trophy The estimation of Douglas at the end of her life was immediately shown through a series of memorial services and concerts that followed in the months after her death. This was followed in 1988 with the posthumous awarding of the Reih Bleeaney Vanannan award for outstanding contributions to Manx culture.'Recipients of the Reih Bleeaney Vanannan' on the Culture Vannin website (accessed 15 August 2013) Numerous recent publications have been made on Douglas' life and work, notably Mona Douglas: A Tribute edited by Fenella Bazin in 1998Mona Douglas: A Tribute edited by Fenella Bazin, Douglas: Manx Heritage Foundation, 1998 (available from the Manx Heritage website) and \\"Restoring to use our almost-forgotten dances\\": The collection and revival of Manx folk song and dance edited by Stephen Miller in 2004, the extended proceedings of a one-day conference held in Douglas in April 2000.\\"Restoring to use our almost-forgotten dances\\": The collection and revival of Manx folk song and dance edited by Stephen Miller, Onchan: Chiollagh Books, 2004 (accessed 29 November 2013) In recognition of their lasting national importance, Douglas' papers had been deposited with the archives of the Manx National Heritage Library at her death. These were an unsorted and uncatalogued collection of \\"everything from bank statements and bills to original manuscripts and unpublished works,\\"'The Mona Douglas Papers' on The Manx Heritage Foundation website, www.manxheritage.org (accessed 1 December 2013) until Autumn 2003 when a Culture Vannin grant enabled Dr Breesha Maddrell \\"to sift through them, collate them and then make a detailed assessment of their value and content.\\" Also in 2003, Douglas' 1944 book, Islanders, featured on a Manx stamp. This was as a part of The Manx Bookshelf series of six stamps released by the Isle of Man Post Office to celebrate works of fiction associated with the Isle of Man. Other writers featured included Agatha Christie, Hall Caine and Nigel Kneale.'Isle of Man, 2003' on www.trussel.com (accessed 5 December 2013) In 2012, the 25th anniversary of Douglas' death was marked with a series of events on the Isle of Man, including a special concert of songs and dances held in Peel and recorded for subsequent release on DVD and CD,'Musical Feast in Memory of Mona Douglas' on IOM Today (accessed 2 December 2013) and a talk on her life and work in Ramsey.'Evening Celebrating Mona Douglas' on IOM Today (accessed 2 December 2013) In 2017 a CD/DVD inspired by the work of Mona Douglas was released by Culture Vannin. Mona's Isle: The Legacy of Mona Douglas featured many leading contemporary Manx musicians, including Aalin Clague, Annie Kissack, Bob Carswell, Breesha Maddrell, Clare Kilgallon, Dave Kilgallon, Dave Mclean, Greg Joughin and Mandy Griffin.'CD and DVD remembers Mona Douglas' on IOM Today (accessed 5 October 2017) Two of Douglas' previously unpublished plays were also released in 2017, having been discovered within the archive of Manx dialect plays held by The Michael Players. The plays, The Widow's House and The Anniversary, were published to coincide with the 30th anniversary of her death on 8 October 2017.'Two new Mona Douglas plays released' news item on the Culture Vannin website (accessed 5 October 2018) Although Douglas is recognised as the \\"most influential\\" Manx poet of the 20th Century, interest in her writings has waned since her death. Today she is best remembered for her work to reinvigorate and reignite interest in Manx culture, particularly with regards to Manx music and dance, such as through Yn Chruinnaght. Douglas' \\"extraordinary stamina\\" was all the more remarkable in that she was forced to work \\"tirelessly against the tide of public opinion which saw little value in what she was doing.\\"'Celebrating the Legacy of Mona Douglas in Music and Song' by Valerie Caine, on North American Manx Association -- Blog, 26 September 2012 (accessed 27 December 2013) Douglas' resilience can perhaps be attributed to her basic love of the Isle of Man, as she expressed in many ways during her life: > \\"But behind all the rest, for me, is always the beauty and mystery and glory > of our own Sacred Island, Ellan Vannin in the heart which is for ever our > Mother and Queen to be adored and served, the ideal to be kept inviolate for > those who shall follow us, and so handed on: our inspiration, and our > ultimate rest ‚Äì Ellan Vannin dy bragh!\\" Publications Mona Douglas' 1976 novel, Song of Mannin   (Co-authored with J.

Biography Brown was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the first of two daughters of Benjamin F. Brown, a descendant of Isaac Allerton, and Clara Neal Brown, who contributed to The Youth's Companion. Her sister Ethel became an author and illustrator under the name Ann Underhill. Her family, for ten generations, had only resided in New England, and Brown herself spent her entire life in her family's Beacon Hill home. Brown was valedictorian of the Bowdoin School in 1886. She then attended the Girls' Latin School, where she was friends with Josephine Preston Peabody. She was the driving force behind the newly created school newspaper, The Jabberwock, named by Brown after the poem by Lewis Carroll. They wrote to Carroll for permission to use the name and Carroll wrote back, wishing them \\"all success to the forthcoming magazine\\". The school, now Boston Latin Academy, still publishes The Jabberwock. After graduating in 1891, she attended Radcliffe College, graduating in 1894. While at Girls' Latin School, she was contributing pieces to St. Nicholas Magazine, some illustrated by her sister. Starting in 1898, under the pen name Jean Neal she wrote articles for the St. Louis Globe-Democrat. She also wrote a one-act comedy called Quits (1896) set at a women's college. The miracles of Saint Werburgh, including her resurrection of a goose, from the Chester CathedralHer first children's book, The Book of Saints and Friendly Beasts (1900) was inspired by her first trip abroad, specifically by the carved choir stalls in Chester Cathedral depicting the life of Saint Werburgh. The book retells Christian stories of the animal encounters of various saints. Brown would write other collections retelling old tales for a contemporary child audience. Her In the Days of Giants (1902) featured stories from Norse mythology and remained a standard text in libraries for several generations. Tales of the Red Children (1909), co- written with James MacIntosh Bell, featured Canadian Indian folklore. Abbie Farwell Brown in a 1921 portrait by Margaret F. Richardson Original stories by Brown include The Lonesomest Doll (1901), The Flower Princess (1904), John of the Woods (1909), and The Lucky Stone (1914). She wrote several volumes of children's poetry, including A Pocketful of Posies (1901) and Fresh Posies (1908). Her books of adult poetry, including Heart of New England (1920) and The Silver Stair (1926), were less successful. Brown wrote song lyrics for the Progressive Music Series by Silver, Burdett and Co. She and composer Mabel Wheeler Daniels wrote the song \\"On the Trail\\", which became the official song of the Girl Scouts of the USA. Daniels set Brown's war poem \\"Peace with a Sword\\" to music and it was performed by the Handel and Haydn Society in 1917. Brown's only juvenile biography was of a composer, The Boyhood of Edward MacDowell (1924). Brown was active in New England literary life. She edited the 20-volume Young Folks Library for the publisher Hall and Locke. She was a member of the Boston Authors' Club, the Boston Drama League, the American Folklore Society, the Poetry Society of America, and was president of the New England Poetry Club.

Federal Power Commission, 354 F.2d 608 (2d Cir. 1965) is a United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals case in which a public group of citizens, the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, organized and initiated legal action after the Federal Power Commission approved plans for Consolidated Edison to construct a power plant on Storm King Mountain, New York. The federal regulatory agency had denied that the environmental group could bring action, but the court disagreed, ruling that Scenic Hudson had legal standing because of their \\"special interest in aesthetic, conservational, and recreational aspects\\" of the mountain. This was the first decision of a court to grant standing on such terms, and established a precedent to allow similar public-based environmental groups to engage in legal processes. As Justice Hays stated, \\"the cost of a project is only one of several factors to be considered\\" in addition to \\"the preservation of natural beauty and national historic sites\\" as a basic concern. This 1965 ruling helped to establish the legitimacy of environmental issues and paved the way for lawyers and the courts to play a significant role in all manner of land- use and environmental battles. Background Breakneck Ridge train station across the Hudson This case is part of a 17-year (1963‚Äì1981) dispute. In September, 1962, Consolidated Edison announced plans to build the country's largest pumped-storage, 2,000-megawatt (MW) hydroelectric power plant on Storm King Mountain at a cost of $234 million. The proposed project also required that Con Edison buy about three hundred acres of the Black Rock Forest owned by Harvard University, which was unwilling to sell. In response to the proposal, by November 1963 citizens had formed the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference to provide a stronger unified voice against the project. Despite its opposition, the Federal Power Commission granted Consolidated Edison the right to proceed. The Commission's decision was immediately appealed and the matter was sent to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The timeline below provides a more thorough context of the different cases and significant decisions. Legal framework=Parties involved= Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference was a collection of concerned citizens and other local interests. Several towns joined Scenic Hudson as plaintiffs. The towns were located along both banks of the Hudson River within the vicinity of Storm King Mountain. These surrounding local governments felt as though the development of the storage facility along with the additional transmission lines would adversely affect them. Among them were Phillipstown, Putnam Valley, Cortland, and Yorktown, all on the opposite bank and concerned about the visual impact of the project. Consolidated Edison was, and as of 2013 still is, a large investor-owned utility in New York. It was seeking a reliable source of energy to meet the needs of a then growing population. =Appeals court= This case was tried in the U.S. Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit. It was argued on October 8, 1965 and decided on December 29, 1965. The case was remanded to the Federal Power Commission in the lower courts. The decision was the beginning of what was to become environmental law. The case was presented before Chief Judge J. Edward Lumbard and Circuit Judges Sterry R. Waterman and Hays. The innovative decision was written by Justice Hays. =Issues= The main issue presented in this case is whether aesthetic harm can suffice as an injury-in-fact in order to establish standing. The \\"injury in fact\\" test requires both an \\"injury to a cognizable interest\\" and that \\"the party seeking review be himself among the injured.\\" The Storm King project was to be located in an area of unique beauty and major historical significance. The highlands and gorge of the Hudson offer one of the finest pieces of river scenery in the world. The great German traveler Baedeker called it \\"finer than the Rhine.\\" Petitioners' contention that the Commission must take these factors into consideration in evaluating the Storm King project is justified by the history of the Federal Power Act. Prior to this case, aesthetics were not considered worthy of standing in court. Environmental groups had to demonstrate a harm to a person or people (typically economic harm) before they could be allowed to challenge development in court and be heard. The New York Court of Appeals set aside the Storm King license and remanded to the Federal Power Commission in a decision marking the birth of environmental law. The court stated that \\"The Commission's renewed proceedings must include as a basic concern the preservation of natural beauty and national historic sites, keeping in mind that in our affluent society, the cost of a project is only one of several factors to be considered.\\" In addition, the court ruled that \\"On remand, the Commission should take the whole fisheries question into consideration before deciding whether the Storm King Project is to be licensed.\\"Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission, 354 F. 2d 608 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied. Sub nom. Consolidated Edison v. Hudson River Preservation Conference, 384 U.S. 941 (1966). This also helped to establish some of the largest environmental organizations today. See \\"Catalyst for other action,\\" below.  Opinion of the Court  Presented by Justice Hays on behalf of Chief Justice Lumbard and Justice Waterman. = Standing = In United States law, the Supreme Court of the United States has stated, \\"In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.\\" This case was significant because the court decided the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference was an \\"aggrieved party\\" under ¬ß 313(a) of the Federal Power Act and thus \\"has standing to challenge the Commission's order.\\" They were determined to be an \\"aggrieved party\\" because of their \\"special interest in aesthetic, conservational, and recreational aspects of power development.\\" This was the first example of granting standing on the basis of aesthetic or environmental benefits. = Commission = The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held the following: * Commission violated requirements of ¬ß10(a) and ¬ß313(b) of Federal Power Act by failing to compile record adequate to support its findings and by failing to consider alternatives to the proposed project, including no project at all. * Commission failed to weigh adequately the need to preserve an area of unique beauty and major historical significance for \\"recreational purposes\\" as expressly mandated by Act. * Commission illegally failed to consider such alternatives as a gas turbine system, an interconnection with other systems, or a combination of the two. * Commission illegally failed to consider the possibility that no device could adequately protect fish and fish larvae in the project area and further failed to consider the desirability of running segments of the transmission lines underground. Remand The licensing order of March 9 and the two orders of May 6 were set aside, and the case was remanded for further Federal Power Commission hearings.  Judicial timeline  The Storm King Decision incorporates 15 years of legal challenges, beginning with the first case in 1965. Below is the timeline: * 1963: Initial proposal for Storm King plant is developed, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference established * 1964: Federal Power Commission (FPC) holds hearings on the proposed plant. They grant Consolidated Edison the license to build plant * 1965: First case: Consolidated Edison Vs. Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, Towns of Phillipsville, Putnam Valley, Cortland. Court remands case to lower court and acknowledges the aesthetic and historical importance of Storm King Mountain and grants standing to a citizen environmental group. * 1966‚Äì1967: The remanded FPC hearings take place. There are over 19,000 pages of testimony. Many additional environmental studies are presented including studies showing the predicted number of fish kills from the plant. * 1968: Almost one year after the hearings ended, the FPC recommends that the license be granted for the Storm King Project. * 1968‚Äì1970: Alternative sites and routes are examined by FPC. They determined that the alternate site is a major hazard to the New York City aqueduct. This eliminates the possibility of the alternate location. The FPC again examines the potential of the Storm King Mountain Site. In August 1970 the FPC re-licensed Storm King. * 1971: Scenic Hudson, the Hudson River Fisherman's Association (now Riverkeeper), The City of New York, the Palisades Park Commission and others appealed the Federal Power Commission decision. The Court upholds the FPC licensing decision in a two-to-one vote. The court later split four-to-four on reconsideration. (453 F. 2d 463 (2d Cir. 1971), cert. denied 407 U.S. 926 (1972)). * 1973: Once again, Scenic Hudson and the Hudson River Fisherman's Association petitioned the Federal Power Commission to reconsider the Storm King license. They allege that the fish studies used in the 1970 license granting were inaccurate. The study did not consider that the Hudson is a tidal river and therefore underestimated impact to certain fish. The Federal Power Commission later rejected the Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Fisherman's Association Petitions. (49 FPC 1227 (1973)). * 1973: Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Fisherman's Association bring suit against the US Army Corps of Engineers in federal district court to stop Consolidated Edison from dumping rock excavated from the Storm King project into the Hudson River. They argued that a Corps of Engineers permit was required. Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Callaway, 370 F. Supp. 162 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), aff'd 499 f.2d 127 (2d Cir. 1974). * 1976: NY City Attorney General and some FPC staff join Scenic Hudson and Hudson River Fisherman's Association in petitioning the Federal Power Commission to restart hearings on the Storm King license. This time they include economics in the argument along with changed circumstances and environmental concerns. * 1980: Scenic Hudson and Consolidated Edison reached a settlement in the Storm King case. Consolidated Edison agreed to terminate the Storm King plans, reduce fish kills at some of its power plants on the Hudson. They also established a research fund for the Hudson River. The surrender was approved by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in 1981.  Catalyst for other action  The Court's decision to grant standing to the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, a conservation group with local members, established an important legal precedence for similar groups to be able to take legal action to protect the public interest. This case has been attributed as the birth of environmental law, which is now so firmly established, it is taught as a separate branch of legal studies at most law schools today. = Related cases = This case sets a precedent for \\"attainment of standing to sue than for justiciability of aesthetic issues on their merits.\\" Within each case, it is important that aesthetic conditions be specifically mentioned within the applicable statutes. In the case of Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission case, this was the Federal Power Act. * Izaak Walton League of America v. St. Clair (1970): in response to mineral claims in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area. * Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe (1971): lawsuit in response to a proposed highway corridor through a municipal park. This case contained environmental issues with aesthetic factors, but also had particular statutory language examined. * U.S. v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP) (1973): students found to have alleged individual standing because assigning higher transport tariffs would encourage use of raw materials over recycled materials. Though the students had standing, they eventually lost the case. * Parker v. US (1971): lawsuit in response to a proposed forest timber sale. This case contained environmental issues with aesthetic factors, but also had particular statutory language examined. * Sierra Club v. Morton (1972): The key issue in the case was whether the permitted development would cause the Sierra Club sufficient injury to give them standing to sue to block the permit. The Supreme Court held that the Sierra Club, in its corporate capacity, lacked standing, but that it may sue on behalf of any of its members who had individual standing because the government action affected their aesthetic or recreational interests. However, the Sierra Club had failed to state in its complaint that any of its members had ever visited Mineral King, even though several members had used it for recreational purposes and even owned property in the nearby area, and so it lost. * Friends of the Earth v. Armstrong (1973). = Policy change = Though a powerful tool for environmental action, private litigation does not replace the proactive approach of states and the federal government establishing environmental standards. = Environmental organizations = The Natural Resources Defense Council started in 1970 from a partnership including attorneys of the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, led by Stephen Duggan.

Although forced marriages exist in areas under insurgent control, there is generally very little voluntary prostitution in the country according to the African Medical Research and Education Foundation (AMREF). UNAIDS estimated there were 10,957 sex workers in Somalia in 2016. Sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems in the country. Legislation Prostitution laws in Somalia are contained in the Penal Code of 1960, which was based on the Italian Penal Code of 1930. The relevant articles are: * Article 405 Prostitution * Article 406 Incitement to Lewd Acts (prohibits solicitation) * Article 407 Instigation, Aiding and Exploiting of Prostitution * Article 408 Compulsion to Prostitution The laws are currently under review. HIV HIV/AIDS prevalence rates are quite low in the country, estimated at 0.7% of adults. This has been attributed to Somalia's dominant Muslim tradition and adherence to Islamic morals, which generally discourage premarital and extramarital sexual activity. Sex workers are a high risk group and their estimated HIV prevalence rate was 5.2% in 2014. Condom use amongst sex workers is low. Sex trafficking Somalia is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Information regarding trafficking in Somalia remains extremely difficult to obtain or verify. Victims are primarily from Somalia's southern and central regions and subjected to trafficking within the country, especially in Puntland and Somalia in the south. In Somalia, women act as recruiters and intermediaries who transport victims to Puntland, Djibouti, and Ethiopia for the purposes of sex trafficking. Due to poverty and an inability to provide care for all family members, some Somalis willingly surrender custody of their children to people with whom they share familial ties and clan linkages; some of these children may become victims of sex trafficking. In 2014, an international NGO released a report documenting cases of sexual abuse and exploitation, including trafficking, of Somali women and girls by Ugandan and Burundian African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) personnel. An African Union investigation into the allegations concluded there was evidence of sexual exploitation, abuse, and trafficking by AMISOM personnel. Regional governments from Somalia and Puntland reported smuggling and trafficking continued through Somalia as a transit point on routes to Libya, Sudan, and Europe. Women and girl migrants working in the informal economy were particularly vulnerable to trafficking. Certain marginalised ethnic minorities, Somali Bantus and Midgaan, continue to face greater risk of sex trafficking, as do IDPs and people living in areas under al-Shabaab control. Self-identified administrators of some IDP camps reportedly force girls and women to provide sex acts in exchange for food and services; some Somali officials are alleged to be complicit in such exploitation. Traffickers transport Somali women, sometimes via Djibouti, to the Middle East, where they frequently endure domestic forced prostitution. Some members of the Somali diaspora use false offers of marriage to lure unsuspecting victims, many of whom include relatives, to Europe or the United States, where they force them into prostitution. Trucks transporting goods from Kenya to Somalia sometimes return to Kenya with young girls and women; traffickers procure these young girls and women and exploit them in brothels in Nairobi or Mombasa or send them to destinations outside Kenya. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Somalia as a 'Special Case' country.

Surgical mesh is a loosely woven sheet which is used as either a permanent or temporary support for organs and other tissues during surgery. Surgical mesh is created from both inorganic and biological materials and is used in a variety of surgeries. Though hernia repair surgery is the most common application, it can also be used for reconstructive work, such as in pelvic organ prolapse. Permanent meshes remain in the body, whereas temporary ones dissolve over time. For example, TIGR Matrix test mesh was shown in 2012 to fully dissolve after three years in a scientific trial on sheep. Some types of mesh combine permanent and temporary meshes such as Vipro, which includes both re- absorbable vipryl, made from polyglycolic acid, and prolene, a non- reabsorbable polypropylene. Data of mechanical and biological behaviors of mesh in vivo may not always be concurrent within the human body due to testing in other organisms. Most published reports experiment on mice, thus creating the likelihood of possible differences when inserted into the human body. Also, most published research reports reference meshes that are currently removed from the medical device market due to complications post-surgery. Additionally, the absence of FDA-approved regulatory protocols and universal standard operating procedures leads to a variety of different testing methods from researcher to researcher. Experimentation may find differing outcomes for some meshes.  Medical uses  The primary function of surgical mesh is to support prolapsed organs either temporarily or permanently. It is most commonly used in hernia surgery within the abdomen, which is required when an organ protrudes through abdominal muscles. Surgical mesh may also be used for pelvic or vaginal wall reconstructions in women and is implemented to add as a growth guide for damaged tissue. Ideally, these implants should be strong enough to survive mechanical loads and actions of whichever body area they become a part of. = Hernia surgery = Hernia surgery is one of the most common current applications of surgical mesh. Hernias occur when organs or fatty tissue bulge through openings or debilitated areas of muscle, usually in the abdominal wall. Surgical mesh is implanted to strengthen tissue repair and minimize the rate of recurrence. The surgery can be performed laparoscopic (internally) or open with a variety of materials available for prosthesis. Polypropylene (PP) is the most frequently used type of mesh, although it may be uncomfortable for the patient after implantation. Another type that is less utilized in hernia surgery is polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which faces complications in that fact that it easily degrades after some years of implantation, erasing the effects of the surgery. Polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) is used as well, but is manufactured in the form of a foil and has difficulty integrating into surrounding tissue, therefore it loses stability. = Pelvic surgery = Similar to hernia surgery, synthetic meshes may be used for organ prolapses in the pelvic region as well. Pelvic organ prolapse occurs in 50% of women above the age of 50 with a history of one or more vaginal childbirths throughout her lifetime. Mesh surgery can be performed in various areas of the pelvic region, such as cystocele, rectocele, and vaginal vault or uterus. The most commonly used material, as in hernia surgery, is PP, which is considered to have acceptable biocompatibility within the region. It induces a mild inflammatory response but has a tendency to adhere to the viscera. The vaginal wall has three layers: tunica mucosa, muscularis, adventitia. When prolapse occurs, smooth fibers of the muscularis are compromised. Prolapse in women has also been seen to increase stiffness in the pelvis, particularly post-menopausal women. Surgical mesh that is used in pelvic reconstruction must counter this stiffness, but if the modulus of elasticity is too high, it will not sufficiently support the organs. On the contrary, if the mesh is too stiff, tissue will erode and inflammatory responses will cause post-surgical complications. Post-implantation, polypropylene mesh sometimes exhibits microcracks, flaking of fibers, and fibrosis. Additionally, the mesh has enough strength to withstand basic actions and tissue behavior in physiological conditions, particularly during tissue regeneration through the mesh itself. The area is subjected to a variety of loads approaching from abdominal contents, pressure from abdominal/diaphragm muscles, and genital organs, as well as respiratory actions. For the average, reproductive-age woman, the pelvis must withstand loads of 20 N in the supine position, 25-35 N in the standing position, and 90-130 N whilst coughing. Any mesh that is implanted in the pelvic area must be strong enough to withstand these loads.  Regulation  In 2018, the United Kingdom temporarily halted vaginal mesh implants for treatment of urinary incontinence pending further investigation into the risks and available safeguards. In the United States, the FDA reclassified transvaginal surgical mesh as \\"class III\\" (high risk) in 2016, and in late 2018, mandated premark approval applications for mesh intended for transvaginal pelvic organ prolapse repair, with further investigation planned in 2019. Then on April 16, 2019, the FDA ordered all makers of transvaginal surgical meshes to immediately stop their sale and distribution.  Biocompatibility  Polypropylene (PP) mesh is currently used in both hernia and pelvic organ prolapses, but may not always be the most biocompatible option. Mesh implantation will naturally generate an inflammatory response to the inserted mesh, but biocompatibility ranges from how easily it is integrated to how severe the foreign body reaction is. A minimal response includes the formation of fibrosis around the prosthesis (much like in scar tissue formation); this response is generated with the best form of biocompatibility. A physical response triggers an acute inflammatory reaction, which involves the formation of giant cells and subsequently granulomas, meaning that the tissue is ‚Äútolerating‚Äù the mesh fairly well. Lastly, a chemical response allows for a severe inflammatory reaction during attempted tissue-mesh integration, including fibroblastic cell proliferation. Ultimately, the goal for surgical mesh creation is to formulate one that has a minimal in vivo reaction to maximize comfort for the patient, avoid infection, and ensure clean integration into the body for tissue repair. A number of factors play into mesh biocompatibility. Mesh porosity is the ratio of pore to total area, and plays a role in the development of either bacterial infection or smooth tissue regeneration depending on pore size. Pore sizes below 10 micrometers are susceptible to infection because bacteria may enter and proliferate, while macrophages and neutrophils are too large to fit through and cannot aid in the elimination of them. With pore sizes exceeding 75 micrometers, fibroblasts, blood vessels, and collagen fibers are permitted through as part of tissue regeneration. Although there is no general consensus on the best pore size, it can be deduced that larger pores are better for development of tissue and integration in vivo. Knowing this, the current problem with a variety of the meshes used in all types of surgeries is that they are not sufficiently biocompatible. PP proves an effective mesh for adjusting prolapsed organs, but may cause severe discomfort for the patient due to its high modulus of elasticity. This stiffens the prosthesis and results in a more pronounced inflammatory response, which complicates integration into the body with tissue ingrowth. As previously mentioned, PET too easily degrades in vivo and tissue has a difficult time integrating with PTFE. For these reasons, researchers are beginning to look for different types of surgical mesh that may be suitable for the biological environment and provide better comfort while supporting prolapsed organs. = PVDF (nanofibrous mesh) = One particular type of mesh that is under study is polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), or nanofibrous mesh, which has been found to be more resistant to hydrolysis and disintegration, unlike PET, and does not increase its stiffness in its age, unlike PP. It is being tested for both hernia and pelvic/vaginal wall surgery and is produced via fiber placement layer by layer, whereas PP is constructed by a weaving-like process. This gives the nanofibrous mesh a heavyweight yet low-porosity structure, also adding greater stiffness and stress threshold when compared to PP. This is supported by the foundation of HSP 70‚Äîan indicator for cell stress and protector of cell formation against damage, which is beneficial for the prosthesis and tissue formation‚Äîwhich has been monitored and observed in a larger presence in PVDF. In vitro observations of nanofibrous mesh have yielded evidence of cell migration and proliferation on the set of the mesh. Successful cell growth has been noted with long fusiform shapes and clear boundaries. A significant advantage of using nanofibrous mesh is that it can carry far more stem cells than traditional PP mesh, which could improve cell- based therapy for pelvic organs prolapse and regeneration methods. Another important advantage of PVDF is the formation of capillaries after 12 weeks, which is essential for wound-healing. The faster neovascularization occurs, the faster tissue can be repaired and regenerated, which decreases the likelihood of suffering from exposure or extrusion of the mesh. Some enhancements to PVDF must also be made before it can be used for human surgery. Although the modulus of elasticity is higher than that of PP, resulting stretch under identical stress is much smaller, which could cause complications such as tissue degeneration and loss of mechanical soundness. Nanofibrous mesh currently also promotes a greater foreign body reaction and inflammatory response, which is faulty for biocompatibility purposes of the mesh. For these reasons, PVDF is still under consideration and experimentation for bodily implants. = Reduction of inflammatory response using MSCs = Inflammatory responses to mesh insertion promote tissue formation around mesh fibers and proliferation of fibroblasts, polymorphonucleocytes, and macrophages, which all aid in the integration of mesh. Failures to resolve inflammatory responses may lead to foreign body reactions and the ultimate encapsulation of the implant which negates any functional purpose that the implant was supposed to serve. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to reduce inflammatory responses which, when combined with surgical mesh, could prevent them from getting uncontrollable and too difficult to tame. MSCs combined with surgical meshes can be used as ‚Äúoff the shelf‚Äù products and enhance macrophage polarization in both in vivo and in vitro environments. This can encourage an anti-inflammatory response and can regulate the inflammatory reaction associated with mesh implantation.

His dissertation argued for the liberalization of vocational and career education based on the concern that these programs indoctrinated students into a neo-liberal mindset (Hyslop- Margison, 2005). Much of his work challenges contemporary neo-liberal values that situate economic objectives as the sole purpose of education (Hyslop- Margison, 2007). Hyslop-Margison's most recent scholarship argues that neo- liberalism is no longer sustained through ideological manipulation, but increasingly through the use of brute force, or the repressive state apparatus (Althusser, 1971).

He played in the Cuban National Series for Cienfuegos before his defection in August 2013. After being granted free agency by MLB, Abreu signed with the White Sox in October 2013. Since 2013, Abreu has performed primarily as a first baseman, however he has also filled in at designated hitter for the White Sox. Professional career=Cuban career= Abreu set a Cuban home run record in 2010‚Äì2011 and was named league MVP. He had played five seasons in the Cuban Serie Nacional through 2007‚Äì2008, hitting .295 and slugging .467. After 48 games in 2008‚Äì2009, he was batting .345/.368/.600, earning the infielder a spot on Cuba's provisional roster for the 2009 World Baseball Classic. He did not make the final cut and finished the season with a .346/.441/.630 batting line. He led the 2008-09 Cuban National Series with 30 times hit by pitch. He tied Yenier Bello and Alex Guerrero for 8th in homers (19), was 8th in slugging and 4th in strikeouts (69). Abreu was 2 for 10 in the 2009 World Port Tournament, backing up Ariel Borrero at first base. In the 2009 Baseball World Cup, he hit .250/.333/.469 in his first major tournament. He was listed in the IBAF's Final Report as being one of the All-Star outfielders alongside teammate Alfredo Despaigne and Jon Weber, but other sources list Puerto Rico's Miguel Abreu, who had better statistics. He was not even used as a starter in the outfield, playing alongside Ariel Borrero at first. In the Gold Medal game, he did not appear as Borrero saw the action. Abreu in the 2013 World Baseball Classic In 2009‚Äì2010, Abreu had his best year yet, hitting .400/.555/.822 with 82 runs, 30 homers, 76 RBI and 74 walks to 49 strikeouts in 89 games. He tied Leonys Mart√≠n for 6th in the Serie Nacional in runs, tied for third with 25 doubles, tied Yulieski Gourriel for second in home runs (one behind Alfredo Despaigne in a to-the-wire home run race), was third with 235 total bases (behind Despaigne and Gourriel), again led with 30 times hit by pitch, tied Enrique Esteban D√≠az for 4th in walks, led with 32 intentional walks (12 more than runner-up Yosvany Peraza), was second in average (.005 behind Despaigne), led in slugging (.008 over Despaigne) and probably led in OBP. He was named the All-Star first baseman. Abreu was Cuba's starting first baseman when they won the 2010 Intercontinental Cup, their first Gold in an international tournament in three years. He hit .292/.320/.500. In the finale, he went 1 for 3 and scored the first run in the victory over the Dutch national baseball team; he doubled off Rob Cordemans in the third and came home on a Yorbis Borroto hit. He helped Cuba finish second at the 2010 Pan American Games Qualifying Tournament. In the 2010 World University Baseball Championship, he posted the best average by going 10 for 18 with 2 walks, a double, triple, four homers, 9 runs and 12 RBI in six games as Cuba won the Gold. He was 0 for 4 in the finale, as Cuba edged Team USA. He was named the event's All-Star 1B. Abreu continued to improve in 2010‚Äì11 Cuban National Series with one of the greatest seasons in Cuban history. He hit .453/.597/.986 with 79 runs, 93 RBI and 33 home runs in only 66 games. Despite missing 23 games due to bursitis in his shoulder, he broke Despaigne's home run record (as did Yoenis C√©spedes ‚Äì both hit their 33rd on the season's last day). Despaigne would reclaim the record a year later. Abreu led the league in average (.052 over Michel Enr√≠quez), slugging (a whopping .212 over runner-up Frederich Cepeda), intentional walks (21) and homers (tied with Yoenis C√©spedes), was second in RBI (6 behind C√©spedes), tied for 8th in runs with Donal Duarte, was 7th in total bases (209) and 4th in times hit by pitch (21). Had he not been injured, he would have likely easily won a Triple Crown. He won Cuban National Series Most Valuable Player Award. He was the second MVP from Cienfuegos, following Pedro Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, Sr. by 31 years. Abreu was named to the Cuban national baseball team for the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In Cuba's six games, he batted .383 and hit three home runs while recording nine RBIs. =Chicago White Sox= In August 2013, Abreu defected from Cuba to test the MLB free agent market. His defection was later confirmed by former teammate Henry Urrutia. He established residency in the Dominican Republic and was named a free agent. In October, he signed a six-year contract with the Chicago White Sox worth $68 million. On the White Sox, Abreu joined fellow Cuban players Alexei Ram√≠rez, Day√°n Viciedo, and Rule 5 draft pick Adrian Nieto. Abreu with the White Sox in 2017 Abreu recorded his first major league hit on March 31, 2014, against the Minnesota Twins.

On July 6, Abreu was selected to the 2014 MLB All-Star Game along with teammates Alexei Ram√≠rez and Chris Sale. At the All- Star Break, Abreu had a .292 batting average with 73 RBIs and an MLB-leading 29 home runs. During the season, Abreu was named both player of the month and rookie of the month for April & July. Nobody in baseball had ever won both awards in the same month twice in one season. Having won the rookie honor in June, Abreu became only the fourth player to win the Rookie of the Month honor three or more times in a season. Abreu finished the season with a White Sox rookie record 36 home runs. He won the 2014 Sporting News American League Rookie of the Year Award. He was awarded the AL Silver Slugger Award for first basemen, becoming the only White Sox first baseman besides Frank Thomas to ever gain the honor. Abreu was unanimously named the 2014 AL Rookie of the Year by the BBWAA on November 10, 2014. 2017 was an incredible year for Abreu in which he held many of the top 20 ranks within Major League Baseball.

She has represented her country a total of 382 times in which she won six European titles, was the runner-up at 2010 and 2014 World Championships, won silver medals at the 2008 Summer Paralympic Games in Beijing and 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, and won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, for which President Joachim Gauck awarded the team Germany's highest sporting honour, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf). Following the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games, Zeyen retired from wheelchair basketball to pursue alternative sporting challenges as an individual athlete. Biography Zeyen was born on 17 February 1985. She is nicknamed \\"Anni\\". At the age of 14, she was involved in a serious horse riding accident that left her paralysed. During rehab, she was introduced to the sport of wheelchair basketball. She left the hospital and started looking for a club where she could play.  Wheelchair Basketball  Zeyen joined ASV Bonn, initially playing with the youth team, then with the seconds, and finally with the firsts. In 2001, she played in the German Championships for Women, and was named most valuable young player. In 2004, she switched to RSV Lahn-Dill, with which she won several German championships. She was invited to try out for the national team, and joined its development squad. She competed in her first paralympic games, the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens. She subsequently played for the national team that won the European championships in 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011. In September 2008, Zeyen participated in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, but Germany was beaten in the gold medal match by the United States team, which contained three of her former team mates from the University of Alabama, Stephanie Wheeler, Mary Allison Milford and Alana Nichols. The German team took home Paralympic silver medals instead. After the Paralympics, the team's performance was considered impressive enough for it to be named the national \\"Team of the Year\\", and it received the Silver Laurel Leaf, Germany's highest sporting honour, from German President Horst Koehler. Zeyen took up a scholarship to the University of Alabama in 2009, majoring in advertising and minoring in graphic design. She maintained a 4.0 grade point average. Her team at the University of Alabama won three titles in five years, narrowly missing out in March 2013 to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìWhitewater, which won the championship game 55‚Äì41, a game in which Zeyen scored 11 points. Zeyen was named an Academic All-American in 2012 and 2013. In June 2012, Zeyen was named as one of the team that competed at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. In the Gold Medal match, her team faced Australia, a team that had defeated them 48‚Äì46 in Sydney just a few months before. They defeated the Australians 58‚Äì44 in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball in 28 years. They were awarded a Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were again named Team of the Year for 2012. The German team lost the European Championship to the Netherlands before a home town crowd of 2,300 in Frankfurt in July 2013 by a point, 56-57. The game was televised live in Germany, and cameras lingered on a tearful Zeyen, who could have tied the game and sent it into extra time with a free throw in its dying moments. In April 2014, Zeyen was part of the BG Baskets Hamburg team that won the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation Euro League Challenge Cup, its first International title, with a 62‚Äì54 over the Frankfurt Mainhatten Skywheelers. The team also won the Fair Play Award of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation Europe, and Zeyen was elected to its All Star team. The German team claimed silver at the 2014 Women's World Wheelchair Basketball Championship in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and beat the Netherlands in the 2015 European Championships, to claim its tenth European title. At the 2016 Paralympic Games, it won silver after losing the final to the United States. Zeyen was selected as the German flag bearer in the closing ceremony.  Wheelchair Athletics  Following the completion of the 2016 Games, Zeyen decided to retire from wheelchair basketball to pursue a career in wheelchair athletics. She won every race she competed in at the German national championships in May 2017, setting new national records in the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m, and qualifying for the 2017 World Championships in London after only six months in the sport. Later that year she finished 6th in the TCS New York Marathon in a time of 2:07:23.  Handbiking  In January 2019, Zeyen switched her focus to hand-biking under her wheelchair athletics coach, Alois Gmeiner. She is classified as an H3 athlete. In her first year competing she finished runner up in her first World Cup Road Race in Baie-Comeau, Canada and ended the season ranked 4th in the world in her classification. As a result of this impressive first competitive season, Zeyen was selected for the German National team to compete at the 2019 Para-cycling Road World Championships in Emmen, Netherlands. Zeyen was selected to compete in the individual time trial and road race as well as the mixed relay team alongside Vico Merklein (H3M) and Bernd Jeffre (H4M). The team finished third after the Spanish team were penalized time for forcing Merklein off the road on the final corner of the race. This victory guaranteed a place for the German team in the relay at the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. On 15 September 2019, Zeyen competed in the Women's H3 Road Race at the World Championships and took home the rainbow jersey and was crowned World Champion at her first attempt, beating pre-race favorite Alica Dana from the United States by a little over 1 second. Annika completed the 51.8 km race in a time of 1 hour 37 minutes and 41 seconds.

The term \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\" is sometimes used as a generic name for types of variant, or for all variants, irrespective of the titles and/or the lyrics of the source material. For example, writing in the United States, Lodewick (1955), referring to a group of early variants that involve a soldier and a camp follower, as opposed to a group of versions that involve a prostitute, writes, \\"For identification, I shall call this by its most popular title, \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\". Lodewick, K ‚ÄúThe Unfortunate Rake\\" and His Descendants. Western Folklore Vol. 14, No. 2 (April 1955), pp. 98-109 A follow-up piece by Goldstein (1959) in the same journal refers to \\"The Rake Cycle\\".Goldstein K (1959) Western Folklore Vol. 18, No. 1. pp. 35-38 The variant or variants on which these writers base their use of the title \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\" are not cited. Early twentieth century British references to this title are references to a tune, not to song lyrics, with the idea that the tune may have originally been used for a song called \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\" being offered as a conjecture.Songs from the Collection of Mr Frank Kidson\\", Journal of the Folk Song Society, Vol 1, No 5, p 254. According to Bishop and Roud (2014), the earliest-known variant, a late eighteenth- century/early nineteenth-century broadside in the Madden Collection, is called \\"The Buck's Elegy\\"Bishop, J. and Roud, S (2014) The New Penguin Book of English Folk Songs, Penguin Classics, Kindle Edition.. This is the lament of a young man about town, set in Covent Garden, a well-known haunt of London prostitutesAnon (1773, \\"Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies or Man of Pleasure's Kalendar for the year 1773\\", an annually printed list of prostitutes.. The moribund young man bewails the fact that he did not know what was wrong with him in time, in which case he could have taken mercury to treat the ailment, and he makes requests about his funeral. This version includes what Bishop and Roud refer to as 'explicit clues' that the persona has venereal disease in the form of references to mercury and other treatments for that disease. Bishop and Roud state: 'Despite the number and variety of collected versions, the early history of the song is still unclear, and surprisingly few nineteenth-century broadside copies have survived.' They state that the song probably dates from 1740 or earlier, but that 'at present we have no evidence to support such a theory'. Some versions, they explain, provide clues to venereal disease as the cause of the persona's woes; others 'manage to avoid or disguise this element'. They also comment that many versions incorporate a 'military-style' funeral, with pipes and drums and rifles. They describe it as 'one of the most versatile songs in the Anglo- American tradition, as it seems able to adapt itself to any group or situation.' A nineteenth century broadside published by Such printers of London is referred to in some twentieth century literature on the song. This version, and several others of that time, is called \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\". The first line of this song is 'As I was a walking down by the Lock Hospital.' This term, which referred to a hospital for the treatment of venereal diseases, is another item referred to by Bishop and Roud as an 'explicit hint'. Several digitised images of broadside version of this song may be found onlinehttp://ballads.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/static/images/sheets/10000/06656.gif. In 1911, Phillips Barry, who had studied folklore at Harvard, published an article claiming that the origins of \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\" were to be found in a fragment called \\"My Jewel, My Joy\\"Barry, P (1911) Irish Folk Song. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 24, No. 93. pp 332-343. His argument was based on a one-verse fragment provided with a tune of the same name. This had been collected by William Forde in Cork and published in 1909 by P W JoyceJoyce PW (1909) Old Irish Folk Music and Songs, Boston.. The single verse is as follows: > My jewel, my joy, don't trouble me with the drum, > Play the dead march as my corpse goes along; > And over my body throw handfuls of laurel, > And let them all know that I'm going to my rest. > The many variants feature various young soldiers, sailors, maids and cowboys, being \\"cut down in their prime\\" and contemplating their deaths. It has been claimed that a similar story set to a different tune become the standard \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\"e.g.Lloyd, A L (1956) \\"Background to St James' Infirmary\\", Sing Magazine, Vol 3, pp19-21. This claim has been disputed on various grounds.See, for example, Harwood, Robert W ((2015) 'I Went Down to St James Infirmary, Canada, Harland Press. Kenneth Lodewick commented: 'No folk connection has been shown, but the composer of the hit tune apparently knew the tradition - and used itLodewick, K ‚ÄúThe Unfortunate Rake\\" and His Descendants. Western Folklore Vol. 14, No. 2 (Apr., 1955), p.99. In the 2018 Katharine Briggs Memorial Lecture, Professor Richard Jenkins discusses several aspects of what he calls the 'folkloristic narrative' relating to these songs. He asserts that several aspects of this narrative may be shown to be 'dubious, if not incorrect', and suggests that the way in which a 'misleading tale' became accepted as 'conventional knowledge' has implications for those engaged in the study of folklore.Jenkins, R 'The Unfortunate Rake's Progress: A Case Study of the Construction of Folklore by Collectors and Scholars'. Folklore, Volume 130, Issue No 2, June 2019 Synopsis In nineteenth-century broadside versions, the narrator meets a comrade outside a lock hospital. Despite the weather the comrade is wrapped up in flannel. When asked why, he replies that he has been wronged by a woman, sometimes inferred to be a prostitute or camp follower, but in the Such and Carrot broadsides referred to as 'my heart's delight'. She failed to warn him when she 'disordered' him, so he was unable to obtain 'salts and the pills of white mercury', and he is dying, complaining that he has been \\"cut down in my prime\\". He has ignored the warnings of his father that his 'wicked ways would never do'. He asks the narrator to arrange for him a specific funeral, for his coffin to be carried by six 'jolly fellows', his 'pall' by six 'pretty maidens'. They should carry 'bunches of roses' to cover the smell of the corpse. He further instructs that they should 'muffle their drums' but \\"play their pipes merrily\\", specifying the 'dead march' as music, and asking for 'guns' to be fired 'right over my coffin'. These instructions have sometimes been construed in the literature about the song as a request for a 'military funeral'Lloyd, A L (1956) \\"Background to St James' Infirmary\\", Sing Magazine, Vol 3, pp19-21. Another version (Streets of Laredo) says, \\"Play the fife lowly.\\"See Burl Ives Cowboy's Lament. Variants Lists of variants appear both online and in the literature on the song. One source of documentation is the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library at the English Folk Dance and Song Society. The Broadside Index and the Folk Song Index are both compiled by Steve Roud and are searchable online. Tunes A number of different variants use the same melody, including the sub-family known as \\"The Cowboy's Lament\\", of which \\"Streets of Laredo\\" is perhaps currently the best known. This tune is also used for a different song, \\"The Bard of Armagh\\". The nineteenth century broadsheet versions from the British Isles were printed without tunes. In 1904, it was conjectured that words of the song \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\" had originally been sung to an Irish tune called \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\", which had been printed with different words, or no words, in two collections of Irish tunes, one by Crosby, the other by Belden.. For example, the words provided for the air \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\" by Crosby are about a wandering harpist from Connaught, who is seeking pity and hospitality from his listeners. English folk song collectors in the early twentieth century found different tunes being used for variants. The melody for a variant called \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\", set in Rippleton Gardens, was published in 1904\\"Songs from the Collection of Mr Frank Kidson\\", Journal of the Folk Song Society, Vol 1, No 5, pp 228-257.. Another melody, this time to a variant called \\"The Young Girl Cut Down in Her Prime\\", was collected in 1909 and published in 1913Songs From Various Counties, Journal of the Folk Song Society, Vol 4, No 17, p 325.. The tune is noted as \\"mixolydian with dorian influence\\". In a note to this article, Cecil Sharp reported that he had collected six different tunes for this song, and he published the ones he stated were the \\"two best tunes - both of the Henry Martin type\\". The first is labelled \\"dorian\\", the second \\"aeolian/dorian\\". In 1915, yet another tune was published in the Journal of the Folk Song Society; this time stated to be similar to one used for rush-cart Morris dancing at Moston, near Manchester, England\\"Songs of Love and Country Life\\", Journal of the Folk Song Society, Vol 5, No 19, p 193. In 1918, English folk song collector Cecil Sharp, who was visiting the US, collected a version which used the phrase \\"St James' Hospital\\" in Dewey, Virginia. This song was called \\"The Sailor Cut Down in His Prime\\". Sharp's field notes were available for researchers, though the song was not published until after Sharp's death, when his collaborator, Maud Karpeles, produced a second volume of songs from the Southern AppalachiansKarpeles, M (Ed) Sharp C (1936) English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians, Vol 2, . By 1937, the English Folk Song Society had become the English Folk Dance and Song Society, and in that year, another tune was published, this time to accompany a variant beginning with a reference to \\"Bath Hospital\\"Journal of the EFDS Society, Vol 3, No 2, December 1937, p 129 . The tune is described as 'dorian'. In the 1950s a version sung by A L Lloyd and called 'The Unfortunate Rake' was released, with Kenneth Goldstein as editor of the LP called 'Street Songs of England', and the same version was included on Goldstein's later Folkways LP, \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\". Though this version is described on the liner notes as a nineteenth century broadside version, and is often taken as such in subsequent literature, Lloyd's practice in the past had been to publish 'composite' versions of songs, to give what he called 'greater continuity or higher dramatic interest'Study of Lloyd by E David Gregory. The liner notes to the second LP are often cited as a source of historical information about this song, though they do not appear to come within Wikipedia's definition of a \\"reliable source\\", having been compiled by Goldstein, who had had an education in business and was currently in the business of selling folk music via recorded musicSee, for example, the Wikipedia page on Goldstein. The version sung, and possibly devised, by Lloyd appears to be the earliest available variant using the title \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\" for which there is clear evidence. These liner notes are the main origin of an often repeated incorrect idea that an early version of the song was collected in Dublin, Ireland. In those notes Goldstein cites an article by Kenneth Lodewick as a sourceLodewick, K ‚ÄúThe Unfortunate Rake\\" and His Descendants. Western Folklore Vol. 14, No. 2 (Apr., 1955), pp. 98-109. In that article, Lodewick incorrectly substitutes 'Dublin' for 'Cork', which is the place of collection given in the source material he cites. That same source material is where A L Lloyd obtained the tune he uses on the LP. It is a collection of Irish tunes gathered by William Forde in Ireland, and published by P W Joyce, of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland in 1909. The tune in question is called \\"My Jewel, My Joy\\", and not \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\"Joyce, P W, (1909) \\"Old Irish Folk Music and Songs. A Collection of 842 Irish Airs and Songs Hitherto Unpublished\\", London, Longmans. . Lloyd's rationale for selecting this tune is outlined in the essay cited by Goldstein in the liner notes to the second LPLloyd, A L (1956) \\"Background to St James' Infirmary\\", Sing Magazine, Vol 3, pp19-21 . None of these versions, with the exception of the 1950s version by A L Lloyd, and the version collected in Virginia, includes the phrase \\"St James'\\", though some refer to a differently named hospital. Lyrics: In most variants the narrator is a friend or parent who meets the young man or woman who is dying; in other variants the narrator is the one dying. The 1960 Folkways Records album also titled \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\" features 20 different variations of the ballad. Variants not in this album include a number of nineteenth century broadsheet versions, including: *\\"The Buck's Elegy\\" *\\"The Unfortunate Lad\\"; printed for John Carrots; digital version published online by the National Library of Scotland; dated by that source as around 1850; opening line refers to \\"The Lock Hospital\\". * \\"The Unfortunate Lad\\"; printed by H P Such, London; digital version published online by the Bodleian; dated by that source as between 1863 and 1885; opening line refers to \\"The Lock Hospital\\". Very similar to the Carrots version, with different illustration and some other minor differences. The Folkways LP appears to claim that A L Lloyd is singing a nineteenth century broadsheet version, but does not specify which broadsheet version. It does, however, provide a reference to the 1956 article by A L Lloyd (Op Cit), which explicitly refers to the Such version. However, the words sung by Lloyd are not those in the Such broadside. Other variants not on the Folkways LP include: *\\"Only the Heartaches/Only the Hangman is Waiting For Me\\" -belonging to the cowboy branch of the family, the narrator contemplates murdering his lover and the consequences of such an act - recorded by Rex Allen *\\"Young Girl Cut Down in Her Prime\\" *\\"When I Was on Horseback\\" \\\\- recorded by Steeleye SpanWhen I Was on Horseback *\\"Dyin' Crapshooter's Blues\\"- This song bears a few similarities to the more famous \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\". Similarly chronicling an amoral life gone wrong, this song's most famous interpretation was done by Blind Willie McTell, but is based around crooked gambler Jesse Williams. McTell sings of a cold hearted gambler, who becomes distressed about a relationship with \\"Sweet Lorene\\", he comes into conflict with the police, and is shot down. Like in \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\", Williams wants \\"six crapshooters to be my pallbearers\\". Lyrical similarities signify that the song shares \\"The Unfortunate Rake\\" with \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\" as a common ancestor. A later song that draws on elements from the ballad is the Eric Bogle song No Man's Land. In 2016 a version of the song renamed to 'A Young Trooper Cut Down' was recorded on the album 'War Stories' by Harp and a monkey. This story tells of the use of the song as a piece of propaganda by the military warning on the dangers of syphilis during WW1. In 2018 the song was prominently featured in ‚ÄúThe Mortal Remains,‚Äù the final episode of the Coen Brothers ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs‚Äù under the title ‚ÄúThe Unfortunate Lad.‚Äù The song was performed acapella by the actor Brendan Gleeson.

His wife (Hunter) pushes him to visit Dr. Braden for advice, which Harry agrees to reluctantly. Over the next couple of sessions, Harry improves his social tactics and finally becomes a good acquaintance of Dr. Braden: most of their sessions take place in his cab during work. Harry even goes as far as inviting Dr. Braden to attend his son Johnny's (Koteas) wedding in a few days. Dr. Braden cannot figure out why Harry is bothered with such hallucinations and comes up with the most difficult theories; Dr. Bolger eventually advises him not to think so difficult. It is eventually found out that Harry is a normal guy who was behaving strangely due to toxic poison from the new carpeting in his cab. Dr. Braden's main focus is patient Jennifer Coles (McGillis), the daughter of a wealthy businessman Oliver (Vaughn) and his loyal but distant wife (Lange). Jennifer is a nymphomaniac who is sleeping with random strangers from the street, despite a serious relationship with struggling actor Rick (Evigan). Oliver disapproves of Rick, feeling as if he is only going after her wealth, and wishes for her to be with someone such as an old friend from Harvard, Paul Rogers (Cunningham). Jennifer is introduced to the married man, and sleeps with him in a hotel room the next day. Paul offers to meet up again, but Jennifer is not interested. Feeling as if she is not worthy of most men she meets, including Rick, and aware that she is destroying her health and personal life by sleeping with a lot of men, she agrees to see Dr. Braden. Initially, Jennifer uses her sexuality to test Dr. Braden, but he is unaffected by her seductive behavior. One day, she becomes emotional when Rick reveals that he has been offered a steady acting job in San Diego, and wants her to move with him to California; something she is not willing to do. Minutes later, she invites the delivery boy (Land) into her bed, though changes her mind as he kisses her. The delivery boy does not listen to her struggling, and rapes her. Rick finds Jennifer physically assaulted in their home, and she reveals that she has been unfaithful to him. Simultaneously, Dr. Braden finds out that Jennifer is acting out because she has been molested by someone as a child. He invites her parents to a session, but they are reluctant to work with Dr. Braden. Jennifer reveals that she was molested as a 9-year-old and confided in her parents, but they feared that the scandal might hurt their career and told Jennifer that she was lying. During the session, Oliver is unamused with Jennifer digging up the past and speaks of his intentions of putting her in a mental hospital. He eventually leaves the session prematurely, thereby abandoning his daughter. Mrs. Coles apologizes for everything that has happened in the past, and leaves as well. Jennifer bursts out in tears, but thanks Dr. Braden for having helped her with coming to terms with her past. Following a conversation with Dr. Braden, Rick agrees to give his relationship with Jennifer another try.

Mehta is a regular speaker at atheist events, and has been a board member of charitable organizations such as the Secular Student Alliance and the Foundation Beyond Belief. Mehta runs the Friendly Atheist blog on Patheos, in which he and his associates publish articles several times a day, and also co-hosts a weekly podcast called the Friendly Atheist Podcast. On April 1, 2020, Mehta won his first appearance on the television game show Jeopardy! Biography Mehta was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1983. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2004 with a double degree in math and biology and began teaching in 2007. He acquired a master's degree in math education from DePaul University in 2010 and a national board certification in teaching in 2012. He taught high school math at Neuqua Valley High School until 2014 when he announced on Facebook and his blog that he had submitted his resignation to the school, citing that \\"As much as I love being in the classroom, the opportunities online are just a lot greater right now, and I don‚Äôt want to have any regrets down the road about not taking this chance while I have it.\\" After his resignation, he stayed on as the head coach of the school's speech team. Mehta was raised in the Jain faith. He became an atheist as a teenager. Seeking to learn more about what motivated many Americans to be religious, he decided to attend and take notes at a number of churches across the United States. He based his choice of churches to attend on the results of an eBay auction in which he offered his bidders, ‚ÄùI am an atheist. You can bid on where I go to church or a temple or a mosque, etc.\\" Mehta's experiences at the churches became the basis for his book, I Sold My Soul on eBay. He is the father of two children. Activism Hemant Mehta established a secular student group, Students WithOut Religious Dogma (SWORD), at the University of Illinois at Chicago while earning dual degrees there. Later, still in college, he served as board chair for the Secular Student Alliance. He interned at the Center for Inquiry where he became familiar with a lot of the national organizations and leaders in the activist world at that time. Now, he serves on the board of directors for the Foundation Beyond Belief, a non-profit charitable organization. Hemant Mehta at Skepticon in 2014 Mehta is a regular speaker at freethought and skeptical events around the U.S. He attempts to build bridges of understanding between believers and non- believers through his blog, The Friendly Atheist. Due in part to his positive message, he is also invited to speak at atheist events such as the one he presented at The Reason Rally or at the American Atheists Annual Convention in March 2012. A vocal advocate of building an atheist community, Mehta's activism includes fundraising for charitable causes. He helped establish and serves on the board of the Foundation Beyond Belief, which has raised more than $2,400,000 since it launched in 2010. He also established a church cleanup fund in response to reports of church vandalism in Bend, Oregon, in 2012. The vandals tagged the church with allusions to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and Mehta's readers contributed nearly $3,000 in one day to help clean up the damage. Mehta writes for the \\"On Faith\\" column in the Washington Post and has been featured in a New York Times debate on prayer. When asked about his beliefs his response is clear: \\"Simply put, I have never seen any evidence of 'God's work' in action. I've seen what people think is God's work, but which actually has perfectly natural explanations. I believe that most people are good, even when nobody's looking. I believe our best path to discovering the truth lies in science, not religion.\\" Hemant Mehta presents scholarship cheque to Jessica Ahlquist at Reason Rally In June 2013 Mehta wrote for the \\"Room for Debate\\" series in the New York Times, where he argued that \\"There‚Äôs a very real downside to praying. It lulls believers into a false sense of accomplishment.\\" In July 2013 he held an open discussion at the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he explained his frustration at being confronted time and again with the same arguments for believing in God. He also commented that \\"Many Christians had negative stereotypes about atheists that prevented fruitful conversation.\\" Mehta was a guest on CNN on August 20, 2013 to discuss the rise of atheism among the millennial generation. Also in 2013 he began publishing \\"The Atheist Voice\\" series of video discussions on YouTube, which had over 215 thousant subscribers in 2020. He started a second channel, Friendly Atheist, in 2019, on which he currently has 29 thousand subscribers. With Jerry Coyne and Richard Dawkins at \\"An Appetite for Wonder - An Evening with Richard Dawkins October 3, 2013. Evanston, Illinois, USA Mehta is the co-host, with Jessica Bluemke, of a weekly podcast named the Friendly Atheist Podcast, which has produced over 270 episodes as of June 2019. Published works In January 2006, Mehta posted an auction on eBay where he explained his background in atheism and offered to go to the worship services of the winning bidder's choosing. The auction ended on February 3, 2006 with a final bid of $504 from Jim Henderson, a minister from Seattle, Washington. Mehta later donated that money to the Secular Student Alliance, a non-profit organization for which he served as chair of the board of directors. Nearly a month after the auction, an article about Mehta's experiences appeared on the front page of The Wall Street Journal,. He was featured in the Chicago Sun-Times, the Seattle Times, and the Village Voice, and on National Public Radio. Henderson asked Mehta to visit a variety of churches and write about the experiences on Henderson's website, offthemap.com. Mehta eventually wrote about his visits at nine different churches as well as two additional pieces dealing with atheist conventions and Christian media. I Sold My Soul on eBay contains Mehta's observations and critiques of the churches along with background on how he became an atheist. Other published works include The Young Atheist's Survival Guide published in 2012 and The Friendly Atheist: Thoughts on the Role of Religion in Politics and Media published in 2013. The former is aimed at students, teachers, and parents who may face ostracism due to their lack of religious belief. The latter is intended as a study guide for the many things written by Mehta. In August 2014, Mehta announced his latest project, God is an Abusive Boyfriend (and you should break up), based on his YouTube series, The Atheist Voice. However, Mehta cancelled the project after receiving negative feedback from his readers.

It is in the deanery of Farnham, the archdeaconry of Surrey and the Diocese of Guildford. The church was consecrated in 1840 and is a Grade II listed building. History=Church= In 1820 Wrecclesham was seen as a village of not having the best of reputations. The situation so disgusted an Australian who had come to live in Farnham that he wrote to a publication, The Speaker, as follows: There is one licence to every 126 inhabitants (in Farnham), with the result that during the eight months I have been in the district I have seen more drunk people than during the previous 12 years in Adelaide, with a population more than ten times as large. It is very necessary that something be done to lessen the evil, which is even worse in the surrounding villages. About two miles from here is a village called Wreekelsham (sic), with a population of 600, and in its main street there are five licensed houses within 200 yards, besides another in a side street, and several grocer's licences. On Monday afternoons the whole village is drunk, and one has to drive through it very carefully.Collyer, Graham, The Surrey Village Book (Countryside Books, 1998), p. 240 The Bishop of Winchester, who lived at the nearby Farnham Castle, after hearing about Wrecclesham, decided to build a church to 'bring the worship of God into the village'. A collection to fund the church was begun and after raising ¬£1000 the building work started. The new church was consecrated on 16 July 1840 by the Bishop of Winchester, Charles Sumner. It was a small building consisting of a chancel, nave and north transept. The first vicar of the parish was Rev. R. D. Buttermer, who has a street in Wrecclesham named after him, Buttermer Close.Church History from St Peter's Wrecclesham, accessed 2 February 2013 Over the next few decades the size of the church steadily increased. In 1861, the church was enlarged with the chancel rebuilt and the south aisle added. In 1876, the nave was rebuilt with the north aisle added. In 1890, Rev. Charles Keable (d. 1923) became vicar of the parish. He served the parish for 33 years and after his death a street in Wrecclesham was also named after him, Keable Road. The organ was originally from St James' Church, formerly in east Farnham. It was moved to St Peter's in 1975, when St James' was converted into apartments. A new organ was bought in 1996 to replace that one and was installed in June 2001.Know your church from St Peter's Wrecclesham, accessed 2 February 2013 =Parish= The attempt to improve the social welfare of the village did not stop at only building the church. Beginning from the church, various other buildings and works were started. In 1860, St. Peter's School was opened. From the school, the Wrecclesham choir was created. The Wrecclesham Institute was made soon afterwards. It is opposite the church on the other side of School Hill. The institute was a licensed establishment that also created many sports and social organisations for the local population and was a founding team of Wrecclesham Cricket Club.Pinn, Stephen Cricket in Wrecclesham: A Brief History pp.6-11 Also, the Knights Almshouse was built down the hill from the church, along the Street, Wrecclesham. The parish hall, which is next door to the church, is named Leverton Hall after Rev. Charles Leverton (d. 1973), and was added in the early 1970s when the village hall was demolished.

It was first formalised by the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1991. Ho Chi Minh Thought is a broad term for political theories and policies that are seen by their proponents as representing Marxism‚ÄìLeninism adapted to Vietnamese circumstances and specific time periods. The ideology includes views on the basic issues of the Vietnamese Revolution, specifically the application and development of Marxism-Leninism to the material conditions of Vietnam. The contents of Ho Chi Minh Thought was codified and developed by the Communist Party of Vietnam. The Communist Party of Vietnam defines Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought as a guideline for all actions and victories of the Vietnamese revolution.ƒê·∫£ng C·ªông s·∫£n Vi·ªát Nam x√°c ƒë·ªãnh l·∫•y Ch·ªß nghƒ©a M√°c-L√™nin v√† t∆∞ t∆∞·ªüng H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh l√† kim ch·ªâ nam cho m·ªçi h√†nh ƒë·ªông v√† th·∫Øng l·ª£i c·ªßa c√°ch m·∫°ng Vi·ªát Nam.Ch·ªß nghƒ©a M√°c ‚Äì L√™nin v√† t∆∞ t∆∞·ªüng H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh l√† kim ch·ªâ nam cho m·ªçi h√†nh ƒë·ªông v√† th·∫Øng l·ª£i c·ªßa c√°ch m·∫°ng Vi·ªát Nam, Tr·∫ßn Vi·∫øt D∆∞∆°ng, Tr∆∞·ªùng Ch√≠nh tr·ªã t·ªânh Vƒ©nh Ph√∫c Ho Chi Minh Thought, while named after the Vietnamese revolutionary and President, does not necessarily reflect the ideology of Ho Chi Minh, rather Ho Chi Minh Thought refers to the official ideology of the Communist Party of Vietnam.  Origins  Ho Chi Minh Thought was influenced by Vietnamese culture, the French revolution, and Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Similar to Maoism, at the core of Ho Chi Minh Thought is that the peasantry is the revolutionary vanguard in pre-industrial societies, rather than the proletariat.H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh To√†n t·∫≠p, t·∫≠p 3, Nh√† xu·∫•t b·∫£n Ch√≠nh tr·ªã Qu·ªëc gia, trang 3. Ho Chi Minh Thought is rooted in: *Marxism-Leninism *Traditional Vietnamese ideology and culture *Eastern cultural thought: Confucianism, Buddhism *Western ideologies, specifically French and American political philosophy *Ho Chi Minh 's personal morality = Influence of Confucianism = Ho Chi Minh, the son of a Confucian scholar, studied Confucianism throughout his life and was a strong critic of Confucian ethics and ideals. Despite this public criticism, scholars have argued that Confucianism remains part of both the personal ideology of Ho Chi Minh, and within Ho Chi Minh Thought, arguing that Confucian morality and the principle of self-cultivation are a central part of the party's platform and the ideology of Ho Chi Minh Thought. The Communist Party rejects this, arguing that this proposition is a distortion of the historical record of both Ho Chi Minh and the Communist Party of Vietnam. Summarizing 30 years of studying Confucianism, Ho Chi Minh concluded: > H·ªçc thuy·∫øt c·ªßa Kh·ªïng T·ª≠ c√≥ ∆∞u ƒëi·ªÉm c·ªßa n√≥ l√† s·ª± tu d∆∞·ª°ng ƒë·∫°o ƒë·ª©c c√° nh√¢n. > T√¥n gi√°o Gi√™su c√≥ ∆∞u ƒëi·ªÉm c·ªßa n√≥ l√† l√≤ng nh√¢n √°i cao c·∫£.

Ideology  Ho Chi Minh Thought, as codified by the Communist Party of Vietnam, describes the following as the core of ideological system of Ho Chi Minh Thought: VƒÉn ki·ªán ƒê·∫°i h·ªôi ƒë·∫°i bi·ªÉu to√†n qu·ªëc l·∫ßn th·ª© IX, Nh√† xu·∫•t b·∫£n.Document of the 9th National Congress, Publishing House.

Ho Chi Minh Thought argues that revolutionary violence and humanitarian peace are dialectical opposed to each other, however the synthesis of their conflict would inevitably be the preservation of peace, independence and national liberation.Curriculum Ho Chi Minh ideology. National political publishing house. Second edition, 2006, pages 48, 29, 50 Related to socialism and economics, Ho Chi Minh Thought details the following about socialist construction and characteristics of a socialist society and economy: *Socialism is a society with highly developed production force, associated with the progressive development of science - technology and culture, the rich, and the strong country. *Implementation of workers ownership of the means of production and implementing the principle of labor distribution. * A dictatorship of the proletariat based on the unity of industrial, agricultural, and intellectual workers under the leadership of the Communist Party. * A socialist society has a system of social relations that is healthy, fair and equal, with no opposition between intellectual and manual labor, and between urban and rural areas. Ho Chi Minh Thought emphasizes a gradual transition to socialism. Similar to Socialism with Chinese Characteristics, Ho Chi Minh Thought places emphasis on the role of the development of the productive forces towards the development of socialism. According to Ho Chi Minh, when entering the period of transition to socialism, the Vietnamese economy was described as a largely outdated agricultural economy that had not yet underwent capitalist development. In particular, Ho Chi Minh paid special attention to the fundamental contradiction of the transition period, which is the conflict between the country's high development needs and the socio-economic situation of the working class. Ho Chi Minh Thought also stresses learning from the experiences of other socialist countries in building Socialism and make use of all the help of international aid and cooperation.Ho Chi Minh: Complete, National Political Publishing House, Hanoi, 2000, volume 7, p. 249, quoted \\" The Soviet Union is advancing towards communism. China and Eastern European countries are fast quickly implement socialism, The countries you lead lead us to experience and support us We have the determination: determination to study, determination to resist, determination to work, determination to overcome. all difficulties, we will definitely win. \\" While H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh supported the position that Vietnam had entered the stage of transition to socialism in 1954, he held the belief that Vietnam was still \\"a democratic regime in which people are the masters\\" and not socialist. To reach the socialist stage of development, the development of the state sector was of utmost importance‚Äîthe lack of which according to H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh would lead to failure. The platform of the 11th National Congress held in January 2011 stated: \\"This is a profound and thorough revolutionary process and a complicated struggle between the old and the new for qualitative changes in all aspects of social life. It is essential to undergo a long period of transition with several steps of development and several mixed social and economic structures\\". A propaganda poster promoting the study of Ho Chi Minh morality. According to the party's General Secretary Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng, during the transition to socialism, socialist factors of development compete with non-socialist factors, which include capitalist factors. Nguy·ªÖn said: \\"Along with positive aspects, there will always be negative aspects and challenges that need to be considered wisely and dealt with timely and effectively. It is a difficult struggle that requires spirit, fresh vision, and creativity. The path to socialism is a process of constantly consolidating and strengthening socialist factors to make them more dominant and irreversible. Success will depend on correct policies, political spirit, leadership capacity, and the fighting strength of the Party\\".  Morality  A unique aspect of Ho Chi Minh thought is the emphasis on personal morality and ethics. The personal values of Ho Chi Minh are regularly upheld by the Party, and party members are taught to exemplify Ho Chi Minh's personal values: practicing the standard of industriousness, thrift, integrity, uprightness, public-spiritedness and selflessness in serving the country and the people. Central to Ho Chi Minh morality is living a modest and immaterial lifestyle, and devoting oneself to the collective good and the advancement of socialism and self-determination. Ho Chi Minh wrote about morality throughout his entire life, and often criticized individualism, such as in his short essay Raise up Revolutionary Ethics, Eliminate Individuals. The personal values of Ho Chi Minh are a mandatory party of school curriculum throughout Vietnam.  Development  At the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam held in Hanoi in 1991, it was determined that Marxism - Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought were the basis of the ideology of the Party. Since this congress, Ho Chi Minh Thought has been taught in all universities as a compulsory subject for all students of all disciplines. The formal training - and discussion between experts - for this course began in 1997 at Hanoi University.C∆∞∆°ng lƒ©nh x√¢y d·ª±ng ƒë·∫•t n∆∞·ªõc trong th·ªùi k√¨ qu√° ƒë·ªô l√™n Ch·ªß nghƒ©a X√£ h·ªôi, ƒê·∫£ng C·ªông s·∫£n Vi·ªát Nam.
