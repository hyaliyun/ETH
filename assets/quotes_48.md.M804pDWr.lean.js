As the Lancastrian position weakened, Lewis found his own fortunes and even personal safety becoming precarious. Although the city of Rouen did not fall to Charles VII of France until late 1449, well after Luxembourg's death, King Henry's government had long ago decided the archbishop needed and deserved remuneration and status based more securely in England.

He served as Chancellor of Oxford University and as Bishop of Ely.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 245 Family Grey was the son of Sir Thomas Grey, one of the conspirators in the Southampton Plot, and Alice Neville, the daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his first wife Margaret (d.1396), daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford.; . He had three brothers, and four or five sisters, including:. *Sir Thomas Grey (1404 ‚Äì d. before 1426), who in 1412, at eight years of age, was betrothed to Isabel, then three years of age, only daughter of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge,. and Anne Mortimer, but died childless. *Sir Ralph Grey (d. 17 March 1442), who married Elizabeth FitzHugh, daughter of Henry FitzHugh, 3rd Baron FitzHugh, and Elizabeth Grey, and left children.; . *Sir John Grey.. *a sister who married a husband surnamed Arundel.. *Joan Grey (c. 1408‚Äì1488), who married Sir John Salvin.. *Elizabeth Grey (c. 1402‚Äì1454), who married firstly, Sir William Whitchester, and secondly, Sir Roger Widdrington.. Studies in England Grey was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, and in due course became a Doctor of Divinity at Oxford University. His powerful family connections early secured him ecclesiastical preferment. On 11 January 1430‚Äì1 he was collated to the prebend of Kentish Town in the Diocese of London, an office which he held until 1446. On 16 May 1434 he was made archdeacon of Northampton, and in the same year prebendary of Thame in the Diocese of London; these preferments he occupied until 1454. On 21 October 1443, he was collated to the prebend of Longdon in the Diocese of Lichfield. Towards the end of 1447 he is mentioned as prebendary of Barnby, and then for a short time in the latter part of 1452 of Driffield, both in the Diocese of York. Before this last date, on 3 March 1449‚Äì50, he was admitted archdeacon of Richmond.Jones Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1300-1541: volume 6: Northern province (York, Carlisle and Durham): Archdeacons: Richmond How far these various and accumulated preferments imply a residence in England may be doubtful, but that Grey lived for some time in Oxford, possibly with the object of completing the acts required for the degree of Doctor of Divinity, is shown by the facts that he was elected Chancellor of the University, and held that office in 1440-1 and also during a part of 1442, and that later in this year he acted for a time as commissary. Probably his long sojourn abroad may be placed partly before 1440 and mostly after 1442. Studies abroad Grey's travels led him first to Cologne, where he studied logic, philosophy, and theology. He lived there in princely style and with a magnificent household, for some years. Then, possibly after an interval spent in England, he went to Italy in order to apply himself more closely to the study of classical learning. He stayed for a while in Florence and then removed to Padua. Afterwards, being advised to profit by the teaching of the famous Guarino da Verona, he settled in Ferrara. Here, too, he kept a splendid establishment, and maintained Niccol√≤ Perotti, afterwards well known as a grammarian, in his household, probably about 1477‚Äì8. Perotti was a mere youth, but his Greek scholarship made his help valuable to the Englishman. Grey remained at Ferrara until 1449, when Henry VI appointed him his proctor at the Roman curia. He took Perotti with him and afterwards procured him a post in the household of Cardinal Bessarion. Bishop of Ely Grey's devotion to humanism and his patronage of learned men naturally found favour in the eyes of Pope Nicholas V. As early as 1450 the latter sought to obtain for him the bishopric of Lincoln, and failing to accomplish this, on 21 June 1454, on the elevation of Bishop Bourchier to the see of Canterbury, nominated him to the vacant bishopric of Ely. In the bull of provision Grey is described as apostolic notary and referendary. The temporalities were restored to him on 6 September, and he was consecrated by the new archbishop at Mortlake two days later. But he was not installed in his cathedral until St Cuthbert's Day, 20 March 1457‚Äì8, when there was a great frost. Contributions to Balliol College Library Grey devoted much care to the collection of manuscripts, and wherever he resided constantly employed scribes to make copies of such books as he could not otherwise obtain. Many of these he had adorned with costly miniatures and initial letters by the skill of an artist who worked for him at Florence. It was his desire to make his collection the nucleus of a library for Balliol College, Oxford, to the building of which, as well as to that of the master's lodgings and of the old buttery and hall, he contributed largely. The work was finished about 1477 by Robert Abdy, then master of the college, and enriched with some two hundred manuscripts, the bishop's gift. Of these, many were destroyed in the reign of Edward VI and during the English Civil War, and by Wood's time few of the miniatures in the remaining volumes had escaped mutilation. But by 1890, no less than 152 of Grey's codices were still in the possession of the college, and form a large part of Roger Mynors' 1963 catalogue of the college's manuscripts. The bishop's coat of arms (gules, a lion rampant, within a bordure engrailed argent) is displayed on two windows of the Old Library, and in the panels below the window of the Master's dining room. Mediator during the Wars of the Roses During the troubled years of his episcopate Grey never took a leading part in public affairs. He devoted himself rather to the charge of his diocese, and still more probably to his learned interests, which were reputed to extend not only to Greek but also to Hebrew, while in his palace on Holborn he maintained the same stately establishment as that for which he had been famous on the continent. Yet there is ample evidence also of his political activity. In the beginning of 1455, he was appointed to serve on a commission to arbitrate between the Duke of York and the Duke of Somerset, the failure of which was shown in the first battle of St. Albans in the following May. Later on, apparently in 1460, before the battle of Northampton, he again took part in an attempted reconciliation of the Yorkist leaders. At length, on 25 October 1469, he was made Lord High Treasurer, and held the seals until the following July. Grey's tenure as Lord High Treasurer occurred during the Great Bullion Famine and the Great Slump in England. On 26 August 1471 he was named first on a commission of fifteen to hold a diet at Alnwick to deal with the infractions of the truce with Scotland, and in the following March to treat with the Scots ambassadors at Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 25 April, and again on 16 May he was entrusted with a similar negotiation. In February 1477‚Äì8, Grey's health showed signs of breaking down. After Easter, he quit his London palace for Ely, and then, as his weakness increased, he removed to his neighbouring manor of Downham. Here he died on Tuesday, 4 August 1478. On the next day his body was borne to Ely with great pomp, attended by almost all the priests of the Isle, and on that Thursday the bishop was buried between two marble pillars on the north side of Ely Cathedral, the fabric of which owes not a little to his munificence.

The second vessel of that type built in Germany, Prinz Heinrich was constructed at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel, being laid down in December 1898, launched in March 1900, and commissioned in March 1902. Prinz Heinrichs design was a modification of the previous armored cruiser, , and traded a smaller main battery and thinner armor for higher speed. All subsequent German armored cruisers were incremental developments of Prinz Heinrich. Prinz Heinrich served with the German fleet in home waters for just four years, from 1902 to 1906, when she was withdrawn from front-line service. During this period, she served as the flagship of the fleet's scouting forces, and she was primarily occupied with fleet training. The ship was out of service from early 1906 to mid-1908, when she was reactivated for use as a gunnery training ship, a role she filled until late 1912. Prinz Heinrich underwent modernization and conversion into a dedicated training ship in 1914, and the work was completed just before the outbreak of World War I in July that year. After the outbreak of war, the ship was reactivated for active service, initially with III Scouting Group with the High Seas Fleet. Prinz Heinrich was used for coastal defense in the North Sea and she participated in the fleet sortie that supported the Raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in December 1914. After the naval command determined that Prinz Heinrich was too old to serve in the North Sea against the powerful British Royal Navy, she was transferred to the Baltic Sea in early 1915. She supported offensive minelaying operations and patrolled the central Baltic for Russian forces, but never encountered hostile forces. She provided gunfire support during the attack on Libau in May 1915 and shelled Russian positions during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August. In the face of severe crew shortages in late 1915, Prinz Heinrich had her crew reduced and was ultimately decommissioned and disarmed in March 1916. She thereafter served in a variety of secondary roles for the rest of the war, before being broken up in 1920. Design , Germany's first armored cruiser; note the heavy military masts and dispersed secondary battery guns, both not repeated for Prinz Heinrich Prinz Heinrich, the second armored cruiser built in Germany, was authorized under the 1898 Naval Law, the first naval construction program begun under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Naval Office). The design for Prinz Heinrich was prepared in the late 1890s while construction of the first vessel, , was still underway. Some older naval historians, including Hugh Lyon and John Taylor, writing in 1979 and 1969, respectively, have stated that Prinz Heinrich was intended for overseas service, but Aidan Dodson points out that the ship's hull was not sheathed with wood and copper or zinc layers, which would have been necessary for any ship deployed overseas where shipyard facilities would not be readily available. Dodson also noted that the ship never actually went abroad on an extended deployment. The design staff based the new vessel on the basic design of F√ºrst Bismarck, but for budgetary reasons the new ship's size was reduced by about . Weight reduction was achieved in part by thinning the ship's armor layout, though advances in steel technology meant this was not actually a compromise and her armor layout was in fact significantly more effective than F√ºrst Bismarcks. Krupp had recently developed cemented armor plate, which was considerably stronger than earlier Harvey armor, so less of it could be used to achieve the same level of protection. In addition, the belt could be made taller, extending up to the main deck level, which protected more of the ship's interior. The ship's deck armor sloped down on the sides, where it was connected to the lower edge of the belt, which considerably strengthened the protection system by providing another layer of armor that would need to be penetrated before the ship's vitals could be damaged. The armament was also significantly reduced to save weight and cost, from four heavy guns in two twin-gun turrets to two guns, each in single turrets; she also received two fewer secondary guns compared to F√ºrst Bismarck. But rather than spreading the secondary battery along the length of the hull in casemates and sponsons, they were concentrated in a battery amidships, which reduced the amount of the hull that needed to be protected with armor, further saving weight and allowing thicker armor to be concentrated in the battery. Further weight savings were achieved by adopting a smaller superstructure and discarding heavy military masts in favor of lighter pole masts. Her engines, however, were some more powerful, which produced a faster vessel. The ship proved to be an influential design, and all subsequent German armored cruisers were developments of Prinz Heinrich. In fact, the armor layout pioneered in Prinz Heinrich provided the basis of all German capital ships designed over the next forty years, including the final battleships of the and H-classes. Nevertheless, she was not without critics; Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) Albert Hopman referred to the ship as \\"cheap, but bad\\" in his memoirs Logbuch eines Seeoffiziers (Log of a Sea Officer). The naval historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert R√∂hr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz regard Hopman's criticism as an exaggeration, pointing out that Prinz Heinrich compared well to foreign contemporaries like the French , the Russian , and the Italian , though she was inferior to British designs. She nevertheless spent only four years in active service in peacetime before being replaced with newer, more powerful cruisers. Dimensions and machinery Line- drawing of Prinz Heinrich Prinz Heinrich was long at the waterline and overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. The ship displaced as built, and at full load. The hull was constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and incorporated thirteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 57 percent of the length of the ship. The German navy considered the ship to be a good sea boat with gentle motion, though she suffered from severe roll. Her transverse metacentric height was . Prinz Heinrich was manned by a crew of 35 officers and 532 enlisted men. For the duration of her career as the second command flagship of the Cruiser Division, the standard crew was augmented by an additional nine officers and 44 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller vessels, including two picket boats, a launch, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ship was propelled by three vertical 4-cylinder triple expansion engines; the center shaft drove a four-bladed screw in diameter while the two outer shafts drove wide four-bladed screws. Fourteen D√ºrr water-tube boilers, produced by D√ºsseldorf-Ratinger R√∂hrenkesselfabrik, supplied steam to the engines at pressures up to . The boilers were ducted into two funnels amidships. The propulsion system was rated at and gave the ship a top speed of , though on sea trials, Prinz Heinrichs engines reached but a top speed of only . She was designed to carry of coal, though additional storage allowed up to . This enabled a maximum range of at a speed of and at a cruising speed of . Armament Prinz Heinrich in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, passing the Levensau High Bridge Prinz Heinrich was armed with a variety of weapons. Her primary armament consisted of two SK L/40 quick-firing guns mounted in single turrets, one on either end of the superstructure. These guns were supplied with 75 rounds each; they could depress to ‚àí4¬∞ and elevate to 30¬∞, which enabled a maximum range of . The guns fired a round at a muzzle velocity of per second. A secondary battery of ten SK L/40 quick-firing guns rounded out her offensive armament. Six of these guns were mounted in amidships casemates on either side of the vessel, and the remaining four were mounted in turrets in the ship's hull above the casemates. These guns were supplied with 120 rounds each. The shells weighed and were fired at a muzzle velocity of per second. The guns could elevate to 25¬∞ for a maximum range of . The cruiser carried ten SK L/30 quick-firing guns for defense against torpedo boats. Each of these guns was supplied with 250 shells. The shells weighed and were fired at a muzzle velocity of per second. This enabled a maximum range of at an elevation of 20¬∞. The ship's gun armament was rounded out by four autocannons, though these were subsequently removed. The ship was also fitted with four torpedo tubes. One was mounted on the stern in a swivel mount, one was mounted submerged in the bow, and one was placed submerged in the hull on either side abreast of the forward gun turret. Armor Prinz Heinrich was protected by Krupp armor. Her armor belt was thick in the central portion of the ship, which protected the ammunition magazines, machinery spaces, and other vital areas of the cruiser. The belt was reduced to on either end of the main belt, and the bow and stern were unarmored. The entire length of the belt was backed by equal thicknesses of teak planks. The armored deck was thick and was connected to the belt by thick sloped armor on the broadside. The forward conning tower had thick sides and a thick roof. The aft conning tower was much less thoroughly protected; it was covered by only of steel plating. The main battery gun turrets had 150 mm-thick sides and 30 mm-thick roofs. The 15 cm gun turrets had 100 mm-thick armor, while the casemated weapons were protected by gun shields. The casemates themselves were armored with 100 mm worth of steel plating. Service history Peacetime career left Prinz Heinrich was laid down on 1 December 1898 at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel. She was launched on 22 March 1900; the ship's namesake, Prince Heinrich of Prussia, was present at the ceremony, and the Generalinspekteur der Marine (General Inspector of the Navy), Admiral Hans von Koester, gave a speech. The ship was completed just under two years later, on 11 March 1902. She then began sea trials that lasted until June, at which point she joined the reconnaissance forces attached to I Squadron. She took part in the training activities in the squadron, including a training cruise in Norwegian waters from 8 to 20 July. In August, she escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II aboard his yacht Hohenzollern during a trip to meet Czar Nicholas II of Russia in Reval. Prinz Heinrich next took part in fleet training in August and September, where she served as the flagship of II Scouting Group, with included the light cruisers and . After the conclusion of the maneuvers on 18 September, the pre- dreadnought battleship was decommissioned for maintenance; the ship had been serving as the flagship of Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Curt von Prittwitz und Gaffron, the deputy commander of the squadron. While the ship was out of service, Prittwitz und Gaffron transferred to Prinz Heinrich, though he remained there only briefly before he was replaced by KAdm Ludwig Borckenhagen on 1 October. Prinz Heinrich and the rest of the squadron ended the year with a winter training cruise, during which she tried to pull the new battleship free on 17 December after she ran aground in the Great Belt. The 1900 Naval Law created the position of Commander of Scouting Forces, and Borckenhagen became the first person to fill the role. He therefore remained aboard Prinz Heinrich, which became the flagship of the Reconnaissance Force on 1 March 1903. Prinz Heinrich, the protected cruiser , and the light cruisers and conducted training maneuvers beginning in April. On 12 April, they were joined by the light cruiser ; by 2 May they had also been joined by the light cruisers and Niobe. The ships took part in the autumn fleet maneuvers in August and September, after which Borckenhagen was replaced by KAdm Gustav Schmidt. Prinz Heinrich participated in the fleet training activities of 1903, which included a visit to Spain from 7 May to 10 August. During the cruise, she stayed in Vigo, Spain from 20 to 30 May. After returning to Germany, the fleet then conducted its annual training exercises, which concluded on 22 September. On 25 January 1904, Prinz Heinrich went to help the Norwegian town of √Ölesund in the aftermath of a fire that had caused extensive destruction. In mid-1904, the new armored cruiser joined the Reconnaissance Force. The typical autumn maneuvers took place in August and September, during which Prinz Heinrich won the Kaiser's Schiesspreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent accuracy for large cruisers. On 3 December, Schmidt transferred his flag to Friedrich Carl. collier Hermann Sauber The year 1905 passed without incident, following the same routine as previous years. From 11 March to 20 June, Prinz Heinrich again served as Schmidt's flagship, as Friedrich Carl was occupied with escorting Hohenzollern on a trip abroad. In early July, Prinz Heinrich experimented with a new coaling apparatus; further tests were made with it in November and February 1906. She visited Uddevalla and S√∂dert√§lje in Sweden in mid-1905. She had another stint as flagship from 10 to 26 August while Friedrich Carl was in dry dock for maintenance. On 1 October, the position of Deputy Commander of Scouting Forces was created, and Prinz Heinrichs commander, Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Raimund Winkler became the first to fill the role. In March 1906, the ship was removed from the reconnaissance forces, her place having been taken by Friedrich Carl, which had in turn been replaced by the new armored cruiser . By this time, Prinz Heinrich had spent just four years on active service with the fleet. Prinz Heinrich spent two years in reserve when she was reactivated on 15 May 1908 to replace the old gunnery training ship . She went to Sonderburg on 22 June, where the Naval Artillery Inspectorate was located. Over the next four years, Prinz Heinrich largely remained in port where she trained gunners for the fleet until she was replaced by the armored cruiser in October 1912. Prinz Heinrich was decommissioned again on 31 October; a year later, in November 1913, the Reichsmarineamt began exploring the possibility of converting the ship into a dedicated training vessel, and the naval command decided that it should still be possible to use the vessel as a warship in the event of an emergency. In early 1914, Prinz Heinrich went into dry dock at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel for the conversion. The arrangement of the searchlights was modified, the superstructure deck bulwark was removed, and the masts were modernized. Conversion work was completed just before the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. World War I Prinz Heinrich passing through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal Following the wave of declarations of war between the major European powers at the end of July and early August, Britain declared war on Germany on 5 August. Prinz Heinrich was reactivated for wartime service the same day, and she then went into the shipyard in Kiel for preparation work. She was then assigned to the defenses of the port in advance of an expected British attack on Kiel on 25‚Äì26 September. When that failed to materialize, Prinz Heinrich was assigned to III Scouting Group, part of the High Seas Fleet. From 8 November to 14 April 1915, Prinz Heinrich was primarily occupied with guard duty in the Jade Bay and the river Ems. During this period, she participated in the second major German offensive in the North Sea, the operation to bombard Hartlepool on 15‚Äì16 December 1914. Prinz Heinrich, along with and a flotilla of torpedo boats, was assigned to the van of the High Seas Fleet, commanded by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl. The main fleet was providing distant cover to Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers, which were conducting the bombardment. During the night of the 15th, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre- dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany. After the operation, it was determined that the twelve-year-old Prinz Heinrich had no place in operations against the powerful British Grand Fleet. Accordingly, on 12 April 1915, III Scouting Group was detached from the High Seas Fleet and the ships were transferred to the Baltic Sea to operate against the Russian Baltic Fleet. On 15 April, the ships arrived in Kiel, where they came under command of then-KAdm Hopman, the commander of scouting forces in the Baltic. Hopman was then in the process of planning a major attack on Libau in conjunction with an attempt by the German Army to seize the city. The attack took place on 7 May, and consisted of Prinz Heinrich, Roon, and Prinz Adalbert, the elderly coast defense ship , and the light cruisers , , and . They were escorted by a number of destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers. The IV Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet was detached from the North Sea to provide cover for the operation. The bombardment went as planned, though the destroyer struck a mine in Libau's harbor, which blew off her bow and destroyed the ship. German ground forces were successful in their assault however, and took the city. Prinz Heinrich steaming at high speed Prinz Heinrich supported a minelaying operation off the coast of Finland over the course of 23‚Äì26 May. From 3 to 5 June, Prinz Heinrich participated in a sortie into the Gulf of Finland. She supported another minelaying operation from 20 to 23 June. On 1 July, the minelayer , escorted by the cruisers Roon, Augsburg, and L√ºbeck and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of Bogsk√§r. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; Augsburg, Albatross, and three destroyers made for Rixh√∂ft while the remainder of the unit went to Libau. Augsburg and Albatross were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers. Commodore Johannes von Karpf, the flotilla commander, ordered the slower Albatross to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and L√ºbeck. Albatross was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with Prinz Heinrich and Prinz Adalbert to support Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert. Hopman broke off the operation and returned to port with the damaged cruiser. From 11 to 12 July, Prinz Heinrich participated in a sortie toward Gotska Sand√∂n, though the Germans failed to locate any Russian warships. Another sweep into the central Baltic, between Libau and Gotland, took place on 1 to 2 August that again did not result in combat. German naval forces in the Baltic were reinforced by elements of the High Seas Fleet during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in early August 1915. The Germans sought to drive out the Russians in the Gulf of Riga and to lay defensive minefields that would prevent a Russian counterattack. The battleships of the I Battle Squadron were the primary force, though Prinz Heinrich and the rest of the older vessels assigned to the Baltic fleet participated. On 10 August, Prinz Heinrich and Roon bombarded Russian defenses at Zerel, on the southernmost tip of the Sworbe Peninsula on the island of √ñsel. Several Russian destroyers were anchored off Zerel, and were caught unawares by the German bombardment. Prinz Heinrich and Roon damaged one of the destroyers during their attack. A combination of tenacious Russian defense and reports of British submarines in the area‚Äîproved by the torpedoing of the battlecruiser on 19 August‚Äîcaused the German navy to break off the operation. In the meantime, Prinz Heinrichs boiler tubes were in need of replacement, so she was detached for repairs at Kiel, where she arrived on 11 August. Repairs were completed the following month, and she arrived back in Libau on 22 September. She took part in another minelaying sortie into the Baltic in the direction of √ñstergarn on 5‚Äì6 October. By this time, the German navy had begun to experience severe crew shortages, and so the Reichsmarineamt decided to decommission older, less combat-capable vessels. On 10 November, Prinz Heinrich left Libau for Kiel, where she arrived the following day. Her crew was reduced and she was assigned to the \\"Readiness Division\\" with Wittelsbach, and she remained there until 27 March 1916, when she was decommissioned and disarmed. For the rest of the war, she served as a floating headquarters for Prince Heinrich, the commander in chief of naval forces in the Baltic. She was also used as a barracks ship and a tender. Beginning in 1918, she was also used to support the U-Kreuzer Flotilla. She was stricken from the naval register on 25 January 1920 and sold later that year. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap at Audorf- Rendsburg.

The work is his second in the trilogy on the Trobrianders, with the other two being Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922) and Coral Gardens and Their Magic (1935). Summary In the preface Malinowski says that sexuality \\"dominates in fact almost every aspect of culture\\".Malinowski 29, p. xxiiiHerdt, Gilbert H. Guardians of the Flutes: Idioms of Masculinity Malinowski gives a detailed description of the social organisation of sexuality (social rites, partner choice, etc.) \\"tracing the Trobriand lifecycle from birth through puberty, marriage, and death\\".Notes for sessions six and seven on the background and world of Malinowski by William W Kelly Children do not submit to a system of \\"domestic coercion\\" or \\"regular discipline\\": they \\"enjoy considerable freedom and independence\\". The idea of a child being \\"beaten or otherwise punished in cold blood\\" by a parent is viewed as unnatural and immoral and when proposed by westerners (like the anthropologist) is \\"rejected with resentment\\". Things are asked \\"as from one equal to another; a simple command, implying the expectation of natural obedience, is never heard from parent to child in the Trobriands\\". The event of a person getting angry and striking another person \\"in an outburst of rage\\" sometimes happens, as often from parent to child as from child to parent.p. 52‚Äì53 In later chapters, the parent-child relationship of the Trobrianders is described with details of their complex matrilineal relationship structure in which the biological parentage is ignored. Based on ethnographic data, Malinowski argues that the Freudian Oedipus complex is not universal. Scholarly reception Malinowski's argument that the Oedipus complex is not universal has been questioned by anthropologist Melford E. Spiro in his book Oedipus in the Trobriands (1982).

It is a colorless liquid with a sharp odor similar to that of hydrochloric acid. As methyltrichlorosilane is a reactive compound, it is mainly used a precursor for forming various cross-linked siloxane polymers. Preparation Methyltrichlorosilane results from the direct process of chloromethane with elemental silicon in the presence of a copper catalyst, usually at a temperature of at least 250 ¬∞C.R√∂sch, L; et al. \\"Silicon Compounds, Organic.\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. : 2 CH3Cl + Si ‚Üí (CH3)4-nSiCln \\\\+ other products While this reaction is the standard in industrial silicone production and is nearly identical to the first direct synthesis of methyltrichlorosilane, the overall process is inefficient with respect to methyltrichlorosilane.Rochow, E. The Direct Synthesis of Organosilicon Compounds. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1945, 67, 963. Even though dimethyldichlorosilane is usually the major product, if methyltrichlorosilane is needed, the amount of metal catalyst is reduced. Reactions Hydrolysis and alcoholysis Methyltrichlorosilane undergoes hydrolysis, shown in idealized form here: :MeSiCl3 \\\\+ 3 H2O ‚Üí MeSi(OH)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl The silanol is unstable and will eventually condense to give a polymer network: :MeSi(OH)3 ‚Üí MeSiO1.5 \\\\+ 1.5 H2O Methyltrichlorosilane undergoes alcoholysis (reaction with alcohol) to give alkoxysilanes. Methanol converts it to trimethoxymethylsilane: :MeSiCl3 \\\\+ 3 CH3OH ‚Üí MeSi(OCH3)3 \\\\+ 3 HCl Reduction Reduction of methyltrichlorosilane with alkali metals forms a highly crosslinked material called poly(methylsilyne): :n MeSiCl3 \\\\+ 3n Na ‚Üí[MeSi]n \\\\+ 3n NaCl The reaction illustrates the susceptibility of silicon halides to reductive coupling. Poly(methylsilyne) is soluble in organic solvents, and can be applied to surfaces before being pyrolyzed to give the ceramic material, silicon carbide.Bianconi, Patricia A.; Pitcher, Michael W.; Joray, Scott. \\"A method of preparing poly(methyl- or ethyl-silyne) and silicon carbide ceramics therefrom.\\" U.S. (2006), 15 pp. CODEN: USXXAM US 6989428 B1 20060124 CAN 144:129423 AN 2006:65860. Applications Conversion to polymers and resins One use for methyltrichlorosilane is in the production of methyl silicone resins (highly crosslinked polymers). Because of the stability of the cross-linked polymers resulting from condensation, the resin is stable to 550 ¬∞C in a vacuum, making it an ideal material for electrical insulation at high temperatures. These resins can be used to coat computer chips or other electronic parts since they both repel water and provide thermal isolation. Surface treatments Methyltrichlorosilane vapor reacts with water on surfaces to give a thin layer of methylpolysiloxane, which changes the contact angle of the surface to water. This effect arises because of the oriented layer of methyl groups, making a water-repellent film.Rochow, E. \\"An Introduction to the Chemistry of the Silicones.\\" New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1946. Filter paper treated with methyltrichlorosilane allows organic solvents to pass through, but not water. Another benefit of such water-repellent films is that the polymers formed are stable: one of the only ways to remove the siloxane film is by acid strong enough to dissolve silicone. Reagent in organic synthesis A combination of methyltrichlorosilane and sodium iodide can be used to cleave carbon-oxygen bonds such as methyl ethers. :R'OR + MeSiCl3 \\\\+ NaI + H2O ‚Üí R'OH + RI + MeSiCl2(OH) + NaCl Esters and lactones can also be cleaved with methyltrichlorosilane and sodium iodide to give the corresponding carboxylic acids. Acetals convert to carbonyl compounds. Thus, methyltrichlorosilane can be used to remove acetal protecting groups from carbonyl compounds under mild conditions.Olah, G; et al. \\"Methyltrichlorosilane.\\" Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2001. :RR'C(OMe)2 \\\\+ MeSiCl3 \\\\+ NaI ‚Üí RR'CO + 2 MeI + MeSiCl2(OMe) + NaCl Methyltrichlorosilane and sodium iodide can be used as a means of converting alcohols to their corresponding iodides; however, this reaction does not work as well with primary alcohols. :ROH + MeSiCl3 \\\\+ NaI ‚Üí RI + MeSiCl2(OH) + NaCl Silicon Carbide epitaxy Methyltrichlorosilane is used as a reagent in Silicon Carbide epitaxy to introduce chloride in the gas phase. Chloride is used to reduce the tendency of silicon to react in the gas phase and thus to increase the growth rate of the process.

This compound was formerly used as a preservative in paints, and as a disinfectant. When applied to the leaves of plants, it is an antitranspirant. Applications Phenylmercuric acetate (PMA) has been used against antifungal activity in agriculture and in leather processing and has known to work well. PMA has also been used as an additive in eye-drops and paint in order to preserve them, as a disinfectant, and as a catalyst in polyurethane systems. In the 1950s‚Äì1970s, PMA was used as a catalyst in the 3M Tartan brand polyurethane flexible floors that were commonly in school gymnasiums. School officials worried that mercury vapor was being released into air above the surface of these floors. They had to be carefully removed since mercury is such a toxic heavy metal. Findings The study on PMA as an anti-fungal is the most studied topic for this compound. It has been found that plants treated with PMA transpired more due to the retarded stomatal closure in the plants. Day-time reductions in transpiration by PMA greatly exceed night-time increases in water loss. PMA stunts stomatal closures as well as openings. Research has found that PMA may plausibly decrease the absorbency of guard cell membranes to solutes, thereby retarding all stomatal movements that are osmotically prompted. Hazards PMA can cause Contact Urticaria Syndrome (CUS). Contact urticaria refers to a wheal-and-flare response occurring on the application of chemicals to intact skin. A wheal-and-flare response is a skin eruption that may follow injury or injection of an antigen. It is characterized by swelling and redness caused by a release of histamine. The reaction usually occurs in three stages, beginning with the appearance of an erythematous area at the site of injury, followed by development of a flare surrounding the site; finally a wheal forms at the site as fluid leaks under the skin from surrounding capillaries. CUS has been categorized as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction with IgE (a type of anti-body) playing a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Investigations dealing with CUS seem to suggest that a percentage of urticarias encompass a contact mechanism.

Signature: I.[an] G.[niewosz] N.[a] O.[oleksowie] K.[asztelan] C.[zchowski] Coffin portraits in the National Museum in Warsaw A coffin portrait () was a realistic portrait of the deceased person put on coffins for the funeral and one of the elements of the castrum doloris, but removed before the burial. It became a tradition to decorate coffins of deceased nobles (szlachta) with such funerary art in the times of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries, the time of the baroque in Poland and Sarmatism. The tradition was limited to Commonwealth countries, although the term may also describe the Ancient Egyptian mummy portraits. Design They were commonly painted on sheet metal (copper, tin or lead plates) and fixed on the narrow ends of the coffins at the side where the head of the deceased lay. On the opposite of the coffin there was usually an epitaph, and the sides held a coat of arms. The shape of the upper edges of the portraits was based on the shape of the coffin, and the lower edges were often used to turn the whole into a hexagon or octagon. After the funeral, the coffin portrait would often be hung on the walls of the church that the deceased had contributed to. In time, they increased in size ‚Äì from 40 x 45 cm in the 17th century, to 70 x 72 cm in the 18th century. Coffin portraits on display at Pozna≈Ñ Cathedral, painters unknown. The portraits were highly realistic, with the intent to create an impression that the deceased is taking part in their own funeral; that impression was reinforced often by the subject of the portrait gazing directly at the viewers. Some of them were painted during the life of the deceased. Cultural importance Historian Bernard O'Connor in his memoirs of 1696 wrote: \\"There is so much pomp and ceremony in Polish funerals that you would sooner take them to be a triumphant event than the burial of the dead\\". Indeed, for Polish nobles (szlachta), a proper funeral was extremely important. Those who could afford it spent lavishly on the funeral ceremonies, turning them into major events. But even the poor would try to have at least a basic coffin portrait, albeit those, painted by amateur painters, usually have little or no artistic merit. Until the 20th century, the coffin portraits were ignored by scholars; those painted on silver or tin were stolen from churches and monasteries and then melted down, others were destroyed by treasure hunters and thieves, or simply fell to the ravages of time. Today the surviving coffin portraits provide a wealth of knowledge about culture (clothing, hairstyles and jewellery) of the Commonwealth nobility. Many coffin portraits are still displayed in various churches across Poland; hundreds are held in various museums. The oldest coffin portrait in Poland is that of the king Stefan Batory from the late 16th century. The most recent one is that of priest Marcin Porczy≈Ñski from 1809. Image:Portret trumienny B. D.

Life Harbord was the second son of Sir Charles Harbord (1596‚Äì1679) of Charing Cross, who had been Surveyor General to Charles I, and his second wife Mary van Aelst, daughter of Jan van Aelst of Kent. He entered Parliament in 1661 as member for Dartmouth, and subsequently also represented Thetford and Launceston. History of Parliament Online ‚Äì Harbord, WIlliam In 1672, Harbord became secretary to the Earl of Essex, the new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Essex praised him as \\"a very useful servant\\" and as a man of integrity who was also efficient in dispatching business. He lost the position on Essex's recall from Ireland in 1677. In the parliamentary debates of 1676‚Äì8 Harbord spoke often against the alliance with France, and pressed for the removal of all papists from the King's person. He was notoriously intemperate in speech (he has been called one of the \\"angry men\\" of the Commons), and on one occasion he was warned not to disparage Charles II. Thereafter he took care to exclude the King from his attacks on the Government: \\"the King is the best man living, and the furthest from Popery\\". However he frequently attacked the future James II: embittered by the death of his brother Charles at the Battle of Sole Bay in 1672, he made the absurd claim that James, as Lord Admiral, had betrayed the English fleet, and was forced to withdraw the allegation. He was a firm believer in the reality of the Popish Plot, and in concert with Ralph Montagu, whom he helped to get into Parliament, took an important part in the attack on the Earl of Danby. The revelation of Danby's secret dealings with France elated him to the point of hysteria: one historian has described his Commons speech on the subject (\\"poisoning and stabbing are in use....I am afraid that the King will be murdered\\") as \\"ravings\\".Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.149 His fear of assassination by the alleged plotters seems to have been genuine, and he briefly considered quitting England. In the parliament of 1679, in which he represented Thetford, he spoke against Danby's pardon, attacked John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, and was eager for the disbanding of the army. He was returned for the Oxford Parliament of 1681, and was expected to play a crucial role, but the King dissolved it after only a week. Leaving England on the accession of James II, Harbord served as a volunteer in the Imperial Army at Siege of Buda in 1686. He accompanied William of Orange on his invasion of England in 1688, and the following year was made a Privy Counsellor , to the dismay of the Tory party, and Paymaster of the Forces in Ireland. He returned to the Commons as member for Launceston. By now he has been described as an angry, embittered veteran, whose eloquence might win a debate, but rarely prevailed on an actual vote. In one of his frequent lapses of political judgment, he moved that two of James II's judges be hanged for treason, a proposal which was crushingly rejected.Kenyon, J.P. Robert Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland 1641-1702 Gregg Revivals 1992 p.237 Harbord was made Vice-Treasurer of Ireland in 1690. After a considerable delay he went to Ireland but returned without leave within a few months, pleading ill-health, having achieved nothing, according to his enemies, but in making a considerable profit at the Army's expense from his office as Paymaster General of the Irish Forces, and leaving the troops wholly out of pay. He was nominated by the King as Ambassador to Constantinople on 2 November 1691, although William had taken a very poor view of his conduct in Ireland (\\"in another country he would have been hanged\\" the King said severely). He left England on 9 November, arriving in Vienna on 8 March 1692 to mediate between Sultan Ahmed II and the Emperor Leopold I, but died in Belgrade of a malignant fever before reaching his posting in Belgrade on 31 July 1692. Family Harbord married twice. By his first wife, Mary Duck, daughter of Arthur Duck, whom he married in 1661, he had three daughters, * Mary Harbord (d.1715), who married Sir Edward Ayscough (1650‚Äì1699), * Margaret Harbord, who married Robert King, 2nd Baron Kingston, * Grace Harbord, who married Thomas Hatcher; and by his second, Catherine Russell, daughter of Edward Russell and Penelope Hill (and niece of the 1st Duke of Bedford), and had one daughter, * Letitia Harbord (d. 1722), who married Sir Rowland Winn, 3rd Baronet, of Nostell.

It is considered to be one of the holiest Islamic sites in Egypt.

Architecture Following the beheading of Hussain ibn Ali in Iraq during the Battle of Karbala, in 1153 his head was sent to Cairo, Egypt to be protected by building a mausoleum for it completed in 1154. Of this original Fatimid architectural structure, only the lower part of the south side gate called Bab Al-Akhdar remains original in the mosque today. A couple years later, a minaret was added to the original Fatimid gateway by Ayyubid Salih Nagm al-Din in 1237. The minaret has panel carvings of overlapping lines that create patterns called arabesque popular in Islamic Architecture. The different minarets among this mosque play a role in portraying the various powers that ruled Cairo and the way they laminated their power through architecture. Finally in 1874, Isma'il Pasha (Khedive Isma'il) reconstructed Al-Hussein mosque inspired by the Gothic Revival Architecture. Wanting to modernize Cairo, Isma'il Pasha created a mosque with Italian Gothic style and Ottoman style minarets. This mixture of various architectural styles famous is Islamic architecture during the khedival time period is called Islamic eclecticism. Today, the latest addition to Al-Hussein Mosque are three large canopy umbrellas. It was added to protect those praying outdoors from the sun during the summer days and from the rain during the winter. They are mechanically operated and follow the designs of many Saudi Arabian mosques made from steal and teflon. Many people still come to this mosque to pray and visit the mausoleum on a normal basis. Although non-Muslims are not allowed into the building, the structure is still viewed from the outside by tourists. Ras al-Husayn  The Fatimid Period  According to Fatimid tradition, in the year 985, the 15th Fatimid Caliph, Abu Mansoor Nizar al-Aziz Billah, traced the site of his great-grandfather's head through the office of a contemporary in Baghdad. It remained buried in the town of Ashkelon for about 250 years, until 1153. It was \\"rediscovered\\" in 1091 at a time when Badr al-Jamali, the grand vizier under Caliph al- Mustansir, had just reconquered the region for the Fatimid Caliphate. Upon the discovery, he ordered the construction of a new Friday mosque and mashhad (memorial shrine) on the site. After the 21st Fatimid Imam At-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim went into seclusion, his uncle, Abd al Majid, occupied the Fatimid Empire's throne. Fearing disrespect and possible traitorous activity, the Majidi-monarch, Al-Zafir, ordered the transfer of the head to Cairo. Husayn's casket was unearthed and moved from Ashkelon to Cairo on Sunday 8 Jumada al- Thani, 548 (31 August 1153). Yemeni writer Syedi Hasan bin Asad described the transfer of the head thus in his Risalah manuscript: \\"When the Raas [head of] al Imam al Husain was taken out of the casket, in Ashkelon, drops of the fresh blood were visible on the Raas al Imam al Husain and the fragrance of Musk spread all over.\\" According to historians Al-Maqrizi, Ahmad al-Qalqashandi, and Ibn Muyassar, the casket reached Cairo on Tuesday 10 Jumada al-Thani (2 September 1153). Taken by boat to the Kafuri (Garden), the casket was buried there in a place called Qubbat al-Daylam or Turbat al Zafr'an (currently known as al-Mashhad al-Hussaini or B‚Äôab Mukhallaf‚Äôat al-Rasul). All Fatimid Imam- Caliphs, from Abdullah Al Mahdi to Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, were buried at Turbah al-Zafaran, in the vicinity of the mosque and of the main Fatimid Palaces. The Grand vizier Tala'i ibn Ruzzik subsequently intended for the head to be moved to a new mosque and shrine he purposely built in 1160 (the Mosque of al-Salih Tala'i, south of Bab Zuwayla), but this transfer never occurred.  The Ayyubid Period  Regarding one of the \\"custodians\\" who brought Husayn's casket to Cairo, the famous Mamluk historian of Egypt, Mohiyuddin Abd al-Zahir, wrote: > \\"When Salahuddin came to power he seized all the Palaces of the Aimmat > Fatemiyeen and looted their properties and treasures. He destroyed the > valuable and rare collection of hundreds of thousands of books available in > libraries, along the river Nile. When he learned through his intelligence > agents that one of the custodians of Raas al Imam al Husain was highly > respected by the people of the city of Qahera, he surmised that perhaps he > would be aware of the treasures of the Aimmat Fatemiyeen. Salahuddin issued > orders to present him in his court. He inquired of him the whereabouts of > the Fatemi treasures. The nobleman flatly denied any knowledge of the > treasures. Salahuddin was angered, and ordered his intelligence agents to > ask him through 'third-degree-torture', but the nobleman bore the torture > and repeated his previous statement that he knew nothing of any treasures. > Salahuddin ordered his soldiers to put a cap containing centipedes on the > head of the nobleman, such a type of punishment was so severe and unbearable > that none could survive even for a few minutes. > > \\"Prior to putting the Cap of Centipedes on the head, his hair was shaved, to > make it easy for the centipedes to suck blood, which in turn made holes in > [his] skull. In spite of that punishment the noble custodian of Husain's > Head felt no pain at all. Salahuddin ordered more centipedes to be put on > the nobleman's head, but it could not kill or pain him. Finally, Salahuddin > Ayyubi ordered for a tight cap full of centipedes to accomplish the result. > Even this method could not torture or kill him. The Ayyubid brutes were > greatly astounded further when they saw, on removing the cap, the centipedes > were dead. Salahuddin asked the nobleman to reveal the secret of this > miracle. The nobleman revealed as follow[s]: When Raas al Imam al Husain was > brought to Qasar, Al Moizziyat al Qahera, he had carried the casket on his > head. 'O Salahuddin! This is the secret of my safety.'\\"  Recent History  right To mark the site of burial, known as Ra's al- Husayn () or Mashhad Ra's al-Husayn, Taher Saifuddin had a zarih built in Mumbai, which was later installed at the mosque in 1965 just before his death. It was subsequently inaugurated by his son, Mohammed Burhanuddin. According to tradition: The zarih was originally meant for Al Abbas Mosque, in Karbala, Iraq but could not be installed there: The location and the zarih had previously been measured precisely, but it simply didn't fit. Taher Saifuddin, the maker of the zarih, received divine guidance by way of intuition that out of loyalty, Al-Abbas ibn Ali-- who was martyred along with his step brother, Husayn, at the Battle of Karbala-- could not allow Ra's al-Husayn be without a zarih. As a consequence, Al-Abbas' zarih was flown to Cairo and installed at Ra's al-Husayn at the Al-Hussein mosque, instead.  Bab al-Mukhallafat al- Nabawiyya al-Sharifa  The Bab al-Mukhallafat al-Nabawiyya at the Hussein Mosque Next to Ras al-Husayn is a crypt housing artifacts believed to belong to Muhammad. A door laden with silver and gold was built by Mohammed Burhanuddin II and installed at the site in 1986.

Viljanen joined Sonata Arctica in spring 2007 in order to replace Jani Liimatainen, who left the band in August 2007 to fulfill his civil duties in Finland. The decision was only made official on August 8, 2007, but Elias Viljanen had been known to replace Liimatainen in concerts during the spring and summer tour. Viljanen cites KISS, Metallica, Slayer, and Whitesnake as his musical influences. Biography Early life Elias Viljanen performing with Sonata Arctica in 2016. Viljanen was born in 1975, and started playing the guitar at eight, in 1983. Initially, he says that he began playing \\"because his dad forced him... and, of course, I wanted to be like KISS.\\" He got his first acoustic guitar a year later, but did not get an electric guitar until nearly four years later. After finally convincing his parents to let him purchase his first electric guitar (a white Leadstar), he took a few guitar lessons and learned some basic chords, but believed that if he wanted to learn rock'n'roll, it would be something he would have to teach himself. Around that same time, Viljanen began playing in local bands, heavily influenced by Metallica's early thrash metal. At age seventeen, his band Depravity was signed by Adipocere Records, this being Viljanen's first record contract. In the early 1990s, Viljanen was introduced to the music of Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, but initially wrote it off as \\"just music for sports.\\" As time went by, however, he developed a love of Satriani's music, calling it the \\"bluesiest rock'n'roll,\\" and considers Vai \\"God.\\" Viljanen also lists Dream Theater as his progressive metal influence that pushed him towards the style he is today. A little later he became a drummer in a band called Twilight Lamp, which released EP \\"Grandiose\\" in 1999. Formation of Elias Viljanen and Evil Spirit As 2001 approached, Viljanen felt that he had to get his own project going. He spent several months writing down his music ideas he'd had for many years, but never expressed. He did have doubts, however, about his solo project, stating: To prepare for his three-demo, The Axe-Master, Viljanen practiced for 2‚Äì3 hours each day for nearly four months. While he may have had doubts before, they were now erased, as the demos and recording became both a dream and an obsession. Viljanen never dreamed of getting a serious record contract out of it, but sent his demos out anyway. The record company Lion Music, however, replied and offered him a recording contract. Thus, eighteen years after the dream began, Elias Viljanen's first album, Taking the Lead was born. Feedback for Taking the Lead was overall positive, placing in the top ten hard rock/shred CD's at guitar9.com in 2003. Steve Vai himself also got Viljanen's CD, and gave him some encouraging feedback as well. In 2004, Lion Music again offered Viljanen a record contract when he sent in new demos, and he entered the Studios with Evil Spirit in early 2005. Recording went well, and he emerged satisfied with the completion of his second solo album, The Leadstar. Sonata Arctica and recent work Elias Viljanen traveled with the band Sonata Arctica in 2007, filling in for their guitarist Jani Liimatainen on tour. On August 8, Sonata Arctica formally released a letter naming Viljanen the official guitarist in Sonata Arctica. Liimatainen had apparently not been fulfilling his mandatory civic duties as declared by the Finnish government, and this had caused a rift in between him and the other members of the band. Viljanen took up the mantle as guitarist with much controversy, with many hard-core fans still wanting Liimatainen to be a part of the project. But Sonata Arctica were adamant, as was Liimatainen, and Viljanen thus maintained his status. Viljanen toured with Sonata Arctica in support of their album Unia in late 2007 and early 2008. During the time off from tour in 2008, he began work on his third studio album, but the recording of Sonata Arctica's sixth studio album. So, Viljanen entered the studio with Sonata Arctica for the first time in the earlier half of 2009, recording the album The Days of Grays. As they were touring at the time of the release, Viljanen did not get to begin recording work on his album until early 2009. Later that year, his third studio album with Evil Spirit was released, Fire-Hearted. Personal life Viljanen has stated that, if not a musician, he would likely be a silversmith. He enjoys the racing video game Need for Speed: Underground, likes parrots and his favorite sport is ice hockey. He is also married.

He is a defence columnist for the Sunday Times, and he also contributes to Jane's Defence Weekly, CNN, and the Times of London. He was threatened for his investigative reporting which uncovered scandals in the purchase of the arms by Sri Lankan Defence personnel, particularly the Sri Lankan Airforce. He has won several international journalism awards for his work, and in 2000, the New York Times described him as \\"the country's leading military correspondent.\\"  1998 attack  In 1997 and '98, Athas wrote a series of articles for the Sunday Times detailing the disappearance of 70,000 mortar shells purchased by the Sri Lankan government from Zimbabwe. The shells first appeared to have been hijacked by the rebel group Tamil Tigers, but experts later concluded the communique allegedly from the Tigers had been faked. For his reporting, Athas was \\"verbally and physically attacked by both Government officials and thugs\\". In 1998, Athas wrote another series of articles on irregularities in aircraft purchases by the Air Force. That year, a group of armed men entered his home, threatened Athas's wife and seven-year-old daughter, and held an automatic pistol to Athas's head. The government then ordered protective security placed around Athas's home, which would remain until 2007. In 2002, two Air Force officers were convicted of having participated in the attack, and were sentenced to nine years' imprisonment apiece. The judge stated, \\"'In a democratic country like Sri Lanka, newspapers have a right to expose the corruption of anyone. If crime is used to suppress it, then stern action should be taken.\\" Athas praised the verdict, but also called for investigations into unsolved attacks on other journalists.  2005 Official Secrets Act threat  On 26 July 2005, President Chandrika Kumaratunga told a meeting of 1,000 military officials that she was considering charging Athas under the Official Secrets Act after Athas wrote a column describing the purchase of a British logistics landing craft as a waste of money. The law carried a maximum charge of fourteen years' imprisonment. The Committee to Protect Journalists protested the remark, stating, \\"We're appalled by these threatening remarks against our colleague Iqbal Athas who is being targeted for doing his job as a journalist by promoting debate on matters of public interest.\\"  Reporting on MiG purchase  In two articles in August 2007, Athas reported on the purchase of second-hand MiG-27 jet fighters from Ukraine, suggesting that the deal had been corrupt. The first, on 12 August, was titled \\"MiGs loaded with millions in mega frauds; The Sunday Times investigation reveals shocking double-deals and wheeler-dealings; While Lanka remains hush-hush, Ukraine Govt. orders full probe\\". Athas traced the purchase to \\"Belimissa Holdings\\", a company ostensibly based in the UK but not listed in the UK Company Register. After the report, his security was withdrawn by the government, leading Reporters Without Borders (RSF) and the Committee to Protect Journalists to issue statements of concern for his safety. A protest was held outside Athas' house on 27 August by government supporters, which RSF described as a \\"parody of a demonstration, clearly organised by the authorities and putting Athas in serious danger.\\" The Sri Lanka Working Journalists Association criticised it as \\"systematic intimidation\\". W. G. Gunaratne, a journalist who translated Athas's articles into Sinhala for the newspaper Lankadeepa, also reportedly received a death threat from an Air Force officer. The Parliament of Sri Lanka later launched a probe into the purchase.  Awards  In 1994, Athas was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which recognises journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks, threats, or imprisonment. In 2007, he received the Alfred I. duPont‚ÄìColumbia University Award for his work with a CNN team covering the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.

Gruennert 29 July 1944: sponsored by Mrs. Walter A. Blodsoe: and delivered to War Shipping Administration (WSA) December 1944 for use as a merchant cargo ship. Prior to 1950 she was owned by WSA and the Maritime Commission; and, as Kenneth E. Gruennert and later as Grommet Reefer, she was operated by several merchant lines, including Grace Lines, Inc.. and Alaska Transportation Co.  Assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service  Grommet Reefer was transferred to the Navy by the Maritime Commission 1 March 1950 and assigned to MSTS. Manned by a civilian crew, she operated in the Pacific Ocean out of U.S. West Coast ports, carrying military cargo and frozen and refrigerated foodstuffs. She steamed to American bases in the Marshalls, the Marianas, and other islands in the Western Pacific for more than a year. After returning to San Francisco, California, 25 March 1951, she departed for the U.S. East Coast 4 April and reached New York City 25 April.  Operating in the Mediterranean and North Atlantic  Departing New York 29 June, Grommet Reefer sailed to the Mediterranean where she steamed to ports in North Africa and Italy before returning to New York 13 August. After completing a cargo run to Bremerhaven and back, she sailed 22 October for a 2-month deployment to the Mediterranean. From January to April 1952 she made three round-trip voyages to Western Europe, and during the next 2 months she supplied American bases in Labrador and Greenland.

It retells the story of how Doss and her husband Carl, a Methodist minister, adopted twelve children of various ethnic backgrounds (White Americans, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, Mexican, and Native American).  Summary  \\"I didn't yearn for a career, or maids and a fur coat, or a trip to Europe. All in the world I wanted was a happy, normal little family. Perhaps, if God could arrange it, Carl and I could have a boy first, and after that, a little girl. God didn't arrange it.\\" Thus opens the story of the Doss family. After Helen and Carl are told they cannot have biological children, Carl suggests adopting an infant. After some initial obstacles, they adopt a six-week-old, blonde, blue-eyed baby boy, who actually looks like Carl. After Donny joins the family, they try to adopt another child, hoping for a little girl this time. They face a lot of resistance from the agencies due to their financial situation as well as the fact that they already have a child. They pursue private adoption for a time, but after failure, they return to the agencies. A social worker makes a stray comment about a Turkish-Portuguese baby that they can't place, saying \\"That's what happens with those mixed-blood children...Nobody wants them. They are classed as unadoptable, same as any child with a defect.\\" Helen and Carl are shocked and horrified that anyone would reject a child and offer to adopt him. The agency refuses to place the child with them, claiming that they \\"would rather see a child raised in an orphanage, than by parents who look so different.\\" Helen and Carl realize that other agencies may not feel the same way and decide to pursue adoption of \\"unadoptable children.\\" Finally, they are contacted about a two-month-old baby girl. The birth parents are Filipino-Chinese and English-French. Helen names her Laura after Carl's mother. Two weeks later they adopt Susie, who is blond with blue-eyes, but considered unadoptable because she is frail/sickly and has a birth mark on her face. When Donny gets older, he wants a brother \\"just his size.\\" Many of the subsequent adoptions occur as a by-product of trying to find Donny's missing brother. The Dosses adopt a total of 12 children. In their final adoption, when Donny is 9, they gain baby Gregory, 9-year-old Dorothy, and Richard, age 9,- Donny's long awaited brother. Through the years, they deal with racism and prejudice from neighbors, family members, and the children's classmates.

Found guilty also of 11 counts of attempted murder and considered to have 'little hope of rehabilitation', he was sentenced in 2012 to indefinite detention. Some of the charges related to sending four cases of poisoned water to talent agencies, a bank and a judge. The water had been laced with the poisonous industrial solvent dimethyl sulfide. The first recipient of the letter bomb was Abdelmagid Radi on August 11, who sustained minor injuries on opening the letter. The second bomb was sent to real estate lawyer Terrence Reiber on August 19, who called police after noticing a petroleum-type odour coming from the letter. Police destroyed the letter bomb. Reiber had represented Arnaout in a previous criminal matter. The third bomb was received by Guelph, Ontario building contractor John Becker on August 22. The device failed to explode. When residents complained about Arnaout, and he was eventually evicted, he wrongly blamed Becker. Arnaout had a previous conviction for criminal harassment in April, 2003, for which he received a conditional discharge. The charge stemmed the harassing of managers of a Toronto modelling agency with which he had signed, hoping for a career as a male model. When Arnaout failed to get any work as a model, he allegedly began calling the agency repeatedly and threatening them, claiming to be a member of the Russian mafia. Police were already investigating Arnaout since June 2007 after harassment complaints by Toronto resident Steven Scott. Arnaout was wanted on an arrest warrant which had been was issued on June 26 charging him with criminal harassment of Scott, a former employer. On August 30, 2007, Arnaout was taken into custody in connection to the letter bombs. At the time of his arrest, a rental car driven by him was found with 3 similar explosives inside. The Toronto Police bomb disposal unit did not defuse the explosives but instead transported them to the Leslie Street Spit where they were destroyed in a controlled explosion. The transport of the explosives by police closed the Don Valley Parkway and parts of the Gardiner Expressway for several hours. After his arrest, police also search his rental apartment in an East York home, nicknamed the Bombay Bunker. Police indicated the bombings were not due to racial or terrorist motives. Arnaout now faces three counts of attempted murder, three counts of attempt to cause an explosion, one count of illegal possession of explosives, and one count of criminal harassment.

Education Robert Lewis \\"Sam\\" Wetzel, of Clarksburg, West Virginia, graduated high school in 1948 and was planning to attend Purdue University and a career as an engineer. A recently approved candidate for the United States Military Academy at West Point dropped out, and Wetzel ended up being his replacement. Military service He graduated from West Point in 1952 as an infantry officer. He was immediately deployed to the Korean War, where he saw action as a company commander. In 1961, Captain Wetzel was the aide of Major General William Westmoreland, then Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. He also commanded a mechanized infantry company in Germany. Lieutenant Colonel Wetzel was deployed to Vietnam in 1968 as the commander of the 4th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment (United States), the \\"Polar Bears\\". After an enemy bullet nicked him on the forehead, he declined a Purple Heart, judging the wound too insignificant to mention, despite the fact that it left him with a permanent scar. Returning from the front, Wetzel eventually married an American Vietnam widow with five young children. He was promoted to colonel and soon assumed command of a brigade in Fort Carson, Colorado. In 1975, he was promoted to brigadier general and sent to West Germany. He then began a rapid ascent. He was given command of the First Infantry Division (forward) in Goeppingen, Germany. When this command concluded, the commander of all European and American forces in Europe, General Alexander Haig, then personally pinned Wetzel's second star on him. From 1978-79, Wetzel served as Haig's chief-of-staff in Belgium. Just before Wetzel's arrival at Haig's office, the Soviets had deployed their SS-20 theater nuclear missiles in Europe. This upset the entire balance of NATO deterrence and Western security. During this year together, Haig, Wetzel and the rest of the staff crafted what became the West's strategic response - deployment in Europe of the Pershing II missiles, which could hit Moscow in the event of war, allowing only minutes for the Soviets to react. During the next four years, domestic political battles began in NATO countries as to whether the Pershing II missiles would actually be deployed. After serving as Haig's Chief of Staff, Wetzel commanded the Third Infantry Division in W√ºrzburg. Wetzel led his division to victory in the annual war games staged in West Germany. In 1981, Wetzel was diagnosed with terminal melanoma cancer. He was given less than a year to live, and offered a full medical disability in exchange for retirement. Wetzel refused. The Army reluctantly permitted him to stay on, but only after he signed a full waiver. Judging Wetzel to be at death's door, the Army sent him back to the United States. However, he made a full recovery. He was soon placed in command of the infantry training center in Fort Benning, Georgia. In 1983, Wetzel was promoted to lieutenant general. and he returned to the troops in Germany. Wetzel's first position back in Germany was Deputy Commander in Chief of U.S. Forces in Europe. The NATO allies had finally approved the Pershing II plan. Immediately upon his arrival, it became Wetzel's job to receive and deploy the Pershing II missiles in the midst of anti-war demonstrations all over Europe. Today, Cold War historians (relying on the candid confessions of defeated Russian leaders) credit the deployment of the Pershing II missiles as one of three key factors that broke the Soviets' back and ended the Cold War (the other two being the Reagan defense build-up and SDI specifically). In 1986, Colin Powell succeeded him in command of V Corps in Frankfurt, Germany. That was Wetzel's last assignment before retirement. Awards and decorations Wetzel's awards include the Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star, two Legion of Merits, six Air Medals, Joint Superior Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal, and Combat Infantryman's Badge with Star.

Its wild origins are uncertain but are suspected to lie in the western Himalayas. Description Rosa moschata is a shrub (to 3m) with single white 5 cm flowers in a loose cyme or corymb, blooming on new growth from late spring until late autumn in warm climates, or from late summer onwards in cool-summer climates. The sepals are 2 cm long with slender points. The flowers have a characteristic \\"musky\\" scent, emanating from the stamens, which is also found in some of its descendants. Painting of a Musk Rose, 1902. The prickles on the stems are straight or slightly curved and have a broad base. The light- or greyish-green leaves have 5 to 7 ovate leaflets with small teeth; the veins are sometimes pubescent and the rachis bears prickles. The stipules are narrow with spreading, free tips. Small, ovate fruits called hips are borne, turning orange-red in autumn. This species has historically been confused with Rosa brunonii, a closely related, tall-climbing species from the Himalayas that bears flowers in late spring and which possesses a similar, musky scent. They can be distinguished in gardens by their season of flowering and by their differing growth habits. The variety 'Plena' bears semi-double flowers, and a form with study name \\"Temple Musk\\", found in the United States, bears more fully double flowers. Cultivation It has been contended that no truly wild examples of the musk rose have been found, though it is recorded in cultivation as least as far back as the 16th century, indeed being mentioned in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1595/96). It is important in cultivation as a parent to several groups of cultivated roses, notably the damask rose and the noisette group, and is valued for its scent and for its unusually long season of bloom among rose species.

At the time its proposal, the building would have been the tallest structure under construction in the city, and was the only building planned to rise over 400 feet (122 meters) up for proposal in Dallas. Upon completion, the Victory Tower would stand as the 8th-tallest building in the city, rising to a height of 650 feet (198 m) with 43 floors. History The Victory Tower's official groundbreaking took place in late 2006, with construction underway by early 2007. The tower, designed by the New York City- based Kohn Pedersen Fox architectural firm, was originally proposed as the centerpiece building project of the new Victory Park development in Dallas, along with one other skyscraper. The other tower, One Victory Tower, was planned to rise 633 feet (193 m) and 40 floors on the lot adjacent to the Victory Tower. However, the project was not approved by the city, and was subsequently canceled. According to an unnamed source at Hillwood Development, the Victory Tower project has been placed \\"on hold until 2011\\" as of March 13, 2008. The construction crane has been dismantled and removed. The construction fence has been whitewashed, covering all evidence of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and Tower project. Height Upon completion, the Victory Tower will rise 650 feet (198 m), surpassing the Thanksgiving Tower to become the 8th- tallest structure in the city. However, as the building will consist of a Mandarin Oriental hotel and commercial offices on its lower floors, with only the upper floors serving as residential condominiums, the tower will not become the tallest all-residential building in the city, a record currently held by Republic Center Tower I. It will, however, break the record for the highest residence in the city, surpassing both Republic Center Tower I and the proposed Museum Tower. Furthermore, upon completion, the Victory Tower will stand as the tallest building in the new Victory Park neighborhood of Dallas, a record currently held by the 440-foot (134 m) W Dallas Victory Hotel and Residences. Features The Victory Tower would stand as one of the tallest mixed-use buildings in the state of Texas upon completion, housing a Mandarin Oriental hotel, residential condominiums, office space, commercial retail levels, six restaurants, and a spa. Mandarin Oriental will be the primary tenant of the building, occupying the lowest eleven stories of the tower with a 120-room hotel and the building's upper 21 floors with 91 Mandarin Oriental- branded residences. The hotel staterooms will be among the largest in the city, averaging 750 square feet (70 m¬≤) each. On the lower levels, the tower will also contain 275,000 square feet (25,548 m¬≤) of commercial office space and a luxury 75,000 square feet (6,967 m¬≤) retail mall.

Background According to historian Robert Mackay, in 1585 a meeting took place at Elgin, Scotland between George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness and Huistean Du Mackay, 13th of Strathnaver.Mackay, Robert. (1829). History of the House and Clan of Mackay. pp. 149 - 152. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert. (1580 - 1656). A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. pp. 182, 183 and 184. The purpose of the meeting, according to Robert Mackay, was to repair relations which had become damaged between the Earl of Sutherland, Earl of Caithness and Huistean Du Mackay (Hugh Mackay), due to actions by the Clan Gunn and Hugh Mackay in Assynt, both having gone there on the orders of the Earl of Caithness. However, historian Angus Mackay does not state that Hugh Mackay attended this meeting and that the purpose of the meeting was to break up the confederacy between Hugh Mackay and the Earl of Caithness.Mackay, Angus. (1906). Book of Mackay. p. 111. According to historian Robert Mackay, it was decided at the meeting that the Clan Gunn should be \\"made away\\", because they were judged to be the principal authors of these \\"troubles and commotions\\", but that both Hugh Mackay and George Sinclair, Earl of Caithness were unwilling to attack their old allies the Clan Gunn and therefore departed from the meeting at Elgin. In consequence, in 1586, George Gordon, Marquess of Huntly came north to Sutherland, the lands of his cousin, Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland. He sent a message to both Hugh Mackay and George Sinclair, Earl of Caithness to meet him at Sutherland's seat of Dunrobin Castle. According to historian Robert Mackay the Earl of Caithness met with the Gordons of Huntly and Sutherland but Mackay did not and was therefore denounced as a rebel. However, according to historian Angus Mackay, Hugh Mackay did attend this second meeting but refused the proposals of the Gordons of Huntly and Sutherland that the Gunns should be destroyed. However, the Earl of Caithness did indeed agree with the Gordons that the Gunns should be destroyed. Robert Mackay also states that the Earl of Caithness agreed with the Gordon's proposals at this second meeting to attack the Gunns. The battle According to historian Robert Mackay, Sinclair, Earl of Caithness sent his men under the command of Henry Sinclair to attack the Gunns. Henry Sinclair being the uncle of the brothers Hugh Mackay (of Strathnaver) and William Mackay (of Bighouse). The Gunns who were informed of these proceedings, gathered their men and were joined by a strong body of men from Mackay's country under William Mackay. On arrival William Mackay proposed that together they should attack the men of Sutherland, but he was overruled by the Gunns who opted to attack the Sinclairs of Caithness instead. Historian Angus Mackay however, gives a different account of how the Mackays under William Mackay came together with the Gunns. Angus Mackay states that the forces of the Earl of Caithness and the Earl of Sutherland pursued the Gunns from Caithness and into the hills of Strathnaver, and at this time a strange coincidence took place: William Mackay (younger brother of Hugh) had raided the MacLeods taking much cattle.Mackay, Angus. (1906). Book of Mackay. p. 111 -112. As William Mackay was returning home he came across the Earl of Sutherland's men who were searching for the Gunns and a fight took place over the cattle. William Mackay's men fought a rear guard action and the following morning they stumbled across the Gunns who were retiring from the Sinclairs of Caithness. Together the Mackays and Gunns attacked the Sinclairs, defeating them and killing their leader Henry Sinclair, who was a cousin of the Earl of Caithness. Historian Robert Mackay agrees on the outcome of the battle in that the Mackays and Gunns together defeated the Sinclairs of Caithness, killing their leader Henry Sinclair, but also points out that the historical account of the battle (given below) by Sir Robert Gordon, who was himself a younger son of Alexander Gordon, Earl of Sutherland, \\"says nothing as to his countrymen being at this conflict, perhaps because he is unwilling to admit that they were beaten, - a fact which he never admits; but he, at the same time, leaves room to imply that they were guilty of treachery, which is much worse than a defeat. The day and place were fixed for their meeting the Caithness men, and they did not appear, but allowed those to be cut down by a host which had laid their accounts to have the combined forces of Caithness and Sutherland to contend with\\". Historical accounts of the battle Robert Mackay, quoting Sir Robert Gordon 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon (1580-1656), who was living at the time of the battle and who was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, wrote an account of the battle in his book A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. However, the first account given below is that of early 19th- century historian Robert Mackay in his book History of the House and Clan of Mackay published in 1829 and quoting from Gordon. > So having the advantage of the hill, they set upon the enemy with a resolute > courage. The Caithness-men came short with their first flight of arrows; by > contrary, the Guns spared their shot until they came hard to the enemy, > which then they bestowed among them to great advantage. In the end the clan > Gun overthrew the Caithness-men at Auldgown, upon the borders of Caithness, > the year 1586, and killed seven score of their most resolute men, with their > captain Henry Sinclair, cousin to the Earl of Caithness, and uncle to Hugh > and William Mackay.

Sir Robert Gordon's original account The following account is that given by Sir Robert Gordon (1580-1656), younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, which was actually first published in 1813 in the book A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland, which itself is based on Gordon's original 17th-century manuscript: > The Earle of Southerland his host converyning spedelie, went on forward to > pursue Clangun, according to promise.

Early life Miller was born at Fairy Meadow, near Wollongong, New South Wales, the son of Samuel King Miller, head teacher of the Deniliquin public school and his wife Sarah Isabella, n√©e Jones. He completed his education there. Career At 16 years of age, Miller entered the service of the Bank of New South Wales at Deniliquin (1876), and six years later was transferred at his own request to the head office at Sydney. Showing great attention to his work Miller became an accountant in 1896, and four years later, assistant to the general manager. In 1909 he was appointed metropolitan inspector. In 1911 the federal Labour party decided to bring in a bill to establish a national bank. Miller was summoned to Melbourne (then federal capital) to see the prime minister, Andrew Fisher. The bill was discussed and Miller was asked to become the first governor on a salary of ¬£4000 a year; significantly more than the salary of the prime minister. The appointment was somewhat surprising, Miller relatively unknown, but inquiries must have been made which satisfied Fisher that Miller was a man with the knowledge, courage and caution, required for the office. His appointment was dated 1 June 1912, and in July the bank's business was started in a small room in Collins Street, Melbourne, the staff consisting of Miller, and a messenger lent by the department of the treasury. The sole capital was ¬£10,000 advanced by the government. The first step was the establishment of a savings bank department, which was followed by the opening of the general banking department on 20 January 1913. On the opening day over ¬£2,000,000 was received in deposits, the greater part being Commonwealth government accounts. Miller began his work as governor with great soundness and caution. It was essential that the public should have complete faith in the new venture, and he was careful to avoid competition with the established banks which might be considered unfair. In the first year progress was comparatively slow though steady, but the bank soon began to expand, and when World War I came in August 1914 it was in a position to do its most important work. In the uncertain early days of the war it made advances to the government, and it took complete charge of the issue of war loans in Australia. Before the war had ended ¬£190,000,000 had been subscribed. The government took control of the primary products of Australia, and the control of the issuing of new capital by public companies. In the transactions which consequently arose Miller's advice and the resources of the bank were always at the service of the various governments, and were sources of great strength to them. By the end of the war the bank was firmly established, with its head office at Sydney, about 40 branches, and 2758 agencies and receiving offices in Australia, the islands, and London. Late life and legacy After World War I the bank was able to be of great use in connection with repatriation, and in 1920 it was given control of the Australian note issue. Miller was an indefatigable worker until his unexpected death from heart disease in Sydney on 6 June 1923. He was buried in Waverley Cemetery. Miller married in 1895 Laura Constance, daughter of Dr J. T. Heeley, who survived him with four sons and two daughters. He was created K.C.M.G. in 1920. A Denison Miller memorial scholarship was founded in his memory at the University of Sydney. He was interested in various charities, and was a founder and for some time honorary treasurer of the New South Wales Institute of Bankers. He advocated a strong immigration policy after the war, and had great confidence in the future of Australia in spite of the war debt. After his death, profits from the note issue continued to bring large sums to the consolidated revenue, and the combined capital and reserves of the bank in 1940 were approaching ¬£10,000,000, all built up out of profits.

Callery studied at the Art Students League of New York (1921‚Äì1925) with Edward McCartan and moved to Paris in 1930. From 1930 to 1940, Callery worked in France, where she met and became friends with Pablo Picasso,Mary Callery,Mary Callery Sculpture. Distributed by Wittenborn and Company, New York, 1961.

During this same period, she also developed her talents as a modern sculptor, studying privately under Jacques Loutchansky.Paul Cummings,\\"Dictionary of Contemporary American Artists\\" 1 to 5th edition, St. Martin's Press, New York; St. James Press, London  Career  When Germany occupied Paris during World War II, she returned to the United States with \\"more Picassos than anyone in America\\" according to Alfred Barr of the Museum of Modern Art. After returning to New York, Callery played an instrumental role in the development and growth of ULAE (Universal Limited Art Editions, Inc.). For many years, ULAE primarily published reproductions. It is thought by many that Mary Callery was the first artist to print original work at ULAE. Callery‚Äôs first edition with ULAE, Sons of Morning, was completed in 1955. The paper that Callery‚Äôs second edition, Variations on a Theme of ‚ÄúCallery-L√©ger‚Äù, was printed on was called the ‚ÄúCallery gray‚Äù was used by Mrs. Grosman for the studio‚Äôs first printed labels, and is still the trademark gray ULAE uses today.http://www.ulae.com/marycallary/index.aspx Architect Philip Johnson, whom she had met her in Paris, became a close friend, and he introduced her to major players in the world of business and art in New York, including Nelson and Abby Rockefeller. Wallace Harrison, who along with Johnson, was responsible for the design of Lincoln Center, commissioned Callery to create a sculpture for the top of the proscenium arch at the Metropolitan Opera House. Described as \\"an untitled ensemble of bronze forms creating a bouquet of sculptured arabesques,\\" it is perhaps her best known work. It is most affectionately known by The Metropolitan Opera Company members as \\"The Car Wreck\\" and more infrequently as \\"Spaghetti Spoon in Congress with Plumbers Strap.\\" She was represented by the prestigious art dealers M. Knoedler & Co. and the Curt Valentin Gallery, and she exhibited in more than twenty noteworthy solo and group exhibitions. She became an acquaintance of Georgia O'Keeffe and in 1945 made a sculpture of O'Keeffe's head. In 1945, she was invited to join the summer faculty of Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where she taught alongside Josef Albers, Robert Motherwell, Lyonel Feininger, and Walter Gropius.  Personal life  In 1923, she married Frederic R. Coudert Jr., lawyer (and future member of Congress). They had one daughter, Caroline, born in 1926. Mary sought a divorce from Coudert in 1930 and in 1931 married Italian textile industrialist and fine art collector Carlo Frua de Angeli. This second marriage also ended in divorce. Following the beginning of the Second World War, she carried on a romantic relationship with architect Mies van der Rohe who designed an artist's studio for her in Huntington, on Long Island, New York.  Later life and death  In her later years, Callery maintained studios in New York, Huntington, Long Island, and Paris. She died on February 12, 1977 at the American Hospital of Paris.

The show debuted on June 2, 2008, on Jetix in Europe, June 9, 2008, in the United States and in Asia on May 3, 2008. It premiered on YTV in Canada. 52 episodes were produced. Premise This show is about three 12 year old pre-teens and an alien pre-teen girl, who are all charged with saving their town from alien invasions. They reform a secret organization that was founded centuries ago called the Monster Buster Club, often abbreviated to MBC. The goal of the MBC is to locate alien criminals seeking refuge in Single Town, capture them, and send them to galactic authorities. Setting The show takes place in a small calm town named Single Town. Single Town is two hundred years old and was founded by a man named Addison Single (who was really an alien disguised as a human). Unbeknownst to its human inhabitants, Single Town is actually a meeting place for aliens from different parts of the galaxy. Episodes Characters Main *Cathy Smith (voiced by Andrea Libman) ‚Äì Cathy appears to be a bubbly, 12-year-old girl on Earth, but she is actually a 250-year-old (or 700 Rapzodian year-old teenager) alien from the planet Rapzodia.

She has many alien abilities, like the ability to stretch, slight telekinesis, and others. She is the most optimistic of the MBC. Her suit color is pink. In her human form, she has blond hair and blue eyes. Her Rapzodian form is shown to be a humanoid, white alien with scattered pink spots, with four tentacles for arms, and two tentacles for legs, as well as tentacles on her head, (like hair), and a long, furry-looking tailIn one episode, Cathy mentions that her alien form has tentacles, and later on her full alien form is revealed.

The term \\"Jewish Kalam\\" is used by modern historians, but is not a term by which Jewish thinkers designated themselves. In all likelihood, they were simply known by the Arabic term Mutakallim≈´n \\"Kalamists\\", as they are referred to by Maimonides and other Jewish writers. The best known practitioner of Jewish Kalam was Saadia Gaon, and Jewish Kalam represented the philosophical battlefield upon which Saadia attacked the proponents of Karaite Judaism. Maimonides in his The Guide for the Perplexed frequently references and disputes positions of Kalam, both Jewish and Muslim, and in general conveys an opinion of Kalam that is highly uncomplimentary. Judah Halevi also makes reference to Jewish followers of the Kalam, but mentions only Karaite Jews. Basic principles of Jewish Kalam Some of the basic principles of the Jewish Kalam are as follow . See also Maimonides's characterization of the principles below. * Observation of the natural world reveals the existence of a Creator * The world/universe must have been created ex nihilo rather than from preexisting matter * The Creator is absolutely different from anything in the created world * The Creator is a perfect unity, with no division * Human moral criteria can be applied to God. To say God is \\"wise\\" or God is \\"good\\" is to apply those terms meaningfully, and their meaning is related to the mundane meaning of those terms (cf. Maimonides) Maimonides' characterization Maimonides refers repeatedly to the Mutakallim≈´n (Kalam philosophers) in The Guide for the Perplexed . Some examples of his characterization of Kalamic thought can be found at the end of Book I (Chapters 73‚Äì76).see also Maimonides continues in that section to provide a history of Kalamic thought, its sources and subsequent development, and then proceeds to condemn a certain laxity of thought to be found in this philosophical school. In particular, Maimonides takes strong issue with the Kalamic proof of God's existence and unity from the Creation of the World in time. While Maimonides himself does regard the world as having been created ex nihilo (rather than being eternally existing, as Aristotle would have it; see GP, Book II Chapter 25, for example), Maimonides also considers this proposition as being far from obvious, and in all likelihood not susceptible to proof. He thus regards the Kalamic approach as starting from a position of convenience rather than from an irrefutable premise, and their methodology as being entirely tainted by their eagerness to produce certain results which support their prior beliefs. Additionally he considers their premises to \\"run counter to the nature of existence that is perceived.\\" He writes that \\"every one of their premises, with few exceptions, is contradicted by what is perceived of the nature of that which exists, so that doubts come up with regard to them.\\" However, it can be noted below, that in many cases the Kalamists were indeed more prescient than Maimonides himself in their beliefs regarding the discrete nature of matter, existence of vacuum, and other physical characteristics of the natural world. Principles of Kalam according to Maimonides In Book I Chapter 73, Maimonides presents the 12 premises of the Mutakallim≈´n, and disputes most of them. The premises are, in brief, as follow: # Existence of atoms: The world is composed of small particles which are not divisible, and which have no identifying essential properties (only accidents). # Existence of vacuum: There exist certain spaces which are devoid of all substance and material. # Time is discrete: Time is made up of fundamental instants which are not themselves subject to further division. # Every body is subject to accidents: Any body must have either an accident (non-essential feature) or its opposite. A body cannot be without accidents. # These accidents exist in the atom. # An atom has one-instant duration: An atom does not persist (its accidents do not persist) more than one moment of time. God must repeatedly create these accidents at each time instant, or they permanently go out of existence. # Accidents in bodies also do not persist and must be recreated. This and the previous principle constitute a denial of causality. # Only substance and accident exist: Bodies differ only in regard to their accidents. # Accidents subsist in a common substratum: An accident cannot subsist in another accident. # Any state of affairs which can be imagined is admissible in intellectual argument. # All kinds of infinity are impossible. # The senses may be in error: The senses should not be trusted in matters of demonstration. Not all of these principles were elements of the Jewish Kalam as practiced by particular thinkers. For example, atomism was a principle embraced by earlier Karaite Jews but not by the Geonim or later Karaites. Harry Austryn Wolfson, in his study on the Jewish Kalam, considers it doubtful whether any Jewish thinkers ever embraced the denial of causality. Arguments of Kalam according to Maimonides In Book I Chapter 74, Maimonides reproduces the seven methods by which the Mutakallim≈´n demonstrate that the world is created in time. In Chapter 75, Maimonides reproduces the five methods by which the Mutakallim≈´n demonstrate the unity of God. In Chapter 76, Maimonides reproduces the three methods by which the Mutakallim≈´n demonstrate the incorporeality of God. Needless to say, Maimonides finds most of these methods to be philosophically inadequate and na√Øve. Jewish Kalam personalities Among the personalities associated with the Jewish Kalam are the following, many of whom were Karaites: Rabbinites * Saadia Gaon * Hai Gaon * David ibn Merwan al-Mukkamas * Samuel ben Hofni :Note: Jewish Kalam is adopted by the Rabbinite Academies of Kairouan, Fustat, Lucena, Toledo and C√≥rdoba as the Babylonian Jewish Academies in Sura, Pumbedita, Basra and Baghdad closed and transferred their intellectual and religious heritage to al-Andalus. Karaites * Jacob Qirqisani * Yefet ben Ali * Jeshua ben Judah * Daniel al-Kumisi * Joseph ben Abraham * Jeshua ben Judah * Judah Hadassi Because the composition of written works was yet uncommon at the time that the Jewish Kalam flourished, there are few surviving books from this era. Instead, what we have are selected quotes and paraphrases such as found in Maimonides and Saadia, but mostly we have what Wolfson calls \\"mere names,\\" individuals who are identified as prominent Kalamic thinkers but who left no evidence of their work or lives. Wolfson provides a list of some of these \\"mere names.\\" He also suggests that all the Jewish thinkers of this period were likely referred to as Mutakallim≈´n, as suggested by references from Moses ibn Ezra and others. Legacy of the Kalam Jewish Kalamic thought had influences on many later Jewish philosophers, including Judah Halevi, Joseph ibn Tzaddik, Bahya ibn Paquda, and Maimonides, who criticized it vigorously. Many of the works of the Jewish Kalamists were not translated from Arabic into Mishnaic Hebrew, and so their influence greatly diminished as the Golden Age of Arabic-language Jewish scholarship drew to a close.

Magn√∫s Eir√≠ksson (22 June 1806 in Skinnal√≥n (Nor√∞ur-√ûingeyjars√Ωsla), Iceland ‚Äì 3 July 1881 in Copenhagen, Denmark) was an Icelandic theologian and a contemporary critic of S√∏ren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813‚Äì1855) and Hans Lassen Martensen (1808‚Äì1884) in Copenhagen. Due to his very critical attitude towards the church dogma, especially the dogmas of the Trinity of God and the Divinity of Christ, in contrast to which he stressed (at least in his late work) the essential unity of God and the leadership of Jesus (merely) as prophet and teacher, Eir√≠ksson often was labeled as a ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù or ‚Äúprecursor‚Äù See e.g. √Åg√∫st H. Bjarnason, \\"Magnus Eiriksson, the first Icelandic Unitarian\\" (Lecture at Harvard Divinity School, May 21, 1923; handwritten manuscript); Stephen H. Fritchman, Men of Liberty.

Magn√∫s Eir√≠ksson (approx. 1876) Signature of Magn√∫s Eir√≠ksson Skinnal√≥n, Parish of √Åsmundarsta√∞ir, Nor√∞ur-√ûingeyjars√Ωsla (D. Dankel) Childhood and study of theology Magn√∫s Eir√≠ksson was born the eldest of the five children of Eir√≠kur Gr√≠msson (‚Ä† 1812), a farmer, and √ûorbj√∂rg Steph√°nsd√≥ttir (‚Ä† 1841), a pastor's daughter, in Skinnal√≥n, Nor√∞ur- √ûingeyjars√Ωsla, on the northeastern tip of Iceland. In 1831, he left for Copenhagen to take the university entrance examination. He then remained in Copenhagen until his death in 1881. Eir√≠ksson studied theology at the University of Copenhagen, where he was deeply influenced by Professor Henrik Nicolai Clausen (1793‚Äì1877), who represented a form of theological rationalism which appealed to him.Cf. Eir√≠ksson‚Äôs own portrayal of this time in his work Om Baptister og Barnedaab, Copenhagen 1844, pp. III ‚Äì XIII. After obtaining his degree in 1837, Eir√≠ksson became a tutor to theology students (manudukt√∏r), among whom he enjoyed considerable popularity. Eir√≠ksson‚Äôs relations to Martensen and Kierkegaard (1844-1850) Eir√≠ksson as an opponent of Martensen Unlike to Clausen's rationalism, Eir√≠ksson was very critical to H. L. Martensen's speculative theology, which he violently attacked in various publications from 1844 to 1850. His basic point was that faith was based on reason, and ‚Äúonly that which can be accepted by reason can and should be accepted by faith‚Äù.Tro, Overtro og Vantro, Copenhagen 1846, p. 93ff Martensen refused to become involved in polemic with Eir√≠ksson, and remained completely silent. This silence so irritated Eir√≠ksson that in 1847 he wrote a letter to King Christian VII denouncing Martensen's silence as ‚Äúinexcusable, dishonest and dishonorable‚Äù Speculativ Rettroenhed, Copenhagen 1849, p. II. and demanding that Martensen be relieved of his professorship at Copenhagen University. His accusations against Martensen were violent and uncontrolled, but at the same time he also attacked the Government's alleged absolutism. As a result, the public prosecutor was ordered to institute proceedings against him. With the king's death in 1848, however, and the general amnesty which accompanied his successor, Frederik VII's, accession to the throne, these were dropped. Eir√≠ksson's attack on Martensen harmed himself most, particularly financially, as the students, in sympathy with their famous professor, stopped using Eir√≠ksson as a tutor. His financial situation became particularly bad, and he (at least) twice wrote to S√∏ren Kierkegaard asking for help, but Kierkegaard refused.Cf. Breve og Aktstykker vedr. S√∏ren Kierkegaard, vol. 1, pp. 181-183 (no. 163 and 164) as well as Kierkegaard‚Äôs draft ‚ÄúA Little Explanation‚Äù in Pap. VIII-2 B 175-176. Eir√≠ksson as an unwelcome ally of Kierkegaard In his attack on speculative theology, and especially on Martensen's, Eir√≠ksson thought he had an ally in S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Kierkegaard's Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846) supported him in this claim. Kierkegaard, however, vigorously protested against this ‚Äúunauthorized acknowledgment‚Äù of his writings by ‚Äúthat raging Roland‚Äù and accused Eir√≠ksson of attributing to him motives of which there is not a trace in the book.See Kierkegaard‚Äôs journal entry \\"Self-defense against unauthorized acknowledgment\\" in Pap. VII-1 B 88. Regarding Eir√≠ksson's efforts to get Martensen dismissed, Kierkegaard comments: ‚ÄúAnd with the violence and force of the Devil he has involved my ‚ÄòConcluding Unscientific Postscript‚Äô in his ... campaign. ... I do not know either whether M.E. has read the book. But if he has read it, I do know that he has absolutely, mendaciously and presumptuously misunderstood it‚Äù Pap. VII-1 B 88, p. 289, transl. by H. Hong in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Princeton 1992, vol. 2 (suppl.), p. 128. In 1850 Eir√≠ksson published pseudonymously [Theophilus Nicolaus] his book Er Troen et Paradox og ‚Äòi Kraft af det Absurde‚Äô? [Is Faith a Paradox and ‚Äòby Virtue of the Absurd‚Äô?] where he criticized Kierkegaard's account of faith. Eir√≠ksson declared that faith must not be made into a paradox, for ‚Äúwhen faith is genuine and strong, it has its firm base and deep root in the immediate intellectual faculty in man, which we call reason.‚Äù Er Troen et Paradox og ‚Äòi Kraft af det Absurde‚Äô?, Copenhagen 1850, p. 23. Faith understood as a paradox ‚Äúannuls and destroys all independent thought.‚Äù Er Troen et Paradox og ‚Äòi Kraft af det Absurde‚Äô?', op. cit., p. 46. In his (albeit unpublished) answer to Theophilus Nicolaus, alias Eir√≠ksson, Kierkegaard claims that Eir√≠ksson has completely misunderstood his works and quite overlooked their main concern. In his zeal to prove that faith was not in any way a paradox, Eir√≠ksson ‚Äì according to Kierkegaard ‚Äì had lost Christianity: ‚ÄúBoth the paradox and Christianity, jointly and separately, vanished completely‚Äù.Pap. X-6 B 68, p. 75 / H. and E. Hong, Kierkegaard‚Äôs Journals and Papers, vol. 6, no. 6598, cf. p. 302: ‚Äûyou did superbly well: both the paradox and Christianity, jointly and separately, vanished completely.\\" Therefore, instead of inviting Kierkegaard to ‚Äútake up that matter of the paradox‚Äù again, Eir√≠ksson should himself first take up Christianity which, in his zeal, he had lost.Pap.

Eir√≠ksson remained silent in the period 1850‚Äì1863. In these years he went through a spiritual crisis. He came to see clearly that the Church's doctrine that God became man in and through Jesus Christ had to be rejected, for it would have the result of leading to the deification of man. German biblical criticism and, in particular, the influence of the T√ºbingen School caused him to break radically with Johannine and Pauline theology. In J√∏der og Christne [Jews and Christians] (1871) Eir√≠ksson drew the ultimate conclusion and explained that Judaism, which in his terminology meant an immediate childlike trust in God, was the only true religion. Jesus had only wanted to purify Judaism, and it is to purified Judaism that we must return. In the face of the continuing silence of \\"the professionals\\", a number of laypeople with religious interests, such as the religious author Andreas Daniel Pedrin (1823‚Äì1891) and the postal supervisor and author J√∏rgen Christian Theodor Faber (1824‚Äì1886), felt called to take a public stand against Eir√≠ksson's views.See A.D. Pedrin, Vor Herres og Frelsers Jesu Christi nye Testament og Magnus Eirikssons reformeerte J√∏dedom, Copenhagen 1874 and J.C.T. Faber, Aabent Brev til Danmarks Theologer om Nyrationalismens Forhold til den kristne Tro, Copenhagen 1871 In Denmark, on the whole, Eir√≠ksson's late writings provoked a wide spectrum of reactions. These ranged in tone from radical rejection at one extreme, to open professions of sympathy for Eir√≠ksson and his message at the other end. In his native Iceland, however, Eir√≠ksson's reception was almost uniformly harsh. There his much-discussed book The Gospel of John (1863) sparked fierce controversy: not only theologians like Sigur√∞ur Melste√∞ (1819‚Äì1895),See e.g. Melste√∞‚Äôs critical review of Eir√≠ksson‚Äôs J√≥hannesar gu√∞spjall og L√¶rd√≥mur kirkjunnar um gu√∞, nokkrar athugasemdir til yfirvegunar √ûeim √çslend√≠ngum, sem ekki vilja sv√≠vir√∞a og lasta gu√∞ me√∞ tr√∫ sinni, Copenhagen 1865 [Eir√≠ksson‚Äôs Icelandic extract from his book Er Johannes-Evangeliet et apostolisk og √¶gte Evangelium (1863)], in √ûj√≥√∞√≥lfur 17 (1864/65), nos. 29.31-32.35-36.42-43.45-46 and 47-48) but also the Catholic priests Jean-Baptiste Baudoin (1831‚Äì1875) and Bernard Bernard (1821‚Äì1895)See the section \\"Catholic revival\\" in the article \\"Religion in Iceland\\". felt compelled to take a stand against him. In Sweden, by contrast, Eir√≠ksson's thought found more fertile soil‚Äîthanks above all to the \\"freethinking pastor\\" Nils Johan Ekdahl (1799‚Äì1870), who translated two of Eir√≠ksson's books into Swedish.See Johannis Evangelium. √Ñr det en √§kta apostolisk bok och √§r dess l√§ra: att Gud √§r vorden menniska, en sann och kristlig l√§ra?

(1863)] It is not by chance that, in 1877, Eir√≠ksson's final publications appeared in Swedish newspapers and periodicals‚Äìmost prominently in the journal Sanningss√∂karen [\\"The Truth-Seeker\\"]. Had Eir√≠ksson's supporters and friends not arranged a modest annuity to supplement his state pension, Eir√≠ksson would surely have suffered acute financial distress during his final years. In mid-1878, Eir√≠ksson was even provided with funds to make a brief return to Iceland, but his failing health made such a visit impossible. After his death on July 3, 1881, at Frederiks Hospital in Copenhagen, Eir√≠ksson's friends set up a mounted bust on his grave in Garnisons Kirkeg√•rd.

Foundations Phase congruency reflects the behaviour of the image in the frequency domain. It has been noted that edgelike features have many of their frequency components in the same phase. The concept is similar to coherence, except that it applies to functions of different wavelength. For example, the Fourier decomposition of a square wave consists of sine functions, whose frequencies are odd multiples of the fundamental frequency. At the rising edges of the square wave, each sinusoidal component has a rising phase; the phases have maximal congruency at the edges. This corresponds to the human-perceived edges in an image where there are sharp changes between light and dark. Definition Phase congruency compares the weighted alignment of the Fourier components of a signal A_{\\\\rm n} with the sum of the Fourier components. :PC(t) = \\\\max_{\\\\bar{\\\\phi}} \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{\\\\rm n} A_{\\\\rm n} \\\\cos(\\\\phi_{\\\\rm n}(t)-\\\\bar\\\\phi)}{\\\\sum_{\\\\rm n}A_n} where \\\\phi_{\\\\rm n} is the local or instantaneous phase as can be calculated using the Hilbert transform and A_{\\\\rm n} are the local amplitude, or energy, of the signal. When all the phases are aligned, this is equal to 1. Advantages The square-wave example is naive in that most edge detection methods deal with it equally well. For example, the first derivative has a maximal magnitude at the edges. However, there are cases where the perceived edge does not have a sharp step or a large derivative. The method of phase congruency applies to many cases where other methods fail. A notable example is an image feature consisting of a single line, such as the letter \\"l\\". Many edge-detection algorithms will pick up two adjacent edges: the transitions from white to black, and black to white. On the other hand, the phase congruency map has a single line. A simple Fourier analogy of this case is a triangle wave. In each of its crests there is a congruency of crests from different sinusoidal functions. Disadvantages Calculating the phase congruency map of an image is very computationally intensive, and sensitive to image noise. Techniques of noise reduction are usually applied prior to the calculation.

Wile E. then puts on an ACME Batman Outfit and dives off a cliff, attempting to fly. After that debacle, he perches himself upon a high branch with an anvil attached to the end of an ACME Rubber Band. He also tries attaching a stick of dynamite to a telescoping device, paints a landscape on a stone wall, mines a bridge with explosives, and crafts a makeshift jet bike. In the end, as he starts to fall down to the ground after another unsuccessful attempt, he holds a sign saying, \\"How about ending this cartoon before I hit?\\" His wish is obliged, and as the cartoon irises out, he holds another sign saying, \\"Thank you.\\" See also *Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1950‚Äì1959) References External links * Category:1956 films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:American short films Category:American films Category:1956 animated films Category:Short films directed by Chuck Jones Category:Wile E.

History Certina was founded in 1888 when Adolf and Alfred Kurth opened in Grenchen their first movement and supplies factory for the watchmaking industry. At the start Certina's staff consisted of three employees working in a workshop that was connected to the family home. Certina did not begin producing complete watches and timepieces for a few years which they then did alongside their work producing movements for other companies. By 1938 the company had expanded and 250 employees celebrated the 50th anniversary of the company.. Certina continued to expand and by 1955 the company had 500 employees working between the factory and offices, producing 1,000 timepieces every day. Certina worked up a new business plan that expanded its operations.. By 1972 Certina employed 900 people and produced 600,000 watches every year. 1983 Certina became a member of the SMH Group (Swatch).  Affiliation to General Watch Co, Allgemeine Gesellschaft der schweizerischen Uhrenindustrie AG (ASUAG) In 1971, the owning family opted to join General Watch Co, the newly created sub-holding of ASUAG, in order to consolidate their efforts with others. The introduction of cheap and reliable automatics and Quartz watches from Japan (under the rules of their strategic management: see Strategic management ) stopped Certina's expansion. The restructuring involved the abandonment of their own manufacture of Certina calibres, and by the end of the 1970s, Certina operations were moved to Biel/Bienne and the entity Edox & Technos. Under the new management, Certina managed to hold on to some of their properties, especially in the Scandinavian countries. Upon the merger of SSIH and ASUAG companies, Certina became a member of a new managerial entity, together with Mido and Tissot, which became known as Le Locle, (the newly elected Unesco World Heritage Site in Switzerland ).  Wristwatches, World‚Äôs First & Lines of Collection  * The first wristwatches : were already produced by the company in 1938 : predominately ladies watches, because men still preferred pocket watches. * Digital Watch: 1936 Certina was the first company to produce a digital watch. It was driven by a spring movement. Rotating disks bearing inscribed numbers were used to display the time, instead of hands. * DS (Double Security) Line: In 1959 Hans and Edwin Kurth set themselves the objective of creating a new marketplace niche based on quality through engineering and technical design. Thus Certina created the concept of suspending the watch movement inside a highly reinforced case, which they named DS for \\"Double Security\\". The Certina DS were the first watches to increase shock protection and water resistance to 6 m (previous watches were set at 2.2 meters). The Certina DS watch was taken up the Himalayas by a team who climbed the Dhaulagiri and the watch withstood all changes in pressure and altitude. * Biostar: In 1971 Certina introduced the Biostar, the world's first watch that displayed human biorhythms. * \\"Scratchproof\\" : Certina went on to produce many world firsts, including the \\"unscratchable\\" DS-DiaMaster in tungsten carbide.

It currently offers collections, classified under the names \\"Automatic\\", \\"SPORT Classic\\", \\"SPORT Elegant\\" and \\"SPORT Xtreme\\", including some models claimed to perform up to 300 m underwater.  Motoring Sponsoring & Partnerships  The 2000s (decade) saw many new partnerships with motoring companies including Colin McRae, Sete Gibernau, Sauber Formula One team. Certina was timekeeper of the Motorcycling Grand Prix in the 1990s. Certina sponsors the 2014 World Rally Championship. The Certina brand In 1906 the Certina brand name was used for the first time, with Adolf and Alfred choosing to call their watches \\"Grana\\", the short form of \\"Granatus\\", the Latin name for Grenchen. In 1938 the company adopted the name \\"Certina\\", taken from the Latin \\"certus\\", meaning \\"assured\\", \\"certain\\", as their trademark for the export and marketing of their watches. In 2014 Certina changed their red logo with a new logo. The new logo uses a turtle symbol, to symbolize protection against water and shocks. The change in logo and brand colours was because Certina wanted to move to a more expensive and higher quality segment. Differentiating it from Tissot, another brand in the Swatch Group family. The impact of the changes in the brand has been the integration of better and more accurate movements like the PreciDrive in new releases.

Folding doors are also known as ‚Äòbi-fold doors', in spite of them most often having more than two panels. Another term is ‚Äòconcertina‚Äô doors, inspired by the musical instrument of the same name. Folding doors can be used as internal or external room dividers and are made from a variety of materials. Most folding doors are glazed and the panels have frames of either wood, aluminium or upvc. They can open up and fold either internally or externally and are widely used in modern extensions. Opposed to a conventional door with a standard aperture of 700-900 mm, most modern folding door (sets) can be up to several meters in width, and thereby considerably increase both physical and visual accessibility between either two internal rooms or an internal room and an outside space. Historically folding doors were already known by the Romans as excavations in Pompeii have revealed. Peter Connolly writes in his book ‚ÄòPompeii‚Äô that the Romans ‚Äòdisliked single-leaf doors and wherever possible, both inside and out, they used double or even folding doors‚Äô.

They have specialized in the manufacture of articulated light dump trucks and earth moving equipment. A variety of models are produced, with a payload of up to 20 tonnes. Since 1996 they are also producing a mine clearing vehicle. A company subsidiary with production is operating in Weimar, Germany.  History  In 1959 Aksel Kyed and Kjeld W. Jensen started the company \\"Kyed and Werner Jensen\\", which at that time were involved in two different projects, district heating and the fabrication of hydraulic digging equipment. In 1960 the company was split, and Kjeld W. Jensen started Hydrema. Back then the headquarters were placed in Aalborg. In 1962 the company moved to St√∏vring. At that time Hydrema had 15 workers and an area of 320 m¬≤. In 1971 a daughter company was established in Norway, followed by Sweden in 1979, the former West Germany in 1981, England in 1985 and France in 1988. There are many countries like the United States, Australia and Poland, that import machines from the Hydrema factories in Denmark and from 1997 Germany. In 1980 Hydrema started producing their own machines from the bottom. It started with the Hydrema 800-series, which were a new line of backhoe loaders produced all by themselves. But the engines were made by Perkins Engines in England (Today most machines are fitted with Cummins engines, though). Before 1980, Hydrema bought tractors from companies like Volvo, so they could mount their own hydraulic equipment on the tractors. In 1983 Hydrema started producing their own dump trucks and in a short period in the late 1980s they also produced mobile building cranes. In 1990 the Hydrema 800-series were replaced by the Hydrema 900-series which had a new chassis and more powerful axles and digging arm (backhoe). Hydrema mine clearing vehicle In 1996 Hydrema started the production of a new mine clearing vehicle, named the Hydrema MCV 910. It can safely clear big mine areas in a short time. In 1997 Hydrema bought the Weimar-Werk Baumaschinen and thereby got production facilities in Germany. In St√∏vring, the production and administration area is about 16.500 m¬≤, while the facilities in Weimar are 20.000 m¬≤. In 1998 Hydrema launched their unique Hydrema MPV 900. It is a Multi Purpose Vehicle, which is able to switch whole tools, like a telescopic arm or a digging arm. In 2004, Hydrema mine-clearing vehicle (MCV) was used by the Indian Army for 'proving' operations to clear personnel or anti-tank mines with up to 10 kg explosive weight. In 2006 Hydrema expanded into the defence industry through a counter purchasing deal with the Swedish H√§gglunds, which is a part of BAE Systems. Hydrema was to produce, mount and integrate 45 turrets for the Danish Army's new CV9035 Infantry Fighting Vehicle.

Pre-Federation: 1830s‚Äì1901 'Podgy', a Sikh hawker in Goulburn Valley, Victoria It is difficult to separate the history of early Sikh arrival to Australia from that of the numerous other religious faiths that were represented the people of British India and more specifically the Punjab province. It appears that the first Sikhs arrived in the country somewhere in the late 1830s, when the penal transport of convicts to New South Wales (which at the time also consisted of Queensland and Victoria) was slowing, before being abolished altogether in 1840. The lack of manual labourers from the convict assignment system led to an increase demand for foreign labour, which was partly filled by the arrival of Sikhs. The Sikhs came from an agrarian background in India, and thus fulfilled their tasks as farm labourers on cane fields and shepherds on sheep stations well. \\"Initially, the migrants from India were indentured labourers, who worked on sheep stations and farms around Australia. Some adventurers followed during the gold rush of the 1850s. A census from 1861 indicates that there were around 200 Indians in Victoria of whom 20 were in Ballarat, the town which was at the epicenter of the gold rush. Thereafter, many more came and worked as hawkers - going from house to house, town to town, traversing thousands of kilometers, making a living by selling a variety of products.\\"Early Sikhs in Australia, SikhChic.com. From the 1860s onwards, cameleers, commonly called 'Ghans' were brought to Australia to help explore and settle Australia's vast arid interior. While the Ghans consisted mainly of Muslims from largely from British India and some even from Afghanistan and Egypt, a sizeable minority were Sikhs from Punjab. The Ghans set up camel- breeding stations and rest house outposts, known as caravanserai, throughout inland Australia, creating a permanent link between the coastal cities and the remote cattle and sheep grazing stations until about the 1930s, when they were largely replaced by the automobile. Towards the end of the 19th century, Indian hawkers, many of whom were Sikh, became a common sight in the country regions throughout the country. Peddling was a common occupation in rural India and was readily transplanted to rural Australia, due to its widely dispersed population. Hawking required little capital to begin, with young men travelling on foot until they had enough money to purchase a horse and cart. The hawking system was based on credit, with warehouses selling goods to Indian wholesalers on credit, who provided the hawkers their stock on credit, who in turn sold their goods to the farmers and farmhands on credit. Credit was vital as money was often only available after the harvesting of the crops. The hawkers sold a wide variety of goods from work wear and farming goods for the men of the household, to fashionable clothing, trinkets and sewing needles for the wives and daughters. All hawkers required licenses issued by the state and from the 1890s licenses started to become restricted to British subjects. This denied Afghans, Assyrians and Chinese from renewing their license, giving the Sikhs a monopoly on hawking which they held until the 1930s when new European migrants began to ply the trade. While the hawkers were usually well received by the people of the country, with many stories of the hawkers cooking curries with the wives and playing cricket with the men, their success worried some politicians. Sikh hawkers sent some of their profits back to their families in the villages of Punjab and invested the rest by building stores and buying land, especially in northern New South Wales, where their continued acquisition caused the minister for of lands, Niel Nielson, to speak out. Two of the most successful Sikh hawkers were Baba Ram Singh and Otim (Uttam) Singh who arrived in 1890 learnt the trade and prospered and in 1907 they established \\"The People Stores\\". Baba Ram Singh lived to be 106 and is thought to have brought the first Guru Granth Sahib to Australia in the early 1920s, while in his lifetime Otim Singh acquired ¬£10,000 and developed a thriving business on Kangaroo Island.http://epress.anu.edu.au/anu_lives/transnational/mobile_devices/ch03.html As their families were not allowed to join these early pioneers many travelled back and forth finally returning to their original homeland to retire.http://www.sikh.com.au/inaus/index.html Some of the earliest arrivals in Australia, whose families / offspring continue to live in Australia.

Today many Sikhs live in the town of Woolgoolga (roughly half way between Sydney and Brisbane on the highway. These people have their own Banana Farms and are quite rich. Their riches have come by hard work. There are two Sikh temples in Woolgoolga. One of them even has a Museum on Sikhism. Many British and Anglo Indians who were born in India migrated to Australia after 1947. These British citizens decided to settle in Australia in large numbers but are still counted as 'Indian' Nationals in the Census. You will be surprised to find that a full blooded Australian looking old man will whisper to you in Hindi or Urdu. The third wave of Indians came about 25 years ago, just after Australia abandoned its Whites Only policy in 1973. Yes, this is a little known fact that Australia until recently was a whites only country. This policy was abolished in 1973 and many Teachers and Doctors came to settle in Australia. Another big influx began with the silicon chi revolution. Large number of Indian Computer Software professional started arriving in Australia from 1973 onwards. Today it is hard to go to an IT shop and not find a few Indians working there. Certificate of Exemption to the Dictation Test ‚Äì CEDT Many of the early Sikh pioneers obtained Certificates exempting them from a dictation test, that non-whites had to undergo if they wanted to enter Australia after 1901. However, it is not known how the Sikhs that entered for the first time after 1901 continued to or were permitted to reside and work in Australia. There is an apparent lack of understanding about the roll that the Certificate of Exemption to the Dictation Test (CEDT) played during the period that the ‚ÄúImmigration Restriction Act 1901‚Äù known as the ‚ÄúWhite Australia Policy‚Äù was operating. The Dictation Test was a written test in any European language chosen at random by the Migration Officers. It was primarily designed to keep non-white people from entering Australia. However, any Indian or other non-white person who was resident in Australia before 1900, could, if they chose to leave Australia, leave after applying for the CEDT, which would ensure that they could return to Australia at a time of their choosing and not undergo a Dictation Test. Many people of all nationalities left Australia and re-entered Australia and experienced little difficulty re-entering Australia. An example is Braham Singh who was a hawker in the Warrnambool District, Victoria and after being a resident in Australia for 29 years in 1928 (i.e. came to Australia in 1899) applied for, and obtained a CEDT and then travelled to India initially for 3 years but extended this period to 10 years and returned to Australia in 1938, without any problems. CREDIT to \\"Australian Indian History\\" (Len Kenna & Crystal Jordan) for this clarification. During the White Australia Policy: 1901‚Äì1973 Sikh troops washing their clothes in the surf at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli Peninsula RAAF Personnel with a Sikh man during WWII From federation in 1901 until the 1973 immigration of non-whites, including Sikhs, into Australia was restricted due to the enactment of the White Australia policy. The laws made it impossible for Sikhs to enter the country unless they were merchants or students, who themselves were only allowed in for short periods of time; it also made it impossible for Sikhs who already lived in the country from returning to the motherland, as they would be barred re-entry. Historians place the number of Indians in Australia at federation in 1901 somewhere between 4700 and 7600. According to the 1911 census, there was only 3698 'Indians' (mostly Sikh) signifying a large decrease, with the trend continuing, with only approximately 2200 'Indians' in the country in 1921. Open discrimination of non-whites before the passing of the laws was also widespread. After the conclusion of World War I, however, the stance of Australia on Sikhs shifted. Sikhs were classified as a martial race by the officials of the British Empire, who believed they were brave, loyal and well- built for fighting. As such they were preferentially recruited to the British armed forces as part of the Sikh Regiment, which quickly became the most decorated regiment in the Empire. They fought side by side with the ANZAC battalions in the battle of Gallipoli and earned the respect of many Australians. This combined the need to strengthen links to counter the growing threat of an expansionist and industrialised Japan saw Indians of Australia given rights far greater than that of other Asian groups through a series of steps between 1925 and 1929, Indians in Australia were allowed limited property rights, were given the right to vote and allowed a pension. The Sikhs began to use their new-found rights in the 1930s when the early pioneers begun to bring their 'sons of working age' to Australia. Initially they had a strong presence in the Atherton Tableland region of Queensland and the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, especially Maclean, Harwood and Clarence, where they worked as manual labourers, mainly working on the sugar cane fields, but also finding work in other industries such as the construction of railways. During World War II, Australia suffered from a dearth of labourers as the White population was recruited into the army and sent overseas, where they fought side by side with the Sikhs in the Battle of Malaya, Battle of Singapore and numerous other hostilities. This allowed Indians to work in many agricultural sectors which they had previously been barred from working in due to protests by agricultural unions. One of the opened industries was the banana industry, leading to the Sikhs in Australia migrating from to the banana growing areas of Woolgoolga to fill the shortage, forming a Sikh community that still exists to this day. The Partition of India occurred in 1947, with the state of Punjab, the home to the majority of the Sikh community in Australia, being divided between the Islamic Pakistan in the west, and the Secular Hindu, Sikh, Muslim India in the east. As a result of the upheaval, many of the Sikh father and sons returned to the Punjab to protect their family, assets and land from the turmoil, however many of them arrived back in Punjab to find that they had lost everything. Those young and fit enough to still work in Australia returned, mainly to work on the banana farms in Woolgoolga, although some ended up working in Northern Queensland. In the 1950s and '60s the Sikhs worked hard and started to purchase land and start their own banana farms. With steady work and income, the Sikh men started to bring their wives from Punjab to Australia. In 1961 there were six Sikh women in Woolgoolga, creating Sikh households and Sikh children born in Australia. As Indians were allowed naturalisation, the first true Sikh Australians came into being. The pull of the Sikh community in Woolgoolga led to Sikhs from other areas of the country migrating to Woolgoolga in the hope they could follow their kinsmen to a banana led success. In 1968 the First Sikh Temple was opened in Woolgoolga, becoming the first Gurdwara to be opened in the country.Verne A. Dusenbery, Rashmere Bhatti: A Punjabi Sikh Community in Australia ‚Äì from Indian Sojourners to Australian Citizens Post White Australia Policy: 1973‚ÄìPresent With the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act by the Whitlam government, Sikh migration to Australia dramatically increased. While most Sikh immigrants can trace their heritage to Punjab, many come from countries other than India including Malaysia, Singapore, Fiji, Kenya, Uganda and the United Kingdom. Sikhs migrate to Australia because it is a free stable country with economic opportunities. In many cases Sikhs suffered injustices in their home country, and in the case of Uganda, open persecution. Whereas early immigration was mainly as labourers working in the country, new migrants are now mainly based around the major cities, working in a variety of fields from driving taxis to health professionals. Melbourne is now home to the largest Sikh population. Since 2000, there has been a great increase in the number of Sikh students studying in Australia, with many staying on in the country after the completion of their studies. In May and June 2009, a number of Sikhs fell victim to a spate of attacks on Indians studying in the country, leading to protests in Melbourne and Sydney. According to the , the Sikh population numbered 125,909 individuals, of whom 39% live in Greater Melbourne, 21% in Greater Sydney, and 10% in Greater Brisbane. The states and territories with the highest proportion of Sikhs are Victoria (0.89%) and the Australian Capital Territory (0.54%), whereas those with the lowest are the Northern Territory (0.28%) and Tasmania (0.10%). Australian Sikh Games In 1988 the first annual Australian Sikh Games commenced, with Sikhs from South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales arriving in Adelaide to compete in a field hockey competition to celebrate the opening of the first Gurdwara in the city. From there the competition grew and in 1989 netball, Association football (soccer) and kabaddi. Tug o' war, volleyball and cricket are also included, while track and field and golf event have been previously competed but are currently non- competition events. Non-sports cultural events such as Bhangra and Giddha are also held simultaneously in the host city.http://www.australiansikhgames.com/origins.html Punjabi in Australia Punjabi is the 13th most common language in Australia with over 100,000 speakershttp://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/punjabi/censusexplorer/page/in/english and it is the 3rd most common language spoken at home among recent migrants. 81% of Punjabi speakers are Sikhs, 13.3% are Hindus and 1.4% are Muslims.http://indianherald.com.au/australian-news/census-reveals-rise-of- indians-in-australia/2050/ See also *Gurdwaras in Australia *Sikhism in Fiji *Indian Australian *Australian Sikh Heritage Trail References  External links  * Sikhs in Australia * Sikh Council of Australia Inc * Sikh Youth Australia Inc * Australian National Sikh Sports And Cultural Council Inc * Australian Sikh Games Australia ","title":"Sikhism in Australia"},{"id":"13038349","text":"Through the Years is a box set by Danish technical thrash metal band Artillery.

The band was composed of brothers Archie (lead singer, acoustic guitar, harmonica), Austin (acoustic guitar, harmonica), Bryan, a.k.a. \\"Dick\\" (tipple, a large, 10-stringed ukulele), Ross, a.k.a. \\"Blackie\\" (electric guitar) and Roy Talbot (bass), and their cousin Cromwell \\"Mandy\\" Mandres (accordion).  Early Life and background  Austin Gerald Talbot (1905-), Archibald Maxwell Talbot (1907‚Äì1972), Roy Almer Denmond Talbot (1915‚Äì2009), Hastings Ross Fanshaw Talbot (1918-2000), and Bryan Kingston Talbot (1920-) were the sons of Osmond Charles Fanshaw Talbot and Mamie Susan Kennedy Augusta Lambert, who had married in 1904, with an extended family centred in Tucker's Town (the only part of the Main Island that lies within St. George's Parish) and eastern Hamilton Parish, between Bailey's Bay and Paynter's Vale. Talbots had lived in this area since at least the 18th Century, and the brothers were related by descent to many other families of this area, including the Seon and Outerbridge families. They had five other siblings. Their mother's sister, Ainslie Letitia Dansmore Lambert, married Charles Adolphus Mansfield Manders in 1895, and gave birth to William Cromwell Manders in 1906. Oliver Constantine Lambert and Osmond Charles Fanshaw Talbot Most of the signatories of the 23 July, 1920, petition by residents of Tucker's Town against the planned land acquisitions and redevelopment called for in the \\"Bermuda Development Company Act (No. 2), 1920\\" were related to the Talbot Brothers, including their maternal grandfather, Oliver Constantine Lambert (born in Southampton Parish, the son of Samuel Deers Lambert and Ann Newbold), parents Osmond Charles Fanshaw Talbot and Ainslie Letitia Dansmore Manders, maternal uncles Stewart Hastings Lambert and Oliver Ceylon Lambert, maternal aunts Essie Celina Gertrude Lambert, Ann Mahew Constantine Simmons, and Ada Permelia Arlene Simmons, and other relatives Eliza Harriet Talbot (Smith), Rose Ann Smith, Dinna Smith, and five other Smiths, to whom they were related through both the Lambert (via their maternal grandmother, Rose Ann Lambert, born Rose Ann Smith) and Talbot families. Other signatories were Minnie Andrew Palmer, Henry Nelms, Clarkson Frederick Burgess, Henry Thomas Harvey, Oscar Anderson, and Lancelot Laud Havard, the Rector of Hamilton and Smith's Glebe. The petition was unsuccessful and Tucker's Town was compulsorily purchased with Dinna Smith the last resident to leave when she was forcibly removed from her property in 1923. Many of their relatives were participants in the civil suit of the descendants of Josiah Smith (the maternal grandfather of Mamie Susan Kennedy Augusta Lambert and Ainslie Letitia Dansmore Lambert) against the Bermuda Development Company in the Supreme Court in 1924 that resulted in compensation paid to the descendants for the land known as the Josiah Smith Estate at Tucker's Town.  Career  Before achieving a degree of fame with their best-known line-up, the Talbot Brothers had originally been composed in the 1930s of Austin Gerald Talbot, Archibald Maxwell Talbot, Roy Almer Denmond Talbot, and Ernest Stowell. The Talbots were the first of Bermuda‚Äôs many notable singing groups to gain international acclaim. With a population of fewer than 20,000 scattered over numerous islands totalling 21 square miles, Bermuda had no professional musicians or theatres until the advent of tourism during the latter 19th Century. The tourism industry was pioneered by wealthy visitors from North America, such as Samuel Clemens and Princess Louise, who would winter in Bermuda. New large hotels were built to cater to them, notably the Hamilton Hotel (completed in 1863), the Princess Hotel (completed in 1885), and the St. George's Hotel, and these created employment opportunities for professional musicians. Beyond the hotels, public entertainment relied primarily upon amateur theatrics and music hall-type performances, notably by soldiers assigned to the Bermuda Garrison. After the First World War, Bermuda's tourism industry went through considerable change as Prohibition led to a flood of affluent middle class visitors seeking sun and alcohol, and Bermuda became a summer rather than a winter destination. The large urban hotels were replaced by resorts sandwiched between private beaches and golf courses, such as the Castle Harbour Hotel, built near Paynter's Vale in the 1920s, and the Elbow Beach Hotel. The construction of the Castle Harbour Hotel (completed in 1931) and the related Mid-Ocean Club had resulted in the forced relocation of the inhabitants of Tucker's Town, with their homes replaced by golf links. The families that had lived there, including the Talbots, were mostly been resettled in Smith's Parish, near Devil's Hole and John Smith's Bay, where Talbot Lane is found today. Bermuda's new visitors demanded entertainments that the genteel community was ill-equipped to provide, including a new type of music. Musical tastes in Bermuda were little different from North America and Britain. West Indian musicians were consequently brought in by the hotels, and local musicians quickly adopted the Calypso they brought with them. The entertainments provided for tourists through the hotels remained separate and quite different, however, from the entertainments that catered to Bermudians, which still relied largely upon amateurs performing in church halls and similar venues. The Talbots organized in 1942 and performed a variation of Trinidadian calypso in a smooth melodic style influenced by popular music. They performed and recorded cover versions of calypso classics in addition to many of their own originals. They became a popular attraction in local hotels, but it was an early recording they made in the United States that made them even more popular in their homeland, and heralded fame beyond their shores. Bermuda Buggy Ride, according to the essay \\"Gombeys, Bands and Troubadours\\" on Bermuda‚Äôs official website... Their popularity with American tourists resulted in tours of the U.S. starting in the early 1950s. Notable in their instrumentation was Roy Talbot‚Äôs home-made upright bass dubbed the \\"doghouse.\\" Roy created the instrument out of a large meat-packing crate and a single fishing line. This item was a particular curiosity, and during the Talbots‚Äô tours many of their fellow performers and visiting celebrities would autograph the crate. The Talbots released 10\\" and 12\\" vinyl records on the small Audio Fidelity label in the mid-1950s before being signed to ABC Paramount Records in 1957, where they made two LPs that were more accessible in North America. They were frequent performers on television in the 1950s, appearing on Ed Sullivan's variety shows and other programs. Archie Talbot composed the title song to the 1956 Columbia motion picture Bermuda Affair. It is included on their first ABC Paramount LP. Ross, the penultimate survivor of the group, died in 2000 at the age of 82. An avid golfer, there is an annual charity golf tournament in Bermuda dedicated to him. Bassist Roy Talbot, who died on May 15, 2009, was the last surviving brother.Grimes, William. \\"Roy Talbot, Calypso Musician, Dies at 94\\", The New York Times, May 23, 2009. Accessed May 24, 2009.

It winds west and south through San Juan Canyon, and is joined by Arroyo Trabuco as it passes through San Juan Capistrano. It flows into the Pacific Ocean at Doheny State Beach. San Juan Canyon provides a major part of the route for California State Route 74 (the Ortega Highway). Before Spanish colonization in the 1770s, the San Juan Creek watershed was inhabited by the Acjachemen or Jua√±eno Native Americans. The Jua√±eno were named by Spanish missionaries who built Mission San Juan Capistrano on the banks of a stream they named San Juan Creek. The watershed was used mainly for agriculture and ranching until the 1950s when residential suburban development began on a large scale. Since then, the human population has continued to encroach on floodplains of local streams. Flooding in the 20th and 21st centuries has caused considerable property damage in the San Juan watershed. The San Juan watershed is home to sixteen major native plant communities and hundreds of animal species. However, the watershed is projected to be 48 percent urbanized by 2050. In addition, urban runoff has changed flow patterns in San Juan Creek and introduced pollutants to the river system. Although the main stem of San Juan Creek does not have any major water diversions or dams, some of its tributaries, including Trabuco and Oso Creeks, have been channelized or otherwise heavily modified by urbanization. Course The uppermost reaches of San Juan Creek are called San Juan Canyon and are followed by the narrow Ortega Highway. San Juan Creek begins high in the Santa Ana Mountains southwest of Lake Elsinore, at the head of the steep and narrow San Juan Canyon, at roughly in elevation where Morrell Canyon Creek, draining the western Elsinore Mountains and southernmost Santa Ana Mountains, has its confluence with Bear Canyon Creek. From there, it flows steeply down a rocky gorge over rapids and waterfalls. San Juan Canyon forms the mountain pass for California State Route 74 (the Ortega Highway), which connects San Juan Capistrano to Lake Elsinore and the Inland Empire. San Juan Falls, a cascade, and the Ortega Falls are located along the headwaters of the creek.Shaffer, p. 379-380 The creek then flows generally southwest through a canyon, receiving Hot Springs Creek and Cold Springs Creek from the right, and Lucas Canyon Creek from the left. At Caspers Wilderness Park, the San Juan Canyon opens up into a fairly wide valley in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. This reach of San Juan Creek is underlain by thick alluvial deposits and is still used for farming and grazing. It is joined by Bell Canyon from the right, and Verdugo Canyon Creek from the left. Trampas Canyon enters from the left and Ca√±ada Gobernadora and Ca√±ada Chiquita enter from the right. The creek flows through residential Rancho Mission Viejo, crosses under Interstate 5, and enters a concrete flood control channel, turning south and receiving El Horno Creek on the right. It receives its largest tributary, Arroyo Trabuco, from the right, then flows south toward the Pacific Ocean. The creek forms a fresh water lagoon at the northern end of Doheny State Beach, which overflows into Capistrano Bay during periods of high flow. Tributaries All direct tributaries of San Juan Creek, from mouth to source, are listed. The list also includes streams that join major tributaries. *Arroyo Trabuco ** Oso Creek *** La Paz Channel ** Tijeras Canyon Creek ** Live Oak Canyon Creek ** Hickey Canyon Creek ** Rose Canyon Creek ** Falls Canyon Creek ** Holy Jim Canyon Creek *El Horno Creek *Ca√±ada Chiquita *Ca√±ada Gobernadora ** Wagon Wheel Canyon Creek *Trampas Canyon *Verdugo Canyon *Bell Canyon (Bell Creek) ** Crow Canyon Creek ** Dove Canyon Creek ** Fox Canyon Creek *Lucas Canyon Creek (mouth of San Juan Canyon) ** Aliso Canyon Creek *Cold Springs Canyon *Hot Spring Canyon ** Chiquito Spring Creek *Lion Canyon Creek *Bear Canyon Creek (head of San Juan Canyon) *Morrell Canyon Creek **Long Canyon Creek *** Arroyo El Cariso **Decker Canyon Creek Bell Creek, the second largest tributary of San Juan Creek, flowing through Caspers Wilderness Park Geology The San Juan Creek watershed is crossed by a complex network of seismic fault zones, with streams tending to form canyons along fault traces. The Cristianitos fault (Cristianitos) runs northeast-southwest along Oso Creek, passing offshore south of the mouth of San Juan Creek. The Mission Viejo fault zone parallels the Cristianitos but ends much farther south, in San Diego County. The first recorded earthquake in the area partially destroyed Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1812 (which had been built only six years before), killing forty people in the adobe chapel when it collapsed. Other major quakes occurred in 1862, 1933 and 1938. Soils in the San Juan watershed are mostly sedimentary rock and are highly erosive, resulting in large alluvial deposits along floodplains. Soil types in the San Juan watershed can be divided into the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations. Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity. Over the past 1.2 million years the uplift of the San Joaquin Hills, a small coastal mountain range generally following the Pacific coast of Orange County, created a physical barrier for streams flowing off the Santa Ana Mountains. Climate change during the Ice Ages periodically made Southern California much wetter, most recently during the Wisconsinian Glaciation (70,000 to 10,000 years ago), when the area was home to a temperate rainforest climate that would receive rainfall in excess of per year. The increase in water flow in San Juan Creek allowed it to maintain its course as an antecedent stream, rather than being diverted to the east or west. Hydrology and groundwater San Juan Creek between San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point, after a rain The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured the discharge of San Juan Creek in the city of San Juan Capistrano for two periods, from 1928‚Äì1969 and from 1969‚Äì1985. Stream flows for the earlier period are considerably different from the later period due to increased volumes of urban runoff. For 1928‚Äì1969, the average discharge was , and the peak flow was on February 25, 1969. During the 1969‚Äì1985 period, the average flow was , and a peak flow of was recorded on March 4, 1978. After 1985, the USGS stopped measuring discharge but continues to monitor water level in real- time at the La Novia Street bridge. According to the city of San Juan Capistrano, the largest flood of record occurred on January 11, 2005 with an estimated discharge of . According to the California State Water Resources Control Board (1977) the San Juan Creek Groundwater Basin has a total volume of roughly . Natural groundwater recharge in the San Juan basin is estimated at per year. This amount has been reduced due to extensive urbanization of the lower watershed which results in more water running off to the Pacific Ocean. However, water from irrigation run-off and other human activities is responsible for recharging an additional per year. The Christianitos and Mission Viejo fault zones split the watershed into distinct \\"Upper\\" and \\"Lower\\" groundwater basins. The groundwater mostly lies in alluvium, which ranges from a depth of in the lower elevations to almost none in the high elevations. Groundwater in this basin at the San Juan Capistrano reach is considered of high quality.Earth Metrics Incorporated, Phase I Environmental Site Assessment for Rancho San Juan Capistrano, bounded by San Juan Creek Road, Paseo Ranchero and Camino San Jose Road, San Juan Capistrano, California, January 4, 1990 Although San Juan Creek contains water for most of the year, it is highly seasonal, with strong flows during the wettest months of January through March, and shrinking to a trickle during the other months. In poor rain years, the stream can often dry up completely in its lower reaches. The total natural (unimpaired) surface outflow from the San Juan basin into the Pacific is estimated at per year. Agricultural and urban runoff significantly increased the average outflow, to as of 1993. The maximum annual outflow is . Although the use of local surface water and groundwater is increasing, local groundwater levels have not been affected significantly by human use, due to the relatively high natural recharge rate. Due to the lower amount of urbanization in the San Juan watershed as compared with other watersheds in the county, the 100-year flood inundation risk is also significantly lower than in other parts of Orange County. It has been calculated that a 100-year flood in the watershed would only affect a roughly wide area for the lower reaches of San Juan Creek inside San Juan Capistrano, while for Arroyo Trabuco, only a wide area would be affected, mainly due to considerable entrenchment of the river bed.Technical Background Report, General Plan Update ‚Äì City of San Juan Capistrano, August 1999 However, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers considers many levees in the San Juan Capistrano area to be inadequate for handling the 100-year flood, and that such a flood would cause $149 million of property damage. Watershed Lake Mission Viejo is an artificial lake formed by a dam across Oso Creek, used primarily for recreation. The San Juan Creek watershed covers in south Orange County and a very small portion of Riverside County. The Santa Ana Mountains occupy most of the north, east and south parts watershed, while the San Joaquin Hills border the watershed on the southwest. Along with San Juan Creek, the two largest tributaries ‚Äì Trabuco and Bell Creeks ‚Äì both originate in the Santa Ana Mountains. Although more than half of the watershed is undeveloped land, it also includes parts of the cities of Dana Point, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and the unincorporated communities of Trabuco Canyon (near Rancho Santa Margarita) and Rancho Mission Viejo (east of San Juan). There are four main alluvial river valleys in the watershed. The San Juan Creek valley occupies the south portion of the watershed; the heavily urbanized lower (southwest) portion is located in the cities of San Juan Capistrano and Dana Point, while the largely rural (northeast) portion extends well into the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. The Arroyo Trabuco valley forms a large alluvial plain called \\"Plano Trabuco\\" in the north part of the watershed (part of suburban Rancho Santa Margarita). The Oso Creek valley is narrower, running south through Mission Viejo and Laguna Hills, and is mostly urbanized. The Bell Creek valley is the least urbanized of the four, being mostly located in the Cleveland National Forest, Starr Ranch Preserve and Caspers Wilderness Park. There are 19 other major tributaries in the watershed. The California Department of Water Resources includes San Juan Creek in the San Juan Hydrologic Unit, which includes the coastal watersheds of Aliso Creek, Salt Creek, Prima Deshecha Ca√±ada, Segunda Deshecha Ca√±ada, and San Mateo Creek, which share a similar range of elevations and climate. Elevation in the Hydrologic Unit ranges from sea level to at Santiago Peak (the headwater of Holy Jim Creek, a tributary of Arroyo Trabuco). The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Almost all the precipitation occurs between October and April; the average rainfall is , although mountain areas often receive higher amounts. San Juan Creek receives extra runoff from agriculture, urban areas, and other human sources, resulting in unnatural dry season flows that carry trash, heavy metals, oils, pesticides and fertilizer into the creek. The heaviest source of pollution is Oso Creek. Michael Hazzard, a Southern California environmentalist, said after diving into Upper Oso Creek Reservoir: \\"I spent three days diving to retrieve an outboard motor and my skin broke out in hives and boils and my gallbladder suffered and I later had six operations over a 2-year period.\\"'' Ecology Upland riparian and stream habitat along Hot Spring Canyon San Juan Creek was originally rich in riparian zones and other types habitat in both its upper and lower watershed, with wetlands totaling over historically in the lower reaches, before urban development began in the 1950s. Only 0.3 percent of those wetlands remain. Recent efforts of stream conservation have been in the planning stage including habitat conservation plan work.U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jae Chung, San Juan Creek/San Mateo Creek SAMP, 27 December 2007 There are sixteen prominent vegetation zones in the San Juan watershed, which include riparian vegetation, montane woodlands, coastal sage scrub and chaparral. Riparian vegetation is found along the banks of free-flowing streams with a measurable flow for at least several months out of the year. These include most of San Juan Creek, upper Arroyo Trabuco, Ca√±ada Gobernadora, Bell Canyon, and other headwater streams, as well as scattered patches along Oso and El Horno creeks. Forests are present at high elevations, and also occur in close proximity to waterways. Coastal sage scrub is found on south-facing hillsides, while chaparral is found on higher-elevation hillsides and mesas. There are also a number of rare plant communities along rock outcroppings and vernal pools. However, introduced plant species, such as giant reed, castor bean, and tobacco tree, are rapidly spreading along streams. Giant reed has taken over huge areas of wetlands, swamps and riparian zones along the creek and its tributaries, although in recent years the county has taken steps toward eradicating it from San Juan Creek and other nearby streams. Historically, the San Juan watershed supported up to 12 invertebrate species, 5 fish species, 12 amphibian species, 35 reptile species, 143 bird species, and 42 mammal species, which benefited from the diverse vegetation communities present. Some streams and ponds host federally listed endangered/threatened species such as tidewater goby, fairy shrimp, and California red-legged frog. Federally listed bird species include least Bell's vireo, California gnatcatcher, California least tern, and southwestern willow flycatcher. Other listed species include Pacific pocket mouse and Quino checkerspot butterfly. As urbanization continues to increase in the San Juan watershed, most sensitive species have been pushed back to the foothills, mountains, and agricultural/ranching areas of the watershed. In 1987, just five bird species were confirmed in the watershed, while for fish, benthic invertebrates, and certain insects there were no confirmed observations, in part due to insufficient site coverage. Steelhead trout have recently begun to return to San Juan Creek, only to find many man-made obstructions preventing them from spawning. Historic accounts suggest that San Juan Creek provided habitat for steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) in many historic accounts. However, pollution and competition from introduced sport fishes such as bluegill and striped bass have extirpated steelhead in the creek. Bacteria levels in San Juan Creek exceed state standards by 93 percent. The loss of riparian habitat along the lower of San Juan Creek and much of Trabuco and Oso Creeks due to channelization has also reduced steelhead habitat. However, in 2003 the California Department of Fish and Game reported three sightings of steelhead in a large stream pool along Trabuco Creek, immediately downstream of a drop structure that channels the creek beneath Interstate 5. In response, the Department of Fish and Game lobbied Caltrans to build a fish ladder at the structure, but it has not yet been implemented, due to concerns about structural stability of the I-5 bridge and the presence of a nearby natural gas pipeline. History Indigenous peoples Pre-contact tribal boundaries in Southern California Before the 18th century, the San Juan Creek watershed was mostly Acjachemem Native American territory, which extended from Aliso Creek in the north to San Mateo Creek in the south, a distance of roughly . Most of the population lived along the two major streams in the area, San Juan and San Mateo Creeks, as well as Arroyo Trabuco. The Acjachemem, who numbered roughly 2000 overall, were hunter-gatherers, living in small, semi-permanent villages close to water sources. There were five villages on the main stem of San Juan Creek, three of which were below the Arroyo Trabuco confluence, and four more in other parts of the watershed, mostly on Trabuco and Oso Creeks. The Acjachemem diet usually consisted of fruits, acorns, grains, and some meat, while they practiced little agriculture. Shell middens indicate that they also harvested shellfish from the coast. Native peoples in this area are not known to have built permanent structures in this area or significantly influenced the natural environment. Spanish arrival The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol√° expedition, passed this way on its way north, camping at San Juan Creek on July 23, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary: \\"...we came to a very pleasant green valley, full of willows, alders, live oaks, and other trees not known to us. It has a large arroyo, which at the point where we crossed it carried a good stream of fresh and good water, which, after running a little way, formed in pools in some large patches of tules.\\" On the return journey to San Diego, the party used the campsite again, on January 20. In 1776, Father Jun√≠pero Serra founded Mission San Juan Capistrano on a site close to the creek (possibly near the Ca√±ada Gobernadora confluence), and the creek was named after the mission. The first site was abandoned due to lack of water, although some historical accounts suggest the creek once had a perennial flow. The mission was moved to a second site in present-day San Juan Capistrano, where it still stands. The Spanish referred to the Acjachemem as the Jua√±eno. The Spanish made the first recorded anthropogenic changes to hydrology in the San Juan watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams. Grazing animals introduced by Europeans, mainly cattle (and later sheep, after a drought decimated the local cattle ranching industry), consumed native grasses and left hillsides exposed and prone to erosion. Mission San Juan Capistrano The origin of the name of Arroyo Trabuco (Spanish: \\"Blunderbuss Creek\\", literally) stems from the Gaspar de Portol√† expedition of 1769, during which a soldier lost a blunderbuss (\\"trabuco\\"), and the name became associated with the creek after that point. The origin of the name of Oso Creek (Spanish: \\"Bear Creek\\") is not known. Many of the creeks in the watershed have names of Spanish origin, which were most likely named by the Spanish conquistadors a long time before the area was annexed by the United States. Before urban development, the damage caused by overgrazing during the Spanish period was still considered capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3 percent in 1964 to 18 percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent. 20th century to present In the late 1960s, Dana Point Harbor was constructed adjacent to the mouth of San Juan Creek. The breakwater prevented the occurrence of a large surf break phenomenon, colloquially known as \\"Killer Dana\\", in the bay. When Killer Dana disappeared, water circulation in the bay decreased. As polluted runoff from San Juan Creek continues to flow into the bay, it is trapped for extended periods of time. At Doheny State Beach, 850,000 annual visitors are exposed to potential health risks from high bacteria levels in the water. San Juan Creek at the old Ganado bridge, c. 1958 During floods in the 1990s, an almost sheer waterfall appeared on Arroyo Trabuco in northern San Juan Capistrano, threatening the foundations of a railroad bridge. The drop required quick reinforcement with grouted riprap. With an average gradient of 29 percent it has become a major barrier to migrating fish and other riverine organisms, and thus isolates aquatic environments in upper Arroyo Trabuco from the rest of the San Juan watershed. In 1996, severe floods caused by heavy rainstorms in the San Juan watershed caused San Juan Creek to overflow, destroying long sections of the concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap. In early 2005, even more severe flooding impacted the San Juan watershed, with an all-time highest flow of recorded on January 11. Although the floods did not exceed the San Juan Creek channel capacity of , the west levee of the channel inside San Juan Capistrano nearly failed. Also in 2005, pumps were installed on Tick and Dove Creeks (tributaries of Bell Canyon) to remove urban runoff from of residential areas in eastern Rancho Santa Margarita. The pumps remove excess flow and divert it to storage basins for later use as reclaimed irrigation water. Between 2009 and 2013, extensive levee repairs were conducted along lower San Juan Creek. Construction closed the popular San Juan Creek bikeway for two years, inciting protests from many area residents who are frequent users of the path. River modifications Drop structure viewed during rainfall, near the San Juan-Trabuco confluence Concrete banks of San Juan Creek in Dana Point, c. 1963 Although the San Juan Creek watershed is less heavily developed than other coastal Orange County watersheds, extensive works have been constructed to control floods, reduce erosion, and provide reclaimed water for irrigation. A growing amount of urban runoff flows into the creek and its tributaries, creating a dry season \\"nuisance flow\\". Historically, only San Juan Creek and Arroyo Trabuco were known to contain water for most or all of the year. Oso Creek was formerly a seasonal stream, but it now has a permanent flow due to urban runoff. Runoff has caused Doheny Beach to rank in the ten most polluted beaches of California. The Upper Oso Reservoir and Lake Mission Viejo, both on Oso Creek, are the largest impoundments in the watershed, holding about combined. While Lake Mission Viejo was built solely for recreation, the Upper Oso Reservoir collects Oso Creek water and diverts it for irrigation use. The reservoir is occasionally used by air tankers to combat wildfires in the Cleveland National Forest. The Santa Margarita Water District is currently proposing a new reservoir in Verdugo Canyon, another tributary of San Juan Creek, to collect and store reclaimed water. The lower of San Juan Creek are channelized between levees, from a point immediately upstream of the Interstate 5 bridge to Doheny Beach. Arroyo Trabuco is only channelized for several hundred yards above its confluence with San Juan Creek. Oso Creek is the most heavily modified, flowing in an artificial channel for almost its entire length. Bell Creek and other eastern tributaries have retained their natural characteristics. The USACE describes the San Juan and Arroyo Trabuco levees as providing a \\"fairly high level of protection currently\\", though flooding in 1996 and 2005 caused significant damage. As a result, failure scenarios of levees in the San Juan watershed have been extensively studied. To protect against future flooding, work has begun on a new west-bank levee replacement to be finished in 2013. A few check dams exist on small upper tributaries of San Juan Creek, mostly inside the Cleveland National Forest. A larger gabion-type dam is located on the middle part of San Juan Creek near the Ca√±ada Gobernadora. Although the dam has silted in and is no longer used for water storage, its roughly drop still poses a problem for migrating steelhead. There are a few water diversion weirs that exist on San Juan tributary streams to divert water for irrigation, ranching and limited municipal uses, but due to limited flows and polluted water, the usefulness of these structures are limited. A number of drop structures (small dams used to control water velocity and erosion) exist on tributaries of San Juan Creek. On Arroyo Trabuco, there are eight drop structures, mostly built of riprap. The largest are a cascade immediately downstream of a Metrolink bridge, and a concrete drop structure at the terminus of a culvert that crosses underneath Interstate 5. There are also seven drop structures on Oso Creek, mostly built of riprap. There are no such specifically constructed structures on San Juan Creek itself.

The film is a spoof of B-movie sci-fi films from the 1950s. It had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 1989. Plot Young filmmaker Stevie Horowitz eagerly awaits a meeting with big shot Hollywood film producer J.P. Shelldrake. Shelldrake has been desperately searching for a way to avoid problems with the IRS and unpaid millions owed them in back taxes. His brilliant yet overpaid accountant devises a scheme to allow the producer to write off the expenses of his next movie release, but only if the film is a box office flop. Armed with his foolproof plan, Shelldrake agrees to meet with Stevie and screen his film \\"Lobster Man From Mars\\" (financed by Stevie's jailed con man Uncle Joey). The plot resembles the premise of The Producers by Mel Brooks. Inside Shelldrake's private screening room, the \\"film within the film\\" begins. They watch the weird plot unfold: Mars suffers from a severe air leakage. The King of Mars commands the dreaded Lobster Man and his assistant Mombo, a gorilla wearing a space helmet, to pilot his flying saucer to Earth then steal its air. Once landed, the Lobster Man wastes no time transforming hapless victims into smoking skeletons. On a lonely road, John and Mary, a young and innocent couple discovers the hiding place of the flying saucer in a dark and mysterious cave. They attempt to warn the authorities but are ignored. Successfully contacting Professor Plocostomos, a plan is created to lure the Lobster Man to Mr. Throckmorton's Haunted House that just happens to be surrounded by boiling hot springs. Once lured, it is simply a matter of pushing the Lobster Man into the hot water where he will be boiled to death. The plan is interrupted by Colonel Ankrum and his troops. The house is shelled and destroyed, the Lobster Man flees to his cave, taking Mary with him. She manages to escape, but the Lobster Man follows. A wild chase ensues, but Professor Plocostomos uses the hot engine coolant from his overheated vehicle to drench Mombo causing his foamy demise. The chase concludes in Yellowstone Park where the dreaded Lobster Man is tricked into walking into the Old Faithful Geyser and a steamy end. The screening is over. Shelldrake cannot believe his good fortune to witness such a bad movie with potential to lose every cent invested in its distribution and promotion. He buys the production on the spot, but once in release it becomes a big hit and makes a huge profit sending Shelldrake straight to tax prison, with Stevie taking his place as the studio's new boy wonder.

The Martin Olav Sabo Bridge is a bridge in the city of Minneapolis and the first cable- stayed suspension bridge in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Formerly the Midtown Greenway Pedestrian Bridge, it was renamed in honor of former Representative Martin Olav Sabo, a fourteen-term member of Congress from Minnesota. Opened and dedicated in November 2007, the bridge crosses Hiawatha Avenue (Trunk Highway 55) north of 28th Street East and just south of 26th Street East, joining Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Minneapolis Midtown Greenway at Hiawatha Avenue, allowing a continuous biking connection across the city. The bridge also links Longfellow community (Longfellow and Seward neighborhoods) to Phillips community (East Phillips neighborhood), and connects users to the north-south Hiawatha LRT Trail and Little Earth Trail. The bridge was built by Hennepin County and transferred to the City of Minneapolis, which owns and maintains the bridge. The bridge was closed on February 20, 2012 when two of the cables that support the bridge fell due to cracks in their attachment points; additional significant cracks were subsequently found in two other support plates. The bridge, supported with temporary bracing, was reopened June 1, 2012. A summary report of the failure analysis released June 8, 2012 determined that unaccounted for wind-induced cable vibrations led to the failures of the attachment points. The bridge was again closed for repairs on September 23, 2012. Repairs were completed, and the bridge reopened, on November 19, 2012. Configuration The new bridge eliminates the need for bicyclists and pedestrians to cross busy Hiawatha Avenue with a stoplight at grade-level. Instead, the bridge brings them north one block, over the highway, and back south, introducing a new grade-level crossing of 28th Street East west of Hiawatha. Users are still able to use the at-grade Hiawatha crossing after completion. Structure The bridge has a total length of 2,200 feet. Its main span passes 220 feet over Hiawatha Avenue, with the cable-stay tower rising 100 feet above the bridge-deck level. The Martin Olav Sabo Bridge is the first true cable-stayed suspension bridge in the State of Minnesota. Its design was the product of engineering consulting firm URS, with community input. History During Congressman Martin Olav Sabo's tenure, he earmarked $2.9 million in federal funding to the project. He is also recognized for acquiring federal funding to complete many capital improvements throughout Minneapolis. City advisory boards and committees forwarded the recommendation to rename the bridge after Sabo in 2005, which was done by the City Council. Hennepin County provided additional funding to total $5.1 million for the final project. This contains official documentation from the Minneapolis Department of Public Works. 2012 structural failures Late on the night of February 19, 2012, the two longest support cables on the bridge were found detached and lying across the bridge deck below. The bridge was closed shortly thereafter to all traffic. The portion of Hiawatha Avenue that passes underneath the bridge was also closed, and light rail service was suspended on the tracks that pass beneath the bridge. The light rail resumed service on February 24, 2012, after emergency supports were placed underneath the bridge and a second pair of cables were removed due to cracks in their anchor points. Hiawatha Avenue was reopened to traffic underneath the bridge on February 27, 2012. The original cable failure was due to cracks in diaphragm plates that anchor the ends of the cables to the steel tower, and significant cracks have subsequently been found in three of those anchorages. The engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. was hired to investigate how the diaphragm plates became compromised. On June 8, 2012, a summary report of the investigation was released in which the failure was attributed to wind-induced \\"cable vibrations that induce damaging stress range cycles at fatigue sensitive details in the cable diaphragm plates.\\" The effect of cable vibrations caused by wind was not included in the original design package for the bridge. The bridge reopened for bicycle and pedestrian traffic on June 1, 2012, with temporary support structures in place. New plates were designed, and the bridge was closed once more between September 23, 2012, and November 19, 2012, to allow them to be retrofitted as permanent repairs.

It was chartered in 1870, authorized by Congress in 1875 and built later that year. The line ran from the Arsenal (now Fort McNair) to Union Town (now Historic Anacostia). It expanded, adding lines to Congressional Cemetery, Central Market and to the Government Hospital for the Insane; and in the late 1890s it purchased two other companies and expanded their lines. It was reluctant to change its operations, but in 1900 it relented to pressure and became the last company to switch from horse cars to electric streetcars. It was one of the few companies not to be swept up by the two major streetcar companies at the turn of the 20th century, but it could not hold out forever and on August 31, 1912, it was purchased by the Washington Railway and Electric Company and ceased to operate as a unique entity. Origins Map of the Washington, D.C. Streetcar System at the end of the Horse Car era in 1888 The Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad was chartered on May 5, 1870, given approval by Congress on February 18, 1875, and constructed across the Anacostia River later that year. The streetcars traveled from the Arsenal, along M Street SW/SE and 11th Street SE, and crossed the Navy Yard Bridge to Uniontown (now Historic Anacostia). The route then led down Nichols Avenue SE (now Martin Luther King Avenue) to V Street SE where a car barn and stables were maintained by the company. Expansion On August 1, 1888, the railroad was permitted to expand from the Navy Yard to Congressional Cemetery along 11th Street SE and G Street SE, and past Garfield Park to the Center Market (now the National Archives) in downtown. It completed the expansion later that year. At the same time it was permitted to expand along Nichols Avenue past the Government Hospital for the Insane (now St. Elizabeths Hospital) to the District boundary, though it only made it as far as Alabama Avenue SE. The next year, on June 24, 1898, the Anacostia and Potomac River continued its expansion by purchasing the Belt Railway and extended its 11 Street line from F street NW to Florida Avenue NW. In 1899 it purchased the Capital Railway. The company came into a dispute with the Washington, Alexandria and Mount Vernon Railway over their shared use of track on Fourteenth Street. Following litigation that settled in April 1900, the two companies became joint owners of the track in the dispute with the Anacostia and Potomac to pay $18,000 for its share and to provide a 550V power supply for the WA&MV; streetcars to operate there. Switch to electric power The company finally switched from horses to electric in April 1900. It was the last horse-drawn streetcar to run in the District. The end of the line One of several extant manhole covers from the Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad Company On June 5, 1899, the Anacostia and Potomac, along with eleven other companies in the area, became subsidiaries of the Washington Traction and Electric Company, which was incorporated on that date as a holding company to unify streetcar operations in the area. The holding company later merged with the Capital Traction Company in 1933. The Anacostia and Potomac River, though initially involved, avoided being wholly purchased during this period. Nonetheless, on August 31, 1912, the Washington Railway purchased the controlling stock of the Anacostia and Potomac River and it ceased to run as a separate company. In 1938, two lawsuits were brought against the Washington Railway by the bondholders of the Anacostia & Potomac to pay nearly $4,000,000 in bonds from the former company.

It is the neurotoxin responsible for the motor neuron degeneration syndrome lathyrism. Sources ODAP is found in the seeds of the legume L. sativus, a grass pea plant, at a constant concentration of .5%. L. sativus can be found in areas of Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, Iraq and Afghanistan as well as areas of Asia and Africa.Heuz√© V., Tran G., Hassoun P., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2016. Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/285 Last updated on April 19, 2016, 15:36 History In some regions, including the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Nepal, the grass pea has become a staple food item. The plant has a high tolerance of environmental conditions which results in it being the only available food source in times of famine or drought. Following these several month droughts, neurolathyrism epidemics may occur. The last instance of such an epidemic (as of 2013) was in Ethiopia during the 1995-1997 drought during which 2000 people were crippled. Biological effects ODAP is an agonist of the ionotropic AMPA glutamate receptor. It is known to cause neurolathyrism in humans, a motor neuron degenerative disease characterized by degeneration of pyramidal-tract neurons in the spinal cord and in the area of the cortex controlling the legs, resulting in lower-body paralysis. There is not one direct explanation as to how ODAP causes neurolathyrism; however, there has been evidence to support a few biological effects. One reason why the mechanism of action is not entirely clear may be because, so far, a good animal model for the effect of ODAP in humans has not been found. The LD50 is also unknown. Excitotoxicity ODAP activates AMPA receptors which can induce excitotoxicity, or an overstimulation of glutamate receptors. The release of too much glutamate, either at once or over a prolonged period of time, will lead to increased levels of in the cytoplasm. Since is the signaling molecule for the release of glutamate into the synapse, this can result in potentiation of the glutamate release cycle and the spread of excitotoxic damage to neighboring neurons. Inside the neuron, the extra will leave the cytoplasm and enter either the mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which can lead to accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER and ultimately cell death in both cases. In addition to acting as an agonist there is evidence to show that ODAP is transported into the cell by an antiporter that simultaneously transports glutamate into the synapse. Oxidative stress The second biological effect of ODAP is oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the mitochondria during metabolism, and the body has mechanisms in place to neutralize these molecules before they cause damage. Oxidative stress results from a disturbance in the normal functioning of these pathways. One antioxidant in the neutralizing pathway is glutathione (GSH), whose synthesis requires the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine as precursors. It is thought that ODAP, possibly due to the induced excitotoxicity, reduces the intake of cysteine through its antiporter. This inhibits the synthesis of GSH, leading to an increased production of ROS and mitochondrial damage. Motor neurons may be the most sensitive to ODAP poisoning because they exhibit a greater dependency on the GSH precursor methionine. In addition, the L. sativus plant is deficient in sulfur- containing amino acids, enhancing the receptor-level effects of ODAP on the production of GSH when ingested. Synthesis Biosynthesis In L. sativus ODAP is synthesized in the young seedlings from the precursor (Œ≤-isoxazolin-5-on-2-yl)-alanine, also known as BIA. BIA has not been detected in mature plant parts or ripening seeds. The pathway begins with the formation of BIA from O-acetyl-L-serine (OAS) and isoxazolin-5-on. A ring opening leads to the formation of the short-lived intermediate 2,3-L-diaminopropanoic acid (DAPRO) which is then oxalylized by oxalyl-coenzyme A to form ODAP. The biosynthesis pathway of ODAP in L. sativus. Chemical synthesis ODAP can be synthesized from L-Œ±,Œ≤-diaminopropionic acid and dimethyl oxalate at a pH of 4.5-5. Cupric oxide can be used to temporarily protect the Œ±-NH2 group of the L-Œ±,Œ≤-diaminoproprionic acid during the reaction.

In November 1994, Wong gave her first live performance in over five years in Toronto, Canada, before completing a tour of Asia as well as other shows in Canada and the United States. Wong was now writing more of her own material. In fact in her final album for Cinepoly, Exasperation (1996), she was responsible for all the songs. Winning huge critical praise, the album contained three tracks that had no lyrics but, instead, just utilized Wong's voice.

It contains mainly her own compositions, with an aesthetic inspired by the Cocteau Twins, who contributed two original songs to the album, \\"Fracture\\" (ÂàÜË£Ç) and \\"Spoilsport\\" (ÊéÉËàà). Wong had previously covered their work on Random Thoughts in 1994, and established a remote working relationship with them ‚Äì even laying down vocals for a special duet version of \\"Serpentskirt\\" on the Asian release of the group's 1996 album Milk And Kisses, as her voice blended well with Elizabeth Fraser's ethereal soprano. A Buddhist, Wong weaves teachings of transience and disengagement into the album. These themes can also be found in some of her other albums. Reception Paying less attention to the demands of the mainstream market, the album's sales were lower than for Wong's preceding albums. However, Restless was received favorably by critics, and is considered her boldest and most artistically coherent effort to date.Full review at douban.com, 2010-01-15 After the release, Wong became the second Chinese artist (after Gong Li) and the first Chinese singer to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, under the headline \\"The Divas Of Pop\\".

This lever allowed for the development of larger, more powerful organs still responsive to the human hand. These larger organs first flourished in France, e.g., the organ produced by Cavaill√©-Coll at St. Sulpice. The first Barker lever was built in the Cavaill√©-Coll organ of the Basilica of Saint-Denis.

It was inaugurated on 4 September 1904, in time for the holidays of and around Rosh haShana. The synagogue stands off the street alignment and is reached by a thoroughfare in the pertaining front building. The years 1902 to 1933 (), comprising the bulk of Jewish faithful of mainstream (also called liberal, in today's English terminology 'conservative'), Orthodox and Reform affiliation, grew strongly in membership in the second half of the 19th century. With the expansion of Berlin into new neighbourhoods the need of additional synagogues within a walking distance became urgent. However, the Jewish community could not fulfill all the claims for additional premises, so many private synagogues (Vereinssynagogen, literally synagogues of registered associations) emerged scattered over the city. Most Jews in Prenzlauer Berg, however, could not afford to establish a Vereinssynagoge with their own funds. So in 1902 J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin bought the site in and its building master Johann Hoeniger (1850‚Äì1913) was commissioned to design and supervise the building of this new synagogue. Construction started in 1903 and at noon on Sunday, 4 September 1904, the synagogue was inaugurated with Handel's prelude in D major and the Ma Tovu prayer led by cantor David Stabinski (1857‚Äì1919), Rabbi (1848‚Äì1916, illuminating the ner tamid) and Rabbi Adolf Rosenzweig (1850‚Äì1918) preaching.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 10seqq. Almost the complete board (Vorstand) of J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin and many members of the elected assembly of representatives (Repr√§sentantenversammlung) attended the ceremony, while the city of Berlin sent its school councillor Carl Michaelis and , president of the city parliament. In the afternoon of the same day Berlin's other Jewish community , solely comprising Orthodox members, opened its own synagogue in Artilleriestra√üe, today's Tucholskystra√üe. Five days later on the eve of Rosh haShana the Rykestra√üe Synagogue was first time used for its actual religious purpose. The nave during a guided tour on the occasion of the European Heritage Days in 2007 With its members of different Jewish affiliations J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin also offered services in its different synagogues following different ceremonial styles. Some followed old style (Alter Ritus), such as the on Heidereutergasse 4, especially for the members clinging to the so-called intra-community orthodoxy (Gemeindeorthodoxie, as opposed to seceded orthodoxy [Austrittsorthodoxie], the proponents of which had seceded from J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin establishing Adass Jisroel in 1869). Other synagogues applied the new style (Neuer Ritus), often including organ music, (mixed) choirs and additional songs sung in German language.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 23seq. Each synagogue of J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin had its own elected Synagogenvorstand (board of gabba'im), which developed synagogal minhagim including their own peculiarities.Cf. Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 21seq. Rykestra√üe Synagogue adopted a compromise minhag close to Alter Ritus. Thus rabbis of mainstream and Orthodox affiliation served the congregants. The gabba'im decided to allow women and men sitting side by side, despite criticism from some Orthodox members.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 11. In this the synagogue equalled the practice in L√ºtzowstra√üe Synagogue. The plan to install an organ ‚Äì as realised in Berlin's New Synagogue in 1861 ‚Äì was given up after a hefty debate.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 15seq. The space in the prayer hall prepared for the organ remained empty. In 1904 J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin opened a Jewish religious school (VI. Religionsschule) in the front building.Cf. Israelitisches Familienblatt, 3 October 1904. During World War I J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin engaged Rabbi Martin Joseph as chaplain for Jewish Russian prisoners of war kept in detention centres at Berlin. On the high holidays the German High Command allowed them to attend services in Rykestra√üe Synagogue.Cf. Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 23. Joseph Himmel (1872‚Äì1943, Theresienstadt) served as president of the gabba'im in the 1910s probably until the 1920s. Orthodox Rabbi Siegfried Alexander (1886‚Äì1943, Auschwitz) won the congregants to elect the first woman, Martha Ehrlich (n√©e Eisenhardt; 1896‚Äì1942) as gabba'i, equally participating in gabba'i decisions and tasks, however, except of ‚Äì unlike her male colleagues ‚Äì calling congregants up to read the Torah.Cf. Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 25seq. In the 1930s until the closure of the synagogue in 1940, Josef Luster (1886‚Äì1943, Auschwitz) presided the board of gabba'im.He ran a kosher mineral- water and soft-drink factory on a site adjacent to the synagogue in the same block. In 1922 a private School Association opened a Jewish school in the front building. The synagogue served the congregants in the Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood as place of worship and for their rites of passage such as weddings and Bar Mitzvah ceremonies as well as Bat Mitzvah ceremonies starting as of the mid-1920s.Cf. Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 18. On Yom Kippur ceremonies the prayer of Kol Nidrei was skipped, as was typical for Neuer Ritus style. However, this was protested in the 1920s by a group of congregants, the so-called Kol Nidrei demonstrators, who ostentatiously left the main prayer hall shortly before the service on the eve of Yom Kippur and then formed a minyan in the hallway, praying Kol Nidrei there, before returning again to the main hall.Cf. Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 24. The Israelitisches Familienblatt dedicated an article to the 25th anniversary of the inauguration of the Synagogue,Cf. Israelitisches Familienblatt, 15 August 1929. while the gabba'im decided to celebrate a special ceremony on Sunday, 29 September 1929. Some congregants formed a registered association for the Rykestra√üe Synagogue (Synagogenverein Rykestra√üe), promoting strong company among the congregants, organising meetings, festivities, lectures to this end, cherishing Jewish traditions and collecting and donating money for needy congregants (Tzedakah), but also demanding a say at employing rabbis and cantors. In 1931 Hugo Alexander presided over the association. In January 1933 Sally Heilbrunn, (1869‚Äì1951, Tel Aviv) and Rabbi Moritz Freier gathered 300 people protesting the replacement of Michael Sachs' R√∂delheim siddur (Siddur Sefat Emet ◊°◊ì◊ï◊® ◊°◊§◊™ ◊ê◊û◊™) and machzor by the Berlin unitary siddur and machzor (Einheitsgebetsbuch).Cf. Israelitisches Familienblatt, 18 January 1933. On 25 January the same year Synagogenverein gathered for a lecture and made the case for unitary siddur and machzor, denying aiming at Reform but at restoring the minhag as it used to be until by 1928, claiming that most congregants disliked the traditionalist changes since.Cf. Israelitisches Familienblatt, 2 February 1933. In the end the protesters prevailed and the R√∂delheim siddur and machzor remained in use in Rykestra√üe Synagogue until today. The synagogue during Nazi rule The upcoming Nazi dictatorship with its anti-Semitic discriminations, invidiousnesses, persecutions, and atrocities changed the lives of German Jewry so thoroughly that disputes on style and traditions fell silent. After the new Nazi government had widely banned Jewish performers, artists and scientists from public stages and lecterns, Rykestra√üe Synagogue opened for their concerts and lectures organised by Kulturbund Deutscher Juden or benefit performances by J√ºdisches Winterhilfswerk (Jewish winter aid endowment) in favour of poor Jews, who had been excluded from government benefits.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 38. On 16 February 1934 the synagogal choir under Kurt Burchard (1877‚Äì1942, Auschwitz) enacted for the first time the new Friday night liturgy that had been composed by Jakob Dymont (1881‚Äì1956), choirmaster at Adass Jisroel synagogue. Dymont composed it along the melodies of chazzanut following the Nussach. Also Dymont's Shabbat morning liturgy was presented in the synagogue. For the 30th anniversary of the synagogue, Rudolf Melnitz reported in Israelitisches Familienblatt that the synagogue had attracted more people and that, with Orthodox and mainstream rabbis officiating, Rykestra√üe congregation enjoyed a unique richeness.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 34seq. The synagogue did not burn during the November Pogrom, then euphemised as \\"Kristallnacht\\" (Night of Broken Glass) on 9 November 1938, when Nazis attacked in well organised pogroms synagogues and Jewish businesses.Zeugnisse j√ºdischer Kultur: Erinnerungsst√§tten in Mecklenburg- Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin, Sachsen-Anhalt, Sachsen und Th√ºringen , Klaus Arlt, Ingrid Ehlers, Constantin Beyer (photos) et al., Berlin: Tourist-Verlag and Wichern-Verlag, 1992, p. 145. Instead the Nazis ordered ‚Äì as in other comparable sites tooThe synagogue in Berlin's Pestalozzistra√üe was not set on fire at the November Pogrom due to its location inside a block, the synagogue in Augsburg weathered it, because it neighboured a compound of kerosine tanks, the synagogue in L√ºbeck, because it stood (and still stands) almost wall to wall to the city's Museum of Art and Culture, etc. ‚Äì a \\"mere\\" vandalisation and demolition of furnishings, since the synagogue is located inside of a block of residential buildings.Ulrich Eckhardt, Andreas Nachama with Heinz Knobloch and Elke Nord, J√ºdische Orte in Berlin, Berlin: Nicolai, 1996, p. 39. A fire ignited and burning torah scrolls and smashed furniture was soon extinguished before spreading to the actual building.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 39seq. Many windows had been destroyed. Rabbis and other male congregants were arrested and brought to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin mended the synagogue, one of the few little-destroyed ones in Berlin, and reopened it on the eve of Pessach 1939 (3 April).Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 41. Regular Jewish ceremonies could be held until, on 12 April 1940, J√ºdisches Nachrichtenblatt announced that services would not held be any more in Rykestra√üe and in the also reopened New Synagogue until further notice. That was the usual way in which Nazi prohibitions were publicised. The Jewish school in the front building was forced to close in 1941. However, the Jewish community formally remained proprietor of the site. In May 1942 the borough of Prenzlauer Berg declared its will to acquire the site paying the ridiculous sum of reichsmark (‚Ñõ‚Ñ≥) 191,860 and with effect of 1 September 1944 the site was conveyanced to the borough.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 43. When on 6 May 1943 the Jewish community applied at the Gestapo for a sale permission, since all its property was under custodianship as were any sales proceeds, it named the Heeresstandortverwaltung I Berlin (German Army garrison administration no. I) as the tenant of all the site, except of two little apartments in the front building still rented out to residential tenants.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 44. The oft-mentioned usage of the synagogue by the Wehrmacht as a horse barn is not proven and unlikely. There were no premises and remainders found in the synagogue indicating that usage. Instead it is reported that furniture was stored in the prayer hall. The furnishings (chandeliers, lustres, menorot, ner tamid, cupper coverings of doors) of the synagogue made from non-ferrous metal, which was scarce and much needed for war production, were not dismantled.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 45. Post-war The prayer hall lacked most of its benches and the aron kodesh was screened off by a raw provisional wall built after April 1940. Sanitary installations had been dismantled and the destroyed windows exposed the interior to the impact of weather. (1899‚Äì1950, Soviet Gulag), who survived the Shoah living underground, the new president of J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin much promoted the reopening of Rykestra√üe Synagogue. He informed the city council that on Friday, 13 July 1945, the first shabbat ceremony was held, also attended by Soviet City Commander Nikolai Berzarin, however using the better preserved and smaller weekday prayer hall. On 29 July 1945 Rabbi could celebrate the first Jewish wedding there since the closure of the synagogue in 1940. Jewish displaced persons, who survived the Shoa and were stranded in Berlin, used to live in the front building. The great prayer hall was provisionally refurnished with benches. A new central bimah replaced the original one located directly in front of the aron qodesh and thus also screened off by the wall. Services were held on Rosh Hashana 1945 and Pessach 1946, before another closure for a more serious refurbish 1946/1947.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 47seq. In the period of GDR The parochet of the aron qodesh. In 1952 Heinz Galinski, since 1949 president of still undivided J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin, commissioned Heinz Juliusberger, head of its construction department, to prepare and supervise an extensive renovation of the synagogue, being the sole functioning synagogue in the eastern sector of Berlin. Material unavailable in the communist planning system, such as zinc to repair the roof, were bought in West Berlin and brought over.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 48. The provisional wall was demolished reopening the access to the aron qodesh and the original bimah, so that the central bimah, disliked by Riesenburger, could be removed again.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 49. During the course of the anti- Semitic campaigns in Czechoslovakia during the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial GDR authorities arrested and interrogated Jews living in East Germany. The Stasi searched community offices all over the GDR, leading to renewed exodus from the GDR by Jews. West Berlin permitted these migrants and within several months, between 500 and 600 Jews crossed over.556 Jews filed for refuge in West Berlin until March 1953 with prior c. 2,500 Jews in East Berlin and another 2,000 in East Germany proper. Berlin's Chief Rabbi then urged Galinski, who rather maintained a low political profile after the Soviets had deported his predecessor, to warn Jews in the east of the upcoming persecution, which he did by way of a press conference held in West Berlin. Communist Volkskammer deputy (1909‚Äì1979), president of the union of Jewish congregations in East Germany (not including J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin), was interrogated between 6 and 8 January, when GDR officials prompted him to declare in the name of the Jewish community that there is no anti-Semitism in communist states, that Israel is a fascist state and that he acknowledges the Sl√°nsk√Ω trial. Meyer refused and fled to West Berlin in the night after the Doctors' plot started on 13 January 1953.Also the presidents of the Jewish congregations of Dresden, Erfurt, and Leipzig escaped to the West. Hoping to spare themselves from further persecution members of J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin in East Berlin formed a new provisional executive board only competent for the eastern sector on 21 January, thus establishing J√ºdische Gemeinde von Gro√ü-Berlin (i.e. Jewish congregation of Greater Berlin), dividing Berlin's Jewish community. Rykestra√üe congregant Georg Heilbrunn (1887‚Äì1971; brother of the aforementioned Sally Heilbrunn), president of the Rykestra√üe gabba'im, was elected member of the East Berlin community board.Hermann Simon, Die Synagogue Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 49seq. On 25 January the GDR started a wave of arrests of Jews. So there were J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin and J√ºdische Gemeinde von Gro√ü-Berlin, one western one eastern, when Riesenburger re-inaugurated Rykestra√üe Synagogue on Sunday, 30 August 1953, giving it the name \\"Friedenstempel\\"( English: Temple of Peace). Georg Heilbrunn and Israel Rothmann held speeches, the latter praising the great Soviet Union and the GDR government. The latter sent Arnold Zweig and Robert Havemann as its representatives. However, an arson attack on the day before cast a pall on the re-inauguration.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), pp. 50seq. The naming \\"Friedenstempel\\" did not prevail. Stained glass rose window at the southwestern gable of the nave. Further repairs followed in 1957, 1967, but funds for houses of worship were in short supply from an atheistic government. After the erection of the Berlin Wall the number of members of the Jewish community in the eastern sector of Berlin amounted to about 3,000 persons. On Sunday, 11 March 1962 Rabbi Riesenburger, who was also an organist, inaugurated an organ installed for the first time in the preserved location, which he played in concerts of traditional Berlin synagogal organ music.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 17. Still in use today, this instrument, a single keyboarded church organ of famous (Frankfurt upon Oder) is used sometimes for concerts and some religious services as wedding ceremonies. On Tuesday, 1 September 1964, J√ºdische Gemeinde von Gro√ü-Berlin celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Synagogue. Leipzig's Jewish cantor directed the concert of the accompanied by West Berlin's cantors (1918‚Äì2000) or (1921‚Äì2004), with Riesenburger preaching.Hermann Simon, Die Synagoge Rykestra√üe (1904‚Äì2004), Berlin: Hentrich & Hentrich and Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin / Centrum Judaicum, 2004, (J√ºdische Miniaturen; vol. 17), p. 55. After his death in 1965 Riesenburger was succeeded by Rabbi √ñd√∂n Singer. After he returned to Hungary in 1969 the position remained vacant. On 21 September 1976 East Berlin registered Rykestra√üe Synagogue as a monument, so public subsidies flowed for the renovations in 1986/1987. On Rosh haShana 1987 (23 September) Isaac Newman assumed his office as rabbi for J√ºdische Gemeinde von Berlin (after 1970 the Gro√ü had been skipped). However, congregation and rabbi were disappointed of each other so Newman returned to the United States in May 1988. On 25 February 1988 the GDR government reversed the property transfer of 1944, thus J√ºdische Gemeinde von Berlin (East) held again property title to the Synagogue. However, as the long practice showed since 1945, it was not the property title, anyway discretionarily not respected by the communist East German rulers, which allows the de facto usage, but usage depended on the pure goodwill of the rulers. By 1990 the community counted a mere 200 members and had no longer had a rabbi. On 1 January 1991 the small J√ºdische Gemeinde von Berlin (East) and the much bigger J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin (West) reunited. After unification On 12 September 2004 the centenary of Rykestrasse synagogue was solemnly celebrated, cantor Jochen Fahlenkamp singing \\"Adoshem Malach\\" by former Rykestrasse choir conductor and composer Jakob Dymont (1860-1956). The synagogue's interior, which now seats up to 1,074 people, originally sat 2,000. After more than a year of work to restore its prewar splendor, it was rededicated on 31 August 2007, this time as an Orthodox synagogue, with separate seating and an Orthodox Minyan. The inauguration saw rabbis bringing the Torah to the synagogue, in a ceremony witnessed by political leaders and Holocaust survivors from around the world. \\"It is now the most beautiful synagogue in Germany,\\" the cultural affairs director of the J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin, Peter Sauerbaum, said. Today, Berlin has the largest Jewish community in Germany, with 12,000 registered members and eight synagogues. Visiting the synagogue Public tours through the Rykestrasse Synagogue are available on Thursdays between 14:00 and 18:00 and Sundays between 11:00 and 16:00. Tours are offered in German; an English tour starts at 16:00 on Thursdays. Entry is permitted until 17:30 pm and no entry is permitted at any other time. Services are held on Friday nights and Saturday mornings. The Synagogue can easily be accessed by public transport through the underground line U2 (stations Senefelderplatz and Eberswalder Strasse) and the tramway line M2 (stations Knaackstrasse and Marienburger Strasse). List of rabbis serving at Rykestra√üe Synagogue Since the archives of J√ºdische Gemeinde zu Berlin were mostly destroyed following the compulsory dissolution of the community by the Nazi government exact years of office cannot be given. The rabbis also alternately served at other synagogues of J√ºdische Gemeinde, some restricting themselves to only Alter Ritus or Neuer Ritus synagogues, some serving wherever the gabba'im invited them.

It is owned by Boston Properties, who acquired the neighboring Embarcadero Center office, hotel, and retail complex in 1998. Design The design of Embarcadero Plaza is credited to Don Carter (principal-in-charge) with help from Mario J. Ciampi and John Bolles. The original concept was devised by Lawrence Halprin, who described five distinct districts of Market Street in the 1962 report What to do About Market Street starting at the Embarcadero and ending at Van Ness. In retrospect, Halprin's vision for Market was described as a \\"pedestrian-oriented series of linked civic spaces\\" which were later realized as the open spaces running from Embarcadero Plaza (in the northeast) to UN Plaza in the southwest. Halprin described an early concept for what he called Ferry Building Park in the 1962 Market Street report, proposing to bring San Francisco Bay and the original harbor closer to Market, as \\"the [Embarcadero] Freeway and the Ferry building have created an impenetrable barrier, at street level, to one of San Francisco's most priceless assets ‚Äì its marine setting\\" and offering ways to minimize the visual and aural impact of the double-decked freeway. View of Vaillancourt Fountain and Justin Herman Plaza in 1988, matching initial 1972 configuration. Note double-deck Embarcadero Freeway separating plaza from waterfront. The controversial Vaillancourt Fountain dominates the northeast end of the plaza. The large plaza could accommodate large crowds, and the roaring fountain was designed to drown out noise from the Embarcadero Freeway, which was completed in 1959 and ran along the east side of the plaza from its opening in 1972 until the freeway was torn down in 1991. La Chiffonni√®re is also installed in the plaza, closer to Market. A bocce ball court was built using private donations in 2010. Reception During the debate over changing the name, San Francisco Chronicle urban spaces critic John King called it \\"a stark concrete landscape\\" and added \\"there's no earthly reason you would want to be there.\\" In an earlier article published just after Halprin's death in 2009, King noted that Embarcadero Plaza was \\"oversize and stiff, unable to adjust to the changing urban scene on all sides.\\" History The plaza, located at the eastern end of Market Street, opened in 1972. It was originally named for M. Justin Herman, executive director of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency from 1959 to 1971. In 2017, County Supervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution to rename the site Embarcadero Plaza, citing Herman's role in displacing poor and minority residents from the Western Addition, Fillmore, Chinatown, and South of Market neighborhoods while presiding over the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed the resolution unanimously on September 19, 2017. The name Embarcadero Plaza will be temporary until a new official name can be decided upon. The Board's resolution is nonbinding, as the authority to change the name rests with the San Francisco Recreation and Park Commission. Peskin stated he had received an unsolicited text from the owner, Boston Properties, which said they would cover the cost of replacing the plaque bearing Herman's name. The Recreation & Parks Commission voted 4‚Äì2 to remove Justin Herman's name on November 16, 2017. An earlier vote in October ended in a 3‚Äì3 tie after one of the commissioners (who had favored removal of the name) left the meeting before the vote was held. David Johnson, a photographer who documented life in the Western Addition prior to SFRA's redevelopment, is a leading candidate for the renaming of the plaza. Usage Occupy San Francisco encampment (2011) The plaza is frequented by nearby office workers on lunch break and by families with small children. Free daytime concerts occur frequently in the summer, and an ice skating rink is set up for winter months. In 1987, during The Joshua Tree Tour, U2 held a free concert in Justin Herman Plaza to \\"Save the Yuppies\\" following the Black Monday financial crisis in October. During the finale of the impromptu concert, Bono spray-painted graffiti on Vaillancourt Fountain, for which he was fined. Great San Francisco Pillow Fight (2012) During the early 1990s, the plaza was better known as EMB, one of the world's premier street skateboarding sites. Formal athletic ceremonies and rallies have also occurred in the plaza, including the retirement of Joe Montana (1995), attended by an estimated 25,000 people; the commemoration of Barry Bonds becoming the all-time home run leader (2007); and as the site of Super Bowl City, a \\"fan village\\" for attendees of Super Bowl 50 (2016) at Levi's Stadium in distant Santa Clara. Because of its size, the plaza is also frequently used for political rallies, including the Occupy San Francisco protest which took over the plaza for several months in 2011. Recurring events The monthly Critical Mass bicycle rides have started from the plaza since September 1992. Since 2006, on Valentine's Day, the plaza is the site of the Great San Francisco Pillow Fight, an unsponsored annual pillow fight flash mob.

It is mostly not possible to overwrite or otherwise manipulate them.  Pre-declared entity  A pre-declared entity is a built-in notation convention for a character or a string. For example, in the HTML markup language, a large number of character and numeric entities are available to represent characters. In HTML, '&lt;' is a possible pre-declared entity to represent '<'. The programmer must not declare this entity by himself before he can use it, since it is already pre- declared by the specifications of the HTML language. Pre-declared entities are often used as escape sequences to represent information that would otherwise cause possible conflicts in its non-encoded form.  Pre-declared variable  When a variable is pre-declared, it provides the programmer with information that he might be interested in. For example, in the Perl language, a variable %ENV is pre-declared, holding all kinds of environmental information such as the operating system, host information, user information, and many more. Other pre-declared variables in Perl are %INC and %SIG. Almost all common programming languages provide the programmer with such pre-declared variables in one or another form. When variables are pre-declared, it is commonly assumed that the value for the pre-declared name is also pre-assigned at the same time.  Pre-declared object Pre-declared objects have the same goal as pre-declared variables. For example, in the JavaScript language, the navigator-object is available to get all kinds of information about the browser that is running the script in question.  Pre-declared functions and instructions  Pre-declared functions or instructions are built-in tools to perform common tasks. For example, in the earliest programming languages the square root needed to be calculated by hand. Nowadays programming languages have a pre-declared instruction or function for this task. Pre-declared functions or instructions often hold common tasks and their goal is to simplify the work of the programmer. The available pre-declared instructions or functions can in some languages be extended by using external libraries or modules.  Narrow semantic sense  In a narrow strictly semantic sense, the term pre-declared may also refer to the declaration of a variable before an assignment takes place. In the following example, the first line is the (pre-)declaration and the second the assignment: var A; A = 1; By declaring the name A, the program creates a namespace for the variable called A. In most modern languages, the variable does not need to be pre-declared on a separate line, as the following instruction achieves exactly the same: var A = 1; In early computer languages, the variable always needed to be pre-declared as a separate instruction, because the operating system had to reserve a series of bytes in the available RAM, before the actual value of the variable could be stored in it. Declaration and assignment are still two fundamental different things, though they nowadays mostly appear in a same instruction line.

Live Show program In spring 2010 the band started working on a new live program ‚Äì Color Splashes ‚Äì which is a mix of contemporary Nu Jazz and Electronic music. As some critics, as well as the musicians, admit this is the brightest and most colorful live show the band has ever produced. The on- stage line-up consists of Oleg Smirnov (Programming, Bass, Guitars), Vladimir 'BIG' Glushko (drums), Maria Logofet (violin), Anastasia Boguslavskaya (alto sax), Oleg Mariakhin (baritone sax, trumpet), Jon Kukaryamba (percussion, vocals, effects) and band's live soundman ‚Äì Nikita Filippov. The band is now performing shows in clubs and at festivals. The touring line-up however is usually reduced to 4‚Äì5 musicians on stage. The concert debut of this program was released in 2012 as a 4-track concert EP \\"LiveSplashes\\" on a CD and in a 3plet format. The release received numerous acknowledgements and reviews around Russia and the USA. The current touring band consists of 5 musicians on stage and a live sound engineer. The current live show program, as well as reviews, videos and music etc. is available at band's official website. The band released the studio version of \\"COLOR SPLASHES\\" in late 2015. The release was presented at a big solo performance in Moscow Central House of Artists 19 September 2014. Live at Central House of Artist (Moscow, RU) Live at Central House of Artist (Moscow, RU) 2  History  EXIT project was formed in 2001 as an open experimental music community of musicians. \\"Open\\" means that any thoughtful and contented musician could join in and contribute. The point was from the start to create a non-commercial music project. The first lineup was: RO-mix (Guitars, Programming, Vocals), Michael (keyboards, vocals, programming). Soon Michael parted, but in a year the band grew in size, when Oleg Smirnov (Guitars, producer), Vladimir \\"Big\\" Glushko (Drums), Michael \\"Kotovsky\\" Finagin (double bass), Anton Kochurkin (Flute) joined the project.Exit Project. –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞. ‚Äì –£—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∏ The band released the first studio album of EXIT Project ‚Äì \\"Live Electricity\\" (2002) under caring pursuit of the band's manager Valery \\"MIF\\" Mifodovsky.

All the sale proceeds from the album were directed to the WWF program (protection of animals). The album received highly positive reviews from the critics, and the band was identified to have its own unique style by the top music critic and journalist Artemy Troitsky. In 2004 having played some local-scale shows and recorded a demo-release for live show program \\"Quintet \\"Michael \\"Kotovsky\\" Finagin and Anton Kochurkin left the band.Exit Project. –•–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞—è –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞. ‚Äì –î–∏—Å–∫–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—è Exit Project The \\"Quintet\\" was fully live band contrasting predominately electronic first album Live Electricity.

The trio appeared in several remarkable festivals in Russia and Ukraine in 2006 an–≤ was highly noted by the critics as well as publicity. Meanwhile, the second album of the band, Hack The World, which was mostly a studio work. \\"Hack the World\\" was predominantly Electronic music, and was released in 2005 by the declaration FREE!MUSIC 2.1, which allows anyone download and use the music freely. Some of its tracks were used in an audio-story Karandash i samodelkin v Egipte, by Moscow-based art project called Audio-Theater. The album became a success, and the musical journals Salon Audio Video and Avtozvuk released the album in a 50,000 copies edition as an add-on to the journal issue. Songs from the album were also used for the audio-show Space Mowgli based on a story by Strugatsky brothers and in Peoples book based on Yevgeniy Grishkovts's Rivers. However, the album was totally a studio work and the tracks have never been performed live. After the success of Hack The World the band started an active touring career in various venues as well as Russian and Ukrainian jazz, alternative and rock festivals, including InProg (2006), Space of Joy (2006), Pustye Holmi (2006), etc. It was in these days when the unique style of the band was named by the critics as art-fusion. All of a sudden, \\"Ro-mix\\" left the touring band, but kept on his studio musical work, both ‚Äì on his own and together with Oleg Smirnov. At the same time Vladimir \\"Big\\" Glushko and Oleg Smirnov kept the on-stage unit on the move with amazing new members joining in ‚Äì percussionist and showman Jon Kukaryamba (Deti Picasso), bass guitarist Timur Pirogov (Marc Almond), jazz vocalist Katerina \\"Kotya\\" Zinich (26 Hertz), keyboardist Gregory Sandomirsky (Goat's Notes, Lampa Ladino), Alexander \\"Aliss\\" Alekhin (Allisid Jazz) ‚Äì proceeded to contribute to the bands powerful performance. The line-up played many full- scale solo concerts and together with acknowledged Russian iconic avant-garde saxophone player Sergey Letov (Pop Mechanica, Sergey Kurekhin, Saiyenkho, Vladimir Volkov, etc.) performed at the Russia's most prestigious theatre and performing arts festival \\"Golden Mask\\" (2007). This concert was released on a CD three years later as EXIT project \\"Live at Golden Mask\\" by Russia's top record label Soyuz Records. On 22 October 2007, the band together with Sergey Letov were the first to perform at the TV show \\"Brat Jivyom\\" (\\"Taking Alive\\") on the major Russian TV channel O2TV. The official DVD released by the O2TV channel followed this remarkable performance. The following year (2008) this line-up of performers broke up, having naturally completed its agenda. Meanwhile, in 2007 Ro-mix and producer Oleg Smirnov with some other sidemen recorded EXIT project's third studio album Mystery Journey of Girl with her Death (2007). Being primarily a studio work, the sound of the album was a more distortion oriented and included more traditional music elements and song-line compositions. The album had a vast success both in Russia and beyond. In 2008 the new ‚Äì parallel ‚Äì line-up was formed consisting of Oleg Smirnov, \\"Ro-mix\\" and world music and jazz virtuoso Kirill Parenchuk playing soprano sax and Indian percussion instrument tabla. This sub-project was called \\"Shanti Place\\", and was a balanced mix of live electronics and Indian-like instrumental influences. The musicians performed together for about a year at festivals and venues. The band announced the intentions to proceed with the release. The album was released later in 2010 with the name ‚Äì Shanti Place. The same year the drummer Vladimir \\"BIG\\" Glushko formed his own free- improvisation oriented project called \\"personal EXIT\\" engaging various international artists into his spontaneous improvisational performances. In 2009 Oleg Smirnov contributed guitar recording and production expertise to the Marc Almond album Orpheus in Exile. In 2010 the band released the amazing concert album featuring collaboration with avant-garde saxophonist Sergey Letov ‚Äì \\"Live at Golden Mask\\" recorded live in 2007. The tracks were played live for years, but have never been released before. The CD was released by Russian major label Soyuz Records. In 2012 The concert debut of live program was released in 2012 as a 5-track concert EP \\"LiveSplashes\\"http://exitproject.org/albums/livesplashes on a CD and became the first music album to be released in a 3plet format. The release received numerous acknowledgements and reviews around Russia and the USA. The CD was released by Russian major label \\"Soyuz Records\\" . Later in 2012 the band's producer, bandleader and bassist Oleg Smirnov released a studio multimedia project in collaboration with multi-instrumentalist Kirill Parnchuk. The multi-media album \\"Son Cherished Most\\" is a unity of music, visual arts and text citations as well as a 10-minute documentary film revealing the concept and the process of creation.

The film premiered on March 11, 2007, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival, and had its US television premiere on August 29, 2007, on TLC. The film was edited by Pagan Harleman and Brian Fassett. The music was composed by Matthew Puckett. The film tells the story of Carr's battle with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), a vascular cancer in the lining of the blood vessels in her liver and lungs so rare that only 0.01 percent of the cancer population has it. Around 200 to 300 cases are diagnosed in America every year - the cause is unknown.Living with Cancer: Kris Carr's Story Kris Carr has also written two books, Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips, based upon the film, and Crazy Sexy Cancer Survivor.Excerpt: \\"Crazy Sexy Cancer Survivor\\" (abc news) Plot summary Crazy Sexy Cancer is the personal video diary of Kris Carr, a young actress, photographer, and filmmaker. Carr's struggle with cancer begins after a visit to the doctor, following a particularly difficult yoga class. Initially thinking it was a yoga-related injury, Carr is devastated to learn she has a rare form of cancer, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). Despite its rarity, Carr is told that her tumors are not behaving aggressively, and so her doctor advises that she \\"watch and wait\\" for two months before having more tests to determine whether the tumors change, grow, or remain the same.Stein, Lisa. Scientific American Special Edition. June 2008 Special Edition, Vol. 18 Issue 3, p6-13 Despite the grim prognosis, Carr refuses to accept her sickness as an end to her life, and sets out to explore alternative methods with which to fight her cancer. After her doctor recommends she start taking care of her body with diet and exercise, Carr is determined to \\"take that crumb and turn it into a cake.\\"Carr, Kris. Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips. Skirt Publications, 2007. Her first stop out of the doctor's office is a shopping trip to the organic grocer Whole Foods. Her careful and precise monitoring of her food intake allows her a sense of control which she finds comforting. Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma As Carr discovers at the beginning of the film, she has a rare form of cancer called epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE). In Kris Carr's case, she has tumors affecting the blood vessels in her liver and lungs. From the doctor's explanation, her liver has so many tumors it looks like Swiss cheese. EHE is so rare, it is only diagnosed 200 to 300 times a year, or to about .1 percent of the population. Characteristics of the cancer include a tumor that rarely metastasizes and is very difficult to diagnose. As is the case with Kris Carr, it is \\"most often an incidental finding in young asymptomatic women.\\"Lopes, T, et al. \\"Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma - rarity, diagnosis and treatment difficulties.\\" Revista Portuguesa De Pneumologia [Rev Port Pneumol] 2009 Nov-Dec; Vol. 15 (6), pp. 1167-74. Finding a doctor Kris Carr conducts her search for an oncologist almost as if she were conducting a job interview. She makes it clear that what she does not want is a doctor that will focus on the negative aspect of her illness, and instead searches for a doctor that will support her in her plan to live her life to the fullest. One doctor suggests she undergo a triple organ transplant (both her lungs and her liver), an idea that Carr does not take a liking to, particularly because it is so invasive and not necessary. She eventually finds Dr. George Demetri, director of the Center for Sarcoma and Bone Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, and his optimism about Carr's situation allows for a great relationship between doctor and patient. \\"Healing Junkie\\" Carr refuses to sit back and wait for her body to be ravaged by her cancer. When her doctor tells her to try to boost her immune system by changing her diet and lifestyle, Carr clings to this hope with as much fervor as possible. She starts by ditching her old habits of turning to convenient \\"low-fat\\" diet foods and trades it in for a new vegan diet. She enrolls in a healing program by Hippocrates Health Institute in West Palm Beach, Florida and immediately her refrigerator is filled with such foods as \\"leafy greens, vegetables, sprouted grains, nuts, seeds, and every kind of juice possible, including tons of wheatgrass.\\"Carr, Kris. \\"Fearless.\\" Natural Health April 2008 Alternative medicine In addition to her new diet, Carr also adopts a new, healthier way of life that includes detoxing her body through exercise and alternative medicine. She subjects herself to enemas as well as treats herself to massages and new-wave therapies such as infrared saunas. She sees a chiropractor and an acupuncturist, all in pursuit of finding an alternative way to battle her illness. While it is yoga that initially brings Carr to her diagnosis, it also helps Carr in her healing process. Yoga becomes a part of her daily activities. In addition to improving her physical well-being, Carr approaches her cancer with a certain amount of spirituality. She visits a Zen Monastery, and even develops her own \\"special space\\" where she spends at least 10 minutes every day praying, meditating, and giving thanks for her family, friends, and the life she lives. As she describes in both her film and her books, Cancer is her guru. As Carr describes it, \\"Cancer creates pandemonium.\\"Carr, Kris. Crazy Sexy Cancer Survivor: More Rebellion and Fire for Your Healing Journey. Skirt Publications, 2007. Instead of succumbing to the cancer, Carr says, you should use it for your spiritual growth, an idea that Carr adopted well in her healing journey. Crazy sexy life In the movie, Carr emphasizes the importance of having a \\"cancer posse.\\" In addition to documenting her own personal illness narrative, Carr also interviews other young women who suffer from cancer, and how they have chosen to live with it as though it were a blessing rather than a curse. Crazy Sexy Cancer is Carr's first piece of work. Her other publications include two books titled, Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips and Crazy Sexy Cancer Survivor: More Rebellion and Fire for Your Healing Journey. These books include articles and introductions by other famous female cancer survivors, including Sheryl Crow, Marisa Acocella Marchetto, Diem Brown, Jackie Farry, and many more. In addition to the film and books, Carr has essentially pioneered an entire online community intended to support other strong-willed women in their fight against cancer. When Carr was originally diagnosed, she felt alone and confused in her struggle. Healing narrative Crazy Sexy Cancer is a film that focuses on \\"healing\\" (in a spiritual sense of the word) rather than the illness itself. This film is more than a story of a woman with cancer. As the film progresses, so does Carr herself, and we see how in the end it is the cancer that heals Carr. Some ideas and themes that are seen throughout Crazy Sexy Cancer include: Optimism ‚Äì The tone of the entire film is upbeat. Carr chooses to approach her illness with optimism almost immediately. Despite her fear surrounding her initial diagnosis, her first step toward healing is finding a doctor that does not resort to negative thoughts. This theme of optimism surrounds Carr for the majority of the film. In one scene, Carr looks directly at the camera and proclaims ‚ÄúI am NOT sick!‚Äù over and over again. She describes one doctor's diagnosis of a 100% fatality rate as ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù, and she jokes with the cameramen as she proclaims that her personal ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù is Whole Foods. There are moments of vulnerability for Carr just as there are ups and downs for anyone dealing with an illness, but for the most part these moments are forgotten when compared to her moments of empowerment and strength. At one point in the movie, Carr discusses with her oncologist the topic of spontaneous remission, the idea that cancer can basically improve or disappear on its own, despite what the diagnosis might be. Dr. Demetri tells her that sometimes doctors tend to search for the negative. Carr and her doctor work together to focus on how Carr can live her life to its fullest. Control- The idea of empowerment over illness is a theme that radiates throughout the film. As soon as her doctor tells her that one part of her body she can control is what she eats and how she lives her life, Carr immediately transforms her diet and lifestyle. While she cannot control the tumors themselves, she can control the body that harbors these tumors. New Self- On the outside, there is no difference between Kris Carr's pre-diagnosis body and post-diagnosis body. She was diagnosed at the age of 31. Not only this, but Carr made a living off of her looks. She was a model and actress and had recently been shown a glimmer of fame when she appeared in two Budweiser commercials that aired during the Super Bowl. Now, she faces cancer and all the questions that inevitably accompany such a disease. Throughout the film, we see a transformation in Carr. Saying goodbye to her old life of partying and unhealthy lifestyle choices, Carr embraces her new self as a ‚Äúhealth junkie.‚Äù As Kris describes in an article, ‚ÄúEven though I have cancer, I have never felt healthier.‚Äù Kris also must adjust her life to the idea that she is living with cancer. Carr's case is not like a normal cancer case. She was not given a certain number of months to live, and all she can do about her cancer is wait and see what happens. Her doctor tells her she could live her entire life with cancer. As Carr films her experience, she has a creative outlet with which she can make sense of it. This documentary is a form of therapy for Carr, and therefore is a healing narrative in itself. As Rita Charon states in her book, Narrative Medicine, \\"as it takes away, illness also gives searing clarity about the life being lived around it.\\"Charon, Rita. Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illness New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. p. 97 When Carr calls cancer her \\"guru\\", she means that while her cancer makes her physically ill, it is through this illness that she becomes spiritually and mentally strong.

Information The traction engine was a four-pole, three-phase, 525-volt AC induction motor, weighing 143 pounds (65 kg), with a maximum speed of 24,000 rpm; it had an aluminum housing, was lubricated by oil, and had an 8:1 motor to final drive ratio. Electrical power was supplied by a water-cooled, three-phase alternator which was built into a two-stage gas turbine, fueled with liquified natural gas, running at 50,000 rpm at low speed and 100,000 rpm at high speed, weighing 186 pounds. Additional energy for acceleration was provided by a 147-pound SatCon composite flywheel housed in a vacuum chamber running at 58,000 rpm, coupled to the drive train via three- phase permanent magnets in a Halbach array.Modern Chrysler Concept Cars: The Designs That Saved the Company, by Matt DeLorenzo, Motorbooks, 2000, , In 1995 SatCon and Chrysler were awarded the Discover Award for innovation in automotive engineering for the Patriot design. The Patriot as first designed was different in many details from the final design, which had numerous compromises, according to its creator, Chrysler engineer Ian Sharp, who wrote that similar designs appear to be under consideration for Formula One racing in 2012. Although introduced with much fanfare as a great leap forward in alternative energy storage and efficiency, press releases regarding the Patriot faded away. It was later revealed that serious problems with the mechanical integrity of the flywheel could not be overcome, and protection from a shattering flywheel would exact too much of a weight penalty. It is not to be confused with the Jeep Patriot, a 2007 SUV built by the same company.

Early life Michael Perry was born in Beckenham, Kent on 8 March 1942. He was educated at Dulwich College and went on to study at University College London; Oak Hill Theological College, London; Ridley Hall, Cambridge; and University of Southampton.Michael Perry at Jubilate Group website It was during his student days at Oak Hill in 1964 that Perry wrote his best-known hymn, the Calypso Carol, the first line of which is \\"See him lying on a bed of straw\\".Obituary , The Hymn Society He wrote this for a college concert, and it only became famous by accident when Cliff Richard substituted it for a missing recording in a radio show. Ministry After ordination in the Church of England Diocese of Liverpool, Perry ministered at St Helens, Merseyside. He moved to Bitterne, Southampton, Hampshire, where he was curate and then vicar. During his time at Bitterne he was on the committees that produced the popular hymn books Psalm Praise (1973) and Hymns for Today's Church (1982). From 1981 to 1989 Perry served as Rector of Eversley, Hampshire. In 1982 he became Secretary of Jubilate Hymns, and was involved in editing most of their books. In addition, he worked as Chaplain and lecturer at the National Police Staff College, Bramshill. He was also elected to the Church of England's General Synod in 1985. Perry's last posting was as Vicar of Tonbridge in his native Kent from 1989 until 1996. He was appointed Chairman of the Church Pastoral Aid Society in 1993, and again to the General Synod in 1994. Personal life Perry married Beatrice Mary at St Helens Parish Church in 1967. They had two children, Helen and Simon. From early 1996 Perry was increasingly disabled by an inoperable brain tumour. He died at home on 9 December 1996. Legacy His contemporary, hymn-writer Christopher Idle, paid tribute to Perry's compositions, his constructive criticism of others' works, and his business acumen in \\"sorting out what had been a copyright jungle\\" (referring to critics who expected songwriters to make no charge since their work was \\"for the Lord\\"). He concluded that few people matched Perry's influence on evangelical praise and worship over the 1970s to '90s.Christopher Idle, \\"Not just a calypso\\", obituary of Michael Perry in Evangelicals Now, February 1997 Selected works Perry wrote over 300 hymns.

Early life and college years Nelson was born in Beaumont, Texas and began taking piano lessons at an early age. It was not until high school that he began to play guitar on a regular basis. After moving from Texas to Florida, Nelson attended Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida, where he began making a name for himself in the local music circuit.

She turned pro 1 June 2004. Masters is from Bearsted in Kent, England. Masters has been playing on the European tour since 2004 and enjoyed two full successful seasons playing across the world, mainly in Europe. On her third year after earning well in year 1 and an increased amount in year 2, in mid-2008 at BMW Ladies Italian Open in Argentario Golf Resort & Spa she had to pull out of the event due to a back injury. Due to the severity of the injury she was unable to play again that season. In an attempt to get back playing as soon as possible, Masters saw a number of experts, ranging from sports science injury specialists to chiropractic physicians, none of whom could offer much help. After a number of scans it was clear she had suffered a subluxated disc, which was caused by an underestimated ankle problem. Due to the nature of the injury, time was given as the prognosis. A few months into the recovery process Masters, due to a number of factors (unhappy with recovery and felt no improvements were being made), had an appointment with a physiotherapist she had been recommended. After just a few treatments with the new physio she was able to set a target to return at the esteemed Dubai Ladies Classic (Emirates Golf Club) in mid December. The goal proved a little too much and she had to pull out after only one round completed. The injury had kept her out of over half the events for that calendar year and she was not able to earn enough to retain her playing rights. The rule which prohibited Masters from playing the following year was removed within a year of it being introduced. Despite a very detailed and compelling dossier submitted for a medical exemption, the case wasn't even considered due to the ephemeral 10 Events Ruling. In 2009 Masters played in 1 LET Event at the Tenerife Ladies Open, Golf Costa Adeje, in which Felicity Johnson was the winner. In March of that year she got married in her home town. At the end of 2009 Masters returned to Tour School in an attempt to regain her card. The event was held at La Manga Golf Resort and after 7 competitive rounds of golf and from a field of over 220 players across the week she made it into the top 50. In turn she earned playing rights for 2010.

He has been producing music since the mid-1970s with a style which has been described as \\"soft and sweet\\" with a strong folk influence. Rotenberg grew up in Queens, New York, surrounded by other up and coming religious Jewish musicians, including Eli Teitelbaum, who directed the first Pirchei boys choir, as well as Rabbi Baruch Chait and Label Sharfman who attended yeshiva with him. Rotenberg studied piano and taught himself guitar at a young age. Interview for JE magazine, December 31, 2005 ,  Musical career  Rotenberg has cited the musicians Rabbi Ben Zion Shenker and Shlomo Carlebach as strong influences. While his folk-inspired sound and inspirational lyrics are strongly reminiscent of Carlebach, Rotenberg's soft and sometimes melancholic voice, however, contrasts with Carlebach's ecstatic style. Rotenberg has collaborated with other Jewish musicians including Mordechai ben David, Avraham Fried, Yehuda Schechter, Yaakov Shwekey, Baruch Levine, Moshe Yess and Shlomo Simcha with whom he co-starred in Israel National Radio's Miracles 18 concert. Rotenberg has also been a main fixture of the annual HASC A Time for Music concerts. He has produced a children's audio series called the Marvelous Midos Machine comprising four volumes, with all original material. Rotenberg said that wanted to raise awareness of different traits inherent in each child through this series. He also produced the children's audio CDs The Golden Crown and The Lost Treasure.  Writing career  In September 2015, Rotenberg published his first novel, The Season of Pepsi Meyers, a book about an 18-year old Jewish boy playing for the New York Yankees, set in the future (Feldheim Publishers). In November 2016, Rotenberg released Eliyahu Hanavi, under his full name Avraham Yom Tov Rotenberg, an in-depth analysis of the life of Elijah the Prophet (Mesorah Publishers). Later, it became apparent that this was a mistake in publicity, since most people did not associate him with his full Hebrew name Avrahom Yom Tov, and thought it was another author.

He had a promising baseball career before injuries, deep slumps, and frequent trades forced his premature retirement. He served in military during World War II (Pacific). Signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent in 1946, Kryhoski hit .396 with 19 home runs and 85 runs batted in with the Wellsville Yankees of the PONY League that season. As a member of the 1948 Kansas City Blues of the American Association, he hit .294 (160-for-545) with 30 doubles, seven triples, 13 home runs and 87 runs batted in. In 1949 he hit .328 with five home runs and 50 runs batted in with the Pacific Coast League Oakland Oaks, joining the New York Yankees late in the season. The Yankees won the 1949 World Series when Kryhoski was a rookie with them. During the off-season, he was traded by New York to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Dick Wakefield. Kryhoski played with Detroit from 1950 to 1951, before joining the St. Louis Browns (1952‚Äì53), Baltimore Orioles (1954) and Kansas City Athletics (1955). One of his most productive seasons came in 1951 with the Tigers, when he hit .287 with 12 home runs and 57 runs batted in, batting third in the batting order. Then, in 1953 he shared with Roy Sievers the first base job for the Browns in the last year of the team's existence. On July 16 of that year, the Browns tied, by then, a majors record with three successive home runs belted by Clint Courtney, Kryhoski and Jim Dyck, in the first inning of an 8‚Äì6 victory over the Yankees. In a seven-season major league career, Kryhoski was a .265 hitter (475-for-1794), 45 home runs and 231 runs batted in over 569 games, with 203 runs, 85 doubles, 14 triples, five stolen bases, and a .314 on-base percentage. As a first baseman, he collected 3768 outs, 312 assists, 394 double plays, and 40 errors in 4120 total chances for a .990 fielding percentage.

This mycotoxin occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of deoxynivalenol is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, both of which are important plant pathogens which cause fusarium head blight in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn. The incidence of fusarium head blight is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. However, increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of vomitoxin in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins. Gautam, P. and Dill-Macky, R. 2012. Impact of moisture, host genetics and Fusarium graminearum isolates on Fusarium head blight development and trichothecene accumulation in spring wheat. Mycotoxin Research 28 (1) Furthermore, deoxynivalenol contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, tillage practices, and fungicide use.Beyer M, Klix MB, Klink H, Verreet J-A (2006): Quantifying the effects of previous crop, tillage, cultivar and triazole fungicides on the deoxynivalenol content of wheat grain ‚Äì a review.

It occurs abundantly in grains in Norway due to heavy rainfall.http://www.vkm.no/dav/eee04d10c4.pdf F. graminearum grows optimally at a temperature of 25 ¬∞C and at a water activity above 0.88. F. culmorum grows optimally at 21 ¬∞C and at a water activity above 0.87. The geographical distribution of the two species appears to be related to temperature, F. graminearum being the more common species occurring in warmer climates. Deoxynivalenol has been implicated in incidents of mycotoxicoses in both humans and farm animals.  Mechanism of action  Vomitoxin belongs to a class of mycotoxins (trichothecenes) which are strong inhibitors of protein synthesis; exposure to vomitoxin causes the brain to decrease its uptake of the amino acid tryptophan and, in turn, its synthesis of serotonin. Reduced levels of serotonin are believed to be responsible for the anorexic effects of DON and other trichothecenes. Irritation of the gastrointestinal tract may also play a role in reducing food intake, and may also partially explain the high incidence of paraesophageal stomach ulcers observed in sows during food refusal. In humans DON is extensively glucuronidated and excreted via urine.  In food  When compared to other trichothecene mycotoxins which can form in grains and forages, vomitoxin is relatively mild. Reduced feed intake, with its accompanying decrease in performance, is the only symptom of vomitoxin toxicity livestock producers will likely encounter. This response to vomitoxin appears to occur through the central nervous system. * Human foods: Vomitoxin is not a known carcinogen as with aflatoxin. Large amounts of grain with vomitoxin would have to be consumed to pose acute toxicity in humans. Currently, the effects chronic of low-dose exposure are unknown. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has established a level of 1 ppm (parts per million) restriction of vomitoxin.Citation needed * Companion animals: Dogs and cats are restricted to 5 ppm and of grains and grain byproducts and the grains are not to exceed 40% percent of the diet. * Livestock and farm animals: In animals and livestock, vomitoxin causes a refusal to feed and lack of weight gain when fed above advised levels. Restrictions are set at 10 ppm for poultry and ruminating beef and feedlot cattle older than four months. Ingredients may not exceed 50% of the animal's diet. Dairy cow feed limits are set at 2 ppm.

Other venues have included the Chester Fritz Auditorium at the University of North Dakota and the Empire Arts Center in Downtown Grand Forks. In addition to the mainstage productions, accredited classes for high school students are offered. A middle school/junior high program and elementary school program are also offered. In addition, the Grand Cities Children's Choir operates as a division of SPA. \\"GCCC\\" features several separate choirs that have regular concerts and special tours. The SPA is an eight-week summer arts program available for students in the elementary, middle and high schools in Grand Forks, North Dakota and the surrounding communities. These programs are instructed by staff from the Grand Forks region (including the Grand Forks Public Schools and the University of North Dakota), as well as special guests from around the country. SPA produces several theatrical performances each year, as well as a series of concerts. Other performance opportunities also exist for students. There are many classes in a variety of areas, including vocal and instrumental ensembles, visual arts, and technology. Individual lessons on voice or an instrument are provided as well. SPA is offered through the Grand Forks Public Schools, and graduation credits are earned by students for their work. Elementary SPA Elementary SPA (grades K-5) is a two-week exploratory workshop full of activities such as creative dramatics exercises and theatre games. Students develop characters, create plays, and perform for each other on a daily basis. Also, on the last day there is a student-prepared public performance. Middle School SPA Middle School SPA (grades 6-7) is a four-week session focusing on drama, dance, and music. The focus of this program is process rather than product, so emphasis is placed on training. The end performance is a show and tell of what they have learned throughout the session. High School SPA High School SPA (grades 8-11) runs for two months, and hours of participation can vary greatly depending on the level of involvement. High school offerings include: * Classes, such as vocal ensembles, steel drums, music theory, and jazz dance. * Vocal lessons * Backstage work on a technical crew * On-stage participation in a musical theatre piece SPA Mentoring The SPA Mentoring Program is designed to create opportunities for students to develop positive peer and adult relationships. All SPA participants have access to mentoring activities. As part of the program, at-risk students can be referred to the program by a counselor, teacher, or parent, and one-one-one attention is given to these students by trained mentors. Quick Facts Approximately 6,537 students have participated in the Elementary SPA program from 1987‚Äì2007. These figures, combined with student lesson totals and the Grand Cities Children's Choir, give an approximate number of 11,754 students that have participated in the program from 1987‚Äì2007. In 1988, SPA had 30 participants and 13 staff members. In 2007 there were 1,333 students and 50 staff members. A student who participates in the SPA program from Kindergarten or first grade until he/she graduates from high school will spend the equivalent of an entire school year with the program. SPA has given over 325 public performances to over 111,500 audience members. There have been 904 staff members of the SPA program. Of these 904 staff members, 456 were alumni of the SPA program. Keep the Faith The program has gained national recognition for its production of Keep the Faith, a musical written by SPA staff and area composers and musicians after the historic 1997 Red River flood.

EMR1 is a member of the adhesion GPCR family. Adhesion GPCRs are characterized by an extended extracellular region often possessing N-terminal protein modules that is linked to a TM7 region via a domain known as the GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain. EMR1 expression in human is restricted to eosinophils and is a specific marker for these cells. The murine homolog of EMR1, F4/80, is a well- known and widely used marker of murine macrophage populations.

EMR2 is a member of the adhesion GPCR family. Adhesion GPCRs are characterized by an extended extracellular region often possessing N-terminal protein modules that is linked to a TM7 region via a domain known as the GPCR- Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN) domain. EMR2 is expressed by monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells and all types of granulocytes. In the case of EMR2 the N-terminal domains consist of alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domains. EMR2 is closely related to CD97 with 97% amino-acid identity in the EGF-like domains. The N-terminal fragment (NTF) of EMR2 presents 2-5 EGF-like domains in human. Mice lack the Emr2 gene. This gene is closely linked to the gene encoding EGF-like molecule containing mucin-like hormone receptor 3 EMR3 on chromosome 19.  Ligand  Like the related CD97 protein, the fourth EGF-like domain of EMR2 binds chondroitin sulfate B to mediate cell attachment. However, unlike CD97 EMR2 does not interact with the complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor CD55, and indicating that these very closely related proteins likely have nonredundant functions.  Signaling  Inositol phosphate (IP3) accumulation assays in overexpressing HEK293 cells have demonstrated coupling of EMR2 to GŒ±15. EGF-like module-containing mucin-like hormone receptor-like 2 (EMR2) is an adhesion GPCR that undergoes GPS autoproteolysis before being trafficked to the plasma membrane. Further, distribution, translocation, co-localization of the N-terminal fragment (NTF) and N-terminal fragment (CTF) of EMR2 within lipid rafts may affect cell signaling. Mutations in the GPS have shown that EMR2 does not need to undergo autoproteolysis to be trafficked, but loses function. EMR2 has been shown to be necessary for in vitro cell migration. Upon cleavage the N-terminus has been shown to associate with the 7TM, but to also dissociate, giving two possible functions. When the N-terminus dissociates it can be found in lipid rafts. Additionally, the cleaved EMR2 protein 7TM has been found to associate with EMR4 N-terminus.  Function  The expression of EMR2 and CD97 on activated lymphocytes and myeloid cells promotes binding with their ligand chondroitin sulfate B on peripheral B cells, indicating a role in leukocyte interaction. The interaction between EMR2 and chondroitin sulfate B in inflamed rheumatoid synovial tissue suggests a role of the receptors in the recruitment and retention of leukocytes in synovium of arthritis patients. Upon neutrophil activation, EMR2 rapidly moves to membrane ruffles and the leading edge of the cell. Additionally, ligation of EMR2 by antibody promotes neutrophil and macrophage effector functions suggesting a role in potentiating inflammatory responses.  Clinical significance  EMR2 is rarely expressed by tumor cell lines and tumors, but has been found on breast and colorectal adenocarcinoma. In breast cancer, robust expression and different distribution of EMR2 is inversely correlated with survival.

When the storms had passed, she would wade in the water as far as she could to rescue trapped seamen from their doomed ships. After marrying a widower and taking on the care of his six children, she settled in a trapper's cabin on Long Point, Lake Erie. On 23 November 1854, with her husband away, she single-handedly rescued the seven-man crew of the Buffalo-based schooner Conductor, which had run aground in a storm during the night. The crew had clung to the frozen rigging in the darkness and, despite her inability to swim, she waded chin-high into the water after dawn to help the stricken sailors reach shore. In another incident, four sailors arrived at the door of the Beckers' cabin, in the midst of a severe fall gale and snowstorm. Apparently they were only four of six survivors from a schooner that had gone ashore during the night, but two of them had given up and collapsed a mile or so from the cabin. Abigail invited the four in to warm up by the fire, and then set off in the snowstorm with two of her boys and some warm clothing, to find the other survivors. Miraculously, despite the severity of the storm and resulting limited visibility, she was able to locate the two and coerced them to get up and go on, practically pushing them back to her cabin. All of the sailors survived.Dwight Boyer, \\"True Tales of the Great Lakes\\". Freshwater Press, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, 1971. During another late autumn gale, a schooner laden with barley went ashore near the Becker cabin. All hands were rescued except for the cook, a woman, who went unaccounted for. One morning one of Abigail's daughter's came running back to the cabin crying, \\"Mother! Mother! There's a woman in the schooner waving her arms at me!\\" Abigail, not really believing her child, went to investigate anyway. She peered down the open hatch of the wreck to find the cook, floating upright, her arms waving gently as the level changed with the heave of the seas through the broken hull. She was awarded several medals for her heroism and the people of Buffalo collected $350 for her by public conscription. The New York Life Saving Benevolent Association struck a gold medal in Abigail's honor, and the Royal Humane Society did likewise. When on a duck-hunting trip to Long Point, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), made a point to meet with Abigail to present her with a gift. Queen Victoria sent her a handwritten letter of congratulations and ¬£50 as a reward. She put the money towards buying her own farm. After losing her husband, Jeremiah Becker, to a storm on the lake in January 1864, she raised seventeen children alone. (At the age of seventeen, Abigail married Jeremiah, who already had six children ‚Äì one girl and five boys. She and Jeremiah had an additional eight children together ‚Äì five boys and three girls. A few years after Jeremiah's death, Abigail married Henry Rohrer, with whom she had three more daughters. The story of the Conductor rescue is told in the song \\"The Angel Of Long Point\\" by Canadian band Tanglefoot, and in the song \\"Abigail\\" by Canadian Americana/Folk singer Tia McGraff.

It is just off a point on the side of cliffs in the West Cliff residential area near downtown Santa Cruz, providing easy access and a good vantage point for viewing. The Santa Cruz Surfing Museum is housed in a lighthouse there. \\"Steamer Lane\\" is the preferred form of the name used by the people surfing there.Lead of Surfline article, accessed 2007-08-31. Steamer Lane was named by Claude Horan while he was a student at San Jose State in the late 1930s. One flat calm day he and his friend Wes Hammond thought it would be a good idea to hire steamships to cruise back and forth to generate waves for surfing. It was at Steamer Lane that the modern surfing wetsuit and the leash were mainly developed by Jack O'Neill, who had his surf shop nearby for many years.

The home was designed to provide safe, inexpensive lodging for sailors, and to offer educational and recreational opportunities, in contrast to the temptations on offer in the docklands area. The home was not only a magnificent building it also played a pivotal role in establishing Liverpool as one of the world's successful commercial seaports following the dismantling of the Slave trade. The building was demolished in 1974, a few years after its closure in 1969. Decorative features were preserved. Mermaid Railings from the Home (Acquired by Clough Williams-Ellis C1950 when a floor was installed at first floor balcony level.) can be seen in Portmeirion in North Wales. The wrought iron gates were sold in 1951 to Avery in Birmingham and were on view at their museum located in the historic Soho Foundry until 2011. During their working years the gates had been associated with two deaths, helping to create the story of subsequent hauntings around Canning Place. In 2011 the gates were returned to Liverpool and installed as \\"The Sailors' Home Gateway\\" near their original location in Liverpool One, as a monument to the thousands of Merchant Seamen that had passed through them during the 150 years the Sailors' Home operated. The sandstone Liver Bird originally at the centre of the flamboyantly carved decoration above the doorway can be found in the Museum of Liverpool. History The Liverpool Sailors‚Äô Home project was launched at a public meeting called by Liverpool‚Äôs Mayor in October 1844. The need for a Sailors‚Äô Home had been identified: > to provide for seamen frequenting the port of Liverpool, board, lodging and > medical attendance, at a moderate charge; to protect them from imposition > and extortion, and to encourage them to husband their hard-earned wages; to > promote their moral, intellectual, and professional improvement; and to > afford them the opportunity of receiving religious instruction. A reading- > room, library, and savings bank will be attached to the institution; and > with a view to securing to the able and well-conducted seamen a rate of > wages proportionate to his merits, a registry of character will be kept. > Among the ulterior objects in contemplation are schools for sea-apprentices, > and the sons of seamen, with special regard to the care of children who have > lost one or both their parents receiving religious instruction. As well as providing safe accommodation for an average of 200 men each night, the home provided a vital service, introducing professional, experienced merchant seamen to captains of safe seaworthy vessels. This combined with the expansions of its docks, greatly improving the reputation and efficiency of Liverpool as a merchant port. Construction Liverpool-based architect John Cunningham (1799-1873) was involved with the Liverpool Sailors‚Äô Home project from the institution‚Äôs inception, having been appointed architect of the building in 1844 even before land for the building had been secured. Originally from Scotland, from his arrival in the city in 1834 until his retirement in 1872, Cunningham designed a number of the City's most important buildings including the first railway stations at Edge Hill and Lime Street, the Philharmonic Hall and the Liverpool Sailors‚Äô Home. The Home was created in the neo-Elizabethan Tudor style. During the construction of The Liverpool Sailors' Home (1845‚Äì52), it is clear from contemporary reports that John Cunningham, worked closely with Henry Pooley Jnr. on the designs of the iron- work: \\"three tiers of ornamental cast-iron pilasters with an intermediate range of galleries, filled in with ornamental cast-iron work depicting nautical themes characteristic of the purpose of the building, thereby forming six floors for dormitories, capable of accommodating on each floor forty-four cabins.\\" Pooley and Cunningham also worked together to re-build the Homes' interior following the disastrous fire of April 1860 which closed the building for two years. The Destruction of the Liverpool Sailors' Home on 12 May 1860 Despite later accounts of his success, Pooley's relationship with the Home was not always a smooth one. Pooley‚Äôs heating apparatus for the building was not finished on time and even when completed, for the Homes‚Äô belated opening in the winter of 1852, was described by the Sailors‚Äô Home Committee as not fit for purpose. Another piece of Pooley and Cunningham‚Äôs handiwork had a flaw which resulted in rather more than inconvenience. The Gates The entrance gates to the Sailors' Home were elaborate decorative pieces of ironwork which served the dual purpose of protecting the Savings Bank and keeping out seamen who might wish to gain entry to the Home after the strict 10 pm curfew. By April 1852 the lower sections of the gates had been installed, decorated with a combination of elements from the interior balconies; four great panels of rope-work with central mermaid and trident figures identical to those inside. The two outer panels were fixed whilst the two centre sections rolled behind them on rails where they were hidden from sight while the Home was open for business. The iron-work of the lower gates, being on such a large scale, produced a solid, intimidating aspect compared with the much lighter appearance of the balcony railings. The huge mass of iron made an impassable barrier but also a massive weight and it would have taken some effort to slide the gates open and close. The upper part of the gates which reflect the sandstone carvings above the entrance were added later and show a much lighter touch, using the spaces between the iron to great effect. The Minutes of Sailors' Home Management Committee contain the following entry: 25 April 1852 - \\"Mr. Akin laid upon the Table a note from Mr. Pooley and 2 notes from Mr. Cunningham with a plan for supporting the arch over front gate way. When the superintendent expressed his fears as to the consequences which might result from the proposed spikes upon the top of the gate to drunken belated boarders, and also as to the sufficiency of pillar supports resting upon the top of the gate itself. After some consideration, the matter was referred to Mr. Mann who kindly offered to consult with Mr. Cunningham. \\"By the following meeting on May 3 Cunningham had confirmed that he would alter the plan for supporting the front arch and on May 24 he was given permission to proceed with the alterations to the front gateway. It was agreed that Mr. Pooley would have the contract. Although spikes, so frowned on by the Committee, were fixed to the top of the original gates, Cunningham and Pooley's new upper section elegantly blocked all the area above the entrance making access impossible when the gates were closed. They also supported the stone work of the entrance arch, which appears to have had a structural weakness. 1852: An Unfortunate Death of Mary Ann Price The Minutes of Sailors' Home Management Committee, contain the following entry: ‚Äú1852 July 14 - \\"Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Pooley were present in reference to the accident of the falling of the outer gate upon Mrs Price, causing her death. From the explanations given, it seems to have arisen in the neglect of Mr. Pooley's foreman to replace the stop which was carried away when the gate fell before and in the hook attached to the chain having by frequent jerking opened and become detached from the loop upon the gate. Resolved - That Mr. Cunningham & Mr. Pooley arrange an effectual stop for front gate, and that they give a note conjointly, to the effect that the gate shall be made perfectly secure.\\" The report of the inquest before P.F.Curry on the death of Mrs Price, which appeared in The Liverpool Courier July 14, 1852 failed to mention Pooley's neglect: > Mary Ann Price, 52 years of age. John Price, the husband of the deceased, is > porter at the Sailors' Home. On the night of Sunday the 12th, between eight > and nine O'clock, he was closing the ornamental gate, (which is massive > iron, and divided into three compartments) with his wife, his daughter, and > her child, standing by his side. There was a chain which should have been > hooked on to the wall to prevent the gate sliding out of the grooves but > this must have been detached by some person unknown to him during the period > of divine service. > He was shutting the gate in the usual way, when the centre compartment > slipped out of the groove and fell upon his wife and daughter, both of whom > were taken to the South Hospital where the deceased died next morning from > the injuries which she had received. The verdict of the inquest was that Mrs Price had been \\"Accidentally Killed\\". Not only had the gates fallen off prior to killing the unfortunate Mrs Price, but even after her death Pooley's were slow to react. \\"Resolved - That a note be sent to Mr. Pooley to remind him, and to express the extreme disappointment of the Committee that this has been neglected after the late lamented accident.\\" Minutes of Sailors‚Äô Home Committee Meeting July 21, 1852 Despite the obvious mechanical problems causing of the fatal accident, The Home‚Äôs Committee thought that action should be taken against the individual responsible for the gate falling. It was not Mr. Pooley or his foreman that were brought to account but the unfortunate doorkeeper, Joseph Clark who was suspended and replaced by William Elliot at 18/- per week. This might have been all that could be written about Cunningham and Pooley‚Äôs entrance gates until their removal after World War 2, but lightning was to strike twice. 1907: The Tragic Death of Constable Locke In the Annals of the Sailors' Home, printed in the Home's annual report for the year 1935, against the year 1907 was the following entry: November - Police Officer Locke killed through front gate falling upon him. The following is taken from contemporary accounts: ‚ÄúEarly on the morning of Sunday the 24th of November, nearly an hour after midnight, Police constable number 324A, Brownlow Locke, of the Liverpool City Constabulary, met his death in a very strange and unexpected manner.‚Äù ‚ÄúConstable Locke had gone on duty at 5.45 pm. on Saturday evening. A heavy downfall of hail occurred at the time when the porter of the Sailors' Home came out to close the outer gate, which was a solid and heavy iron structure, opened and shut by being wheeled across the opening. The constable, it appears, had left his waterproof cape at another part of his beat, and had stood inside the entrance of the Sailors' Home to shelter from the storm. Seeing the porter unable to pull the mid section of the gate into place, the officer went to his assistance but had evidently given so strong a pull that the gate had run sharply and snapped the hold back chains, one of which was tied with rope. The gate overshot the guide and toppled outwards from the top. The porter during the operation was inside and the policeman outside the gate. Seeing it begin to fall over, the porter made a grab at it, but was overpowered by the heavy mass, and sustained some injury in being carried with it, while the officer, being beneath, sustained the whole impetus of the downfall. Being a mass of metal weighing about half a tonne, the gate crushed the officer so severely that he was at once rendered unconscious.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhen removed on the ambulance to the Royal Southern Hospital it was found that the injuries, consisting of a fracture of the 'scull' and internal injuries, so serious as to preclude the hope of recovery. About 1.30 on Sunday morning Thomas Locke, who was also a constable in the City Force, was informed that his brother had been injured and taken to Hospital. He immediately proceeded to the institution. His brother, who was unconscious, expired a few minutes after he arrived. Locke, who originally came from Widnes, was described as a very promising officer of twenty six years of age, who had four years' service. He left a widow and one child. The victim of the calamity was the fourth member of his family in police service, two brothers serving in the Liverpool Constabulary and one in St. Helens.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe heavy mass of iron which caused the officer's death lay prone alongside of the front of the building for some time and was an object of curious investigation by morbid passers-by who knew of the sad affair.‚Äù ‚ÄúConstable Locke was buried three days after the accident at Anfield Cemetery. The coffin was conveyed from his home in Rutland-street on one of the Fire Brigade's hose carriages, which was covered with wreaths. About 200 of the deceased's colleagues in uniform followed the cortege. Large numbers of people assembled all along the route. The neighbourhood of the deceased was crowded by sympathetic friends. The chief mourners were the widow and the mother of the deceased and his three brothers (Police-constables Robert, Alfred, and William Locke). Many police officials also attended included two Chief Superintendents. Among others present was Mr. Hanmer, the manager of the Sailors' Home. Wreaths were sent from the Liverpool Police Divisions and from the Sailors' Home.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the inquest on the constable‚Äôs death, Mr. A. E. Frankland representing the Home, stated that 'he wished to take the opportunity on behalf of the management of the Sailors' Home of expressing their great regret at the accident and also their deep sympathy with the deceased's relatives'. 55 years after the death of Mrs Price the repairs performed by Mr. Pooley's foreman had failed and the gates had claimed a second victim.\\" Despite fierce public declarations on December 5 the Committee met to consider the suggestion of Mr. Duder's (the prosecuting solicitor) that the Home should make an offer to the Policeman's widow. After discussing the matter and consulting with Mr. Pedder who advised there was no legal liability in the matter, it was decided that he should see Mr. Duder and repudiate liability but ascertain whether the widow would be prepared to accept an ex gratia payment as a mark of the Committee's sympathy - any such payment to be without prejudice in every way to the legal position of the Committee of the Home. The secretary was instructed to have the gate inspected by Killick and Cochran and to obtain from them an estimate for ‚Äúmaking it secure against such an accident in future\\". At the next meeting of the Committee on December 23: \\"The Chairman reported that in regard to the Policeman's widow, the matter was still in process of settlement. The Chairman presented Messrs. Killick and Cochran's suggestion an estimate for placing a new wrought iron top guide rail for gates, the Secretary was instructed to request them to proceed with the work at once and to ascertain if they consider the ground runners in good order and also if the new chains supplied by them had been tested and to what extent. A certificate was obtained from the Mersey Chain Testing Works, dated January 21/08 giving the test applied to the chains of the front gate as proof strain applied 6 Cwt, Safe load 3 Cwt the secretary reported that Messrs. Killick & Cochran had told him the chains were amply strong for the purpose. At the same time the Chairman presented the report and balance sheet for 1907, which was passed subject to ¬£ 100 being carried to a suspense to cover a grant for Policeman Locke's widow and costs.\\" Other authorities also made provision for the Constable's widow, but they were not overgenerous. The Merseyside Police Pensions Index for January 20, 1908, records a gratuity of ¬£25 4 shillings paid to Ellen Locke widow of Constable Locke aged 25. Visitors to Anfield Cemetery will look in vain for any monument to Constable Locke, whose grave is unmarked despite the unusual nature of his passing and the pomp and ceremony of his burial. Disturbed by the death of Constable Locke the Chairman approached the Homes' solicitors Messrs. Weightman, Pedder & Co. to determine their liability with regards to third parties having accidents whilst in the Home. The news was not good for the individual Committee members. They were personally liable for the consequences of the negligent action of their servants and liable for injuries happening in consequence of the defective condition of the premises. Fearing the financial penalties in the event of other accidents the Committee quickly resolved that a policy be taken out for ¬£1000 for anyone accident and a maximum of ¬£2000 in one year. Records do not show if a claim was ever made against this policy. 1951: The Gates Move to Their New Home in Sandwell As part of the repair to War Damage following the Liverpool Blitz it was decided to remove the gates. On March 25, 1948 W & T Avery who had swallowed-up Pooley's and Sons were offered the gates by the Sailors' Home Committee. On May 18, 1949 Avery's made an offer of 50 guineas for the gates, which was accepted on May 3. 1951. On June 11, 1951 it was reported that the gates were 'quite improperly' holding up the archway above them, and considerable work would be necessary before they dare be removed by the Sailors' Home Contractors. Despite this report the gate had been in place for nearly one hundred years and had supported the entrance arch, just as John Cunningham and Henry Pooley Jnr. had intended when they set down their plans in April 1853. On December 1. 1951 the gates were finally loaded on to a lorry for transport to the Avery Historical Museum in Soho, Birmingham. These magnificent gates were altered to swing open like conventional doors rather than slide apart as originally intended; the chains which would have prevented them sliding too far were however still present. Photographs of the gates in Birmingham show the mermaids on the four iron panels had suffered fin loss and other signs of damage, which older photographs from 1941, show occurred before the move. This may be malicious damage caused by seamen angry at being locked out of the Home after curfew, or during the three occasions, two of them deadly, when the chains failed to stop the massive doors coming off the rails. Demolition of the Sailors' Home The home was demolished between 1974 and 1975, and the site then remained unused for over 30 years, until the construction of Liverpool One. Sailors' Home gates return to Liverpool Gates at Liverpool One In the summer of 2010, following Sandwell MBC‚Äôs concerns about the condition of the gates and corrosion of their supporting structure, the structure was dismantled and taken to Barr & Grosvenor Ltd‚Äôs foundry in Wolverhampton for restoration under the guidance of the company‚Äôs head, Dominic Grosvenor. The ¬£32K estimated cost of the restoration was borne by Avery. The gates could have either been returned to Avery‚Äôs historic Soho Foundry site or to the St Thomas's Church memorial garden, close to the replica of the 1850s Liverbird carving which stood above the building's entrance. Liver bird from the Sailors' Home, Liverpool (2) In March 2011 Officers at Sandwell Council approved an application to have the Sailors' Home Gates relocated to Liverpool as they felt the gates would have more significance to the community in their home city than in Sandwell. After restoration the gates were returned to Liverpool on 8 August 2011 and were re-erected under the name \\"The Sailors Home Gateway\\" in the pedestrian section of Paradise Street in Liverpool One, close to the original site of the Sailors' Home.BBC News - return of gatesLiverpoolConfidential.com - return of gates References External links *History and Pictures *Liverpool Sailors' Home Flickr site *Campaign to return Historic Henry Pooley Gates to Liverpool from Sandwell Group *Pooley Gates Website *Black Merchant Seamen's Memorial on Sailors' Home carving *Replica of Sailors' Home Liverbird at St Thomas's Church memorial. *Contemporary Account of the Sailors' Home fire. *Sailors' Home paper by Stephen Mckay in 2020 Journal of the Antique Metalware Society.

It is based on the 1946 book of the same name. Background In her Autobiography, Christie claimed that the success of And Then There Were None set her on the path of being a playwright as well as a writer of books and that only she would adapt her works for the stage from then on and that The Hollow would be her next play.Christie, Agatha. An Autobiography. (Page 472). Collins, 1977. In writing this, Christie forgot her intervening plays of Appointment with Death (1945) and Murder on the Nile (1946) in addition to Moie Charles and Barbara Toy's 1949 adaptation of Murder at the Vicarage. Christie had always felt that The Hollow would make a good play but she came up against the opposition of her daughter, Rosalind Hicks, who Christie affectionately described as having \\"had the valuable role in life of eternally trying to discourage me without success\\". Christie was determined to turn the book, which both she and Rosalind liked, into a play but was equally adamant that in doing so it would lose the character of Hercule Poirot whose appearance in the book she thought had \\"ruined it\\".Autobiography. (Page 473). The parts of the policemen were changed from the book as well from Inspector Grange and Sergeant Clark to Inspector Colquohoun and Detective Sergeant Penny. Bertie Meyer, a backer of plays whose association with Christie's stage works dated back to Alibi in 1928, signed a contract to produce The Hollow in 1950 and plans were made with Christie's agent, Edmund Cork, to open the play in London to coincide with the start of the Festival of Britain. These plans came to nothing and Christie was annoyed at the treatment she was starting to receive from Meyer on this and his slow response to staging another play she had written, Towards Zero.Saunders, Peter. The Mousetrap Man. (Page 108) Collins, 1972. Meyer turned it down as he believed that it would be too difficult to cast, although it has been speculated that the anti-Semitism in the novel was the primary reason, him being Jewish. During the year, Peter Saunders, a young and new theatrical producer had sustained a significant loss when he staged an adaptation by Dan Sutherland of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1913 book, The Poison Belt. Desperate to make up these losses, he cast around for a play that he could take on tour which would not involve too much expense and which would be sure to attract a paying audience. Charles and Toy's adaptation of Christie's Murder at the Vicarage was just about to finish a four-month run at the Playhouse Theatre and, desperate to minimise his costs, he hit upon the idea that the name of the actors who starred in the production wouldn't really matter as Christie herself was enough of a public name to attract the audience. He therefore deliberately advertised the play as Agatha Christie's \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" rather than \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" by Agatha Christie. This small piece of showmanship worked. He recouped his losses and, more importantly, brought himself to the attention of Christie who, annoyed with the slow progress of Bertie Meyer, gave The Hollow to Saunders instead.Saunders. (Pages 106‚Äì108) Saunders faced great difficulties in staging the play, including refusals to assist in casting or finance from colleagues in the theatrical world who felt that the piece was badly written. One problem was the casting of the star part of Lady Angkatell and it was Saunders who hit upon the idea of Jeanne De Casalis, a choice that Christie did not accept at first but which she later admitted was right.Saunders. (Pages 112‚Äì113) The play opened at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge on 10 February 1951 although Christie was absent as she was in Iraq accompanying her husband Max Mallowan on one of his archaeological expeditions. She arranged for flowers to be sent to the female members of the cast. Hundreds of miles away, she was as nervous as ever at the public reaction although she was reassured by telegrams which told her that the opening night was a success. Even so, Saunders and director Hubert Gregg had to make some amendments to take out some of the unintentional comic moments that had occurred on the first night.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 288) Collins, 1984 . After an eight-week tour, the play opened at the Fortune Theatre in London on 7 June 1951 to an enthusiastic press response. It transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre on 8 October 1951Saunders. (Pages 114‚Äì115) and ran for a total of eleven months and 376 performances,Book and Magazine Collector. Issue 174. September 1998 enabling Christie to see it on her return. One special thrill for Saunders was a request by Queen Mary, a noted Christie fan, to see the play and she came to the Fortune Theatre to do so and met various members of the cast in the interval. Christie herself was so pleased at the efforts that Saunders made that she took him to lunch just after Christmas 1951 and gave him a brown paper package. Inside it was the script for a new play she had just written, The Mousetrap.  Synopsis  The action of the play passes in the garden room of Sir Henry Angkatell's house, The Hollow, about eighteen miles from London. Time: the present. ACT I *A Friday afternoon in early September The play begins with Henrietta Angkatell (Henry's younger cousin, in her 30s) working on a sculpture and Sir Henry Angkatell reading a newspaper. Lucy Angkatell, Henry's wife, soon enters and makes some characteristically disjointed statements about moles in the garden. Discussion reveals that a number of guests will be arriving to spend the weekend at The Hollow. The first guest to arrive is Midge Hardcastle, another cousin to the Angkatells. The group reflects on a portrait of Ainswick, an estate once inhabited by Lucy Angkatell. Midge and Henrietta remember Ainswick fondly as well, having spent a part of their childhood or adolescence there. Gudgeon, the butler, soon shows in the next guest, Edward Angkatell, yet another cousin and the current owner and resident of Ainswick. It is made clear that Midge is in love with Edward, but Edward is in love with Henrietta. The Angkatell clan briefly leaves the stage, and Gudgeon returns with a maid in training, the working- class Doris. A car is heard, and Gudgeon greets the final guests, John and Gerda Cristow, a successful but condescending doctor and his slow-witted wife. After establishing that John doesn't think much of Gerda's intelligence, he departs, and Henrietta enters and warmly greets Gerda. Henrietta gives Gerda a statuette for which she had previously posed. John, Sir Henry, and Midge return from the garden, and John expresses disdain for the statuette. To break the tension, Henry mentions that film star Veronica Craye is currently residing nearby, in a cottage called Dovecotes. John and Henrietta find themselves alone on stage, and after John reveals that he and Veronica Craye were once lovers, it becomes apparent that he and Henrietta are currently having an affair. Edward walks in on an intimate moment between the two, and John leaves. Edward tries to convince Henrietta to return with him to Ainswick, but is rebuffed. Henrietta leaves to get dressed for a formal dinner, and Sir Henry and Midge come onstage. Midge discusses her employment at a dress shop, rejecting her cousins' pleas to accept their financial support and aristocratic lifestyle. As the Angkatells and Cristows all return to the stage, Veronica Craye makes a surprise appearance. She complains that her cottage has lost power, and her lighter is not working, and so is in need of matches. While waiting for Gudgeon to return with the matches, Veronica notices John, and reveals their past to the group. She asks John, dazed by her appearance, to come over after dinner. He assents, and the act ends as Veronica departs and the rest of the cast goes to dinner. ACT II *Scene 1 ‚Äì Saturday morning John Cristow enters, quickly followed by Gudgeon who bears a note that displeases John. Midge enters, and John goes off in search of Henrietta. Lucy enters, and reveals to Midge that she saw John return to the house at three in the morning. Sir Henry then passes through the room with a pair of revolvers on his way to the shooting range, revealing that Lucy is an accomplished markswoman while convincing Midge to join him at the targets. Henrietta enters as shots are heard from off-stage, quickly followed by Gerda who is alarmed by the gunfire. Henrietta convinces Gerda to try shooting, and the two leave for the target alley. John enters and begins to write letters as Lucy leaves with a basket of eggs. Veronica enters, interrupting John and revealing that she sent the note delivered by Gudgeon at the top of the act. Veronica's lighter is now working, and she reveals that her residence at Dovecotes was part of a plot to reunite with John. She expresses an interest in leaving her current husband and marrying John, but John rebuffs her, expressing a newfound satisfaction with his marriage and regret over the romantic activities of his overnight visit to Dovecotes. Veronica leaves in a rage, but not before threatening John with the telling line, \\"If I can't have you, no one shall.\\" John finds himself alone, hears a noise from offstage, and goes to investigate. Gunshots are heard, and as John staggers and collapses, a revolver is thrown onstage. Gerda is the first to enter, and picks up the revolver. The entire cast quickly enters, and John musters the strength to call the name \\"Henrietta.\\" Henrietta wrests the revolver from Gerda, and Gudgeon calls for a doctor as the curtain falls. *Scene 2 ‚Äì Later the same day The curtain rises on Lucy, Edward, Henrietta, and Midge, sitting in an uncomfortable silence. Lucy expresses admiration for Inspector Colquhoun, the Scotland Yard detective investigating the murder. Gudgeon enters with lunch, and he and Lucy exchange clandestine comments about Lucy's basket of eggs. Lucy and Edward express the opinion that Gerda, having been discovered holding a gun near John after the shooting, is his murderer, while Henrietta insists that Gerda deserves a chance to defend herself. Gerda enters, soon followed by Sir Henry and Inspector Colquohoun. Colquohoun recommends that Gerda hire a solicitor before making a statement, but she declines, and describes her entrance as the audience observed immediately after the shooting. Gerda states that there was no disagreement between her and John in response to Colquohoun's queries. Colquohoun then asks to question Lucy who, delighted with the intrigue, readily complies. They leave with Sir Henry, leaving Edward and Henrietta alone. It becomes apparent that both knew about John and Veronica's rendezvous, Edward expresses sympathy for Henrietta's loss, and Henrietta has an emotional breakdown over John's death. Henrietta leaves as Midge enters. Edward pines for Henrietta while comforting Midge in fatherly way. She attempts to overcome his preconceptions, pointing out that she is \\"not a child\\" any more. Edward is called away to be questioned by the inspector, and Henrietta returns from a walk. She and Midge discuss Edward's misplaced affections, and Henrietta recommends that Midge be more bold with her advances. Lucy replaces Henrietta onstage, and expresses a desire for Henrietta and Edward to marry, ensuring that the Ainswick estate will remain in the family. The inspector enters with Police Sergeant Penny. They question Midge, who conceals her knowledge of John's affair with Henrietta, but acknowledges that John's final words were Henrietta's name. The police are left alone on stage. They note that Edward denies Cristow having any final words, while Sir Henry backs Midge's version of events. Henrietta returns, responds frankly to the inspector that she and John were romantically involved, and asserts that Gerda remains oblivious to the affair. Upon her departure, Colquohoun confides to Penny that the identity of the murderer is still unclear. Gudgeon enters, and hypothesizes that a mysterious handbag found on the sofa may belong to Veronica Craye. Fortuitously, Veronica appears, having heard about the murder. She claims John was obsessed with her, and that she had to rebuff his offer of reconciliation. She claims ownership of the handbag, but becomes irate when Colquohoun reveals a gun he found in the bag. Veronica storms out, refusing to comment further without a lawyer. ACT III (The lights are lowered during the act to denote the passing of one hour.) *The following Monday morning The curtain rises on Inspector Colquohoun and Sergeant Penny looking at the portrait of Ainswick, and discussing the estate's inheritance. Doris enters, reveals that she saw Gudgeon carrying a revolver the day of the murder, and quickly leaves. Sir Henry enters, and upon being questioned about his firearm collection, says that the gun Gerda was holding at the time of the murder was among them, and that he had brought it to the target alley but had subsequently found it missing. Coulqouhoun states that ballistics evidence prove it was not the murder weapon after all. At Coulqouhoun's request, Henry checks his collection again, and discovers that a second gun of the same calibre is missing. Colquohoun shows him the gun found in Veronica's handbag, and Henry confirms that it is one and the same gun. Colquohoun then questions Gudgeon about Doris' earlier statement; Gudgeon confirms the event, saying he was simply up (having found the gun laying out), and had simply forgotten the incident. Lucy enters, dismisses Gudgeon, and reveals that the butler has been attempting to cover for her ‚Äì the gun had been in her basket of eggs, though she claims not to remember why. When the detectives are gone, she confides to Henry that she had thought John might have an accident involving the basket, but that she would never actually go so far as to commit murder. Edward and Midge soon find themselves alone on stage. Edward's affections have changed, and he and Midge become engaged. Lucy enters, and is delighted by the news. Midge and Henrietta have a private conversation, and Midge begins to suspect that Edward has only proposed to create the illusion that he is not in love with Henrietta, which might be a motive for him to have murdered John. By the time Edward returns, Midge is convinced of this motivation, and calls off their engagement. Edward is distraught, and returns to the stage with a gun, clearly contemplating suicide. Midge finds him, confesses her fears, and the two reconcile. All depart for the formal inquest into the murder, and the lights fade. An hour later Gerda and Henrietta enter. Henrietta asks Gerda what she has done with the holster of the murder weapon, stating that if they can get rid of that, there will be no evidence, and no one will be convicted of the murder. Gerda feigns ignorance, but Henrietta is persistent. Gerda tells Henrietta that the cut up scraps are in her leatherworking bag, and confides that she witnessed John's infidelity with Veronica, and therefore had to kill him. Henrietta goes offstage to get some tea to calm Gerda's frazzled nerves. Gerda, thinking she is unobserved, takes a vial of poison from her purse, and pours some into Henrietta's drink. Henrietta returned more quickly than Gerda expected, and witnesses this silently from just outside the room. She enters, more noisily this time. Vocalizing her decision to have tea with Gerda, rather than the sherry she had poured for herself, she leaves to get another teacup. Gerda picks up a revolver, but Inspector Coulquouhoun enters and takes it from her. Upon hearing that Veronica Craye will not be convicted of the murder (she somehow knows about the gun in Veronica's handbag), Gerda begins to go into a hysterical fit, calling for her deceased husband. Inspector Colquohoun unknowingly offers the poisoned drink to Gerda, who drinks it before she realises what she has done. Henrietta returns, and explains the poisoned drink to Colquohoun, who reveals that he had deduced Gerda's guilt from her character. Lucy enters, and the lights go down as the inspector calls the police station. Reception The Times reviewed the play in its issue of 8 June 1951. The reviewer felt that a chorus who stated the suspect's motives in any stage whodunit would \\"spare the author trouble and the audience tedium\\" but went on to say that, \\"once the fatal shot has been fired and the police arrive to ask questions there can be nothing but admiration for the impudent skill with which she directs suspense first this way, then that, and yet contrives to let certainty arrive in due course with an effect of genuine surprise.\\" The reviewer described the play as an \\"ingenious entertainment\\" although admitting that there was \\"no very high polish on the performance\\" of the actors.The Times 8 June 1951 (Page 6) Credits of London production Director: Hubert Gregg Cast:Christie, Agatha.

Despite the different approaches, many of the psychosocial processes in the groups are the same. Self-help groups have had varying relationships with mental health professionals. Due to the nature of these groups, self-help groups can help defray the costs of mental health treatment and implementation into the existing mental health system could help provide treatment to a greater number of the mentally ill population.  Types  Mutual support and self-help Mutual support or peer support is a process by which people voluntarily come together to help each other address common problems. Mutual support is social, emotional or instrumental support that is mutually offered or provided by persons with similar mental health conditions where there is some mutual agreement on what is helpful. Mutual support may include many other mental health consumer non- profits and social groups. Such groups are further distinguished as either Individual Therapy (inner-focused) or Social Reform (outer-focused) groups. The former is where members seek to improve themselves, where as the latter set encompasses advocacy organizations such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness and Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association. Self-help groups are subsets of mutual support and peer support groups, and have a specific purpose for mutual aid in satisfying a common need, overcoming a shared handicap or life-disrupting problem. Self-help groups are less bureaucratic and work on a more grassroots level. Self-help Organizations are national affiliates of local self-help groups or mental health consumer groups that finance research, maintain public relations or lobby for legislation in favor of those affected.  Behavior Control or Stress Coping groups  Of individual therapy groups, researchers distinguish between Behavior Control groups (such as Alcoholics Anonymous and TOPS) and Stress Coping groups (such as mental health support groups, cancer patient support groups, and groups of single parents). German researchers refer to Stress Coping groups as Conversation Circles. Significant differences exist between Behavioral Control groups and Stress Coping groups. Meetings of Behavior Control groups tend to be significantly larger than Stress Coping counterparts (by more than a factor of two). Behavior Control group members have a longer average group tenure than members of Stress Coping groups (45 months compared to 11 months) and are less likely to consider their membership as temporary. While very few members of either set saw professionals concurrently while being active in their group, Stress Coping members were more likely to have previously seen professionals than Behavior Control group members. Similarly, Stress Coping groups worked closer with mental health professionals.  Member vs professional leadership  Member leadership. In Germany, a specific subset of Conversation Circles are categorized as Talking Groups (Gespr√§chsselbsthilfegruppen). In Talking Groups all members of the group have the same rights, each member is responsible only for themselves (group members do not make decisions for other group members), each group is autonomous, everyone attends the group on account of their own problems, whatever is discussed in the group remains confidential, and participation is free of charge. Professionally led group psychotherapy. Self- help groups are not intended to provide \\"deep\\" psychotherapy. Nevertheless, their emphasis on psychosocial processes and the understanding shared by those with the same or similar mental illnesses does achieve constructive treatment goals. Interpersonal learning, which is done through processes such as feedback and confrontation, is generally deemphasized in self-help groups. This is largely because it can be threatening, and requires training and understanding of small group processes. Similarly, reality testing is also deemphasized. Reality testing relies on consensual validation, offering feedback, seeking feedback and confrontation. These processes seldom occur in self-help groups, though they frequently occur in professionally directed groups.  Professional affiliation and group lifespan  If self-help groups are not affiliated with a national organization, professional involvement increases their life expectancy. Conversely, if particular groups are affiliated with a national organization professional involvement decreases their life expectancy. Rules enforcing self-regulation in Talking Groups are essential for the group's effectiveness.  Typology of self-help groups  In 1991 researchers Marsha A. Schubert and Thomasina Borkman created five conceptual categorizations for self-help groups.  Unaffiliated groups  Unaffiliated groups are defined as self-help groups that function independently from any control at state or national levels, and from any other group or professionals. These groups accept all potential members, and everyone has an equal opportunity to volunteer or be elected. Leaders serve to help the groups function by collecting donations not through controlling the members. Experiential knowledge is mostly found, and there is a high emphasis on sharing. An example of an unaffiliated group includes Wildflowers' Movement in Los Angeles.  Federated groups  Federated groups have superordinate levels of their own self-help organization at state or national levels which makes publicity and literature available. The local unit of the federated self-help group retains full control of its decisions. These groups tend to rely on experiential knowledge, and professionals rarely directly interact. The leaders of these groups would be any members comfortable with the format and willing to accept responsibilities. Leaders do not need to have formal training to gain their title. Examples of a federated self-help group would be Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) and Recovery International.  Affiliated groups  Affiliated groups are subordinate to another group, a regional or national level of their own organization. Local groups conform to the guidelines of the regional/national groups. Leaders are self- helpers not professional caregivers, and meetings included educational activities and sharing, supplemented by research and professionals. Examples of an affiliated self-help group would be the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).  Managed groups  Managed groups are based on a combination of self-help and professional techniques. These groups are populated generally through referrals and group activities are led by group members. Managed groups do not meet all the criteria for self-help groups, and so should be designated professionally controlled support groups. Examples of managed groups are common with support groups in hospitals, such as those with breast cancer survivors and patients that may be managed by a nurse or therapist in some professional fashion.  Hybrid groups  The hybrid group has characteristics of the affiliated and managed groups. Like affiliated groups, hybrid groups are organized by another level of their own organization. To participate in specialized roles, training is developed by a higher level and enforced through trained leaders or facilitators. Like a managed group, a hybrid group cooperates and interacts with professionals, and that knowledge is highly valued alongside experiential knowledge.  Group processes  No two self-help group are exactly alike, the make-up and attitudes are influenced by the group ideology and environment. In most cases, the group becomes a miniature society that can function like a buffer between the members and the rest of the world. The most essential processes are those that meet personal and social needs in an environment of safety and simplicity. Elegant theoretical formulations, systematic behavioral techniques, and complicated cognitive-restructuring methods are not necessary. Despite the differences, researchers have identified many psychosocial processes occurring in self-help groups related to their effectiveness. This list includes, but is not limited to: acceptance, behavioral rehearsal, changing member's perspectives of themselves, changing member's perspectives of the world, catharsis, extinction, role modeling, learning new coping strategies, mutual affirmation, personal goal setting, instilling hope, justification, normalization, positive reinforcement, reducing social isolation, reducing stigma, self-disclosure, sharing (or \\"opening up\\"), and showing empathy. Five theoretical frameworks have been used in attempts to explain the effectiveness of self-help groups. # Social support: Having a community of people to give physical and emotional comfort, people who love and care, is a moderating factor in the development of psychological and physical disease. # Experiential knowledge: Members obtain specialized information and perspectives that other members have obtained through living with severe mental illness. Validation of their approaches to problems increases their confidence. # Social learning theory: Members with experience become credible role models. # Social comparison theory: Individuals with similar mental illness are attracted to each other in order to establish a sense of normalcy for themselves. Comparing one another to each other is considered to provide other peers with an incentive to change for the better either through upward comparison (looking up to someone as a role model) or downward comparison (seeing an example of how debilitating mental illness can be). # Helper theory: Those helping each other feel greater interpersonal competence from changing other's lives for the better. The helpers feel they have gained as much as they have given to others. The helpers receive \\"personalized learning\\" from working with helpees. The helpers' self-esteem improves with the social approval received from those they have helped, putting them in a more advantageous position to help others. A framework derived from common themes in empirical data describes recovery as a contextual nonlinear process, a trend of general improvement with unavoidable paroxysms while negotiating environmental, socioeconomic and internal forces, motivated by a drive to move forward in one's life. The framework identified several negotiation strategies, some designed to accommodate illnesses and others designed to change thinking and behavior. The former category includes strategies such as acceptance and balancing activities. The latter includes positive thinking, increasing one's own personal agency/control and activism within the mental health system.  Relationship with mental health professionals  A 1978 survey of mental health professionals in the United States found they had a relatively favorable opinion of self-help groups and there was a hospitable climate for integration and cooperation with self-help groups in the mental health delivery system. The role of self-help groups in instilling hope, facilitating coping, and improving the quality of life of their members is now widely accepted in many areas both inside and outside of the general medical community. The 1987 Surgeon's General Workshop marked a publicized call for egalitarian relationships with self-help groups. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop presented at this workshop, advocating for relationships that are not superordinate-subordinate, but rather emphasizing respectful, equal relations. A survey of psychotherapists in Germany found that 50% of the respondents reported a high or very high acceptance of self- help groups and 43.2% rated their acceptance of self-help groups as moderate. Only 6.8% of respondents rated their acceptance of self-help groups as low or very low. Surveys of self-help groups have shown very little evidence of antagonism towards mental health professionals. The maxim of self-help groups in the United States is \\"Doctors know better than we do how sickness can be treated. We know better than doctors how sick people can be treated as humans.\\"  Referrals  A large majority of self-help users use professional services as a gateway to self-help services, or concurrently with professional service or the aftercare following professional service. Professional referrals to self-help groups thus can be a cost-effective method of continuing mental health services and the two can co-exist within their own fields. While twelve-step groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous make an indispensable contribution to the mental and/or substance use (M/SU) professional services system, a vast number of non-twelve-step groups remain underutilized within that system. Professional referrals to self-help groups for mental health are less effective than arranging for prospective self-help members to meet with veterans of the self-help group. This is true even when compared to referrals from professionals familiar with the self-help group when referring clients to it. Referrals mostly come from informal sources (e.g. family, friends, word of mouth, self). Those attending groups as a result of professional referrals account for only one fifth to one-third of the population. One survey found 54% of members learned about their self-help group from the media, 40% learned about their group from friends and relatives, and relatively few learned about them from professional referrals.  Effectiveness  Self-help groups are effective for helping people cope with, and recover from, a wide variety of problems. German Talking Groups have been shown to be as effective as psychoanalytically oriented group therapy. Participation in self-help groups for mental health is correlated with reductions in psychiatric hospitalizations, and shorter hospitalizations if they occur. Members demonstrate improved coping skills, greater acceptance of their illness, improved medication adherence, decreased levels of worry, higher satisfaction with their health, improved daily functioning and improved illness management. Participation in self-help groups for mental health encourages more appropriate use of professional services, making the time spent in care more efficient. The amount of time spent in the programs, and how proactive the members are in them, has also been correlated with increased benefits. Decreased hospitalization and shorter durations of hospitalization indicate that self-help groups result in financial savings for the health care system, as hospitalization is one of the most expensive mental health services. Similarly, reduced utilization of other mental health services may translate into additional savings for the system. While self-help groups for mental health increase self-esteem, reduce stigma, accelerate rehabilitation, improve decision-making, decrease tendency to decompensate under stress, and improve social functioning, they are not always shown to reduce psychiatric symptomatology. The therapeutic effects are attributed to the increased social support, sense of community, education and personal empowerment. Members of self-help groups for mental health rated their perception of the group's effectiveness on average at 4.3 on a 5-point Likert scale. Social support, in general, can lead to added benefits in managing stress, a factor that can exacerbate mental illness.  List   Emotions Anonymous  Emotions Anonymous (EA) is a derivative program of Neurotics Anonymous and open to anyone who wants to achieve emotional well-being. Following the Twelve Traditions, EA groups cannot accept outside contributions.  GROW  GROW was founded in Sydney, Australia, in 1957 by a Roman Catholic priest, Father Cornelius Keogh, and people who had sought help with their mental illness at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. After its inception, GROW members learned of Recovery, Inc. (the organization now known as Recovery International) and integrated its processes into their program. GROW's original literature includes the Twelve Stages of Decline, which state that emotional illness begins with self-centeredness, and the Twelve Steps of Recovery and Personal Growth, a blend of AA's Twelve Steps and will-training methods from Recovery International. GROW groups are open to anyone who would like to join, though they specifically recruit people who have been in psychiatric hospitals or are socioeconomically disadvantaged. GROW does not operate with funding restrictions and have received state and outside funding in the past. Neurotics Anonymous Neurotics Anonymous is a twelve-step program open to anyone with a desire to become emotionally well. According to the Twelve Traditions followed in the program, Neurotics Anonymous is unable to accept outside contributions. The term \\"neurotics\\" or \\"neuroses\\" has since fallen out of favor with mental health professionals, with the movement away from the psychoanalytic principles of a DSM-II. Branches of Neurotics Anonymous have since changed their name to Emotions Anonymous, which is currently the name in favor with the Minnesota Groups. Groups in Mexico, however, called Neur√≥ticos An√≥nimos still are referred to by the same name, due to the term \\"neuroticos\\" having a less pejorative connotation in Spanish. This branch continues to flourish in Mexico City as well as largely Spanish-speaking cities in the United States, such as Los Angeles.  Recovery International  Recovery, Inc. was founded in Chicago, Illinois in 1937 by psychiatrist Abraham Low using principles in contrast to those popularized by psychoanalysis. During the organization's annual meeting in June 2007 it was announced that Recovery, Inc. would thereafter be known as Recovery International. Recovery International is open to anyone identifying as \\"nervous\\" (a compromise between the loaded term neurotic and the colloquial phrase \\"nervous breakdown\\"); strictly encourages members to follow their physician's, social worker's, psychologist's or psychiatrist's orders; and does not operate with funding restrictions. Fundamentally, Low believes \\"Adult life is not driven by instincts but guided by Will,\\" using a definition of will opposite of Arthur Schopenhauer's. Low's program is based on increasing determination to act, self-control, and self-confidence. Edward Sagarin compared it to a modern, reasonable, and rational implementation of √âmile Cou√©'s psychotherapy. Recovery International is \\"twelve-step friendly.\\" Members of any twelve-step group are encouraged to attend Recovery International meetings in addition to their twelve-step group participation.  Criticism  There are several limitations of self-help groups for mental health, including but not limited to their inability to keep detailed records, lack of formal procedures to follow up with members, absence of formal screening procedures for new members, lack formal leadership training, and likely inability of members to recognize a \\"newcomer\\" presenting with a serious illness requiring immediate treatment. Additionally, there is a lack of professional or legal regulatory constraints determining how such groups can operate, there is a danger that members may disregard the advice of mental health professionals, and there can be an anti-therapeutic suppression of ambivalence and hostility. Researchers have also elaborated specific criticisms regarding self-help groups' formulaic approach, attrition rates, over-generalization, and \\"panacea complex.\\"  Formulaic approach  Researchers have questioned whether formulaic approaches to self-help group therapy, like the Twelve Steps, could stifle creativity or if adherence to them may prevent the group from making useful or necessary changes. Similarly others have criticized self-help group structure as being too rigid.  High attrition rates  There is not a universal appeal of self-help groups; as few as 17% of people invited to attend a self-help group will do so. Of those, only one third will stay for longer than four months. Those who continue are people who value the meetings and the self-help group experience.  Overgeneralization  Since these groups are not specifically diagnosis- related, but rather for anyone seeking mental and emotional health, they may not provide the necessary sense of community to evoke feelings of oneness required for recovery in self-help groups. Referent power is only one factor contributing to group effectiveness. A study of Schizophrenics Anonymous found expert power to be more influential in measurements of perceived group helpfulness.  Panacea complex  There is a risk that self-help group members may come to believe that group participation is a panacea‚Äîthat the group's processes can remedy any problem.  Sexual predation and opportunism  Often membership of non-associated self-help groups is run by volunteers. Monitoring of relationships and standards of conduct are seldom formalized within a group and are done on a self-regulating basis. This can mean undesirable and unethical initiation of sexual and intimate encounters are facilitated in these settings. Predatory and opportunistic behavior in these environments which by association involve divulging volatile mental states, medication changes and life circumstances mean opportunities by those willing to leverage information that is often normally guarded and deeply personal, is a risk more-so than in other social meetup settings or professionally governed bodies.

Listed at , 200 lb., Dyck batted and threw right- handed. He was born in Omaha, Nebraska. Prior to his baseball career Dyck served in the US Navy during World War II.http://www.baseballinwartime.com/those_who_served/those_who_served_atoz.htm Dyck entered the majors in 1951 with the St. Louis Browns, playing for them three years before joining the Cleveland Indians (1954), Baltimore Orioles (1955‚Äì56) and Cincinnati Redlegs (1956). His most productive season came with the 1952 Browns, when he posted career-highs in home runs (15), RBI (64), runs (60), doubles (22) and games played (122), while hitting a .269 batting average. On July 16, 1953, he entered the books records when the Browns tied, by then, a major league mark with three successive home runs during the first inning of an 8‚Äì6 victory over the Yankees. Dyck hit his homer after solo shots belted by Clint Courtney and Dick Kryhoski. Dyck also played every position in his career except for pitcher or catcher. In a six-season career, Dyck was a .246 hitter (242-for-983) with 26 home runs and 114 in 330 games, including 52 doubles, five triples, four stolen bases, and a .344 on-base percentage. Following his majors career, Dyck played during three seasons in the Pacific Coast League with the Indians and Reds affiliated teams, before retiring in 1960 to open a family bowling-alley business in Cheney, Washington.Jim Dyck Society for American Baseball Research Retrieved 2018-12-17.

Launched in 1999 by Gibby Miller, Makeoutclub introduced features and concepts (such as customizable user profiles with photos and interests sections), which later became standard in the social networking sites that followed\\". About The MVP/beta version of the site was launched in August, 1999. This version of the site was hosted privately, the URL given to friends to \\"leak\\" for testing purposes before launch. In the beginning, the site was simple, and featured member pages divided by \\"Boys\\" and \\"Girls\\" with each user able to maintain a \\"Profile Card\\", stream on a cams page, interact on site forums, and contribute news for the homepage. News on the site was typically music oriented, or focused on youth culture, fashion, and internet gossip. Because member pages were rendered chronologically, users took pride in having an \\"early page number\\". Makeoutclub was intended as a platform to bridge the distance between like- minded individuals in the music and youth subculture scenes when the internet was populated with early adopters, stating on the website: \\"...for indierockers, hardcore kids, record collectors, artists, bloggers, and hopeless romantics.\\" Makeoutclub was among the first social networking sites whose members experienced first-hand the stigma associated with meeting others online. Later, Makeoutclub would grow to add fully featured user profile pages, image galleries, message boards, blogs, private mail, private galleries, and \\"crush-lists\\" (an early matchmaking feature). Despite the site's name, Miller insisted in the years of the site's infancy that it was not a dating site, but a place to make friends. This assertion has been challenged many times over. Makeoutclub was featured in Time Magazine, The Face UK, Spin Magazine, Rolling Stone, as well as several television spots across MTV2, G4 Tech TV, Much Music, and more. Makeoutclub was the focal point and inspiration of Andy Greenwald's book about youth and the \\"emo\\" movement: \\"Nothing Feels Good\\", as well as the book \\"This Song Will Save Your Life\\" by Leila Sales. The site was named after the song \\"Make Out Club\\" by the band Unrest. Since its inception, Makeoutclub has continuously been linked to the hipster, emo, and indie subcultures.  History  *(1999) Beta: Beta access was invite-only during testing in the months ahead of launch. *(2000) 1.0: Version 1.0 was the \\"release\\" version of MOC. *(2001) 2.0: Version 2.0 was a bug-fixing and security upgrade, which offered additional features like HTML on profiles and colored usernames. *(2004) 3.0: Version 3.0 added a new design, additional bug fixes, and security upgrades. *(2007) 4.0: Version 4.0 was an entirely new platform, and offered users their own individual profile pages with comments, blogs, and the ability to add and display friends. Users could now add multiple images to a gallery, send private messages to one another, and block other users. This version also introduced multiple forums. *(2008) 5.0: Version 5.0 improved upon 4.0 adding private galleries, the ability to \\"wink\\" other users, post \\"shoutouts\\", create \\"crush lists\\" (secret friends lists that reveal the crush connection if two users \\"crush one another), and search for users in your area (along with user vicinity recommendation). *(2012) 6.0: Version 6.0 went live the evening of April 19, 2012, bringing back required applications for approval (like the original platform did), and became entirely private, requiring a login to read the forums or to browse profiles. *(2014) 7.0: Version 7.0 went live on Saturday, February 22, 2014 with a responsive design and feature set, once again making the site publicly accessible, and restoring archives of old posts and site history as far back as 2002. *(2017) Closure: Makeoutclub ceased operations on January 1, 2017.

Nicknamed \\"Mr. Radio Baseball\\", Helfer called the play-by- play of seven World Series, ten All-Star Games, and regular season broadcasts for several teams (among them the New York Yankees, Brooklyn Dodgers and Oakland Athletics) and the Mutual network. He also broadcast the Army‚ÄìNavy Game during the 1940s and '50s, and several Rose Bowl games. Early life and career Helfer was born in Elrama, Pennsylvania. He played football and basketball at Washington & Jefferson College, and took his first job as a sports reporter for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after graduation, also calling the football games of the Pittsburgh Pirates (as they were then called) and Pittsburgh Panthers for radio station WWSW. He started broadcasting recreations of Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games in 1933. He joined Red Barber as the regular broadcast team of the Cincinnati Reds in 1935. He left Cincinnati to join CBS in 1937, working a few baseball games and a lot of football games. Helfer was reunited with Barber (who often addressed him on- air as \\"Brother Al\\") on the Brooklyn Dodgers broadcasts in 1939. They worked together until 1941, when Helfer joined the U.S. Navy during World War II. When he returned the Dodgers job was no longer available, so Helfer started doing \\"Game of the Day\\" broadcasts for Mutual. He was paired with Dizzy Dean on the network's broadcasts in the early 1950s, though the two men often argued and never got along. He did eventually rejoin the Dodgers for their last years in Brooklyn, calling their final home game and introducing the players to the crowd for the final time. In 1958 Helfer called Philadelphia Phillies games which were broadcast to the New York market by WOR-TV, helping to fill the void of National League baseball left in the city by the departure of the Dodgers and Giants. He worked a number of teams after that, including the Houston Colt .45s (1962), Denver Broncos (1962‚Äì63), and Oakland Athletics (1968‚Äì69). Awards and honors On December 12, 2018 it was announced Helfer had been awarded the Ford C. Frick Award for Excellence in Baseball Broadcasting from the Baseball Hall of Fame. Personal life His second wife was vaudeville performer Ramona; they married on 14 June 1944, and stayed together until her death in December 1972. The following June, he married Sacramento resident Margaret Grabbe, to whom he remained married until his death. He died, aged 63, in Sacramento, California.

The SVT is a stand-alone amplifier or \\"head\\" as opposed to a \\"combo\\" unit comprising amp and speaker(s) in one cabinet, and was capable of 300 watts output at a time when most amplifiers could not exceed 100 watts output, making the SVT an important amp for bands playing music festivals and other large venues. The SVT has been through many design changes over the years but is still in production today. While the SVT could be used with any 300 watt, 2- or 4-ohm cabinet combination, Ampeg recommended that it be used with a pair of sealed 8x10\\" speaker enclosures because one cabinet could not handle the power of the SVT. It wasn't until 1980 that the speakers in the enclosures were updated to a power handling rating of 350 watts, allowing a player to use an SVT head with only one cabinet! SVT originally stood for Super Vacuum Tube, but Ampeg has since revised the meaning of the acronym to Super Valve Technology, with the word \\"valve\\" referring to the vacuum tubes (called \\"valves\\" in Britain and some other regions) used in the amp. History Following Unimusic's acquisition of Ampeg in 1967, the new company management was actively pursuing the rock market, opening offices in Chicago, Nashville, and Hollywood, and developing products designed to address the needs of rock musicians. When The Rolling Stones began rehearsing for their 1969 U.S. Tour in Hollywood, a power conversion failure blew up all of their UK Fender amplifiers. Their road manager, Ian Stewart contacted Rich Mandella at the Ampeg office in Hollywood, and Rich arranged for the band to use five prototype high-output amplifier heads of a new model being developed by Bill Hughes and Roger Cox. These new amps employed a 14-tube design to generate 300 watts of power in an era when most tube amps generated less than 100. The Rolling Stones took these prototype Ampeg amps on tour along with Rich Mandella, playing all guitars and basses through them for the entire tour. After the tour, Ampeg put the SVT into production, introducing it at the NAMM Show in 1969. Types There are three types of original SVT amps. The first are the \\"blue line\\" SVTs, so named after the blue screen printing that surrounds the tone controls. Early 1969-70 \\"blue lines\\" used 6146B beam power vacuum tubes in the output stage, which proved unstable and was switched to the more robust, reliable and commonly- used 6550 tube around mid-1970. The second version of a vintage SVT is what is called the \\"black line\\" SVT, earning its name from the black (rather than blue) faceplate screen printing. Like the later-revision \\"blue lines\\" models, the \\"black line\\" SVTs utilize 6550 power vacuum tubes instead of 6146Bs. Later 1970s models have the same features as the \\"black line\\" SVTs, except the lines around the tone controls have rounded corners and curve into the tone controls. Additionally, these models included 3-prong power cables, and did not include a polarity switch. Ampeg SVT VR \\"Vintage Reissue\\" (blue line) In the early 1980s, Ampeg was bought by Music Technologies, Inc. (MTI), which contracted to have SVTs manufactured in Japan. While MTI-era SVTs are mostly identical to the previous versions, they did have differences. Cosmetically, MTI SVTs have black faceplates with white lettering, black grill cloth, \\"elephant hide\\" or rougher textured tolex, and rack case-style spring-loaded handles, updated from the previous (and painful) rubber-covered metal strap handles. These SVTs also include a back panel selector toggle for 2 or 4 ohm speaker impedance loads and a longer and thicker gauge 3-prong power cable. Additionally, some components, such as the transformers, on MTI-era SVTs are of Japanese origin as opposed to the original SVT transformers made by Chicago-based ETC.. In 1986, St. Louis Music acquired the rights to the Ampeg name and took possession of all remaining MTI inventory, which contained enough original components to build 500 amps. These 1987 Limited Edition SVTs were built in the U.S. by SLM's own Skunk Works crew, and each included an engraved panel indicating the unit's number within the production of 500 total units. In 1990, Ampeg introduced the SVT-II and SVT-II Pro, and in 1994, introduced the SVT-CL (Classic). In 2005, LOUD Technologies (now LOUD Audio, LLC) acquired St. Louis Music, including Ampeg. Under LOUD's management, production of Ampeg and versions of SVTs and cabinets was moved to Asia. In 2010, Ampeg introduced the Heritage Series line, manufactured in LOUD Technologies' facility in Woodinville, Washington, including the Heritage SVT- CL head and SVT-810E and SVT-410HLF cabinets. The updated head featured JJ- branded preamp and driver tubes and \\"Winged C\\" 6550 power amp tubes, all tested and matched by Ruby Tubes in California, along with a thicker 1.6mm two-layer printed circuit board with through-hole plating and increased copper weight. In May, 2018, Yamaha Guitar Group acquired Ampeg from LOUD Audio. Ampeg continues to manufacture and sell Heritage Series and SVT Pro Series models of SVT. Tubes and modifications The SVT amps with 6146B tubes tend to put out a bit more power as well as have a more pronounced grind in low mids, as opposed to the more round, deeper bass sound provided by SVTs with 6550A tubes. This sound characteristic is mostly due to 6146 being much lower in transconductance and less sensitive to drive signal, requiring a higher level from the Pre-amp, which can create more \\"harmonic growl.\\" The issues with the earliest version of the SVT were in the early design of the driver circuit, not the 6146B tube which is a stable and reliable tube. The earliest SVT driver circuit's design would on occasion result in blown 6146B tubes. Because the front end 12BH7 voltage amplifier is fed from the 430 V node, during loud transients and overloads this will produce an AC signal that far exceeds the 12BH7 follower that has 220 V on the plates. So when the follower grid is driven well over its own plate voltage, it saturates on the positive half of the signal and thus takes over the BIAS voltage, forcing it very positive. The time for this voltage to come back to normal is based on the time constant of the 150 kŒ© mixer resistors and the coupling cap - but by this time it is too late, the bias is pushed too far into the positive and the current gets pushed through the 6146, resulting in blown tubes. Some users have an electronics technician re-wire the 12BH7 feed the same as on the later 6550 heads. By adding a 1K and filter cap feeding from the 220 V screen supply to the front voltage amp of the 12BH7, a 6146B tube runs reliably with far fewer issues. However, conversion of 6146B to 6550 tubes also has a dramatic impact on the output power. The amp will produce roughly 225 watts, due to the screen voltage being too low. As such, the power transformer of a 6146B SVT will be about 220 V DC on the screen supply at idle instead of the typical 350 V idle screen voltage normally seen on 6550 amps. One solution is wire the screens in a voltage double arrangement, which will end up at roughly 400 V screen voltage at idle. This will make for a very powerful 400 W SVT. Conversion from a 6550 tube to 6146B tube is a bit trickier, as the 6146B will not tolerate anything over 250 V on the screens or else it will arc over. Some amp technicians prefer to disassemble to PT and tap the windings from the side of the bobbin to create a lower voltage taps. Other methods are to use voltage regulation. The SVT's pre-amp is notorious for ground loop hum. Re-wiring and separating the audio ground shield from the power return ground lead in the MOLEX connector is one solution. The pre-amp can sound quicker if the circuit is rebuilt with Hi-End Audio Grade coupling caps. Diodes were later used to by-pass the 22ohm screen resistors. In the event of a tube short failure or simply a transient overload condition the diode will conduct once the current in the 22ohm screen resistor reaches 30mA and beyond, preventing further burning of the PCBA. The diode will clamp the current in the 22ohm screen resistor to 30mA, so preferably the plate resistor will blow, since the plate resistor is acting as a \\"fuse\\". Plate resistors should be kept off the circuit board by approx 1/2\\" min to prevent PCBA burning. The diode is taking on the current surge to protect the 22 Œ© resistor, however the peak over current in the diode can only sustain for a short duration. The 6550A version usually idles with roughly 700 V DC on the plate and 350 V DC on the Screens (though during full clean sine wave 300 W power output, operating voltages will dip to roughly 650 V DC on the Plate and 325 V on the Screens). The output transformer plate load is 1.6 K at 4 Œ© tap and 1.75 K at the 2 Œ© tap.

Radal Siete Tazas National Park () is a national park located in Curic√≥ Province, Maule Region, Chile. It lies in a pre-Andean area close to Descabezado Grande volcano. History This protected area was reclassified as a national park in 2008. After the February 27, 2010 earthquake one of the park's main attraction, the Seven Cups, completely dried up. It is believed a rock fissure allowed the water to empty into an aquifer. Geography The park's most popular feature is the area known as Siete Tazas (Seven Cups), which consists of seven consecutive natural pools with their respective waterfalls along Claro River. These waterfalls range from 1 to 10.5 metres. There are also two high waterfalls called El Velo de Novia (The Bridal Veil) and La Leona (The Lioness), with single vertical drops of 40 and 20 metres respectively. Many kayakers paddle the smaller falls ranging from 1 to 10.5 metres (3‚Äì32 feet). Once kayakers enter the steep canyon the only way out is down. Many tourists congregate on platforms surrounding the canyon to watch the kayakers as they navigate the waterfalls. At the end of the run kayakers must make a quick move to shore in order to avoid the 40 meter waterfall. This is the end of the canyon where kayakers then hike out. The park's elevations range from to . Biology The park protects tree species mainly of the genus Nothofagus, including the threatened Nothofagus glauca and Nothofagus leonii, as well as Nothofagus macrocarpa, Nothofagus dombeyi, Nothofagus antarctica and Nothofagus alpina. Also it is possible to find vulnerable and rare species, as are Austrocedrus chilensis and Maytenus chubutensis. The park is home to an endangered subspecies of Cyanoliseus patagonus known locally as Tricahue.

He has been termed the \\"father of psychedelic art in Australia\\". In the late 1960s he was deemed to be \\"Australia's leading practitioner of abstract eroticism.\\" He was married to Riri Treweeke and has five children, including his sons Luke(jazz virtuoso pianist), born in 1967, whose mother is the Australian Artist Wendy Paramor, Swift, born 1979, a musician, a fellow painter, and a label owner (http://www.passengerofshit.com/bio.html), and Julian and Yiani, also musicians, all of which Vern has collaborated with. One of Vernone Treweeke's murals at Katoomba railway station, Blue Mountains Line His work is held in various Australian and international collections, including the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria. Early life Treweeke grew up in Sydney, Australia. He attended boarding school at Scots School in Bathurst where he became a close friend of Brett Whiteley. From 1957 to 1959 he studied painting, drawing and sculpture at the Australian National Art School under John Passmore and Lyndon Dadswell. In 1961 he travelled to London via India and France. Whilst in London in 1962 he was included in the prestigious \\"Young Commonwealth Artists\\" exhibition that toured Germany, France and England. While in London he associated with many expatriate Australian artists including Michael Johnson, Tony McGillick and Wendy Paramor, and the English artists, David Hockney and Patrick Caulfield. Career In 1966 Treweeke returned to Sydney via New York and San Francisco. In the late 1960s Treweeke regularly showed his work at Central Street Gallery in Sydney. His work of this time can be seen as developing a prototype for methods of exhibition practice that have subsequently become known as installation, multi-media and electronic art. A typical Treweeke exhibition during the Central Street years included silkscreen images on modular canvas panels coated in fluorescent paint, a sound component and then the whole space would be saturated in ultraviolet neon light. By 1970 Treweeke had abandoned his increasingly high-profile career as an artist. His lifelong interest in beat culture; exotic religions and alternative lifestyles eventually led him to the town of Nimbin. In 1973 Treweeke was instrumental in organizing the Aquarius Festival. Until his death in 2015, he lived in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, where he painted murals on several of the stations on the Blue Mountains railway line, which feature elements of local folklore. In 2003 a major exhibition of his work, the first in 30 years, was exhibited at Penrith Regional Gallery in Western Sydney. In June 2010, an exhibition of his work was exhibited at CarriageWorks, centre for contemporary arts and culture, in Eveleigh, Sydney. Death Treweeke died 19 March 2015, much loved by his family and seven grandchildren.

Minton is a highly dramatic baritone who tends to specialize in literary texts: he has sung lyrics by William Blake with Mike Westbrook's group, Daniil Kharms and Joseph Brodsky with Simon Nabatov, and extracts from James Joyce's Finnegans Wake with his own ensemble. He sings on a Jimi Hendrix tribute album, belting out the lyrics in over-the-top fashion. Between 1987 and 1993 Minton toured Europe, North America, and Russia with Lindsay Cooper's Oh Moscow ensemble. He is perhaps best known, however, for his completely free-form work, which involves \\"extended techniques\\" that can be as unsettling as they can be mesmerising. His vocals often include the sounds of retching, burping, screaming, and gasping, as well as childlike muttering, whining, crying and humming; he also has an ability to distort his vocal cords to produce two notes at once.

Location  Maphou is located in the Tomching Chingsang Hills range and is situated on the bank of the Thoubal River. It is located from the city of Imphal. It is surrounded by villages belonging to the Tangkhul tribe.  History  Maphou was established in 1946, before the independence of India, by Lenghou Lupho, who previously lived in the nearby village of Singkap. In 1945 Lenghou Lupho converted to Christianity and was forced to move. The present village chief is Haokhomang Lupho( Ex-Chairman, Thoubal Area Kuki Inpi, the great grandson of Lenghou Lupho.  Church movement  As the village was established after the Lenghou family converted to Christianity, the Christian church was one of the first buildings in the village. The first church leader was Ngamkholhun Lupho. In the 1980s a second church was built. The two congregations were Newlife and Kuki Baptist Convention (KBC). After 1990 a single church was formed under the banner of the Maphou Local Baptist Church. The golden jubilee of the church was in 1996 but the celebration was not held until 2000, due to the ethnic clashes that were occurring at that time. The theme of the jubilee celebration was a quotation from Mathew 16:18: \\"And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.\\"  Ethnic origin of the villagers  The villagers belong to the Milhiem (also known as Milhem and Miriem) group of the Kuki ethnic group. According to the unpublished booklet Misao Inkon, Pu Shinghil. Pa Minluto, their progenitor, Hangmi, is the son of Vumchom. The terms Milhiem, Mirem, Meriem, Miria and Milhem are synonymous with Hangmi.Ethnic_Races_Manipur.Understanding_the_Lupho_Lupheng_Misao, Their language is a member of the Kukish branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family, with whom they share history, culture and traditions. Recently, some concerns were raised regarding the ability for citizens of Maphou to preserve their identity and culture if intertribal marriages are allowed with the neighbouring Tangkhul tribe villages and Meitei community villages. Effects of ethnic clashes  The Kuki‚ÄìNaga ethnic clash of 1990s had a great impact on the village, with damage to property, and some villagers losing their lives. Due to these ethnic clashes there has been some migration of villagers to safer places. Ngamjapoa Lupho (Ex-Chairman Thoubal Area kuki Inpi, Ex president Kuki Baptist Convention) was killed in the ethnic violence by militant members of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN IM) in 1998. He was a prominent chief who was the seventh son of the founder of the village. He was killed by an ambush while on his way to Imphal in his personal jeep along with six other villagers.  Government and other institutions  Maphou Village Authority is the group in charge of local government. The village chief is the chairman of the village authority. Maphou Local Baptist church is active in town. Maphou Youth Development Organisation (MYDO) and the Nisha Band (a women's organisation) help improve village life. There is a primary health centre (Maphou PHC),. The Maphou UJB school is run in a partnership between the village authority and the Government. The village is home to the Angawadi Centre.

The village of Goldington has now been incorporated into the town of Bedford, and the castle is now officially is located in Newnham ward. The mound is located on the north side of the River Ouse, three miles east of Bedford Castle and a mile west of Renhold Castle Details Controversy exists over the original purpose of the earthwork, particularly whether it was actually part of a castle site. Conventional wisdom states Risinghoe Castle was a timber Motte-and-bailey castle built sometime after the Norman Invasion of 1066. It is referred to as having been the property of Hugh de Beauchamp, the chief landowner in Goldington in 1086. The castle is mentioned as already being old by the end of the 12th century. It was probably obtained by Warden Abbey with the grange of Risinghoe and Puttenhoe Manor, with which it was conferred on Sir John Gostwick at the Dissolution (1538‚Äì1541), afterwards passing, with the rest of their property in Goldington, to John Russell, Duke of Bedford. There is no surviving physical evidence of a bailey, nor other elements of a castle, although this may be due to extensive clay extraction on the site in Victorian times. A number of authors have stated that the mound was excavated in 1943, however no primary sources for the excavation appear to exist, and there is no mention of it in the report of the 1943 annual meeting of the Bedfordshire Natural History and Archaeological Society. An alternative version, stated by local residents, is that the mound was penetrated for the construction of an air raid shelter in 1940 and nothing was found. If the second version of events is correct, then no professional excavation has ever taken place. Beauchamp Wadmore, in his 1920 book The Earthworks of Bedfordshire, casts further doubts on the status as a castle site. Wadmore's researches point to the mound being erected to commemorate a 9th-century victory over the Danes associated with nearby Gannock Castle. Wadmore also states that, prior to the damage of the site for clay extraction, a second smaller mound existed. However, an early Ordnance Survey map names it as a castle site. Risinghoe Castle is located on private property belonging to a local company and is not open to the public. However, the site can be viewed from a distance from the nearby road.

Plot summary The story takes the form of a first-person narrative by the protagonist, time-traveling hunter Reginald Rivers, told to Mr. Seligman, a prospective client of his time safari business; Seligman's contributions to the conversation are omitted, and must be inferred from those of Rivers. Rivers informs the client he is not big enough to hunt the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period, illustrating his point with an extended anecdote from a previous expedition, which forms the main portion of the tale. On the occasion in question, Rivers and his partner Chandra Aiyar conduct two other clients to the past. One of them, Courtney James (based on Jack Parsons), is a vain, arrogant and spoiled playboy; the other, August Holtzinger, is a small, timid man recently come into wealth (time safaris are not cheap). Before the journey, they test-fire some guns on the firing range to settle on weapons for each of them. Holtzinger's small size makes him incapable of effectively handling a heavy-caliber weapon (the recoil knocks him over) and, against his better judgment, Rivers lets Holtzinger travel on the safari with a lighter- caliber weapon. James proves unmanageable, shooting at every creature in sight and spoiling Holtzinger's shots. Ultimately James' foolishness gets him in real trouble, when he inadvertently empties his rifle over a slumbering Tyrannosaur, which consequently wakes and goes for him and Aiyar. James panics and tries to flee, but runs into Aiyar, knocking them both down. Holtzinger tries to save them by shooting the dinosaur, but his gun is not powerful enough to kill it, and his act only attracts it toward the shooter. Despite the best efforts of Rivers and Aiyar to save Holtzinger, the Tyrannosaur snaps him up and makes off with his body. After a fruitless track for the Tyrannosaur so that Holtzinger's body could be recovered, a furious quarrel with James ensues, he and the guides each blaming the other for their companion's death, leading to a fist-fight between James and Rivers in which James is defeated. James tries to shoot Rivers, but is knocked out by Aiyar; afterwards he swears revenge. Later, after the expedition has returned to the present, James convinces Professor Prochaska, the inventor of the time chamber, to send him back to the Cretaceous again‚Äîbut at a point just prior to the emergence of the safari's earlier visit. His plan is to shoot Rivers and Aiyar the moment they originally came out of the time machine. Since that obviously had not happened, however, the space-time continuum avoids the paradox by spontaneously snapping James back to the present, the forces involved instantly killing him. Concluding his tale, Rivers makes his point with Seligman by emphasizing Holtzinger's fate. Revision and continuations De Camp revised the story slightly for its inclusion in Rivers of Time to update obsolete paleontological terms and dated references. In one instance the result was unfortunate; in the original version of the story, Rivers estimates Seligman's weight in both pounds and stone;De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"A Gun for Dinosaur,\\" in Galaxy Science Fiction, v. 11, no. 5, March 1956, p. 7: \\"How much d'you weigh? A hundred and thirty? Let's see, that's under ten stone, which is my lower limit.\\" in the revised version both measures are rendered as kilograms, resulting in Rivers appearing to make the same calculation twice.De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"A Gun for Dinosaur,\\" in Rivers of Time (New York : Baen, 1993, p. 1: \\"How much d'you weigh? Fifty-four kilos? Let's see‚Äîthat's under sixty kilos, which is my lower limit.\\" Many years after writing the story, de Camp penned eight more tales of its protagonist, time- traveling hunter Reginald Rivers; all nine stories were then collected as Rivers of Time (1993). A tenth tale of Rivers, \\"Gun, Not for Dinosaur\\", authored by Chris Bunch, later appeared in Harry Turtledove's 2005 tribute anthology honoring L. Sprague de Camp, The Enchanter Completed. Reception The story was a nominee for the 1956 Hugo Award for Best Novelette. P. Schuyler Miller singles out the story as \\"one of the classic time-travel stories invading the years of the dinosaurs.\\" S. E. Cotts calls it \\"one of my favorites,\\" noting that \\"[i]ts subject, about a safari into the past, has been successfully tackled by other writers, but this version has solid merit.\\"Cotts, S. E. \\"The Spectroscope\\" in Amazing Stories, v. 37, no. 9, September 1963, p. 125. Sam Moskowitz, who felt de Camp's ... plots less incisive\\" during this period, cited this story as an \\"outstanding exception\\" discussing \\"with an air of quiet authority the problem of what type of gun and what methodology were best suited to shooting dinosaurs.\\"Moskowitz, Sam. \\"L. Sprague de Camp\\" in Seekers of Tomorrow, 1967, p. 168. Don D'Ammassa calls it \\"an undeniably classic story of the dangers of time travel.\\" Harry Turtledove deems the piece a \\"classic, ... at the same time a fine character study, a meditation on time-travel paradoxes (here treated as something the continuum seeks to avoid rather than a likely result of voyaging into the past), and a splendid re-creation of a vanished world. De Camp makes the reader feel the heat and humidity of the world to which Reginald Rivers and his band of hunters are transported--and feel the bites from insects with mouthparts evolved to pierce dinosaur hide. He does a masterful job of discussing the difficulties inherent in hunting extinct behemoths with weapons small enough for one man to handle. When troubles arise, they do so as a natural consequence of the characters' personalities, and are more moving and convincing because of that.\\" He feels the story \\"has also aged very well, despite the vast increase in paleontological knowledge in the past half- century.\\" Influence and literary responses *Mark B. Goodwin claims de Camp's story \\"popularized the idea that pachycephalosaurs used their domed skulls as a kind of battering ram,\\" a notion first suggested as \\"a wild idea\\" by vertebrate paleontologist Edwin H. Colbert in 1955.Goodwin, Mark B. \\"Take a Closer Look.\\" In Dig v. 12, no. 6, July/Aug. 2010, pp. 8-12. (The pachycephalosaur episode appears on pages 14‚Äì15 of the story as published in Rivers of Time.) *David Drake in his 1981 story \\"Time Safari\\", uses a very similar set of characters and events. In \\"Time Safari\\", the guide character dismisses as a misconception a significant point (to both stories) about the need for a sufficiently large gun to kill a dinosaur, thus contradicting the earlier story. *Author Leonard Richardson mentions his disappointment that this story \\"is not about a dinosaur who buys a gun\\" as one of his influences in writing his own 2009 short story, \\"Let Us Now Praise Awesome Dinosaurs.\\"Leonard Richardson. \\"On The Origin Of Awesome Dinosaurs.\\" News You Can Bruise, weblog post dated Tue Jul 14 2009 16:48.

I-75 enters the Cumberland Plateau region from Tennessee, then descends into the Bluegrass region through the Pottsville Escarpment before crossing the Ohio River into Ohio. I-75 follows along the U.S. Route 25 corridor for the entire length of Kentucky. Route description Interstate 75 runs roughly parallel to U.S. Route 25 for its entire length in Kentucky. The freeway enters Kentucky south of Williamsburg in the Cumberland Plateau, bypassing Corbin and London before descending into the Bluegrass region near Berea through the Pottsville Escarpment. The highway continues north through Richmond en route to Lexington. It meets and then becomes briefly concurrent with Interstate 64 along the north and east sides of Lexington, before leaving the Lexington area northerly and bypassing Georgetown en route to Cincinnati, Ohio. South of Florence, the route becomes concurrent with Interstate 71, and the two routes remain concurrent through to Cincinnati. On the north side of Florence, Interstate 75 intersects with the only auxiliary route it has in the state, Interstate 275, a beltway bypass of the greater Cincinnati area. The highway then enters Covington, and crosses the Ohio River via the Brent Spence Bridge into Cincinnati and the state of Ohio. History The stretch through Covington originally included hills and curves steeper than those recommended for Interstate Highway standards. As a result, the northbound descent into Cincinnati, known as Cut-in-the-Hill, was nicknamed \\"Death Hill\\". It is a steep descent into the valley of the Ohio River between Kyles Lane and the Brent Spence Bridge leading into downtown Cincinnati. The hill is known for its high number of automobile accidents. In 2006 the Cut-in-the-Hill averaged over seven times more accidents when compared to similar roadways in Kentucky. At the Cut-in-the-Hill the northbound road takes a sharp left turn into a steep grade down to the Ohio River--about in . Accidents are usually attributed to a combination of speeding, curvy lanes, poor weather, longer stopping times for trucks traveling downhill, and traffic congestion. The area earned the sobriquet \\"Death Hill\\" shortly after Interstate 75 opened in 1962. By 1968 a total of 23 people died in crashes on the hill so a concrete wall was installed to separate northbound and southbound traffic. The wall helped reduce fatal crashes but accidents continued, and in 1977 the hill averaged 583 automobile accidents per year. In 1986 a tractor-trailer lost control, leading to an accident that caused a Northern Kentucky University student to burn to death in his car. As a result, Governor Martha Layne Collins banned most northbound tractor-trailer traffic from the hill. From 1989 until 1994 $50-million in reconstruction was spent to straighten the hill's S-curve and add a fourth lane for southbound traffic, and in 1995 the truck ban was lifted. Also as part of the reconstruction, ramps were added at Pike Street to give complete access, while an interchange with Jefferson and Euclid Avenues was obliterated. In 2006 the hill and the Brent Spence Bridge saw 151 crashes in the northbound direction and 121 crashes in the southbound direction, totaling 272 in all. To help reduce the number of accidents a flashing \\"Steep Grade\\" sign was installed, and a Kentucky State Police trooper was assigned to patrol just the Cut-in-the-Hill. Additionally, eight radar speed signs were installed in 2007 to remind motorists to drive a safer speed. The Cut-in-the-Hill was originally designed to carry up to 80,000 vehicles per day, but in 2006 it carried 155,000 daily. Kentucky officials are reportedly working to raise more than $2 billion to replace the section of highway, but as of 2012 no construction is planned.

He also was once a vowed member of the Congregation of the Mission due to his devotion to Saint Vincent de Paul but left it after experiencing a sudden vocational crisis. Pope John Paul II canonized the late priest as a saint in 2000 after he had beatified him in Mexico in 1992. Life Jos√© Maria de Yermo y Parres was born on 10 November 1851 to Manuel de Yermo y Sovi√±as and Mar√≠a Josefa Parres (d. 30 December 1851); the Yermos came from a line of nobles in Spain before going to Mexico. The death of his mother saw his father return to the capital and ask his sister Carmen to take care of him. The child spent his time under the care of his paternal aunt and grandmother who instilled religious values in him. In 1864 he received from Maximilian I of Mexico a medal of honor for his distinctions as a student. He had received his education from private teachers before going to private schools. It was in 1863 that he met and forged a lifelong friendship with the distinguished poet Juan de Dios Peza. In 1867 he left home in order to enter the Congregation of the Mission and he made his vows into the order in Toluca on 10 November 1868. His superiors sent him to the order's motherhouse in Paris for studies and he later returned in 1870 around the time he experienced a sudden vocational crisis. He departed the order around this time due to this crisis and returned home. But his friend Father Miguel Arizmendi continued to guide him and advised him to continue his studies for the priesthood while his uncle Jos√© Maria Diez de Sollano y D√°valos approved the decision for him to do so. Nevertheless, he managed to discern his path and returned to his wish of becoming a priest despite not re-entering the Vincentians. He was ordained to the priesthood on 24 August 1879. After his ordination the new diocesan bishop (Sollano's successor) assigned him to the two small churches of El Calvario and Santo Ni√±o despite his protests against this viewing this as both unjust and as a humiliation of his record of good work where he was prior to this; he however managed to discern the will of God and departed for his new assignment in obedience to Him. On one occasion he happened to see a group of pigs eat the remains of two abandoned newborns and this sickening sight made him feel as if he should help those who were abandoned. The priest opened \\"The Shelter of the Sacred Heart\\" on 13 December 1885 to cater to the needs of the poor in a move that laid the foundation for beginning a new religious order dedicated to serving the poor and at the same time evolved that into the order he titled the Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Poor at the summit of El Calvario. He founded several hospitals and orphanages as well as shelters for the abused and he also collaborated with the Tarahumara people towards the end of his life. He often said: \\"Let us speak about saints to forge saints\\". He died in the morning of 20 September 1904 in Puebla de los Angeles after asking the nuns to sing the Ave Maria Stella; he was buried there at the motherhouse of the order. His order now operates in the places such as the United States of America and Nicaragua amongst others. Sainthood The sainthood process commenced in Puebla de Los Angeles in an informative process that was inaugurated in the diocese on 6 May 1949 though soon remained inactive for a few decades before a decree was issued allowing the informative process to resume on 13 September 1976; the informative process finally concluded its work on 3 April 1978. The formal start to the cause came on 31 July 1981 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled the late priest as a Servant of God. The cognitional process was later opened on 1 July 1983 and closed on 8 August 1983 before both processes received validation from the C.C.S. on 7 June 1985 before the C.C.S. received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1988. Theologians granted approval to the cause on 19 May 1989 as did the C.C.S. on 4 July 1989 which allowed for Pope John Paul II to confirm that the late priest had lived a life of heroic virtue on 7 September 1989 in a move that accorded upon him the title of Venerable. The process for the miracle leading to beatification spanned from July to August 1981 and was validated later on 20 October 1989 before a medical board approved it on 28 February 1990; theologians followed suit on 23 March 1990 as did the C.C.S. on 24 April 1990. The pope approved it on 26 April 1990 and later beatified the priest while on a visit to Mexico City on 22 November 1992. The process for the miracle leading to canonization spanned for a brief period of time in May 1998 before receiving validation on 26 June 1998. A medical board approved the miracle on 19 November 1998 while theologians did so too on 7 May 1999 as did the C.C.S. on 5 October 1999. The pope issued the final approval needed on 20 December 1999 and then canonized the late priest on 21 May 2000 in Saint Peter's Square.

He was consecrated bishop after 18 April 1161, at Canterbury Cathedral by Walter, the Bishop of Rochester.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 64 Theobald had wished to consecrate Bartholomew before Theobald died, but could not because the king was abroad in Normandy and the bishop-elect had to swear fealty to the king before he could be consecrated.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 71 After his consecration, Bartholomew gave the archdeaconry of Exeter to the disappointed royal candidate. Time as bishop During the dispute between King Henry and Thomas Becket, Bartholomew refused to cooperate with either side, which caused Becket to scold him as a bad friend.Warren Henry II p. 550 At the start of the dispute, Bartholomew was sent with a royal deputation to Sens to ask the pope to send papal legates to England to settle the quarrel. Thereafter, he avoided being drawn into the controversy, until 1170. When Roger of York crowned Henry the Young King in 1170, Bartholomew was said to be present.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 206‚Äì207 In September 1170, Pope Alexander III suspended Bartholomew from office for attending the coronation, along with a number of other bishops.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 216 Shortly after a settlement of the dispute was reached in 1172, Henry wrote to Bartholomew saying that \\"I shall abolish all new customs introduced in my reign against the churches of my land (which I consider to be few or none)\\",Quoted in Barber Henry Plantagenet p. 163 which signaled Henry's intentions of mostly ignoring the settlement.Barber Henry Plantagenet p. 163 Bartholomew was restored to his office before 21 December 1171, when he helped restore Canterbury Cathedral to use for religious ceremonies. Early in his episcopate, Bartholomew attended Alexander III's council at Tours in 1163, along with a number of other English bishops. Bartholomew often acted as a judge-delegate for the papacy in cases that had been appealed to Rome.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 90 Alexander described Bartholomew, in company with Richard of Dover, another leading papal judge, as the \\"twin lights illuminating the English Church\\".Quoted in Duggan \\"From the Conquest to the Death of John\\" English Church and the Papacy p. 113 In his diocese, Bartholomew is known to have visited the parishes, conducting a visitation to inquire into the management or mismanagement of church affairs.Cheney From Becket to Langton p. 167 Death and legacy Bartholomew died on 15 December 1184.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 246 He was buried in Exeter Cathedral. A relief in Exeter has been identified as possibly Bartholomew's effigy for his tomb.Bartlett England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings p. 599 A contemporary writer, Gerald of Wales, said that Bartholomew was better educated in Roman law than in canon law. The historian Austin Lane Poole said of him that he \\"kept out as much as possible out of secular politics, and used [his] learning and practical abilities whole- heartedly for the welfare of the church.\\"Poole Domesday Book to Magna Carta p. 222 During his bishopric, he advanced the career of Baldwin of Forde, as it was Bartholomew who made Baldwin archdeacon.Knowles Monastic Order p. 317 He had two nephews, Jordan and Harold, who were part of his household while he was at Exeter. At some point in his career, he wrote a Penitentiale, or penitential, which true to his canon lawyer training, quotes canon law extensively.Brooke English Church and the Papacy pp. 111‚Äì112 This was based on the works of Ivo of Chartres, Burchard of Worms, Gratian, and Peter Lombard, among other authors. Besides his penitential, Bartholomew also wrote works on the doctrines of free will and predestination, entitled either De libero arbitrio or De fatalitate et fato, a collection of over a hundred sermons, and a work against Jews, entitled Dialogus contra Judaeos. So far, only the penitential has been printed.

Released annually from 2005 through 2008, the four books chart the later teen years of Isabella \\"Bella\\" Swan, a girl who moves to Forks, Washington, from Arizona and falls in love with a 104-year-old vampire named Edward Cullen. The series is told primarily from Bella's point of view, with the epilogue of Eclipse and Part II of Breaking Dawn being told from the viewpoint of character Jacob Black, a werewolf. The novel Midnight Sun is a retelling of the first book, Twilight, from Edward Cullen's point of view. The novella The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, which tells the story of a newborn vampire who appeared in Eclipse, was published on June 5, 2010, as a hardcover book and on June 7 as a free online ebook. The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide, a definitive encyclopedic reference with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was released in bookstores on April 12, 2011. Since the release of the first novel, Twilight, in 2005, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial success around the world. The series is most popular among young adults; the four books have won multiple awards, most notably the 2008 British Book Award for \\"Children's Book of the Year\\" for Breaking Dawn, while the series as a whole won the 2009 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Book. In November 2011, the series had sold over 120 million copies worldwide with translations into at least 38 different languages around the globe.Twilight Exposed! The Inside Story of a Billion Dollar Franchise The four Twilight books have consecutively set records as the biggest-selling novels of 2008 on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list and have spent over 235 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Series Books. The books have been adapted into The Twilight Saga series of motion pictures by Summit Entertainment. The film adaptations of the first three books were released in 2008, 2009, and 2010 respectively. The fourth book is adapted into two full- length films‚Äîthe first film being released in November 2011, and the second film in November 2012. Plot overview Twilight Bella Swan moves from Phoenix, Arizona to live with her father in Forks, Washington to allow her mother to travel with her new husband, a minor league baseball player. After moving to Forks, Bella finds herself involuntarily drawn to a mysterious, handsome boy, Edward Cullen and eventually learns that he is a member of a vampire family which drinks animal blood rather than human blood. Edward and Bella fall in love, while James, a sadistic vampire from another coven, is drawn to hunt down Bella. Edward and the other Cullens defend Bella. She escapes to Phoenix, where she is tricked into confronting James, who tries to kill her. She is seriously wounded, but Edward rescues her and they return to Forks. New Moon Edward and his family leave Forks because he believes he is endangering Bella's life. Bella goes into a depression until she develops a strong friendship with Jacob Black, who she discovers can shape-shift into a wolf. Jacob and the other wolves in his tribe must protect her from Victoria, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate James. Due to a misunderstanding, Edward believes Bella is dead. Edward decides to commit suicide in Volterra, Italy, but is stopped by Bella, who is accompanied by Edward's sister, Alice. They meet with the Volturi, a powerful vampire coven, and are released only on the condition that Bella be turned into a vampire in the near future. Bella and Edward are reunited, and she and the Cullens return to Forks. Eclipse Victoria has created an army of \\"newborn\\" vampires to battle the Cullen family and murder Bella for revenge. Meanwhile, Bella is compelled to choose between her relationship with Edward and her friendship with Jacob. Edward's vampire family and Jacob's werewolf pack join forces to successfully destroy Victoria and her vampire army. In the end, Bella chooses Edward's love over Jacob's friendship and agrees to marry Edward. Breaking Dawn Bella and Edward are married, but their honeymoon is cut short when Bella discovers that she is pregnant. Her pregnancy progresses rapidly, severely weakening her. She nearly dies giving birth to her and Edward's half- vampire-half-human daughter, Renesmee. Edward injects Bella with his venom to save her life and turns her into a vampire. A vampire from another coven sees Renesmee and mistakes her for an \\"immortal child\\". She informs the Volturi, as the existence of such beings violates vampire law. The Cullens gather vampire witnesses who can verify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. After an intense confrontation, the Cullens and their witnesses convince the Volturi that the child poses no danger to vampires or their secret, and they are left in peace by the Volturi. Main characters * Bella Swan: The protagonist of the series, teenager Bella is a perpetually clumsy \\"danger magnet\\" with dark brown hair and brown eyes. She is often portrayed as having low self-esteem and unable to comprehend Edward's love for her. She has an immunity to supernatural abilities involving the mind, such as Edward's mind-reading ability. After her transformation into a vampire in the saga's fourth installment, Bella acquires the ability to shield both herself and others from \\"mental harm\\" from other vampires. * Edward Cullen: Edward is a vampire who lives with a coven of like-minded vampires known as the Cullen family, who feed on animals rather than humans. Over the course of the Twilight series, Edward falls in love with, marries, and then has a child with Bella. At first, Edward feels a mutual hatred toward Jacob Black because of his love for Bella, but in Breaking Dawn, he comes to see Jacob as a brother and friend. Like some vampires, Edward has a supernatural ability: mind reading. It allows him to read anyone's thoughts within a few miles' radius. Bella is immune to his power as a human, but learns how to lower this \\"shield\\" after her transformation to a vampire. * Jacob Black: A minor character in the first novel, Jacob is introduced as a member of the Quileute tribe. He resurfaces in New Moon with a larger role as Bella's best friend as she struggles through her depression over losing Edward. Although he is in love with Bella, she initially sees him as just her best friend. He and other tribe members can shape-shift into wolves. In Eclipse Bella realizes that while she does love Jacob, her feelings for Edward Cullen are stronger. In Breaking Dawn, Jacob imprinted on Bella and Edward's baby daughter, Renesmee, ridding him of his heartache for Bella. Setting Forks, Washington The story is set primarily in the town of Forks, Washington, where Bella and her father, Charlie Swan, live. Other cities in Washington briefly appear in the series or are mentioned, such as Port Angeles, Olympia, Seattle and La Push. Some events in Twilight take place in Phoenix, Arizona, where Bella was raised. Volterra, Italy, is featured in New Moon, when Edward travels there to commit suicide and Bella rushes to save him. Jacksonville, Florida, is mentioned first in Twilight and second in Eclipse, when Edward and Bella visit Bella's mother, who has moved there with her new husband. Seattle, Washington, is featured in Breaking Dawn when Jacob tries to escape his love for Bella, and when Bella tries to locate a man named J. Jenks. It is also the location of a series of murders committed by newborn vampires in Eclipse. In Breaking Dawn, Bella and Edward spend their honeymoon on a fictional \\"Isle Esme\\", purportedly off the coast of Brazil. Structure and genre The Twilight series falls under the genre of young adult, fantasy, and romance, though Meyer categorized her first book, Twilight, as \\"suspense romance horror comedy\\". However, she states that she considers her books as \\"romance more than anything else\\". The series explores the unorthodox romance between human Bella and vampire Edward, as well as the love triangle between Bella, Edward, and Jacob, a werewolf. The books avoid delving into provocative sex, drugs, and harsh swearing because, according to Meyer, \\"I don't think teens need to read about gratuitous sex.\\" The books are written in first-person narrative, primarily through Bella's eyes with the epilogue of the third book and a part of the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: > I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's > about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the > book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there‚ÄìAnne > Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and > blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of > people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with > different descriptions. The books are based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of particulars from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, > It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to > think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different > from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that > point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so > forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me. Inspiration and themes According to the author, her books are \\"about life, not death\\" and \\"love, not lust\\". Each book in the series was inspired by and loosely based on a different literary classic: Twilight on Jane Austen's 1813 novel Pride and Prejudice, New Moon on Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, Eclipse on Emily Bront√´'s 1847 novel Wuthering Heights, and Breaking Dawn on a second Shakespeare play, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Meyer also states that Orson Scott Card and L. M. Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series are a big influence on her writing. The Cullens were inspired by Meyer's own familyWhy Stephenie Meyer is scared of fame as well as characters from the X-Men cartoon. Other influences on the series which Meyer has acknowledged include the 1847 novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´, HGTV, and the films Iron Man (2008), Somewhere in Time (1980), Stranger than Fiction (2006), and Baby Mama (2008). Other major themes of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are centered around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: \\"I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what you think you have to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path.\\" Meyer, a Mormon, acknowledges that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, she says that her characters \\"tend to think more about where they came from, and where they are going, than might be typical.\\" Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, \\"I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There's always going to be a lot of light in my stories.\\" Origins and publishing history Stephenie Meyer says that the idea for Twilight came to her in a dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the transcript of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005. Following the success of Twilight, Meyer expanded the story into a series with three more books: New Moon (2006), Eclipse (2007), and Breaking Dawn (2008). In its first week after publication, the first sequel, New Moon, debuted at #5 on the New York Times Best Seller List for Children's Chapter Books, and in its second week rose to the #1 position, where it remained for the next eleven weeks. In total, it spent over 50 weeks on the list. After the release of Eclipse, the first three \\"Twilight\\" books spent a combined 143 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List. The fourth installment of the Twilight series, Breaking Dawn, was released with an initial print run of 3.7 million copies. Over 1.3 million copies were sold on the first day alone, setting a record in first-day sales performance for the Hachette Book Group USA. Upon the completion of the fourth entry in the series, Meyer indicated that Breaking Dawn would be the final novel to be told from Bella Swan's perspective. In 2008 and 2009, the four books of the series claimed the top four spots on USA Today's year-end bestseller list, making Meyer the first author to ever achieve this feat. The series then won the 2009 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Book, where it competed against the Harry Potter series. Other books Graphic novels On March 16, 2010 Yen Press released Twilight: The Graphic Novel, Vol. 1, by artist Young Kim based on the first book in the series. In February 2011, the graphic novel won the 2010 Gem Awards Best Manga of the Year. The sequel, Twilight: The Graphic Novel, Vol. 2 was released on October 11, 2011 and followed Volume 1 in topping The New York Times Best Seller list for Hardcover Graphic Books in its first week. Midnight Sun In November 2008, Meyer announced plans to write a companion book to Twilight, titled Midnight Sun, which would be the same story told from Edward Cullen's perspective. She stated that the first novel was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's point-of-view. A rough draft of Midnight Sun first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet in 2011. This prompted Meyer to place the rough draft of these twelve chapters on her website so that fans could read them for free, but placed the project on hold indefinitely stating that she had no plans in officially releasing the book. Meyer also stated that if she were to continue writing followups to the original series, she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Renesmee Cullen. In May 2020, Meyer announced that Midnight Sun will be released on August 4, 2020. The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner On March 30, 2010, Meyer revealed on her official website that she will be releasing a new novella in the series, The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner, which tells the story of a newborn vampire who appeared in Eclipse, on June 5, 2010. An electronic version of the book was made available free from her web site, as well as in bookstores. Companions On October 5, 2010, Little, Brown and Company announced that The Twilight Saga: The Official Illustrated Guide, a definitive encyclopedic reference for the saga including character profiles, outtakes, a conversation with Meyer, genealogical charts, maps and extensive cross-references with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was to be released on April 12, 2011, after many publication delays since 2008. It debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, where it stayed for three consecutive weeks, and at #4 on the USA Today Best Seller list. Life and Death On October 6, 2015, Little, Brown and Company released the Twilight Tenth Anniversary/Life and Death Dual Edition, which includes a nearly-400 page reimagining of the novel with Edward and Bella gender-swapped as Edythe and Beau. The reimagined novel has a more conclusive ending, seemingly precluding its continuation through the remaining three Twilight novels. Reception The response to Twilight has been mixed. While the books have become immensely popular, they have also generated much controversy. Positive reception Twilight has gathered acclaim for its popularity with its target readers. The Times lauded it for capturing \\"perfectly the teenage feeling of sexual tension and alienation.\\" Other reviews described Twilight as an \\"exquisite fantasy\\", and a \\"gripping blend of romance and horror\\". Lev Grossman of Time wrote that the books have a \\"pillowy quality distinctly reminiscent of Internet fan fiction\\", but still praised the series, comparing it to The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter: The Seattle Post-Intelligencer called the book a \\"hot new teen novel\\", Entertainment Weekly called Meyer \\"the world's most popular vampire novelist since Anne Rice\\", The New York Times described Twilight as a \\"literary phenomenon\\", and Matt Arado of Daily Herald noted that the Twilight books have become the \\"hottest publishing phenomenon since a certain bespectacled wizard cast his spell on the world.\\" The large and diverse online fan community of the series are often noted, sometimes even being called \\"cult-like\\". Despite this, the series is often considered to have a wider appeal; Crystal Mack of Daily Herald said, \\"While teenage girls are the main audience, young boys and adults of both genders have also been swept up in the phenomenon.\\" The author and the series' popularity are often compared with J. K. Rowling and Harry Potter. Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, \\"Meyer's fandom is reminiscent of Harry Potter mania.\\" The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the \\"spiritual successor to Harry Potter\\". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a \\"huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them.\\" According to the Daily Telegraph, \\"Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter.\\" Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, \\"It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's never going to be another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again\\", however noting that \\"you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [than me to her]. I do think that we both have people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters.\\" A store catering to tourists interested in the Twilight series in Forks, Washington. Economically, the town of Forks, Washington, the setting for the Twilight series, has improved due to tourism from fans of the books. Forks is visited by an average of 8,000 tourists per month, and has been described as a \\"mecca for Twilighters\\". In response to plans for the aging Forks High School to be renovated, Twilight fans have teamed up with Infinite Jewelry Co. and the West Olympic Peninsula Betterment Association to collect donations in an attempt to save the brick appearance or the building altogether. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed The Twilight Series on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Negative reception The series has garnered some notoriety both over its literary substance and over the type of relationship portrayed in the books. Many have derided the series as poor writing. While comparing Stephenie Meyer to J. K. Rowling, Stephen King said, \\"the real difference [between Rowling and Meyer] is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer, and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good.\\".. However, King understood the appeal of the series, adding, \\"People are attracted by the stories, by the pace and in the case of Stephenie Meyer, it's very clear that she's writing to a whole generation of girls and opening up kind of a safe joining of love and sex in those books. It's exciting and it's thrilling and it's not particularly threatening because it's not overtly sexual.\\" A quote from Robin Browne (though frequently misattributed to King or Andrew Futral) negatively compares the Twilight and Harry Potter book series: \\"Harry Potter is about confronting fears, finding inner strength and doing what is right in the face of adversity‚Ä¶ Twilight is about how important it is to have a boyfriend\\". Laura Miller of Salon.com wrote that \\"the characters, such as they are, are stripped down to a minimum, lacking the texture and idiosyncrasies of actual people\\", and said that \\"Twilight would be a lot more persuasive as an argument that an 'amazing heart' counts for more than appearances if it didn't harp so incessantly on Edward's superficial splendors.\\" Elizabeth Hand of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Meyer's prose seldom rises above the serviceable, and the plotting is leaden.\\" The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, \\"Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is something more than just an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on.\\". Controversy The books have also been widely critiqued as promoting, normalizing, and idealizing an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Sci-fi website io9 noted that Bella and Edward's relationship meets all fifteen criteria set by the National Domestic Violence Hotline for being in an abusive relationship. L. Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the Twilight books in his library because he felt the books were \\"robbing [teen girls] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior.\\" Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried Twilight as promoting an anti-woman message. Bitch magazine stated the novels \\"had created a new, popular genre of \\"abstinence porn\\", concluding that, \\"In reality, the abstinence message‚Äîwrapped in the genre of abstinence porn‚Äîobjectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity with the loss of other things, including her sense of self and her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted when we get to the sex scenes in Breaking Dawn.\\" Ms. declared that Twilight promotes a physically abusive relationship and an anti-abortion message. However, writer Angela Aleiss of Religion News Service said that contrary to popular opinion, Mormons do permit abortion when the mother's life is in danger. Bella's refusal to abort her fetus, along with her quick marriage and pregnancy, instead underscore the Mormon emphasis on family.Angela Aleiss, \\"Mormon Influence, Imagery Runs Deep through Twilight\\", Religion News Service, June 23, 2010. Various psychology experts have come out in agreement with the assessment of the relationship as abusive. Melissa Henson, Director of communication and public education for the Parents Television Council, stated: Many entertainment and media outlets have made similar comments on the abusive nature of Bella and Edward's relationship, including Entertainment Weekly, Movieline, and Mediabistro.com. Meyer has dismissed such criticisms, arguing both that the books center around Bella's choice, which she perceives as the foundation of modern feminism, and that Bella's damsel in distress persona is due only to her humanity. Meyer also added, \\"Just because [Bella] doesn't do kung fu and she cooks for her father doesn't make her worthy of that criticism\\". Shannon Simcox of The Daily Collegian has similarly dismissed the criticism surrounding Bella, commenting, \\"While Bella plays the perfect damsel in distress that gets herself into sticky situations, she is also very in control of herself. She chose to move to Forks and be in a new place; she constantly faces a bunch of people who want to suck the life right out of her, and she is constantly pleading to become a vampire, too, so she can take care of herself and Edward.\\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/06/opinions/the-new- twilight-novel-we-dont-need-thomas/index.html Legal issues In December 2010, professional singer Matthew Smith, known as Matt Heart, sued Summit Entertainment in the case Smith v. Summit Entertainment LLC. Smith's song \\"Eternal Knight\\" was posted on several websites accompanied by cover art which Summit claimed used its \\"Twilight\\" typeface mark. Smith won four of the seven causes of action, including his right to continue distribution of his copyrighted song, under the terms that he remove any reference to \\"Twilight\\" or the \\"Twilight Saga\\". Book challenges The Twilight series made the number five spot on the American Library Association's (ALA) Top Ten List of the Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2009, for being \\"Sexually Explicit\\", \\"Unsuited to Age Group\\", and having a \\"Religious Viewpoint\\".. Film adaptations A screenplay for Twilight was written by Melissa Rosenberg and has been adapted into a film by Summit Entertainment. The film was directed by Catherine Hardwicke, with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the leading roles of Isabella Swan and Edward Cullen, respectively. The movie was released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Twilight: The Complete Illustrated Movie Companion, written by Mark Cotta Vaz, was released October 28.

They then published a paper titled \\"The Homeland Belongs to All,\\" which discussed Cuba's human rights situation and called for political and economic reforms. They also called for a boycott of elections in Cuba's one-party system and for investors to avoid Cuba, giving several news conferences to discuss their concerns. A The Los Angeles Times columnist described Roca and Bonne's criticism carrying extra weight as \\"the only known black dissidents in Cuba\\", stating that \\"Given Castro's claim that the revolution has ended racial discrimination, he can ill afford to let well-educated blacks challenge him, even as gently as the four defendants had done.\\" Roca and the other members of the group were arrested on 16 July 1997. The four were detained for nineteen months and then tried for sedition in March 1999 in a one-day trial closed to foreign press. Roca was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. The defendants became known as the \\"Group of Four\\". The US, EU, Canada, and the Vatican all called for his release. Amnesty International declared the four prisoners of conscience, \\"detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association\\", and called for their immediate release. Roque, Bonne and G√≥mez were released in May 2000, but Roca was held for an additional two years. The Human Rights Committee of the US National Academy of Sciences speculated that he was \\"singled out for particularly severe treatment because he had been a member of the Cuban Communist Party and his father had been one of its founding members\\".\\"Cuban Economist Vladimiro Roca Released from Prison\\".

CNN described the early release as \\"apparently a conciliatory gesture\\" by Castro ahead of a visit by former US president Jimmy Carter. Roca told reporters, \\"I plan to continue working like I was before being arrested ... to continue the struggle because I believe I will see a change in Cuba before too long.\\" Roca met with Carter a week after his release.  Later activism  In March 2003, Roca, Roque, and Elizardo Sanchez lobbied the European Union not to sign a trade agreement with Cuba. Roca stated that \\"we do not believe a country with such a black human rights record should be allowed to join\\". Roca also criticized the EU's 2008 lifting of sanctions against Cuba, accusing leaders of pushing the measure through against the popular will. In May 2005, Roca and Roque organized a meeting of 200 dissidents which, unusually, was not interrupted by police. Roque described it as \\"the first such gathering in Fidel Castro's 46 years of communist rule\\" and \\"a point of departure\\" for further discussion.

Early life Briwere was the nephew of William Brewer, a baron and political leader during King Henry III of England's minority.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 213 Nothing else is known of the younger Briwere's family or where he was educated. He owed the office of precentor at Exeter Cathedral to his uncle's influence, receiving that office about 1208.Barlow \\"Brewer, William\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Briwere was nominated about 25 November 1223 and consecrated on 21 April 1224. His elevation had been supported by Hubert de Burgh as a means of drawing Briwere's uncle over to the side of de Burgh.Vincent Peter des Roches pp. 230‚Äì232 Crusading bishop Briwere participated in the Sixth Crusade as a proxy for his uncle, who died before he was able to fulfill his crusading vows. The elder Briwere had taken the cross in 1189, but was excused temporarily because of his administrative duties. The nephew had released for his use 4000 marks that had been deposited with the Templars in the Holy Land by his uncle. Briwere went on the crusade with Peter des Roches, who was Bishop of Winchester. An army of other crusaders accompanied them to the East, although whether they were English or mercenaries recruited on the Continent is unclear. The contingent left from Brindisi in August 1227.Tyerman God's War pp. 744‚Äì745 Both bishops were influential advisors to Frederick II the Holy Roman Emperor. Pope Gregory IX had ordered that no one collaborate with Frederick, who was at the time excommunicate, but both bishops ignored the papal orders and worked closely with Frederick's agents and Frederick himself. The financial resources both bishops brought were especially appreciated by the crusaders.Tyerman England and the Crusades pp. 99‚Äì101 Both bishops witnessed the treaty on 18 February 1229 with the Sultan of Cairo that restored Jerusalem to the Christians, the Treaty of Jaffa. Briwere visited Jerusalem after this. How quickly Briwere returned to England is uncertain. Some historians have it that he was back in England by 1229. Others, however point out that he is not attested as being in England until April 1231, and maintain that he travelled with des Roches, who dawdled in Italy for a time. Time in England While bishop, Briwere introduced the Dominican Order into his diocese.Vincent Peter des Roches p. 234 He also set up the offices of dean and chancellor of the Exeter Cathedral chapter, allowing the chapter to elect those officers. He also issued a set of statutes for the diocese, based on those recently issued for the diocese of Salisbury. Briwere was also employed by the king on diplomatic missions, going twice to France and also escorting Henry's sister Isabella to her marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1235. Briwere died on 24 October 1244.Fryde, et al.

The song reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 11 April 1963, where it stayed for three weeks. History The song was written by Mitch Murray, who offered it to Adam Faith and Brian Poole but was turned down. George Martin of EMI, feeling the song had enormous hit potential, decided to pick it up for the new group he was producing, the Beatles, as the A-side of their first record. The Beatles recorded the song on 4 September 1962 with Ringo Starr on drums. The group was initially opposed to recording it, feeling that it did not fit their sound, but worked out changes from Murray's demo-disc version. These included a new introduction, vocal harmony, an instrumental interlude, small lyric changes and removal of the half-step modulation for the last verse. Although Murray disliked their changes, the decision not to release the Beatles' version was primarily a business one.Lewisohn (2013), p. 699 In fact, George Martin came very close to issuing \\"How Do You Do It?\\" as the Beatles' first single before settling instead on \\"Love Me Do\\", recorded during the same sessions. Martin commented later: \\"I looked very hard at 'How Do You Do It?', but in the end I went with 'Love Me Do', it was quite a good record.\\" McCartney would remark: \\"We knew that the peer pressure back in Liverpool would not allow us to do 'How Do You Do It'.\\" The Beatles' version of \\"How Do You Do It?\\" was officially unissued for over 30 years, finally seeing release in November 1995 on the retrospective Anthology 1. While the Beatles' recording remained in the vaults, Martin still had faith in the song's appeal. Consequently, he had another new client, Gerry and the Pacemakers, record \\"How Do You Do It?\\" as their debut single in early 1963. This version of \\"How Do You Do It?\\", also produced by Martin, became a number-one hit in the UK until it was replaced by \\"From Me to You\\" (the Beatles' third single). It was the title song of a 7-inch EP that also featured \\"Away From You\\", \\"I Like It\\" and \\"It's Happened to Me\\" (Columbia SEG8257, released July 1963). Gerry and the Pacemakers' version of \\"How Do You Do It?\\" was initially issued in the US and Canada in the spring of 1963, but made no impact on the charts. After the group had issued several chart singles in North America, the track was reissued in the summer of 1964. \\"How Do You Do It?\\" entered the US charts on 5 July 1964, eventually reaching number nine; it did even better in Canada, peaking at number six.

The two main economic activities in Luƒçko are trade in goods, mainly in the retail sector, and the rendering of commercial services. History Luƒçko dates back to the 18th century, when it was noted as the first local village with a river crossing. The name derives from the Croatian word \\"luka\\" which translates to \\"harbor\\". The oldest church in the village can be traced back to the year 1779. As of the 2011 census, Luƒçko had a total population of 3,010. This corresponds to a population increase of 50% when compared to the census held in 1991. Luƒçko Airport Luƒçko Airport The Luƒçko airport is one of the oldest facilities in Luƒçko and one of the main reasons for the establishment of Luƒçko as a neighborhood. In 1947, it had become Zagreb's main airport, replacing the obsolete Borongaj airport. It remained Zagreb's main airport for a period of 15 years, up to the year 1962, when Zagreb Airport had been completed at its contemporary location near Pleso.

The national higher education system is in accordance with the Bologna process, with bachelor's degrees (first cycle, three years), master's degrees (second cycle, two years) and doctoral degrees (third cycle, three years). Acceptance is offered after finishing upper secondary school with general university admissions certification. Public education is free, with an academic year with two semesters, from August to December and from January to June. The ultimate responsibility for the education lies with the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. The main building of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The University of Oslo, established in 1811, is the oldest university in Norway  System  Admission Acceptance to higher education requires either fulfilled three years of upper secondary school with general university admissions certification. This is awarded non-vocational students or vocational students who choose to not take their apprenticeship. Conversely study competence can be achieved by the so-called 23/5 rule where applicants must be 23 years of age and have a total of five years of upper secondary education and work experience as well as have passed courses in Norwegian, English, mathematics, science and social studies. To be accepted as certain lines (for instance engineering) advanced courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry must be passed. Admission to bachelor level programs is coordinated through the Norwegian Universities and Colleges Admission Service based on a point scale, with the highest ranking students offered a place. Points are awarded based on average grades from upper secondary school, but additional points are awarded students with secondary two-year course specialization, science specialization, age and fulfilled one year of higher education, military service or folk high school. Secondary school grades can be improved to increase points, but 40% of the places are only offered based on original transcripts without age or study points. Structure 250px In 2003 a national reform, called the Quality reform, was implemented throughout the entire national higher education system. Norway was one of the first countries in Europe to implement the Bologna convention, thus creating a 3+2+3 year system in accordance with the Bologna Process. A further step was taken in 2005 when the Act Relating to Universities and University Colleges and the Private Higher Education Institutions Act were merged into one common Act, the Act relating to universities and university colleges.Act relating to Universities and University Colleges published 09.02.2006 The common act ensures greater equality between the public and private higher education institutions, thus focusing more on the quality in higher education than ownership. The evaluation of Quality Assurance Systems at and accreditation of both public and private institutions are handled by a national agency for quality assurance, NOKUT. First Cycle Most students that fulfill the requirements for entrance to higher education in Norway are accepted to three- year Bachelor programs. Second Cycle Entrance to the two-year master programs are based upon the academic qualifications (grades) from the bachelor level. Some programs (including architecture, business management at NHH, engineering at NTNU), Master of Dentistry and Master of Laws are five-year programs (one-tier degrees). Three types of master's degrees are offered: Master of Science (science and business), Master of Philosophy (humanities and social studies) and Master of Technology (engineering). =Professional Degrees= Some professional oriented programs have been granted an exemption from the Bologna system. Physicians (cand.med.), veterinarians (cand.med.vet.), psychologist (cand.psychol.) and theologians (cand.theol.) are therefore still awarded degrees for six years of study. Third Cycle Doctor Philosophae degrees are awarded after three years of research-oriented education. Most programs also include one year of compulsory teaching as part of the education, making the total length of the program four years. System of Grading According to the ECTS-system the grading are given according to scale of six grades, ranging from an A to F, with A being the best and E the worst passing grade. F is a fail. A normal study progression awards 60 credits (stp) per year (30 per semester), most institutions either use a 7.5 or a 10 credit block system. Examinations are usually held every semester, in December and June, although exceptions occur. Old system Prior to 2002 the higher education in Norway had a significantly different system of education with roots back to the start of higher education in the country. It was based on a 3.5 or 4 year cand.mag. degree supplemented with a Masters or hovedfag lasting 1.5 or 2 years. Total study time was five years within sciences while it was six years within social studies and humanities. Master's degrees were named based on the line of study, for instance cand.scient. within science, cand.polit. in political studies or cand.oecon. within economics. Certain professional studies, such as medicine, law, and some engineering and business administration courses had professional studies that offered full-length degrees (without issuing cand.mag. titles). The titles awarded were cand.jur. (law, 6 years), cand.med. (medical doctor, 6 years), cand.psychol. (doctor of psychology, 6 years), sivil√∏konom (business administration, 4 years) or sivilingeni√∏r (engineering, 4.5 years). NHH had a monopoly educating sivil√∏konoms while NTH had a monopoly educating sivilingeni√∏rs. Doctorate studies were offered on top of the masters. Grading was performed on a 1.0 to 4.0 system, with 1.0 as the best grade and 4.0 the worst passing grade. A total of 41 different grades could be awarded with the system. Credits (then called vekttall) were issued based on a nominal study of 20 credits per year (or 10 per semester). Institutions Universities Traditionally there were only four universities in Norway, located in Oslo (since 1811), Bergen (1948), Trondheim (1968) and Troms√∏ (1972). Since 2005 any college offering five master programs and four doctoral programs can title themselves a university, leading to the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Stavanger University College and Agder University College converting to universities. The public universities of Norway are: * Nord University (Several campuses in North Tr√∏ndelag and Nordland counties) * Norwegian University of Life Sciences (√Ös) * Norwegian University of Science and Technology (Trondheim, √Ölesund and Gj√∏vik) * University of Agder (Kristiansand, Grimstad and Arendal) * University of Bergen * University of Oslo *University of Southeastern-Norway * University of Stavanger * University of Troms√∏ Currently there are no private universities in Norway, although BI Norwegian Business School has tried to advance to a full university. Specialised universities There are six public and three private specialised universities in Norway, each functioning as a national competence centre for the field they represent. Six are located in Oslo, one is in Molde, one is in Bergen and one in Stavanger. The Norwegian Institute of Technology and the Norwegian College of Agriculture have converted to full universities. The public specialised universities in Norway are: *Oslo School of Architecture and Design, or Arkitektur- og designh√∏gskolen i Oslo (official site) *Molde University College, or H√∏gskolen i Molde (official site) *Norwegian School of Economics, or Norges Handelsh√∏yskole (official site) *Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, or Norges idrettsh√∏gskole (official site) *Norwegian Academy of Music, or Norges musikkh√∏gskole (official site) *Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, or Norges vetrin√¶rh√∏gskole (official site) The private specialised universities are: *MF Norwegian School of Theology, or Det teologiske Menighetsfakultet (official site) *VID Specialized University in Olso, Stavanger, Sandness, Tromso VID vitenskapelige h√∏gskole (official site) University colleges The 23 university colleges in Norway are responsible for regional education of primarily bachelor level education within the fields of nursing, teaching, business management, engineering and information technology, though most colleges also offer a number of other educations as well. The public university colleges in Norway consist of: *Bergen National Academy of the Arts, or Kunsth√∏gskolen i Bergen (official site) *Bergen University College, or H√∏gskolen i Bergen (official site) *Hedmark University College, or H√∏gskolen i Hedmark (official site) *Lillehammer University College, or H√∏gskolen i Lillehammer (official site) *Norwegian Police University College, or Politih√∏gskolen (official site) *Oslo National Academy of the Arts, or Kunsth√∏gskolen i Oslo (official site) *Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences, or H√∏gskolen i Oslo og Akershus (official site) *S√°mi University of Applied Sciences, or Samisk h√∏gskole (official site) *Standyou, or Aditya Singh () *Stord/Haugesund University College, or H√∏gskolen i Stord/Haugesund (official site) *Volda University College, or H√∏gskolen i Volda (official site) *√òstfold University College, or H√∏gskolen i √òstfold (official site) The accredited private university colleges in Norway are: *BI Norwegian Business School, or Handelsh√∏yskolen BI Dronning Mauds Minne H√∏gskole *Diakonhjemmet University College, or Diakonhjemmet H√∏gskole (official site) *NLA University College, or NLA H√∏gskolen (official site) *Queen Maud University College or Dronning Mauds Minne H√∏gskole (official site) Private institutions There are a number of private higher education institutions in Norway, although the public institution cover more than ninety per cent of the student population in the country, meaning that less than ten per cent of students attend private institutions.Higher Education in Norway The private institutions offer primarily programs and courses within popular fields of study where the number of public places is limited or offering accelerated courses. However some provide specialised courses not found in the public institutions such as Noroff University College in Kristiansand. Most of the private institutions are foundations, either autonomous (like the BI Norwegian Business School and Campus Kristiania) or part of various religious societies, like the School of Missions and Theology or Queen Maud University College. Students attending private institutions may have to pay school fees equivalent to the entire cost of operating the education, though the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund will grant loans to cover the tuition fees. Student welfare and economics There are no tuition fees for attending public higher education in Norway, as all the costs are covered by the Ministry of Education and Research. Students are also given the opportunity to apply for financial support (a part loan/part grant) from the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund. The main requirement for support from Fund is that you are a Norwegian citizen. However, foreign citizens may also be entitled to financial support. Eligible applicants may be granted financial support (a part loan/part grant) of about NOK 90,000. It is initially given as a full loan, but upon completion of modules in the education around 40 percent of the amount is transferred to a scholarship/grant if the modules are passed. There is no interest paid while taking the education. While studying, all students belong to a student welfare organisation that takes care of such services as housing, on-campus dining, book stores, kindergartens, advisory services and some health care. Part of this is finances through a student fee, typically at NOK 300‚Äì500 per semester. There are a total of 25 such organisations, each covering a geographic area and often consisting of more than one institution. The sole exception is Oslo where there are two. Programs The five main universities in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Troms√∏ and Stavanger all offer a wide selection of courses within most fields, while certain minor fields have been left to the specialised universities, including veterinary studies and sports. Many educations are left to the regional colleges. Architecture Architecture is only offered at two public institutions, NTNU in Trondheim and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In addition the private college Bergen School of Architecture offers architect education. NTNU accepts students based on grades while the Oslo School accepts students based on a portfolio. Landscape architecture and area planning is offered at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences at √Ös. Business administration Most business administrators are educated at the regional colleges throughout the country, with Bachelor programs offered in Alta, Troms√∏, Narvik, Bod√∏, Steinkjer, Trondheim, Molde, √Ölesund, Sogndal, Bergen, Haugesund, Stavanger, Kristiansand, Kongsberg, Oslo, √Ös, Halden, Lillehammer, Gj√∏vik and Hamar. In addition NHH in Bergen is the specialised college offering the highest level of education within the field. Business administration is also offered at some private colleges, most notably the BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo. Eight institutions offer a Master of Science in Business Administration, also granting the right to use the protected title sivil√∏konom. These are Bod√∏ Graduate School of Business, Trondheim Business School, Molde University College, the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration, the University of Stavanger, the University of Agder, BI Norwegian Business School and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Until the 1980s this level of education was only offered at NHH. Engineering In general, three-year bachelor's degrees in engineering are offered throughout the country at the regional colleges, most dominantly within the fields of construction, chemistry, electronics and informatics, though many others also exist. Five-year Master of Technology degrees are offered as well, primarily at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim and the University of Stavanger (UiS), though also at some other institutions to a lesser degree. Candidates with three years of education can apply to attend the last two years at NTNU or UiS to complete a Master's study. All Master engineers can use the protected title sivilingeni√∏r. NTNU offers 14 different programs in engineering, whereas UiS only offers 8 different studies in engineering. Law Juridical education is offered at the universities in Oslo, Bergen and Troms√∏. Education lasts five years, and after that you are given the title \\"Master i Rettsvitenskap\\", meaning a legal skilled person. For becoming a lawyer you need to work as lawyer apprentice (advokatfullmektig) for at least two years and have had five cases before a judge. Medicine Medicine is offered at the four of the five major universities in Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim and Troms√∏, who have close cooperation with the university hospitals in the cities. Medical education takes six years and still grants the old cand.med. degree. After school candidates are required 1.5 years of practice before being granted certification. After six additional years of work experience they are awarded specialist certification. Teaching There are two ways to become a qualified teacher in Norway. For primary and lower secondary levels a four- year general teacher education is offered at most regional colleges in the country. This education qualifies the teachers to teach all subjects offered in the lower levels of education in Norway, though it allows students to specialize in subjects. Preschool teaching is offered at some of the regional colleges too. For upper secondary school taking a degree at a university within the appropriate subject is the preferred course of line. After taking a degree, either at Bachelor or Master level, a one-year course in pedagogy is required before teacher certification is granted. To teach a particular subject at the upper secondary level, 60 credits in the appropriate field is required, making most teachers qualified to teach two or three subjects, though these are not absolute requirements.  Sciences  Virtually all education within the sciences are offered at the five major universities, in Bergen, Oslo, Trondheim, Troms√∏ and Stavanger, though some regional colleges have one-years or perhaps Bachelor programs in certain fields.

The series ran for three episodes, weekly on Sunday nights from September 15 to 29, 1963 on the highly touted \\"New ABC\\" as the network's attempt to bring back high-stakes game shows after the quiz show scandals of 1958. When 100 Grand made its debut, it had been two years since the last quiz show with a five-figure cash prize or higher (You Bet Your Life on NBC) had aired on any broadcast network; it would be over a decade before six-figure jackpots returned to television game shows. (Large jackpots were still seen at the time on bowling shows, such as NBC's Jackpot Bowling and ABC's own Make That Spare, both of which regularly offered jackpots over $10,000.) Game play One contestant, having possessed a knowledge or lead in a specific subject or field, asked questions of a professional on that same subject for cash. The player who stumped the professional for five weeks, had the show survived that long, would have had the privilege to answer five questions submitted by home viewers, and ended up with a grand total of $100,000 if successful. Only two contestants appeared on the series - one questioning a Civil War expert, the other questioning an opera expert. On the third show, both professionals stumped the amateurs, both of whom were awarded $1,000 savings bonds while the professionals each won $10,000. Episode status The series is believed to be destroyed through wiping. A promotional video featuring the set and a contestant exists, traded among private collectors.

In 1831 he obtained his medical doctorate in Vienna, afterwards serving as an assistant to Joseph Wattmann (1789‚Äì1866). In 1836 he worked as a professor at the Lyceum in Salzburg, returning to Vienna the following year as primary surgeon at the general hospital. In 1841 he became an associate professor in Vienna, where in 1842, he was appointed head of the second surgical clinic. In Vienna, he was a colleague of physician Joseph ≈†koda (1805‚Äì1881), and an instructor to Austrian-American dermapathologist Carl Heitzmann (1836‚Äì1896). He died in December 1865 from a malignant fever and blood poisoning, possibly due to a septic infection. Franz Schuh was a medical pioneer who advanced scientific surgical practices in Vienna. He is remembered for his pathophysiological research and his investigations of new surgical methods. In 1840 he is credited with performing the first successful pericardiocentesis (pericardiac aspiration), and in January 1847, he was the first Austrian physician to use ether as an anesthetic on a human patient.JAMA Surgery in Austria In 1906, the thoroughfare Franz-Schuh-Gasse in the Favoriten district of Vienna was named in his honor.

He along with his Tamil driver Betram Francis disappeared on August 15, 1990 as the Sri Lankan civil war was raging. He went missing on his way to the eastern city of Batticaloa from a nearby town of Valaichchenai. He was known for his Human Rights activity on behalf of the local civilians. The Jesuits believe that he was killed along with his driver. Biography Eugene John Hebert was born in Jennings, Louisiana, United States, on October 9, 1923. He joined the Jesuits on August 14, 1941 at the age of 17. After completion of Jesuit studies, he volunteered for the Sri Lanka Mission. He was accepted and arrived in September 1948. After serving a year in the eastern township of Batticaloa and another in Trincomalee at the Jesuit Colleges he went to Poona, India, for the study of Theology. He was ordained a priest on 24 March 1954. After returning to Sri Lanka in April 1956, he was assigned to St Joseph‚Äôs College in Trincomalee as a teacher and sports coach from 1956 to 1978. He was named principal there for a brief period. In the 1960s, private schools including Catholic colleges were taken over by the State, and Fr. Hebert was sent to Batticaloa to work at the Eastern Technical Institute, the joint Jesuit and Methodist technical institute, as its director. He was also the basketball coach from 1978 to 1990 at St Michael‚Äôs College in Batticaloa, where he achieved national championship status over several years. Fr. Hebert was a prominent member of the Batticaloa Peace Committee that has interceded on behalf of the many disappeared and missing people as part of the Sri Lankan civil war with both the Sri Lankan government officials and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) group. Incident During the mid part of August in 1990, there were number of massacres and counter massacres of civilians targeting both the minority Muslim and Tamil communities. Perpetrators were alleged to be the rebel LTTE as well as government soldiers belonging to various divisions. Following the massacre of a group of Muslims in the Kathankudy Mosque, the situation at the nearby ethnically mixed town of Valachchenai became tense with unruly Muslim mobs roving around targeting Tamils. Most Tamils from Valachchenai fled to refugee camps in the provincial capital of Batticaloa leaving behind a group of Catholic sisters, some girls and helpers trapped in a convent. The Bishop of Batticaloa sent Father Eugene Hebert on August 13 to Valachchenai to assist the trapped sisters and others as well as a security guarantee against an attack. On August 15, the Bishop of Batticaloa organized a security convoy from the city to bring back the trapped sisters and others. He informed Father Hebert to accompany the convoy on its way back from Valachchenai to Batticaloa. Instead Father Hebert informed the Bishop that as the situation was getting better he would leave on his own via a circuitous route through an ethnically mixed town called Eravur to Batticaloa as he had urgent matters to take care at the institute where he was the director. Father Hebert along with a Tamil boy Betram Francis was last seen riding a red Vespa scooter towards Batticaloa via Eravur. Reactions Sri Lankan government The Sri Lankan government believes that Father Hebert was killed by the rebel LTTE who were active around the Eravur area at the time of his disappearance. This apparently was in response to a written request for explanation by the local American Embassy. Amnesty International An Amnesty International report dated 1990 urged the Sri Lankan government to continue the investigation into the disappearance of Father Eugene Hebert. It noted that the local investigation by the local military authorities was inconclusive. Jesuits Local Jesuits such as Father Harry Miller believe that a mob of civilians may have waylaid and killed Father Hebert and Betram Francis and destroyed any evidence of the crime. The Jesuit organization believes that he is definitely dead due to foul play.

The methodology for scoring the MCI Screen was developed by Medical Care Corporation, a privately held California Corporation. It was derived from the protocol of the CERAD 10-word recall test. Validation The MCI Screen was validated in a study on 471 community dwelling adults whose scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale ranged from 0 (normal: N=119), 0.5 (mild cognitive impairment: N=95), to 1 (mild dementia: N=257).

After drawing 0‚Äì0 with Championship side Stoke City away the Lambs earned a home replay which they drew 1‚Äì1, but were knocked out 4‚Äì3 on penalties FA Cup 2006‚Äì07 Despite a fairly poor 2006/07 league campaign, Tamworth once again had a successful FA Cup run. After beating Burton Albion and Rushden & Diamonds Tamworth were drawn at home against Norwich City in the 3rd round, but lost 1‚Äì4. The Lambs battling against Norwich City Paul Merson The club completed perhaps their highest profile signing of all time on 23 February 2006, with the capture of former Arsenal, Aston Villa, Walsall and England midfielder Paul Merson. However, the arrangement meant that until the end of the season, the majority of Merson's wages were to be paid by the club he used to manage, Walsall. The arrangement only lasted two games, although Merson only played once in the 2‚Äì1 home loss to Halifax Town. Merson was dropped to the bench for the following game, a 5‚Äì0 defeat away to Grays Athletic. Merson announced his retirement from professional football as a player on 9 March 2006, less than a month after joining Tamworth. Relegation The Lambs celebrating a promotion back into the Conference National. Although the club finished in 21st position in the Conference National in the 2005/06 season (the second relegation position), the club were spared the drop after Canvey Island resigned from the league. Altrincham also avoided the drop with Scarborough suffering a total points deduction for an as yet undeclared breach of the league's rules. Just 18 days after the FA Cup 3rd round defeat to Norwich City, Tamworth manager Mark Cooper and assistant manager Richard Dryden where dismissed, due to the club been rooted to the foot of the table. They were replaced two days later by the former Tamworth managerial duo of first manager Gary Mills and assistant Darron Gee, who arrived two days later, they were both formally with Alfreton Town. Tamworth found a new lease of life under Mills and Gee, and at times looked like they had enough to remain in the Conference, but were eventually relegated after finishing in 22nd position, had the club have finished in 21st position (the final relegation place) they again would have been spared the drop, due to Boston United been relegated two divisions due to finance issues. Altrincham, ironically were the team who finished 21st and were re-instated to the Conference National for the second time in as many seasons, Tamworth and Boston United went on to both compete in the Conference North for the 2007/08 season. After finishing 15th in the 2007/08 season, Tamworth set their sights on a promotion back to the Conference National and by the end of April, they had achieved this by finishing 1st in the Conference North.

Career Educated at Dulwich College, Dulwich, London, prior to entering politics he served as a Vice Consul in Java between 1914 and 1920. He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Camberwell North West in 1924 but was defeated in 1929. He returned to the House of Commons in a by-election in 1930 as member for Bromley and sat until his death, which occurred during the 1945 general election. Polling took place on 5 July 1945. Campbell died 12 days later, but nine days before the declaration of the result. He was declared posthumously elected on 26 July 1945, provoking a by-election in his Bromley constituency. That contest was won by Harold Macmillan. (Coincidentally, Leslie Pym, the member for Monmouth, died exactly the same day and was also posthumously elected.)

Their fossils are commonly found as disarticulated sclerites, in the upper Mississippi Valley (northeastern Iowa, southeastern Wisconsin, central to western Wisconsin) and in Canada (Alberta). The exoskeleton is rounded anteriorly, with the thorax and sides of the tailshield (or pygidium) slightly tapering to about ‚Öî√ó of the width across the base of the spines at the back of the headshield (or cephalon). At the side corners of the pygidium there may be triangular or hooked spines, pointing backwards, while between the spines the posterior margin is at a 30-75¬∞ angle with the lateral margin, gently convex or nearly straight. If pygidial spines are lacking, the margin is gradually rounded. The thorax has 12 segments.  Distribution  The oldest known specimens of Dikelocephalus have been found in the upper part of the Tunnel City Group. Some of these early specimens, and only those, have been assigned to D. freeburgensis. These specimens may or may not be outside the wide morphological range of D. minnesotensis, but the analysis to establish this could not yet be done due to the absence of a sufficiently large collection from the collection site. Other specimen from the same deposit have confidently been assigned to D. minnesotensis however. D. minnesotensis also occurs in the Reno Member of the Lone Rock formation. The most common location of the species is the St. Laurence Formation, which directly overlies the deposits of the Tunnel City Group. The youngest know finds come from the Van Oser Member of the Jordan Formation, that in turn overlies the St. Laurence Formation.  Description  Dikelocephalus is a very large trilobite (approximately ), slightly longer than wide (1‚Öì√ó), widest across the base of the spines. The axis is less than half as wide as each of the pleural regions to its left and right. The headshield (or cephalon) and tailshield (or pygidium) are of approximately the same length (or isopygeous). It is rather variable in many of its characters. The cephalon is rounded at its front and terminates in narrow, long spines that may reach the pygidium. The sides of the thorax and pygidium are tapering, with the width across the base of the pygidial spines about ‚Öî of the width across the base of the genal spines. The cephalon may be covered in pustules in small specimens, but pustules get wider spaced and lower with size. central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is crossed by two furrows, the most backward almost straight defining the occipital ring, and the frontal one convex towards the back. There may be two further pairs of furrows, but these are not connected across the midline, the frontal pair directed outward and backward, and the second pair from the front outward. The occipital ring has a transverse ridge just in front of its back margin, and may have a tubercle in its middle. The front of the glabella is bluntly rounded, and the anterior glabellar furrow is shallow. The area in front of the glabella is flat or slightly downsloping, ¬Ω-‚Öì als long as the glabella. Border variously developed, short and low, with two to five slightly so-called terrace lines. Eyes lunar shaped, ‚Öì-¬º as long as the glabella, back perpendicular to the front of the occipital ring, midlength about as far from the glabella as the occipital ring is long. From the front of the eye the facial suture is directed forward and outward at ¬±30¬∞, only to curve abruptly forward and inward at the border furrow, crossing the margin at a variable location but not directly in front of the glabella. From the back of the eye the facial suture curves abruptly outward, to curve abruptly backward at halfwidth of the area outside the glabella (the cheek or gena). The rim of the hard exoskeleton tucked under at the ventral side of the cephalon (or doublure), is extremely wide, nearly reaching the ventral side of the eye, and has about 17 terrace lines. The palate (or hypostome) is attached to the anterior doublure, rectangular, wider than long, with tooth-like extensions where the hyposome meets the inner margin of the doublure and with a concave posterior margin. The few complete specimens that have been found have12 thorax segments. A postule in the middle of each axial ring may be present. Frontal margin perpendicular to the midline, but gradually curling backward further out. Tip blunt in frontal segments, ending in a short backward pointing spine for rear segments. Pygidium transversely elliptical with two triangular or inwardly curving spines. Axis ¬Ω-‚Öû√ó as long as the pygidium, with 4-5 rings and a terminal piece.  Growth  In Dikelocephalus allometric growth has been found for a number of characters. The glabella becomes relatively wider with size and in small specimens the glabella has small raised protrusions (or pustules), that become further spaced and lower with size, to become indiscernible in specimens over 10 cm. The relative length of the eye lobe decreases during ontogeny, although only slightly in larger specimens. Also the length of the pygidium (including the spines) relative to the pygidial axis reduces with size.  Taxonomy  Early analysis of the large morphological diversity in Dikelocephalus resulted in splitting up the genus into many \\"species\\" during the first half of the 20th century. After applying modern analysis methods like multivariate analysis, including principal component analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling at the end of the 20th century, it turned out the variation was continuous, and all specimens belonged to the same morphospecies. This results in a large number of synonyms for D. minnesotensis (see box). The only other putative species may be D. freeburgensis. The large variation in morphological characters in this early trilobite can be seen as an illustration of Rosa's Rule.  Reassigned species  The genus Dikelocephalus was established relatively early on, and as a consequence many species have since been reassigned to other genera. * D. iowensis = Crepicephalus iowensis * D. vanhornei = Walcottaspis vanhornei * D. corax = Bienvillia corax * D. br√∂ggeri = Tropidopyge broeggeri * D. roemeri = Elvinia roemeri * D. pepinensis = Saukiella pepinensis * D. crassimarginatus = Tellerina crassimarginatus * D. megalops = Richardsonella megalops * D. planifrons = Lauzonella planifrons * D. magnificus = Hungaia magnifica * D. sesostris = Pseudosaukia sesostris  Ecology  Dikelocephalus lived in shelf seas, in particular sandy or chalky areas of the inner shelf.

A sustainable MBA program includes these subjects, and also study of managing for environmental and social sustainability. These programs are sometimes called \\"green MBAs\\". Conceptual foundation Sustainability in these programs is generally defined to include economic, environmental, and social sustainability, collectively known as the Triple Bottom Line. For each of these domains, sustainability means that it will be possible to continue through the foreseeable future, at least, without major breakdowns, such as * Economic: running out of oil or other natural resources and having nothing to replace them on the scale required * Environmental: loss of habitat, species, and whole ecologies; global warming * Social: overpopulation beyond the carrying capacity of the earth; consequences of eliminating poverty within the current economic model The environmental and social justice movements are sources for many of the issues, arguments, and research on sustainability, but the idea has firm roots in classical economics. * Externalities: economically significant effects of manufacturing and trade on those who are not part of the industry or market in question. The classic example of a negative externality is pollution, while the largest current issue is global warming. The literature has identified many others, and many positive externalities, and has proposed many controversial measures to improve the balance. * Natural resources: conventional accounting, including national accounts, treats extraction of finite natural resources as income, priced at the cost of extraction, and not as depletion of non- renewable natural capital. The resources of nature come to us for free. They are of infinite value from the point of view of preserving and sustaining life, but may not be subject to trading in a market, as in the case of air for breathing, for agriculture, or for burning fuels. * The problem of value: conventional economics can describe the process of setting prices in a marketplace through the interaction of supply and demand, but cannot adequately explain value. (Though not for lack of trying. See Labor Theory of Value and Util for examples.) The most economists generally agree on is that an individual purchaser in a free market will only buy something worth more to that individual than the price, and that the seller values the goods less than the price, so that both sides come out ahead. * Participation: The free market is not free to those who have no access to it. One of the themes of sustainable MBA education is the extent to which environmental and social sustainability can be achieved at a profit, a question by no means answered fully. Sustainability MBA programs can vary significantly from one school to another, some may stress management, some may stress entrepreneurship, others simply add a few \\"green\\" classes to their existing MBA program. Many advise to look at a program's curriculum, history, vision, mission, and most of all, to go and attend a class before fully enrolling in a program, as transparency is espoused as core to a sustainable MBA. The longest running fully integrated sustainability graduate school (founded 2003) is Presidio Graduate School with MBA programs in San Francisco and Seattle.

Beyond Grey Pinstripes, a biennial ranking and program survey, published by the Aspen Institute is based on the integration of social, environmental, and ethical stewardship into university curriculum and faculty research. The ranking also weights significantly the extent to which students are exposed to these topics throughout their studies. Participation in the survey requires US-based schools possess accreditation; international schools must also be accredited or be recognized as leading institutions. The 2009-2010 cycle consisted of 149 participating universities. The top-ranked school with a specialization in sustainability, Schulich, is Canadian. 63% of these schools were based in the US, while the remaining 37% were located throughout 24 countries. Although survey information from all participating schools is made available online, the top participating schools were ranked in the Aspen's Global 100 list. The 2011-2012 survey and ranking again include data from 149 universities. Although not a ranking of business programs, Net Impact annually produces and publishes a graduate program guide titled Business as UNusual. The guide seeks to provide information about what graduate programs offer their students within the realm of corporate responsibility and sustainability. Data for the guide come from surveys completed by graduate student Net Impact chapter leaders and from chapter member surveys. The most recent report contains profiles of 95 business schools. Many MBA programs which offer sustainability degrees or concentrations also appear in general business school rankings. US News & World Report, Business Week, Financial Times, The Economist, and the Wall Street Journal all publish rankings of selected MBA programs. While the methodologies of each differ, most weight ranks heavily by employment and salary statistics, standardized test scores, and surveys of corporate recruiters. Criticism Followers of Milton Friedman and the Chicago school of economics often claim that business has no other duty than profits to shareholders, and that business therefore has a duty not to pursue environmental and social sustainability except where it increases profits. The extent to which such actions are profitable is much disputed. On the other hand, Friedman actually did not sayMilton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom: \\"There is one and only one social responsibility of business‚Äîto use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.\\" that the duty to shareholders was absolute: corporations also had a duty to obey the law and compete fairly. Friedman's criticism has been debunked by legal scholars (e.g., Stout 2002), who have shown that Friedman had no legal basis for his conclusion. Corporate executives do not legally need to run the corporation for shareholders and could, in fact, operate the corporation to benefit society and environment. The fact that Friedman misunderstood corporate governance is no surprise as it was not his area of expertise, and the fact that the NYT Magazine allowed the mistake is not a surprise as it is not a double blind peer reviewed academic journal. The debate must then turn to the question of what laws may properly be placed on corporate behavior to prevent fraud and other forms of malfeasance, and to ensure open and free competition, with what enforcement mechanisms. Also, whether corporate lobbying for subsidies and other legally- mandated advantages is fair, given that it is economically inefficient and indeed harmful. This question turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of governments, where results are decidedly mixed. It also turns in part on the honesty and effectiveness of public pressure groups. Results there are also decidedly mixed. Criticism of sustainable or \\"green MBAs\\" has also been heard from environmentalists and social activists. Some complain of corporate greenwashing, that is, of companies pretending to be sustainable or green by hiring graduates of these programs when the companies really are not.ThinktoSustain.com Interviews Giselle Weybrecht, Author of \\"The Sustainable MBA\\" Some complain that the programs themselves are not sustainable enough, pointing to weaknesses in their curriculum and core proposition. Another criticism relates to the sustainability skills gap. A recent study shows that business schools are too slow to adjust and the skills gap is broadening, regardless the recent surge of sustainable MBA programs. The report states that \\"environment and sustainability skills will be essential to plan the adaptations needed to survive and stay competitive\\", businesses unfortunately are ill prepared for these growing challenges and business schools are failing to offer enough environmental and ecological education, despite the increasing demand from businesses. In line with the IEMA report, several academics also criticize business schools emphasizing that the gap will be finally closed by those programs with sustainability at the core, which in most cases are emerging outside the business school world.

Desmond began his career in 1932 as the voice of the minor league Toledo Mud Hens. In 1940, he was promoted to broadcasting the games of the AAA Columbus Red Birds. Mel Allen was impressed enough with Desmond that he asked him to come to New York City as his sidekick on the home games of the Yankees and Giants in 1942. After one year, he left and joined Red Barber on the Dodgers broadcasts, replacing Al Helfer. During the 1943 season, Barber and Desmond were the only voices of baseball in New York; the Giants and Yankees suspended broadcasts that year for unknown reasons. Desmond remained with the Dodgers until 1956, teaming with Barber (1943‚Äì1953), Ernie Harwell (1948‚Äì1949), and Vin Scully (1950‚Äì1956). In the 1940s Desmond also teamed with Barber to call college football and New York Giants football, and with Marty Glickman to call college basketball and New York Knicks basketball. Desmond battled alcoholism for many years, and frequently missed games because he was too drunk to go on the air. Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley finally lost patience with him and fired him before the 1955 World Series. Thus, Desmond missed his chance to call the Dodgers' only world title on the East Coast. Desmond asked for and got another chance in 1956, but was fired for good after several more absences. He was succeeded by Jerry Doggett. Desmond was a fairly accomplished singer. In the early 1940s he hosted several music shows on WOR, with himself as the featured singer.http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/designated_hitter/002425-print.html Desmond died March 10, 1983 in Toledo, Ohio at the age of 75.

Questar's three major lines of business ‚Äî retail gas distribution, interstate gas transportation and gas production ‚Äî are conducted through its principal subsidiaries: Questar Gas, Questar Pipeline and Wexpro. Wexpro is an oil and natural gas producer in the Rocky Mountains. Previously known as Mountain Fuel Supply Company the company reorganized under a holding company in 1984 and is publicly traded as Questar Corporation. Mountain Fuel Supply formally changed its name to Questar Gas Company in 1998. History Questar Corporation's origins began in 1928, as a holding company named Western Public Service Corporation. That company was formed to bring natural gas to the Salt Lake City region of northern Utah from fields across the state border to the east in southwestern Wyoming. Mountain Fuel Supply Company was at that time the name of the holding company's oil and gas exploration and production affiliate.New Name For Mountain Fuel, New Logo For Questar Companies , PRNewswire, SOURCE Questar Gas Co., SALT LAKE CITY, Aug. 13, 1997 Mountain Fuel Supply In 1935, the shareholders voted to reorganize Western Public Service Corporation as a single company. Mountain Fuel Supply Company (MFS) then became the name of the reorganized consolidated company, which was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under that name from then until 1984.MOUNTAIN FUEL SUPPLY CO reports earnings for qtr to June 30, New York Times Archives, Published: July 28, 1983 Beginning in 1935, it also paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since that time.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, various issues In 1963, the company began to use a new trademark logo, in the shape of a trapezoid. That logo remained in use until becoming Questar Gas in 1998. Questar Corporation In 1984, Mountain Fuel Supply Company shareholders voted to return to the holding- company structure, and chose the name Questar Corporation as the new parent holding company name. Questar Corporation continues to trade on the NYSE, under its stock symbol STR. Questar's New Headquarters ‚Äî Questar Center Construction began in August 2010 on a new $45 million 6-story building at 333 South State Street in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. The new facility was completed and opened in March 2012. The building replaces Questar's former headquarters located at 180 East 100 South. The new Questar Center building is one of the first LEED Silver energy-efficient buildings in downtown Salt Lake. The new headquarters accommodates some 600 Questar employees in a floor plan that is 20 percent smaller than Questar's former headquarters. Employees working at Questar's D.N. Rose operation center in Salt Lake City will continue to operate from that location as well. Deregulation On January 1, 1998, Mountain Fuel Supply Company was renamed Questar Gas Company, bringing all of Questar's divisions under the single Questar brand name. The move was prompted by new deregulation in the energy industry, which allowed the company to offer wider choices to customers, and to venture into new lines of business. The old Mountain Fuel Supply name had been primarily associated with natural gas delivery up until that time. In 1998 the Questar Corporation also began to use its newly reworked version of the traditional trapezoid logo throughout the organization. At the time, R. D. Cash was chairman, president and chief executive officer of Questar Corporation. Other Questar affiliates were already moving into newly available energy market areas, such as Questar Energy Trading, which had begun to market electricity on the wholesale level, and Questar Energy Services, which had begun selling retail products including earthquake braces and carbon-monoxide monitors, and providing home-security and appliance-maintenance services. Also, Questar InfoComm began selling information technology and telecommunications. By 1998, Questar Corporation had become one of the largest companies headquartered in Utah, with 2,500 employees and about US$1.8 billion in assets. The company had two major divisions: *Regulated Services, included retail natural gas distribution and interstate natural gas transportation *Market Resources, included natural gas and oil exploration and production, wholesale and retail energy trading and marketing, natural gas gathering and other field services. In April 2003, D. N. \\"Nick\\" Rose, president and chief executive officer of Questar Regulated Services, retired and Alan K. Allred, who served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of the QRS group, succeed Rose. By 2006, the Regulated Services segment had been subdivided instead into segments named Questar Gas and Questar Pipeline, for a total of three primary subsiary companies within Questar, with four major lines of business:Full Description, Questar Corp STR (NYSE), Reuters.com #gas and oil exploration and production #midstream field services #interstate gas transportation #retail gas distribution In 2005, Knox Lawrence International acquired Consonus Inc., a Questar subsidiary which was formed 5 years ago and had housed and managed computer data centers for dozens of businesses. Questar Corp. was getting out of the data center management business. E&P; Business Spin-Off On July 1, 2010, Questar Market Resources (QMR) exploration and production business was spun off to form a new publicly traded company, QEP Resources, Inc. (). QEP established its company headquarters in Denver, Colo. Questar Corporation's board of directors elected Ron W. Jibson as president and CEO. On October 19, 2014 Tesoro Logistics LP agreed to buy QEP Resources Inc.‚Äôs natural-gas pipeline and processing business for $2.5 billion in cash to expand its business in the Rocky Mountains and North Dakota. Dominion Resources It was announced on February 1, 2016 that Dominion Resources, an energy company based in Richmond, Virginia, would be purchasing Questar Corporation for $25 a share (about $4.4 billion). On September 16, 2016 the Dominion Resources and Questar Corporation merger was officially completed. Dominion Questar becomes the official name for the Salt Lake City based subsidiary of Dominion Resources. Current CEO of Questar Corporation, Ron Jibson, is named to the board of directors at Dominion Resources following the completion of the merger.

For example, to find the seventh Fortunate number, one would first calculate the product of the first seven primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 and 17), which is 510510. Adding 2 to that gives another even number, while adding 3 would give another multiple of 3. One would similarly rule out the integers up to 18. Adding 19, however, gives 510529, which is prime. Hence 19 is a Fortunate number. The Fortunate number for pn# is always above pn and all its divisors are larger than pn. This is because pn#, and thus pn# + m, is divisible by the prime factors of m not larger than pn. The Fortunate numbers for the first primorials are: :3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 17, 19, 23, 37, 61, 67, 61, 71, 47, 107, 59, 61, 109, etc. .

From 2007 to 2012, the board was assisted by eight advisory committees. The Commission is not responsible to undertake service-delivery or advocacy for mental health services. The aim is provide relevant jurisdictions and stakeholders with tools and information required to improve the quality of and access to mental health care. The proposal for creation of the MHCC was made by the Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology in 2006 in their publication, \\"Out of the Shadows at Last,\\" a comprehensive study of the state of mental health care in Canada. Mandate of the Mental Health Commission of Canada The MHCC was tasked with three major objectives.: #To develop a national mental health strategy (until 2008, Canada was the only G8 nation that did not have one). #To oversee the development and implementation of an anti-stigma and anti-discrimination campaign. #To create a Knowledge Exchange Centre, with the aim of mobilizing evidence-based knowledge to improve best practices and increasing dialogue across Canada. In addition to the three initiatives stated above, a fourth initiative was added when the Commission entered into a five-year Health Canada funding agreement in 2008 to support five research demonstration projects on mental health and homelessness. Mental Health First Aid was added to the Commission in 2010. The MHCC does not provide clinical services, direct fiscal or human resources related to clinical practice, monitor government performance, or engage in advocacy with government bodies. It operates outside the federal/provincial/territorial constitutional framework, working at all jurisdictional levels. Former Advisory Committees From 2007 to 2012, the MHCC worked with eight committees, each having approximately 120 members with expertise and experience in a different field of mental health, in order to oversee their mandate. The committees were tasked with advising on the following major areas of concern: Child and Youth * The Evergreen Framework, a Canadian policy paper on mental health issues concerning children and youth. * Evidence-based mental health services for youth through schools. * The MHCC Youth Council Family Caregivers First Nations, Inuit and Metis Mental Health and the Law * assist in the development of best practices for law enforcement through the creation of The Police Project. * develop tools to study the impact of human rights on the mentally ill and their involvement with the law. Seniors * the creation of guidelines to support people involved in the care of seniors. * the drafting of the Seniors Mental Health Policy Lens Toolkit (SMPHL), a survey designed to assess the mental health of senior citizens. Service Systems * addressing issues surrounding peer support, immigrants, refugees, racially marginalized groups and housing. Science Workforce * advising on the writing of the National Standard of Canada for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace. Other Significant Projects and Initiatives At Home The Commission's \\"At Home\\" research project (\\"Chez Soi\\" in French) looked to address homelessness for people with mental illness by combining treatment with places to live, and is the largest experiment of its kind in the world. Taking place in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Moncton, the project is based on the Housing First model of the Pathways to Housing program in the United States, which has reported positive results in cities including New York, Philadelphia and Washington. In 2012, the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) is documenting the results of the At Home project with the interactive web documentary Here At Home. Fifty short documentaries about the experiences of participants in At Home are being added to the NFB website until the summer of 2013. Directors on the NFB project include Manfred Becker (Toronto), Lynne Stopkewich (Vancouver) and Louiselle No√´l (Moncton). The research portion of this project concluded in March 2013. Changing Directions, Changing Lives: The Mental Health Strategy for Canada On May 8, 2012, Canada became the last of the G8 nations to create a national mental health strategy. The document, \\"Changing Directions, Changing Lives: The Mental Health Strategy for Canada,\\" set out six strategic aims, including implementation, prevention, diversity, access and delivery of services. Opening Minds The Opening Minds initiative was launched in 2009 to combat stigma against mental illness. The Commission invited organizations across the country to submit applications for to be considered for inclusion in the program. Currently they work with 65 partners and 45 active projects. It was decided that the projects would focus on four target groups, namely: healthcare providers, youth (12-18), workforce, and media. Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace Standard On January 16, 2013, the MHCC announced the release of the Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace Standard. This framework was designed to be adapted by Canadian companies in assisting them to implement policies and practices aimed at combatting mental illness and identifying potential hazards to their employees. Partnership with the National Mental Health Commission of Australia In March 2013, the MHCC announced a partnership with the National Mental Health Commission of Australia. The two countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding and agreed to share knowledge on best practices for mental health research. Informing the Future: Mental Health Indicators for Canada MHCC initiated Informing the Future to paint a picture of mental health in Canada. These indicators provide information on the mental health status of children and youth, adults, and seniors, as well as show how the mental health care system responds to mental illness.

It is Quebec's oldest provincial park and its second largest after Kuururjuaq National Park. It takes its name from Mont-Tremblant. Several summer and winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, short and long hiking hut, canoe lake and river kayaking, mountain biking, backcountry camping and swimming in lakes, such as Lake Lauzon clear water. The park is managed by the Quebec government and its Soci√©t√© des √©tablissements de plein air du Qu√©bec (S√âPAQ). Geography Location Chute du Diable This park covers and is located in the northeast of Mont- Tremblant and extends east to the north of Saint-C√¥me. Its territory is located in the regional county municipality (MRC) of Les Laurentides, Antoine- Labelle and Matawinie. The park includes eight municipalities and three unorganized territories. It is bounded on the north by the Rouge-Matawin Wildlife Reserve (r√©serve faunique Rouge-Matawin) and on the east by the Zec Lavigne. The park is divided into three main areas, namely the valleys of the Diable River, the Pimbina Creek, and the Assomption River. The Diable sector is accessible by highway 15 and route 117 from Montreal; or by route 323 from Ottawa, Ontario. The Pimbina sector is accessible via route 125 from Saint- Donat. The Assomption sector is accessible through Saint-C√¥me. It is also possible to access to the park by La Macaza, by Labelle and by Saint-Michel- des-Saints. The park lies within the eastern forest-boreal transition ecoregion.  Climate  The climate of Mont-Tremblant park is characterized by moderately warm summers and cold winters. Precipitation is relatively abundant all year. Geology and soil science The entire park is located in Grenville Province, the most recent of the Canadian Shield geological provinces. The rock is composed of gneiss and granulites. The passage of Ice Age strongly influenced its territory rounded hilltops and valleys surcreusant. The glaciers also left a layer of till with variable size. There are sand deposits along the rivers and lakes. Organic deposits are rare and only found north of Lake Cypress and along some lakes.  Hydrography  Rivi√®re du Diable et chutes Croches dans le parc du Mont-Tremblant (Qu√©bec) The park is divided in three sub-watersheds, namely the Rouge (through the Diable River) of The Assumption and the Matawin. Streams and forms lakes are greatly influenced by the shortcomings of the Canadian Shield. There are over 400 lakes in the park, including the largest, Lake Cypress, is . Most lakes are located in the northern part of the park, the southern portion having a rugged landscape. The position of the park at the head of several watersheds ensures good water quality in streams. History The Algonquin called the mountain \\"Manitonga Soutana\\" (Mountain of Spirits or the Devil). They claimed that the mountain emitted rumblings and swayed under their feet. Logging began in the region in the 1850s. On January 12, 1895, Mont-Tremblant Park was created following the project to set up a sanatorium, which never saw the light of day. Unlike the \\"preservationist\\" vision that prevailed in United States and Canada, and that protected the park from exploitation, the province preferred a \\"conservationist\\" vision that promoted a reasonable use of the natural resources. That is why logging remained in the park until 1981. Having an original area of , the park was enlarged to in 1925. Lac Monroe dans le secteur de la Diable In 1938, an American named Joe Ryan established a ski resort on Mont-Tremblant mountain and changed provincial law to include the use of public park and place of recreation. A research station opened at Lake Monroe in 1948 and an initial public camping born at Lake Chat 1958, which marked the kickoff for the creation of several recreational facilities in the valleys of the Diable River and northern Saint-Donat. In 1961, the park changed its name to \\"Parc du Mont-Tremblant\\". In 1977, the province changed the philosophy of conservation and adopted the \\"Law on Parks\\". This new law precluded commercial and industrial exploitation of natural resources in the parks. The old parks were given priority and the park was granted the status of \\"recreation park\\" in 1981, with the exception of an area of which was included in park in 1990. The northern half of the park became in turn the Rouge-Matawin Wildlife Reserve (r√©serve faunique Rouge-Matawin). The government revived further consultations in 1998, which produced minor boundary changes and the change in status for \\"conservation park\\" in 2000. It became the \\"Mont-Tremblant National Park\\" after abandoning the status of recreation park by the province in 2001. Natural Heritage Wildlife There are 40 species of mammals in the park. The more easily observable are the moose, the deer, the eastern wolf, the red fox, the black bear, the hare, the red squirrel, the Canadian beaver, the muskrat, the river otter and the mink. Eleven of these species are likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable. The diversity of birds is much larger with 194 species, including 25 of warblers. Included are grouse, buntings, thrushes, nuthatches, woodpeckers and jays. It includes the great horned owl, the barred owl, the winged hawk and the osprey. The park is used as a staging area for the Canada goose. Of these species, only the bald eagle is considered vulnerable. The park also includes seven species of reptiles and fourteen species of amphibians, mostly associated with the aquatic environment. It contains, among others, the bullfrog, the green frog, the newt, the water snake, the wood turtle and the painted turtle. The wood turtle is listed as vulnerable in Quebec; and water snakes and pickerel frog are likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable. Finally, there are 29 species of fish in the park, the main species being the brook trout, which prefer oxygenated headwater lakes, and pike, which prefer warmer waters.  Wolf  The eastern wolf is a subspecies of wolf frequenting the park and the emblem of the park. It is estimated to have in the park four or five packs and a population of 35 individuals. The park wolves mainly hunt beaver, moose and deer, which constitute the major part of their diet. Flora Fall foliage at Mont Tremblant The park is part of the climax area of sugarbush to yellow birch. The tops of the hills and the valley Macaza, on the north, have the start of the range of fir yellow birch. The \\"Carcan\\" (Straitjacket) and Mount Tremblant has meanwhile a succession of forest land from the sugar maple to balsam fir. Beautiful colors of the fall season at Mont Tremblant. The main tree species are the sugar maple, the red maple, the yellow birch, the white birch, the beech, the aspen, the balsam fir, the white spruce, the red spruce and the black spruce. It also includes individuals of hemlock, basswood and red oak which are at the northern limit of their distribution areas. The park has 9 plants likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable, most of them located in the Lake Monroe. With the exception of Hieracium robinsonii and Listeria australis, watching other plants back 40 years and requires an update.

History In 1822, the Mandan tribe built a settlement with earth-covered lodges on the bluffs of the Missouri River. In 1830, a representative of the American Fur Company built Fort Clark Trading Post south of the village. The first steamboat to journey up the upper-Missouri River was the Yellowstone which arrived in 1832 carrying 1,500 gallons of goods and liquor. George Catlin visited in 1832, and Karl Bodmer, and Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied stayed the winter of 1833-1834.

It depicts the relative size of everything in the universe in an 8-minute sequence using animation and animation camera shots. Synopsis The film starts with an aerial image of a boy rowing with his dog in a boat on the Ottawa River. The movement then freezes and the view slowly zooms out, revealing more of the landscape all the time. The continuous zoom-out takes the viewer on a journey from Earth, past the Moon, the planets of the Solar System, the Milky Way and out into the far reaches of the known universe. The process is then reversed, and the view zooms back through space to Earth, returning to the boy on the boat. It then zooms in to the back of the boy's hand, where a mosquito is resting. It zooms into the insect's proboscis and on into the microscopic world, concluding at the level of an atomic nucleus. It then zooms back out to the original view of the boy on the boat. Inspiration and follow ups The film was based on the 1957 essay \\"Cosmic View\\" by Kees Boeke. The 1968 short film Powers of Ten (updated in 1977) used the same idea and techniques, as did the 1996 IMAX film Cosmic Voyage. Release Cosmic Zoom was one of seven NFB animated shorts acquired by the American Broadcasting Company, marking the first time NFB films had been sold to a major American television network.

In 1252, together with Faris ad-Din Aktai al-Mostareb, he suppressed a major rebellion led by al-Sharif Hesn ad-Din Thalab (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿ±ŸäŸÅ ÿ≠ÿµŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿ´ÿπŸÑÿ®) in Middle and Upper Egypt. Feeling that Aktai and his Mamluks were defying his authority and almost installed a state within his state, Aybak decided to kill him. In a conspiracy involving Aybak, Qutuz and some other Mamluks, Aktai was murdered in the sultan's fort and his Mamluks, including his friend Baibars al-Bunduqdari, fled to Syria and al-Karak.

Transport infrastructure in the states of the Arab League has been growing, albeit slowly. Highways Regional highways Highways and Roads in the States of the Arab League There are several cross-Arab State roads, crossing the Arab world from its farthest point in the west in Mauritania, to its eastern farthest point in Oman. The Arab States are connected with roads and highways that cross deserts, mountains and forests. The most developed state with high road infrastructure is the United Arab Emirates, followed by Syria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt, while countries such as Sudan, Libya, Mauritania, Somalia and Yemen seem to have a lot of building to do. Railways Rail Lines in the Arab League Egypt has by far the oldest railroad in the Middle East and Africa and one of the oldest in the world, built in 1854 by Khedive Abbas I of Egypt. Now Egypt has the most extensive railway system in the Middle East, and is the only country in the Arab League to have an underground metro system in Cairo. The Souk Ahras‚ÄìGhardimaou line already connect Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia with each other, but Morocco and Algeria have closed the line due to increased tensions. while Libya, Egypt and Sudan are not connected to each other. In the Asian part, almost all Arab states have been connected by railroads, except the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Perhaps the most developed railways connecting Arab states can be found between Iraq and Syria, with the Iraqi Republic Railways which run through Syria to Turkey. New projects underway to develop the Arab rail lines have been under construction, linking the south Egyptian city of Abu Simbel with the north Sudanese city of Wadi Halfa.

They played their last show under the former name with Lost Valentinos at the Sydney Club The Annandale on 18 May 2007. Ghostwood's first release is their eponymous EP, with tracks Red Version, Blue Version, Ghost, Run and Pencils. The single Red Version was iTunes single of the week in late August 2007. Some say that all the songs on the EP are about Pok√©mon, as emphasised by the titles, all of which except Pencils reference the video game series. Gabby (Vocalist and songwriter for the band) has stated in an interview that the song Red Version is about the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game, but Blue Version is not. Throughout 2011 Ghostwood have had high rotation Radio play on Australia's triple j with new songs \\" Sunset Mirage\\" & \\" Cutlass\\", the first of new tracks to be released along with the 3rd & EP titled track \\" I am Overcast\\" in June 2011.

The second album featuring the hit single \\"XXX\\" was recorded at Progressive Music in Tampa. These recordings helped to get the band signed with heavy metal label Metal Blade Records. After releasing four albums between 1985 and 1989 they broke up. After there had been speculation about a reunion for some time, an album of new material was released in the spring of 2004. Since then, the band has played occasional live shows. In January 2016, it was reported that Nasty Savage was planning to record a new album in the summer of that year.

It was published by Wildstorm (DC Comics) and Dynamite Entertainment. Based on the original Freddy vs. Jason 2 film treatment by Jeff Katz, the story serves as a sequel to Freddy vs. Jason and the Evil Dead trilogy. The comic book series was written by James Kuhoric and illustrated by Jason Craig. Plot summary Set in December 2008, 5 years after the events of the film Freddy vs. Jason and 16 years after the end of Army of Darkness, the story begins with Will Rollins and Lori Campbell (the former protagonists from Freddy vs. Jason) returning to Crystal Lake to put closure to their experience, but Jason kills them a short while after and takes their decomposed corpses to his shack in the woods nearby. There, Jason enters a trance, and Freddy and Jason's \\"mother\\" appear to him. Freddy Krueger is now trapped, powerless inside the mind of Jason Voorhees, where he learns of the Necronomicon hidden in the old Voorhees home, with the power to resurrect him. He and Jason's mother (false Pamela Voorhees) convince Jason that if he gets the Necronomicon, Jason will become \\"a real boy\\". Meanwhile, Ash Williams is called to the new Crystal Lake S-Mart to give his retail expertise to its team of teenage slacker employees. While there, he interprets a nearby Jason murder as work of the Deadites. Later, he follows a group of teens to the Voorhees house where he finds the Necronomicon before Jason appears, killing the teens. At the S-Mart, Ash and the employees begin to make a plan to deal with Jason; however, he ends up killing mostly everyone in the store and escaping with the evil book. Freddy uses the Necronomicon to restore himself to full power and increase Jason's intelligence. Later when Ash and the survivors sleep, they are confronted by Freddy in their dreams. Ash and his motley crew of S-Mart employees confront Freddy and Jason at the Voorhees home where Freddy has already unleashed the full power of the Necronomicon, giving him reality-altering power. In a final confrontation between the three horror movie icons, Freddy resurrects all of Jason's previous victims from the Friday the 13th films as Deadites after Jason turns on him, and turns the Voorhees home into the Elm Street house. Ultimately, Ash uses the Necronomicon to open a portal, banishing Freddy to the Deadite world, while Jason and the Necronomicon are isolated underneath a frozen Crystal Lake. Collected editions The series is collected as a trade paperback: *Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash (144 pages, Wildstorm, September 2008) Sequel In August 2009, the first issue of Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors, another six issue mini-series, was released with James Kuhoric and Jason Craig returning to write and illustrate, respectively. The story picks up where Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash left off and features cameos from known characters from the previous Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street films.Back to Crystal Lake with Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash 2, Newsarama, March 18, 2009 Cancelled film adaptation Following the box office success and ambiguous ending of the cross over slasher film Freddy vs Jason (2003), plans were being made for a follow up film based on the storyline of the comic sequel which delved into the concept of including Ash Williams of the Evil Dead horror franchise and recurring characters from both the A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th franchise. However, following creative differences between New Line Cinema and Bruce Campbell the film was scrapped.

The B&A; commissioned buildings from H.H. Richardson for three new stops at Boylston Street, Beacon Street, and Washington Street (later called Woodland) in October 1884. The three stations were built in largely unoccupied areas of Newton, and the attractive architecture was intended to bring in new residents who would become paying customers of the railroad. By this time, Richardson was in failing health; his successors Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge may have done most of the design work. Construction by the Norcross Brothers firm began in June 1886‚Äîtwo months after Richardson's death‚Äîand finished that September. Similar to the other stations on the line, it was built in the heavy stone Richardsonian Romanesque style with a dominant roofline. The corners facing the tracks were cut back to serve as porches. Conversion to trolley service A 548-space parking garage opened in 2006 In June 1957, the Massachusetts Legislature approved the purchase of the branch by the M.T.A. from the nearly-bankrupt New York Central Railroad for conversion to a trolley line. Service ended on May 31, 1958. The line was quickly converted for trolley service, with bare platforms and small shelters at each station. The new Woodland station was built somewhat to the east of the original station, as the latter was surrounded by a golf course with no room for a parking lot. Because of this, the station building was not torn down like most on the line were. The branch reopened with trolley service on July 4, 1959. The M.T.A. was folded into the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in August 1964. Woodland is one of only four of Richardson's B&A; stations, and the only one of his Newton Circuit stations, to survive past the 1960s. It was added to the Newton Railroad Stations Historic District in 1976, but has fallen into disrepair. It sits on the grounds of the Woodland Golf Club, which uses it as a storage space. In October 1997, Woodland was identified as a possible site for a parking garage to replace its 450-space surface lot. After numerous delays, the MBTA signed a ground lease agreement with a private developer in 2004. Under the terms of the agreement, the developer paid for the construction of a 548-space parking garage, accessible platforms, and entrance road to the station in exchange for rights to construct a transit-oriented development with rental apartments on the former parking lot. The new platforms and garage opened in March 2006; the Arborpoint at Woodland Station development broke ground in April 2006 and opened in October 2007.

Formed in 2002, the band released their first album, Geworden Spunker! ('Get Spunked!') in 2005. Gerspunken's combination of classical instrumentals and themes into their tracks (The band's front-man and bassist Bruno Speltervasser and lead guitarist Hans Burstein met whilst studying at the Konservatorium Wien, Vienna's Conservatorium of Music, in 2001) is unique in the glam genre. This facet of their composition has attracted mixed criticism,Harpen, Dan, Bad Alchemy, \\"Taking Punk Head-On\\", Issue 51 July 2006 as has their utilization of electronic music generation.  Origins  The group's origins can be traced to the time Speltervasser and Burstein spent at the Konservatorium Wien in 2001. The duo were familiar with each other from their youth in the Tyrolean town of Mayrhofen, and had worked together for a short period at the Peter Habeler Mountaineering Academy during the summer of 2000. Burstein, born in Poland, moved to Austria when he was seven. The pair were accomplished young musicians at this point but played exclusively in the classical genre, Burstein as a flautist and Speltervasser playing Violin and Viola for the Tyrolean Youth Orchestra. Burstein took up a position at the Konservatorium in late 2000 at the suggestion of his parents, and Speltervasser joined his friend at the institution the following year. Konservatorium Incident During 2002 the duo caused considerable drama at the Conservatorium, which Speltervasser accounted to his disenchantment with the rigid and uncreative structures of the institution. Immediately before the annual enrollment, Burstein changed his name by deed-poll from Hans Rinehold Burstein to Megatr√∂n, with the specific intention of irritating the college staff who by law were forced to print the Annual Vienna Orchestral Roll with Burstein's new legal name. When asked by the Konservatorium's Dean about the deed-poll incident, Burstein claimed that he had been \\"..inspired by Megatron's example of fortitude and leadership in the quest of the Decepticons for the Creation Matrix,\\" and that the gratuitous heavy metal umlaut was the \\"sign of the beast.\\"Burstein, H., Interview with Greysteins, D of http://www.metal-planet.com Oct 2005 When the Konservatorium demanded that he change the registered name, Burstein refused and consulted a friend engaged in legal studies and successfully petitioned the authorities to allow him to register his new legal name in the Tutonic Blackletter of the M√∂tley Cr√ºe Logo, thus becoming the only person in Austrian history to have legal name in a specific font. After his expulsion from the Konservatorium, Burstein changed his name back to that of his birth. Disenchanted with the classical establishment, the duo resigned from their courses in 2002, joining with fellow Mayrhofen local Karl Steiner, then living in Vienna playing drums for a local band, and Munich guitarist and singer Reinhold Mayer. During the summer of 2002 the band played in many venues throughout Vienna and at Tyrol, and were the resident act at the Blue Tomato Nightclub on Johnstrasse in Vienna.  Geworden Spunker!  Poster from gerspunken's 2006 \\"Geworden Spunker!\\" tour In early 2005 the group released their first album, on which they had worked throughout the previous year at their self-titled ‚ÄúSpunkStudio‚Äù in Mayrhofen. ‚ÄúGeworden Spunker!‚Äù ('Get Spunked!') was touted by Ablaze Magazine as ‚Äú‚Ä¶the heaviest offering from any band in Germany or Austria in 2005. How can these guys still hear?‚ÄùCalvin Messner, http://www.ablaze-magazine.de/, 27/5/05 ‚ÄúGeworden Spunker!‚Äù met with mixed reviews, however. Das RuhrMetal.de, an online Punk e-zine from the Ruhr region, claimed ‚Äú‚Ä¶this cacophony is fit only for the fire. These young men seem set on single-handedly destroying an entire genre.‚ÄùG. J. Lloyd, http://www.ruhrmetal.rockt.de/, 3/6/05  Delphinj√§ger  Track 2 on this album, entitled Delphinj√§ger, (Dolphin Hunter) incited rage among Austria's Green community. ‚ÄúWe believe this to be an astonishing insult to such a precious species,‚ÄùSheen, M, www.greenpeace.te, 12/2/06 said Greenpeace CCE spokeswoman Marie Sheen. The line from the chorus ‚ÄúBumsen Sie jene faulen grauen Fische, essen Sie sie alle,‚Äù (‚ÄúFuck those lazy grey fish, lets have some dinner,‚Äù) was particularly contentious. During the 2006 Australia/New Zealand tour, Burstein was asked on an interview with Richard James of Fbi 94.5fm about the issue. ‚ÄúI had a traumatic experience with a dolphin once,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWhen I was twelve, I was swimming with my male nurse Sven on a family holiday at Hossegor, and what you could call a freak dolphin incident occurred.‚ÄùBurstein, H, in an interview with Richard James of Sydney's Fbi 94.5 in February 2006  New Album  In October 2007 Gerspunken announced the release of their long-awaited second studio album, entitled \\"Hassen Sie Nicht Freiheit!\\" (\\"Don't Hate Freedom!\\".) In a press conference in Mayrhofen, Speltervasser explained the new direction the group's creative process had taken during their time working on \\"Hassen sie nicht Freiheit!\\" \\"We are a much tighter unit now, much, much tighter,\\" Speltervasser explained to Carmen Tomachich of German punk E-zine SOUND.de.Speltervasser, B, in an interview with Tomachich, C of www.sound.de in October 2007 \\"The creative juices are flowing in the \\"SpunkStudio\\" and we're all getting in on the act together, instead of just me and Hans like it used to be. Even Arnold is involved, and his wife Sara also comes sometimes as well. It's a much bigger process now.\\" The album's cover has, like much of Gerspunken's art and music, attracted considerable negative criticism.  Single Release  The first single from the \\"Don't Hate Freedom\\" album was released in the March 2008 amidst a storm of controversy. Rockster Records, the band's label, refused to carry the Single if included the track \\"Real Men Fuck Women\\" which the band refused to drop from the record. Without the support of Rockster the band released the disk under their own label with \\"Real Men Fuck Women\\" as the title track.  Relocation Overseas  In the Spring of 2013 the band re- located permanently to Sydney, Australia, with a new stripped-back lineup consisting of Spelterwasser on bass and vocals, Burstein on guitar, and Steiner on drums. By 2014 the group had brought Steiner's Italian half-sister, Gertrude, on board as the lead vocalist, leaving Speltervasser unencumbered to work on the bass-lines which had, up to this point, been \\"...the weakest fish at the bottom of a barrel of other slightly less weak fish.\\"Burstein, H, http://www.gerspunken.de/ The group had spent considerable time in Sydney and Melbourne over the past years and explained that the move was driven primarily by lifestyle factors and an emerging alternative culture in Australia. In September the group announced that they had almost completed a new EP, entitled \\"Hard Love Machine,\\" and would gig the new record in the Australian summer.

He was born in Bogo, Cebu, Philippines. As a young man, Umpad was exposed to the traditional Filipino martial arts of Eskrima; in his region the term ‚Äúestocada‚Äù was also used to describe these arts. Umpad gave full credit to the Balintawak Eskrima and Doce Pares systems, which made up much of his early training. When he went to the United States, he continued his training with Master Raymond Tobosa in the art of Villabrille Kali. In the United States Umpad settled in Northern California where he became acquainted with various masters from Stockton and the San Francisco Bay Area such as Angel Cabales, Leo Giron, Max Pallen, and Gilbert Tenio. Visayan Style Corto Kadena Umpad created his own style in the late 1970s, called Visayan Style Corto Kadena / Larga Mano Eskrima. The style emphasizes dance- like flowing movements, speed, elusiveness and explosive power. The art is based on the blade, although sticks, empty hands and kicks are also used. Umpad evolved his style through systematic study and analysis of various aspects of the Filipino martial arts. Thus there are certain phases that track Umpad's research, which he synthesized into his own unique contribution to the art. Some of this progression can be seen in different generations of students, as Umpad himself was always evolving. Umpad's early format focused on doblecada, use of double sticks, where he began to attract attention. His insights on leverage allowed Umpad, a slight man, to hit with speed and power from any angle. He became known for his centerline roll, which incorporated Wing Chun's straight punch principle into a simple and unique method of double sticks that is ‚Äúlive‚Äù, meaning it does not rely on set patterns or left/right hand matchups to be effective. As students progressed, they moved from stick to blade, intensifying their training. Umpad worked during the late 1980s and early 1990s to define his sikaran, a Filipino style of kicking integrated for use with weaponry. While his weapon and hand techniques draw strongly on Visayan styles, Umpad's footwork was heavily influenced by Moros from neighboring Mindanao, using low stances and cross steps to control range and angles. Low kicks attack and defend in conjunction with the weapon above and aim to cripple by hitting lowline targets such as joints. During his later years Umpad focused his training and teaching most strongly on the blade, both sword and knife. The evasiveness of bladework refined the larga mano part of the art, which in turn contributed to working with cane and staff. Any of these can be used to transition fluidly from long to short range and back. Teaching Umpad was a reclusive man who taught small groups of students in his living room in order to devote sufficient attention to each student's progress. Umpad occasionally taught seminars with his business partner, Sifu Jesse Glover. Glover, the first student of Bruce Lee, referred to Umpad as ‚ÄúBruce Lee with a stick‚Äù because of the speed and economy of his movement. Umpad was chosen as the model to portray Bruce for making the Bruce Lee video game. Many of Umpad's students in the Bay Area and Washington state came from backgrounds in Jun Fan/JKD, Kajukenbo and Wing Chun, as well as other Filipino styles. In his last years Umpad made trips to Europe to teach at exhibitions in Switzerland and Germany, where he impressed people with his style. As a result of the exposure he got later in his career, Umpad developed qualified teachers to spread his art into Switzerland and Germany as well as in California and Washington state. Weapons In conjunction with his martial art, Umpad was a craftsman, hand making many artist-grade weapons for students and friends. He was among the first to create light, viable padded sticks for training, coming up with not one but several designs. Other creations included knives, swords, spears, axes, whips and more, often made from common materials, based on both traditional and street weapons of the Philippines. Some of his students continue this tradition as well, designing and making weapons for use in training. Umpad was keen to use modern technology. From early days he videotaped students‚Äô classes, creating an archival history documenting his art. Additionally, he and a few of his past and current students were interviewed and filmed in 2006 for a video produced by the Dog Brothers, The Grandfathers Speak Vol. 2, Maestro Sonny Umpad. Death Umpad died at home from cancer on August 24, 2006, at the age of 58. He was able in his last few months to see different generations of his students come together as a community which is dedicated to propagating his art. Sonny Umpad's Legacy Over the course of 30 years Sonny Umpad trained many people in the art of eskrima. His students stand as a testament to his commitment to passing on the art of Visayan Style, corto kadena/larga mano eskrima. Sonny promoted a number of these students to the rank of guro (teacher). The curriculum taught by these individuals will vary depending upon the era the student trained in (early, middle or late). The early era concentrating in more traditional eskrima drills and training, the middle and late eras focused on Sonny's many innovations.

As a player, he played professionally as a Canadian football slotback who played his entire nine career with the Alouettes where he was part of two Grey Cup champion teams. He played college football at Eastern Michigan University. Early life Deslauriers was born in Gatineau, Quebec, and attended Champlain College in Sherbrooke in the 2000‚Äì01 season. He became the starting quarterback for the Cougar team upon his arrival.

College career In 2002, Deslauriers received a full football scholarship from the NCAA's Division 1 Mid-American Conference's Eastern Michigan University. After playing the quarterback position all of his life, the Eagles' coaching staff decided to tap into Deslauriers' natural athletic abilities, (6'4 215 lbs), and switched him to the wide receiver position because of a surplus of quarterbacks on the team. After sitting out the 2002 season as a redshirt, Deslauriers finally arrived as a force to be reckoned with in the 2004 season. Deslauriers had 84 receptions that year for 1,257 yards and an EMU-record 13 touchdown receptions, all while being named the team MVP that year. Deslauriers completed his Communications major at EMU.

Professional career After trying out for the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League, Deslauriers signed a 4-year contract with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He was Montreal's 7th overall draft pick in the 2006 CFL Draft. In his first year with limited playing time in 2007, he had 23 receptions for 325 yards and one touchdown. He finished his career having played in 115 regular season games, recording 99 receptions for 1,334 yards and three touchdowns. Administrative career Deslauriers retired as a player in February 2016 but stayed with the Alouettes as a football operations assistant and scout.

As the next games relied on multiple characters, Kiryu took a smaller role in these games. However, the installment Yakuza 6: The Song of Life was meant to conclude Kiryu's role in the franchise. Several have praised how Kiryu, despite identifying as a yakuza, stood out because of his kindness and character development across the series' story. On the other hand, he has also been viewed as a somewhat typical gaming protagonist. Critical reception to Kiryu has been generally positive, and he is often considered a PlayStation mascot. Creation and development Writer Toshihiro Nagoshi created Kazuma Kiryu with Hasei Seishu's aid. In creating Kazuma Kiryu, there were some issues regarding how realistic his position and age were. Writer Hasei Seishu told the staff the positions were too high for his age and thus Kiryu's age was revised. When describing Kiryu, the staff found his position would be of the noble samurai type who would often protect others. According to Sega producer Toshihiro Nagoshi, dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character. Although Kiryu is the player character for Yakuza, Nagoshi refrained from calling him the protagonist as the narrative was focused on the character Haruka Sawamura who has a character arc instead in the game. The same basis was used for Yakuza 2 where the narrative focuses more on the new character Kaoru Sayama rather than Kiryu. When the spin-off Yakuza Kenzan was released, he commented that the tale of Kazuma Kiryu had yet to be completed. As a result, he had Kiryu and Haruka trying to live a \\"more 'human' life\\" throughout Yakuza 3. For this game Toshihiro Nagoshi stated Kiryu was highly different from an iconic hero as a result of the way he enjoys his life. Furthermore, Nagoshi said this difference is shown across the series. Nagoshi thanked staff member Yokoyama that the team could further develop Kiryu's appeal across the franchise. The inclusion of Kiryu running an orphanage for Yakuza 3 was enjoyed by Yokoyama despite rewriting this subplot multiple times. Originally, Kiryu was meant to go to prison once again but because it was going to be obvious they changed his story in this game. Due to Kiryu taking care of the orphans, Yokoyama feared the character became too kind. Across all these games, the development team developed a sturdy understanding of his personality, and there was a lot of effort put into making the character attractive to the audiences as a result of being the only playable character. By Yakuza 4, Kiryu was seen as \\"indestructible\\" by the staff, and as a result, he was made the last character playable in the game, following three new characters that stood out thanks to their different traits. In localizing the games, the character was often referred to by his first name, but by Yakuza 4, producer Yasuhiro Noguchi made him most commonly called Kiryu in an attempt to make him fit with the other main characters also called by their last names. For Yakuza 5, while once again there were other protagonists alongside Kiryu, a new one, Haruka, was added as playable for the first time in order to make her character arc connect with the role of Kiryu and the other characters. Kiryu was made into a taxi driver but in a new city where he is not known by other people by the staff as they thought it would be the best choice for him. For the prequel Yakuza 0 Sega wanted to make Majima stand out from the Kiryu as in this title the two share the role of protagonists. Sega described Kiryu as a \\"straight man trait ‚Äì tough but honorable and keeps to himself a bit\\" implying there are not too many difficulties in writing him. Through this game and the remake of the first game, Kiwami, the relationship between Kiryu and Majima becomes more explored in contrast to the initial game of the franchise, most notably because of the changes made to Majima's characterization and the way he sees Kiryu's actions while being both friends and enemies at the same time. Yakuza 0 also served as a story of Kiryu that Sega wanted players to know before reaching Yakuza 6. Kiryu's traits in Yakuza 0 were specifically changed to a \\"loose-cannon hot-head\\" to the point long time fans would be surprised by his actions. However, chief Masayoshi Yokoyama stated the character would mature across the storyline. Despite Kiryu's fame, Sato noted that players ended up enjoying Majima far more in the franchise. During development of Yakuza 4, the staff started wondering how would they end Kiryu's story as, unlike other video game characters, he did not possess supernatural powers. They compared the character with James Bond whose actor changed multiple times across his movies. Describing him as \\"a super-cool and masculine guy, but since he's a well-established character with a specific personality, there are things that he would and wouldn't do\\" the team decided he would need a successor who would bring the staff more creativity to work with. In late 2016, Nagoshi claimed he had been doing Kazuma's story for nearly a decade, stating \\"it had its pros and cons\\". He concluded saying \\"I also think that's a way to give back to Kazuma Kiryu. Sooner or later, I want to announce something different.\\" In April 2017 Sega confirmed that while Yakuza 6 will end Kiryu's story, the series will still go on. Deciding to bring the last tale Kiryu with Yakuza 6, the staff wanted to do the game as appealing as possible. The game focuses on the family relationship between Kiryu and Haruka after years of being separated. Voice actors English voice actor Darryl Kurylo said that he wanted to sound as good as possible after being impressed by the characterization of Kiryu and the lines he had to give. However, he regrets some lines were lost in translation of the original game. Nevertheless, Kurylo enjoyed the experience to the point of playing the game multiple times alongside his son. In order to fit the lipsyncing from the original Japanese game, Kurylo often had to say a line in different styles. Kurylo still found more fun when doing the yells for the fight scenes. Nogashi was impressed by Kiryu's Japanese voice actor, Takaya Kuroda, due to how he sang in the music minigame. Another staff member, Sato, was impressed by the karaoke game as it helped to show a fun side of Kiryu. Kuroda highly enjoyed voicing his character, being anxious in most scenes regardless of the tone he had to make. As a result, he wants to keep Kiryu in character. Kuroda describes Kiryu as a true shy character, stating he does not consider himself too attractive to the point he could not form a formal romantic relationship with Sayama in Yakuza 2. Kuroda was surprised with the success of the first Yakuza game and thus hoped the series would continue. Kuroda expressed joy with his work as he recalls people who distinguished his voice from the games. Appearances Yakuza Kiryu is a famous member of the Tojo clan, who earned the nickname of \\"the Dragon of Dojima\\". Early in the first game he was planning on starting his own subsidiary group until he takes the blame for the murder of his boss, Sohei Dojima, to protect his best friend, Akira Nishikiyama, and is imprisoned for ten years. After his release, Kiryu returns to his home town, Kamurocho, but due to his patricide he is marked for death by the entire yakuza community. Kiryu then learns that 10 billion yen has been stolen from the Tojo Clan. Soon after he meets a young girl called Haruka, whom seemingly every criminal group in the country is after. With help of detective Date, Kiryu manages to learn the truth of the money. Upon reuniting with Yumi, his childhood love and Haruka's mother he is confronted by Kyohei Jingu, Haruka's father, and the true owner of the money. After defeating Jingu, Kiryu is reunited with his old friend Nishiki. The two fight, with Kiryu coming out victorious. Jingu tries to shoot Kiryu but Yumi takes the bullet for him. Nishikiyama then kills himself with Jingu. After Yumi dies in Kiryu's arms, Kiryu subsequently decides to start a new, honest life with Haruka. Yakuza 2 In Yakuza 2, the fifth Chairman of the Tojo Clan, Yukio Terada, is assassinated and Kazuma Kiryu wants Sohei Dojima's son Daigo to take the clan's leadership and prevent an upcoming yakuza families war. While attempting to broker a peace deal between the Tojo and the Omi, Daigo and Jin Goda, Omi chairman, are kidnapped by Ryuji Goda, Jin's adopted son. Ryuji, through working with the Jingweon mafia, attempts to destroy Kamurocho and Kiryu to be the only dragon in Japan. Kiryu is put under the protective custody of a female detective called Kaoru Sayama, who uses him to get close to the Tojo to discover her past. Eventually, Kiryu and Ryuji fight atop Kamurocho Hills. Kiryu is victorious, but Yukio Terada appears, revealing that he faked his own death to start a war and is really a Jingweon survivor. Terada is also defeated, but begs Kiryu to trust him. After Jin Goda, Takashima and Terada are dead, Kiryu and Ryuji have a final showdown, which Kiryu wins. A bomb Terada had triggered, but secretly removed the fuse from, fails to detonate, saving Kiryu and Kaoru's lives. Yakuza 3 For Yakuza 3 Kiryu leaves Kamurocho for Okinawa, where he now runs the Orphanage. There he raises nine children, including Haruka. As time passes, Kiryu befriends the Ryudo Family from Okinawa despite initial conflicts over the Morning Glory's ownership. Kiryu is caught up in a government plot when Morning Glory's land is in the way of a proposed resort. Daigo is shot and falls into a coma; Nakahara is also attacked, and the deed to the orphanage is stolen. The brother of the late Shintaro Kazama. Date gives him information on the three most likely suspects for Kashiwagi's death: Yoshitaka Mine, a white collar yakuza, Goh Hamazaki, a patriarch with ties to the triads, and Tsuyoshi Kanda, who has taken over the gang once controlled by Kiryu's sworn brother, Nishikiyama. The Military Base Expansion Bill is actually part of a CIA operation to eliminate a group of arms smugglers known as Black Monday, and the mystery assassin is Joji Kazama, Shintaro's younger brother who works for the CIA's Japanese division. In return for his help, Tamiya asks Kiryu to protect Toma, his former secretary, from a planned hit by Joji. Kiryu fights through his men to reach the Daigo's hospital room, where he meets CIA operative Andre Richardson. Richardson explains that he has been using Mine as a way to gain access to what he believes to be an advanced missile defense system, unaware that it does not exist. Nevertheless, he prepares to finish off Kiryu. Daigo, having woken up from his coma, suddenly shoots him through the chest before Mine, in an act of self-sacrifice, throws himself and Richardson off the roof to their deaths. Yakuza 4 During Yakuza 4, Kiryu continues to run the orphanage. There, Haruka and him nurse a wounded prisoner, Taiga Saejima, washed ashore one day. Kiryu provides for him, allowing Saejima to return to the district upon his recovery. Some time after Saejima leaves, Hamazaki washes ashore, warning Kiryu of a threat to the Tojo clan. Kiryu leaves and meets Saeijima's sister, Yasuko, in their journey to Kamurocho to find his brother. There Kiryu witnesses Goro Majima being arrested and dragged away from Millennium Tower to police patrol cars. He chases her into the sewers, where Tanimura and Akiyama mistake him for an Ueno Seiwa Clan member, and attack. After defeating them Kiryu chases Yasuko to the roof, where he finds her and Saejima bound and gagged by Katsuragi. During the events that follow Yasuko is shot and kills Katsuragi before dying herself. Kiryu later fights Daigo Dojima on top of the Millennium Tower who was seeking money stolen for the clan. Following his defeat, Kiryu welcomes Saejima to the Tojo clan back. Yakuza 5 In Yakuza 5, Kiryu has left the orphanage in Okinawa and becomes a taxi driver in Fukuoka under a false identity: . When it is revealed that Daigo Dojima has gone missing, the truce between Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance leads to a potential war. Kazuhiko Serizawa, an Osakan detective with the Organized Crimes Unit, warns Kiryu that he needs to meet with Omi Alliance Lieutenant Masaru Watase to prevent the war. Kiryu proposes he take on Aoyama‚Äôs forces by himself to minimize bloodshed and is victorious. Before Aoyama can reveal his master‚Äôs identity, he‚Äôs shot in the head by Morinaga, who is part of the conspiracy. In Kamurocho, Kiryu learns of how the current war will affect the debut of Haruka's performance as an idol. At the Tojo Clan Headquarters, Kiryu learns that Aizawa is Kurosawa‚Äôs son. Kurosawa wanted to leave Aizawa the entirety of the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance as a legacy, but Aizawa is only interested in defeating Kiryu. A wounded Kiryu defeats Aizawa and reunites with Haruka. Yakuza 0 Seventeen years prior to the events of the first game, Kiryu is framed for killing a civilian during a routine debt collection and must find the true killer before his family is forced to take responsibility on his behalf. While he attempts to uncover the mysteries behind the murder, he becomes entangled in a ruthless real estate war. Kiryu defeats Oda who aimed to kill Makoto Makimura, Tachibana's biological sister. Kiryu and Makoto are forced to leave Oda behind as they return to Kamurocho, and Oda is killed by Shibusawa for failing to deliver Makoto to him as promised. Upon returning to Kamurocho, Kiryu meets up with Tachibana and prepares to take him to see Makoto. However, Kiryu is wounded when reaching Tachibana who ends up getting killed by Lao Gui, a Chinese assassin who was hired by Dojima to set up the Empty Lot murder and frame Kiryu. Kiryu confronts Shibusawa and duels against him, and emerges victorious. After Makoto's case is solved, Kiryu returns to the Tojo clan and meets Majima for the first time. Yakuza 6: The Song of Life In Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Kiryu is imprisoned for three years. Once free, he learns Haruka is involved in a mysterious hit-and-run. Furthermore, Kiryu learns she is now a mother of an infant named Haruto and decides to take care of him until Haruka recovers from her coma. Finding out who is responsible takes Kiryu reluctantly back into the extra-judicial underbelly of Japan ‚Äî Kamurocho, as well as a small fishing town near Hiroshima called Onomichi. There, Kiryu befriends the Yomei Alliance's Hirose family who know of Haruka but do not know of Haruto. During Kiryu's investigation, he learns that elements of the Tojo and Yomei Alliance have been secretly manipulating events behind the scenes in order to maintain \\"The Secret of Onimichi\\". Haruka's hit- and-run incident is later to be revealed as part of a retaliatory attack against the Yomei Alliance by the Kamurocho-based Saio Triad. Kiryu returns to Kamurocho with the Hirose's Tsuyoshi Nagumo and Yuta Usami, learning the child's father is a former member who hit Haruka. However, they find him dead and Hirose reveals that Yuta is the actual father, something he kept in secret due to him being the heir of the Saio Triad. Kiryu makes peace with Yuta but Hirose tries to kill him when revealing the secret of Onomichi, a hidden battle ship made since World War II. Tojo Clan advisor Katsumi Sugai and Yomei Alliance leader Tsuneo Iwami reveal themselves to be the masterminds behind the conflict, and in an attempt to halt Kiryu's interference, kidnap Haruka and Haruto. Kiryu's allies save him but receives multiple gun shot when protecting Yuta. Kiryu fakes his death to hide Onomichi's secret and thus make Haruka, Yuta and Haruto start a life in the orphanage. Yakuza: Like a Dragon While not its main protagonist, Kiryu is scheduled to appear in the upcoming Yakuza: Like a Dragon. Spinoffs and other appearances Masakatsu Funaki portrays Kiryu in the first film of the series. During the events of the zombie spinoff Yakuza: Dead Souls, he returns to Kamurocho after Haruka is kidnapped by a mysterious man. Kiryu's avatar is also used in Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Kenzan! for the samurai Miyamoto Musashi. In Ry≈´ ga Gotoku Ishin!, Kiryu's avatar is once again used by a samurai, Sakamoto Ry≈çma. In the film adaptation Like a Dragon: Prologue, he is portrayed by Masakatsu Funaki. This film serves as a prequel of the first Yakuza game describing Kiryu's youth where he meets recurring characters from the series. As he grows up, Kiryu starts desiring to form his own group, but gives up on this when his girlfriend is sexually assaulted and he decides to take the blame for killing the person to protect Nishikiyama. In the film, Like a Dragon, an adaptation of the first Yakuza game, he is portrayed by Kazuki Kitamura. In the Ryu ga Gotoku stage play, he is portrayed by Eiji Takigawa. Outside the Yakuza series, Kiryu appears as a guest character in Binary Domain through an unlockable code and Everybody's Golf 6 through downloadable content. He is also a playable in Project X Zone 2 alongside Majima. In Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise, a Yakuza spinoff based on Fist of the North Star, Kiryu appears as a skin for Kenshiro via downloadable content.https://www.destructoid.com/fist-of-the-north-star-s- kiryu-dlc-will-be-free-for-two-weeks-522567.phtml Reception Critical Critical reception to Kiryu's character has been generally positive. Juan Castro from IGN praised him as an appealing character noting, both his violent traits as well as his kindness. They further noted that while being a \\"badass\\", he stands out thanks to his kindness. The same website listed him as a notorious anti-hero as he \\"walks a fine line between good and bad.\\" Cheat Code Central expressed similar comments noting that despite the character's occupation, he is so kind he takes the blame of Dojima's death in the start of the first game resulting in the expulsion from his family. Eurogamer similarly commented that \\"Despite all the violence, Kazuma is quite a personable bloke, whose love for his friends sees him banged up for ten years over a murder his 'brother' Nishiki committed.\\" VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole also shared similar commenting adding that \\" Kazuma isn't averse to the odd spot of humanitarian work either - he's just a big softy really.\\" Greg Orlando from the magazine Newtype found him entertaining due to multiple actions he does across the series. When reviewing Yakuza 3, Sam Marchello from RPGamer noted the character's notable development comparing his life with the Yakuza to the orphans. Greg Miller from IGN noted how developers wanted players to connect to Kiryu's side in Yakuza 3 as a result of being his motivation, resulting in several cutscenes and minigames which left him mixed feelings. Anthony John Agnello from GamesRadar praised Kiryu's initial appearance alongside his personality. Matt Kim from US Gamer said Kiryu was his favorite paternal figure in gaming due to how caring he is to Haruka and to people in general despite his connections with the yakuza. Push Square listed him as one of the best characters seen in PlayStation games based on his skills in combat and sense of justice. The character's rivalry with Yakuza 2 antagonist Ryuji Goda was also the subject of positive response even if some writers felt it underused. On a more critical view, Greg Kasavin from GameSpot stated that while Kiryu often resorts to profanity \\"he's your prototypical hero taking on your prototypical villains.\\" 1UP.com called him \\"a hard-boiled thug\\" comparing him with characters like Niko and Alex Mercer due to his inhuman powers. They further noted that his powers can be \\"ridiculous.\\" Real life yakuza Midoriyama commented on the character during a review of the third game that \\"Kiryu is the way yakuza used to be. We kept the streets clean. People liked us. We didn't bother ordinary citizens. We respected our bosses. Now, guys like that only exist in video games.\\" In a Famitsu poll from 2010, Kiryu was voted as the eleventh best video game character. In a retrospective of the series, GameSpot compared Kiryu with Michael Corleone, the protagonist of the novel The Godfather by Mario Puzo. GameSpot noted that while Kiryu was featured with pacifistic traits as he wishes to have a peaceful life with Haruka, he still has violent traits as he has no problems with beating up enemies across the series. In addition to Kiryu's story, the site also commented on how well developed were from clunky to more unique as latter games in the franchise included new characters with different fighting styles. Colin Campbell from Polygon praised his heroic traits explored when dealing with multiple yakuzas. Critics have also noted Kiryu was handled different in the prequel Yakuza 0 and had mixed feelings on its execution. Anime News Network writer Dustin Bailey praised Kiryu's role in Yakuza 0 saying that while in most of the games he was portrayed as a \\"saintly Superman\\", in the prequel he enjoyed seeing the character involved in darker scenarios. As a result, he found the PlayStation 3 Yakuza games less interesting due to a focus on Kiryu's struggle for a peaceful life, but, conversely, found Yakuza 5 to be more unique due to its inclusion of bizarre enemies for Kiryu to fight, most notably a bear. Due to Majima showing a different characterization in the prequel, writers found him more interesting than Kiryu. 'EGMNOW liked the contrast the duo had in the narrative because of the different quests they had to pass to achieve their goals. The Jimquisition said that both characters were \\"like-able protagonists who consistently have to act as straight men in a variety of weird situations\\". As multiple games involved Kiryu returning to the yakuza life despite his retirement in the first game, USGamer criticized this recycling format and expected Yakuza 6 follow the true end of Kiryu's arc. For the review of Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, UK Anime Network believed Sega managed to close Kiryu's story in an appealing despite his interactions with Haruto, an infant Kiryu looks after across the game. Destructoid liked the handling of Kiryu, due to his more serious personality caused by Haruka's crisis. GameInformer felt that the narrative gave the character an appropriate closure even if it is sad. GameRevolution shared similar comments, mainly on how Haruka also has been developing in previous games to stay close to her adoptive father and it was this time Kiryu's quest to protect her. GameSpot noted the game touched deep themes as Kiryu often interacted with families, making it fitting for his final game with him as the main character. Kotaku claimed while Haruka's newfound happiness with Haruto serves an positive note to close Kiryu's arc, the fact that Kiryu survives after receiving mortal wounds and leaves reduced the tension the player has. Popularity In a popularity poll from 2018 by Sega, Kiryu took the 2nd position behind Goro Majima. Because Yakuza has a long running history of being PlayStation exclusive, Kazuma Kiryu is often recognized as a PlayStation mascot. In promoting Kai Razor and Yakuza: Dead Souls, Kiryu's image was used in the razor. Kiryu also uses such razor during a scene from Of the End. Sega also sponsored a contest where the winner would get Kiryu's $9000 tattoo. The winner was Fari Salievski. The process took sixth months to complete. Salivevski commented \\"Well, my nickname is now \\"The Dragon\\"... Whilst in Thailand, I had people coming up to me and taking photos, other cam round wondering what all the fuss was about thinking I am some kind of celebrity. I could not stop laughing! my Facebook page gets a lot of comments too.\\" Kazuma Kiryu was requested as a guest character in Bandai Namco's fighting game Tekken 7. Katsuhiro Harada, the producer of Tekken 7 and director of the series, stated that he was taken aback by the amount of demand there was for the character in the West. Even after the revealed guest characters were Geese Howard and Noctis Lucis Caelum, fans took to Twitter to express their enthusiasm in having Kiryu included in the game. Yakuza producer Daisuke Sato stated that \\"As far as it comes down to the whole Tekken thing, if Harada-san actually says he wants to use Kiryu, then hey.\\" References Category:Action-adventure game characters Category:Fictional criminals in video games Category:Fictional Japanese people in video games Category:Fictional male martial artists Category:Fictional martial artists in video games Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional taxicab drivers Category:Fictional yakuza Category:Male characters in video games Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Sega protagonists Category:Video game characters introduced in 2005 Category:Video game mascots Category:Vigilante characters in video games Category:Yakuza (series) ","title":"Kazuma Kiryu"},{"id":"13041324","text":"Killer Diller is a 1948 American musical comedy-drama film directed by Josh Binney and released by All American.

(stylized as IT'S GRŒ£Œ£K TŒ¶ MŒ£-OW!) is a Tom and Jerry animated short film, released on December 7, 1961. It was the third of the thirteen cartoons in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. This is one of the few Tom and Jerry shorts to credit the sound effects producer, in this case being Tod Dockstader. The short's name is a pun on the phrase \\"It's Greek to me\\" December 1961 was the year before Walt Disney released the Technicolor Christmas musical film, Babes in Toyland. Plot This cartoon opens with a narrator (Allen Swift) introducing the Ancient Greek Acropolis, describing its wealth and beautiful architecture. However, the narrator reveals that on the other end of the Acropolis, people lived in poor conditions and housing. Tom is depicted as one of these inhabitants, an alley cat and a beggar, while Jerry is a rich mouse living in a luxurious hole. While scavenging for food, Tom sees Jerry coming out from his hole to take out the trash. Peeking inside, he sees Jerry's well-furnished home and reaches in to grab him; when he over- stretches his arm around the marble pillars, it snaps back and smacks him in the face. Next, Tom tries to enter the Acropolis and chase Jerry, only to be thrown out because there is a sign that says \\"No Cats Allowed.\\" After failing to hit Jerry with a catapult, he successfully sneaks in when a statue's head falls onto his own, but has to keep hiding from the guards, accidentally knocking the arms off the Venus de Milo sculpture in the process (thus giving it its current appearance). Jerry gets the better of him several more times, tricks him into jumping on a chariot, and unhooks the horses, leaving Tom to careen down the front steps. Jerry returns to his home and takes out the trash again, and the funny ending features Tom running out of the Acropolis screaming as the narrator explains that the Greeks had a word for it: \\"HELP!\\" References External links  Category:1961 animated films Category:Films directed by Gene Deitch Category:Films set in ancient Greece Category:Films set in Athens Category:Tom and Jerry short films Category:1960s American animated films Category:American films Category:1961 comedy films Category:American animated short films Category:1961 films Category:1961 short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films ","title":"It's Greek to Me-ow!"},{"id":"13041341","text":"The following is a list of notable deaths in September 2007.

Because of its Biblical roots, this doctrine is held by most Christians,Westminster Confession, http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/index.html?body=/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XII.htmlBook of Concord, http://bookofconcord.org/sd-righteousness.php paragraphs 4, 9, 10, and 25 but the phrase \\"divine filiation\\" is used primarily by Catholics. This doctrine is also referred to as divine sonship. Divine filiation builds on other Christians doctrines. In the doctrine of the Trinity, God the Son is the Eternal Word spoken by God the Father. The doctrine of the Incarnation teaches that around 2000 years ago, God the Son assumed a human nature, \\"became flesh and dwelt among us\\" () as Jesus of Nazareth. Divine filiation is the centerpiece of the Gospel, the Good News: it is the reason why humanity was saved. And is also the purpose behind baptism. According to John Paul II, divine filiation is \\"the deepest mystery of the Christian vocation\\" and \\"the culminating point of the mystery of our Christian life...we share in salvation, which is not only the deliverance from evil, but is first of all the fullness of good: of the supreme good of the sonship of God.\\" Divine filiation implies divinization: \\"For the Son of God became man so that we might become God\\",Athanasius of Alexandria - Explanation of \\"For the Son of God became man so that we might become God.\\" \\"sharers in the divine nature\\" (), other \\"Christs\\".St. Cyril of Jerusalem; CCC 2782 Basis The Gospel of John begins by pointing to what Jesus brought: \\"to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.\\" () Saint Paul unraveled this mystery further in his letter to the Romans: \\"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‚ÄúAbba! Father!‚Äù The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs‚Äîheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\\" () The very first point of the Catholic Catechism states that God's \\"plan of sheer goodness\\" is oriented towards man's divine filiation: \\"In his Son and through him, he invites men to become, in the Holy Spirit, his adopted children and thus heirs of his blessed life.\\" (CCC 1; italics added) Words uttered by God the Father at the Transfiguration of Christ: Hic est filius meus dilectus (Behold my beloved son) Benedict XVI explained that \\"The Fathers of the Church say that when God created man 'in his image' he looked toward the Christ who was to come, and created man, according to the image of the 'new Adam,' the man who is the criterion of the human... Jesus is 'the Son' in the strict sense - he is of one substance with the Father. He wants to draw all of us into his humanity and so into this Sonship, into his total belonging to God.\\" The Fathers of the Church describe Jesus's work of salvation as a restoration of humanity's original dignity‚Äîman made in the image of Christ, as children of God. Divine filiation, said John Paul II, constitutes the essence of the Good News. This is the purpose of Christ's redemption and through baptism, each Christian's fundamental state is being a child of God, according to Catholic doctrine. According to John Paul II, Christians are supposed to \\"be always aware of the dignity of the divine adoption,\\" so as to give meaning to what they do. Thus, the Christian relates to God as a Father who is loving and provident, and becomes confident and daring as a Christian and apostle. Each Christian, whether a priest or a layperson, is called to a life of holiness, consistent with his membership to the family of God. The ordinary Christians are fully responsible for continuing the redeeming mission of Christ in the ordinary circumstances of their life. According to John Paul II in Redemptor hominis, his first encyclical, at the deepest root of the redemption of the world is the fullness of justice in the heart of Jesus Christ \\"in order that it may become justice in the hearts of many human beings, predestined from eternity in the Firstborn Son to be children of God and called to grace, called to love.\\" Divine filiation, said John Paul II, constitutes the essence of the Good News. \\"What is the Good News for humanity?\\" is a question of the Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. The reply to this question begins with Jesus Christ and ends with Galatians 4:45: God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. Divine filiation is \\"the deepest mystery of the Christian vocation: in the divine plan, we are indeed called to become sons and daughters of God in Christ, through the Holy Spirit.\\" Thus, the Catechism states: \\"By his death, Christ liberates us from sin; by His Resurrection, He opens for us the way to a new life. [Justification] brings about filial adoption so that men become Christ's brethren.\\" (CCC 654)  Judaism's view  Fundamentally, Judaism believes that God, as the creator of time, space, energy and matter, is beyond them, and cannot be born or die. Judaism teaches that it is heretical for any man to claim to be God or a part of God; see also Idolatry in Judaism. There is no Jewish concept of something as a \\"divine filiation\\" or \\"God The Son\\". The Jerusalem Talmud (Ta'anit 2:1) states explicitly: \\"if a man claims to be God, he is a liar.\\" According to Jewish scholars, the Christian concept of Divine filiation has indirect reference to the prior Jewish phrase Son of God, which is found in the Jewish Bible, referring to angels, or humans or even all mankind. According to Judaism's view of Jesus, Jewish scholars note that though Jesus is said to have used the phrase \\"my Father in Heaven\\" (cf. Lord's Prayer), this common poetic Jewish expression may have been misinterpreted as literal. Meaning and significance Christians are said to be children of God because through divine grace they share in the nature of God. [St. Peter] referred to Christians as \\"partakers of the divine nature.\\" () Saint Augustine of Hippo, one of the early Church Fathers, expresses the participation of the baptized in the Divine nature by saying: \\"By the love of God we are made gods.\\" St. Thomas Aquinas explained the terminology of the Fathers that Christians are \\"sons in the Son.\\" He said that Christians enter the trinity through the Son, and they \\"have a certain participation in the filiation of the Second Person.\\" Thus, John Paul II said that divine filiation is \\"the culminating point of the mystery of our Christian life. In fact, the name 'Christian' indicates a new way of being, to be in the likeness of the Son of God. As sons in the Son, we share in salvation, which is not only the deliverance from evil, but is first of all the fullness of good: of the supreme good of the sonship of God.\\" Divine filiation is at the core of Christianity. \\"Our divine filiation is the centerpiece of the Gospel as Jesus preached it. It is the very meaning of the salvation He won for us. For he did not merely save us from our sins; He saved us for sonship.\\" Thus the incarnation and the redemption is for this: :The Word became flesh to make us \\"partakers of the divine nature\\": \\"For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.\\"[St. Irenaeus] \\"For the Son of God became man so that we might become God.\\"[St. Athanasius] \\"The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.\\"[St. Thomas Aquinas] (CCC 460) The Christian then is another \\"Christ\\": \\"We can adore the Father because he has caused us to be reborn to his life by adopting us as his children in his only Son: .. through the anointing of his Spirit who flows from the head to the members, he makes us other \\"Christs.\\" \\"...you who have become sharers in Christ are appropriately called \\"Christs.\\" (CCC 2782) The divinization of man through sonship is real and metaphysical. It is not metaphorical, i.e. a mere comparison with a real thing that is similar. In the Christian religion, God is really Father, and does not just act like human fathers. And God really made us share in his nature, and thus we are really children. Not in the same level as the Only Begotten Son, but truly sharing in his filiation and his divinity. St. John the Evangelist: \\"See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are!\\" (1 John 3:1) And so St. John the Evangelist said with a tone of amazement, \\"See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are!\\" (1 John 3:1) General consequences for Christian life Since divine filiation is fundamental for the Christian life, a foundational point, then the various aspects of the Christian life follow from it, as shown by the frequent allusions of the Catechism to divine filiation: * Abandonment to God the Father's providence, since Jesus said that \\"your heavenly Father knows what you need.\\" (Mt 6:31; CCC 305) Thus Benedict XVI said in Deus caritas est, \\"Immersed like everyone else in the dramatic complexity of historical events, [Christians] remain unshakably certain that God is our Father and loves us, even when his silence remains incomprehensible.\\" * Becoming child-like in piety, because it is a condition for entering the Kingdom. (Mt 18:3-4; CCC 526) * Confidence to call God \\"Father\\" and asking him for gifts. \\"Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us . . . and the confidence of obtaining what we are about to ask.... What would he not give to his children who ask, since he has already granted them the gift of being his children?\\" * Viewing the liturgy as \\"a meeting of God's children with their Father, in Christ and the Holy Spirit.\\" (CCC 736; 1153) * Loving the Church, for God \\"gathers all his children into unity.\\" (CCC 845), and the Church is \\"the house of all God's children, open and welcoming\\". (CCC 1186). And with this the Christian keeps the communion of the saints. (CCC1474) * Giving importance to baptism, by which the Christian become a child of God. (CCC 1243). The Christian should realize the \\"greatness of God's gift... by the sacraments of rebirth, Christians become children of God, partakers of the divine nature.\\" (CCC 1692) * Playing the role of the prodigal son. Because the \\"new life as a child of God can be weakened and even lost by sin,\\" (CCC 1420) the Christian has the sacrament of healing called the sacrament of Reconciliation which \\"bring about restoration of the dignity and blessings of the life of the children of God, of which the most precious is friendship with God.\\" (CCC 1468) \\"The whole of the Christian life,\\" says John Paul II in his first encyclical Redemptor hominis, \\"is like a great pilgrimage to the house of the Father, whose unconditional love for every human creature, especially for the \\"prodigal son\\", we discover anew each day.\\" * Living in imitation of Christ: \\"Following Christ and united with him, Christians can strive to be \\"imitators of God as beloved children, and walk in love\\" by conforming their thoughts, words and actions to the \\"mind . . . which is yours in Christ Jesus,\\" and by following his example.\\" (CCC 1694) * Loving freedom (CCC 1828) * Practising obedience. \\"Although he was a Son, [Jesus] learned obedience through what he suffered. How much more reason have we sinful creatures to learn obedience - we who in him have become children of adoption.\\" (CCC 2825) Piety of children An important consequence of divine filiation is the prayer of Christians as children of God. Prayer is at the center of the life of Christ, the Son of God. Benedict XVI says that the person of Jesus is prayer. The \\"fundamental insight\\" of the Sermon of the Mount is, he says, \\"that man can be understood only in the light of God, and that his life is made righteous only when he lives it in relation to God.\\" Thus, Jesus, after praying and after being asked by the disciples how to pray, teaches the Our Father, a prayer which aims to \\"configure [man] to the image of the Son,\\" and trains him in the \\"inner attitude of Jesus.\\" \\"Contemplative prayer is the prayer of the child of God, of the forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved and who wants to respond to it by loving even more.\\" (CCC 2712 ) Responsibility for the Christian mission Since Christians are other \\"Christs\\", they are in a sense co-redeemers with him, and have, so to speak, the same role as Jesus Christ‚Äîto save other men, and make them children of God. \\"As members, they share a common dignity from their rebirth in Christ, they have the same filial grace and the same vocation to perfection... Because of the one dignity flowing from Baptism, each member of the lay faithful, together with ordained ministers and men and women religious, shares responsibility for the Church's mission.\\" Because the laity‚Äîthat is, ordinary Christians (not priests or consecrated religious)‚Äîare children of God, they have a specific role to play in the world: \\"By reason of their special vocation it belongs to the laity to seek the kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and directing them according to God's will. . . . It pertains to them in a special way so to illuminate and order all temporal things with which they are closely associated that these may always be effected and grow according to Christ and maybe to the glory of the Creator and Redeemer. The initiative of lay Christians is necessary especially when the matter involves discovering or inventing the means for permeating social, political, and economic realities with the demands of Christian doctrine and life. This initiative is a normal element of the life of the Church: Lay believers are in the front line of Church life; for them the Church is the animating principle of human society. Therefore, they in particular ought to have an ever-clearer consciousness not only of belonging to the Church, but of being the Church.\\" (CCC 898-99) Theological views Writing in the early 20th century (circa 1917‚Äì1923), Blessed Columba Marmion gave great emphasis to this doctrine. One commentator has observed that although the doctrine had been addressed by many spiritual writers before him, \\"it would be difficult to find another who had given the mystery such preeminence, making it, as he does, the beginning and the end of the spiritual life. And with Dom Marmion it is not so much a theory or a system, as a living truth that acts directly on the soul.\\"Capelle, Bernard, \\"Marmion's Place in the History of Spirituality\\", in Abbot Marmion: An Irish Tribute, edited by the Monks of Glenstal (Westminster, Md.: The Newman Press, 1948), p. 19. Some believe the Catholic Church will one day formally declare Marmion the Doctor of Divine Adoption.See, e.g., the remark of Cardinal Justin F. Rigali: \\"I am convinced that he merits the title, which, as a matter of fact, has actually been used for a number of years.... This was l'id√©e ma√Ætresse of his teaching, beautifully and consistently presented throughout all his works, and this is why he is respectfully presented to the determining judgment of the Church as the Doctor of Divine Adoption.\\" Rigali, Justin F., Cardinal, \\"Blessed Columba Marmion: Doctor of Divine Adoption\\" in Josephinum, vol. 13:2 (2006), pp. 132, 135. See also the comment of Dom Mark Tierney, O.S.B., Vice-Postulator of Marmion's Cause for Beatification: \\"[A]fter Marmion‚Äôs beatification on September 3, 2000... I was approached by the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints, and invited to work on the process for his Canonization. It was also indicated to me that they hoped one day to declare Marmion a Doctor of the Church ‚Äî The Doctor of Divine Adoption.\\" Christ, the Life of the Soul, Appendix (Bethesda, Md.: Zaccheus Press, 2005), p. 518. Among contemporary authors, Scott Hahn, an American theologian and convert from Calvinism, has written much about filiation in the context of the theology of the covenant. He sees the covenant as a real family bond. He has also written about filiation in the context of his journey as a member of Opus Dei, whose founder, St. Josemar√≠a Escriv√°, is a leading writer on this topic. Escriva saw filiation as the \\"foundation of the Christian life,\\" and had a mystical experience in early years of Opus Dei (1931) that led him to emphasize this aspect of Christian life. Fernando Ocariz, who wrote God as Father (1998) is another theologian who has several works on divine filiation.

He was a 2006 recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship (sometimes nicknamed the \\"genius grant\\"). In 2005, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. Biography Background and education Eggan grew up in Normal, Illinois, the son of Chris and Larry Eggan and one of five children,https://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2006/07/03/he_sees_stem_cells_as_a_solution/ - \\"four sisters and a brother. his father being a math professor at Illinois State University.B-N native awarded MacArthur 'genius' grant After completing his bachelor's degree in microbiology at the University of Illinois, he applied to medical school to become a doctor, but his doubts caused him to defer in favor of a two-year internship with drug company Amgen at the National Institutes of Health. In 1998 he applied to study for a Ph.D. in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, arriving there shortly after Dolly the Sheep gained worldwide attention as the world's first cloned domestic animal. Eggan began to explore both this process and also the reasons that cloned animals often appeared to develop abnormally, with organ defects and immunological problems - his first contact with stem cell research. After finishing his PhD in 2002, Eggan split his time between a post-doctoral program with genetics pioneer Rudolf Jaenisch and a collaborative project with Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning scientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, as well as spending time at the University of Hawaii. Stem cell research In August 2004, Eggan moved to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a junior fellow, becoming an assistant professor of Molecular & Cellular Biology at their Stem Cell Institute (\\"HSCI\\") in 2005. At the time, stem cell research in the United States was threatened by political pressure due to concerns over the ethics of human embryo research, and research such as this was at risk of potentially being made illegal. Federal funding for stem cell research had recently been removed, and part of his role was to obtain private funding to replace it. Eggan took on a second role as the assistant investigator for Stowers Institute for Medical Research, a philanthropical medical research group in Kansas City, Missouri. Eggan's research goals at Harvard were to understand how nuclear transplantation works, and to make stem cells that carry genes for specific diseases such as Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), and Alzheimer's. In 2006, following \\"more than two years of intensive ethical and scientific review\\", two groups of scientists at HSCI were granted permission to explore Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer techniques to create disease-specific stem cell lines as an approach to various currently incurable conditions. Eggan was in charge of one of these two groups and senior author of their results; a renowned co-director of HSCI ran the other. The groups initially collaborated in researching diabetes before Eggan's group switched to work on neurodegenerative diseases. Harvard President Lawrence Summers called the approvals \\"a seminal event\\". Eggan also serves as the Chief Scientific Officer of The New York Stem Cell Foundation.  Work to date  Eggan's work has succeeded in developing a technique of merging stem and skin cells that has obtained considerable public attention as a possible avenue to avoid moral objections regarding stem cell research in the context of serious illness. It suggests that ultimately, treatment of serious illnesses and understanding of stem cell development may be possible to obtain without recourse to human embryos - a highly desirable state of affairs politically, given the concurrent controversy over stem cell research in the United States. Eggan's team reported that they had created cells similar to human embryonic stem cells without destroying embryos, a major step toward someday possibly defusing the central objection to stem cell research. These discoveries sparked extensive debate in the United States Congress, with opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells from fetuses arguing that these or similar methods of creating stem cells from skin might be eventually used instead to satisfy the conflicting demands of medical research and morals. : \\"Eggan's technique provides a window into exactly what happens to turn back the clock in cells during cloning--and, indeed, in the normal process of creating sperm, eggs and embryos. Somehow, aging is reversed, and old cells become young again. As Schatten puts it, the one-way freeway of life has an exit ramp. Understanding what happens when the cell is reprogrammed is one of the main goals of studying embryonic stem cells. But right now, the only way to solve that problem is to clone embryos, which is a difficult and expensive process. Eggan himself is cautious about his team's work, with an early stage 2005 profile in Nature noting there was still much work to do: : The hybrids still contain two nuclei: one from a skin cell and one from an embryonic stem cell. So they have an abnormally high amount of DNA, and Eggan needs to work out how to remove the embryonic stem cell's DNA. Eggan adds that he has only just begun working with the hybrids, so it is not clear what they will or won't be able to do. \\"It's frustrating,\\" Eggan says, \\"because they're implying that our work is a solution, which it is not yet. These are ideas in their most nascent stages.\\" Work as spokesperson Forbes noted in Eggan's 2007 profile that: : \\"Eggan is also becoming one of science's more outspoken voices, defending the necessity of pursuing embryonic cell research through all available means as a way of understanding scourges [such as degenerative diseases].\\" Publications Eggan's five most highly cited publications are: * Humpherys, D; Eggan, K; Akutsu, H; Hochedlinger, K; Rideout, WM; Biniszkiewicz, D; Yanagimachi, R; Jaenisch, R. \\"Epigenetic instability in ES cells and cloned mice\\": Science, 293 (5527): 95-97 JUL 6 2001, Times Cited: 288 * Rideout, WM; Eggan, K; Jaenisch, R. \\"Nuclear cloning and epigenetic reprogramming of the genome.

The album was released on October 23, 2007. It was produced by Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump, whose vocals also feature throughout the album. The album peaked at No. 80 on Billboard 200. It has sold more than 40,000 copies to date. Background Cobra Starship was formed in 2005 after Midtown bassist Gabe Saporta took a trip to the deserts of Arizona. During this time, Saporta went on a \\"vision quest\\", spending time with Native American tribes and smoking peyote. He began to create his vision for a new band, a melodic style of music heavily influenced by synthpop and hip-hop. Upon returning home, Saporta rented a house in the Catskill Mountains and began writing what would become the band's debut album, While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets. He posted a parody response to Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" titled \\"Hollaback Boy\\" on Myspace. The song gained Saporta notoriety on the internet and he eventually signed to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz's label, Decaydance Records. Midtown's management company soon set Saporta up with an opportunity to record a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 Snakes on a Plane. Along with members of The Academy Is..., Gym Class Heroes, and The Sounds, Saporta recorded \\"Snakes on a Plane (Bring It)\\", which became a minor hit. During the recording of While the City Sleeps, We Rule the Streets, Saporta began recruiting new members to complete the group's lineup. He first enlisted drummer Nate Navarro, whom he met on tour while Navarro sold merchandise for fellow touring act Hidden In Plain View. After seeing Saporta in Entertainment Weekly, guitarist Ryland Blackinton and bassist Alex Suarez, who lived in the same apartment building as Midtown drummer Rob Hitt, emailed Saporta asking to join the group. The lineup was completed by keytarist Elisa Schwartz, who was later replaced by Victoria Asher in December 2006. Recording and production While on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour, the group began writing music together. The members recorded their individual parts on their laptops in the band's bus. By the time Cobra Starship entered the studio to work on a new album, much of the material was already written. The album was recorded in twenty days at Mission Sound Studios in Brooklyn, New York. Composition Music The album has been described as \\"11 tracks of unabashed party jams, full of big hooky electropop, super-produced guitar crunch and the occasional T-Pain-style vocoder thrown in for good measure.\\" \\"Smile for the Paparazzi\\" contains Latin influences, and \\"introduces a touch of Spanish heat to a thoroughly Americanized album\\". Philadelphia-based gay hip-hop trio V.I.P appears on \\"Damn You Look Good and I'm Drunk (Scandalous)\\". Blackinton commented on the collaboration, stating, \\"V.I.P. are the best. Seriously. They're these dudes from Philly...and they write hard-core gay rap songs. And we had 'Scandalous,' and we thought it would be a good idea to have them come in and just offer their vocal talents. It was probably the most awesome thing we've ever done.\\" Lyrics The majority of the lyrics on ¬°Viva la Cobra! are inspired by Cobra Starship's rise to fame. Saporta explained \\"All of us played in punk- rock bands growing up, and we could never have dreamed of having this level of celebrity...On one hand, it's awesome because you're hanging out with all your friends, you're getting the VIP treatment. But then you also see how it's just like this big [flattery] convention. And the record is sort of about that contradiction, where on one hand you wanna have fun and party, but at the same time, it's a critique of that whole lifestyle.\\" \\"Damn You Look Good and I'm Drunk (Scandalous)\\", which was originally titled \\"Fake Boobs and Rollerblades\\", discusses trashy women who the band often met at parties. Title Through the Fueled by Ramen street team, the band allowed members of the street team to choose between two possible song titles for five different songs on the record. The album was originally going to be called If the World Is Ending, We're Throwing the Party; however, singer Gabe Saporta stated that: Critical reception Critical response to ¬°Viva la Cobra! was generally mixed to positive. Luke O'Neil of Alternative Press enjoyed the disc's \\"party- at-the-end-of-the-world\\" style, and stated that \\"Contemporary emo-pop sensibilities meet ‚Äô80s party abandon on this record, and neither have sounded so enjoyable in years.\\" Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a \\"B\\" grade, and concluded that the album improved upon its predecessor with \\"catchier hooks and harder-rocking beats\\". Jon Young of Spin praised Viva la Cobra's catchy nature, but felt that the album suffered from over-production, explaining \\"Sadly, the glitzy overkill production by Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump nearly obliterates any potential dance-rock charm. Despite killer hooks, 'Guilty Pleasure' and 'The City Is at War' leave an artificial aftertaste.\\" Andrew Leahey of Allmusic opined that the album was overly repetitive, commenting \\"There's enough melody here to satisfy most lingering fans...But even Stump can't give the band another sure-fire hit, as all the dance-pop numbers end up repeating the same steps in an attempt to perfect the one routine Cobra Starship knows how to do.\\" Track listing Chart positions {| style=\\"text-align:center;\\" |- !

(Photo by Greg Brown) Their second album, The Wall Against Our Back, came out in 2004 to considerable critical acclaim, and the group's tour was recorded by John Boston and released as a documentary, The Long Way Around: One Badass Year With Two Cow Garage. A third album, III, was released in 2007 and followed by Speaking In Cursive in September 2008. Harigle left the band on tour in 2007; drummer Cody Smith and keyboard player Andy Schell joined for Speaking In Cursive, which was released on the Colorado-based Suburban Home Records label. The band's fifth album, Sweet Saint Me, was released via Suburban Home Records on October 24, 2010. The Death Of The Self Preservation Society was released September 10, 2013. Production of the album was funded by fans via a campaign on Indiegogo that raised $16,840. A subsequent Indiegogo campaign raised $9,196 after the band's van broke down. In 2015, the band recruited Nashville, Tennessee-based guitarist/singer/songwriter Todd Farrell Jr. (of Benchmarks, Todd Farrell Jr. & the Dirty Birds) as a permanent lead guitarist for the band. In 2015, the band found its own stolen touring equipment for sale on eBay. In June 2016, it was announced that the band would be releasing their seventh album, titled \\"Brand New Flag\\", would be released via Last Chance Records in August 2016. The record was recorded and produced in Spring of 2016 in Kingston Springs, TN by guitarist Todd Farrell Jr., and mixed by Joey Kneiser (of rock band Glossary). On July 22, the band announced via their Facebook page that the original August 19 release date was pushed back to October 14. In June 2017, guitarist Todd Farrell Jr. stepped away from the band in order to focus on his band, Benchmarks. Jay Gasper (Lydia Loveless) joined as a temporary fill-in guitarist for the remainder of their 2017 touring. Later that year, drummer David Murphy also left the band. The band has built its following via energetic live shows and relentless touring, playing as many as 200 shows in a year.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 stream in southwestern New Jersey, United States, and is also known by the name \\"Tetamekanchz Kyl\\" by the Lenape tribes. It drains a watershed of . A tributary of the Delaware River, it enters the Delaware between the boroughs of Brooklawn and Westville, just south of Gloucester City and across from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The main stream and South Branch form about half of the border between Camden and Gloucester counties. Pre-Columbian Big Timber Creek was home to numerous villages of the Lenni Lenape. In colonial times, the creek was a commercial waterway, and it powered a multitude of mills up through the 1950s. In the second half of the 20th century it suffered the ill effects of the rapid post‚ÄìWorld War II development that plagued many of America's waterways. As of 2007, it had recovered somewhat, thanks to pollution controls and improvements in sewage treatment. The Name The creek was named Tetamekanchz by the local Lenape tribe, with the North Branch named Tetamekanchz, the Chews Landing section named Arwames, Beaver Branch called Tekoke, and Little Timber Creek named Sassackon.Mickle, Isaac , 1845. Accessed January 4, 2008. The earliest recorded use of the current name is by an early Dutch explorer, David P. DeVries, who refers to a Timmer Kill, \\"Timber Creek\\" in Dutch, in his memoirs of his journey of 1630‚Äì1633, after the construction of Fort Nassau at its mouth.Cleary, William E. History of Fort Nassau, February 18, 2007. Accessed September 5, 2007. This name became anglicized when the Quakers arrived. In 1697, the West Jersey Proprietors, in creating the town of Gloucester, decreed that the name be the \\"Gloucester River\\", and although that name did appear in documents for several years, it faded away. A much smaller creek lying to the north, Little Timber Creek, finds the Delaware at the same place as its larger namesake. To differentiate between the two, the latter came to be known as \\"Great Timber Creek\\", which soon became \\"Big Timber Creek\\". Even so, at the end of the 20th century it was still usually referred to in speech as simply \\"Timber Creek\\". Description Course (Note: All course mileage figures are approximate river miles, not as the crow flies.) Big Timber Creek flows roughly to the northwest. Two streams, the North Branch and the South Branch, join above its mouth to form the main stream. The South Branch is considered the source stream. Both branches are dammed at several points to form impoundments‚Äîno natural lakes occur along either branch. South Branch South Branch, just below Blackwood Lake, looking downstream Two streams join to form the South Branch of Big Timber Creek, the Big Lebanon Branch and the Little Lebanon Branch. Big Lebanon Branch is considered the source stream, as it is the longer. Indeed, it appears on some maps as \\"Big Timber Creek\\". It rises near Cross Keys in Gloucester County (under a housing development) at an elevation of about and flows northwesterly , fed by several streams from the east along the way, to its confluence with the Little Lebanon Branch just above Nash's Lake in Turnersville. About north of its source, at the head of Jones Lake, Big Lebanon receives Long Hollow Branch. Jones Lake is formed by a dam about a on and lies at an elevation of about . Just beyond the dam, Chestnut Branch comes in, and Big Lebanon veers northwest to run along the south side of the Atlantic City Expressway. beyond Chestnut Branch it receives Slab Bridge Branch, and after another half mile, Jeremys Field Branch about above its confluence with Little Lebanon. Little Lebanon Branch lies within Gloucester County. It begins at Baum Pond (in 2007, dry) at an elevation of about near the intersection of Stagecoach Road and the Black Horse Pike. It flows roughly north for to meet the Big Lebanon and with it form the South Branch of Big Timber Creek. Little Lebanon has no significant tributaries. The South Branch proper begins just above Nash's Lake in Washington Township and runs northward for to the point where it joins the North Branch. It forms several impoundments and receives a number of smaller streams over its course. Just below its head, the South Branch passes under the Atlantic City Expressway to be dammed about a third of a mile down to form Nash's Lake at an elevation of . After weaving once under the highway for about two-thirds of a mile (1 km), it receives Stone Bridge Branch and Toms Branch from the east in quick succession and, passing under the highway (now Route 42) to the west, it flows north for a mile to Grenloch Lake in Turnersville. Grenloch Lake lies at an elevation of and extends for a half mile (0.8 km) above its dam. The lake receives Holly Run from the northeast before passing under the Black Horse Pike, whereupon Bells Lake Branch enters from the south. Below Grenloch Lake's dam, the South Branch wanders northwest for a mile (1.6 km) to Blackwood Lake in Blackwood, having picked up Gardner's Run from the southwest about halfway along. At an elevation of , Blackwood Lake snakes almost a mile along the foot of an escarpment to its west. Farrows Run enters from the east about at the midpoint. About a quarter mile below the dam, two streams join the South Branch, Bull Run from the west and Minqus Run from the east. About a mile farther on, the stream grows sluggish and tidal. Another mile, and Pines Run enters from the east just after the South Branch passes under Route 42 south- to-north. Its final mile lies among wetlands and mudflats. North Branch Stratford, looking downstream The North Branch of Big Timber Creek rises near Albion at an elevation of about , about from Pine Hill (the hill, not the town, which is nearer), the highest point in southern New Jersey at about . The North Branch flows northwestward through several impoundments to Chews Landing and thence to its confluence with the South Branch. From its origin, the North Branch skirts the northern edge of the world-renowned Pine Valley Golf Club and enters Lekau Lake a mile down.Lekau Lake lies within a Boy Scout reservation, and it was renamed from \\"Irelands Lake\\" after the Lenape word for \\"sand\\" or \\"gravel,\\" apparently translated \\"sandpiper\\" by the Order of the Arrow. A teardrop-shaped impoundment about third of a mile (0.5 km) long, Lekau Lake lies at an elevation of in a hollow of the hills. Leaving the lake, the North Branch twines its way a mile northwest, down to , and enters Clementon Lake in Clementon, long a recreational mecca for the region. A quarter mile (0.4 km) below the lake Trout Run enters from the east, and a half mile farther on, Gravelly Run. The North Branch then runs more to the west for a mile to Laurel Lake, a sinuous half-mile-long (0.8 km) impoundment which lies at an elevation of about . The North Branch continues its westerly course for three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) below Laurel Lake, turning northward where Mason Run enters from the south. It turns to the westward again after another three-quarters of a mile, immediately after which it receives Signey Run from the north. The North Branch then tends northwestward, widening and slowing a mile along, and, turning west upon receiving Otter Branch from the north a half mile farther down, enters an impoundment at Chews Landing. This impoundment is a consequence of the constriction at the point about a third of a mile (0.5 km) down where the North Branch passes under the Black Horse Pike. The North Branch is now tidal and runs westward through wetlands another mile to its confluence with the South Branch. Main stream Bellmawr, looking downstream The main stream of Big Timber Creek begins in Glendora, just upstream from Clement's Bridge, at the confluence of the North and South branches. It meanders northwest for to empty into the Delaware River between Westville and Brooklawn. Over much of its length it is hemmed in by roads, old dumps, and fill. It opens out into wetlands here and there. The main stream is tidal throughout. The first mile (1.6 km) of the main stream is essentially a ditch between a housing development and a trash dump. Three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) downstream from its head, the main stream receives from the north the waters of Hirsch Lake in Runnemede, a smallish impoundment fed by an unnamed stream. A quarter mile (0.4 km) on, the left bank recedes into wetlands, and Almonesson Creek enters on the left another quarter mile down. A further half mile (0.8 km) sees Beaver Brook enter on the right, and the stream narrows again as it passes under Route 42 and the New Jersey Turnpike. It remains confined for the next mile and a half (2.4 km), receiving Ladd's Branch on the left at one mile and flowing another half mile to pass under Route 295, shortly after which it opens out into three-quarters of a mile of wetlands crossed by navigable channels. The stream forms three channels here, the main one hugging the left bank by Westville. The rightmost channel flows through the borough of Belmawr and has several small marinas and private docks located along its banks. The creek then flows another three-quarters of a mile under State Route 47, through Michael K. Galbraith Park in Westville, finally opening up into a shallow bay and flowing into the Delaware River. The land Geology Big Timber Creek lies wholly within the Atlantic Coastal Plain Physiographic Province, specifically that portion known as the Inner Coastal Plain. The coastal plain is a wedge- shaped mass of sediments, mostly unconsolidated, lying upon Precambrian basement rock. It extends from the Fall Line out onto the continental shelf, thickening as it goes at the rate of 80 to 100 feet per mile (15‚Äì19 m/km). New Jersey's inner coastal plain is defined by a cuesta that runs through the coastal plain roughly northeast to southwest across the middle and southern parts of the state. This cuesta marks the transition between the underlying Cretaceous sediments toward the Piedmont and the more recent Miocene sediments seaward and is itself Cretaceous in origin. In its southern reaches, where Big Timber Creek lies, it runs roughly parallel to the Delaware River at a distance of about and delineates the left edge of the Delaware River watershed in southern New Jersey. The surficial geology of the New Jersey inner coastal plain is among the most complex in the world. At least eight of the 14 or 15 sedimentary strata, or formations, laid down since the Cretaceous period appear at the surface in the Big Timber Creek basin. Each formation is itself made up of many layers, some the result of irregular interglacial stream deposition. The situation is further complicated by the appearance of fragments of older formations at a shallower level than more recent ones, owing to cycles of deposition and erosion; in fact, the so-called Bridgeton formation, the oldest, containing iron-indurated sand, forms the summits of the few prominences on the landscape. Generally speaking, the surface of the area is weathered Cretaceous coastal plain consisting of quartz sand, with patches where gravel or clay are found. Glauconite occurs in varying concentrations in the younger formations, and some bog iron is seen. There is no rock, though some iron-bearing sand has become concreted and rock-like. Geography Big Timber Creek dissects the inner coastal plain in the dendritic pattern characteristic of streams flowing over soft materials. It has been cutting down through sand, clay, and gravel since the retreat of the last of the Pleistocene marine inundations which deposited fresh layers of sediment. Big Timber Creek's watershed encompasses 63 square miles (163 km2), including Little Timber Creek, a small creek that shares its mouth. The sides of the basin are defined by the patchy remains of relatively erosion-resistant formations. Nowhere in its basin does the relief exceed , and much lies below . What relief there is entirely due to erosion, mostly by Big Timber Creek and its tributaries. The terrain consists mainly of a jumble of the low, flattened ridges typical of mature sandy basins. The scattered prominences of 100 feet (30 m) or more, some quite steep, owe their existence to caps of iron-rich sand. A cuesta forms escarpments beyond the headwaters of the Creek and along some of its southerly tributaries. There is a small, marshy floodplain in the lower reaches.

Physicians have difficulty in estimated risks of diseases; frequently erring towards overestimation, perhaps due to cognitive biases such as base rate fallacy in which the risk of an adverse outcome is exaggerated. Methods In a prediction rule study, investigators identify a consecutive group of patients who are suspected of having a specific disease or outcome. The investigators then compare the value of clinical findings available to the physician versus the results of more intensive testing or the results of delayed clinical follow up. It may involve, among other things, estimation of the clinical utility of diagnostic tests.

When studied, the impact of providing the information alone (for example, providing the calculated probability of disease) has been negative. However, when the prediction rule is implemented as part of a critical pathway, so that a hospital or clinic has procedures and policies established for how to manage patients identified as high or low risk of disease, the prediction rule has more impact on clinical outcomes.

Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas. History Civilian freighter The refrigerated cargo ship Matchless was laid down for the War Shipping Administration under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1202) on 23 August 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Company; launched on 14 October 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Harry E. Kennedy; and was delivered to the United States Lines under a bare boat charter on 23 March 1945. That firm operated the ship in the Pacific Ocean during the final months of the war and during the first four years following Japan's capitulation. On 11 August 1949, the ship was returned to the Maritime Commission at Mobile, Alabama, and she was laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet berthing area at Bay Minette, Alabama.  U.S. Navy service  In November 1950, the Navy selected Matchless for reactivation as it was expanding the Fleet to meet its greatly increased responsibilities resulting from United Nations decision to oppose communist aggression in Korea. The vessel was towed to Camden, New Jersey, where she was overhauled and converted to a store ship by the New York Shipbuilding Corp. During this work, she received the best and most modern equipment to enable her to carry out her primary mission, underway replenishment. Renamed Aludra on 16 January 1951, the ship was placed in commission by the Navy on 19 June 1952, Comdr. Ralph H. Moureau in command. Assigned to Service Squadron 3, Service Force, Pacific Fleet Aludra arrived at Sasebo, Japan, on 28 October 1952 and took up the tasks of supporting Task Force (TF) 77 in strikes along the east coast of Korea and TF 72 in patrols in the East China Sea and off Formosa. Ending her first deployment to the western Pacific, she returned to San Francisco, California, on 4 May 1953. Thereafter, for more than 16 years, she alternated operations on the west coast of the United States with tours in the Far East resupplying ships serving in the Orient. Among the highlights of her service was her participation in Operation Passage to Freedom, the evacuation of thousands of Vietnamese refugees from communist-controlled areas of Vietnam after that country had been partitioned in 1954. During the early years of her career, she was considered to be a pioneer in the development of improved and faster methods of fleet replenishment. To help her achieve this end, she received many alterations and tried out a great deal of experimental logistical equipment. The ship again visited Vietnamese waters in March 1965 and, for a bit over three and one-half years thereafter, devoted most of her efforts to supporting American warships fighting aggression there. She left that war-torn country for the last time on 19 April 1969 and headed‚Äîvia Sasebo, Japan‚Äîfor home.  Decommissioning and fate  Aludra arrived at Oakland, California, on 11 May and, a month later, began preparations for inactivation. Decommissioned on 12 September 1969, she was returned to the Maritime Administration and berthed with the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. She was withdrawn from the reserve fleet on 19 January 1977 for stripping by the Navy prior to sale. She was purchased from MARAD by Sea World Processors Inc., for non-transportation use, 16 November 1977 and delivered, 16 February 1978. Final Disposition: burned and scuttled in 1981.  Military awards and honors  Aludra received one battle star for Korean War service: * Third Korean Winter Campaign She received eight engagement stars for her operations in Vietnam. Five are noted below:: * Vietnam Defense * Vietnamese Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive-Phase III * Tet Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive-Phase V Her crew was eligible for the following medals: * National Defense Service Medal * Korean Service Medal (1) * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (1-Taiwan Straits, 1-Quemoy-Matsu, 1-Vietnam, 1-Korea) * Vietnam Service Medal (5) * United Nations Service Medal * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal * Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive)  References  *  External links  * Category:Ships built in Oakland, California Category:1944 ships Category:World War II merchant ships of the United States Category:Alstede-class stores ships Category:Cold War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Korean War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Aludra (AF-55)"},{"id":"13041508","text":"Peter Quinel (c. 1230‚Äì1291) was a medieval Bishop of Exeter.

Career Hansell founded the RCA Radio Transmission Laboratory at Rocky Point, New York, Long Island in 1925, and headed the lab for over 30 years. He was also involved in radio and fiber optics research and suggested the invention of polarized sunglasses. His interest in the biological effects of ionized air was spurred in 1932 when he noticed that the moods of one of his colleagues at Rocky Point Laboratory swung in response to the ions being generated by their equipment. He noted that when the equipment generated negative ions, his colleague's mood was upbeat. Conversely, positive ions generated a downbeat mood. Hansell researched the therapeutic possibilities of negative ions throughout his life. Current scientific studies support his findings, and negative ion therapy may be useful in alleviating depression in some people. He died in 1967.

Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade,86:193-19 It is proposed as an explanation of Fermi's paradox since it provides a mechanism which would have delayed the otherwise expected advent of intelligent beings in the local galaxy nearby to Earth. This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by humans. The problem It is estimated that Earth-like planets in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their median age is 6.4 ¬± 0.7 Ga.Lineweaver C.H. (2001). An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect. Icarus, 151:307-313 . Moreover, 75% of stars in the galactic habitable zone are older than the Sun.Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way. Science. 303(5654):59-62. This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth (4.54 Ga). This creates an observational dilemma since interstellar travel, (even of the \\"slow\\" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.Crawford, I.A., \\"Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all\\" , Scientific American, July 2000, 38-43, (2000) This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist Enrico Fermi in his namesake paradox: \\"Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?\\"Webb S. (2002). If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag) The neocatastrophism resolution The hypothesis posits that astrobiological evolution is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the galactic habitable zone. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts. Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that stellar evolution produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the \\"window\\" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling, this creates the possibility of a phase transition at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

Started in 1976 by Catherine Nicholson and Harriet Ellenberger (Desmoines) in Charlotte, North Carolina, it is the longest operating lesbian journal to date with 105 publications. Each journal covers a variety of topics pertaining to the lesbian experience and contains a combination of creative writing, poetry, literary criticism, feminist theory, ads, and notes from the editor(s). Sinister Wisdom accepts submissions from novice to accredited writers and has featured the works of writers and artists such as Audre Lorde and Adrienne Rich. The journal has been a pioneer in female publishing, working with female operated publishing companies such as Whole Women Press and Iowa City Women's Press. Sapphic Classics, a partnership between Sinister Wisdom and A Midsummer Night's Press, reprints classic lesbian works for contemporary audiences. History and mandate Catherine Nicholson and Harriet Ellenberger (Desmoines), two lesbians from Charlotte, North Carolina, attended a lesbian writing workshop in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1976 with the idea of a lesbian literary journal already in mind. Predecessors in the lesbian literary realm such as The Ladder and the Amazon Quarterly inspired Nicholson and Ellenberger (Desmoines) to create their own journal for Southern lesbians. After attending the workshop, Nicholson and Ellenberger (Desmoines) submitted a leaflet calling for any lesbian writing to be part of a new journal. Ellenberger in particular called for \\"revolution, reversal, and transformation\\" and wanted a place that was outside of the patriarchal realm for lesbians to communicate and express themselves. Sinister Wisdom was named after novelist and later Sinister Wisdom contributor Joanna Russ' novel The Female Man. \\"Sinister\\" in this context means \\"on the left side,\\" which is in direct contrast with the \\"right:\\" the patriarchal, \\"rational\\" values that dominate society and seek to oppress the left. Ellenberger (Desmoines) writes in her first \\"Notes for a Magazine:\\" > \\"The Law of the Fathers equates 'right-over-left, white-over-black, > heterosexual-over-homosexual, and male-over-female with good-over-evil.' > Sinister Wisdom turns these patriarchal values upside down as a necessary > prelude to creating our own.\\" Ellenberger (Desmoines) believed that lesbians writing and publishing for lesbians outside of the traditional, patriarchal realm was the best way to connect to their audience. In addition to separatist content, the journal utilized the talents, time, and money of only women in a grassroots approach. This went against the publishing business that was mostly controlled by men. In July 1976, the first issue of Sinister Wisdom was released and was well received. Nicholson and Ellenberger (Desmoines) were the editors. The journal promised three issues a year with subscriptions costing $4.50. The journal's first issue did not have a theme; the contents received for the issue were submitted on the basis of the original leaflet made by Nicholson and Ellenberger (Desmoines) and are thus diverse in subject and style. The second issue called for submissions pertaining to the overall theme of Lesbian Writing and Publishing and was released in the fall of 1976. The publication of the third issue in the spring of 1977 marked Sinister Wisdom's first year, and while Nicholson, Ellenberger (Desmoines), and their team still asked in every issue for more subscriptions and submissions, the journal could continue. By Issue 7, Nicholson and Ellenberger (Desmoines) introduced some changes: the cost of subscriptions would be raised from $4.50 to $7.50 to cover costs, the number of issues released in the year would be raised from three to four, and Sinister Wisdom's publishing headquarters would move from Charlotte to Lincoln, Nebraska. In Lincoln, the team at Sinister Wisdomworked with Iowa City Women's Press and Whole Women Press, two publishing businesses dedicated to publishing the work of women and lesbians and whom Ellenberger (Desmoines) thanks for helping keep the journal afloat. To continue to publish outside of the patriarchal system, the journal had to pay for their office space, supplies, printing, and mailing out of pocket. Ellenberger (Desmoines) continued to urge readers to buy subscriptions for those who could not afford it, buy gift subscriptions, or donate extra money to Sinister Wisdom. Exhausted by the strains of editing and producing the journal, by 1978 Nicholson and Ellenberger began looking for women to replace them. At a party dedicated to female publishing in New York City, the two spoke with Adrienne Rich and Michelle Cliff. Both Rich and Cliff were very well known in the world of lesbian literature and had been previous contributors to Sinister Wisdom. The pair decided to take on the project. Nicholson and Ellenberger (Desmoines)'s final issue was Issue 16 in the Winter of 1981, published outside of the journal's new headquarters in Amherst, Massachusetts. Rich and Cliff promised to commit themselves to sustaining the quality of publications Sinister Wisdom was known for. As an activist and writer of color, Cliff noted in her first \\"Notes for a Magazine\\" that she was interested in including more submissions dealing with the intersections of race and lesbianism. The journal from Issue 17 of the spring of 1981 was the start of a more intersectional journal, moving away from separatism and towards the inclusion of other forms of oppression that coincide with the experiences of lesbian women. In the Summer of 1983, Rich and Cliff wrapped up their final issue at Sinister Wisdom and the journal was turned over to Michaele Uccella and Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz. By Issue 33, the magazine was turned over by Uccella and Kaye/Kantrowitz to notable feminist writer Elana Dykewomon. Dykewomon promised in this first issue as editor that she would work towards getting Sinister Wisdom to be recognized as a non-profit organization. Dykewomon also became the publisher of the journal. By the spring of 1992, with the release of Issue 46, the journal received their 501(c)(3) from the government, recognizing the journal as a non-profit organization. Sinister Wisdom began to be published by Sinister Wisdom Inc., as it continues to be today. Issue 55, published as the spring and summer issue for 1995, was edited by Caryatis Cardea, Jamie Lee Evans, and Sauda Burch. The journal was then turned over to Akiba On√°da- Sikwoia. On√°da-Sikwoia states in her \\"Notes for a Magazine\\" that she wanted to boost the number of subscriptions but that her efforts had not yielded the projected 400 new subscriptions she was hoping for. At this point, Sinister Wisdom provided 80 free subscriptions to incarcerated lesbians, an initiative that the journal has continued to the present. In 1997, On√°da-Sikwoia turned the journal over to Margo Mercedes-Rivera-Weiss, who would edit the journal until 2000. Fran Day, a feminist writer active in the lesbian community worked as the editor from 2000 until her death in 2010. Merry Gangemi was the editor from 2010 until 2013. The current editor is Julie R. Enszer.  Magazine and its content  Sinister Wisdom has 111 publications; four new, seasonal publications are released every year. The journal features primarily lesbians' work, and is particularly interested in writing, art or photography that reflects diversity of experiences which includes, but is not limited to: lesbians of color, ethnic lesbians, Jewish, Arab, old, young, working-class, poverty class, disabled, and fat lesbians. Each issue of Sinister Wisdom is different in content and follows various structures. A section called \\"Notes for a Magazine\\" is written by the editor(s) of the issue, which explains the contents and theme of the journal, updates readers on any changes the journal will make, and calls for submissions. This letter from the editor(s) can be found usually at the beginning or at the end of the journal. Some issues dealing with specific topics are edited by guest editors. The content and structure of the journals is dependent on the contributors submissions and if the journal is following a specific theme. Each journal features a \\"Call for Submissions\\" section that lets readers and contributors know what the upcoming issues will be focusing on. The contributions to the journal often represent different mediums, such as art, photography, short stories, personal accounts, poems, interviews, feminist and queer theory, and literature reviews. The order of the contributions do not follow a specific pattern. The back of the journal usually contains classified ads calling for specific submissions, workshops, conferences, publications, videos, and requests for correspondence. Ads also often advertise feminist bookstores where copies of Sinister Wisdom can be purchased, as well as other lesbian literature and arts journals for readers to subscribe to.  Identity & Diversity  Sinister Wisdom is dedicated to representing the diverse nature of the lesbian community. Works featured in the journal include the experiences of lesbians from a variety of cultural, racial, religious, and class backgrounds.

Digital Archives  Sinister Wisdom, in agreement with Reveal Media is in the process of digitizing back issues from 1976 to 2001.

Biography Heitzmann was born on 2 October 1836 in Vinkovci, Croatia to a Jewish family. His father, Martin Heitzmann, was a surgeon in the Austrian army. Heitzmann studied medicine in Budapest and Vienna, earning his doctorate in 1859. After graduation, he furthered his studies in Vienna with Franz Schuh (1804‚Äì1864), Ferdinand Hebra (1816‚Äì1880), Salomon Stricker (1834‚Äì1898), and Carl Rokitansky (1804‚Äì1878). In Vienna, he performed lectures on morbid anatomy at the university. When he was unable to succeed Rokitansky as the chair of pathology at Vienna, he emigrated to New York (1874). Here, he established a laboratory for microscopical research, and became one of the founders of the American Dermatological Association (ADA). Heitzmann is credited for being the first physician to describe the precursor corpuscles of red cells, structures that he referred to as hematoblasts. In 1872 he documented his findings in a treatise titled Studien am Knochen und Knorpel, in which he mentions that his discovery of the hematoblast was in the bone marrow of an injured dog's leg. Works Heitzmann was a skilled illustrator and lithographer, being renowned for his work with water colors. Among his artistic works are water color illustrations he created with Anton Elfinger (1821‚Äì1864) in Hebra's 1876 Atlas der Hautkrankheiten (Atlas of Skin Diseases).

The antiquarian John Leland (c.1503-1552) saw the monument complete and recorded in his writings that it bore inscribed Latin verse of which one line was: In Barkley natus, jacet hic Jacobus tumulatus (\\"In Berkeley (Castle) he was born, here lies James covered\\"). This is similar to the eight-line leonine verse (or \\"jingling verse\\") on the ledger stone of Sir Peter Courtenay (1346‚Äì1405), KG, situated a few feet away from the bishop's tomb on the floor of the south ambulatory (but originally part of the Courtenay chantry chapel in the nave) which commences: Devoniae natus, comitis (comes) Petrusque vocatus (\\"Born of the Earl of Devon, called Peter\\"). The bishop's monument although now very plain, is of interest as it was constructed whilst the Norman nave was being demolished and rebuilt in the Gothic style, and it was made from some of the stones from the Norman building, alternate squares of pink and cream coloured stone, of which some similar survive in the south aisle of the nave marking the responds of the Norman arcade.Erskine, Audrey; Hope, Vyvyan & Lloyd, John, Exeter Cathedral: A Short History and Description, Exeter, 1988, p.36 Citations References * Category:Bishops of Exeter Category:1327 deaths Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:14th-century English people James Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"James Berkeley"},{"id":"13041596","text":"Harry V. Roberts (1923‚Äì2004), American statistician, was a distinguished teacher and a pioneer in looking at the applications of Bayesian statistics to business decision making and in Total Quality Management. Roberts began teaching at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1949 as an instructor of statistics. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1951. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1955, and was appointed associate professor. He was made full professor in 1959, and was named Sigmund E. Edelstone Professor of Statistics and Quality Management in 1991. In 1997, Roberts was awarded the Norman Maclean Faculty Award from the University of Chicago for his contributions to teaching and to the student experience on campus. In recognition of his career achievements, the Chicago chapter of the American Statistical Association created the Harry V. Roberts Statistical Advocate Award, first given in January 2002. His varied research interests also included interactive computing; time series analysis; the relation between statistical theory and practical decision making; survey methodology and practice; and productivity and quality improvement. Roberts was the co- author of many influential publications, including two groundbreaking books: Basic Methods of Marketing Research (with James Lorie) and the textbook, Statistics: A New Approach (with W. Allen Wallis). He also co-authored an early work on the random walk hypothesis of stock market prices, ‚ÄúDifferencing of Random Walks and Near Random Walks,‚Äù with Nicholas Gonedes, published in the Journal of Econometrics in 1977. Roberts was an early computer enthusiast, and was especially interested in developing computer methods for statistical analysis. In the late 1960s, Roberts, in collaboration with his wife June and Robert Ling, developed a statistics package called Interactive Data Analysis (IDA), used for statistical instruction at a number of top business schools. Toward the end of his career, Roberts helped develop a curriculum in Total Quality Management at Chicago GSB and co-authored Quality is Personal: A Foundation for Total Quality Management (with B. F. Sergesketter). This was a novel application of TQM methods to self-improvement, reminiscent of self- experimentation. External links * Univ. of Chicago Obituary * Chicago Chapter of Amer.

History The group was initiated by Jon Langford (also of the Waco Brothers and The Mekons) as a covers group, with both repertory and cast of backing members constantly shifting. The name was first used for Langford's 1995 album of Johnny Cash cover songs. In 1998, Langford enlisted the help of a number of prominent alt-country musicians (including Neko Case, Alejandro Escovedo, and Robbie Fulks) for a full-length tribute album to Bob Wills. The PVC served next as the backing band for Kelly Hogan's second album, Beneath the Country Underdog; Hogan had provided vocals on the Wills tribute. Their next album, The Executioner's Last Songs, was released in 2002 and is a collection of songs about death. Following this record's success, the group recorded two more albums of songs about death as benefits for the Illinois Coalition Against the Death Penalty. These albums featured such guests as Steve Earle and Mark Eitzel. The group rarely performs live, though it occasionally does special performances in the Chicago area. In 2007 the group appeared as backing band on Chumbawamba member Danbert Nobacon's solo album The Library Book of the World, as well as playing live with Nobacon. The PVC appeared at the Old Town School of Folk Music (OTSFM) in Chicago, Illinois, on October 10, 2009, where the band was originally scheduled to back Australian Aboriginal singer Roger Knox, but Knox's US visa was denied. Instead, the band played a number of Knox's songs accompanied by singer Sally Timms. A second set had the band supporting a performance of Rosie Flores. The Knox-Langford tour finally occurred in 2012, including performances at OTSFM and the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival in San Francisco, California.

British Museum John de Grandisson (1292 ‚Äì 16 July 1369), also spelt Grandison, was Bishop of Exeter, in Devon, England, from 1327 to his death in 1369. Several works of art associated with him survive in the British Library, the British Museum and the Louvre in Paris. Biography Grandisson was born in 1292 at Ashperton near Hereford, the second son of five of Sir William Grandisson (died 1335). Sir William was the heir of Otto de Grandson (died 1328), close personal friend of King Edward I, and head of the English branch of a family that was based at Grandson Castle, now in Switzerland. His mother, Sybil (died 1334), was a younger daughter and co-heir of Sir John de Tregoz.Audrey Erskine, Grandison, John (1292‚Äì1369), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition (subscription required). Retrieved 2020-02-29. He studied at Oxford in 1306, then from 1313 to 1317 he studied theology at the University of Paris under Jacques Fournier, who later became Pope Benedict XII. He returned to study at Oxford 1326‚Äì7. Later in Avignon he became the chaplain and friend of Pope John XXII, who mentored him and sent him on diplomatic missions. The Pope rewarded Grandisson by making him prebendary at York, Wells, and Lincoln, and, in October 1310, Archdeacon of Nottingham. When his elder brother Peter died in 1358 without an heir, John became the head of the family. Bishop of Exeter Grandisson was nominated as Bishop of Exeter on 10 August 1327 and was consecrated on 18 October 1327 at Avignon. His enthronement at Exeter was on 22 August 1328. He then differenced his paternal coat of arms by substituting a bishop's mitre for the central eaglet on the bend. The Diocese of Exeter was in some disarray after the murder of Bishop Stapeldon in 1326 and the two succeeding short-lived bishoprics of James Berkeley and John Godeley. On his arrival in Exeter, Grandisson encountered a number of problems including debt, hostility from his chapter, and poor relations with Hugh de Courtenay, later to become Earl of Devon. However, his registers record his forceful personality which exhibited itself in his diligent enforcement of discipline, the suppression of abuses and punishment of offenders. On the other hand he took great care for the education and religion of the laity, encouraging interest in St Sidwell and urging the lives of Cornish saints to be recorded. His principal residence was on his manor of Chudleigh and he was evidently an unwilling traveller, only rarely leaving his diocese to attend parliament or an ecclesiastical convocation. From Bishop Stapledon, Grandisson inherited a partly-rebuilt Cathedral. In December 1328 he consecrated the high altar and then started raising funds from the diocese to complete the nave, of which only the first bay had been completed. He was assisted by master mason, Thomas Witney, who had been working on the cathedral since about 1313. After Witney's death, c.1342, the work was continued by William Joy. Grandisson's main interests for the cathedral were his own chantry chapel, some of the roof bosses (especially the one depicting Thomas Becket's murder ‚Äì a particular interest of his), and probably the minstrel's gallery. In 1335 Grandisson founded a College of Secular Canons at Ottery St Mary in Devon, as a choir school for eight boys and a Master of Grammar, which survives today as The King's School. However, his largest project ‚Äì in which he took a great personal interest ‚Äì was the rebuilding and establishment as a collegiate church of the church at Ottery St Mary. Taking ten years from 1337, the rebuilding was contemporaneous with work ongoing at Exeter Cathedral and its construction mirrors several features of the cathedral. Grandisson's younger brother Otho helped fund the church and family heraldry appeared widely throughout the building, much of which has been later destroyed or restored away. Grandisson donated the tenor bell in the south tower of Exeter Cathedral. Named \\"Grandison\\" and re-cast at least three times, most recently in 1902 by John Taylor & Co, the current bell bears the inscription \\"EX DONO IOHANNIS GRANDISON EPISCOPI EXON GVLIELMVS EVANS FECIT 1729\\". During his episcopacy, he faced a number of anticlerical movements in Devon. For example, the Order of Brothelyngham‚Äîa fake monastic order of 1348‚Äîregularly rode through Exeter, kidnapping both religious and laymen, and extorting money from them as ransom. He also outlawed a popular cult that was being promoted by a house of canons at Frithelstock Priory. Death and burial Grandisson died at Chudleigh on 16 July 1369 and was buried in the chapel on the south side of the central doorway of the west front of Exeter Cathedral, a chapel that he had caused to be built. The chapel, dedicated to St Radegund, was defaced and his tomb was destroyed, probably early in the 16th century. Surviving works of art There survive two ivory triptychs and a diptych made in England in the 1330s for private devotion and inscribed with the emblems of John Grandisson as Bishop of Exeter. One of them, now known as the John Grandisson Triptych, held at the British Museum in London, is considered a masterpiece of English mediaeval carving.triptych / religious/ritual equipment, British Museum, retrieved 7 December 2013 The diptych is in the Louvre Museum in Paris. An important psalter known as the Grandisson Psalter, owned by Bishop Grandisson, survives in the British Library in London. It records Grandisson's death and the fact that he bequeathed it to royalty.Records Of The Death Of Bishop John Grandisson, In 'The Grandisson Psalter', British Library retrieved 7 December 2013 When Grandisson's looted tomb was reopened in 1956, a small enamelled gold ring was discovered. It shows the Virgin and child and has similarities with enamels created in Paris around the 1330s. It has been suggested that as it is too small to be worn over a glove it may have been one of his most treasured possessions, probably worn hidden from view on his little finger.

Full film Synopsis Fatty rides \\"The Whip\\" in Coney Island Fatty has been dragged along to Coney Island by his wife who insists they spend their time together on the beach. Getting inspiration from a dog digging a hole in the sand, Fatty ditches his wife by burying himself in the sand then making a run for the amusement park as she searches for him. Fatty's wife enlists the help of an old friend (Al St. John, referred to as \\"Old Friend\\") who enters the park to look for Fatty, however once inside he notices an attractive young lady (Alice Mann, referred to as \\"Pretty Girl\\") who is there on a date with a young man (Buster Keaton, referred to as \\"Rival\\") and promptly woos her into entering the park with him rather than Rival, leaving the latter distraught. Finding he has no money, Rival gains entry to the park by hiding in a barrel and follows Pretty Girl and Old Friend around the park. Once inside, Rival and Old Friend both attempt to impress Pretty Girl, Rival by trying to win on the high striker and Old Friend by buying her ice cream but Pretty Girl is ultimately unimpressed by both men's childish behavior Fatty shows up on the scene and is likewise smitten with Pretty Girl and begins making polite conversation with her. When Old Friend returns with the ice cream, Fatty pretends he got them for her in order to impress her which it does. Old Friend furiously threatens Fatty, but Fatty kicks a nearby policemen in the rear and makes him think Old Friend did it leading to the latter being arrested. Fatty and Pretty Girl next go for a ride on the log flumes but the force of the impact upon hitting the water sends both flying into the surrounding pool. Rival saves Pretty Girl and Fatty but is immediately knocked accidentally into the pool by Fatty who, seeing that Rival can swim and will not drown, once again walks off with Pretty Girl. Spotting his wife looking for him, Fatty takes Pretty Girl into a nearby boathouse and the two dress up (Fatty as a woman and Pretty Girl in a new dress and a long wig) to avoid detection before heading to the beach. Arbuckle's wife has heard that Old Friend has been arrested and bails him out of jail and the two go to the beach to come up with a new plan where they bump into Fatty and Pretty Girl in their disguises. Old Friend finds himself attracted to Fatty dressed up as a woman and flirts with him before Rival arrives on the scene and reveals that the woman is in fact Fatty. Furious, Old Friend chases Fatty to the sea where they begin to fight. Pretty Girl, realizing that Old Friend is a sleazy womanizer and Fatty has a wife, decides to return to Rival and the two run off down the beach together. Fatty's wife calls the police to break up the fight and three police officers (The Keystone Cops) arrive at the beach to arrest both men. They are taken to jail but before they can be locked up they overpower all of the cops and throw them in the jail cell. Before Fatty can leave he receives a furious dressing down from his wife until he can take no more and throws her in the jail cell as well. In the film's closing moments Fatty and Old Friend stand on the police steps and agree that the pursuit of women was the reason for all of their misfortune today and both swear off women for good. However, just after making this pact two attractive women walk past them and the two gleefully give chase.

These include The Witching Waves and Shoot-the-Chutes. Coney Island was filmed before Keaton had fully established his screen persona. Because of this, he employs a wide range of facial expressions, including mugging and laughing, differing drastically from his subsequent unsmiling, but still eloquent, expression. Arbuckle breaks the fourth wall in one scene where, about to change his clothes, he directly looks at the camera and gestures for it to raise its view above his waist; the camera obligingly does so. Reception Like many American films of the time, Coney Island was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required a cut of a scene with a girl raising her dress above her knee.

Its name comes from the congealed peas and rice mixture that local residents traditionally eat, as the overcooked rice that cakes to the bottom of the pot would be fed to the dogs. Although appearance varies, potcakes generally have smooth coats, cocked ears, and long faces. A group of potcakes is known as a parliament.  History  Dogs on various Caribbean islands share a common ancestry; many residents of Turks and Caicos were originally from nearby islands and took their dogs with them. Three types may have contributed to development: dogs the Arawak brought with them to the Bahamas; terriers protecting supplies from rodents on ships that arrived in Eleuthera, New Providence, and the Abaco Islands; and dogs from North Carolina that arrived with Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War period. It is also likely that the early Spanish settlers may have introduced their own dogs. As these could have included fighting dogs, the Arawak dogs may have been killed off. In addition, many breeds were imported in the 20th century which interbred with the local dogs, so making the mix of breeds in the potcake dynamic.(Fielding. Mather & Isaacs, 2005) DNA studies have shown no residue of early dog DNA in today's potcakes. Any such remaining DNA has become inconsequential due to the constant imports of dogs with the arrival of colonizers.(Fielding, Ballance & Fielding, 2013) The type's name is derived from the term \\"potcake\\", which refers to the congealed rice mixture at the bottom of the family cooking pot that Bahamians have traditionally fed dogsFielding, Mather & Isaacs, 2005) In Nassau alone, there are an estimated 5,000 to 8,000 stray potcakes. In the late 1970s, The Bahamas named the type the \\"Royal Bahamian Potcake\\". As of February 2011, the Bahamas Kennel Club lists it separately from the mixed-breed dog within Group 9 ‚Äì Non-Registered.  Description   Appearance  Although described as having a \\"shepherd- mix\\" look, the potcake dog's appearance varies by island. It may resemble a typical pariah dog or have hound, mastiff, spaniel, terrier, or retriever characteristics. The type typically has pointed and cocked ears, a long face, and a smooth coat without undercoat, or less commonly, a \\"shaggy\\" or rough coat. As a result of their mixed heritage, potcakes vary widely in terms of color, with many being brown, white, black, and far more with mixed coats. On average, a potcake dog will stand approximately at the withers. Healthy dogs typically weigh from , while strays may weigh only . Mallory, Royal Bahamian Potcake dog, 5 months old, rescued after Hurricane Dorian 2019  Behaviour  According to Jane Parker-Rauw, potcake dogs are intelligent, loyal, calm, and resilient. Unlike many dog breeds, potcakes are able to eat many foods that would be upsetting to most dogs. Their stomachs are incredibly hardy. However, they tend to wander if not properly confined or supervised.  Overpopulation and rescue efforts  The number of stray potcake dogs on the Turks and Caicos Islands has apparently increased, despite spay-and-neuter programmes designed to minimise their numbers. Because the territory is dependent on tourism, officials consider the dogs nuisances, and police have shot and poisoned them. Strays have a median age of three years. In the Bahamas, misconceptions about spaying and neutering dissuade residents from altering their pets. According to The Bahamas Advocates for Animal Rights group, there are 11,000 unowned dogs in New Providence. Forty five percent of tourists report seeing roaming dogs, and two percent state they were \\"scared\\" by their presence. Local organisations adopt out stray potcake dogs to alleviate the overpopulation problem. In 2005, Turks and Caicos-based rescue organisation Potcake Place became a registered charity. After running out of families to adopt to on Providenciales, volunteers connected with potential adopters through the rescue's website www.potcakeplace.com and Facebook page. Puppies are vaccinated and sent on airlifts free of charge to adopters. Additionally, several no-kill United States shelters accept potcake puppies. The Humane Society of Grand Bahama, located in Freeport, ships them to Florida on ferries. The canine charity OutPaws airlifted 1,001 potcakes from the Caribbean to Denver, Colorado in 2013, and placed them all for adoption to Colorado families. The 1001st potcake wandered into camp shortly before the take-off of the plane, and was included in the group. In September 2019, the Humane Society of Grand Bahama was devastatingly hit by Hurricane Dorian. The shelter was flooded by a storm surge and over 100 Potcakes and Potcats were lost. The remaining animals were sent to the US for medical treatment and to be eventually adopted out to new homes. Additional rescue programs exist in Puerto Rico, St. Croix and in Saint Lucia (St Lucia Animal Protection Society and HelpAWS).  Notable dogs  A potcake dog named Amigo is the mascot of the Humane Society of Grand Bahama and the BEKIND Campaign, a collaboration with the HSUS to bring greater attention to animal welfare issues. He was also an Ambassador of Hope for homeless animals until his death due to cancer in 2007. Amigo has appeared on MSNBC, Fox News, and CNN, and received the Ambassador of Goodwill and Hollywood Life Breakthrough of the Year 2007 awards. In 2009, he was one of four potcake dogs honoured in a series of commemorative stamps. Potcake dogs Daisy and Dusty, born in Providenciales and owned by Andy LoCascio, are trained to locate fish through scent on the water and distant cries of feeding sea birds. They have been featured on television and in magazines, including Northeast Boating Magazine. Dusty died in the Fall of 2018 at age 15 and Daisy died in the Spring of 2020 at age 16.

Largely utilizing the internet, Bendib now distributes his political cartoons independently to alternative media outlets outside of the corporate mainstream media. By August 2007, when his first book, Mission Accomplished: Wicked Cartoons by America's Most Wanted Political Cartoonist, was published,Kam Williams, \\"Satirical cartoonist Bendib a madman on a 'Mission'\\", Bay State Banner, August 30, 2007 Julianne Ong Hing, \\"'America's most wanted'\\" cartoonist, ColorLines, January 1, 2008 His work has been featured by the Institute for Policy Studies on its web site. In addition to his work as a cartoonist, Bendib also co-hosts a weekly one-hour radio program called Voices of the Middle East and North Africa on Pacifica Radio station KPFA (94.1 FM), in Berkeley, California. He also continues to exhibit his sculptures and ceramics.Elaine Pasquini, \\"\\"The Sands of Time\\": Sculptures and Ceramics of Khalil Bendib\\", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, July 31, 2001 In 2008, Bendib ran a spoof campaign for President of the United States, claiming to be the first Muslim-American candidate. However, Randall A. Venson, an actual candidate, preceded him in 2000.

History Originally known as Curbside Service, the group released one album under this name, I Packed My Bags a Year in Advance, before changing to their present name. Their current name is a reference to the logo of Italian car company, Alfa Romeo. Kevin Jones' father owned a repair shop that burnt to the ground. The name is an homage to his father. They moved to Santa Barbara, California, and followed with an EP in 2003 before signing to Equal Vision, who put out a full-length from the band, Mander Salis, in 2004. The group then embarked on tours with Mewithoutyou, Armor for Sleep, Decibully, and Hot Rod Circuit; however, after rigorous touring, they became fed up with the lack of time they were able to spend writing and improving on their respective instruments, and cancelled the remainder of their touring schedule.[ The Snake the Cross the Crown] at Allmusic.com They returned to the studio in 2006 and began to pursue a new direction, with less straight-ahead indie rock and more of a country and folk- tinged sound. The result of these efforts was released as Cotton Teeth in March 2007, by which time bassist/vocalist Carl Marshall had left the group. On September 29, 2009 it was announced that The Snake The Cross The Crown were the subject of a documentary by filmmaker Nicholas Kleczewski called On A Carousel of Sound, We Go Round. The film premiered at the Louisville International Festival of Film on October 2, 2009. It was packaged as a two- disc DVD/CD set featuring the full-length film, plus an audio CD of 14 b-sides and newer recordings from the band. It was released on October 13, 2009 exclusively through The Snake The Cross The Crown's webstore at MerchNOW.com On December 15, 2009, the band released a music video for the song \\"In Time.\\" The video is part of the documentary film \\"On A Carousel of Sound, We Go Round,\\" and the song can be found on the accompanying soundtrack.

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.75\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXVIII Reserve Corps. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was primarily raised in the XIV Corps area (Grand Duchy of Baden) and the XI Corps area (Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel, Waldeck and the Thuringian states). Combat chronicle The 75th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front. Its baptism of fire was in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. It fought along the Narew in July and August 1915 and participated in the conquest of Grodno and the Battle of Vilnius. From October 1915 to August 1916, the division remained in positional warfare and then fought at Kovel. Afterwards, it returned to the trenchlines until late June 1917. The division then fought against the Russian Kerensky Offensive and was part of Oskar von Hutier's Eighth Army in the Battle of Riga in September 1917. In December 1917, the division was transferred to the Western Front and went into the line north of the Ailette, above the Chemin des Dames. It participated in the 1918 German Spring Offensive, fighting in the Third Battle of the Aisne. It then occupied various parts of the line and fought against the various Allied counteroffensives, ending the war fighting against the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 525-527. Order of battle on formation The 75th Reserve Division, like the other divisions of its wave and unlike prior German divisions, was organized from the outset as a triangular division. The order of battle of the 75th Reserve Division on December 29, 1914, was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935). *75.Reserve-Infanterie-Brigade **Reserve- Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 249 **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 250 **Reserve- Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 251 **Reserve-Radfahrer-Kompanie Nr. 75 *Reserve- Kavallerie-Abteilung Nr. 75 *75.Reserve-Feldartillerie-Brigade **Reserve- Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 55 **Reserve-Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 57 *Reserve-Pionier-Kompanie Nr. 75 Order of battle on January 1, 1918 The most significant wartime structural change in the divisions of this wave was the reduction from two field artillery regiments to one. Over the course of the war, other changes took place, including the formation of artillery and signals commands and the enlargement of combat engineer support to a full pioneer battalion.

Opened in 1912, the viaduct carries the MBTA's Green Line over the Charles River. It is adjacent to the Charles River Dam Bridge, but structurally separate. History Construction Lechmere Viaduct shortly after completion Science Park station just after opening in 1955 When the Tremont Street subway fully opened in 1898, surface cars entering the subway from East Cambridge had to cross Craigie's Bridge and proceed on surface streets to the Canal Street incline. The trip from Lechmere Point over the bridge was slow and prone to delays. On June 20, 1907, construction began on one mile of elevated track connecting the Canal Street incline to East Cambridge. The project's centerpiece was the arched viaduct crossing the Charles River, with 12 spans including a short drawbridge section. Other sections of elevated track included the Causeway Street Elevated on the Boston side of the river, and the Lechmere Elevated on the East Cambridge side. The first streetcars crossed the bridge in revenue service on June 1, 1912, shortening the ten-minute trip from Lechmere Square to the subway to just three minutes. The building of the massive structure was done entirely by the Boston Elevated Railway, without use of subcontractors. The BERy opened Lechmere station on July 10, 1922, as a transfer point between the Cambridge streetcars and the subway cars. This prevented traffic delays affecting the surface cars from propagating into the subway, and allowed the underground service to use three-car trains, which were too long for safe street-running. On August 20, 1955, Science Park station opened as an infill station on the viaduct over Leverett Circle. It serves the Boston Museum of Science and the West End. Service disruptions On June 25, 2004, service over the viaduct was suspended as the Causeway Street Elevated was removed, and the surface and elevated platforms at North Station were consolidated into a new underground \\"superstation\\". This left the Lechmere Viaduct and Lechmere Elevated as the sole remaining elevated lines in Boston. A new portal was built off Martha Road, with a new concrete bridge connecting to the viaduct just south of Science Park station. Service to Lechmere resumed on November 12, 2005. The incline from the 2005-built tunnel to the Lechmere Viaduct is the steepest grade on the entire MBTA subway system. The viaduct was again closed from April 30 to November 4, 2011, as Science Park station was rebuilt with handicapped-accessible platforms and new elevators. As part of the Green Line Extension project, the northern section of the Lechmere Elevated will be removed and connected to a new elevated structure east of Route 28. The original Lechmere terminal will be replaced with a new elevated station to the east. The work requires closing the viaduct (and thus cutting service back to North Station) from May 24, 2020 to April 2021. Demolition of the northern section of the Lechmere Viaduct began on June 6, 2020. Only the steel section of the viaduct north of the Gilmore Bridge is being replaced; the main concrete span is being restored to support Green Line Extension service and future Type 10 vehicles. Only the E branch service used the viaduct; the B, C, and D branches terminated in downtown Boston. When the Green Line Extension is complete, the D and E branches will run across the viaduct: the D branch to , and the E branch to .

Initially sponsored by the AFL-CIO, the United States Youth Council, and the NAACP Youth Council, the AFL-CIO became the group's most important financial sponsor and essentially took over Frontlash in 1971, becoming the labor federation's outreach program to younger Americans. Frontlash folded in 1997. The organization was conceived by Penn Kemble, a Social Democrat and member of the Young People's Socialist League. The \\"Frontlash\\" name was a play on words, originally used in this context by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964Brooklyn College: Lyndon Johnson and National Politics (it had previously been used in analogue computer construction and similar). The organization would work to counteract the \\"backlash\\" against liberalism by blue-collar workers. Kemble was the organization's first executive director.Martin, \\"Penn Kemble, 64, Is Dead,\\" New York Times, October 23, 2005; Muravchik, \\"Comrades,\\" Commentary, January 18, 2006. Structure Frontlash was funded almost entirely by the AFL-CIO after 1971. It was led by an executive director, who was appointed by the president of the AFL-CIO. Membership in Frontlash was extended to anyone, although the organization focused on building membership among people 30 years of age and younger. Local chapters formed primarily on college campuses, but some chapters formed in large cities (as the creations of AFL-CIO Central Labor Councils; their membership often remained minuscule). Frontlash chapters were usually democratic in nature, although they relied heavily on funds and staff from AFL-CIO appointed leaders in the central labor bodies. This dependency significantly checked the ability of Frontlash chapters to engage in independent action.  Executive Directors  * Penn Kemble (1968-1972) * Charlotte Roe (1972-1977) * Gene Lynch (1977-1978) * Jessica Smith (1978-1985) * Joel Klaverkamp (1985-1992) * Cheryl Graeve (1992-1996) 1970s Frontlash conducted its first voter registration campaign in 1968. Passage of the 26th Amendment in July 1970 lowered the voting age to 18. The AFL-CIO became, with only minor exceptions, Frontlash's financial backer and essentially took over the organization. Kemble, whose interest in the organization had waned, stepped down and Charlotte Roe became the group's executive director.Roberts, \\"Youths Signing Up for '72,\\" New York Times, September 26, 1971. Frontlash's 1972 voter registration effort was extensive, focusing on the top 12 most heavily industrialized states. Frontlash's strategy was to go door-to-door and register voters. The organization also co-sponsored a Youth In Politics Institute to teach high school students their rights as voters and motivate them to get involved in politics. Frontlash also worked with the United Federation of Teachers to produce a film about voting rights which was subsequently distributed to high schools across the country.\\"Coalition Seeking New Youth Voters,\\" New York Times, April 14, 1971; Apple, \\"Youth Vote Likely to Aid Democrats,\\" New York Times, May 10, 1971. Frontlash tended to register about 3 Democrats for every 1 Republican.Roberts, \\"Working Youth: The 17 Million 'Invisible' Voters,\\" New York Times, May 11, 1972. 1980s In the 1980s, Frontlash focused more on economic and social issues of concern to the AFL-CIO than voter registration. In 1981, it sold more than bumper stickers, buttons and T-shirts emblazoned with the Polish flag and the word Solidarno≈õƒá to raise money for the Polish Workers Aid Fund‚Äîa charity established by the AFL-CIO in 1980 to help the Polish trade union, Solidarity.Feinberg, \\"Polish Union Buttons Down Support,\\" Washington Post, December 24, 1981. Under its new executive director, Jessica Smith, Frontlash also opposed the subminimum wage proposed by the Reagan administration.\\"A Debate On the Subminimum Wage,\\" New York Times, March 31, 1985. Its two-year culminated in protests outside Burger King restaurants nationwide. The protests included the United States Students Association, College Democrats of America, the Gray Panthers, and the National Council of Senior Citizens. The protests drew nationwide media attention, and led the Reagan administration to abandon the proposed subminimum wage.Sinclair, \\"Wage Protest Bridges The Age Gap,\\" Washington Post, March 21, 1989. Frontlash also supported the AFL-CIO's boycott of the Coors Brewing Company, stressing Coors's donations to organizations that supported cuts in federal student aid programs.Prial, \\"Union Boycott of Coors Extended to New York,\\" New York Times, March 9, 1987. Frontlash partnered with Cesar Chavez and the United Farmworkers promoting the 'Wrath of Grapes' campaign, focusing on labor and environmental injustices in the migrant worker population, especially in the grape vineyards of California and Arizona. Frontlash also partnered with the nascent youth service organization, City Year, in 1989 and provided workers and financial backing for the group in its first year.Wyman, \\"Fledgling Youth-Service Corps Prepares For First Tour of Duty,\\" Boston Globe, August 17, 1989.

Known as \\"Toycott,\\" the campaign‚Äîwhich began in 1989 but did not receive national media attention until 1991‚Äîhighlighted the use of child labor in the manufacture of toys and other consumer goods in China and sold in the United States.\\"Labor, Consumer Groups Urge Boycott of Chinese Toys,\\" Associated Press, November 25, 1991. Frontlash formed a coalition of student groups at the 500 largest universities in the U.S. to build support for the Toycott campaign.Belsie, \\"U.S. Labor Movement Adopts Global Strategy,\\" Christian Science Monitor, February 27, 1989. Frontlash also received the support of the National Consumers League and the Democracy for China Fund.\\"Labor, Consumer Groups Urge Boycott of Chinese Toys,\\" Associated Press, November 25, 1991; \\"Activists Plan Boycott of Toys Made By Chinese Child Laborers,\\" Chicago Tribune, November 28, 1991; Neufeld, \\"Toys 'R' Us Asked to Pull Toys Imported From China,\\" Washington Times, December 11, 1993. The campaign survived Frontlash's demise in 1997, leading to the formation of United Students Against Sweatshops later that year. Deborah Owens served as the chairman of the board of directors. Other staff members included Jamal Watson, who directed the group's communication efforts and Patrick Wozny, who was the political and legislative director. Frontlash also formed the \\"Student Coalition Against Busters\\" (SCAB), which singled out large law firms for engaging in what Frontlash called anti-union activities.\\"Students Accuse Four Law Firms of 'Union Busting',\\" New York Times, December 16, 1990. It also protested against companies which recruited on college campuses and had broken their unions, most notably International Paper.\\"Group Opposes Visit By Paper Company,\\" Syracuse Post-Standard, October 6, 1991. In 1994, Frontlash expanded its Toycott campaign to focus on consumer clothing and other consumer goods manufactured in sweatshops. Frontlash targeted the Phillips-Van Heusen shirt-making corporation, Nike, the Dole Food Company, Mattel and other companies whose products were created or harvested in low-wage countries. The campaign, titled \\"Come Shop With Me,\\" was supported by Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and was supported by the Coalition of Labor Union Women and the National Consumers League.Barrett, \\"Campaign Set to Hit U.S. Firms That Source Goods Overseas,\\" WWD, December 16, 1994. The campaign initially failed to win much press attention,Barrett, \\"Press Muffles Sourcing Outcry,\\" WWD, December 19, 1994. but in 1996 Frontlash began targeting Nike specifically and began setting up protests outside the company's \\"Niketown\\" stores. While the Nike protests garnered some national attention and public support, the collapse of the \\"Come Shop With Me\\" campaign significantly weakened Frontlash.Green, \\"Nike, Jordan Challenged On Conditions,\\" Journal of Commerce, July 25, 1996; \\"Sporting Goods Protesters Hit Chicago,\\" United Press International, July 13, 1996; Bowers, \\"Ex-Worker Accuses Nike of Poor Factory Conditions,\\" Washington Times, July 16, 1996. Demise The number of Frontlash chapters declined significantly in the 1990s. By 1995, only a few remained, and nationwide membership numbered in the hundreds rather than thousands. The AFL-CIO folded Frontlash's operations into other departments, and quietly shuttered the organization in 1997.Contiguglia, \\"Capitol Hill Veteran Is New Chief of Staff In Rockefeller's Office,\\" Roll Call, April 9, 1998.

When it was built the commissioners wanted a fireproof courthouse. They did not want to see the courthouse burn again as it had in 1865. Architect Isaac Hodgson provided them with what they wanted, but with a mansard roof and a 110-foot clock tower. The mansard roof was unusual for a midwestern public building in the 1860s. It became popular later, but the Henry County Court House was probably the earliest example of the style for public buildings in the midwest. Henry County claims the distinction of being the Raintree County described in Ross Lockridge, Jr.'s book Raintree County in part because the Henry County Court House is pictured inside the front cover of the book and the book includes references to places in Henry County.

The magazine had a stated commitment to reflect the diversity of lesbians by actively soliciting and printing in each issue the work and ideas of lesbians of color, Jewish lesbians, fat lesbians, lesbians over fifty and under twenty years old, disabled lesbians, poor and working-class lesbians, and lesbians of varying cultural backgrounds. Common Lives/Lesbian Lives was a cultural milestone in the lesbian publishing world, as it was one of the first lesbian journal or magazine published from outside of the urban/coastal New York/Los Angeles/Berkley scene. History CL/LL was initiated by eight lesbians who were living in the Los Angeles area in late 1980; Catherine Nicholson and Harriet Desmoines, co-founders of periodical Sinister Wisdom encouraged the women by stating that more lesbian journals were needed because Sinister Wisdom received more submissions than it could print.Moore, Tracy. A Decade of Common Dyke Publishing, in Common Lives/Lesbian Lives, Issue 40, Fall 1991 Cindy Cleary, Anne Lee, and Tracy Moore (Moore had been involved in the collective that published Iowa City's feminist newsletter Ain‚Äôt I a Woman? from 1971‚Äì1974) formed the core group of the journal, and all worked on the magazine after their move to Iowa City later that year. The existence of the Iowa City Women's Press and a typesetting firm owned and operated by women made Iowa City an inviting home for the new journal. The first issue of Common Lives/Lesbian Lives was published in 1981, and the journal eventually reached a peak circulation of about 2500 national and international subscribers. When the journal's main distributor, Inland, declared bankruptcy in 1995, CL/LL was no longer able to continue publication. Content The publishing collective wanted the magazine to be \\"inclusive, non-academic, diverse and accessible\\" Most contributors had never been published before. All work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, and all of the project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the University of Iowa Human Rights Commission by a heterosexual woman who believed she was discriminated against when not hired to be an intern. A complaint was also lodged with the University of Iowa Human Rights Commission by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published. The University of Iowa printing department refused to print Issue 20 (1982) because it contained photographs of lesbians making love, and the magazine sued the University and won. The 1995 fall issue was not published, and eventually Issue 56, which was to be the last, was published as the 1995-1996 issue. Despite efforts to raise money, Common Lives/Lesbian Lives officially closed in 1997. Archives The Iowa Women's Archives in the University of Iowa Libraries now hosts Cl/LL archival material. The Lavender Library, Archives and Cultural Exchange in Sacramento, California holds a substantial collection of the magazines.

A non- profit local arts agency, it makes grants, operates the Monroe County Art in Public Places program, sponsors seminars, and manages the on-line cultural calendar for the region . It also manages the County's Cultural Umbrella grants process, under the Tourism Development Council and serves as a leading advocate for cultural tourism on lower Florida. In 1998, the Florida Keys Council of the Arts was designated by the Board of Monroe County Commissioners as the area's Local Arts Agency as provided by Florida Statute 286.011. The Florida Keys Council of the Arts is currently the main source of information on arts and culture in the Keys. The Council also presents residencies and concerts by performing and literary artists, rotating exhibits in public buildings by visual artists, and music in public places by local musicians in a hospital, a convalescent center, two airports, three government buildings, four senior citizen centers, five county commissioner offices, and six to twelve schools. The Council also maintains an artist registry; publishes and distributes a weekly and quarterly Cultural Calendar, gallery guide, and a map to historic WPA artwork in the Keys; as well as maintaining the website, www.keysarts.com. The Executive Director, Elizabeth S. Young serves as staff and liaison to the County Art in Public Places Committee and the City of Key West Art in Public Places Board. Other ongoing initiatives include managing a county-wide Performing Arts Network, a Children's Festival of the Arts, and (with The Studios of Key West and Sculpture Key West) helped facilitate the 2007 Arts Speak gathering for local cultural leaders. Cultural Umbrella Program In the 1980s, the citizens of Monroe County passed referendums authorizing a 3-cent sales tax on tourist lodging (the bed tax) to be used for tourism advertising, promotion, and some tourist related capital projects. The Board of County Commissioners passed several ordinances to implement this tax including one that created a Tourist Development Council to recommend expenditures of the bed tax revenue and to administer the expenditures. To accommodate the different geographic communities of the Keys, five District Advisory Committees were created. They are DAC I-Key West; DAC 2‚ÄìThe Lower Keys: DAC 3‚ÄìMarathon; DAC 4‚ÄìIslamorada; and DAC 5‚ÄìKey Largo. The DACs recommend expenditures for approximately one-third of the revenue which is divided among the districts according to the percentage of revenue collected in the district. To accommodate three keys-wide tourism industries, three \\"umbrellas\\" were created: the Dive Umbrella, the Fishing Umbrella, and the Cultural Umbrella. DACs and Umbrellas are unique to Monroe County. Public Art Program The Florida Keys Council of the Arts serves as staff to the Art in Public Places committee. This committee is charged with purchase and installation of artwork under a 1% for art program in any new major county construction. The first 1% project, The Roth Building on Plantation Key, was completed in 2003. Projects currently underway include the Freeman Justice Center in Key West; Fire Stations in Key Largo, Big Pine and Conch Key; the Key West International Airport and the Murray Nelson Government Building in Key Largo. The Arts Council also facilitates rotating art exhibits in eleven public buildings and several commissioners‚Äô offices, all curated by volunteers from the Keys community.

It was released in 1982 on Boulevard Records and is, to date, their only album. Collaboration After the break-up of Deep Purple, Glenn Hughes had not been prolific in his output. By 1981 he had only produced one solo album; 1977's Play Me Out, an album focused on Hughes‚Äô love for soul and funk. By comparison, guitarist Pat Thrall had worked on several albums with Automatic Man and Pat Travers. Thrall had come to the attention of Hughes while he was trying to write new material in Los Angeles. The two got together and quickly struck up a working partnership. The result was the Hughes/Thrall album. Hughes/Thrall marked a return to hard rock for Hughes. The album itself has a definite AOR sound, but with influences of new wave and post-punk. Thrall made good use of guitar synthesizers and many have cited the album as being quite influential to the direction of rock music in the 1980s. It was critically well received upon its release. However, despite the positive reception from critics, the album failed to sell well at the time. It has since, however, become somewhat of a cult album. Featured artists Along with Hughes and Thrall the album also featured keyboardist Peter Schless and drummers Gary Ferguson (who went on to work on many of Hughes‚Äô albums in the 1990s and 2000s), Frankie Banali of W.A.S.P. and Quiet Riot fame, and prolific session player Gary Mallaber. The album was co-produced and mixed by Andy Johns, who had previously worked with Led Zeppelin, Free and The Rolling Stones. The song Coast to Coast had originally featured on the Trapeze album You Are the Music...We're Just the Band; the version on the Hughes/Thrall album is similar in arrangement to the original. Promotional videos were shot for the songs The Look in Your Eyes and Muscle and Blood and these received some airplay on music channels at their time of release. Re-issue In January 2007 the album was re-issued. This new version featured the original album, fully remastered, as well as two bonus tracks, both outtakes from the original sessions. The first bonus track, Still The Night, originally featured on the first Phenomena album, which featured Hughes, but not Thrall. Another version appeared on the John Norum album Face the Truth, again featuring Hughes. This is the first time the original version has been released. Follow-up album An immediate follow up to the Hughes/Thrall album was planned and some tracks were written and demoed; however, the project did not go any further and that album was scrapped. Two of the songs originally intended for the follow-up album, \\"You Were Always There\\" and \\"Devil in You\\", were later re-recorded by Hughes for his 1994 album From Now On.... In 2006 it was announced that a follow up had been recorded, and was eventually slated for release in 2008. However, in June 2009, Glenn Hughes confirmed \\"I have put the Hughes/Thrall 2 project behind me. We started the album in 1997 and Pat Thrall wanted to produce it by himself.

Jean Cassegrain produced the world's first luxury leather- covered pipes, then expanded into small leather goods, such as wallets, passport covers, etc.. Longchamp launched its first women handbag in 1971 and became one of France's leading leather goods makers. The company's real breakthrough came with the use of nylon. In the 1970s, Longchamp created a leather and nylon fabric luggage collection. For the first time, luggage were light, contrary to the overweight suitcases usually sold at that time. This innovation led the company to design a women's handbag known throughout the world: Le Pliage, a few decades later. The company's products include its innovative \\"Le Pliage\\" women's foldable handbag. The handbag was an instant hit and continues to be the company's best selling product. Le Pliage's signature design, which originated in nylon, has been re-envisioned and re- invented in countless shapes, patterns, colors and fabrics. The company today designs and manufactures a wide range of luxury goods including leather and canvas handbags, luggage, shoes, travel items, fashion accessories, and a line of \\"ready-to-wear\\" women's designer clothing. The company does business in 80 countries through around 1,500 retail outlets. The house is still privately owned and managed by the Cassegrain founding family.  History   1948: foundation of Longchamp  In 1948, Jean Cassegrain took over his father's traditional tobacco business \\"Au Sultan\\" in Paris, France. After the Second World War, Jean Cassegrain catered to Allied troops with his tobacco and smoking accessories. Pipe sales were the most profitable part of his business. Little by little, soldiers became the store's best customers. When they left Paris at the end of the conflict, Jean Cassegrain diversified. In the 1950s, he introduced the world's first luxury leather-covered pipes which featured exotic leathers. International celebrities such as Elvis Presley loved them. Jean Cassegrain created his company, called 'Jean Cassegrain et compagnie', to broaden the distribution of his leather-covered items for smokers. However, the products were marketed under another name. Since distant relatives had already used his family name Cassegrain to sell fine paper in Paris, he named his brand after the Parisian Longchamp Racecourse. At that time, there was a flour mill visible on the outskirts of Paris, at the end of the Longchamp Racecourse‚Äôs final furlong. Jean Cassegrain named his brand et renamed his company after the racecourse as a nod to the flour mill, as the name ‚ÄòCassegrain‚Äô literally means ‚Äòcrush grain‚Äô (miller) in French. Hence a jockey on a galloping race horse was chosen as logo.  1950s: from leather-covered pipes to leather goods  Longchamp's success with leather-covered pipes convinced Cassegrain that the firm's future lay in diversifying and expanding its product line to small leather goods, passport covers, wallets, bags and other leather accessories for men. In the early 1950s, he was already prospecting and selling on all continents. He hired an export manager and began exporting his products. Jean and his son Philippe Cassegrain were interested in expanding the company's markets and opportunities. Longchamp opened boutiques in Southeast Asia towards the end of the 1970s and was one of the first European brands to be sold in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. Longchamp turned into a worldwide business.  1970s: the first women's handbag  As the business expanded, Jean Cassegrain noticed that women had become interested in handbags. Longchamp launched its first women's handbag in 1971 by reworking a toiletry case and adding a shoulder strap and two flaps. The company was the first to make bags out of nylon. Philippe Cassegrain sketched a line of bags in khaki nylon and leather in the 1970s. This collection was an alternative to carrying heavy suitcases and became a wide success. Philippe Cassegrain also invented the Xtra-Bag, a bag that folded down to a quarter of its size and slid into a simple case. The Xtra-bag was the predecessor of the Le Pliage handbag, which was created in 1993. From that time on, the company began focusing on luggage and women's handbags. In 1978, Longchamp introduced the LM line, its first women's handbags collection. The bags were created from printed leather. Items for smokers disappeared from the catalogue the same year. In 1983, Philippe became Longchamp's CEO. He brought his wife, Mich√®le, into the company to run the retail side. In 1991, Philippe and Mich√®le's eldest son, Jean, came to work with his father. Later, their daughter, Sophie, became the company's artistic director.  1993: Le Pliage  1993 was a turning point in Longchamp's history. In 1993, Philippe Cassegrain, Longchamp's CEO, personally designed what would become the company's most famous handbag: Le Pliage, which means ‚Äòfolding‚Äô in French. Philippe Cassegrain wanted to create a practical yet stylish fold-up bag. The Le Pliage is a handbag that folds into a distinctive trapezoidal shape, evoking the image of an envelope. To keep the bag very light, Philippe Cassegrain combined Russia leather handles with a nylon canvas body. The bag's simple shape and wide range of colors and styles, make it the brand's most successful product and one of the most popular handbags in the world. Longchamp has collaborated with designers and artists such as Tracey Emin, Mary Katrantzou, Jeremy Scott and Sarah Morris to reinterpret its collection of Le Pliage totes.  2000s  Through the years, Longchamp has branched out from handbags and luggage, men's and women's fashion accessories, women's \\"ready-to-wear\\" clothing and a shoe collection. The brand's artistic direction is handled by Sophie Delafontaine, the granddaughter of the brand's founder, Jean Cassegrain. Sophie Delafontaine is responsible for the image and creation across the collections of bags, leatherwear, business lines... In addition to Le Pliage bag, the company is known for other handbags such as the Veau Foulonn√© leather, the LM-print motif, the Gatsby, the L√©gende, the Cosmos and the Gloucester (co-designed by Kate Moss). To celebrate its 70th anniversary, in September 2018 the brand put on its first fashion show in New York during Fashion Week. Among the celebrities present were Kendall Jenner, Kate Moss, Kaia Gerber and Isabelle Huppert. Sophie Delafontaine is artistic director of all the collections of the brand. Kendall Jenner was named ambassador of Longchamp in April 2018. In May 2018, she appeared in a short film, \\"The Encounter\\", directed for the brand by John Christopher Pina. In February 2019, the brand unveiled its fall-winter 2019 collection at a new show on Wall Street in New York.  Directors  Longchamp is currently run and managed by the 2nd and 3rd generations of the family, direct descendants of Jean Cassegrain, founder: * Philippe Cassegrain, President * Jean Cassegrain, Chief Executive Officer * Sophie Delafontaine, Artistic director * Olivier Cassegrain, Director USA boutiques Mich√®le Cassegrain, Director of boutiques, died in November 2016. Longchamp is valued at $1.5 billion. The company's independence gives the Cassegrain family stability and allows them to think and plan long-term. Longchamp is one of the last remaining family-owned leather goods manufacturers in France.  Collaborations  In the 1950s and 1960s, Longchamp's products appeared in French cinema and particularly in Jean Gabin's films. The brand's relationship to art continued in the 1970s when they introduced a limited edition series of bags featuring a design by the famous Franco-Russian artist Serge Mendjisky. In 1971, he added leather patchwork to bags. With this invention, Longchamp was one of the first leather goods brands to enter the world of collaborations with famous artists. Since then, they have continued to work with other artists in designing special products and in store installations. In 2004, Longchamp began its first collaboration with independent designer, Thomas Heatherwick. Heatherwick first designed the best-selling Zip Bag, a handbag constructed of a long zipper. The success of the Zip Bag led to Heatherwick's designing of the Longchamp's New York City flagship store. In 2004 and 2005 Tracey Emin personalized luggage for Longchamp. Tracey Emin realized a patchwork Longchamp bag featuring the message ‚ÄòMe Every Time‚Äô. Jeremy Scott has regularly designed special editions of Le Pliage tote since 2005 as well as other collections of handbags every year. In 2008, Longchamp reissued its LM collection, offering a version illustrated by Jean-Luc Moerman. In 2009, Jeremy Scott, Charles Anastase and design duo Bless joined forces to celebrate 20 years of the French association ANDAM (Association Nationale pour le D√©veloppement des Arts de la Mode), which promotes emerging French and international fashion talent. For the occasion, each of the designers created limited edition variations of Longchamp's Le Pliage handbag. \\"Le Pliage bag is a French icon, no different from the croissant or the Eiffel tower. It is chic, sophisticated and handsome all in one\\" said Jeremy Scott. Between 2005 and 2015, Jeremy Scott created 20 styles of bags. Each year, he has taken one of his pop culture-infused designs and used it to give Longchamp's Le Pliage a new look. His designs over the past 10 years have included a poodle in space, zodiac signs, a credit card and tire tracks. The limited-edition of handbags created for the 10th anniversary of his partnership with Longchamp featured a postcard from Hollywood, signed by the designer \\"Wish you were here\\". Kate Moss collaborated with the brand to design handbags. She first suggested adding a red lining to the Legende bag. The top model then worked with Longchamp artistic director Sophie Delafontaine and released bags under the label \\"Kate Moss for Longchamp\\". In 2010, she launched a whole product line, based on her own use of handbags. The Kate Moss collection was made up of 12 different bags inspired by her \\"city living\\". The bags were named after her favorite places in London: Soho, Ladbroke, Goldbourne, Gloucester, Glastonbury. In 2011, Longchamp teamed up with designer Mary Katrantzou to create a range of printed tote bags. They featured her \\"trompe l'oeil\\" fabrics. The designer's bags were inspired by temples in Vietnam and flower parades, and featured bold colors and wild designs. In 2012, the designer created two handbags bearing exclusive new prints. The larger tote bag was decorated with orchids, dragons and corals. For the smaller one, the designer used both an Asian temple and New York's Carnegie Hall as her starting points, adorning both with colorful flowers and lanterns. Mary Katrantzou also designed a Le Pliage handbag featuring orchids and lanterns. In 2014, Longchamp partnered with artist Sarah Morris to create a limited edition of Le Pliage handbags. In April 2016, Longchamp has begun renovations of its historical store on rue Saint-Honor√© in Paris. While works take place, the storefront is wrapped in a spectacular work of art \\"Mindscapes\\" by American artist, Ryan McGinness. In 2017, Longchamp began an association with the Franco-Armenian artist Vahram Muratyan. In 2018, Longchamp aligned with Shayne Oliver, the founder of New York-based streetwear Hood By Air, to develop an exclusive capsule collection of leather goods, footwear, ready-to-wear garments and garment bags for SS18.  Workshops  Initially, Jean Cassegrain purchased items for smokers (particularly pipes) and had them covered with leather by Parisian craftsmen. Faced with the brand's success, and to support the diversification of the products offered, he opened Longchamp's first workshop in Segr√©, France, in 1959 . The company's production capacity increased regularly in Segr√© and through new facilities: R√©malard in 1969, Ern√©e in 1972, then Combr√©e, Ch√¢teau-Gontier and Montournais in the 2000s. Longchamp continues to manufacture its products in France. The company has its own workshops and owns the largest leather manufacture in France. Six French factories provide half of the handbags sold by the company, with the other half created by partners. Longchamp is currently building its new production site in Pouzauges, France. It will move its leather workshops, currently based in Montournais, to this new site. This project is part of the company's plans to develop and modernize its production process. This new site, which measures approximately 7000 square meters, will have space for 100 people (compared to 70 currently) and will include a learning workshop to support the training and the integration of new staff. This new production site should open in 2018. The company manufactures most of its products, except its ready-to-wear clothing and shoes collections, which it has produced by expert manufacturers located mainly in France and Italy. In September 2018, Longchamp inaugurated a new 7,000 sqm production site at Pouzauges, in the Vend√©e region. This is the company's sixth workshop in France. This new production unit also includes a training facility attached to the workshop. In 2018, half of the brand's production was carried out in France. The company employs 900 people in its workshops located in the west of France. In 2018, Longchamp had 1,500 points of sale worldwide, of which 300 are proprietary stores. A total of 3,200 people work for the brand worldwide.  Boutiques   In the US  Store on Madison Ave. In the US, Longchamp has been distributed through retailers since the 1950s. The company opened its first US store on Madison Avenue in 1984. Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom were the first major American retailers to carry the brand, followed by Bloomingdale's. In 1993, Longchamp set up its own office in New York City to grow the business. In 2006, the company opened a flagship store, \\"La Maison Unique\\" in New York City's SoHo district. This store was the brand's biggest store and was designed by Thomas Heatherwick who also created a handbag called the Zip Bag, which became one of the company's best selling items. In 2014, Longchamp had 17 stores in North America. In April 2018, Longchamp inaugurated a new store on 5th Avenue in New York. The brand also opened a store in Beverly Hills, California.  Europe  In 1988, Longchamp opened its first dedicated boutique in Paris, France, at 390 rue Saint-Honor√©. By 1999, the Paris boutique moved to 404 rue Saint-Honor√© to expand its sales floor. In 2013, Longchamp opened a boutique on Regent Street, London, which became the company's largest store in Europe and the second largest in the world after New York City. In December 2014, the company opened a larger boutique on the Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris. The store has 500 square meters of retail space split into two levels and is now Longchamp's largest store in Europe. This flagship store houses the brand's entire leatherwear range of accessories for men and women, as well as luggage, women's \\"ready-to-wear\\" clothing and shoes. This boutique features a wall of Longchamp's famous Le Pliage handbags and attracts Parisians and tourists from around the world. Longchamp is present in major European cities, including London, Rome, Barcelona, Munich and Vienna.  Asia  Longchamp has been present in mainland China since 2006. In 2011, Longchamp opened a new flagship store in Hong Kong, \\"La Maison 8\\". This boutique is the company's second largest in the world (after the SoHo location). A year later, Longchamp opened seven additional stores in China including in Beijing and Shanghai, making a total of 50 stores. The company also operated 22 stores in Southeast Asia in 2014. These shops accounted for 10% of global sales. In October 2017, Longchamp inaugurated its largest Asian boutique on Omotesando Avenue in Tokyo. The store is spread out over seven floors and displays all of the collections, to include luggage, ready-to-wear, shoes and leather goods. A fresco by Australian artist John Aslanidis is featured on part of the building. In 2018, the brand joined forces with the Chinese blogger Tao Liang, known as Mr. Bags, to design a capsule collection. Longchamp has 18 stores in China and is preparing to launch its Chinese e-commerce site in 2019.  A global presence  In 2013, Longchamp invested in logistics to support company growth. The company built a 23,000 m2 logistics center in Segr√©, France. This facility is double the size of the company's previous facilities. The company relies on an international distribution network and sells an extensive range of products. The brand has a presence in 80 countries including in Brazil, Israel, Abu Dhabi, Peru, Chile, Paraguay, Canada, Austria, Macao, Cambodia, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia... Longchamp plans to expand its network across the Middle-East region with a focus on Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The company has also franchised shops in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia. The group directly manages more than 300 boutiques worldwide and counts 1,500 points of sales, including retail stores, company-owned boutiques and franchises, department store concessions, multi-brand fine leather goods dealers, airport shops and online sales, through 20 distribution subsidiaries.

Forming from a tropical wave on August 16, Andrew remained weak until rapidly intensifying on August 22, and late on August 23 it made its first landfall in The Bahamas on Eleuthera as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph); early the next day Hurricane Andrew passed through the southern Berry Islands with winds of 240 km/h (150 mph). The hurricane later made a devastating landfall in southern Florida, and after striking southern Louisiana it dissipated over the eastern United States. Andrew was the first major hurricane to affect the nation since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. It caused $250 million in damage (1965 USD, $384 million 2007 USD), with damage heaviest on Eleuthera and Cat Cay. Four deaths occurred due to the storm, of which one was indirectly related to the hurricane. Preparations At 1500 UTC on August 22, about 30 hours before landfall, the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane watch for the northwest Bahamas, including Andros and Eleuthera islands, northward through Grand Bahama and Great Abaco. Six hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning, and about 15 hours before landfall a hurricane warning was issued for the central Bahamas, including Cat Island, Exuma, San Salvador Island, and Long Island. In a subsequent analysis by Arthur Rolle, the Bahamas Chief Meteorological Officer, national emergency agencies including the Red Cross and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force \\"responded exceptionally well to the hurricane alerts.\\" The same report cited the public \\"[exhibiting] a degree of complacency, particularly in New Providence and The Current, Eleuthera.\\" Ultimately, the advance warning of the hurricane contributed to the low death toll from the storm. The hurricane struck four days after Hubert Ingraham became Bahamian Prime Minister, the first new Prime Minister in 25 years. There was initially a concern over how Ingraham would handle the hurricane, due to many of the government officials remaining in power from the previous administration; however, government response to the hurricane was normal. Impact Map of the Bahamas Hurricane Andrew brought hurricane-force winds, or maximum sustained wind of over 119 km/h (74 mph), to five districts - North Eleuthera, New Providence, North Andros, Bimini, Berry Islands - as well as three cays. The hurricane also produced tropical storm force winds in seven districts, including Cat Island, South Abaco, Central Andros, the northern island chain in Exuma, and the three districts on Grand Bahama. Much of the northwestern Bahamas received damage, with monetary damage throughout the country totaling about $250 million (1992 USD, $384 million 2008 USD). The severe damage primarily occurred on sparsely populated islands, and in contrast the more populated areas largely received rainfall and gusty winds. The hurricane affected about 2% of the places available for rent in the country, resulting in a drop in tourism. A total of 800 houses were destroyed, leaving 1,700 people homeless. Additionally, five schools were destroyed, and overall the storm left severe damage to the sectors of transport, communications, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing. The hurricane caused four deaths in the country, of which three directly; the indirect fatality was due to a heart failure during the passage of the storm. Hurricane Andrew first made landfall on August 23 as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). The hurricane struck the island of Eleuthera, which has a population of around 8,000, and is generally about 1.6 km (1 mi) in width. Prior to its arrival, the hurricane caused the coastline to recede about 3 mi (5 km), which was followed by what was described as a \\"mighty wall of water\\", or a storm surge. The Current, a small village in the northwestern portion of the island, recorded a surge of 7.2 m (25 ft). There, more than half of the houses in the village were destroyed, and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage. On nearby Current Island, the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses in the village. The island's only road was heavily damaged, with parts still flooded more than a week after the storm. The hurricane was estimated to have spawned several tornadoes in Eleuthera district, based on a subsequent analysis of damage to buildings and shrubbery; tornadoes were also reported in the nearby districts of Harbour Island and Spanish Wells. Towns south of where Andrew moved ashore received fairly minor damage, although the control tower at Governor's Harbour Airport was destroyed. High surf caused damage to roads and docks along the coast. In Spanish Wells, located near the north coast of Eleuthera, three buildings were destroyed, and a bridge connecting to a neighboring island was wrecked. All of Harbour Island, located northeast of Eleuthera, sustained damage, with several small houses destroyed. Overall, news reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on the island. One person drowned from the storm surge in Eleuthera, and two others died in nearby The Bluff. Track of Hurricane Andrew through the Bahamas, southern Florida, and the southeastern United States On New Providence, the hurricane destroyed one house, but caused no major damage in the capital city of Nassau. The Lynden Pindling International Airport near Nassau recorded 61 mm (2.37 in) of precipitation during the passage of Andrew. Further west, damage on Andros Island was fairly minor and limited to the northernmost portion of the island. One dock was destroyed, and two parks were severely damaged. On South Bimini, the storm caused light damage, including to two hotels on the island. The private island of Cat Cay in the Bimini Islands was severely impacted by the hurricane, with damage estimated at $100 million (1992 USD). Many wealthy homes and the island's marina received heavy damage, with hundreds of trees downed by the strong winds. Later, Hurricane Andrew made its second landfall in the Berry Islands early on August 24 as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Damage was heavy and estimated \\"in the millions of dollars\\". Aftermath In the immediate aftermath, the Bahamas National Disaster Coordinator noted that the country did not need foreign assistance. However, within hours after the storm hit, HMS Cardiff, a British Royal Navy destroyer on regular Caribbean patrol arrived, and within days a platoon of 30 British army combat engineers with Royal Signals support arrived from Belize, along with supplies for rebuilding and constructing temporary shelters. The British government also sent blankets and tents to distribute, as well as water, food, and ice. Later, other agencies sent aid to the country, including monetary assistance from the governments of Canada, Japan, and the United States, as well as the United Nations. Both the Pan American Development Foundation as well as the government sent various relief items. The American Red Cross delivered 100 tents, 100 rolls of plastic sheeting, and 1,000 cots. The passage of the hurricane disrupted several breeding colonies of the white- crowned pigeon throughout the country. Though the hurricane did not affect many tourist areas, officials predicted a decline in tourism by up to 20% in the months after the storm.

Reserve-Division) was a unit of the Prussian Army, part of Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed at the end of December 1914 and organized over the next month, arriving in the line in early February 1915.76\\\\. Reserve-Division (Chronik 1914-1918) It was part of the second large wave of new divisions formed at the outset of World War I, which were numbered the 75th through 82nd Reserve Divisions.This wave also included the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division. Between the first wave (42nd through 54th Reserve Divisions and 6th Bavarian Reserve Division), several other divisions were formed on ad hoc basis, mostly taking the name of their commander or place of formation, but these were not part of a planned formal wave of new divisions. The division was initially part of XXXVIII Reserve Corps. The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I. The division was primarily raised in the XVIII and XI Corps areas and was relatively mixed. The 254th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The 253rd Reserve Infantry Regiment included troops from the Grand Duchy of Hesse and Hesse-Nassau. The 252nd Infantry Regiment was raised in the Thuringian states. Combat chronicle The 76th Reserve Division initially fought on the Eastern Front. Its baptism of fire was in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes. It participated in several battles in the course of the Gorlice-Tarn√≥w Offensive, including the siege of Kovno, the battle on the Neman River, and the battle of Vilnius. From November 1915 to September 1916, the division remained in positional warfare by Riga. It was then transferred to Romania, where it fought until the armistice on the Romanian front. In March 1918, the division was transferred to the Western Front and went into the line in Lorraine. It saw action in the Second Battle of the Marne and resisted the Allies' Aisne- Marne, Oise-Aisne and Meuse-Argonne Offensives. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 528-530. Order of battle on formation The 76th Reserve Division, like the other divisions of its wave and unlike earlier German divisions, was organized from the outset as a triangular division. The order of battle of the 76th Reserve Division on December 29, 1914, was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935). *76.Reserve-Infanterie-Brigade **Reserve- Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 252 **Reserve-Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 253 **Reserve- Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 254 **Reserve-Radfahrer-Kompanie Nr. 76 *Reserve- Kavallerie-Abteilung Nr. 76 *76.Reserve-Feldartillerie-Brigade **Reserve- Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 56 **Reserve-Feldartillerie-Regiment Nr. 58 *Reserve-Pionier-Kompanie Nr. 76 *Reserve-Pionier-Kompanie Nr. 77 Order of battle on January 1, 1918 The most significant wartime structural change in the divisions of this wave was the reduction from two field artillery regiments to one.

It broadcasts on AM frequency 1300 kHz and is under ownership of Cumulus Media. The station features CBS Sports Radio, as well as Jim Rome, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, and Colorado Springs Sky Sox. History Early Years On September 22, 1922, Colorado Springs' first commercial radio station, KFUM (\\"Known For Unsurpassed Mountain scenery\\"), was licensed. Its call sign changed to KVOR (Voice Of the Rockies) when the station was purchased by the Reynolds Radio Co., founded by Denver radio pioneer Dr. William \\"Doc\\" Reynolds. As of 1933, the studio and transmitter were both located at the Mining Exchange Building. During the Golden Age of Radio, KVOR was a CBS affiliate, airing its schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts. It broadcast on 1270 kilocycles, at 1,000 watts of power, with studios in the Antlers Hotel.Broadcasting Yearbook 1936 page 40 In the 1940s, it moved to 1300 kHz. In 1960, it added an FM sister station, 92.9 KVOR-FM (now KKPK), simulcasting the AM station's programming.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page 123 In 1968, 1300 KVOR received permission from the Federal Communications Commission to boost its daytime power to 5,000 watts. Middle of The Road In the 1960s, as network programming shifted to television, KVOR switched to a middle of the road format of popular music, news and sports, still as a CBS affiliate. By the 1980s, as music listening switched to FM, KVOR began adding talk programming to its line up, using NBC's Talknet service at night. Switch to Talk By 1984, KVOR had completed the switch to all-talk programming, with its FM station moving to an adult contemporary music format as KSPZ, \\"Z93.\\" KVOR picked up talk shows from the ABC TalkRadio network and added ABC Radio News, replacing CBS as its network.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B41 In 1996, KVOR and KSPZ (now KKPK) were acquired by Triathlon Broadcasting Of Colorado Springs, which also owned 99.9 KVUU and 740 KSSS (later KTWK). During this time, advertising time on these stations was controlled by Citadel Broadcasting through a local marketing agreement (LMA), while the actual broadcast operations were under the control of Triathlon. In 1999, Citadel Broadcasting fully acquired KVOR, KSPZ and KTWK by exchanging 106.3 KKLI with Triathlon (now merged with iHeartMedia, Inc.) thus ending the LMA. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. former logo In March 2000 when KVOR switched frequencies with then-KTWK on AM 740. The format became Classic country in December 2000 when the station changed calls to KUBL (Standing for 'The Bull'). The station adopted a progressive talk format in 2002 and adopted the call letters KBZC, calling itself 'The Buzz 1300' In 2004, the format changed again to a sports radio format, calling itself \\"Sports Animal 1300\\" and adopting the call letters KKML. The station signed on as an affiliate of Fox Sports Radio then signed on with ESPN Radio in 2007. In July 2008, Citadel Broadcasting abandoned the sports format in favor of a 'Classic Country' format as \\"KCS 1300 AM\\" to complement its sister Mainstream Country station KATC-FM and to pay homage to the former \\"KCS Country\\" station (see KCS History). This format change also brought Don Imus into the Colorado Springs Market, and used Jones Radio Networks Classic Country Satellite Programming as its lineup. The Jones format was changed in mid 2009 to Citadel Media's in-house Real Country format, featuring a mix of classic country and country currents. The most recent change of 1300's format back to sports radio took effect on November 5, 2009, with returning 'Sports Animal 1300' to Colorado Springs. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. KCS history KKCS-FM went on the air in Colorado Springs on September 12, 1979 broadcasting a country music format. The station was known as \\"The Most Country KCS 102.\\" KKCS remained a major competitor in the market for country until purchased by Bustos Media in 2005. After being purchased, KKCS moved frequencies from 101.9 FM to 104.5 FM (taking that frequency from Canon City, Colorado country station KSTY). With the 104.5 transmitter being located in Canon City, the signal of KCS was severely limited to Colorado Springs. In 2006, the station let go of all personnel and played all music before going dark in 2007. The country format on that frequency has since returned to Canon City with KSTY.

Velvet Assassin's working title was Sabotage. It was released on the Mac app store in 2013. Players take control of Violette Summer, a World War II-era British Secret Intelligence Service spy operating deep behind enemy lines, attempting to help thwart the Nazi war effort. The game's story was inspired by a real-life secret agent/saboteur Violette Szabo. Plot Born in Dorset, Violette Summer (voiced by Melinda Y. Cohen) grew up in a happy family and had a great and active childhood. Initially, she started her working life in a beauty salon before the outbreak of war inspired her to move to London and join the weapon industry. It did not take too long for her to be noticed by the secret services, as she was beautiful, athletic and had great attention to detail, and so she was soon recruited into Secret Intelligence Service during Britain's darkest hours. Violette had lost an aunt during one of the first Luftwaffe bombing attacks and to further compound her heartache she later lost her Royal Air Force husband in battle. However, Summer was strong willed and used these painful experiences to inspire her to succeed as a spy for the SIS. Summer managed to carry out several missions successfully before being gravely wounded by a sniper on a mission to kill Kamm, a Nazi military intelligence officer. Comatose in a hospital in France, Violette relives key moments in a series of flashbacks. Hence, the bulk of gameplay will take place during these flashbacks. The missions include blowing up a fuel depot on the Maginot Line, assassination of a colonel in a cathedral in Paris, stealing documents and marking a sub pen for bombers in Hamburg during Operation Gomorrah, and finding three secret agents in Warsaw. Moving through the city's sewer system, she finds one agent seriously wounded (and silences him) and another dead by cyanide poisoning, and a mission that involved moving through the Warsaw Ghetto, where the residents were either rounded up or executed, Violette makes her way through to the Gestapo's Pawiak prison to give cyanide to the third agent. Through her memories, scenes from the hospital can be seen with two men arguing whether to keep Violette alive, give her up to the Schutzstaffel, or kill her to save her the torture if captured by the Nazis. Her location betrayed, Violette wakes from her coma to find the enemy troops entering the hospital. Escaping them, Violette finds the villagers being murdered or rounded up by a force from the Dirlewanger Brigade, a brutal SS unit of convicts, and taken to the church. Locking the villagers in, the soldiers set fire to the church. Violette is unsuccessful at trying to free the villagers, and due to emotional and physical exhaustion, collapses. The enemy leader is shown to be Kamm, whose face was burned by Violette's assassination attempt. In the end credits, Violette is shown in her hospital gown standing on a cliff overlooking a German plane. Gameplay When the game begins, Violette is seen from above, lying in a hospital bed. There are morphine syringes scattered across her bed, and the influx of drugs in her system creates a series of dreams that let her recount her past missions. Players have to hide in the shadows in order to avoid being detected. As a stealth-based game, lighting plays an important role. The HUD provides players with a silhouette of Violette which can be in one of three states. Purple means she is hidden in the shadows and invisible to enemies. White means she is exposed in light, but not yet detected. Red means she has been spotted and enemies are seeking out her position. If she is detected, she will either have to fight off the guard or escape. The game employs a special lifeline if detected called \\"Morphine Mode\\". When triggered, Violette is shown in her hospital gown with blood drops appearing all over the screen. For a limited amount of time, Violette can execute any alerted guards or escape. Players have limited use of the morphine lifeline. The game also occasionally makes use of \\"Blend Stealth\\". If Violette acquires a female SS uniform, she can change her attire at predefined points in the game. When Violette wears the SS uniform, guards will not identify her as a threat unless she moves too close to them, or she performs a suspicious action, such as aiming a gun. Violette's ability as an agent can be upgraded by finding a range of collectibles scattered throughout her environment. Once the player reaches 1,000 experience points, her skills can be upgraded in one of three ways: either Improved Stealth (sneaking), Morphine or Strength. The player can upgrade her skills based on individual gameplay style. Promotion SouthPeak Games teamed up with Peter Chung to produce a limited edition digital graphic novel based on the game. Chung is best known for his creation of the character of √Üon Flux, as well as his work in The Animatrix. The novel was exclusively distributed to gamers who preordered the game from GameStop. Violette's Dream was an interactive experience produced to promote Velvet Assassin. Created by Yomi Ayeni and produced by Expanding Universe, a UK-based production company, the ARG mobilised thousands of participants on a real-life adventure as they searched for hidden treasure and real gold bars stamped with Nazi insignia. Using websites, forums, blogs, video, audio, mobile and telephone messaging, as well as performance and real-life events, the immersive and interactive story engaged players as they interacted with a variety of characters and organisations. One gold bar was found in a lock-up in Fredericksburg, Texas, the other at London Victoria station.https://www.argn.com/tag/velvet_assassin/ Reception Velvet Assassin received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN cited inconsistent stealth mechanics and a weak story. GameSpot review, however, disagreed (criticizing instead the game's poor AI and \\"lousy gunplay\\") and called it \\"a powerful, unnerving look at one of history's darkest periods\\". GameZone praised the style and story of the game but disliked the predictability of the enemies. In Japan, where the Xbox 360 version was ported and published by Ubisoft on September 17, 2009, Famitsu gave it a score of two sevens, one eight, and one six for a total of 28 out of 40.

The Solitude of the Soul refers to one of three known works of sculpture of that name by the American sculptor Lorado Taft, a Midwesterner born in 1860, who was active in the Chicago area from 1885 until his death in 1936. The accompanying photographs show the best-known version, carved in marble and dated 1914, which is among works of American sculpture on display in the Roger McCormick Memorial Court of the Art Institute of Chicago. Additional photographs, Links to photographs circa 1911, show models of this work in Taft‚Äôs studio prior to the First World War. Taft, an Illinois native who had been classically trained in Paris and who came increasingly under the influence of Auguste Rodin, explained the concept of the statue as follows: \\"The thought is the eternally present fact that however closely we may be thrown together by circumstances . . . we are unknown to each other.\\" Two other versions are known to exist. One is a near-same-sized plaster cast, possibly as early as 1901 and probably one of the models shown in the 1911 photographs, now in the collection of American art at the Dayton Art Institute. The other is a smaller but much finer version cast in bronze, presently in the collection of the Krannert Art Museum on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During his lifetime Taft was friendly toward many Chicago-area artists and writers, including novelist Henry Blake Fuller, Poetry magazine founder and editor Harriet Monroe, and his own brother-in-law, novelist Hamlin Garland. Midwestern poet Jared Carter pays tribute to Taft's \\"The Solitude of the Soul\\" in his contemporary sonnet of the same name.

Overview  According to plans, the southern gateway will be near Bethel, and it will terminate in Rockwood, on the western shore of Moosehead. Along the way, up to 12 wilderness lodges will be constructed, each sleeping up to 45 guests. The distance between huts will average 10 miles. The huts are open year round for day visitors and overnight guests with opportunities for hiking, paddling, and biking in the summer and cross-country skiing, fat tire biking and snowshoeing in the winter. Larry Warren, Suzie Hockmeyer and John Willard consider route alternatives at a 2002 Maine Huts and Trails planning session. Scott Andrews photo The proposed route very roughly parallels the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, but generally follows river valleys and utilizes many long-abandoned logging roads that criss-cross the region. The organization has raised approximately $10 million to date and opened its first hut, at Poplar Stream Falls in Carrabassett Valley, on Feb. 16, 2008. It features several heated bunkhouses, which accommodate between four and 12 people apiece, plus a central lodge with kitchen, rest rooms, dining room and common area. Breakfast and dinner are served to guests. Three additional huts have been opened including Flagstaff Hut in 2009, Grand Falls Hut in 2010 and Stratton Brook Hut in 2012. The network now connects over 80 miles of trails between route 27 in Carrabassett Valley and route 201 in the West Forks. A key component to the huts is the application of green energy systems reducing impact to the surrounding environment. Each hut utilizes a contained composting toilet system, solar power, and radiant floor heating powered by a wood boiler. In addition to these systems, Poplar Hut has hydro- electric power and Grand Falls Hut has a solar hot water heater. Overnight guests are welcome to join the hut staff on a \\"green energy tour\\" which describes these systems in detail and also explains the mission of the MH&T; system. The huts encourage guests to follow Leave No Trace principles while using the trail system. The huts are carry in/carry out. Visitors do have the option to buy lunch and snacks as well as beer and wine (must be 21+ with valid ID) on weekends during full service season. Be aware that cell phone coverage is unavailable throughout most of the MH&T; network. It is recommended to bring a trail map along for the journey. Maps are available at the main office in Kingfield, at any of the huts, or at any number of locations in Kingfield and Carrabassett Valley for free. Maps can also be requested online at www.mainehuts.org. Much of the land for this project -- including Poplar Hut site -- is leased from the Penobscot Indian Nation. Maine Huts & Trails' founder is Larry Warren of Carrabassett Valley, who first envisioned the trail network in 1974 and borrowed the huts concept from the Appalachian Mountain Club. In terms of architecture, the hut designs reflect traditional Maine sporting camps. Promoting year-round tourism in the region is one of Warren's stated goals. He was formerly involved in developing Sugarloaf into the state's second busiest ski resort, and he envisions Maine Huts & Trails fitting into the official ecotourism campaign.

In his next at-bat, Santana hit his first major league home run to right field in the bottom of the fifth inning. On August 2, 2010, Santana was injured in a game at Fenway Park while defending home plate against Boston Red Sox baserunner Ryan Kalish. While attempting to dislodge the ball from Santana's mitt, Kalish slid into his left knee, bending it to the side. Santana was unable to walk off the field and had to be removed on a cart. Tests revealed that Santana had a high grade sprain of his LCL and a hyperextension of his left knee. The injury ended Santana's rookie season. Santana started a triple play against the Chicago White Sox on April 3, 2011 with a diving catch off of an Alexei Ram√≠rez bunt. On April 29, 2011 Santana hit his first major league grand slam, a walk-off to defeat the Detroit Tigers, 9‚àí5. Santana finished 2011, which was his first full season in the major leagues, with 27 home runs, setting a club record for home runs hit by a switch hitter, and played 66 games at first base. He also hit 79 RBI, 35 doubles and added 97 walks. He was one of four hitters in 2011 to reach 25 home runs, 35 doubles, and 90 walks, joining Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder, and Joey Votto. 2012 On April 10, 2012, the Indians signed Santana to a five-year, $21 million contract with a club option for the 2016 season. In the eighth inning of a May 25 game versus the Chicago White Sox, Santana sustained a hit in the mask from a foul tip and was removed from the game due to experiencing dizziness. He was subsequently placed on the seven-day disabled list with a concussion. Heading into the All- Star break, Santana was hitting .221, five home runs and 30 RBI in 69 games. Manager Manny Acta spoke of the hopes the Indians had for their catcher but admitted he was not hitting \\"the way we expected him to hit.\\" When Santana hit a home run in a July 18 game versus the Tampa Bay Rays, it was his first since May 15. He later added on a single and finished the game with a season-high four RBI, his first multi-RBI game since May 11. \\"I know Santana feels so much better to get that monkey off his back. That power drought had been weighing on him\\", Acta remarked after the game. Santana matched a career with five RBI in a September 23 game against the Kansas City Royals. He hit two home runs in the game, his third career multi-home run game and first of the season since April 8. 2013‚àí2016 In 2013, Santana and the newly-promoted Yan Gomes split the catching duties nearly evenly, with Santana seeing significant time at first base and designated hitter when Gomes was catching. With the emergence of Gomes' defensive prowess, Santana saw less and less time at catcher. Santana started 2014 playing primarily third base, a position he had not played since single-A, with some time at catcher. After a stint on the 7-day concussion DL in early June, he played exclusively at first base for the remainder of the season and into 2015. In 2014, he reached a career-high 113 walks while also leading the major leagues, and placed tenth in the AL with 241 times on base. He became the first switch hitter since Lance Berkman in 2004 to achieve at least 25 home runs with 100 walks in the same season, and the fifth Indians switch hitter to do accordingly. On September 21, 2016, Santana hit his 150th career home run, doing so against the Kansas City Royals. During the regular season, Santana batted .259, 34 home runs, 87 RBI and .865 OPS. He produced 30 home runs and 68 RBI when batting left handed. Santana homered twice in the 2016 American League Championship Series versus the Toronto Blue Jays. He also recorded the final out of the Series by catching a Troy Tulowitzki pop-up in foul territory, sending the Indians to the World Series. The Chicago Cubs defeated Cleveland in the World Series in seven games. The Indians exercised their $12 million option for 2017. 2017 After the Indians acquired Edwin Encarnaci√≥n in free agency prior to the 2017 season, he took over as the team's designated hitter, and Santana played primarily first base. During the first 84 games of the season, he hit .238 with 10 home runs. In August and September, the club won an American League-record 22 games in a row, and Santana hit .365/.484/.689 during the streak. He had hit 13 home runs and 313/.429/.596 through that point in the second half of the season. On September 10 versus the Baltimore Orioles, he drove in his 585th run, passing Omar Vizquel as the Indians' career RBI leader among switch hitters. Overall in 2017, he batted .259/.363/.445, 112 OPS+, 90 runs scored, 23 home runs, 79 RBI, 88 BB, 94 strikeouts, and five stolen bases. Santana placed fourth in the AL in walks and seventh in times on base (242). With significant improvement on defense, he led AL first basemen in total zone runs (13) and assists (95), was second in double plays (129), fourth in putouts (1,055), and fifth in fielding percentage (.996). The Indians won an AL-best 102 games for the regular season, but were defeated by the wild-card qualifying New York Yankees in the ALDS. He won his first career Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award at first base, given to the top defensive player in the major leagues at each position. He was also named a finalist for the American League Rawlings Gold Glove Award at first base.  Philadelphia Phillies  Santana with the Phillies in 2018 On November 2, 2017, Santana filed for free agency. On December 20, he signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Phillies that included a team option for the 2021 season. The value of the three guaranteed seasons was $60 million. Santana reached 1,000 hits for his career on April, 7, 2018, with a three-run home run in a 20‚àí1 win versus the Miami Marlins at Citizens Bank Park. For the season, he batted .229 and had the lowest batting average on balls in play (.231) of all major league players, and was second in the major leagues in walks per strikeout (1.18). He placed second in the National League in walks (110), hit 24 home runs, 86 RBI, and scored 82 runs. In March 2019, ESPN.com reported that, in September 2018, Santana, frustrated with the team's nonchalance amidst a long losing streak, destroyed a television with a bat in the team's clubhouse at Citizens Bank Park because teammates had been using it to play Fortnite during games. Return to Cleveland On December 3, 2018, the Phillies traded Santana and J. P. Crawford to the Seattle Mariners for Jean Segura, Juan Nicasio, and James Pazos. In a three-team transaction ten days later, the Mariners traded Santana with cash to the Indians, the Indians sent Encarnaci√≥n and a competitive balance draft pick to the Mariners, Yandy D√≠az and Cole Sulser to the Tampa Bay Rays, and the Rays traded Jake Bauers to Cleveland. Santana hit the 200th home run of his career on April 28, 2019, versus Wade Miley of the Houston Astros. Selected by fan voting in 2019 to his first career MLB All-Star Game, Santana was named the starting first baseman for the American League. He and Indians were hosts for the event played at Progressive Field and he batted cleanup. Santana also competed in the Home Run Derby. On August 11 versus the Minnesota Twins, he hit a game-winning grand slam in a 7‚Äì3 outcome to tie the Indians and Twins for first place. The following night, Santana hit a walk-off home run at Progressive Field to defeat the Boston Red Sox, 6‚Äì5, that allowed the Indians to reclaim sole possession of first place in the AL Central for the first time since the previous April. Through August 15, Santana homered five time times in the seventh inning or later to give the Indians a lead. Overall with the 2020 Cleveland Indians, Santana batted .199/.349/.350 with 8 home runs and 30 RBIs in 60 games, and led the American League in walks, with 47.https://www.mlb.com/player/carlos-santana-467793?stats=career-r-hitting- mlb&year;=2020 International career Santana represented the Dominican Republic national team at the World Baseball Classic in 2013 and 2017. They won the gold medal for the 2013 championship, defeating Puerto Rico 3‚Äì0 in the final. In the MLB Japan All-Star Series, he played for the United States in the 2014 and 2018 editions. Player profile Santana's monker is \\"Slamtana,\\" and he is also called \\"Axeman\\" and \\"El Oso.\\" He carries himself with a reserved demeanor, typically reticent to talk about his achievements and instead deflecting credit to his teammates. In 2019, Santana raised his batting average to above his career high by hitting the ball the other way more frequently. Until spring training of the 2019 season, Santana did not have an established routine, he stated. It was during that period that Indians assistant hitting coach Vic Rodriguez urged him to do so, because \\"if you have a consistent routine that works for you and you stick to it every day regardless of how good or bad a season you‚Äôre having, you‚Äôre going to be fine.\\" The approach was designed to hit the ball with more hard contact up the middle, rather than attempt to continuously pull it, helping to significantly improve in virtually every category. He maintained better focus and increased his ability to shorten slumps. Commented longtime teammates Francisco Lindor, \\"[h]e‚Äôs always been a good player, but his mental preparation is a lot better this year. ... [H]e would have just two at-bats [a game]. He would have two good at-bats and the rest, whatever. Now he has three to five good at-bats.\\" Third baseman Jos√© Ram√≠rez noticed a more relaxed approach. \\"When he was first with us, his attitude was different, especially when things weren‚Äôt going well for him, it was very different. He‚Äôs changed. He doesn‚Äôt worry as much. He works, he knows what he has to do. I think it‚Äôs maturity and time, too. Maybe he learned from the rough year he had in Philadelphia.\\" Santana wears the number 41 in honor of Victor Martinez, who is also a former switch-hitting catcher who started his career with the Cleveland Indians.

The same year, Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz appointed Aaron to a national panel to study the need for reinstating the Bracero Program in order to ease a national agricultural labor shortage.

Aaron invited prominent labor law scholars from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Germany and Italy to discuss each country's unique approach to labor and industrial relations. Over the next 12 years, the Comparative Labor Law Group produced three books and helped establish the legal discipline of comparative labor law in the United States. Due to his work in the field, Aaron became editor of the Comparative Labor Law and Policy Journal. Despite his advanced age, at the time of his death Aaron still served as Senior Editor of the publication. Aaron was also a strong critic of American labor law. He contended that most judges lack experience in how the modern workplace functions and the specialized nature of labor law, and advocated the creation of \\"labor courts\\" to adjudicate employer-union legal disputes. He also argued that the Taft- Hartley Act was deeply flawed, although union members' rights needed additional protection not offered under the National Labor Relations Act, Taft-Hartley, or the Landrum-Griffin Act.\\"Taft-Hartley Curbs Studied,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 11, 1948; Kennedy, \\"Analysis Set for New U.S. Labor Law,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 16, 1959; Kennedy, \\"Unions to Go Cautiously With New Labor Law,\\" Los Angeles Times, November 18, 1959. In an article in the Comparative Labor Law Journal in 1979, Aaron argued that the National Labor Relations Act failed to protect the rights of the vast majority of unorganized workers and advocated major reform of the act.\\"UCLA Group Makes Critical Report About Court Curbs on Labor Unions,\\" Los Angeles Times, February 19, 1951. Death Aaron continued to teach and write into his 90s. He died on August 25, 2007, at UCLA Medical Center from a cerebral hemorrhage suffered in a fall.

Frances married John Dandridge on July 22, 1730 in New Kent County, Virginia. Frances was the daughter of Orlando Jones and Martha Macon, prosperous Virginia landowners, and she is more commonly known as the mother of the first First Lady of the United States, Martha Washington. Politics runs in the family Frances' father, Orlando Jones, was a Burgess for New Kent County in 1718 in the House of Burgesses, the leading legislative body in Colonial Virginia. Her grandfather, Col. Gideon Macon (father of Martha Macon), was also a member of the House of Burgesses from 1696 to 1702, and was secretary to Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, during his second term in office. Upon Col. Macon's death in 1702, his widow, Martha Woodward Macon, married Captain Nathaniel West who was also a representative in the House of Burgesses. Captain Nathaniel West and Martha Woodward Macon West had two children. Their daughter, Unity West, married John Dandridge's brother, William Dandridge. William Dandridge was appointed to the Governor's Council in 1727, the highest political position available to colony residents. All of this would suggest that Frances, her husband, and children would have been quite familiar with colonial politics. Childhood Frances, or Fanny, was born on a plantation near Williamsburg on Queen's Creek within easy distance of the growing capital. Frances had an older brother, Lane Jones, born in 1707, and Frances was born in 1710. Her mother, Martha Macon Jones, died when Frances was only six years old. Orlando Jones soon remarried. His second wife, Mary Elizabeth William Jones, became the sole parent of the two children just three years later when Orlando Jones died. Orlando and Mary had no children together. A year later, Orlando's widow married John James Flourney and her stepchildren lived with them in Williamsburg. Mary Elizabeth William Jones Flourney was their guardian, and as such, could use the income from the Queen's Creek plantation to support the two stepchildren. The sister of the late Orlando Jones sued twice for custody of her niece and nephew, but was denied. When Lane Jones reached the age of eighteen, he legally emancipated himself and moved in with his aunt in Timson's Neck. Ten months later, when Frances was sixteen, she also sued for emancipation. She did not move in with her aunt, but instead lived with a planter in New Kent. Her mother's parents had been from that region and a number of Macon relatives lived there. Their Virginia home Shortly after Frances Jones married John Dandridge in New Kent County, Virginia on July 22, 1730, they moved to their new home, Chestnut Grove. John Dandridge became Clerk of Courts in New Kent and kept that position for the next 26 years. He was also vestryman and churchwarden for St. Peter's Church, Church of England. John was a prominent planter, and a Colonel in his military district. The Dandridges' home, Chestnut Grove, was on the bank of the Pamunkey River in New Kent County, Virginia. John's older brother, William Dandridge (1689‚Äì1743), lived on the opposite bank of the river with his wife Unity West Dandridge at their estate, Elsing Green, in King William County, Virginia. Chestnut Grove Plantation burned down in 1926, but its former site was only four miles from the location of New Kent's current County Courthouse. John and Frances Jones Dandridge also owned a house in Williamsburg and visited there frequently. The Dandridge children John and Frances Jones Dandridge produced eight children, Martha Dandridge being the eldest. As was typical of the time, the children were educated at home, their education being considered quite liberal. John and Frances employed a tutor for their children. It was also quite unusual that Martha was presented to society in Williamsburg at the young age of 15. Their daughter, Martha, first married Daniel Parke Custis. Following his death she later married George Washington and became First Lady of the United States of America. One of their sons, Bartholomew Dandridge, followed in his father's footsteps and became Clerk of Courts in New Kent County. And he, like his father, also served as both vestryman and churchwarden, but at the Blisland Parish rather than the St. Peter's Parish. * Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (2 Jun 1731 - 22 May 1802) * John Dandridge (1733‚Äì1749) * William Dandridge (1734‚Äì1776) * Bartholomew Dandridge (1737‚Äì1785) * Anna Maria \\"Fanny\\" Dandridge Bassett (1739‚Äì1777) * Frances Dandridge (1744‚Äì1757) * Elizabeth Dandridge Aylett Henley (1749‚Äì1800) * Mary Dandridge (1756‚Äì1763) Illegitimate children of John Dandridge: * Ann Dandridge Costin * Ralph Dandridge Later life Her husband, Colonel John Dandridge, died in Fredericksburg on 31 August 1756.

The game itself was released in two versions. One version of the game is the traditional Chinese version intended for players in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The other version uses the simplified version of the Chinese language and is intended for audiences in mainland China. Despite this minor difference, the story line of these two versions are identical. The ultimate goal of the game is to conquer all of ancient China (referred to in the game as the world) by defeating bandits and local rulers. Because it was an unlicensed game from Taiwan, it was never physically distributed outside of Asia. The player control the three warriors: Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. These legends of 2nd century China have the ability to cast magical spells on enemies like tigers, barbarians, and various kinds of bosses. There are no random encounters and all encounters are visible like in EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana. However, battles can be long and tricky like in other Chinese role-playing games like the Family Computer version of Final Fantasy VII. Gameplay Magic and combat Dozens of unique spells can be learned from scrolls that use the various elements of nature (wind, earth, fire, and water). Each character has to learn the spells individually with no spell sharing allowed. Spells are lost when the character that was holding them temporarily disappears from the party along with any armed weapon or armor that he was carrying. The equipment and spells are gained back right after the character re-joins the group. Symbols determine the effects of the spell. For example, a spell with an up arrow is a spell that increases the target's stats and a spell with a flame symbol on it is considered to be an attack spell (regardless of which element that spell actually belongs to). At the start of the game, a dying woman assigns the player the challenge of \\"conquering the world.\\" For every enemy encounter that the player overcomes in battle, the warriors gain gold pieces and experience points. The combat system and some of the music used in the game is borrowed from vintage Final Fantasy games such as Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IV. Shopping The various weapons that can be purchased in the game consist of swords, spears, and other melee weapons. Other necessities for the quest can be either purchased in town, dropped in battle by a defeated enemy, or found inside of treasure vases that are mysteriously placed inside the various dungeons of the game. A feature that is unique to this game is the option of purchasing war horses. Despite not counting as an item that can be used in the game, they increase the player's stats during battle. Saving/loading the game The player can save anywhere in the game except during battle and during cut scenes. Before and after saving the game, the screen shows the amount of time that elapsed since the beginning in hours, minutes, and seconds. The game can only hold up to 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds of elapsed save time (5999.4 minutes or 4.2 days) before not counting any more time. However, the player is never penalized if he doesn't beat the game within 100 hours of beginning a new game.

Her task was to carry stores, refrigerated items, and equipment to ships in the fleet, and to remote stations and staging areas.  Operational history  The second ship to be named Rigel by the Navy, AF-58 was laid down under Maritime Administration contract 15 March 1954 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Corp., Pascagoula, Mississippi; launched 15 March 1955; sponsored by Mrs. Austin K. Doyle; and commissioned 2 September 1955, Capt. W. T. Griffin in command. U.S. Navy (1955-1975) The first of a new class of high-speed, large-capacity, fully refrigerated stores issue ships, Rigel completed shakedown out of Newport, Rhode Island, and her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia. In February 1956, she sailed south for the first time; underwent further training in Cuban and Puerto Rican waters; and into the fall provided logistic support along the mid-Atlantic seaboard and in the Caribbean. In late fall (14 November-9 December), she completed her first U.S. 6th Fleet deployment which included her initiation in her primary mission - replenishment at sea. USS Rigel (AF-58), circa 1958. During the winter of 1957, she spent 2 months in the Caribbean, then sailed east, in May, for 4 months in the Mediterranean. January 1958 brought a return to the Caribbean, followed in March by the initiation of a regular schedule of 6-week replenishment deployments to the Mediterranean with intervening periods spent in loading, upkeep, training, and shipyard overhauls. On her second and third deployments of that year, she directly supported units of the U.S. 6th Fleet sent to Lebanon at the request of that country's president. Rigel maintained her regular Mediterranean logistic deployment schedule through the 1960s. Interruptions came with the replenishment of units engaged in good will visits to West Africa (January 1961); exercises off Iceland and Canada (June 1962, June 1965); and crises in the Caribbean - the Cuban Missile Crisis in November 1962 and the Dominican Republic crisis in May 1965. Rigel was fitted out with an amidships helicopter platform in 1961, thus providing her with a vertical replenishment capability. Two years later, that platform was replaced with one on her fantail to simplify the pilots' problems when landing aboard or conducting replenishments. Rigel served until decommissioned on 23 June 1975. Military Sealift Command (1975-1992) Rigel was placed in service by the Military Sealift Command (MSC) as USNS Rigel (T-AF-58), 23 June 1975. She continued operating with the MSC, resupplying U.S. Navy ships until 1992.  Decommissioning and fate (1992-2008) Rigel was struck from the Navy list on 16 May 1994, and was transferred to the Maritime Administration. She was laid up in the James River Reserve Fleet on 1 April 1998 off Fort Eustis, Virginia (USA). In 2008, she was finally sold to All Star Metals for $469,626 and scrapped in Brownsville, Texas (USA).

In 1935, he was briefly imprisoned for his activities in support of the PCR. During World War II, Vincze was in Bucharest, becoming involved in activities against the fascist regime of Ion Antonescu (see Romania during World War II). By then, he was already in a relationship with Constan»õa CrƒÉciun, and allegations later surfaced that she was unsuccessfully courted by the PCR general secretary, ≈ûtefan Fori≈ü. Lavinia Betea, \\"Comunism - Dragostea ≈üi revolu≈£ia\\", in Jurnalul Na≈£ional, June 15, 2005; retrieved September 1, 2007 On November 19, 1942, a military tribunal in the city condemned him to hard labour for life, having found that > \\"He was part of the central leadership of the Communist Party of Romania, > being tasked with the indoctrination of the capital's young people.

Petre Pandrea, a PCR activist who was not arrested, visited him and CrƒÉciun, and later recounted that both detainees had been bastinadoed by the authorities during interrogations. Pandrea also left detail on the couple's wedding in custody, indicating that he and his acquaintance, the Roman Catholic cleric Vladimir Ghika, were their godparents. Later in their life, both Ghika and Pandrea were to be incarcerated by the Romanian communist regime.

Gratitude is a > rare flower. I have forgiven them and I do not forget.\\" Released after the King Michael Coup of August 1944, Vincze held a number of positions in the PCR (which soon after became the Romanian Workers' Party, PMR). His name came up in 1944‚Äì1946, when Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and his inner-PCR faction succeeded in toppling, kidnapping, and ultimately killing their rival Fori»ô. Among the informal charges brought against Fori»ô was his alleged attempt to seduce CrƒÉciun during the war years, when she considered herself engaged to Vincze, and of having thus caused her a nervous breakdown which, it was argued, had facilitated her capture by the authorities. During the period, Vincze was close to the Ana Pauker-Vasile Luca-Teohari Georgescu faction, which competed with Gheorghiu-Dej's grouping.TismƒÉneanu, p.167 According to politician Gy√°rf√°s Kurk√≥, Vincze and Luca secretly oversaw the absorption of smaller Hungarian groups into the new Hungarian People's Union, a mass organisation which was to function as a close associate of the PMR.

According to Anton Ra»õiu and Nicolae Betea, two of PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu's collaborators, the results in that constituency were forged by a group of 40 people (including Belu Zilber and Anton Golopen≈£ia). They stated that the president of the county electoral commission collected the votes from local stations and was required to read them aloud -- irrespective of the option expressed, he called out the names of the Bloc's candidates. Nicolae Betea also indicated that the overall results for the Bloc of Democratic Parties in Arad County, officially recorded at 58%, were closer to 20%. A supplementary member of the PMR Central Committee from February 24, 1948 to December 28, 1955, he was Minister of Forestry in the Petru Groza cabinet, from April 14, 1948 to November 23, 1949. He was subsequently appointed Romania's Ambassador to the People's Republic of Hungary, at a time when the Hungarian communist politician L√°szl√≥ Rajk was being purged by his rival M√°ty√°s R√°kosi. According to journalist P√°l Bodor, Vincze organized secret meetings between R√°kosi and the emerging Romanian leader, Gheorghiu- Dej, which took place in Romania's Bihor County. As a result of these, Gheorghiu-Dej and R√°kosi agreed that the Romanian leadership was to arrest and prosecute various ethnic Hungarians who were charged with having supported Rajk's policies. Among these were Gy√†rf√°s Kurk√≥; √Åron M√°rton, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Alba Iulia; the urban planner Gy√∂rgy Sebesty√©n; and the academics J√≥zsef M√©liusz, Lajos Cs√∂g√∂r and Edg√°r Balogh. P√°l Bodor believes that Vincze may have played a personal part in the purge. Vincze returned to Romania soon after, and was Minister of Food Industry from November 23, 1949 to December 15, 1950. He was elected as a deputy to the Great National Assembly for the Timi»ôoara-Nord seat in Timi»ôoara Region, and served in that body from 1952 to 1957. In late May 1952, when Luca's fall from power signaled his group's defeat by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and his partisans, Vincze was noted for abruptly ending his association with Pauker. With Alexandru Moghioro≈ü, Iosif Ranghe≈£, Gheorghe Stoica and others, he attacked Luca's policies in public, leading to his demotion and subsequent arrest. \\"Capitolul I. Partidul Comunist Rom√¢n\\" , in Final Report of the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania (hosted by Cotidianul); retrieved September 1, 2007 He became deputy minister at the Ministry of Internal Affairs after May 28, 1952, under Premiers Groza and Gheorghiu-Dej. Promoted to the rank of Major General (general-maior) in the Romanian Armed Forces in June 1952, he also served as chief of the Administrative Section of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party until January 24, 1956. Ion Vincze was vice-president of the Party Control Commission between December 28, 1955 and July 24, 1965. At the time, the body was led by Dumitru Coliu, who, together with Vincze, engineered a series of inner-PMR inquiries and investigations that relied on denunciations.TismƒÉneanu, p.191 This came in the wake of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, after criticism of Gheorghiu-Dej had been voiced at home (notably, by Miron Constantinescu and Iosif Chi≈üinevschi).TismƒÉneanu, p.191, 293 During that period, Coliu, Vincze, Petre BorilƒÉ and Gheorghe Stoica ordered the Securitate to carry out arrests and organise repressive actions.TismƒÉneanu, p.293 Alongside Gheorghe Apostol, Constantin P√Ærvulescu, Moghioro»ô and BorilƒÉ, Vincze was Gheorghiu-Dej's emissary during renewed discussions with Pauker, when they attempted to make her admit that she was guilty of \\"deviationism\\".TismƒÉneanu, p.301, 333 In 1968, when the new leadership around Nicolae Ceau≈üescu offered concessions to ethnic Hungarian intellectuals, it created a Council of Working People of Magyar Nationality, of which Vincze was named vice-president. Upon selection, he reportedly announced to the community that he was \\"returning to the womb\\". Vincze was also vice-president of the Central Party College from July 24, 1965 to August 12, 1969 and a member of the National Council of Romanian Radio and Television from March 8, 1971. He died in Bucharest.

Specifically, it refers to the process or algorithm used to select which line will receive the call. Hunt groups are supported by some PBX phone systems. Also, some phone companies will provide this feature for a small fee (see also: Centrex). In the tariffs of some telephone companies, one may obtain hunting for free, but forward on busy is a charged service. Multi-line hunting Multiline hunting (sometimes MLH, line hunting or MHG, multiline hunting group) is a feature that allows multiple telephone lines going into a business to act as a single group, called a hunt group. This type of fallback is a somewhat more complex form of call forwarding. If the line called is busy, the call goes to the next available line. Only if no lines in the group are open does the calling party get a busy signal. Linear hunting In linear hunting, calls are always delivered to the lowest-numbered available line. This is also referred to as serial hunting or terminal hunting. It resembles busy/no-answer call forwarding. Calls are always delivered to the first line, unless it is busy ‚Äî then the second, third, and remaining lines are considered in succession. This configuration is most often found on multi- line phones found at small businesses. For automatic call distributor systems with high call volumes, this is usually the least preferable method, because calls will arrive at destinations that are in the process of completing the previous call, and depending on the circumstances, may be the least prepared to take the call. Linear hunting can also cause problems in automated equipment that answers calls, particularly if a destination extension fails on a lower-numbered line. This extension will disrupt a disproportionately high percentage of the incoming calls, whereas circular hunting will spread that disruption evenly throughout all the calls, minimizing the possibility for a major disruption. Circular hunting In circular hunting, the calls are distributed \\"round-robin\\". If a call is delivered to line 1, the next call goes to 2, the next to 3. The succession throughout each of the lines continues even if one of the previous lines becomes free. When the end of the hunt group is reached, the hunting starts over at the first line. Lines are skipped only if they are still busy on a previous call. Circular hunting is a good way to distribute calls to electronic answering equipment such as fax machines. Louisiana State University Office of Telecommunications, Station Hunting description, retrieved September 2007 Most-idle hunting In most- idle hunting, calls are always delivered to whichever line has been idle the longest. This considers the length of time that the calltaker has been busy versus available. This is typically used in call centers where the calls are being answered by people, to distribute the load evenly.

In 1797 he received his doctorate from the University of G√∂ttingen, and later worked as a physician at the clinical institute in Braunschweig. For a short period of time he was a professor of medicine at the Universities of Wittenberg (1804) and Erlangen (1805), and in 1806 went to work at the medical hospital at the Charit√© in Berlin. One of his well-known students was Moritz Heinrich Romberg (1795‚Äì1873). Horn is considered the first practicing psychiatrist at the Charit√©. In the early 19th century, psychology as a scientific discipline was in its infancy, and barbaric, coercive methods were generally used to treat mental patients. Horn believed that mental illness was largely due to physical suffering, and used an assortment of mechanical devices for therapeutic purposes. He extensively used centrifugal devices such as the \\"rotating bed\\" and \\"rotating chair\\" for treatment of hysteria at the Charit√©, and reportedly believed that his patients derived benefits from such practices. In 1803 Horn published a practical textbook on pharmaceuticals titled Handbuch der praktischen Arzneimittellehre f√ºr √Ñrzte und Wund√§rzte. He is also credited for providing an early description of tabes dorsalis.

He became known as Ildefonso as a Benedictine monk and served as an abbot prior to his elevation to the cardinalate. He led the Milanese archdiocese during World War II and was known to have supported Fascism at first. But his views changed to opposition after the annexation of Austria and the introduction of racial laws prompting vocal criticisms of anti-Christian aspects of the Mussolini regime. His beatification was celebrated in mid-1996 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Childhood and priesthood Alfredo Ludovico Schuster was born in 1880 in the Ospedale Santissimo Salvatore in Rome to Johann Schuster (a Bavarian tailor and double widower) and Maria Anna Tutzer (who hailed from Bolzano). Johann was three decades older than Tutzer. His sister Giulia entered the Vincentians as a nun. He also had three half- siblings from his father's second marriage. Schuster was baptized on 20 January as \\"Alfredo Ludovico Luigi\\". In his childhood he was kidnapped for a brief period but the kidnapper was arrested. Schuster received his Confirmation on 2 April 1887 from Monsignor Giulio Lenti and made his First Communion on Pentecost 1890 in the Santa Anna in Porta Angelica church. His father Johann died on 18 September 1889. He served as an altar server at the Santa Maria della Piet√† in Camposanto dei Teutonici church next to Saint Peter's Basilica. Schuster completed his high school studies (ginnasiali and liceali) at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in November 1891. On 13 November 1898 he joined the Order of Saint Benedict at their novitiate at Saint Paul Outside the Walls when he took the name Ildefonso. He later professed his monastic vows on 13 November 1900. He graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy on 14 June 1903 and later received a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Atheneum of Saint Anselm in Rome. Schuster received his ordination as a priest on 19 March 1904 at the patriarchal Lateran Basilica in Rome from Cardinal Pietro Respighi (its archpriest). He returned to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in 1904. His two mentors during his time of education were Father Bonifacio Oslander and Tommaso Riccardi. Abbotship He became the novice master in 1908 and prior in 1916 before he was elected as the abbot for Saint Paul Outside the Walls on 6 April 1918. He also received the abbatial blessing from Cardinal Basilio Pompili on 14 April there. He served as the Procurator General for the Cassinese Congregation from 1914 to 1929 and also served as the President of the Pontifical Oriental Institute from 1919 to 1922. He visited the seminaries of the northern Lombard region as well as those in the southern regions of Campania and Calabria from 1924 to 1928. Either in November or December 1926 he preached the spiritual exercises to Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (the future Pope John XXIII) at Saint Paul Outside the Walls. While abbot he was made a consulter to the Congregation for Rites and the Congregation for the Oriental Churches. Episcopate and cardinalate Schuster was named Archbishop of Milan on 26 June 1929 to succeed Eugenio Tosi. On the following 13 July he took the oath of allegiance to the Italian state in front of King Vittorio Emmanuele III; he was the first Italian bishop to do this since the new Lateran Concordat required it according to Article 20 of the concordat. Pope Pius XI elevated Schuster to the cardinalate in 1929 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti. Carlo Cremonesi and Agostino Zampini served as the co-consecrators. In 1933 he was conferred as a bailiff grand cross of honor and devotion to the Order of Malta.Stroebel, James-Michael von, \\"Blessed Alfredo Ildefonso Cardinal Schuster, OSB\\", Order of Malta American Association Schuster ordained 1265 priests and consecrated 22 bishops during his tenure as archbishop. He also made five pastoral visits during his episcopate and selected Saint Carlo Borromeo as his model as an archbishop. He emphasized the importance of catechetics and promoted the Catholic Action movement for the faithful. He also believed that the goal of all Christians was holiness. He served as a papal legate on several occasions. On 15 August 1932 he was appointed as the legate to the celebration of Nostra Signora di Caravaggio; on 21 March 1934 to the millennial commemorations of the Einsiedeln convent in Switzerland; on 15 September 1937 to the inauguration of the new facade of the cathedral of Desio; and on 2 August 1951 to the National Eucharistic Conference in Assisi. He participated in the papal conclave in 1939 which elected Pope Pius XII on the eve of World War II and was even considered as a papabile candidate for those seeking a more pastoral pope. Death Schuster's tomb in the Cathedral of Milan. He died on 30 August 1954 at 4:15am of a heart ailment in at Venegono Inferiore near Milan. Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (the future Pope John XXIII) celebrated his funeral. He was buried on 2 September 1954 in the metropolitan cathedral next to his two immediate predecessors. His tomb was opened on 28 January 1985 and his remains were found to be intact. Honours * 50px Schuster was honoured with the Order of the Holy Sepulchre * 50px In 1933 the cardinal was conferred the honour of Bailiff Knight Grand Cross of Honor and Devotion of the Order of Malta. Relations with Fascism There were claims during the process for Schuster's beatification that he was supportive to Italian Fascism. While there is evidence of some support for fascist ambitions, there is also evidence that he denounced the anti-Christian element of fascism. It was said that he refused to participate in ceremonies involving Mussolini and also condemned racist legislation during the fascist period. Schuster was an enthusiastic supporter of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 and compared it to the Crusades and viewed it as a potential source of converts. On 28 October 1935, while celebrating Mass in the Cathedral of Milan, he asked God to protect the Italian troops as \\"they open the door of Ethiopia to the Catholic faith and Roman civilisation\\"P. Beltrame Quattrocchi, Al di sopra del gagliardetti. L'arcivescovo Schuster: un asceta benedettino nell'era fascista, Marietti, Casale Monferrato (1985), s.v. \\"Etiopia\\". before he blessed the banners of the departing troops. In a speech at the School of Fascist Mystique in Rome in 1937, he spelled out a fanciful direct link between Imperial Rome and Christian Rome to fascism: \\"God has chosen to reward the Duce by drawing his historical figure closer to the great spirits of Constantine and Augustus, through the work of Benito Mussolini reconnecting Rome and its King to a shining new imperial crown of Roman peace\\". In 1938, his views changed by Germany annexing Austria and introducing German racial doctrines with the Italian Racial Laws.E. Nobili, La parabola di un'illusione. Il cardinale Schuster dalla guerra d'Etiopia alle leggi razziali, NED, Milan (2005), s.v. \\"Leggi razziali\\". Relationship with Mussolini The Fascist and Nazi press attacked Schuster during the war, without his suffering loss of esteem among his own flock in Milan. On 25 April 1945, the cardinal hosted in the archbishop's palace in Milan a meeting between Italian partisans and Mussolini in an attempt to obtain a truce between the two parties. However, Mussolini did not accept the demand for unconditional surrender that Marazza and Pertini, the partisan delegates, made. Mussolini arrived on time at 4:00pm without the other side being present. The delegates Cadorna and Lombardi as well as Marazza arrived an hour later. Mussolini had a talk with Schuster in the meantime, who gave him a glass of rosolio to drink and a copy of a book he had written about the life of a saint. Schuster made an effort to preach humility to Mussolini. Once Graziani and the other Fascist leaders arrived (according to the versions given according to all those present including Schuster), events that occurred differ according to the individuals versions of events.P. Beltrame Quattrocchi, Al di sopra del gagliardetti. L'arcivescovo Schuster: un asceta benedettino nell'era fascista, Marietti, Casale Monferrato (1985). Although the cardinal sought Mussolini out on 25 April 1945 and urged him to make his peace with God and his fellow man, Mussolini spurned the admonition and was killed within a week. Following the end of the war, cardinal made frequent attempts to emphasize the danger of totalitarianism that communism and fascism inspired.T. Leccisotti, Il cardinale Schuster, S. Benedetto (1969), Vol.II. Beatification Monument in Verano Brianza. The process for his beatification opened in Milan in a diocesan process that his successor inaugurated on 30 August 1957; the process was closed on 31 October 1963 after a process was held in Rome from 21 November 1959 to 13 July 1961 to collect additional evidence and documentation. His writings were approved on 5 March 1970 as having adhered to traditional doctrine. The cause remained dormant for some time until 18 July 1986 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the diocesan phase while later receiving the Positio for assessment in 1989. Theologians approved the cause on 12 October 1993 as did the C.C.S. members later on 11 January 1994. Pope John Paul II confirmed that Schuster had led a life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable on 26 March 1994. Schuster's beatification now depended upon one confirmed miracle. One such case was investigated with the evidence collected sent to Rome with the C.C.S. validating this process on 5 July 1985. Medical experts confirmed this miracle as such a decade later on 17 November 1994 while theologians confirmed the assessment on 21 February 1995; the C.C.S. also approved it on 2 May 1995. John Paul II confirmed that the healing in question was a miracle on 11 July 1995 and confirmed Schuster's beatification. The beatification was celebrated on 12 May 1996 in Saint Peter's Square. The miracle that led to his beatification was the cure of the nun Maria Emilia Brusati from a severe glaucoma.

Originally opened in 1960 by Omaha's Brandeis department store, the mall has been home to several major chains, including Sears, Target and Dillard's before the store closed in 2008. Most of the mall is expected to be demolished in the near future and replaced with a new mixed-use development. History Beginnings In the late 1950s, Brandeis Investment Co., the real estate division of the local Brandeis department store, obtained a 96-year lease on land at the northwest corner of 72nd and Dodge streets for a new shopping center.\\"Crossroads is dean of area malls,\\" Omaha World-Herald, April 29, 2004 Construction started in September 1959., and the mall opened in September 1960 as \\"Crossroads Shopping Center\\", a single-story straight shot connector between the two anchor stores: Sears at the west and Brandeis at the east. Both Sears and Brandeis were 3 stories: the first floor of each is actually the basement level of the mall, but had exterior access for the anchors; the second floor (originally called the \\"Arcade Level\\") opens into the mall; there was no mall or exterior access to the third floor of either anchor store. The membrane tents over the food court of Crossroads Mall, as seen from the top floor of the parking garage. The tents have become an icon in the Omaha area over the past 20 years. Renovation Melvin Simon & Associates purchased the mall in 1984. A $35 million renovation project began in 1986 and was completed in 1988. The renovation created a new 2-story center court with a unique white membrane \\"tent\\" roof extending far above the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor of the center court housed the food court. A new wing running perpendicular to the original corridor to the north added 2 floors of retail space with Dillard's as a new anchor at the north end. William Dillard, the founder and president of the Dillard's chain was present at the opening of the store at Crossroads. A new single-story wing extends south from the center court and ends at a large glass-enclosed main entrance. The renovation also added a 6-story parking structure on the northeast corner of the property, which connects to the 2nd floor of the new north wing, to the 2nd and 3rd floors of the new Dillard's store, and originally connected to the 3rd floor of the existing Younkers store, all via enclosed skywalks. Unlike the original anchors, the first and second floors of Dillard's match up with the first and second floors of the mall. The entire mall was refurbished during the renovation, updated with a bold new red, blue, and gray color scheme and new neon lighting. Also around the same time as this renovation, Sears added a passenger elevator, where previously only escalators had been available to customers. Second Renovation In 1998, the mall underwent a smaller, mostly cosmetic remodel in which the color scheme and furnishings were updated to more neutral colors. New directional signage was added in the mall and the parking garage, and a large lighted \\"FOOD COURT\\" sign was added over the escalator leading up to the food court. Spaces of two former food court tenants were combined and remodeled to provide additional seating, small children's rides, and a family restroom. The main south entrance was also updated with a new \\"compass\\" logo, new logotype, and faux windows above the existing windows. 2005-2013 In early 2005, Younkers closed its store, and the building was demolished to make way for a new Target store which opened in July, 2006. Despite speculation that the new Target would be two floors like some of its other urban locations (such as downtown Minneapolis), the new store has one level of retail space with entrances to the south surface parking lot and into the mall. The receiving and storage areas for the store are on a separate level below the retail space and not accessible to customers. Unlike the former Younkers space, the Target store is not connected to the parking garage. Instead, the skywalk that used to open into Younkers now leads to a new stairway down to the mall level in an expanded entrance north of Target's mall entrance. In December, 2007, Dillard's announced that its Crossroads store would become a Dillard's Clearance Center, selling clearance merchandise from area Dillard's stores and other lower-priced items. The Dillard's anchor was closed in August 2008. By the spring of 2009, the entire second level, including the food court, had become completely vacant. Currently, the mall is struggling. The larger Westroads (less than three miles (5 km) away) and Oak View Malls, as well as the \\"lifestyle centers\\" Village Pointe and Shadow Lake are drawing customers away from Crossroads. Nearly 50 percent of the mall is vacant. In mid-June 2009, Simon Malls announced that Crossroads was for sale. Simon did not announce the price of the property, however in 2002, the mall was appraised at approximately $57 million. Ideas for redevelopment of Crossroads include a complex for residential and commercial. Having received several bids for the mall that were deemed too low, Simon Property Group defaulted on their mortgage payments, sending the mall into foreclosure. A foreclosure sale by the lender was scheduled on March 4, 2010. The mall changed hands that March, going to CW Capital for $40.6 million, who turned around and sold it in June 2010 for an undisclosed amount. Century Development is the current owner, who displayed a strong concern for taking the mall in the right direction for Omaha. Two of the malls bays on the East wing next to Target have been occupied by Restoration Church. Crossroads Mall also houses many small unique businesses like Sissy's Bags Boutique, ReJenerations, Stella's, Dragon Storm Kempo Karate, Pro Nails, Battle Bears, D&B; Auction House, Diverse Cutz Barber Shop, Fairytail Costumes, and Wireless Solutions. It also has a few chain stores like Barnes & Noble, . Present As of February 2016, both Foot Locker and Finish Line, Inc. have closed, with Restoration Church having moved to the latter's bay. Other bays around the mall have since become occupied by new tenants, including: Fairytail Costumes and Rental, Diverse Cutz, Cinderella's Closet, 1/2 of 1/2 Name Brand Clothing, Om Eyebrow Threading, The Czech and Slovak Educational Center and Museum, The Great Plains Black History Museum, PART (Performing Artists Repertory Theatre), and Pishon Boutique. The Mall also hosts semi-annual events like \\"Nebraska's Largest Indoor Garage Sale,\\" Take 2 Kids Consignment, and AARP Tax Services. The third level of the Sears store has been closed off. In 2016, Target permanently sealed off their mall entrance. Century Development has stated it wants to begin demolition on the mall‚Äîexcept for Target and a parking garage, but including a parcel to the west of the mall most recently occupied by Best Buy to make way for a mixed-use development to be called Crossroads Village. The developers planned to seek tax incentives though the Nebraska Legislature; however, as of 2018, none of this has come to fruition. On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing in March 2019 as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide which left Target as the only anchor left. The mall is now closed as of September 2020. Design Crossroads is an enclosed mall with 2 levels of retail space. A third level (basement) houses the mall management office. The mall features a 2nd level food court that overlooks the center court and is housed under a unique large white membrane \\"tent\\" with 2 peaks. However, the food court is closed and no stores are open on the second floor, so this floor has been closed. The north wing has large skylights running the entire length of the corridor, while the east, west, and south wings do not have natural lighting.

The show was hosted by MTV VJs Downtown Julie Brown, Carolyne Heldman, Kevin Seal, Michael Tomioka, and Dweezil Zappa, and it took place at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. This year featured the debut of the award for Best Video from a Film, which recognized the most outstanding video of a song taken from a movie soundtrack. Concurrently, 1987 also saw the elimination of the Special Recognition award that had been given out every year since 1984. Unlike Video Vanguard, which could go a few years without being handed out and then return, the Special Recognition award was never again given out at the VMAs. Peter Gabriel received a record-setting ten awards, including Video of the Year and the Video Vanguard award. Gabriel's video for \\"Sledgehammer\\" earned nine awards out of the ten it was in the running for, making it the most nominated video of the night, as well as the most rewarded video in VMA history. Gabriel also set a record for the most VMA nominations in a single year, as along with the ten nominations for \\"Sledgehammer\\", his video for \\"Big Time\\" also received two, bringing his total up to twelve nominations in 1987. This record would go uncontested until 2010, when Lady Gaga received thirteen nominations. The ceremony's other major nominees were fellow Video of the Year nominees Genesis, Paul Simon, Steve Winwood, and U2, as well as two-time Best Female Video nominee Madonna. Genesis, Winwood, and U2 all received seven nominations for their videos \\"Land of Confusion\\", \\"Higher Love\\", and \\"With or Without You\\", respectively. Meanwhile, Simon and Madonna split their six nominations: the former between \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" and \\"You Can Call Me Al\\", and the latter between \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart.\\" Nominations Winners are in bold text.

The county comprised its current area and all of what became Madera County and parts of what are today San Benito, Tulare, Kings, Inyo, and Mono counties. Millerton, was located along the Stockton - Los Angeles Road on the south bank of the free-flowing San Joaquin River and close to Fort Miller. McCray's Ferry on the north bank of the river was the means for crossing the river at that point. Millerton became the county seat of Fresno County after becoming a focal point of commerce and mail delivery for settlers in the lower San Joaquin Valley. The town began its decline when the San Joaquin River flooded on Christmas Eve, 1867, inundating Millerton. Some residents rebuilt, others moved. In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station for its new Southern Pacific line near a farm then owned by Anthony Easterby bounded by the present Chestnut, Belmont, Clovis and California avenues. Soon there was a store and around which grew the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno. Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Two years after the station was established, in 1874, county residents voted to move the county seat from Millerton to Fresno. The vote totals were Fresno 417; Lisbon 124; Centerville 123; Millerton 93. Millerton was eventually abandoned as a result. When the Friant Dam was completed in 1944, the site of Millerton became inundated by the waters of Millerton Lake. In extreme droughts, when the reservoir shrinks, ruins of the original county seat can still be observed. The ZIP Code is 93623. The community is inside area code 559.

James Otis Kaler (March 19, 1848 ‚Äî December 11, 1912) was an American journalist and author of children‚Äôs literature. He wrote under the name James Otis. Life and career Kaler was born on March 19, 1848, in Winterport, Maine. He attended public schools, then got a job with the Boston Journal at 13, and three years later was providing coverage of the American Civil War. Later, he went on to work as a journalist or editor for various newspapers, superintendent at schools, and a publicity man at a circus.Lost Classic Books Author Bio Page, James Otis (last accessed 1 September 2007) In 1880 he wrote his first, and still most famous (largely by way of a filmed version by Walt Disney), children‚Äôs book, Toby Tyler; or, Ten Weeks with a Circus, a story about an orphan who runs away to join the circus. Following the book's success he went on to author numerous other children‚Äôs books, mostly historical and adventure novels. Like most writers of his era, he was astonishingly prolific, and a total of nearly 200 books by him have been identified. Most were signed with the Otis name, but he also used the pen names Walter Morris, Lt. James K. Orton, Harry Prentice, and Amy Prentice. (Some scholars believe that the latter books, which were aimed at a younger audience than most of his works, were in fact penned by his wife.) After spending several years in the southeastern states, he returned to Maine in 1898 to become the first superintendent of schools in South Portland.South Portland Public, James Otis Kaler Collection . (last accessed 1 September 2007) A school named in his honor still stands in that city. He married Amy L. Scamman on March 19 of that year, and they had two sons, Stephen and Otis.

Students are given appropriate accommodations so that they receive full access to a general education curriculum.  History  Founded in 1973, the Child School began in Maari's apartment building on Roosevelt Island. Maari began to teach children with learning disabilities using her own curriculum which was tailored to each of her students. Eventually, the apartment was converted into a school and more students began to attend. In 1973, the Child School was formed, and in 1979, the Child School was moved to Manhattan. In 1981, a Middle School was added to address the needs of middle schoolers with learning disabilities. In 1996, a high school was added and the Child School was renamed The Child School/Legacy High School. The first graduating class from the high school graduated in 2001. In 2010 Maari De Souza was replaced by Sal Ferrera as the executive director of The Child School/Legacy High School. In 2013, Sal Fererra abruptly resigned for an undisclosed reason. Soon after he resigned from the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation [RIOC] as well. The Executive Director position is now held by Vishu Grover.  Return to Roosevelt Island  In 2003, The Child School returned to Roosevelt Island. Upon its return, the school moved into four separate buildings: an elementary school, a middle school, the Island House, and the Patterson House. The four new building were less crowded, allowing more individual attention and cleaner class rooms. The Island House includes a science lab with state-of-the-art equipment and a flat-screen television. There are also three computer labs.  Elementary school  Established in 1973, the Elementary School educates students from grades K-6. The elementary school has an art room, and a garden. Courses in the elementary school range from motor skills to Mathematics, to Technology and more. In the garden, students plant organic fruits and vegetables. There is park near the school, and sometimes classes are conducted there. Also, students of the elementary and middle schools go on other educational field trips.  Middle school  Initiated in 1991, the Middle School educates students in grades 7-8. The over-arching purpose is to promote learning, to meet the unique needs of early adolescents, and to support a successful transition to high school. There is one teacher and teacher assistant for every twelve students (12:1:1).  Legacy High School  Established in 1996, Legacy High School educates students, grades 9-12, with learning disabilities. Legacy is one of the few state approved non-public high schools in New York City.

She married the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Amasis II. When Amasis died in 526 BC, she returned from Egypt back to Cyrene.  Family  Ladice was the daughter of the fifth Greek Cyrenaean king Battus III and Greek Cyrenaean queen Pheretima. Her brother would be the future sixth Greek Cyrenaean king Arcesilaus III. Although her maternal grandparents are unknown, her paternal grandparents were the fourth Greek Cyrenaean king Arcesilaus II and Greek Cyrenaean queen Eryxo. Although her father is considered to have been Battus III, Herodotus suggests that from other accounts her father could have been Arcesilaus II or Critobulus, one of the leading Greek Cyrenaean citizens. She was born and raised in Cyrene. Marriage After 548 BC, she married pharaoh Amasis II as his fourth wife. Before Ladice's marriage with Amasis took place, her father made an alliance with the pharaoh to protect Cyrenaica from the local Libyan population and its aristocracy. Amasis, as a token of his goodwill and friendship with Battus, wanted to marry a Greek woman from Cyrenaica and Battus allowed him to select any woman whom he wanted to marry. Amasis chose Battus' daughter Ladice. Ladice and Amasis married in Cyrene. When Ladice married Amasis, she became a member of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Ladice is not well known in ancient Egyptian history and her name has not been found on any monuments from the time. Nor is she mentioned on any Egyptian inscriptions from the period. However, her marriage to Amasis encouraged cultural and trade interactions between Egypt and its neighbours in the Mediterranean. According to Herodotus, it was said that when Amasis and Ladice returned to his palace in Sais, Egypt, their marriage, for a while, was not consummated. Every time Amasis went to bed with Ladice, he was unable to have intercourse with her, although he did with his other wives. Amasis thought that Ladice might have had bewitched him and accused Ladice with bewitching him. If she was found guilty, the punishment would have been the death penalty. She denied the charge, but to no effect. So Ladice made a silent prayer to the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. If Aphrodite could save her life and her marriage, she would dedicate a statue to her in Cyrene. The goddess answered her prayer and her marriage was consummated and the pharaoh fell deeply in love with her. Amasis withdrew his accusation against Ladice. Ladice ordered a statue to be made in the image of Aphrodite and she sent the statue to Cyrene, where it was placed looking outward from the city. The statue was still there in the time of Herodotus.  Stepsons  It is unknown whether Ladice and Amasis had any children. However, through her marriage to the pharaoh, Ladice had two stepsons as Amasis had two sons, a child each from his first and third wives. These sons were prince Amose and his younger half brother, the son of queen Tentkheta, who later became the last pharaoh of the dynasty, Psamtik III. Return to Cyrene When Amasis died in 526 BC, Psamtik III became pharaoh and ruled until 525 BC, when king Cambyses II of Persia conquered Egypt. When Cambyses discovered who Ladice was, he sent her safely from Egypt back to Cyrene. After her return to Cyrene, no more is known about Ladice.

The head of the party was Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, but its most resourceful leader was Nawaz Sharif, a young industrialist whom Zia ul-Haq had appointed chief minister of Punjab. Sharif was vying for control of the Pakistan Muslim League, which was headed at that time by former Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo.Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military by Husain Haqqani, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2005, pp. 202‚Äì203. It won only fifty-three seats in the National Assembly, compared with ninety-two won by the PPP. Most IJI seats were won in Punjab. Nawaz Sharif emerged from the 1988 elections as the most powerful politician outside the PPP. In December 1988, he succeeded in forming an IJI administration in Punjab and became the province's chief minister. It was from this power base that he waged the political battles that eventually led to his becoming prime minister in 1990. In the supercharged atmosphere of the 1990 elections, the electorate surprised observers. Neither the IJI nor the PPP was expected to come up with a firm mandate to rule. Yet the IJI received a strong mandate to govern, winning 105 seats versus forty- five seats for the Pakistan Democratic Alliance (PDA), of which the PPP was the main component in the National Assembly.Profile: Islami Jamhoori Ittehad U.S. Library of Congress Opposition groups alleged large scale selective rigging of seats to not just ensure an IJI victory but also prevent those opposed to Military influence from being elected.How an election was stolen: the PDA white paper on the Pakistan elections (1990) Peoples Democratic Alliance In the 1993 national elections, the IJI coalition no longer existed to bring together all the anti-PPP forces.

This is the time when many Acacia species (commonly called wattles in Australia), are in flower. So, people wear a sprig of the flowers and leaves to celebrate the day. Although the national floral emblem of Australia is a particular species, named the golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha), any acacia can be worn to celebrate the day. The day was originally intended to promote patriotism for the new nation of Australia: > \\"Wattle Days emerged to prominence in Australia in the early years of the > federated nation. They took on some of the national and civic > responsibilities for children that [the more formal] Australia Day could > not.\\" - Libby RobinRobin, L 2002, ‚ÄòNationalising nature: wattle days in > Australia‚Äô, Journal of Australian Studies, 26, 73, pp. 13-26.  Tasmanian origin, 1838  Black wattle Acacia mearnsii On 1 December 1838, the first Hobart Town Anniversary Regatta was held in Hobart, Tasmania to celebrate the Anniversary of the 17th-century European discovery of the island by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. It was estimated between 5000 - 6000 people attended. On 10 August 1853 in Launceston, during 'Cessation of Transportation Celebrations' the procession marched under a triumphal arch decorated with wattle blossom. It was suggested that for future regattas, the event should be celebrated by the wearing of a sprig of silver wattle blossom (Acacia dealbata) tied with British Navy blue ribbon. The proposal attracted some ridicule as the silver wattle blooms in August and September and would be unobtainable in November . As a result, the November-flowering black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) was substituted for the regatta. The custom of wearing a sprig of wattle at the regatta persisted until at least 1883. The theme of wattle in literature, poetry and song took off from the 1860s to the early 1900s. When Adam Lindsay Gordon died in 1870 he was buried 'here the wattle blossoms wave' - a quotation from his poem 'The sick Stockrider'. There were wattle waltzes and you could drink Foster's Wattle beer. A \\"Wattle Blossom League\\" was inaugurated by W. J. Sowden and the South Australian chapter of the Australian Natives' Association in 1890 as a women's branch of the Association. The aim of the 'Wattle Blossom League' was to 'encourage Australian literature and music'. Members should 'at all suitable public assemblies wear a spray of wattle blossom either real or artificial, as a distinctive badge'. Another aim of the league was 'to promote a national patriotic sentiment among the women of Australia'. The last monthly meeting of the Wattle Blossom League was held at Beach's Rooms on 1 June 1893.  The Wattle Club, 1899  The push for the recognition of the nation-wide use of wattle as a symbol of the first day of spring was given momentum by the formation in 1899 of the \\"Wattle Club\\" in Victoria. It was initiated by Archibald James Campbell, a leading ornithologist and field naturalist with a particular passion for Australian wattles, of which there are more than 1,000 species. For several years the club organised bush outings on the first day in September specifically for the appreciation of wattles in their natural setting. Campbell was an active member of the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria. Their 1904 outing went to the You Yangs and in 1906 they went to the Werribee Gorge. Wattle Day League, 1909 Golden wattle Acacia pycnantha The first suggestion of a dedicated Wattle Day was made by Campbell during a speech in September 1908. The Wattle Day League was formed on 13 September 1909 at the Elizabeth Street, Sydney headquarters of the Royal Society, with J. H. Maiden, director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens as president. Its purpose was to present to the various State governments a unified proposal for a national day on which to celebrate the wattle blossom. In 1910 the League settled on \\"Wattle Day\\" as 1 September, and approached Sowden to form a branch of the League in South Australia. Campbell and A. K. Warner founded a branch in Melbourne. It was taken up, and there were celebrations in 1910 in three state capital cities: Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, although the Melbourne event was a muted affair due to heavy rain. The day was significant in being the first organised demonstration on a definite day across a number of States ever witnessed in Australia. On 1 September 1911 Adelaide was described as a city 'decked with gold'. In 1913, the national Wattle Day League (or Federation) was established to formalise the organisation of events for the celebration of Wattle Day Queensland followed in 1913. Sydney celebrated that year by planting 200 wattle trees in centennial Park. Australian Coat of Arms with the Golden Wattle design, 1921 The Golden Wattle was incorporated as an accessory in the design of the Coat of Arms of Australia in 1912. Following the outbreak of World War 1 all attempts to gazette the emblem or Wattle Day were put aside. There was some confusion in NSW over the date. In 1916, New South Wales changed its date for Wattle Day to 1 August, so that the indigenous, early-flowering Cootamundra wattle (Acacia baileyana) could be used. The Cootamundra Wattle was planted all over Sydney and when the Red Cross called for sprigs of wattle to sell in Martin Place for the war effort, this species had mostly finished flowering. The League was granted a temporary change. Schools in NSW continued to use 1 August as the date for Wattle Day and there was some resistance to 1 September despite the association with Spring. That resistance now appears to have almost disappeared. Among other poetry, Scottish-Australian poet and bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963) wrote 'Sunny country' which was often recited on past Wattle Days: :I dreamed of a sunny country last night, a golden dream :Of wattles down, the gully, and of gum, trees by the stream; :Of dancing haze and sides of blue, no other land can show :Save this, our sunny country, where the golden wattles grow.  Australian Bicentennial Celebration, 1988  On 19 August 1988, as part of the extended celebrations marking the (not uncontroversial) 200th anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet of British convict ships at Sydney in 1788, the golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) was officially proclaimed as Australia's national floral emblem by the Governor-General of Australia, the Rt Hon Sir Ninian Stephen AK GCMG GCVO KBE. A formal ceremony was held in the National Botanic Gardens on 1 September at which Ms Hitchcock was a guest of the government. Specimens of Acacia pycnantha were planted near the entry.  National Wattle Day, 1992  In 1986 Maria Hitchcock of Armidale NSW began a campaign to have both gazetted. With the aid of ABC's Ian McNamara (\\"Macca\\"), whose Sunday morning national program Australia All Over focuses on all things Australian, the message went out resulting in hundreds of letters of support being sent to the Prime Minister. The campaign was not progressing until Maria Hitchcock met with Senator Graham Richardson at a Labor Party event in Armidale. Soon after the decision was made to gazette the Emblem at a special ceremony in Canberra at the ANBG on 1 September. At that ceremony Ms Hitchcock was told by Senator Ray that she would have to personally gain letters of approval for the gazettal of National Wattle Day from each Premier and Chief Minister. Once again enlisting the aid of Ian McNamara and his loyal listeners, a new campaign of letter writing began. It took three years but the goal was finally achieved. Ms Hitchcock bundled all the letters together and sent them to Canberra requesting gazettal of National Wattle Day for 1 September each year. On 23 June 1992, Bill Hayden, the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, declared that \\"1 September in each year shall be observed as 'National Wattle Day' throughout Australia and in the external Territories of Australia\\". 2010 marked the centenary of the celebration of Wattle Day on 1 September 1910 in NSW, Victoria and South Australia, and Australian Geographic magazine was amongst those who urged the public not to miss the chance to celebrate it again. Current celebrations The grass roots celebration of National Wattle Day has taken some time to evolve. With Indigenous controversy over 26 January as Australia Day appearing to grow stronger, Australians are looking for an alternative date and National Wattle Day has been proposed.

The game is also popular in Egypt, Lebanon, and other Middle Eastern countries. The name is a Greek borrowing from the Arabic word basra. In Turkey, the game is known as pi≈üti or pi≈üpirik.David Parlett, The Oxford guide to card games pg. 138 Oxford University Press (1990)  History  The game originated in Greece and is known in different variations such as diloti and kseri. The game has been exported by both the Cypriot and Turkish diasporas, and it is played in Cypriot communities in Australia, Canada, England, and the United States, usually passed on by the first generation of immigrants to their children and grandchildren. Despite this, the game is virtually unknown in these countries outside of the Cypriot and Greek communities. In Turkey, the game is still very popular.  The game  The game is played with a 52 card deck and can involve two, three, or four players, although the game is most interesting in the two or four player versions. In the four player version, the players can play for themselves or in two player teams. The first team or player to score 100 points is the winner.  The play  The dealer starts by dealing 1 card to each player, starting with the player on the dealer's left, until each player has 4 cards. The dealer then places 4 cards in the middle of the table, called the board. If 1 or more of the 4 cards is a jack, the dealer returns the jack(s) to the bottom of the deck and replaces it or them with the next card(s) from the top of the deck. The play begins with the player to the dealer's left, until all cards are played out. The players either collect (fish) cards from the board or add a card to the board, if they cannot fish any cards. After the cards are exhausted, the dealer then deals each player 4 more cards from the remaining deck. The dealer, however, does not deal 4 cards onto the board as done for the opening hand. The hands are played out until there are no remaining cards to be dealt. In the two player version, each round has six hands. In the three player version, each round has four hands. In the four player version, each round consists of three hands.  Scoring  The scoring is as follows: * The aces, which have a numeral value of 1, are worth 1 point each. * The jacks are worth 1 point each. * The two of clubs is worth 2 points. * The ten of diamonds is worth 3 points. * The player or team that collects the most cards in a given hand receives 3 points. In the event of a tie, each player or team receives 3 points. * The player or team that collects all the cards in play without benefit of a jack receives 10 points, or a bastra.  Collecting cards  The object of the game is to collect total cards and cards that are worth various points. Cards are collected as follows: *Pairing: Any card may be used to take another card or cards of the same denomination, i.e. a 7 takes a 7, a king takes a king, a 6 takes two 6s, etc. *Combining: Multiple cards may be collected through adding the numeral value of the cards together. For example, the board shows 2, an ace, 5 and 4. A player with a 3 could take 2 and the ace (2+1=3), or a player holding a 9 could take 5 and 4 (5+4=9), or a player holding a 7 could take 2, the ace and 4 (2+1+4=7). **A player may also collect combinations of the same sum. For example, if the board shows 5, 4, 2 and 7, a 9 would take all 4 cards, i.e. 5+4 and 2+7=9 (this would also be a Bastra). *Pairing and combining: Taking cards through pairing and combining can occur on the same play. For example, if the board showed 3 6 5 4 and 9, a 9 would take all the cards, i.e. 3+6 and 5+4=9, plus the 9 would be paired with the 9 (this would also be a Bastra). On the last hand, there are often uncollected cards left on the board. These cards are awarded to the last player or team to collect a card.  Jack  The jack is the most powerful card because it can collect all the cards on the board. However, if a jack is played onto an empty board, it is lost and remains in play until one of the players can collect it, usually with another jack.  Basra  The basra is the most important scoring play of the game since it is worth 10 points. A basra occurs when a player succeeds in clearing the board without benefit of a jack. For example, if the board shows just a 7 and a player collects it with another 7, that player or team receives 10 points. In another scenario, if the board shows 3 and 2 and a player collects them with a 5, that player or team also receives 10 points. In the rare event that a jack takes a solitary jack, no basra is awarded  Placement of collected cards  The players place the collected cards close to their position at the table. To record bastras, the player places the bastra card face up, sticking out of the player's pile of collected cards. The dealer should be careful to place his or her collected cards away from the deck, so as to avoid confusion. Players are not allowed to look at their collected cards until the end of the hand. At the end of the hand, the players count their total cards and points.  End of game  The game ends when one player or team reaches 100 points. In the rare event of a tie (2 players or teams finish even beyond the 100 point mark) there are various tie- breaking options, determined by the players by mutual consent. The game can be declared a draw, or an extra hand or hands can be played until the tie is broken. Or the players can extend the game to a fixed number of points (20, 30 or 50).  Strategy  Although the rules and play of the game are relatively simple, the strategy is much more complex. The bastra is the most crucial element of the game, as a 20 or 30 point lead or deficit can be quickly frittered away or overturned by conceding or taking bastras.  Remembering which cards have been played  The most important element of the game is remembering which cards have been played. This way, if you are forced to play into an open board, you have an idea of the probability of which cards remain. For example, if you know that two 6s have been played and you hold a 6 in your hand, there is a good chance your opponent may not hold a 6 (as there is only one 6 remaining). It is also important to remember which point cards have been played. For example, if you are holding two 10s (one of which happens to be the 10 of diamonds, worth 3 points) and you know that the other 10s have been played, you could throw down the other 10 and have a good chance of collecting it with the 10 of diamonds later in the hand.  When to play point cards  The rule of thumb is to hold the point cards to the end, especially if you are in position to play the last card, since your opponents will in all likelihood hold on to their point cards as well. An ace played early in the hand will almost always be lost, usually through combining. The same applies to the 2 of clubs.  Use of the jacks  The jacks are very powerful cards. Although they are worth only 1 point each, they can lead to more points elsewhere. It is generally considered good strategy to hold the jacks to the end of the hand. This serves 2 purposes. On the one hand, if your opponents are holding point cards, you will collect them. On the other hand, you clear the board and increase your chances of getting a bastra by forcing your opponent to play into an open board at the start of the next hand, when you will have 4 fresh cards in your hands. You may, however, play the jack earlier in the hand, especially if there are points sitting on the board. You may also play the jack if there are a lot of cards on the board (even if there are no point cards), in order to enhance your chances of winning the 3 bonus points for most cards (if you feel you have enough cards to do so). If you have 2 jacks in your hand, you should play one at the beginning of the hand. There is no point playing them back-to-back at the end. For the last hand, you have to be careful to play your jack early enough so as not to lose it. If you play the jack onto an open board at the end, your opponent will get it if he or she was the last player to collect cards.  Use of the face cards  The face cards appear to have little value, since they do not bring points. But they can be used as a tactic to prevent bastras. For example, if you are faced with a board that has just a 3, and your numeral cards risk giving a bastra (you have 4,6 and a king for example), it would be a safe play to drop the king, thus preventing your opponent from having a bastra opportunity (playing one of the numeral cards would set up a bastra if your opponent has 9 or 7). It is also wise to drop the face cards in order to conserve numeral cards for later in the hand, in the event that your opponent plays a point card.  Using low cards to set up bastras  Sometimes it is good strategy to play a low card when facing an empty board if you are not sure of which cards have been played. For example, if you are holding 2, 6 and 8, you may want to drop the 2, forcing your opponent to set you up for a bastra himself if he does not have a 9, jack or a face card.  Order of playing cards  It is generally wise to build the hand by playing lower numeral cards ahead of the higher ones since combining is used to collect cards. For example, if you have 3, 4, 7 and 9, it would be wiser to start with the 3 and 4 and work your way up. Otherwise, it will be harder to collect cards if you start with the 9 and 7. As well, the higher cards can be used to collect aces in combination with other cards. In any scenario where you have the 2 of clubs and another 2, or the 10 of diamonds and another ten, never play the card with the point value first ‚Äì if you lose the other 10, at least you are not losing any points!  Defensive strategies  As a general rule, a board with high cards and face cards will yield fewer opportunities for bastras. A very conservative tactic to prevent bastras is to play a jack into an open board (since a jack that takes a jack does not get the 10 points). Although this is considered an unusual tactic, it can be justified near the end of a close game, where a bastra could change the balance of the scores. It is usually unwise to play point cards into an open board because the bastra conceded will be doubly painful (10 points plus the point value of the card). Winning the race to collect the most cards (worth 3 points) is not that crucial, since the game is almost always decided by the number of bastras taken and conceded. It is more important to collect point cards and bastras than total cards. Be alert if your opponent drops a 2 or a 10, or tries to build combinations adding to 10 ‚Äì your opponent may be trying to fish them out with the 2 of clubs or the 10 of diamonds. If you cannot fish these cards out yourself, you may want to collect other cards that will force your opponent to leave you with a bastra opportunity if your opponent decides to go ahead and collect the point card. For example, let's say your opponent plays the 10 of hearts and the board now shows 3, 8 and 10. If you had an 8, it would be wise to fish out the 8, that way, if your opponent did indeed have the 10 of diamonds, this would leave you a potential bastra with the 3 should your opponent decide to go ahead and fish out the 10. You could also solve this problem by clearing the board with a jack. In the same vein, try to avoid playing combinations that add up to 10, if the 10 of diamonds remains to be played.  Related games   Egyptian basra  The Egyptian fishing game, basra, has the same rules of bastra with the following differences: * Scoring :The player or team that collects the most cards in a given hand receives 30 points. In the event of a tie, each having 26 cards, bonus points are cancelled and the initial 30 points are held in abeyance and added to the 30 points of the next round, this is repeated for each tie until the tie is broken. * Powerful card :The 7 of diamonds is the second most powerful card because it can collect all the cards on the board. If the cards on the floor are all numerals, and their values add up to 10 or less, this counts as a basra, and scores the 10 point bonus. If the floor adds up to more than ten, or includes picture cards, the 7 of diamonds still takes all the cards but it does not count as a basra. However, if a 7 of diamonds is played onto an empty board, it is lost and remains in play until one of the players can collect it, usually with another 7. * Basra :A double basra is awarded (20 points) when a jack takes a solitary jack. In some variations, a double basra is awarded (30 points). * End of game :The game ends when one player or team reaches 101 or 121 points depending on agreement between players. If both players reach 101 or 121 in the same round, the player with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, additional rounds are played until the tie is broken.  Yemeni basra  Yemeni basra has the same rules of the Egyptian basra with the following differences: * Powerful card :The 7 of diamonds is the second most powerful card because it can collect all the cards on the board. :When the seven of diamonds is played, it counts as a basra in the following cases: :: The total value of the cards on the floor is less than 10 (not if it is equal to 10). :: The only card(s) on the floor are tens, queens and kings. :: The cards on the floor can be divided into two or more groups which score an equal number of points, less than 10. For example, capturing A-2-7-8 with the diamond 7 would be a basra, because (1+8)=(2+7)=9. However, if a 7 of diamonds is played onto an empty board, it is lost and remains in play until one of the players can collect it, usually with another 7. * Basra :A double basra is awarded (20 points) when a jack takes a solitary jack. * End of game :The game ends when one player or team reaches 101 points or 121 depending on the agreement between players. If both players reach 101 or 121 in the same round, the player with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, additional rounds are played until the tie is broken.  Ethiopian basra Ethiopian basra has the same rules as Egyptian basra with the following differences: * Scoring :The player or team that collects the most cards in a given hand receives 3 points. In the event of a tie where each team has 26 cards, no one gets 3 points. The game continues until the tie is broken. * Basra :In the case of numerals equal to or below 10, numeral combining (grouping) is allowed as long as picture cards are not in the floor. For example capturing 10-4-6 OR A-2-7-8 with the 7 diamonds would be a basra since (10)=(4+6)=10 or (1+8)=(2+7)=9. :The prince/jack card is impossible to basra (and also a jack can not do a basra on another jack). :If the komai (seven of diamonds) is left alone on the table, then any card except the jack can do on it Basra. * End of game :The game ends when one player or team reaches 52. If both players reach 52 in the same round, the player with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, additional rounds are played until the tie is broken.  Lebanese basra  Lebanese basra has two variants. It has the same rules of bastra with the following differences: Lebanese basra variant A * Play :Six cards are usually dealt to each player. * Scoring :If there is a tie, each team having 26 cards, no one gets 3 points. * Basra :In this variant, a basra occurs only when: ::* a single card is left alone on the table ‚Äì either because all the other cards were captured, or because the table was cleared (perhaps with a jack), forcing the next player to play a single card. If the following player can match this single card (thereby capturing it), this counts as a basra and scores 10 points. Capturing a lone card other than a jack by playing a jack does not count as a basra; capturing a lone jack with another jack counts as an ordinary single basra, not a double one. ::* There is a single card alone on the table, the next player plays a card that does not capture it, and the following player is able to clear the table by playing a card equal to the sum of these two cards. For example, the table contains a lone 3. The next player plays a 4 (perhaps having no other card). If the following player can play a 7, capturing the 3 + 4, this is a basra, worth 10 points. * End of game :Whichever team reaches a score of 101 points first wins the game. If both players reach 101 in the same round, the player with the higher score wins. In the case of a tie, additional rounds are played until the tie is broken. Lebanese Basra variant B This variant is called \\"ashush\\". * Play :Six or four cards are usually dealt to each player, depending on agreement between players. * Scoring :If there is a tie, each team having 26 cards, no one gets 3 points. * Basra :In this variation, a basra occurs only when a single card is left alone on the table ‚Äì either because all the other cards were captured, or because the table was cleared (perhaps with a jack), forcing the next player to play a single card. If the following player can match this single card (thereby capturing it), this counts as a basra and scores 10 points. Capturing a lone card other than a jack by playing a jack does not count as a basra; capturing a lone jack with another jack counts as an ordinary single basra, not a double one. * End of game :Whichever team reaches a score of 101 points first wins the game. If both players reach 101 in the same round, the player with the higher score wins. In case of a tie, additional rounds are played until the tie is broken.  Palestinian basra  A version of basra is played in Palestine and Jordan. It has the same rules of bastra with these differences: (1)The Play There are only 44 cards in the card deck. Kings and Queens cards are usually thrown out. 4 cards are usually dealt to each player although there is a variation where 5 cards are dealt (2) Scoring If there is a tie, each team having 26 cards, no one gets 3 points. (3) Basra In this version of Basra, the score for a Basra is twice the face value of the card used to make the capture. For example, a Basra with a 7 scores 14 points in the case of capturing a 7 Spades with a 7 Diamonds. If you capture a Jack with a lone Jack, there is no Basra. (4) End of game The game ends when one player or team reaches 101 or 151 depending on agreement between players.  Jordanian Basra  In Jordan, there are two variants of Basra. Jordanian Basra variant (A) This Basra variant is the same as Palestinian Basra. It should be born in mind that the Palestinian Basra is the most dominant Basra variant in Jordan. Jordanian Basra variant (B) This version of Basra card game is reported by Muthana Haddad. This variant of Jordanian Basra is the same as Palestinian Basra except that the picture cards, Queens and Kings, are used and the value of these cards differs as well. If the picture cards, Queens and Kings are used, they count as 10 for this purpose, so if a Queen captures a lone Queen from the table the score will be 20 points.  Syrian Basra  In Syria, there is more than one variant of Basra. Syrian Basra variant (A) This Basra variant is similar to the Palestinian Basra with the following differences: (1)The Play There are only 52 cards in the card deck. Kings and Queens cards are not thrown out. 4 or 6 cards are usually dealt to each player. (2) Basra The value of a Queen is 3 points, so if you capture a queen with another queen, you acquire the double point, that is 6 points. The value of a King is 4 points, so if you capture a king with another king, you acquire the double point, that is 8 points. Capturing a Jack with a Jack is as scored follows:- The value of a Jack is 12.5, so if you capture a Jack with another Jack, you acquire 25 points. Syrian Basra variant (B) This Basra variant is called Homsi Basra. It is similar to the Palestinian Basra with the following difference:- Basra The value of a Jack is 12.5, so if you capture a Jack with another Jack, you acquire 25 points.

It's not listed for use in AOC wine, but is a minor component of blends for local drinking, in some ways an Alsatian equivalent of its sibling Aligot√© in Burgundy. History Nurseryman Johann Michael Ortlieb brought the grape to Riquewihr in 1756. It is probably closely related to R√§uschling. DNA fingerprinting has shown that it is one of many grapes to be the result of a cross between Gouais blanc (Heunisch) and Pinot, making it a full sibling of famous varieties such as Chardonnay. Gouais blanc was widely grown by the peasantry in the Medieval ages. This offered many opportunities for hybridization, and the offspring benefited from hybrid vigor as the parents were genetically quite different. Other Gouais blanc/Pinot crosses include Aubin vert, Auxerrois, Bachet noir, Beaunoir, Franc Noir de la Haute-Sa√¥ne, Gamay Blanc Gloriod, Gamay, Melon, Peurion, Romorantin, Roublot, and Sacy. Knipperl√© is a parent of the following grapes, mostly riparia hybrids with Millardet et Grasset 101-14 : Bon noir, Colmar Precoce noir, Fin noir, Gutkniperle, Kuhlmann 252-3, Kuhlmann 274-1, Millardet Et Grasset 101-14 X Ortlieber, Neron, Triomphe D'Alsace, Victoire Viticulture The vine is vigorous but yields are variable, and it is particularly susceptible to grey rot.

Early life and career He was born in Budapest and began his violin studies with his father, Lajos Vecsey. At the age of 8 he entered the studio of Jen≈ë Hubay. Two years later, aged 10, he played for Joseph Joachim in Berlin (making his d√©but at \\"Beethoven Halle\\" on 17 May 1903) and subsequently became known as a stellar child prodigy virtuoso. Joseph Joachim and the young Franz von Vecsey (c.1905) He became one of the pre-eminent violinists in Europe in the 1910s and 1920s, at one point touring with B√©la Bart√≥k as his piano accompanist. Aged only 12, he became the re-dedicatee of Jean Sibelius' Violin Concerto in D minor in 1905, when the original dedicatee, Willy Burmester, refused to play the work after he was unable to appear at the premiere of the revised version, which was premiered by Karel Hal√≠≈ô instead. Vecsey championed the Sibelius concerto, first performing it when he was only 13. He was the dedicatee of Hubay's Violin Concerto No.3.IMSLP - Violin Concerto No.3, Op.99 (Hubay, Jen√∂) He also spent time composing, and wrote a number of virtuosic salon pieces for the violin. Later life and career From 1926 until his death, he lived with his wife in Venice, at the \\"Palazzo Giustinian de'Vescovi\\" on Canal Grande. His career steadily faltered after the First World War, as he grew tired of constant touring and wanted to concentrate more on conducting. Illness and death By the 1930s, he was about to embark on that dream, but it suddenly curtailed in 1935, when he became seriously ill with a pulmonary embolism that grew through much of his life. He sought medical care in Rome, where he received surgery. The operation was unsuccessful, and Vecsey succumbed to the disease at the age of 42.

His entire life was occupied by efforts to reverse the downfall the Trencavel had experienced during the Albigensian Crusade, but he ultimately failed. Raymond was only two years old when his father, Raymond Roger, died in prison on 10 November 1209. He would have automatically inherited the viscounties of B√©ziers, Carcassonne, Albi, and Raz√®s, but Carcassone was granted to Simon de Montfort immediately after Raymond Roger's death and Albi was granted to him in June 1210.Graham-Leigh, 44. On 25 November 1209, Agnes, Raymond's mother and guardian, relinquished her dowry in the P√©zenas and Tourbes, which would have gone to Raymond, to Simon in exchange for a pension of 3,000 solidi annually and compensation of 25,000 solidi for her dowry, to be made in four annual payments. When Raymond was only three, his mother negotiated the surrender of all his remaining lands and titles at the siege of Minerve on 11 June 1210. The surrender was made in the presence of Arnaud Amalric, Fulk of Toulouse, and Berengar of Barcelona and confirmed by the Council of Narbonne in January 1211. Until the formal act of the council, the overlord of the Trencavel viscounties, Peter II of Aragon, had refused to recognise Simon's takeover. Raymond's youth after his surrender of his hereditary offices and lands was spent in the care of Raymond Roger of Foix and his successor, Roger Bernard II of Foix.Graham-Leigh, 124. In October 1224 Roger Bernard was described as custos Trencavelli vicecomitis et terre sue: \\"custodian of the viscount Trencavel and his lands.\\" His lands are specified in a slightly later charter as vicecomitatus Biterrensis, Carcasson√¶ et Redensis et Albiensis pro D. vicecomite Trencavello, consobrino meo: \\"viscounty of B√©ziers, Carcassonne and Raz√®s and Albi by God's viscount Trencavel, my cousin\\". William of Puylaurens records that the viscount was sixteen years old in 1223 or 1224. In 1224, when after a general rebellion Amaury VI of Montfort ceded his rights over Raymond's former lands to the Crown, Carcassonne was reconquered by Roger Bernard and Raymond VII of Toulouse, who bestowed it (and B√©ziers according to one charter) on Raymond Trencavel, now of age.Graham-Leigh, 45. During the next two years as viscount, Raymond removed Guy des Vaux-de-Cernay from the diocese of Carcassonne and replaced him with Berengar Raymond, and he restored the abbot Alet, Boso, who had been deposed by a papal legation in 1222. Raymond's attitude towards the Church in the Carcass√®s is indicative of the Crusaders' disdain for the local clergy and the way in which the local nobility persecuted by the Crusade came to the support of the persecuted clergy.Graham-Leigh, 82-83. Raymond could not hold the town against King Louis VIII in 1226, however, and he was again dispossessed. His loss was less formal the second time and he continued to employ his title and act in his capacity as viscount into 1227.He appears in a charter of 17 June 1227 as Trencavellus ... Biterrensis vicecomes, dominus Albiensis, Carcasson√¶ et Redensis: \\"Trencavel ... of B√©ziers viscount, lord of Albi, Carcassonne, and Raz√®s\\". At that time he had achieved his majority and was even granting property to his former guardian, the count of Foix. Raymond continued to rule Limoux as a vassal of the count of Foix until the Treaty of Paris of 12 April 1229, when all formerly Trencavel lands were surrendered to the French crown. After that he went into exile, probably to either the court of Foix, Aragon, or Catalonia.Graham-Leigh, 167. In 1240 he made an attack on Carcassonne in an attempt to retake it. But though he had the help of Olivier de Termes and besieged the city from 17 September until 11 October, a royal army forced him to relent and flee to Montr√©al, where he was himself besieged. He escaped and went into exile again until 1247, when he finally surrendered to Louis IX and symbolically broke his vicecomital seals. Raymond was allowed to continue to rule Limoux, where he was in power as late as 1263. He took part in the Seventh Crusade in 1248. He left a wife and two sons, Roger and Raymond Roger, who succeeded him, but their history and that of all subsequent Trencavels is obscure in the extreme. Raymond was dead by 1267, when his son is first recorded as \\"of B√©ziers\\", the family name. Throughout his life and career after his surrender in 1210, Raymond always called himself simply \\"Trencavel\\" in his own charters, a practice not thitherto common in his family. The name Trencavel had been reserved for members named Raymond and it appears that Raymond II preferred it to his given name, or desired to assert his familial connexions through its preeminence.Graham-Leigh, 147.

History thumb The name of the building is somewhat of a misnomer as the building never actually functioned as a hotel. If the hotel had opened it would have been part of the Pick-Wenzel chain. The hotel was to feature a complete bakery, a barber shop, a banquet hall, a business center, a large lobby and dining room. The depression struck, the building was up, but the interiors were not completed. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The building stood empty for many years, until the Gospel Trumpet bought the building and converted it into apartments. A three-story auto hotel was built adjacent to the Tower Hotel. The auto hotel was a business concept that really never became popular, but in addition to offering parking, full maintenance service was offered for the automobile. The auto hotel was torn down in the 1990s. In 1997, the Tower Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is also a part of the Anderson Downtown Historic District, Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. which was listed on the National Register in 2006. In late 2011, the owners of the Tower Hotel (then known as Tower Place) were forced to close when maintenance and operation costs became too much to bear. The building sat with its first two levels covered in plywood until February 2013, when it was announced the building would be sold via auction. Initial estimates had the building going for between $200,000 and $250,000. An open house was held the week before the auction to proved potential buyers with a chance to tour the building before bidding. On February 20, 2013, The Tower Hotel was purchased by Russian-born business owner, Youri Frankine for $100,000. In his own words, \\"I like the property. I want to make it just like it was,‚Äù. As for the Tower's interior, Mr Frankine said, ‚ÄúI want the apartments to be nice, something to reflect the historic outside look of the building.\\" He hopes the project will revitalize Anderson's downtown.

Some of her most renowned work was on the Precambrian Ediacaran Biota in South Australia. Wade was born in Adelaide, South Australia and spent her early life on a property in the northeast of the state. She lived the typical country girl's life, it is said. Her family moved when she was seven to Thistle Island in Spencer Gulf where she first became interested in geology. She studied geology and biology at the University of Adelaide, and in 1954 completed a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Micropalaeontology. Wade worked as a Senior Demonstrator at the University, while completing her Doctorate of Philosophy in 1959. Studying remotely via correspondence, Wade was sent on scholarship to the Wilderness School in Adelaide as a boarder from the age of 13. After she finished school, she undertook a Bachelor of Science in Geology at the University of Adelaide before graduating in 1954. Wade worked as a demonstrator while she undertook her PhD on tertiary aged microfossils, under the supervision of Professor Martin Glaessner.  Career  In 1959, after Wade received her Doctorate of Philosophy she took up research at the University of Adelaide looking into the earliest forms of animal life. In 1968, while at the University of Adelaide she worked with Martin Glaessner on the precambrian jellyfish fossils found in the Ediacara Hills of the Flinders Ranges. In 1971, Wade moved to the Queensland Museum as curator of geology, and worked her way up to becoming Deputy Director in 1980. She studied the Cambrian and Ordovician nautiloids from north Western Queensland. She also studied vertebrate fossils arranging for the preparation for display of a Cretaceous ichthyosaur, which had first come to the museum in 1935. She developed a network of contacts around Winton, and with Dr Tony Thulborn, they organized and supervised the excavation of 3000 dinosaur footprints in the Tully Ranges from 1976-1977. This site, known as Lark Quarry, is now a major tourist destination, and is on the National Heritage list for the quality of the dinosaur footprints, evidence of a dinosaur stampede. Wade, Thulborn and Alan Bartholomai joined an expedition from the Natural History Museum in 1978 to collect Mesozoic reptiles from around Winton. In 1987, with the assistance of contacts in the Hughenden area, Wade recovered a second skull of the Queensland dinosaur, Muttaburrasaurus. She was able to excavate specimens of Kronoaurus, and secure the site and remains of Jurassic sauropod, Rhoetosaurus, which had been lost since the 1920s. In 1990, Wade excavated the most complete Pliosaurus fossil at Hughenden, presently known. She continued research into mollusc fossils of the Great Artesian Basin. Wade became an Honorary Research Associate of the Queensland Museum after retiring in 1993. She moved to western Queensland, helping to develop the Fossil Centers at Richmond and Hughenden. Wade received the Queensland Museum Medal in 1994. Her research led to the development of Kronosaurus Korner in Richmond, the Flinders Discovery Centre in Hughenden, and Lark Quarry near Winton. The Dinosaur Trail tourist program is based on the work she and her contacts began. In 1998, the Geological Society of Australia dedicated a special symposium in her honor. A prize is now given in her honor at the biennial Palaeo Down Under conference. Wade died in Charters Towers, Queensland, in 2005. She did not marry, and was survived by her brother.

It was designed by Allied Works Council and built from 1943 to 1944 by Stuart Bros Pty Ltd of Sydney. It is also known as Air Defence Headquarters Ruin Sydney (former), No. 1 Fighter Section Headquarters, 1FSHQ, Bankstown Bunker and RAAF No. 1 Installation Bankstown; No. 101 Fighter Sector. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011. After the arrival of General Douglas MacArthur in Australia during the Second World War, Bankstown Airport was established as a key strategic air force base to support the war effort. During this period the specially constructed bunker became an important RAAF headquarters from 1945 until its closure in 1947. The Bankstown bunker is currently buried under a public park which lies at the end of Taylor Street.Images of the Bankstown Bunker located in Condell Park. History From 1945 to 1947 the Bankstown bunker was used as a covert Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base. Construction of the facility commenced in late 1942 at a cost of A¬£30,579 with its official commissioning in January 1945 as the headquarters for No. 1 Fighter Sector RAAF. This unit had previously operated from the Capital Hall picture theatre in Bankstown and a tunnel under the St. James Railway station. The bunker was manned at all times in shifts that the Air Force called \\"Flights\\". Most of the personnel that worked in the bunker were local. Even so, the Air Force provided accommodation for them in Chapel Road, Bankstown whilst buses with blacked out windows transported military personnel to the bunker. All staff for the bunker had to undergo special training, including 'plane identification' training that also took place at Chapel Road. The bunker was manned by members of the No.2 Volunteer Air Observer Corps, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. A transmitting station for the bunker was located in Johnston Road, Bass Hill and was a building of above ground construction. The bunker appears to have been decommissioned when the ADHQ was disbanded in 1947.(National Archives of Australia document 151/2/1098) A caretaker was then assigned to the take care of the bunker. It wasn't until 1971 that members of No. 2 Stores Depot RAAF in Regents Park invited the then editor of the Bankstown Torch, Phil Engisch into the bunker. Many photos were taken and an article was placed in local newspapers detailing the find. In 1972, arsonists set the bunker on fire. In 1976 the NSW Department of Housing acquired the land the bunker is built under and redeveloped the area into the townhouses that now cover most of the site. The area now comprises a number of separate complexes or \\"Closes\\" containing eight to eleven villas. Each Close is named appropriately after a type of aeroplane that flew from Bankstown during the Second World War. No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters Unit With the fall of Rabaul and Singapore to the Japanese Army in January and February 1942 and the bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942, the Australian government and many Australians became fearful that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. As part of the Australian Government's response to this threat, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was greatly expanded and the RAAF for the first time was given the role of air defence of Australia's strategic areas. Fighter Sector Headquarters were established in Sydney, New Lambton (NSW), Melbourne, Brisbane, Townsville, Darwin, Perth and in Port Moresby. In addition Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters were formed at Darwin, Perth, Townsville and Camden (NSW). The main responsibilities of the Fighter Sector Headquarters were to: * receive aircraft sightings from radar posts (known as Radio Direction Finding Posts), Navy ships, Volunteer Air Observer Corps lookout posts and other sources; * Determine whether aircraft were friendly or hostile and if hostile direct fighter squadrons and/or Navy ships and Army anti-aircraft artillery units to shoot down the aircraft; * issue air raid warnings to RAAF, Army and Navy headquarters and civil authorities such as the police and fire brigades; * operate search-light batteries. Sydney Fighter Sector Headquarters, known as No. 1 Fighter Sector Headquarters (1FSHQ), was established on 25 February 1942 and was responsible for the aerial defence of New South Wales. A temporary operations and plotting room were set up at the Capitol Picture Theatre in Bankstown (now the site of Bankstown Town Hall). Less than two months later, on 16 April, 1FSHQ handed over its responsibilities to the US Army Air Corps and the unit was disbanded. In the next few months the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) relocated air defence operations to a disused railway tunnel near St. James Railway Station in the city. On 3 August 1942 1FSHQ was reformed under the command of the RAAF Headquarters Eastern Area and the 1FSHQ once again took over responsibility for the air defence of New South Wales. The operations room was moved back to the Capitol Theatre in Bankstown on 7 September 1942. At this time the 1FSHQ comprised 19 officers and 164 other ranks, including 119 members of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). The senior RAAF officers were largely drawn from aircrew, with junior RAAF officers being intelligence or administrative officers. Two of the unit officers were WAAAF officers and there were also Army and Navy officers in the unit for liaison duties. The enlisted personnel included: Operators of telephones, teleprinters, radio telegraphy and telephony equipment who received the reports on aircraft movements from: radar stations, members of the Volunteer Air Observers Corps (Australia), ships, No. 2 and No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters, and by other means; * Clerks who plotted the location of aircraft and shipping on large maps; * Technicians who maintained the communications equipment; and * Support staff such as administrative clerks, cooks and drivers. Between October 1943 and January 1945 the 1FSHQ underwent several name changes. On 18 October 1943 it was renamed the No. 101 Fighter Sector and then on 7 March 1944 the name was changed to No. 101 Fighter Control Unit. On 21 January 1945 the unit was renamed Air Defence Headquarters Sydney (ADHQ Sydney) and air defence operations were moved into a purpose built operations room located at Condell Park. By this time many of the RAAF members of the unit had been posted to northern Australia or New Guinea and members of the No. 2 Volunteer Air Observers Corps (VAOC) had taken their places. Air Defence Headquarters Sydney Documentary evidence indicates that the search for a permanent site to construct a purpose built combined Fighter Sector Headquarters and Gun Operation Room was underway by August 1942. Eventually the site of a shallow quarry on Black Charlie's Hill was selected. The site had extensive views to the east, west and to the south and on a clear day, reportedly the arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge could be seen. The land, which was owned by the Bankstown Hospital Trust, was resumed under National Security Regulations. The Commonwealth Government later acquired the site in circa August 1945. Approval for the construction of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was given by the Minister of Air, as an urgent war measure, on 7 November 1942. Work on the two-storey underground bunker was scheduled to begin in January 1943 and surviving documentation indicates that by April the foundations of the structure were well under way. Construction of the Fighter Sector Headquarters was completed by August 1944, with the exception of the installation of the telephone and signals cables, which were to be installed by the Post Master General's Office in November of that year. The main contractor of the project was Stuart Bros Pty Ltd of Sydney. Bankstown Municipal Council carried out the electrical reticulation of the building and the air conditioning equipment appears to have been supplied and installed by Carrier Air Conditioning Limited of Spring Street, Sydney. The estimated cost to construct the bunker and the above ground, support buildings which included: an Administration Building, Rest Rooms and Kitchen, Male and Female Latrines, and Garage, was A¬£20,400. The final cost of the project was A¬£36,255. When completed the building comprised a ground floor and basement, at the heart of which was a two-storey high Operations Room. The Operations Room was dominated by a large plotting table, on which the WAAAF personnel plotted aircraft movements. Other key operational areas of the bunker included: a Gun Operations Room (anti-aircraft guns), the Search-light Operations Room and the Naval Plotting Room. The new covert Air Defence Headquarters became operational in January 1945. The unit history report for this period indicates that 49 officers and 128 other ranks of the RAAF and WAAAF staffed the ADHQ along with personnel from the Army, Navy and Volunteer Air Corp. However, as the ADHQ operated 24 hours a day, 7 days a week not all of the assigned personnel were on duty at one time. For security reasons the personnel were transported to and from the ADHQ by bus. Accommodation for ADHQ personnel was located in the Bankstown Shopping area. With the end of WWII in the Pacific in September 1945, the VAOC ceased full-time operations and the RAAF and WAAAF staff were demobilised. In January 1947 the ADHQ unit was disbanded and the bunker closed. The building remained unoccupied until , when it was briefly reoccupied by the Navy for naval manoeuvres in the Pacific. Following the conclusion of those manoeuvres the building was once again closed up. The bunker lay largely undisturbed until April 1971 when Phil Engisch, editor of the Bankstown - Canterbury Torch newspaper, accompanied by Alderman Leslie Gillman and others, toured the facility. Following the tour, the location of the ADHQ was made public in an article published in the Torch newspaper. The article, entitled \\"The Torch uncovers secret RAAF war base\\" was also simultaneously published in The Daily Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald. In the article Engisch recorded how the tour party wandered through a maze of corridors and intact rooms, likening the experience to \\"...something one might expect to see in a Sean Connery 007 movie.\\" Unfortunately, approximately four months after the location of the bunker was made public, the interior of the building was destroyed by fire. The fire is thought to have been started by either homeless people taking shelter in the bunker, or vandals. The blaze began on the evening of 9 August and is said to have burned for more than a week. In the early 1970s the Department of Defence handed over the site to the Commonwealth Department of Housing. In 1976 a Defence Housing Authority medium density housing scheme, designed by architectural firm Robertson and Hindmarsh Pty Ltd, was constructed on the former ADHQ site. The housing estate was designed to ensure that the underground bunker was located in one of the open spaces of the estate. It was at this time that the above ground, support buildings for the bunker were demolished. The exact location of the main entry and exit passages into the bunker are not known, as the area over the top and sides of the building has been landscaped concealing the bunker's existence. However, in the 1980s and 1990s the bunker was entered at least three occasions. On one such occasion, a film crew from the popular television show Burke's Backyard, crawled through an air vent into the facility and the television show's host, Don Burke, hosted an episode of the show from the bunker. Footage from the television show and photographs taken by other individuals who have gained entry to the building indicate that the facility is structurally intact. Associated buildings Air Board documentation indicates that the Fighter Sector VHF/RT system (Very High Frequency Radio Transmission System) was to comprise: 3 VHF/DF (Direction Finder) fixer stations, 1 VHF/DF homing station, 1 remote (local) transmitting station, 1 remote (local) receiving station and 2 relay stations (each consisting of a receiver and transmitter). In the case of the Sydney ADHQ relay stations were considered unnecessary by Defence authorities as it was anticipated that the height of the sites selected for the new VHF transmitter and receiver stations would ensure satisfactory communications. As it turned out, the new transmitting and receiver stations were never built and the Sydney ADHQ relied on the existing receiving station at Picnic Point, Revesby and the existing transmitting station at Johnston Street, Bass Hill. According to surviving documents radar stations at Robertson, Wentworth and Somersby were to acted as VHF/DF Fixer stations for the ADHQ. Other radar stations known to have passed on information (usually by telephone) to 1FSHQ and therefore probably to the ADHQ, were No. 17 Radar Station located at Moruya, No. 18 Radar Station located at Kiama, No. 19 Radar Station located at Bombi near Gosford and No. 101 Radar Station located on North Head, Sydney. Information would also have been passed on from No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters at Lambton and No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters at Brisbane. Other Fighter Sector Headquarters No 2. Fighter Sector Headquarters formed at New Lambton NSW on 25 February 1942. The unit commandeered the New Lambton Public School for its operations before moving to Ash Island on 3 December 1944. No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters was to be responsible for fighter aircraft control and coordination for the Newcastle and Hunter region. However it appears that 2FSHQ was non-operational and functioned as a training facility while, located at New Lambton. There is no indication that a purpose built headquarters (similar to that built in Condell Park) was constructed for this unit. No. 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters was formed at Townsville on 25 February 1942. The unit controlled fighter operations and anti-aircraft defences through North Queensland and New Guinea. The unit operated from a grammar school at North Ward until a semi underground bunker (identified as such because all the cabling was laid underground), was constructed between 1942 and 1943. The new fighter sector headquarters was built on the lower slopes of Mount Stuart and became fully operational on 20 December 1944. In 1962 or 1963 the interior of the bunker was destroyed by fire. No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was formed at Darwin on 25 February, six days after the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces. The unit was responsible for all air operations over northern Australia, from Broome to Cape York. Initially the Fighter Sector Headquarters operated out of tents and then a rough shed at Sandfly Gully, a kilometre south of the Darwin airstrip. At a later date an Operations Room was constructed at Berrimah, 15km east of Darwin. Information provided by men who worked at the site indicates that the building was a semi underground structure, that initially comprising one room but which was later expanded to two rooms. In the years following the close of WWII the exact location of the Berrimah Operations Room was lost, however, in 1995 a search for the building was initiated and by 1997 intact concrete floors of two adjacent rooms (tentatively identified as those of the Filter Room and Operations Room) had been identified on Berrimah Farm. No. 6 Fighter Sector Headquarters was former in Perth on 22 April 1942. An Operations Room was setup in the Alma Street Masonic Hall at Mt. Lawley. Between January and March 1945 the unit moved into a new underground bunker in Epsom Avenue in Belmont, Perth. The Heritage Council of Western Australia's data inventory sheet for the Belmont Bunker, describes the bunker as having moderate to high integrity, with a few alterations taking place to convert the former Fighter Sector Headquarters to a potential operations headquarters for the Civil Defence and Emergency Department (also known as the State Emergency Service). No 7 Fighter Sector Headquarters, like the other Fighter Sector Headquarters, was formed in haste (on 4 May 1942) and the Operations Room was setup in the Preston Town Hall, Melbourne. No. 7 Fighter Sector Headquarters appears to have remained at the Preston Town Hall until February 1946 when it was moved to the RAAF base, Point Cook. There does not appear to have been a purpose built headquarters (similar to the Condell Park facility) constructed for this unit. No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters was originally operated by the US Eighth Fighter Group, USAAC. When the 8th Fighter Group was reassigned to Townsville the Fighter Sector Headquarters was briefly taken over by the by the 565th Aircraft Warning Battalion, US Army. The No. 8 Fighter Sector Headquarters RAAF was formed on 3 August 1942. The unit was located on the 3rd level of the Wills Building in Ann Street Brisbane. The building has since been demolished.Information supplied by Squadron Leader Dave Burns, Office of the Air Force HistoryHistory of Cinema of Bankstown City by Kevin CorkFighter Sector (Darwin): Control of Australia's Air War 1942-45 by Graham Calley Description The Former Air Defence Headquarters (ADHQ) occupied a nine- acre site, which was enclosed by a 6 foot high (1.83m) barbwire man proofed camouflaged fence. The eastern half of the site was dissected by a gravel road which ran across the site in a north‚Äìsouth direction. The main entrance to the site was the southern termination of this road. A second entry/exit point was located at the northern end of the gravel road. The largest structure on the site was a two-storey underground bunker from where the air defence of New South Wales was controlled. In addition to the bunker, a 1942 site plan indicates that there were to be five above ground, support structures on the site. The buildings comprised: an Administration Hut, Rest Room and Kitchen Hut, a Female Latrine, a Male Latrine, and a Motor Transport Garage. The support buildings were located close to the southern boundary of this site, just west of the gravel road. Today, the Former Air Defence Headquarters lies under one of the open spaces of a housing estate built on the site in the 1970s. The area over the top and sides of the building has been landscaped concealing the building's existence. The exact location of the main entry and exit passages into the bunker are not known. Images of the interior of the bunker taken in the 1980s and 1990s, indicate that despite the fire that gutted the interior the building is structurally intact. Detailed description The following description of the Air Defence Headquarters and above ground, support buildings has been taken largely from a site plan dated 4 November 1942, floor layout and section drawings dated 3 March 1943, A plan of alterations and additions to the ADHQ (specifically the Gun Room, Army Switch and Test Room) dated 27h August 1943 and the building specification dated circa November 1942. Support buildings Four of the above ground, support buildings are shown on the 1942 site plan as being grouped around a driveway, which branched off the main gravel road in a westerly direction, near the southern boundary of the site. The fifth building (the Female Latrine) was short distance to the north of the main group. According to the 1942 site plan, the first buildings encountered along the driveway were the Administration Building on the south side of the driveway with the Rest Room and Kitchen Building directly opposite. Each of the buildings comprised two \\"c series\\" military huts. The Administration Building (C15 military huts) included office space, a General Masters store and an orderly room. A kitchen, canteen and store were at the centre of the Rest Room and Kitchen Building (C7 military huts). The Equipment Officer's Room and the officers buffet and rest room were located on one side of the kitchen-canteen complex with the other ranks buffet and rest room located on the other. The next building encountered along the driveway was the Male Latrine, which was located on the north side of the driveway and comprised a single \\"c series\\" (c.12) military hut. The latrine was divided into two areas with the officer's latrine located in the eastern end and facilities for the other ranks located in the western end of the building. Between the Rest Room and Kitchen Building and the Male Latrine, and to the north of these buildings was the Female Latrine, which also comprised a single 'c series (c.12) military hut. Unlike the Male Latrine there was no division between officers and other ranks, in facilities provided. At end of the drive was the garage comprising four posts and skillion roof. Air Defence Headquarters The Former Air Defence Headquarters is a semi-underground bunker that became fully underground after construction. The building was constructed using a \\"cut and fill\\" method. The soil excavated from digging the basement level into the natural ground, was used to cover the second-storey which was constructed above ground. The underground bunker comprised two levels, a ground floor and basement both 9' (2.75m) in height. The exterior walls of the structure were constructed of brick approximately 2' (61cm) in thickness, and were protected with earth filling. The Interior partition walls were mostly constructed of brick and timber and clad with caneite. A visitor to the bunker in the 1970s stated that the interior was painted \\"in army colours.\\" The ceiling and floors comprised reinforced concrete 4\\" (10.2cm) thick. The flat, overhanging concrete roof of the bunker, was at least 18\\" (45.7cm) thick and was designed survive a direct hit from a 500 1b bomb. A 3/4\\" (1.9cm) thick layer of asphalt was laid over the flat concrete roof as a damp course. The asphalt was then covered by at least 2' 3\\" (68.6cm) of earth fill. The entrance to the bunker appears to have been located approximately midway long the eastern facade of the bunker and was accessed via concrete passage strategically placed behind an earth embankment. An assessment of the fire protection measures required for the 1FSHQ (both temporary HQ and new building) undertaken in December 1943, noted that there were \\"emergency escapes\\" at the south and north ends of the building. An exit from the south end of the building from ground floor level, is shown on floor plans of bunker dated March 1943. Ground floor layout The floor plan indicates that the ground floor of the bunker is essentially rectangular in shape, with a small rectangular shaped extension attached to the south-west corner of the bunker. The ground floor measures approximately 97' and 1 1/4\\" along its western side (excluding the extension), 54' along its northern end, 97' and 1 1/4\\" along its the eastern side and 35' and 4 1/2\\" along its southern side (excluding the extension). Equating to an approximate size of 29.60 x 16.46 x 29.60 x 10.78 metres. The rectangular shaped extension measures 20' and 7 1/2\\" by 18' and 7 1/2\\" (approximately 6.27 x 5.68 metres) As stated above, entrance to the bunker was gained through the eastern facade of the building. After passing through the concrete passageway a visitor to the bunker would emerge in a light lock, access to the bunker was through a door in the wall immediately in front of them. Stepping through the door, a visitor would find him or herself confronting a guard, who was no doubt tasked with vetting the identity of anyone who gained access to the bunker. To the left of the entry door stretched an almost 8 metres long corridor which led to the Army Buffet, with access to AWAS Latrine, located at its southern end. Immediately in front of the entry door (across the passage) was an antechamber. A door in the north wall of the chamber led to the optical angulator. According to the floor plan, if a visitor turned right upon entering the bunker, and followed the corridor as it ran north along the eastern perimeter of the building they would find the Signals Room, which was located in the north-east corner of the bunker. The Signals Room was where incoming communications form the telephone, teleprinters and radar would be sorted before being distributed to the relevant people in the ADHQ. Turning left at the Signals Room provided access to a corridor that ran almost the length of the northern end of the ground floor. The first door encountered on the north side of the corridor was the door to the Signals Room, followed by door openings to the Cypher and Intelligence Room (where messages where encoded and decoded when security was required), the P.B.X Switch (private business telephone exchange), RAAF buffet, WAAAF Latrine, RAAF Male Latrine. At the end of the corridor (in the north-west corner of the bunker) was the Post Master General's (PMG) Frame Room. The PMG was responsible for supplying the telegraphy and telephony cabling to the ADHQ. The two-storey high Operations Room formed the centrepiece of the bunker. The floor plan indicate that the Operations Room would have been dominated by a large plotting table on which would have been painted a map with appropriate map references. Plotter (members of the WAAAF) would used plotting table to plot aircraft movements, passed through from the Filter Room. At the eastern end of the upper part of the Operations Room (ground floor level), was the Controllers Gallery. The Controller was generally a pilot of senior rank who was equipped with telephones and a radio. The radio allowed him to speak directly to fighter aircraft sent to interpret hostile aircraft. A series of four R/T (Radio Telephony) Cabinet Rooms were accessible from the eastern end of the Controllers Gallery. Projecting out over the western end, of the upper part of the Operations Room, was a small platform, that gave access to indicator boards presumably associated with the Teleprinter and Traffic Room, located immediately behind the platform. The room immediately adjacent to the south wall of the Teleprinter and Traffic Room housed Emergency Wireless Telegraph/Telephony equipment. The northern half of the bunker was dominated by the upper part of the two-storey high Volunteer Air Observers Corp (V.A.O.C) and R/D/F (Radar Directional Finder) Filter Rooms. The Filter Room was where reports of aircraft sighting were \\"filtered\\" to establish their height and bearing. The Movements Gallery, where all allied aircraft movements in the operational area were recorded, was sandwiched between the upper part of the V.A.O.C R/D/F rooms and the upper part of the Operation Room. The Guns Room (anti-aircraft guns) and the Search-Light Operations Room dominated the southern half of the ground floor of the bunker. Adjacent to the southern wall of the Guns Room was an Army Switch Room (south-west corner of the main section of the bunker) and a Test Room. Exiting through a door opening in the east wall of the Test Room provided access to a corridor that ran in an east‚Äìwest direction. Lining the south side of the corridor were three height converter booths. An additional height converter booth was located on the north side of the corridor. Immediately north of this room was the Search- Light Operations Room. At the eastern end of corridor on north side was the Male Army Latrine. Immediately north of Latrine was the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS) Latrine and Army Buffet mentioned earlier. A door opening in the south wall of the Army Switch Room (referred to above) provided access to one of two Air Conditioning Rooms, which occupied the northern end of the small rectangular extension, that projects off the south-western corner of the ground floor of the bunker. To the south of the Air Conditioning Rooms was located the power unit for the bunker and an emergency power generator. Access to the \\"emergency escape\\" exit located at the southern end of the bunker, appears to have been though an opening in the south wall of the area housing the emergency power generator. Basement According to the floor plan, the basement measures approximately along its northern end, along its western side, along the length of the eastern elevation and along its southern end. The centre of the east elevation of the basement is indented, giving the basement level the appearance of a capitalised letter \\"E\\" when viewed in plan. The Operations Room dominates the centre of the basement. At the eastern end of the Operations Room was the Intercept Officer's dais. The Intercept Officer was responsible for plotting the best course in intercept enemy aircraft. The V.A.O.C and R/D/F Filter Rooms dominate the northern half of the basement. On the south side of the Operations Room is the Naval Plot Room. The basement floor plan indicates that this room contained a long narrow plot table which occupied almost the entire length of the room. Information provided in the newspaper article written by Phil Engisch, indicates that there may have been was some adjustment to the floor plan of the ADHQ, after the March 1943 plan was produced. Engisch noted in his article that the bunker had toilet and shower facilities (whereas the plans appear to show latrines only). Engisch also recorded the presence of a small number of bedrooms, which are not shown on the 1943 floor plans of the building. It is also possible that these modifications date from the 1960s when the ADHQ was used for naval manoeuvres in the Pacific.Fighter sector (Darwin): Control of Australia's Air War 1942-1945 Condition As at 13 September 2010, a few months after the existence of the bunker was made public, in April 1971, the interior of the bunker was gutted by fire. The bunker has been accessed on several occasions since the fire. Peter Treseder, in an article published in the January-March 1994 issue of Australian Geographic, claimed that in 1987 he entered the bunker. Treseder described the bunker as being \\"...a blackened shell with lots of rooms and passages running off at various levels.\\" A group known as the Bunker Boyz entered the bunker in . Photographs of members of the group inside the bunker show the bunker to be structurally intact. Currently, there is no access to the interior of bunker. The interior of the bunker was destroyed by fire. Currently there is no access into the bunker, however images of the interior of the building indicate that it is structurally intact. Inside the bunker Inside one of the bunker hallways The Bankstown Bunker was of similar design to the underground Ops rooms of wartime England, which directed Britain's air defence fighter plane attacks on the invading German Luftwaffe. Entrance to the bunker was obtained via a concrete passageway concealed beneath a grassy slope with corridors and hallways leading to various sections.(information supplied by R. Eyers VAOC worker) The walls of the bunker were 1.5 metres thick and it could almost withstand a direct hit from a bomb. It had all the attenuated fixtures necessary to run a top secret operational defence base. It consisted of three Fixer Stations and one Homing Station. There were switchboards directing up to fifty telephone lines that went to various locations including radar stations and VAOC lookout posts which reported aircraft locations to the bunker. The bunker was also equipped with its own code room, plotting rooms, two escape tunnels and a radio transmitter room. In the centre of the bunker was a large room of about two stories in height. This was the main Ops room and control centre for all RAAF Missions in the Pacific area. The room also had a large map, (24' x 18') denoting troop positions in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. The facilities inside the bunker also had to cater for the full-time staff who lived and worked in the facility, working on a rotating roster that involved living in the bunker for two-week periods. The living quarters consisted of its own kitchen, dining area, bathrooms and bedrooms. The bunker also had its own generator and air conditioning. There are rumours of a tunnel running from the bunker to an unknown location. Modifications and dates A fire that started on 9 August 1971 destroyed the interior of the bunker. The air vents, electricity and wireless telegraphy/telephony poles mounted on the roof of the bunker were removed in association with the 1976 redevelopment of the site by the Commonwealth Department of Housing. The above ground, support buildings were also demolished as part of the redevelopment of the site in the 1970s. Location There is a small reserve between the town houses at the end of Taylor Street. It is under this hill that the bunker has been buried. The entrance to the bunker has now been sealed and the area over the top of the bunker has been landscaped to conceal its position, to the point where it is completely undetectable from the street. Other bunkers in the City of Bankstown The remote receiving station. Map date 17 February 1942. Chullora Railway Workshops and former site of WWII manufacturing plant. There is one other confirmed bunker, a \\"Remote Receiving station\\", in Bankstown.Bankstown Remote Receiving Building, Bankstown, New South Wales, during WW2 Little is known about its history though it was reportedly \\"heavily vandalised\\" in 1945. It was located in Picnic Point National Park, near the South Sydney Power station.see map ‚Äì :Image:Bankstown01.jpg According to residents of the area, it still exists. Based on a comparison of contemporary and historic maps, the Receiving Station and the present day Sydney South electricity substation share the same footprint, with the latter apparently situated directly above the former. The substation is bounded on its southwestern and southeastern sides by Henry Lawson Drive, in the Georges River National Park. It is alleged that there are several other bunkers in the Bankstown area, such as under an electricity block house on the corner of Milperra Road and Henry Lawson Drive, and a demolished bunker under Condell Park High School. During World War II, Bankstown was a hive for military activity. Bankstown Airport was home to several fighter units and several \\"dummy houses\\" existed in and around Bankstown Airport. These houses were built to make Bankstown Airport and its surrounds appear as a farm. Military personnel who worked in Bankstown lived in the area around Chapel Road (where Paul Keating Park and the council chambers are located today). Training facilities for the various plotting rooms around Sydney were also located in the area. During World War II a major wartime manufacturing plant was located in Chullora. The site once occupied of land surrounded by Rookwood Cemetery, Brunker Road, the Hume Highway and Centenary Drive. The site was said to have been the largest secret manufacturing plant in Australia which was used for the production of military weapons, plane components, tanks, and ordnance. Over two-thousand men and woman were employed to work at the factory on a daily basis. During the war the factory produced components for 700 Beaufort, 380 Beaufighter and up to 50 Lincoln aircraft. Over 54 ACI tanks were built as well as 60 General Lee tanks that were adapted for use in the Australian Military, as were local jeeps in the 70s. The factory also produced 81 cupola turrets for the British Matilda tanks. An underground \\"bunker\\" and tunnel system is apparently located on this site. It is directly under a block of flats in Davidson Street and Marlene Crescent. The entrance to the \\"bunker\\" is by steel doors set in concrete into the hillside in a railway cutting which runs from alongside the railway line parallel to Marlene Crescent at a platform called the Railwelders and which leads under the block of flats. The doors to this \\"bunker\\" were welded up in the late 1980s. The ventilation shafts that were once visible from the Hume Highway have been removed. Apart from the bunker, there is also a network of storage facilities that extend under the railway workshop. Sometime between 1977 and 1978 the steel access doors were fitted with locks (Railway SL type). The steel access doors were bolted into the side of a stormwater drain which runs along the old RTA building in Chullora, then under the Hume Hwy and eventually under the rail workshop. It has also been alleged that a tunnel approximately four miles long connects this complex with the Bankstown Bunker. Representation in popular culture The Bankstown Bunker was featured on an episode of Burke's Backyard. Don Burke conducted part of the show from inside the bunker. To enter the bunker he had to crawl in through an air vent.Video available from Bankstown Library, Local Studies collection, level 3 Heritage listing As at 27 September 2010, the former WWII Sydney Air Defence Headquarters (ADHQ) was conceived and planned at a time when the Australian military was undergoing an expansion due to the perceived threat of invasion by Japan. A purpose built, Fighter Sector Headquarters (later ADHQ) was considered key to the defence of the Sydney region. The Sydney ADHQ, which came into operation in January 1945, was an integral part of Australia's defence network during the latter stage of WWII. The former Air Defence Headquarters at Condell Park is the only facility of its type, built in NSW during WWII. The underground bunker is one of four, purpose built WW2 ADHQ in Australia, of which only three survive. The building has considerable research potential in terms of its ability to yield information (that may not be available from other sources) about the design, fabric and construction of this rare WW2 facility. The bunker is of State and potentially National significance as a representative example of an Australian designed WWII Fighter Control Unit. With the exception of the provision of a naval plotting room, the building was constructed in accordance with a standard design agreed upon by all three of the military services. It is part of a small group of Fighter Control Units, which collectively illustrates a representative type. The Former Air Defence Headquarters is associated with former service men and women of all three branches of the military, as well as former members of the No. 2 Volunteer Observers Corps (Australia). The men and women who worked in the bunker were responsible for the air defence of New South Wales, during the latter part of WWII. Despite the fact that the interior of the bunker has been damaged by fire, there is considerable community interest in the Former Air Defence Headquarters (popularly referred to as 'the Bankstown Bunker'). It has been the subject of a number of newspaper articles and it was featured on a popular television series, Burkes Backyard in the 1990s. Today information about the bunker can be found on numerous sites on the World Wide Web. Bankstown Bunker was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The former WWII Sydney Air Defence Headquarters (ADHQ) was conceived and planned at a time when the Australian military was undergoing an expansion due to the perceived threat of invasion by Japan.

Predominantly Parwan lies within the local government area (LGA) of the Shire of Moorabool, but some of Parwan lies within the LGA of the City of Melton. Parwan recorded a population of 170 at the 2016 Census. History Parwan railway station opened on the Ararat railway line in 1886 and closed in the 1980s. Parwan Railway Station Post Office opened on 1 September 1886, was renamed Parwan in 1914 and closed in 1962. Parwan Valley The Parwan Valley lies between the Brisbane Ranges, Werribee Gorge State Park and the You Yangs. Its nearest town is Bacchus Marsh. The Valley was used as farming land from the mid-1850s onwards, but after several decades of agricultural abuse the soils became extremely saline causing erosion all around the valley. By 1948 it was estimated that erosion in the valley had reduced the holding capacity of the nearby Melton Reservoir by 20%. The Victorian Government compulsorily acquired the land and has been attempting to rescue the valley ever since. At the center of the valley is White Elephant Ridge, which demonstrates the effects of soil erosion. The valley was originally a seabed. 250 million years ago after the sea receded volcanic activity caused the valley to fault and drop down leaving two large escarpments on either side. Two creeks run through the valley; Parwan Creek to the west and Spring Creek to the east.

The oldest records of written Estonian date from the 13th century. Originates Livoniae in Chronicle of Henry of Livonia contains Estonian place names, words and fragments of sentences. The Liber Census Daniae (1241) contains Estonian place and family names.The Development of Written Estonian by George Kurman The earliest extant samples of connected Estonian are the so-called Kullamaa prayers dating from 1524 and 1528.Aspects of Altaic Civilization by Denis Sinor The first known printed book is a bilingual German-Estonian translation of the Lutheran catechism by S.Wanradt and J. Koell (1535). For the use of priests an Estonian grammar was printed in German in 1637.Dictionary of Languages By Andrew Dalby; p. 182 The New Testament was translated into southern Estonian in 1686 (northern Estonian, 1715). The two dialects were united by Anton Thor Helle in a form based on northern Estonian. Writings in Estonian became more significant in the 19th century during the Estophile Enlightenment Period (1750‚Äì1840). The cultural stratum of Estonian was originally characterised by a largely lyrical form of folk poetry based on syllabic quantity. Apart from a few albeit remarkable exceptions, this archaic form has not been much employed in later times. The most outstanding achievements in this field are the national epic Kalevipoeg (Son of Kalev), written by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald (1803‚Äì1882); Gustav Suits's ballad Lapse s√ºnd (Birth of a Child); Villem Gr√ºnthal-Ridala's (1885‚Äì1942) poem Toomas ja Mai (Toomas and Mai) and three poems by August Annist (1899‚Äì1972). At a professional level, traditional folk song reached its new heyday during the last quarter of the 20th century, primarily thanks to the work of composer Veljo Tormis. In modern times Jaan KrossJaan Kross at google.books and Jaan KaplinskiJaan Kaplinski at google.books remain Estonia's best known and most translated writers. History of Estonian literature Estonian grammar (1637) by Heinrich Stahl Folklore As opposed to the recent nature of written literature, the oral tradition, found in collections of Estonian folklore, tells of the ancient pre-Northern Crusades period of independence. The first fragmentary records of Estonian folk poetry, dating from the 13th century, can be found in the Chronicle of Henry of Livonia; in the late 18th century Johann Gottfried von Herder published examples of Estonian folk songs in his anthology Volkslieder (1807). Jakob Hurt (1839‚Äì1907) was the first to start systematically collecting Estonian folklore in the second half of the 19th century, planning a multi-volume series on Estonian folklore, called Monumenta Estoniae Antiquae. Hurt coined the phrase which to this day shapes the mentality of the nation of one million people: If we cannot be great in number, then we must be great in spirit.Finno-Ugric folklore and the European written word at Estonian Literature information Center Baltic Germans Chronicles and theatrical performances by the Baltic German nobility formed the basis for local Baltic German literature which, despite the barriers of status and language, affected Estonian literature. The earliest example of Estonian language poetry dates back to 1637, a poem written by Reiner Brockmann (1609‚Äì1647), teacher of Greek at the Tallinn Gymnasium.Baltic Germans at the birth of Estonian literature at Estonian Literature information Center Otto Wilhelm Masing (1763‚Äì1832) was the first literate who had a thorough mastery of the Estonian language. Kristjan Jaak Peterson Cannot the tongue of this land In the fire of incantation Rising up to the heavens Seek for eternity? :::Kristjan Jaak Peterson Those lines have been interpreted as a claim to reestablish the birthright of the Estonian language. Kristjan Jaak Peterson (1801‚Äì1822) is considered the founder of modern Estonian poetry. He gathered his Estonian poems into two small books but never saw them published: this only occurred a hundred years after his death (although three German poems were published posthumously in 1823). One of Peterson's projects was fulfilled in his lifetime, the German version of Kristfrid Ganander's Mythologia Fennica, a dictionary of Finnish mythological words and names (the Swedish original was published in 1789). Peterson's translation of Ganander's dictionary found many readers in Estonia and abroad, becoming an important source of national ideology and inspiration for early Estonian literature. Its dominating influence extended through the first decades of the 20th century.Kristian Jaak Peterson at Estonian Literature information Center Kalevipoeg Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald The outstanding achievements in folklore imitate the epics: the national epic Kalevipoeg was compiled by doctors of Estonian origin: Friedrich Robert Faehlmann began the epic and it was finished by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald. The romantic ideology of the 19th century laid down the requirements for a national literature. The idea of an epic was the product of a humanist circle called the Learned Estonian Society (Gelehrte Estnische Gesellschaft), where Faehlmann had presented his paper in 1839 on a mythical hero called Kalewipoeg (Son of Kalew). After Faehlmann's death in 1850 the society handed the manuscripts over to Kreutzwald. The first edition of \\"Kalevipoeg\\" (1857‚Äì61) was bilingual, the German text being presented side by side with the Estonian original. A popular Estonian edition in a single volume followed in 1862.Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald at Estonian Literature information Center Lydia Koidula (1843‚Äì1886) was the initiator of a tradition of Estonian patriotic and women's poetry during the era. Late 19th early 20th century In the late 19th-century a poet emerged who profoundly affected Estonian poetry as a whole ‚Äì Juhan Liiv (1864‚Äì1913). During the last decade of the 19th century, a contemporary of Liiv's, Eduard Vilde (1865‚Äì1933), gave a realistic direction to Estonian prose.Literature in the 19th century at Estonian Literature information Center With the formation of the group Noor-Eesti (Young Estonia) in 1905, led by the poet Gustav Suits (1883‚Äì1956), the linguist and poet Villem Gr√ºnthal-Ridala (1885‚Äì1942) and the reformer of the Estonian language Johannes Aavik (1880‚Äì1973), Estonian literature gained a new intellectual impetus. The most prominent prose writer of the time, still widely read today, was Oskar Luts (1887‚Äì1953). Another significant author was Jaan Oks (1884‚Äì1918).The poetry of Ernst Enno (1875‚Äì1934) gained popularity much later. The rationality of the Young Estonians was counterbalanced by the group of writers from the Siuru movement, established in 1917. The central and peripheral poets of Siuru were: August Gailit (1891‚Äì1960), Friedebert Tuglas (1886‚Äì1971), Johannes Semper (1892‚Äì1970), Artur Adson (1889‚Äì1977), August Alle (1890‚Äì1952), Henrik Visnapuu (1890‚Äì1951), Peet Aren (1889‚Äì1970), Otto Krusten (1888‚Äì1937) and Marie Under (1883‚Äì1980). The magazine Eesti Kirjandus (Estonian Literature) was founded in 1906, and Eesti Kirjanduse Selts (Estonian Literary Society) in 1907. 1918‚Äì1940 After the establishment of the Republic of Estonia, professionalism and diversity in literature were followed by the emergence of literary institutions. The Estonian Writers Union was founded in 1922; the literary monthly Looming (Creation) first appeared in 1923 and is still the main periodical of its sort in Estonia. The Cultural Endowment Fund started work in 1925 and is the major provider of grants in the arts in the present- day Republic of Estonia. The prevailing tendency in prose writing between the two World Wars was realism. The most prominent writer of the era is Anton Hansen Tammsaare (1878‚Äì1940). His five volume epic novel T√µde ja √ïigus (Truth and Justice, 1926‚Äì1933) is considered one of the major works of Estonian literature. Other prominent prose writers were August M√§lk (1900‚Äì1987), Karl Ristikivi (1912‚Äì1977). August Gailit, the incurable romantic, appeared on the literary scene along with the Siuru group. The Arbujad (\\"Soothsayers\\") was a small but influential group of poets who began collaborating in 1938 at the behest of poet and author Ants Oras (1900‚Äì1982) and included: Betti Alver (1906‚Äì1989), Uku Masing (1909‚Äì1985), Mart Raud (1903‚Äì1980), Kersti Merilaas (1913‚Äì1986), Bernard Kangro (1910‚Äì1994), Heiti Talvik (1904‚Äì1947), August Sang (1914‚Äì1969) and Paul Viiding (1904‚Äì1962). While group's poetic works tended to be eclectic, there was a common desire among members to reach a deeper intellectual and emotional plane. The Arbujad poets were for the freedom and independence of the people while being against ideological coercion and totalitarian concepts. Post World War II After the Second World War Estonian literature was split in two for almost half a century. A number of prominent writers who spent the war years in Estonia fled from Soviet forces to Germany in 1944 (Visnapuu) or to Sweden, either directly or via Finland (Suits, Under, Gailit, Kangro, M√§lk, Ristikivi). Many of those who remained behind and did not follow the ideology of the Soviet occupying power suffered either death in Siberia (Talvik and playwright Hugo Raudsepp) or a combination of repression, a ban on publication and interior exile (Tuglas, Alver, Masing). Despite the modest circumstances of the war and post-war years, creative activity and publishing started almost immediately, both in the temporary stopovers in Finland, and in the refugee camps in Sweden and Germany. In Exile In 1945 the Estonian Writers' Union in Exile was founded in Stockholm. In 1950 Bernard Kangro began publishing the cultural magazine Tulimuld in Lund (published until 1993). Eesti Kirjanike Kooperatiiv, the largest Estonian-language publishing house in exile, was set up and its method of book distribution secured the continuity of literary life on an institutional level and on a global scale, except in the Soviet-controlled homeland. Estonians abroad also did their best to introduce Estonian literature to the world: in the USA, Ivar Ivask (1927‚Äì1992) edited World Literature Today in which he published numerous articles and reviews about Estonian literature. The poetry collection by surrealist Ilmar Laaban (1921‚Äì2000) was at first the only modernist work, until 1953 when Karl Ristikivi, essentially a conservative writer, published his novel The Night of the Souls. Arved Viirlaid's (1922) novel Seitse kohtup√§eva (Seven Days of Trial, 1957) was a detour into modernism. Ilmar Jaks (1923) became a more consistent cultivator of the technique of the modern novel. The subject matter of literary output was greatly enriched by descriptions of the countries where various writers had settled, like Karl Rumor (1886‚Äì1971) in Brazil, or Gert Helbem√§e (1913‚Äì1974) in England. In the second half of the 1950s Kalju Lepik (1920‚Äì1999) was a poet in exile who rose to prominence alongside Bernard Kangro. Kalju Lepik's first visit to his homeland in 1990 and the publication of his last collections of poetry there, symbolises the end of the split. Behind the Iron Curtain In Estonia a relaxation of the strictures of the Soviet regime after the death of Stalin opened the way for various Estonian writers: Minni Nurme (1917‚Äì1994), Jaan Kross (1920‚Äì2007) Artur Alliksaar (1923‚Äì1966), Ain Kaalep (born 1921), Kersti Merilaas (1916‚Äì1986) and Ellen Niit (born 1928). Against that background a new \\"Cassette Generation\\" emerged in 1962‚Äì1967 (so-called because of the small poetry chapbooks which appeared together in small cardboard boxes termed kassett in Estonian). Jaan Kaplinski (born 1941) was greatly inspired by Oriental religion and nature. Other authors of note were Hando Runnel (born 1938), Viivi Luik (born 1946), Mats Traat (born 1936), Andres Ehin (born 1940) and Ilmar Laaban. The political stagnation that followed the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968 was reflected in Paul-Eerik Rummo's initially banned minimalist collection. The collection did not appear in its entirety until 1989. So-called alternative literature was disseminated in manuscript form, the most significant authors in this field being the dissident poet Johnny B. Isotamm (born 1939) and the prose writer Toomas Vint (born 1944). The most remarkable poet of the 1960s and 1970s was Juhan Viiding (pseudonym J√ºri √údi, 1948‚Äì1995, son of former Arbujad member, poet Paul Viiding), whose first collection \\"Nerve Print\\" appeared in 1971. Despite all attempts to ban it, the popular and song-like nature of Hando Runnel's patriotic verse secured its huge circulation. His collection \\"The Purple of the Red Evenings\\", 1982 was allowed into print but the publication of any reviews in the press remained forbidden.The split in Estonian literature at Estonian Literature information Center 1991‚Äì2001 The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the restoration of Republic of Estonia's independence. The two Estonian Writers' Unions were merged in 2000. In a way, Emil Tode‚Äôs (pen name of T√µnu √ïnnepalu, 1962) \\"Piiririik\\" (\\"Border State\\") marked the beginning of a new era in 1993. The novel claimed its place beside the internationally recognised and translated works by Kross or Kaplinski. \\"Border State\\" also raised the topic of \\"Euro- literature\\", where one of the central issues is the wanderings of Estonians abroad, their search for an identity in a world with open borders.Estonian literature during the last decade ‚Äì Stars and trends The intertextual poetry of Jaan Undusk (born 1958), Mati Unt and Viivi Luik and Hasso Krull (born 1964) prepared the ground for a bold new Estonian literature. The most remarkable prose writers of the younger generation of recent years are Andrus Kivir√§hk (born 1970), Karl-Martin Sinij√§rv (born 1971), Mehis Heinsaar (born 1973), Peeter Sauter (born 1962) or J√ºri Ehlvest (1967‚Äì2006), who deepened the subjects and topics opened up by √ïnnepalu in a way both comical and cryptic. Jaan Kross and Jaan Kaplinski remain Estonia's best known and most translated writers, although in recent years the short stories of Eeva Park and the novels of T√µnu √ïnnepalu and Ervin √ïunapuu have also been enjoying moderate success in Germany and Scandinavia.Mission Estonia. On Estonian Literature in Finnish Jaan Kross has been tipped for the Nobel Prize for Literature on several occasions. On his return from the labour camps and internal exile in Russia, where he spent nine long years (1946‚Äì1954) as a political prisoner, Kross breathed new life into Estonian poetry. Kross began writing prose in the latter half of the 1960s.Jaan Kross at Estonian Literature information Center Jaan Kaplinski has become the central and most productive Modernist in Estonian poetry. Kaplinski has written essays, plays and has translated. He has lectured in Vancouver, Calgary, Ljubljana, Trieste, Taipei, Stockholm, Bologna and Cologne, London and Edinburgh. He has been Writer-in-Residence at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth.Jaan Kaplinski at Estonian Literature information Center The new century The beginning of the 21st century has been fruitful for Estonian literature. Blossoming out of the waning nineties; a new, vibrant generation of poets appeared. J√ºrgen Rooste (1979), Ivar Sild (1977), Wimberg (pen name of Jaak Urmet, 1979) and Kristiina Ehin (1977) have all distinctive voices combined with a profound knowledge of both Estonian and world literature. Rooste is definitely the most socially-involved and \\"beat- like\\" of them all.J√ºrgen Rooste ‚Äì Love and Pain Sild proclaims his gay outlook, Wimberg creates absurd landscapes through the use of childlike language and styleWimberg and Ehin maintains the tradition of the \\"great female poet\\" of Estonia.Kristiina Ehin's Drums of Silence on a New Moon Morning But prose also flourishes. Over recent years, the work of Rein Raud has won him both numerous awards at home and international acclaim. His most notable books include \\"The Reconstruction\\", the story of a dying father trying to find out the circumstances of his daughter's suicide in a religious cult (2012, in English 2017, Dalkey Archive Press) and \\"The Brother\\" (2008, in English 2016, Open Letter Books), called by the author \\"a spaghetti Western in poetic prose\\". Andrus Kivir√§hk has skilfully combined his comic talent and ethno-fantasy in \\"The Man Who Spoke Snakish\\" (2007, in English 2015, Grove Press). Indrek Hargla is a prolific writer of several kinds of genre fiction including sci-fi, fantasy and crime. His reputation relies mainly on his Apothecary Melchior series, set in medieval Tallinn. Besides Kaur Kender (1971), whose finest hour was in 1998 with the debut novel \\"Iseseisvusp√§ev\\" (\\"Independence Day\\"), a younger generation is appearing.

I played professional soccer on the weekends, worked during the week and went to evening classes at St. John's University Law School.\\"Philip Slone - The Lone Survivor A little background is required to understand the next two years of Slone‚Äôs career. The ESL was created during the ‚ÄúSoccer War‚Äù which pitted the American Soccer League and the USFA. After three ASL teams were expelled from the league, they joined several other teams to form the ESL. This league lasted a season and a half before merging with the ASL at the end of the ‚ÄúSoccer War‚Äù. New York Hakoah was owned by Maurice Vandeweghe, who also owned the New York Giants of the ASL. The merger of the ESL and ASL meant that Vandeweghe now owned to teams in the same league. League rules forbid that, so Vandeweghe sold Hakoah. When he did, Slone jumped to Vandeweghe's other team, the Giants. In June 1930, Slone left the U.S. to play in the 1930 FIFA World Cup. He and his teammates returned to discover the ASL had experienced a reshuffling of teams in their absence. As a result, Slone left the Giants, now named the Nationals, to sign with the Hakoah All- Stars which had been formed by the merger of his old team, New York Hakoah of the ESL and Brooklyn Hakoah of the ASL. The All Stars played until 1932 when they folded at the end of the season. Slone then moved to New York Brookhattan. The ASL folded in 1933 but was immediately replaced by a second American Soccer League. Slone continued to play with Brookhattan in the second ASL until his retirement in 1940. National team Slone earned one cap with the U.S. national team in 1930 when he traveled to Uruguay for the 1930 FIFA World Cup. However, his cap did not come during the finals, but in an August 17, 1930 loss to Brazil following the cup.USA - Details of International Matches 1885-1969 Slone was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1986. He died in West Palm Beach, Florida in 2003. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of the inaugural American World Cup team.https://www.fifa.com/theclub/news/newsid=71875/index.html References https://www.fifa.com/theclub/news/newsid=71875/ External links * National Soccer Hall of Fame profile * FIFA profile of Slone Category:1907 births Category:1930 FIFA World Cup players Category:2003 deaths Category:Sportspeople from New York City Category:American soccer players Category:Soccer players from New York (state) Category:United States men's international soccer players Category:Eastern Professional Soccer League (1928‚Äì29) players Category:New York Hakoah players Category:American Soccer League (1921‚Äì1933) players Category:New York Giants (soccer) players Category:Hakoah All-Stars players Category:American Soccer League (1933‚Äì1983) players Category:New York Brookhattan players Category:National Soccer Hall of Fame members Category:Association football midfielders ","title":"Philip Slone"},{"id":"13044044","text":"Douglas C.

Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit. To which is added, the history of the philosophical doctrine concerning the origin of the soul, and the nature of matter; with its influence on Christianity, especially with respect to the doctrine of the pre-existence of Christ. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1777. Between 1774 and 1778, while he was serving as an assistant to Lord Shelburne, Priestley wrote five major metaphysical works, in which he outlined his materialist philosophy, even though such a position \\"entailed denial of free will and the soul.\\"Tapper, 316.

London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1774. Priestley had strongly suggested that there was no mind-body duality. Such a position shocked and angered many of his readers who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist. In order to explain his belief more clearly Priestley wrote the Disquisitions, which claimed that both \\"matter\\" and \\"force\\" are active, and therefore that objects in the world and the mind must be made of the same substance. Moreover, he contended that discussing the soul was impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot access the divine. He therefore denied the materialism of the soul while simultaneously claiming its existence. Although he buttressed his arguments with familiar scholarship and ancient authorities, including scripture, he was labeled an atheist and at least a dozen hostile refutations of the work were published by 1782.Schofield, Vol. 2, 59‚Äì76; Gibbs, 99‚Äì100; Holt, 112-24; Tapper, 317.

The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated; being an appendix to the Disquisitions relating to matter and spirit. To which is added an answer to the Letters on materialism, and on Hartley‚Äôs Theory of the mind. London: Printed for J. Johnson, 1777. Introduction Between 1774 and 1778, while serving as an assistant to Lord Shelburne, Priestley wrote a series of five major metaphysical works, arguing for a materialist philosophy even though such a position \\"entailed denial of free will and the soul.\\"Tapper, 316. Continuing the arguments he had started in The Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry‚Ä¶ Dr. Beattie's Essay‚Ä¶ and Dr. Oswald's Appeal (1774) and Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), Priestley published The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), an \\"appendix\\" to the Disquisitions that \\"suggests that materialism and determinism are mutually supporting.\\"Tapper, 318. Priestley explicitly stated that humans had no free will: \\"all things, past, present, and to come, are precisely what the Author of nature really intended them to be, and has made provision for.\\"Qtd. in Schofield, Vol. 79. He was the first to claim that what he called \\"philosophical necessity\\" (a position akin to absolute determinism) is consonant with Christianity. His philosophy was based on his theological interpretation of the natural world; like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, but because a benevolent God created these laws, Priestley argued, the world and the men in it will eventually be perfected. He argued that the associations made in a person's mind were a necessary product of their lived experience because Hartley's theory of associationism was analogous to natural laws such as gravity. Priestley contends that his necessarianism can be distinguished from fatalism and predestination because it relies on natural law. Isaac Kramnick points out the paradox of Priestley's positions: as a reformer, he argued that political change was essential to human happiness and urged his readers to participate, but he also claimed in works such as Philosophical Necessity that humans have no free will.Kramnick, 16.Schofield, 77‚Äì91; Garrett, 55; Tapper, 319; Sheps, 138. Reception Philosophical Necessity influenced the 19th-century utilitarians John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, who were drawn to its determinism. The philosopher A. Spir believed that the work had so clearly refuted the notion of free will, that it is unnecessary to discuss the issue anymore. In a similar fashion, Arthur Schopenhauer commented that \\"no writer has presented the necessity of acts of will so thoroughly and convincingly as Priestley ... If anyone is not convinced by this supremely clearly and accessibly written book, his understanding must really be paralysed by prejudices.\\", and that the work contributed to Kant taking the complete necessity of acts of will as a settled matter to which no further doubt could pertain.

By passion, Lord Sayyid is a recognized researcher of political science and Islam,https://sayyidamiruddin.com/sayyid/ trained for twelve years under the tutelage of one of the world's leading authorities on classical Islam of the 20th century ‚Äì Grand Shaykh Nazim al-Qubrusi. Sayyid was recognized with over twenty-three degrees for his research by Grand Shaykh Nazim al- Qubrusi.https://sayyidamiruddin.com/degrees/ The late Grand Shaykh Nazim was the second most influential Muslim in the world according to a 2009 Reuters online poll,https://ahmedamiruddin.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/reuters2.jpg and regularly recognized among the world's 50 most influential Muslims. In the annual publication, The 500 Most Influential Muslims: he was ranked 49th, 49th, 48th, 45th, and 42nd in the 2009-2013 editions, respectively.‚ÄúThe 500 Most Influential Muslims‚Äù, 2009-2013 According to Amiruddin, religiopolitical radicalization from its earliest stages is a neurochemical phenomenon driven by religion addiction.https://alcyonetechnology.ca/about/ Sayyid's program consisted of three components: a twelve step psycho-social intervention, proliferation of a relevant counter-narrative, and neurobiological support. According to Sayyid, global radicalization prevention programs require all three of these components to succeed. In his view, any radicalization prevention program which does not include a neurobiological support system in addition to its psycho-social intervention and counter-narrative program for its candidates cannot be accepted as being legitimate nor actually effective in preventing religiopolitical radicalization. In 2010, Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin founded ASFC Spiritual Wellness Centre. and Qedar.org He pioneered a unique method of psycho-spiritual rehabilitation therapy based on the Sufi approach, and applied his methodology to create a twelve-step radicalization prevention program in response to the 2006 Toronto terrorism case. Recognition Sayyid ‚Äôs radicalization prevention efforts in Canada have had a global impact, and were recognized by the Canadian government,https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/committee/403/anti/07mn-e the United States government through the American ambassador to Canada, and were mentioned favorably in the WikiLeaks Cables.https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09TORONTO151_a.htmlhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09TORONTO213_a.htmlhttps://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09OTTAWA492_a.html According to a letter addressed to Amiruddin from the Ambassador of the United States of America to Canada, ‚Äú...The United States appreciates the voices of concerned citizens and leaders in Canada and around the world who denounce terrorism and extremism and we hope your organization will continue to speak up in defense of liberty and moderation.

In 2006, he founded the concept of a systematic de-radicalization program as a counter- radicalization program initiative in Canada in response to the 2006 Toronto-18 terror plot. His program is specifically tailored to undermine the ideological underpinnings of extremist ideology. Over 50 mosques and Islamic organizations throughout Canada have since privately endorsed his de- radicalization program to their congregations. Today, he will share with us the main components of the 12-step program, and he has agreed to take questions. I welcome our guest here today. Much of our testimony today has been about how to analyze what is happening and how to assist with policing and coordination. Our guest is one Canadian who is working to prevent bad things from happening, and I think his advice and insights will be of immense value to our committee.‚Äù According to The Honourable Doctor Keith Martin, P.C. M.P, MD, Founding Executive Director of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health in Washington, D.C., USA: \\"‚Ä¶ There is a solution. The Canadian government must work with moderate Islamic leaders to diffuse this threat. Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin is one of those leaders. He has a 12‚Äêstep de‚Äêradicalization program that focuses on creating a counter‚Äênarrative ‚Ä¶ and ensuring that those suffering from psychiatric illnesses get the medical treatment they need‚Ä¶‚Äù.https://sayyidamiruddin.com/2011/04/02/ Wilfrid Laurier University's \\"The Laurier M.A. Journal of Religion and Culture\\" writes, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the establishment of Amiruddin‚Äôs Al Sunnah Foundation and the twelve-step program‚Ä¶can be seen as inspiring and reinforcing the flurry of activism that has continued to emerge from within the community since mid-2009...This growing anti-jihadist activism includes Canadian-based sheikh Tahir ul-Qadri independently issuing a 600-page document in London in March 2010, thoroughly refuting any potential theological justifications for Islamic extremism and going so far as to state that terrorists and suicide bombers are destined for damnation\\". Dr. Tahir ul- Qadri's historic six-hundred page fatwa against terrorism was published and recognized by the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation), an organization representing 56 Muslim states, and the collective voice of the Muslim world, with permanent delegations to the United Nations and the European Union.http://www.oic-cdpu.org/en/page/?pID=12 Twelve-step Program Amiruddin's counter-radicalization program focuses primarily on a twelve-step psycho-social intervention, counter-narrative programming,https://alcyonetechnology.ca/ard/ and neurobiological support was specifically tailored to undermine the ideological underpinnings of extremist ideology. Amiruddin first presented his 12-step radicalization prevention program before Canadian politicians at Canada 2020 with Al Gore in June 2006 in Mont Tremblanc, and follow up meetings specifically regarding the program and its goals were held with community leaders. In December 2008, Amiruddin presented it before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and community leaders. Following Amiruddin's 2008 presentation to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, in 2009, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police published a report on \\"Terrorism and Language\\" stating: \\"...many contemporary terrorist movements- including Afghanistan‚Äôs Taliban and al-Qai‚Äôda - have theological roots in Wahhabism, a sect that forms the ‚Äústate orthodoxy‚Äù of contemporary Saudi Arabia. Wahhabism is a particularly strict interpretation of Islam that adheres to the Salafist notion that ‚Äúpure‚Äù Islam must be rooted in the teachings of the ‚Äúearly fathers‚Äù...‚ÄúWahhabist‚Äù and ‚ÄúSalafist‚Äù have been used extensively to define particular types of terrorism...elements of Wahabbism could give rise to a mindset that includes extremist action - as 9/11 itself demonstrates...\\". Amiruddin was interviewed by Fox News about the program in Feb of 2009, and in June 2009, the Toronto Star, Canada's largest newspaper, published a story about Amiruddin's program and the effect it has had on the lives of 'would be radicals', stating, 'Islamic ‚Äòdetox‚Äô saved student from terror cell'. Special Senate Committee on Anti-terrorism On Oct 4, 2010 Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin was asked to appear before the Senate of Canada's Special Senate Committee on Anti- terrorismhttps://sencanada.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/403/anti/pdf/07issue.pdf to discuss details of his program and share with the committee his insight on the homegrown radicalization process. Amiruddin recommended the proliferation of an integral cultural counter-narrative in the context of being Canadian, and testified before the committee: \\"Much different from the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict equation, the radicalization process of Western‚Äêraised individuals is not triggered by oppression, perceived suffering, revenge or desperation; rather, this radicalization is motivated specifically by ideology. The jihadi, or the Salafi-jihadist ideology is the ideology that drives young men and women born and raised in the West to carry out \\"autonomous jihad\\" via acts of terrorism against their home countries. While many followers of this particular stream of Islam may not directly advocate jihad via acts of terrorism, or may even condemn terrorism wholly, the fact remains that this is the only stream within the Islamic tradition that is directly conducive to the radicalization process and the sanctioning of \\"autonomous jihad\\" via acts of terrorism. The Salafi ideology has served as the inspiration for numerous homegrown groups, including the Madrid 2004 bombers (2004 Madrid train bombings), Amsterdam's Hofstad Group, London's July 2005 bombers (7 July 2005 London bombings), and specifically the Toronto 18 group arrested in 2006...In order to create and sustain effective de- radicalization strategies, a major component of counter-terrorism involves the prevention of radicalization through fostering committed partnerships with expert groups within a given community who are working for the de- legitimization of violent extremism. The proliferation of an integral Islamic counter-narrative in the context of being Canadian, and the integration of people at the individual, social, and political level...The success of our implementation strategy is based on a group of professionals and experts that we deal with to implement our strategy...For example, we have medical practitioners as advisers in the implementation of our program, such as psychologists and psychiatrists, who can provide guidance and advice on medical and other factors that may be enablers in the radicalization process, which may be surprising to many. Specifically, we deal with hyperreligiosity, which is a diagnosed symptom of bi-polar disorder treated with prescription drugs...\\". Psycho-social Intervention When Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN secretary general's special representative for children and armed conflict, urged the U.S. military commission to allow Omar Khadr to return to Canada to be rehabilitated, rather than be detained further in a U.S. facility, Amiruddin, told CBC News in a television interview he believed his 12-step program, with the assistance of his team of psychologists and psychiatrists, social workers, Islamic and Interfaith clergy, academics, and life coaches trained in Neuro-Linguistic Programming could rehabilitate Khadr. Support for Palestinian statehood Lord Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin with the Supreme Shari'ah Judge of Palestine, President Mahmoud Abbas' Advisor on Religious and Islamic Affairs, and Chairman of the Supreme Council for Shari'ah Justice Dr. Mahmoud Al-Habbash at the mausoleum of Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat in Ramallah, Palestine. Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin accepts the view of King Abdullah II of Jordan that Palestinian injustice fuels Middle East violence, which in turn drives global radicalization.http://www.arabnews.com/node/1208521/middle-east As such, he endorses Palestinian right to self-determination and supports the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, territorially contiguous Palestinian state, and like the Hashemites of Jordan also recognizes Israel's right to live in peace with its neighbours.

Assault Allegations In June 2016 he was charged with two counts of sexual assault, two counts of extortion, two counts of non-consensual distribution of intimate images and sexual exploitation. Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin was accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl and a 20-year- old woman in Peel Region. Peel police say the 37-year-old man committed the offences while he was practicing as a religious healer. It was alleged the offences occurred over an eight-year period starting in 2008. Police said he had operated as a religious healer for several years in the Brampton, Mississauga and Burlington area, and appears to target the followers of Sufism. Lord Amiruddin maintained his innocence of any criminal wrongdoing and categorically denied all allegations against him of criminal behavior as false.http://therahnuma.com/all-criminal-allegations-against-prominent- canadian-hyderabadi-collapse-ontario-judge-drops-all-charges// Furthermore, according to police disclosure neither one of his accusers ever claimed to be fifteen years old to the police.http://therahnuma.com/all-criminal- allegations-against-prominent-canadian-hyderabadi-collapse-ontario-judge- drops-all-charges/ The trial was cancelled by an Ontario judge on November 15, 2017 and all criminal charges against him collapsed because of a serious violation of his s. 11(b) Charter Rights. On November 15, 2017 at 10:00 AM in the Ontario Court of Justice, Brampton, all criminal charges against Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin were dropped by an Ontario judge. This day coincided with the Palestinian Declaration of Independence. The honorable judge stayed all criminal charges against Lord Amiruddin and cancelled the trial because Peel Regional Police repeatedly delayed to provide disclosure of evidence of the allegations to the defense. The full text of the ruling was not made available by the judge who dropped the charges because of unconstitutional delay and serious violation of his s. 11(b) Charter Rights. Claims of Conspiracy, Damages Against Accusers After all criminal accusations and charges against Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin were collapsed by an Ontario judge on November 15, 2017 in an Ontario Court of Justice, Brampton, ON, Amiruddin filed a litigation lawsuit in an Ontario Superior Court of Justice against his accusers.http://therahnuma.com/shock-claim-amiruddins-accuser-was- paid-46000-00-cdn-days-before-making-sexual-assault-allegations/ According to shocking details from an Ontario Superior Court of Justice litigation document filed on behalf of Amiruddin, one of the women who accused Sayyid Ahmed Amiruddin of sexually assaulting her over a period of eight years was paid $46,000.00 CDN days before she filed a complaint with the Peel Regional Police against him. Lord Amiruddin is seeking an Order in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for damages against his accusers in the amount of nearly $300,000.00 CDN.

Bush signs a law in 2005 to place a statue of Rosa Parks at the U.S. Capitol. A signing ceremony is a ceremony in which a document of importance is signed (approved). Typically the document is a bill passed by a legislature, thus becoming a law by an executive's signature. However, the document may also be, for example, an executive order, international agreement, or a veto statement that invalidates a legislative measure. \\"The President should have had the veto signing ceremony at the local gas station.\\" The act of electronically signing a document may be referred to as a signing ceremony. The act of physically signing a signature is seen as adding gravitas to the moment. History Signing ceremonies are derived from ceremonies that occurred when the British monarch gave Royal Assent to acts of Parliament. Signing ceremonies became an aspect of American politics. Signing ceremonies may be performed by U.S. state governors upon signing a state document (generally an act of the state legislature, making it into state law) or by the President of the United States (generally making an act of Congress into federal law). The President typically invites Congressional leaders who were instrumental in the bill's passage as well as interested community members. One practice is to use multiple pens and honor individuals by giving them the pens used to form the signature. For the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, President Lyndon B. Johnson used more than 75 pens. The pens were then given to attending dignitaries and supporters of the bill, including Rosa Parks, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey, Everett McKinley Dirksen and Martin Luther King Jr. Signing ceremonies are associated with acts that are viewed as legislative triumphs for the executive. Conversely, laws that are passed reluctantly or are controversial are often signed into law quietly and privately without ceremony. Non-government usage Signing ceremonies may be performed by non-government signatories for purposes including the signing of a contract or will. Signing ceremonies can attest to significant events, such as a beam-signing ceremony to mark a construction milestone.

Priestley wrote a series of important metaphysics works during the years he spent serving as Lord Shelburne's assistant and companion. In a set of five works written during this time he argued for a materialist philosophy, even though such a position \\"entailed denial of free will and the soul.\\"Tapper, 316. As Shelburne's companion, Priestley had accompanied him on a tour of Europe in 1774; they spent quite a bit of time in Paris and the unsettling conversations Priestley had with the French philosophes there prompted him to write Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever, the last of his series of major metaphysical works.Schofield, 4‚Äì11. Priestley recalled the trip in his Memoirs: > As I chose on all occasions to appear as a Christian, I was told by some of > them [philosophes], that I was the only person they had ever met with, of > whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe > Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that > they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what > Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and > abroad, I thought I should be able to combat their prejudices with some > advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‚ÄòLetters to a > Philosophical Unbeliever‚Äô, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a > providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [sic] of > Christianity.Priestley, Autobiography, 111. In Letters, he continued to defend his thesis, begun in Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit and The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated, that materialism and determinism can be reconciled with a belief in God. The text addresses those whose faith is shaped by books and fashion; Priestley draws an analogy between the skepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses. He again argues for the existence of God using what Schofield calls \\"the classic argument from design ... leading from the necessary existence of a creator-designer to his self-comprehension, eternal existence, infinite power, omnipresence, and boundless benevolence.\\"Schofield, 39. In the three volumes, Priestley discusses, among many other works, Baron d'Holbach's Systeme de la Nature. He claimed that d'Holbach's \\"energy of nature,\\" though it lacked intelligence or purpose, was really a description of God. Priestley believed that David Hume's style in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) was just as dangerous as its ideas; he feared the open-endedness of the Humean dialogueTapper, 320; Priestley, Autobiography, 111; Schofield, 37‚Äì42; Holt, 93-94; 139-42.

Its creation was the result of cooperation between at least 30 agencies or governmental entities.NWRS - Glacial Ridge NWR The creation of the refuge was spearheaded by The Nature Conservancy, and the initial endowment of of land was donated by the Conservancy. In light of its planned final size of , it is described by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as \\"the largest tallgrass prairie and wetland restoration project in U.S. history.\\" Location The Glacial Ridge NWR is located six miles (10 km) west of Mentor, Minnesota, or about twelve miles (19 km) east of Crookston, Minnesota. Description From its original area of , the refuge is slated to grow to at least . Of this planned area previously existed in an unplowed state, and a further has been seeded with native prairie grasses. In addition, more than 100 wetlands have been restored.The Nature Conservancy in Minnesota - Glacial Ridge Project The restoration of native tallgrass prairie is ongoing, and will require years of effort. Purpose The following five items are the main objectives of the refuge:Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge *Strive to maintain diversity and increase abundance of waterfowl and other migratory bird species dependent of prairie wetland and grassland habitats *Conserve, manage, and restore the diversity and viability of native fish, wildlife and plant populations associated with tallgrass prairie and prairie wetlands *Work in partnership with others to restore or enhance native tallgrass prairie, prairie wetlands and unique plant communities *Restore, enhance, and protect water quality and quantity that approach natural hydrologic functions *Provide for compatible wildlife-dependent recreational uses by the public, emphasizing increased understanding of the northern tallgrass prairie ecosystem and the mission of the National Wildlife Refuge System Wildlife This prairie wetland complex hosts a great diversity of plant species. Of special interest is the federally threatened western prairie fringed orchid. Other communities found at the preserve include wet and mesic tallgrass prairie and gravel prairie, willow thickets, mixed prairie, sedge meadow, aspen woodlands and emergent marsh. Prairie species at Pembina Trail Preserve include prairie Junegrass, purple prairie clover, big and little bluestem and mat muhly. When restored, Glacial Ridge will likely provide habitat for several of the same species present at Pembina Trail Preserve, which harbors more than 73 bird species, 35 butterfly species, 11 mammal species, three amphibian species and one reptile species. Birds like the sandhill crane, sharp-tailed grouse, upland sandpiper, northern harrier, marbled godwit, Wilson's phalarope, sora rail, marsh wren, and clay colored sparrow may soon find their habitat expanded at Glacial Ridge. In recent years, bald eagles, a peregrine falcon and a whooping crane have also been spotted. In 2007, a nesting pair of burrowing owls and their two owlets were sighted on a restored prairie. Whitetail deer, moose, and prairie grouse are present within the NWR. It has also become a major nesting and breeding area for waterfowl. The return of the greater prairie chicken is one of the goals of the refuge. Hunting is permitted within the boundaries of the refuge.

Watkins (born May 30, 1927), is the Earl V. Moore Professor (Emeritus) of Music History and Musicology at the University of Michigan and a specialist in the study of Renaissance and 20th-century music. Biography Born in McPherson, Kansas, Watkins served in the United States Army from 1944-46. During this period he was enrolled in the ASTP engineering program at the University of Oklahoma, the Japanese language programs at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Minnesota, and was later stationed in Tokyo with the \\"Allied Translator and Interpreter Section\\" of MacArthur's General Headquarters. Immediately after the war in 1947 he briefly attended North Texas State University where his first organ teacher, Helen Hewitt, directed him to the field of musicology. He received a B.A. (1948) and M.Mus (1949) from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. from the Eastman School of Music, University of Rochester, in 1953. Watkins was the recipient of a Fulbright scholarship at London and Oxford, 1953-54. He studied organ with Jean Langlais in Paris in 1956 and analysis and organ at Fontainebleau with Nadia Boulanger, who commissioned him to play the Poulenc Organ Concerto for the composer. His teaching career began at Southern Illinois University from 1954‚Äì58, and continued at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, 1958-63. In 1963 he moved to the University of Michigan, where he taught until retiring in 1996. Awards In addition to the Fulbright Award, Watkins has received an American Council of Learned Societies Grant, and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Michigan Institute for the Humanities. He has published numerous articles, reviews and editions, and is co-editor of the complete works of Gesualdo. His critical study of that composer, Gesualdo: The Man and His Music (1973), which carries a Preface by Igor Stravinsky, was a 1974 National Book Award nominee. It was translated into Hungarian in 1980 and into German in 2000, and a second revised English edition was published in 1990. In 2005, he was awarded the Premio Internazionale Carlo Gesualdo and was elected as an Honorary Member of the American Musicological Society. Work Watkins's editions of the works of Sigismondo d'India and Carlo Gesualdo have been recorded by numerous international groups, including the Deller Consort, the Consort of Musicke, the Tallis Scholars, La Venexiana, The Kassiopeia Quintet, and Les Arts Florissants. His text Soundings (1988) offers a synthetic overview of music in the 20th century, and his book Pyramids at the Louvre (1994) argues the idea of collage as a foundation for musical Modernism and a catalyst for the rise of Postmodernism. Watkins‚Äôs book, Proof Through the Night: Music and the Great War (2003), investigates the variable roles of music during World War I primarily from the angle of the Entente nations‚Äô perceived threat of German hegemony. His most recent work, The Gesualdo Hex (2010) traces not only the recognition accorded to a Renaissance prince from his own time to the early twenty-first century but places it within the context of ongoing historiographic debates and controversies. Watkins has lectured widely in America for universities, orchestras and art organizations, and his interest in both late Renaissance and 20th-century studies is reflected in numerous invited papers for international conferences as well as in projects for Columbia, Nonesuch, Pye, √âditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre, Harmonia Mundi, Glossa, and Deutsche Grammophon records and for BBC, German, and Italian television.

Later the Presbyterian Church (Presbytery of Lanka) joined the federation, to educate the new clergy (ministers) and laity in the environment and context of Sri Lanka and their own languages, Sinhala and Tamil. Rev. Basil Jackson, a British Methodist Missionary, became the founding Principal of the college in 1963. (Prior to the foundation of TCL, Jackson served as the founding director of the Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue in Colombo). It is believed that language is the vehicle of culture and when Christians begin to think, speak, preach, pray and write in their own languages, they soon become familiar with their cultural values and begin to appreciate them in the practice of their Christian faith. This new step was foreseen by all the churches as an attempt to produce indigenous theology by people who are being educated in Sri Lanka. Before this venture, the ministers of Sri Lankan (then Ceylon) Protestant traditions have been educated mainly in India (United Theological College, Bishop's College, Serampore College, Kolkotta etc.) or elsewhere for the pastoral ministry. TCL is situated in Plimatalawa village, Kandy district, about 100 km away from Colombo. The Theological College of Lanka is affiliated to the Senate of Serampore College (University) of India and accredited by the Association of the Theological Education in South East Asia (ATESEA). Over 90% of the active clergy in the constituent churches in Sri Lanka today have received their theological and pastoral education at the TCL. The TCL is the only accredited ecumenical theological college among the Protestant churches of Sri Lanka, which not only maintains its ecumenical foundation, but also brings together the Sinhala and Tamil students who are both men and women in a fellowship both at work and at leisure. This is an integral aspect of the personal and spiritual formation of the future ministers of a country which is torn apart by ethnic divisions. Contributing to the theological-praxical debate, the college publishes a biannual journal ‚Äì Sri Lanka Journal of Theological Reflection (SLJTR) which was commenced in July 2005.  Towards Sri Lankan Identity  Main gate of Theological College of Lanka (TCL) After independence from Britain in 1948, the outward occurrences in Sri Lanka, especially the decreasing missionary influence and the independent parliamentary system, affected the Christian churches in many ways. Christians became aware of their self-identity and the selfhood of the church. There was a small group of Christians who had foreseen the need to think and act as in new ways after independence. Among them was the Reverend Lakdasa de Mel whose process of indigenisation launched at Baddhegama in the 1920s was an important step. His efforts eventually created what is now called the Ceylon Liturgy, using Sinhala folk music derived from sources such as the paddy farmers, cartmen and boatmen in rural areas of Sri Lanka. Pioneering activities such as this became valuable when the British left the Island in 1948. People who had become Christians through the work of missionaries were forced to rethink their identity in the emerging post- colonial context. Significant cultural and social changes did not begin to take place until the late 1950s, and especially after the 1956 general election. The coalition government headed by the newly formed Sri Lanka Freedom Party set out to establish a new cultural identity. The English language was displaced by the use of Sinhala and Tamil for all official business as well as in education. The Church equally accepted the importance of local languages but saw its own future looking very bleak when the government decided to take over management of the school network. In 1963 three of the Protestant churches in Sri Lanka, namely Anglican, Methodist and Baptist decided to form a theological college for the training of future ministers. After much discussion and consideration the founders of this college opted for the use of local languages and a localised cultural emphasis. Later, the Presbyterian Church in Sri Lanka joined with the other churches to formulate the training of their ministers. When the Theological College was founded in Lanka in 1963 it was almost unthinkable that theology should be taught in local languages, namely Sinhala and Tamil.  Sri Lankan Christian Theology  Nationalism became very prominent in Sri Lanka after independence. This situation forced Christians to inculturise Christianity. The task of inculturising Christianity became a difficult exercise, due to the Western culture and theology which prevailed among Christians. They found it difficult to accept and think along with their Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim friends. If there had been no English influence, this process would have commenced long before, but now it came too late and was too little. The inculturisation process was not able to baptize the Sri Lankan culture and make a significant impact upon societies influenced by Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam. Nevertheless, many attempts were made to inculturise Christianity in a Sri Lankan context. This process proceeded parallelly, in both Sinhala and Tamil cultures. The inculturisation process emphasised by many church leaders and emerging Asian Christian theologies influenced the churches in Sri Lanka very much. The churches in Sri Lanka felt that the Western influence in architecture, music and worship forms merely imitated the West. Therefore, people desired to experience the gospel in a truly Sri Lankan context, thereby expressing their faith and worship of God by using their own language, symbols, songs, dances and other social and cultural idioms. Doing Christian Theology in the Sri Lankan culture means, to be able to understand God in culture as expressed in life situations. God is a God of history and one should be able to understand God in the Sri Lankan history. Therefore, in order to produce an indigenous theology, it is essential to understand the meaning of Sinhala and Tamil cultures in Sri Lanka. Contributing to the theological and praxical debates, college publishes a journal:Sri Lanka Journal of Theological Reflection.  Nature and Structure of the Theological College of Lanka  Lectures at the Theological College are held in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Sinhala and Tamil students are required to write in their own languages. Tamil students study Practical Sinhala and Sinhala students study practical Tamil, giving all students a practical knowledge of each other's language. Apart from classroom work, field education is taken seriously as an integral part of the students' tuition. The field education programme is divided into three main areas ‚Äì weekend field education; long- vacation field placement and a research-and-an-extended essay on a subject chosen by the student. The chapel is decorated with Sri Lankan woodcarvings. The congregation remove their footwear and sit on the floor. Indigenous musical instruments such as tabla, violin and sitar mainly accompany worship. Guitars are used where appropriate, without displacing the indigenous atmosphere of worship. Sinhala students study Buddhism under a scholarly monk while Tamil students study Hinduism from an experienced tutor. The Theological College of Pilimatalawa has effectively shown that Sinhala and Tamil students can study together in the same classes in their own languages. It is important to note that the importance of English is as a link language and not as the language of the elite. When Sinhala lecturers teach in Sinhala and English, Tamil students depend on their knowledge of English and other students to understand what is being taught. Similarly, when Tamil lecturers each in Tamil and English, Tamil students depend on their knowledge of English and other students. Sinhala and Tamil lecturers always try to give a summary in another language to make students from other ethnic groups feel comfortable. Although this way of teaching is not easy it has brought Sinhala and Tamil students together without abandoning their mother tongue. Located in a predominately Buddhist village, the college has served Sri Lankan society for forty years, training Christian ministers who will work in the community with a sound understanding of Sri Lankan realities and make bridges between various socio- cultural and religious groups. The theologising process has helped the students to identify the needs, aspirations and anxieties of the people in a given area and to respond theologically, to know the involvement of the churches and their relationship with one another and with other faiths, in an attempt to discern the work of God through people of other faiths, ideologies and other organisations, to learn from the experiences of different individuals and organisations, already involved in the community and to be challenged for a creative and a fruitful contextual ministry in the areas, where they will be placed in the future.  Historical Survey of the Theological College of Lanka  A Consultation committee appointed by the Protestant churches in Sri Lanka to submit a report for discussion. The committee reported back on 17 September 1952 that it was time to re-study the problems and progress of Sri Lankan theological education. The first notice about ‚Äòa conversation of the Theological Training in Ceylon‚Äô was sent out by Rev. Basil Jackson on 1 June 1956. The first, one day consultation on theological training was held on 12 July 1956 at the Study Centre. Two speakers, Rev Cyril Abenayake from the Anglican Church and Rev Tom Garret from the Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary presented the issues and guided the church representatives to look at the theological education seriously in Sri Lanka for the churches in Sri Lanka. This consultation appointed a constitution committee Committee members: Ven C. H. W. de Soysa, Ven. James Amerasekara, Rev. C. L. Abenayake, Rev. R. C. cooling, Rev. S. J. De S. Weerasinghe, Rev. S. G. Mendis, and the Study Secretary of NCC Rev. R. W. Pile. to draft a possible cooperation document between participating churches. The consultation committee submitted their report to the participating churches on 17 September 1958. Another four member committee appointed by the churches, chaired by Rev. R. C. Cooling was presented to the participating churches in February 1957. This report appealed to the churches to collaborate among themselves, and suggested for the sake of presenting the gospel for the people of Ceylon in the language and idiom of the Swabasha speaking people of the country. This report and all the discussions on this topic took place previously made the Churches in Sri Lanka felt that the present Western influence in architecture, music and forms of worship merely imitates the West. Therefore, people should experience the Gospel in a truly Sri Lankan context, thereby expressing their faith and worship of God by using their own language, symbols, songs, dances and other social and cultural patterns.Weerasuriya, Ven. C. E. G. The Church of Ceylon History 1945‚Äì1995. Colombo, Sri Lanka; The Diocese of Colombo, 1995 In response to the need for an ‚Äòeducated clergy,‚Äô and the social status, theological educational institution in Sri Lanka became the need of the day. The first meeting of the Board of Governors of the Theological College of Lanka was held on 15 December 1961 at the Methodist Headquarters in Colombo to look at a suitable venue. The ‚ÄòFerence‚Äô, was identified.Board minutes: 15 December 1961 The second meeting held on 3 January 1962 decided to request the Methodist Church in Ceylon to release the property on lease.Board minutes: 19 January 1962 On 12 September 1962, it was decided to represent the Board of the Theological College of Lanka at the next Senate meeting of the Senate of Serampore College. On 28 November 1962 it was decided to nominate Canon de Mel to represent the college. On 9 February 1963, Cannon de Mel reported back, \\"Senate passed a resolution that the Principal of TCL should apply for affiliation.\\" 26 June 1964 BOG minutes say that a team from the Senate of Serampore College visited the college on 9 and 10 April 1964. On 25 June 1964, the college received a telegram informing \\"affiliation granted letter following.\\" From this point onwards several decisions were made based on suggestions and papers to make the theological education in Sri Lanka contextually routed to the country. The Ceylon Daily Mirror, 13 January 1962 reported that a ‚ÄòSwabasha Theological College‚Äô will be inaugurated in July 1963. The Ceylon Daily Mirror, 11 July 1963 reported about the inauguration of the Theological College of Lanka on 10 July 1964. The Serampore granted permission for the first batch of students enrolled in 1963 to register for the Licentiate in Theology (L.Th) certificate.BOG minutes: 26 June 1964 The L.Th programme continued until the Senate delegation visited the college from 3 and 4 March 1970 and upgraded the college to B.Th.Principal‚Äôs Log Book entry A working paper presented by the Rev. C. D. E. Premawardhana,Dated 19 August 1968 titled ‚ÄòThe Future Structure and Scope of the Theological College of Lanka\\" initiated a single integrated training for Sinhala and Tamil students at the college. This move was made with the hope that the Jaffna Diocese of the CSI would join the federation of the college. However, Dr D. T. Niles officially informed that the \\"Bishop of the CSI did not seem interested in the Tamil stream at the TCL.\\"BOG Minutes: 5 November 1968 Based on a paper presented by the Rev C. D. E. Premawardena dated 31 October 1968, the BOG decided to initiate three units at the college. 1) The Department of Lay Training 2) The Department of Christian education to train teachers of Christianity 3) The Institute of Buddhist Studies. Study of Theravada Buddhism in order to find meaningful Asian Theology. The Department of Lay Training launched a correspondence course, ‚ÄòThe Christian Faith‚Äô in January 1972 initiated by the Rev Georg E. Good.Principal‚Äôs Report 1972 The Year 1976 has been a mile stone in the life of the college. Mr. D. S. A. Hapuarchchige, the English-Sinhala translator of the college translated six English books in Sinhala in the fields of the Old Testament, New Testament and Christian education and were published.Principal‚Äôs Report 1976 The Department of Lay Training became the Lay Institute and function under the directorship of Rev Yohan Devananda. \\"How do we Live in the Gospel Today\\" has been the general theme of the Lay Institute.Principal‚Äôs Report 1987 It was felt that the whole of the Theological College of Lanka experience needs to be an intentional learning opportunity, not just the classroom hours. Students should be discouraged from being consumers, picking and choosing what they believe they will need and ignoring elements that are more demanding or less appealing. Looking back many former students have confessed that they wished they had taken more notice of this or that subject because they were unaware at the time of how valuable it would subsequently prove. This has made the college to seriously look at the library of the college and a permanent librarian Mrs Rose Sinnathamby was appointed on 1 December 1978.Principal‚Äôs Report 1979 The college joined the Association of the Theological Colleges in South East Asia (ATESEA) in 1978.Principal‚Äôs Report 1978 Serampore College commenced ‚ÄòDiploma in Christian Studies‚Äô and ‚ÄòBachelor of Christian Studies‚Äô programmes.Principal‚Äôs Report 1994 Church History Documentation Centre to preserve the historical stories of the churches in Sri Lanka, initiated by Dr Klaus Koschorke was launched in 1993 Principal‚Äôs Report 1993 and later moved to a spacious room at the newly built library at the college.TCL 40th Anniversary Principal‚Äôs Report in 2003 The first TCL journal ‚ÄòVoice of the Street‚Äô was launched in 2003. Sri Lanka Journal of Theological Reflection (SLJTR) was launched in 2005 as a biannual publication of the Theological College of Lanka (TCL). \\"The journal is to enfold the thoughts, ideas and theology kindled by the people living in, migrated from or closely connected with the island called Sri Lanka. It was an attempt to provide a forum to foster theological thinking in Sri Lanka. SLJTR is the story of a people‚Äôs dynamic corporative response to the challenge of the Gospel of Christ and of life in the environment of Sri Lanka. We have discovered that Sri Lankan theology and Church have a history of their own.\\"Editorial, SLJTR, 2005 The intentionality of the learning contract we have with students should relate to much more than the acquisition of academic knowledge of an individual. The whole learning process should go with the discipleship and character of the family as well. Spouses of the married students who are brilliant in vocational skills requested a systematic training programme during their stay as a family in the college. They wanted to be assets in future church leadership. As a response a two-year the Spouses Class Certificate programme launched in 2005.Principal‚Äôs Report 2005 Academic instruction needs to go along with skill development and personal growth. Any one dimension without the others is a distorted education that leads to malformed graduates ill- equipped to cope with the demands that will be placed on them. Theological education inevitably is trying to satisfy a number of different audiences ‚Äì the academy, the church, the world, the laity and the student him or herself. As a response to the tsunami disaster in December 2004, the college launched two programmes for the internal students and laity in 2006. 1) Diploma in Counselling and Group Work Skills (Dip CGWS) 2) Diploma in Special Education on Disability (Dip SED).Principal‚Äôs Report 2007 After the civil war ended in 2009, TCL launched a programme in 2010 the \\" making safe spaces to share our stories\\" programme for the purpose of national reconciliation and healing in the country and promoting multi-multiculturalism and interfaith and inter ethnic relationships. The Theological college of Lanka entered partnership with the Queen's Foundation, UK in 2011 In July 2013 The Theological College of Lanka celebrated her Golden Jubilee. Reverend Dr. Dietrich Werner was the Chief Guest and came as the official representative of the World Council of Churches at this solemn and significant moment.

He sometimes used the spelling of \\"Kazuhiko Katoh\\". History As a member of the Folk Crusaders, Kato launched his recording career in the mid-1960s. \\"Kaettekita Yopparai (I Only Live Twice)\\", their psychedelic debut song composed by Kato and released in 1967, sold more than 1.3 million copies in Japan, and became one of the best-selling singles of the early Japanese popular music industry.List of million-selling singles on the Japanese Oricon Weekly Chart (up to October 2009)--- \\"Kaettekita Yopparai\\"is listed as the 116th best-selling single in that country The group also starred in director Nagisa Oshima's 1968 film Kaette kita yopparai (alternately known as Sinner in Paradise or Three Resurrected Drunkards). After the breakup of Folk Crusaders in 1970, Kato gained success for his production works for other musicians, including Shigeru Izumiya, Mariya Takeuchi, and Takuro Yoshida. In particular, Sadistic Mika Band, the acclaimed project he started with his first wife Mika Fukui, received international success. Their 1974 album entitled Kurofune (The Black Ship) is regarded as one of the most significant Japanese rock albums of the mid-1970s. The group was disbanded and reassembled again several times, with new vocalists such as Yumi Matsutoya, Karen Kirishima, and Kaela Kimura. As a composer, Kato penned the theme song \\"Ai Oboete Imasu ka\\" for the anime film Macross: Do You Remember Love?, which was released during the summer of 1984 in Japan. He later formed a songwriting team with his second wife, the late Kazumi Yasui. Most of the songs they wrote were recorded and produced by Kenji Sawada. In 1990, Kato teamed up with graphic artists, Haruhiko Shono and Kuniyoshi Kaneko, to provide the music for the award-winning Japanese computer game, Alice. In March 2008, Kato formed the rock band Vitamin-Q with Masami Tsuchiya, Gota Yashiki, Rei Ohara and Anza. Death Kato committed suicide by hanging on October 17, 2009 at a hotel in Karuizawa, Kitasaku District, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Police discovered a suicide note in his hotel room.

In what must be the worst record of any Australian touring team, the squad lost all of their Canadian matches among five defeats.Howell, p. 68. Tasker was the first-ever Wallaby to be sent from the field. An incident occurred on the 1912 tour of the United States when Tasker's rough play upset an American referee.Zavos, p. 142. Tasker made his Test debut at Athletic Park (Wellington) on the 1913 tour of New Zealand and played in all three Tests of that tour. The following year he made three further Test appearances when the All Blacks toured Australia in a return series. War service Tasker enlisted in the AIF in January 1915, a Gunner in the 12th Field Artillery Brigade, 13th Battalion (Australia). He took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove, landing late on 25 April 1915. From May to August, the 13th battalion was heavily involved in establishing and defending the ANZAC front lines. Tasker was severely wounded at Quinn's Post at Gallipoli with shell fragment damage to his legs and ankle. He was invalided back to Australia. A rugby colleague also at Gallipoli, H.A Mitchell of the Manly Club wrote home of Tasker's injuries \\"A bomb loaded up Tasker's leg and ankle up with about 17 pieces of shot.

It is particularly associated with the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907) and its tomb figures,Vainker, 75 appearing around 700.Medley, 22 Therefore, it is commonly referred to as Tang Sancai in Chinese. Tang sancai wares were sometimes referred in China and the West as egg-and-spinach by dealers, for their use of green, yellow, and white, especially when combined with a streaked effect.A History of the Silk Road, Jonathan Clements; The Art of the Table: A Complete Guide to Table Setting, Table Manners,..., Suzanne Von Drachenfels, p. 37 It uses lead-glazed earthenware, and although two firings were needed,Vainker, 75 it was easier and therefore cheaper to make than Chinese porcelain or celadon, and suitable for making large figures, if necessary made up of several moulded sections assembled after a first firing. Vessels, mostly rather small and made for burial, were made in the technique as well as figures. Small plates with three feet, typically about 18-40 cm (7-16 inches) across, called \\"offering-trays\\", are a distinctive type, with more carefully controlled decoration than other types of pieces.Medley, 30 tomb guardian The white may come from the natural colour of the fired clay, sometimes coated with a transparent glaze, or there may be a white slip. The brown and green colours came from adding metal oxides to a lead glaze, and in fact blues and blacks are also found. The blue came from adding imported cobalt, and was therefore more expensive and used sparingly, often on smaller pieces.Vainker, 76 Technique Tang footed jar with relief decoration The body of sancai ceramics was made of white clay, coated with coloured glaze, and fired at a temperature of 800 degrees Celsius. Sancai is a type of lead-glazed earthenware: lead oxide was the principal flux in the glaze, often mixed with quartz in the proportion of 3:1. The polychrome effect was obtained by using as colouring agents copper (which turns green), iron (which turns brownish yellow), and less often manganese and cobalt (which turns blue).Shanghai Museum permanent exhibit. At kiln sites located at Tongchuan, Neiqui county in Hebei and Gongxian in Henan, the clays used for burial wares were similar to those used by Tang potters. The burial wares were fired at a lower temperature than contemporaneous whitewares. Large figures made for grave goods in burials (\\"burial wares), such as the well-known Tang dynasty tomb figures with people, camels and horses, were cast in sections, in moulds with the parts luted together using clay slip. In some cases, a degree of individuality was imparted to the assembled figurines by hand-carving. When used together, the glazes ran into each other at the edges, giving much of the character of the decoration. Apart from the precisely painted offering-trays, which mostly have moulded contours for the areas in different colours, in most pieces the colours are applied loosely, even carelessly. Splashing and spotting are often used, and on both vessels and figures the colours often do not attempt to follow relief areas or different parts of the bodies.Vainker, 76; Medley, 34-37 Decorative motifs, in painting or relief, are borrowed from textiles, jewellery and metalwork.Medley, 37-41 Development Foreign musicians on camel. Sancai glaze. 723 CE Sancai wares were made in north China using white and buff-firing secondary kaolins and fire clays.Wood, Nigel (1999). Chinese Glazes. A.C. Black, London. . Sancai follows the development of green-glazed pottery dating back to the Han period (25-220 AD); the brown glaze was also known to the Han, but they only very rarely mixed the two in a single piece.Medley, 16 After the Han the use of these glazes almost disappears for some four hundred years, which has rather puzzled experts. The great majority of survivals are from burial goods, which in the intervening period are painted with pigments that are not fired (and so have now mostly fallen off the piece). But a trickle of pieces shows a \\"tenuous lead-glazing tradition linking Han to Sui and T'ang\\".Medley, 16-18, 17 quoted Predecessors to the sancai style can also be seen in some Northern Qi (550-577) ceramic works. Northern Qi tombs have revealed some beautiful artifacts, such as porcellaneous ware with splashed green designs, previously thought to have been developed under the Tang dynasty.The arts of China by Michael Sullivan p.19ffChinese glazes: their origins, chemistry, and recreation by Nigel Wood p.200 The full polychrome sancai combination appears shortly before the end of the 7th century. After only about 70 years, the production of tomb figures seems to have ceased almost completely with the very disruptive An Lushan Rebellion of 755, followed by a Tibetan invasion of the north in 763, but the vessels continued for another fifty years or more.Medley, 24-26 Sancai rhyton with duck's head. After another long gap, sancai was again produced from the late Tang and in the Liao dynasty (907‚Äì1125, a breakaway foreign dynasty in the far north).Medley, 26 It was often used for large items made for temples. Sets of sancai luohan figures up to life-size were often displayed in special luohan halls in temples. Few of these that remained in place survived the Cultural Revolution. The Yixian glazed pottery luohans are a Liao dynasty set that is now distributed between various Western museums, and so very well known. Unusually, these were constructed around internal supporting iron bars. Pairs of large guardian figures flanking shrines were also made. Vessels The tomb figures are covered by their own article. The other type of sancai pieces was vessels in a number of shapes, but none very large, all found almost exclusively in burials, and perhaps only ever made for them. The shapes are mostly characterized by \\"contrasting contours and almost extravagant roundness, expanding to the point almost of bursting\\".Medley, 26 Many adapt non-Chinese shapes, mostly from metalwork, although some can be traced back to ancient Greek pottery, and may be described by the Greek terms amphora (two- handled vase) and oinochoe (jug or ewer with spout and a handle), the last usually having a spout in the form of the head of a bird or fenghuang (Chinese phoenix). These derive from \\"Hellenistic survivals in the oasis states and the cities of western Central Asia\\". The handles of amphorae often rejoin the body in a dragon's head biting the rim. Other shapes are traditionally Chinese, such as the lidded jar.Medley, 26-34, 31 quoted It is possible, as has also been suggested for much ancient Greek pottery, that the ceramic vessels were cheaper copies for burial of the vessels in metal, probably silver, that the deceased used or aspired to in life,Vainker, 78 just as the tomb figures replicated servants and animals. Many pieces have relief decoration, either applied by sprigging, or in the moulds used to make many pieces, though simple shapes were still made on the potter's wheel.Medley, 28-30 File:Green glazed pottery dog Eastern Han 25CE 220CE.jpg|Before sancai: Green-glazed pottery dog, Eastern Han, 25-220 AD.

At one point there were more than 3,000 factories, mostly tiny and shabby, sprinkled around Luoyang City, cradle of the craft. They churned out shoddy Tang-style sancai pieces in vast numbers, until they began to undercut each other in a chaotic price war. With a glut in the market, many of their products ended up being hawked by street vendors. The reproduction business has benefited from the development of new techniques. Some in the field can produce works that may fool even the most experienced eyes. Emboldened by the precision of forgery technology and lured by exorbitant profit, some sell pastiches as originals.

The M84A1 gun is replaced with a similar but improved gun which, along with better control characteristics, enables easy and fast field replacement of the barrel. The M-84AS tank is able to fire anti-tank guided missiles with laser guidance through the barrel, which enables accurate engagement of enemy tanks up to 5 km. The M-84AS is equipped with non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour (NERA) which offers protection against modern tandem charge warheads on missiles. It is also equipped with the modern Shtora electro-optical system for defense against wire and laser guided anti-tank missiles. The new turret will provide protection against Kinetic Energy (RHAe) anti-tank guided missiles.

Terrazas, 444 U.S. 252 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court decision that established that a United States citizen cannot have his or her citizenship taken away unless he or she has acted with an intent to give up that citizenship. The Supreme Court overturned portions of an act of Congress which had listed various actions and had said that the performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive, irrebuttable proof of intent to give up U.S. citizenship. However, the Court ruled that a person's intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of preponderance of evidence (i.e., more likely than not) ‚Äî rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on the basis of clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence.  Background  Laurence Terrazas was born in the United States in 1947. Note the different order of the names in this lower court case. Because Terrazas's father was Mexican and because Mexico's citizenship laws then followed the principle of ius sanguinis, Terrazas held Mexican citizenship at birth and because he was born in the United States, Terrazas also held US citizenship under the ius soli of the Fourteenth Amendment; therefore, Terrazas was a dual citizen of the United States and Mexico at birth. While enrolled at a Mexican university in 1970, Terrazas applied for a certificate of Mexican nationality. As part of his application, Terrazas signed a statement renouncing \\"United States citizenship, as well as any submission, obedience and loyalty to any foreign government, especially to that of the United States of America.\\" During subsequent discussions with a US consular official, Terrazas gave conflicting answers as to whether or not he had truly intended to abandon his rights as a US citizen when he applied for his certificate of Mexican nationality. The State Department eventually concluded that he had lost his US citizenship, a decision which Terrazas appealed, first before the State Department's board of appellate review, and subsequently to the courts. Before the 1967 Supreme Court ruling in Afroyim v. Rusk, US law had provided for numerous ways for citizens to lose their citizenship. In its Afroyim ruling, the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment barred Congress from revoking anyone's citizenship without their consent. Specifically, the court held that a law automatically revoking the citizenship of anyone who had voted in a foreign election was unconstitutional and unenforceable. However, US law continued, after Afroyim to list several other \\"expatriating acts,\\" the voluntary performance of any of which would result in automatic loss of citizenship.Immigration and Nationality Act, sec. 349; 8 U.S.C. sec. 1481. The phrase \\"voluntarily performing any of the following acts with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality\\" was added in 1986, and various other changes have been made over time to the list of expatriating acts; see notes. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that according to Afroyim v. Rusk, \\"Congress is constitutionally devoid of the power\\" to revoke citizenship; and that Congress had no power to legislate any evidentiary standard for proving Terrazas's intent to relinquish his citizenship that fell short of a requirement of proof by clear, convincing and unequivocal evidence. The Secretary of State appealedStern, Gressman, and Shapiro, \\"Epitaph for Mandatory Jurisdiction.\\" ABA Journal, December 1988, p. 66. \\"In 1937, during a time of constitutional challenges to many federal statutes, Congress also provided for direct appeals to the Supreme Court from decisions of any federal court‚Äîtrial or appellate‚Äîholding a federal statute unconstitutional.... On June 27 [1988], President Reagan signed legislation that freed the Court from virtually all appeals....\\" this ruling to the Supreme Court, questioning not only the appellate court's finding on the required standard of proof, but also challenging the finding that a separate intent to give up citizenship was required (as opposed merely to the performance of a designated expatriating act).  Opinion  A 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court held that it was not enough for the government to prove \\"the voluntary commission of an act, such as swearing allegiance to a foreign nation, that 'is so inherently inconsistent with the continued retention of American citizenship that Congress may accord to it its natural consequences, i. e., loss of nationality.'\\" Rather, the court held that its 1967 ruling in Afroyim v. Rusk \\"emphasized that loss of citizenship requires the individual's 'assent,' ... in addition to his voluntary commission of the expatriating act\\" and that \\"the trier of fact must in the end conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship.\\" On that point, the Supreme Court agreed with the 7th Circuit ruling in Terrazas's favor. The majority then turned its attention to the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of clear and convincing evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved. Finally, the Supreme Court majority upheld the validity of another aspect of the law as enacted by Congress: that the government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress was up to the person involved to establish by preponderance of evidence. The Supreme Court did not explicitly rule on whether or not Terrazas had lost his US citizenship; rather, it remanded the case back to the original trial court (a Federal District Court in Illinois) for further proceedings consistent with the court's ruling. Although the court's membership was divided on the question of whether a \\"preponderance of evidence\\" standard was sufficient for establishing someone's intent to give up their U.S. citizenship, all nine judges agreed with the key holding in Afroyim v. Rusk that US citizenship was safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment and could not be taken away by an act of Congress from a person without consent.  Dissents  The four justices who disagreed with the majority filed three separate dissenting opinions. All of the dissenting justices supported the Afroyim v. Rusk principle that retention of US citizenship was a constitutionally protected right, and they all agreed (contrary to the court's majority) that Terrazas's actions should not have led to the loss of his citizenship. Justice Thurgood Marshall rejected the majority's decision that an intent to give up citizenship could be established merely by a preponderance of evidence. Arguing that \\"the Court's casual dismissal of the importance of American citizenship cannot withstand scrutiny,\\" he said that he \\"would hold that a citizen may not lose his citizenship in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that he intended to do so.\\" Justice John Paul Stevens also argued that \\"a person's interest in retaining his American citizenship is surely an aspect of 'liberty' of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law\\" and that \\"due process requires that a clear and convincing standard of proof be met\\" in Terrazas's case or others like it. Additionally, Stevens felt that Congress had not adequately addressed the question of specific intent to relinquish citizenship. \\"Since we accept dual citizenship,\\" he wrote, \\"taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an American citizen. Moreover, as now written, the statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship.\\" Justices William J. Brennan, Jr., and Potter Stewart argued that since Terrazas was born a dual US/Mexican national, his having taken an oath of allegiance to Mexico was consistent with his being a citizen of the U.S. In Brennan's words: \\"The formal oath [of allegiance to Mexico] adds nothing to the existing foreign citizenship and, therefore, cannot affect his United States citizenship.\\" Brennan argued, in addition, that since \\"Congress has provided for a procedure by which one may formally renounce citizenship\\" before US consular officials, a procedure that all conceded that Terrazas used, Terrazas was still a US citizen.  Subsequent developments  After receiving Terrazas's case from the Supreme Court on remand, the district court again ruled that Terrazas had lost his citizenship. On subsequent appeal, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed its earlier decision and, this time using a preponderance-of-evidence standard per the instructions of the Supreme Court, ruled against him, finding this time that there was \\"abundant evidence that plaintiff intended to renounce his United States citizenship when he acquired the Certificate of Mexican Nationality willingly, knowingly, and voluntarily.\\" Since the office of U.S. Secretary of State changed hands twice following the Supreme Court's ruling in the case, Edmund Muskie replacing Cyrus Vance in 1980, and Alexander Haig assuming the position in 1981, the subsequent lower court cases are known as Terrazas v. Muskie and Terrazas v. Haig. Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1986 to specify, as required by Vance v. Terrazas, that a potentially expatriating act may result in loss of citizenship only if it was performed \\"with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality.\\"Public Law 99-653; 100 Stat. 3655; 1986 U.S. Code Congressional and Administrative News 6182. Although the Terrazas ruling left intact Congress's right to specify a preponderance-of-evidence standard for judging intent to give up citizenship, the State Department in 1990 adopted a policy that pursues loss-of-citizenship proceedings issues usually only when an individual affirmatively states the intent to relinquish citizenship.67 Interpreter Releases 799 (July 23, 1990); 67 Interpreter Releases 1092 (October 1, 1990). When a case involving possible expatriation comes to the attention of a US consular officer, the officer will normally \\"simply ask the applicant if there was intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship when performing the act. If the answer is no, the consular officer will certify that it was not the person's intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship and, consequently, find that the person has retained U.S. citizenship.\\"Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Citizenship and Dual Nationality (U.S. State Department web site). A bill was introduced in 2005, which sought, among other things, to force the State Department to abolish the above policy on loss of citizenship and reinstate its pre-1990 policy \\"of viewing dual/multiple citizenship as problematic and as something to be discouraged, not encouraged.\\"H.R. 3938 (109th Congress), sec. 703.

The vessel was libeled and sold by the British Admiralty Court in Nassau, Bahamas then seized and sold again within weeks. A crew of mixed nationality, described as \\"motley\\" and \\"buccaneers\\" was recruited in Havana where 8,000 cases of grain alcohol valued at $500,000 and Cuban tobacco was placed aboard, ostensibly destined for St. Pierre with actual destination being \\"Rum Row\\" with sales along the coast on the way. The vessel was at times termed \\"The Queen of Rum Row\\" but fell on very hard times and being swindled of much of her cargo. Eventually, out of fuel and money, steam was raised by chopping up interior woodwork and on 23 May 1923 the master surrendered to customs agents at the quarantine anchorage in New York.

The family was met with intense hostility by local residents. The Kenwood Improvement Association filed a mandatory injunction for the Hansberry family to vacate their home which was granted by a Circuit Court judge and upheld on appeal by the Illinois Supreme Court. Hansberry challenged the ruling, which led to the landmark U. S. Supreme Court case Hansberry v. Lee (1940). In a unanimous opinion rendered November 12, 1940, the court rejected the specific restrictive covenant impacting the Hansberry family without ruling on the constitutionality of restrictive residential covenants in general. In 1940, Hansberry made an unsuccessful bid for Congress. In the wake of that loss and frustrated by the pervasive racism in the United States, he made plans to move his family to Mexico. While visiting Mexico, Hansberry suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and died there on March 17, 1946. He is buried at the Burr Oak Cemetery in Cook County, Illinois. The family's experience with racial segregation would serve as the inspiration for his daughter Lorraine Hansberry's award-winning play, A Raisin in the Sun.

He and his younger brother, Carl Augustus Hansberry, were raised by their stepfather, Elijah Washington.1910 U.S. Census, Amite County, Mississippi, household of Elijah Washington In 1915, he attended Atlanta University, where he was exposed to a new volume of essays on race (published by the university's Sociology Department), which served as a major influence on him. Another big influence was the book, \\"The Negro\\" by W. E. B. Du Bois. After he purchased a copy of the book, he rushed to the school's library to refer to the references cited in the volume. To his dismay, Hansberry discovered Atlanta University's reference library to be sorely lacking. As a result, he left Atlanta University two weeks into his sophomore year to transfer to the best-equipped university he could find that would admit blacks. As a result, he began studies at Harvard University in February 1917; he completed his undergraduate studies there in 1921.William Leo Hansberry: Pioneer Africanist Scholar (1894-1965) by Runoko Rashidi Upon his graduation from Harvard, Hansberry taught for a year at Straight College (now Dillard University) in New Orleans. In September 1922, Hansberry joined the faculty of Howard University where he started the African Civilization Section of the History Department. Hansberry received his Masters from Harvard in 1932. Additional post-graduate work was done at the University of Chicago, Oxford University and Cairo University.Mississippi Writer's Page His knowledge of African studies was so vast that he was unable to obtain a Ph.D. because there was no school with faculty members qualified to supervise his dissertation. As a professor at Howard, Hansberry taught courses on African civilizations and cultures. By the mid-1930s, he was internationally recognized by his peers as an outstanding scholar in his field. Among his students were two future African leaders. One was the future Ghanaian revolutionary, Kwame Nkrumah. Nkrumah would later become the first prime minister and president of Ghana. The other was Nnamdi Azikiwe, who studied anthropology under him from 1928 to 1929 and wrote a eulogy for him. Azikiwe would become the first president of Nigeria. In 1961, then-Nigerian Governor-General Azikiwe thought Hansberry's work so important that he offered to underwrite the publication of his major work, The Rise and Decline of the Ethiopian Empire. Although Hansberry's courses were very popular with students, two distinguished faculty members accused Hansberry of teaching subject matter without adequate research to support it. With the program and his job on the line, Hansberry presented the Board of Trustees with detailed documentation of his research. While he managed to save the African studies program, Hansberry's research funding was cut off and he would not receive tenure until 1938. Despite the extensive research he conducted over his lifetime, Hansberry was very reluctant to have his work published. James Williams, one of his former students and later a Senior Professor of African History at Howard, recalled in 1972 that when his students urged publication of his work, Hansberry would smile, but always firmly reply, \\"I am not ready yet.\\"William Leo Hansberry, Teacher: As Seen by a Former Student by Chancellor James Williams, originally published in A Tribute to the Memory of Professor William Leo Hansberry, 1972, pp. 17-18 Hansberry retired from Howard in June 1959.

It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God.St. Teresa of Avila (2007) p. 241. And no prayer is purely vocal, as it has traditionally been defined: \\"Prayer is the raising of one's mind and heart to God.\\"CCC, 2559. One of the foremost writers on mental prayer, Teresa of Avila, stated: \\"Contemplative prayer [oraci√≥n mental] is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with him who we know loves us.\\"CCC, 4131. Here the emphasis is on love rather than on thought. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, meditation and contemplation which take place in mental prayer are \\"major expressions of the life of prayer\\" in the Christian tradition. The practice of mental prayer is necessary for reaching the goal of Christian perfection, said Mother Teresa. \\"Holiness is impossible without it.\\" Ignatius of Loyola, the Church's patron of retreats, popularized meditation and contemplation through his thirty-day retreat or Spiritual Exercises, which he customarily administered to laypersons. Nature and history 200px Mental prayer was defined by John Hardon as a \\"form of prayer in which the sentiments expressed are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is accomplished by internal acts of the mind and affections and is either simple meditation or contemplation.\\" Prayer is mental when the thoughts and affections of the soul are not expressed in a previously determined formula. The function of mental prayer is to transform the mind and thereby effect a change in dispositions and in the heart. Such transformation is a lifelong process.Leen, Edward, Progress Through Mental Prayer Adolphe Tanquerey distinguishes between vocal prayer, which is expressed by words or gestures, and mental prayer \\"which takes place wholly within the soul.\\" Mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God.St Teresa of Avila (2007) p. 141 Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, more active in reflections, and contemplation, more quiet and gazeful.Lehodey (1912) p. 5 John Cassian (5th century) and John Climacus (6th century) discussed the ways of mental prayer, and many Fathers of the Church gave their own recommendations for it: Augustine of Hippo, John Chrysostom, Jerome, Basil, Boethius, and Bernard of Clairvaux. From before the middle of the twelfth century, the Carthusians had times set apart for mental prayer. Early in the sixteenth century, the Dominican chapter of Milan prescribed mental prayer for half an hour during the morning and the evening. Among the Franciscans, there is mention of methodical mental prayer about the middle of that century. Among the Carmelites, there was no regulation for mental prayer until Teresa of Avila introduced it, practicing it for two hours daily. In the mid-sixteenth century Ignatius of Loyola in his Spiritual Exercises, which he used with laypersons, taught methods of both meditating on one's life and of contemplating the Gospel accounts of Jesus' life, as a means of becoming more like Christ. His method and that of Sulpice have helped spread the habit of meditating beyond the cloister. Some modern authors recommend that this prayer be called \\"interior prayer\\". Jacques Philippe said: Meditation Meditation consists of two operations ‚Äì one belongs to the thinking faculty which applies the imagination, memory, and understanding to consider some truth, principle, fact or mystery; the other is dependent on the will with a view to exciting proper spiritual emotions, to ask for the good proposed by the mind, and resolve on some act or course of action regarded as God's will and as a means of union with God. To some degree, this has always been practiced by God-fearing persons. According to Teresa of √Åvila, the person in this activity is like a gardener, who, with much labour, draws the water up from the depths of the well to water the plants and flowers.Lehodey (1912) p. 13 Importance Mother Teresa said: > We must never forget that we are bound to perfection and should aim > ceaselessly for it. The practice of mental prayer is necessary to reach that > goal. Because it is the breath of life for our soul, holiness is impossible > without it. It is only in mental prayer and spiritual reading that we > cultivate the gift of prayer. Mental prayer is greatly fostered by > simplicity ‚Äì that is forgetfulness of self and of the body and of the sense, > and by frequent aspirations that feed our prayer. Mother Teresa \\"He who neglects mental prayer,\\" affirms Teresa of Avila, \\"needs no devil to carry him to hell. He brings himself there with his own hands.\\" Her fellow Carmelite John of the Cross also said, \\"Without the aid of mental prayer, the soul cannot triumph over the forces of the demon.\\" Alphonsus Liguori, the Catholic Church's Doctor of moral theology, in his work Necessity and Power of Prayer, The Great Means of Salvation and Perfection, explained: \\"Mental prayer is the blessed furnace in which souls are inflamed with the love of God. All the saints have become saints by mental prayer.\\" And, recommending its importance, he said: \\"It is morally impossible for him who neglects meditation to live without sin.\\" He added that, because of its incompatibility with sin, nobody can continue the practice of mental prayer in the state of mortal sin. They will either repent or quit the practice of mental prayer. He saw it as a means of making available the graces needed for a persevering faith. Benedict XVI, speaking to priests, said of prayer and meditation: \\"Spending time in God's presence in prayer is a real pastoral priority; it is not an addition to pastoral work: being before the Lord is a pastoral priority and in the final analysis, the most important.\\" In the Foreword of his book Jesus of Nazareth, Benedict XVI emphasized that \\"everything depends\\" on \\"intimate friendship with Jesus.\\"Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth. Pope Francis said: \\"The spiritual life is fed, nourished, by prayer and is expressed outwardly through mission: inhaling and exhaling. When we inhale, by prayer, we receive the fresh air of the Holy Spirit. When exhaling this air, we announce Jesus Christ risen by the same Spirit.\\" Learning mental prayer John Paul II, in his program for the new millennium, said in his message for the 42nd \\"World Day of Prayer\\": \\"We have to learn to pray as if we were learning this art ever anew from the lips of the Divine Master himself, like the first disciples: 'Lord, teach us to pray!' (Lk 11:1).\\" Since sanctity is for everyone, according to Catholic doctrine, anyone can learn mental prayer. Therese of the Lisieux learned mental prayer when she was eleven years old. \\"Mental prayer is not just for priests and nuns, but is for everyone. The youngest of children are capable of reaching great heights through mental prayer,\\" is the teaching of the Franciscan Friar Minors. Pope Francis said: \\"The Lord speaks to us through the Scriptures and in our prayer. Let us learn to keep silence before him, as we meditate upon the Gospel.\\" Principles of mental prayer ;Relationship with a person Prayer means dealing with someone, a person, the living God. All prayer, even prayer of petition, is described by the Catechism of the Catholic Church as an openness, a response to God's Spirit speaking within us.CCC, 2561, 2564. \\"The Holy Spirit ... keeps the memory of Christ alive in his Church at prayer. ...It is the Face of the Lord that we seek and desire; it is his Word that we want to hear and keep.\\"CCC, 2625, 2656. The Catechism quotes Guigo the Carthusian: \\"Seek in reading and you will find in meditating; knock in mental prayer and it will be opened to you by contemplation.\\"CCC, 2654. As John Paul II said, \\"We shall not be saved by a formula but by a Person and the assurance which he gives us: I am with you!\\" And Benedict XVI said: \\"Being Christian is ... the encounter with an event, a person.\\" There is an I, a someone who wants to be with us, someone who listens, feels, sees, talks, and interacts with the one praying. \\"Friendly dealing\\" (tratar de amistad) is the literal translation of Teresa's definition of mental prayer: \\"Tratar de amistad, estando muchas veces tratando a solas con Quien sabemos nos ama.\\" The literal translation is: \\"Friendly dealing, many times dealing one-on-one with Him whom we know loves us. And this person has a face which we can contemplate, a face that is a singular manifestation of his person.\\" ;The principle of divine action The first important principle is: \\"What matters in prayer is not what we do but what God does in us during those moments,\\" said Jacques Philippe in Time for God. \\"The essential act in prayer is, at bottom, to place one's self in God's presence and to remain there. ...This presence, which is that of the living God, is active, vivifying. It heals and sanctifies us. We cannot sit before a fire without getting warm.\\" Allowing God to be fully present is key to the highest levels of prayer, according to John Paul II. \\"In prayer, the true protagonist is God,\\" he said in Crossing the Threshold of Hope. \\"Man achieves the fullness of prayer not when he expresses himself, but when he lets God be most fully present in prayer.\\" The biblical reason for this, according to John Paul II, is: \\"We do not know how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings\\" (cf. Rom 8:26). As Mother Teresa said, \\"In vocal prayer we speak to God, in mental prayer he speaks to us. It is then that God pours himself into us.\\" \\"Placing oneself in God's presence and remaining there\\" is the essential act of prayer, according to Philippe. St. Ignatius of Loyola has as a basic principle of his Spiritual Exercises that \\"the Lord communicates himself to the well-disposed person.\\"Spiritual Exercises, 15. ;Basic decision is making time for mental prayer The basic decision then is to \\"make time for the Lord, with the firm determination not to give up.\\"CCC, 2710. The recommended length of time per day varies from \\"a few minutes\\" (FriarsMinor.org), \\"30 minutes\\" (Eugene Boylan), \\"several minutes\\" (Josemaria Escriva), \\"one hour\\" (Francis of Sales), \\"minimum of half an hour in front of the Blessed Sacrament\\" (Alphonsus Liguori). The beginningcatholic.com recommends starting with 5‚Äì10 minutes. ;Primacy of love The second fundamental principle, according to Jacques Philippe is \\"love is above everything else.\\" The Catechism draws on Ephesians 3:16f in saying: \\"The Father strengthens our inner being with power through his Spirit 'that Christ may dwell in (our) hearts through faith' and we may be 'grounded in love.'\\"CCC, 2714 As Teresa explained, in prayer it does not matter as much to think as to love. This is in accordance with the commandment that Jesus aptly called \\"the greatest\\": Love God with your whole heart, your whole soul, your whole mind and your whole strength. \\"Loving in the first place is allowing oneself to be loved,\\" said Philippe. Benedict XVI stressed in Deus caritas est: \\"Anyone who wishes to give love must also receive love as a gift. ...One can become a source from which rivers of living water flow. Yet to become such a source, one must constantly drink anew from the original source, which is Jesus Christ, from whose pierced heart flows the love of God\\" (italics added). Benedict XVI emphasized that this is \\"the heart of the Gospel, the central nucleus of Christianity\\": \\"In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us\\" (1 Jn 4:10; italics added). We have come to believe in God's love is, Benedict says, the fundamental decision of a Christian's life. Joseph Ratzinger emphasized that sanctity is \\"nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend, allowing God to work, the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy.\\" \\"Fundamentally, prayer is to place oneself in God's presence and to allow him to love us,\\" says Philippe. And with this, the basic attitude of a Christian is humility coming from a knowledge of his own powerlessness and sinfulness in comparison to the grandeur of God. Thus Jesus criticized the self-praise of the Pharisees which showed them as people who \\"trusted themselves that they were righteous,\\" while he praised the tax-collector's petition for mercy, because \\"he who humbles himself will be exalted.\\" The Christian's love increases as a response to the love of God. \\"Contemplative prayer,\\" according to the Catechism, \\"is the prayer of the child of God, of the forgiven sinner who agrees to welcome the love by which he is loved and who wants to respond to it by loving even more.\\"CCC, 2712 Teresa of Avila said that my daily prayers should revolve around \\"giving myself totally to the Lord.\\" Practice of mental prayer ;Aids to prayer Francis of Sales said: \\"Begin all prayer, whether mental or vocal, by an act of the Presence of God. If you observe this rule strictly, you will soon see how useful it is.\\" He says that God is everywhere and is in our hearts and souls. Thus, \\"a blind man when in the presence of his prince will preserve a reverential attitude if told that the king is there, although unable to see him.\\"Francis of Sales, Practice of Mental Prayer Mother Teresa said that \\"I always begin my prayer in silence, for it is in the silence of the heart that God speaks.\\" Her \\"simple path\\" states: \\"The fruit of silence is PRAYER. The fruit of prayer is FAITH. The fruit of faith is LOVE. The fruit of love is SERVICE. The fruit of service is PEACE.\\" Ignatius of Loyola began each of his Spiritual Exercises with a \\"Preparatory Prayer\\" to place oneself in the presence of God, and closed each with a \\"Colloquy.\\" Examples of elaborated forms have since arisen: :Preparatory Prayer: My Lord and my God, I firmly believe that you are here, that you see me, that you hear me. I adore you with profound reverence, I ask your pardon for my sins, and the grace to make this time of prayer fruitful. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me.Charles Belmonte, Handbook of Prayers :Closing prayer: I thank you, my God, for the good resolutions, affections and inspirations that you have communicated to me in this meditation. I ask your help to put them into effect. My immaculate Mother, Saint Joseph my father and lord, my guardian angel, intercede for me. ;Topics for mental prayer *Calling God by name. As prayer means dealing with God as a person, it is important to address God with familiar names. **Jesus, the model of Christian prayer, used the word \\"Abba\\", an endearing Hebrew word to call God the Father. \\"A fundamental word in the mouth of 'the Son' is 'Abba'\\", said Benedict XVI. \\"It expresses his whole being, and all that he says to God in prayer is ultimately only an explication of his being (and hence an explication of this one word).\\" The Catechism quotes Augustine: \\"Our Father: at this name love is aroused in us ... and the confidence of obtaining what we are about to ask. ...What would he not give to his children who ask, since he has already granted them the gift of being his children?\\"CCC, 2785. **\\"The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All liturgical prayers conclude with the words \\"through our Lord Jesus Christ.\\" The Hail Mary reaches its high point in the words \\"blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\\" The Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, says: \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.\\" Many Christians, such as St. Joan of Arc, have died with the one word \\"Jesus\\" on their lips.\\"CCC, 435 *Focus on God. Benedict XVI said in Jesus of Nazareth: \\"Prayer is not about this or that; it's about God's desire to give us the gift of himself, the gift of gifts ‚Äì the one thing necessary. ...The gift of God is God himself.\\" The Catechism thus questioned focusing on other things: \\"How could the prayer of the children of adoption be centered on the gifts rather than the Giver?\\"CCC, 2740. **The Catechism said further: \\"We are usually helped by books, and Christians do not want for them: the Sacred Scriptures, particularly the Gospels, holy icons, liturgical texts of the day or season, writings of the spiritual fathers, works of spirituality, the great book of creation, and that of history the page on which the \\"today\\" of God is written.\\"CCC, 2707. **Meditating on the life of Jesus Christ. In Jesus of Nazareth, Benedict XVI kept on repeating Jesus' point: \\"He who sees me sees the Father. ...The figure of Jesus is the mirror in which we come to know who God is and what he is like.\\" **That God is love. Francis of Sales said: \\"I commend earnest mental prayer to you, more particularly such as bears upon the Life and Passion of our Lord. If you contemplate Him frequently in meditation, your whole soul will be filled with Him, you will grow in His Likeness, and your actions will be molded on His.\\"Alphonsus Ligouri, Necessity and Power of Prayer, The Great Means of Salvation and Perfection **The bulk of the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, the second and third \\"weeks\\", consists of contemplations on the life of Christ, and the fourth and final week is on seeing God in all things.Spiritual Exercises, 234-237.

The Valle del Cauca Deputies hostage crisis () refers to the kidnapping of 12 Deputies of the Valle del Cauca Department, Colombia, on April 12, 2002 by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to pressure a prisoner exchange between them and the government and to negotiate the demilitarization of the municipalities of Florida and Pradera to initiate peace dialogues.\\"Ex diputados piden acuerdo humanitario\\" El Pa√≠s Accessed 1 September 2007 After a series of \\"proof of life\\" videos, on June 28, 2007 the FARC suddenly reported the death of 11 of the 12 kidnapped provincial deputies from Valle del Cauca Department. The Colombian government accused the FARC of executing the hostages and stated that government forces had not made any rescue attempts. FARC claimed that the deaths occurred during a crossfire, after an attack to one of its camps by an \\"unidentified military group\\". FARC did not report any other casualties on either side.BBC: Colombia rebels 'killed hostages' news.bbc.co.uk Accessed 23 August 2007. When Sigifredo Lopez, the only surviving deputy, was released on February 5, 2009, he confirmed that his colleagues were killed when the FARC mistook approaching colleagues for Colombian Army troops. He managed to survive because he was separated from his colleagues at the time as punishment for arguing with a guard. FARC stated that their organization was willing to return the bodies to their families. The International Committee of the Red Cross was allowed to intervene by the guerrillas and the Colombian government. The efforts of the Red Cross recovery team were delayed due to difficult weather and terrain conditions upon arriving to the pick up area on September 5, 2007. The Colombian newspaper El Espectador speculated that the FARC also intended to give up the body of an alleged mercenary of the \\"unidentified military group\\" to prove their claims about an attack by such forces.

Kidnapping operation The FARC trained its guerrillas to act and dress as the military of Colombia to mislead civilians, politicians and members of the police. On April 11, 2002, the FARC mobilized its guerrillas to the Valle del Cauca Department Assembly in Cali riding in a bus and a truck. At 10:45 AM the guerrilla commando stormed the building dressed up as members of the Armed Forces of Colombia and alerting people in the building that there was a bomb threat. The FARC ordered the 12 deputies out of the building and board the bus, while other guerrillas stabbed with knives members of the Colombian National Police who noted the false operation. One of the policemen died as a consequence of the stabbing. While on the road the 12 deputies were then informed that they had been kidnapped by the FARC to serve as aces in a possible prisoner exchange with the government. Hostages Timeline 2002 ;April 11: The elite unit of the FARC \\"Mobile Column Arturo Ruiz\\" kidnapped 12 deputies in Cali from the Building of the Valle del Cauca Department Assembly. ;August 28: The FARC released the first evidence that the hostages were still alive. ;November 15: After three months in office, President √Ålvaro Uribe proposed freeing and sending captured guerrillas overseas if they released all hostages. ;December 3: FARC asked the government to demilitarize 115,000 km¬≤ in the Departments of Putumayo and Caqueta to negotiate an exchange of prisoners. ;December 27: FARC showed second survival video proof. 2003 ;April 28: FARC designated commanders Fabi√°n Ram√≠rez, Carlos Antonio Lozada and Felipe Rinc√≥n as negotiators for a prisoner exchange. 2004 ;January 24: FARC released a third video of the hostages. ;July 23: Uribe offered to free 50 guerrilla combatants so that FARC would free the hostages. The initiative is supported by the French and Swiss governments. ;September 14: FARC changed its proposal suggesting this time to demilitarize the municipalities of Cartagena del Chair√° and San Vicente del Cagu√°n, in Caquet√° Department. ;October 25: FARC released a fourth video of the hostages, most of it with messages for family members. 2005 ;December 13: The governments of France, Spain and Switzerland proposed both FARC and government of Colombia the demilitarization of 180 km¬≤ in the corregimiento of El Retiro, municipality of Florida to negotiate the prisoner exchange ;December 15: Uribe accepted the offer made by Spain, France and Switzerland. 2006 ;January 2: FARC exclaimed that a prisoner exchange with the Uribe administration would be \\"very difficult\\". ;January 26: Foreign Minister of France Philippe Douste-Blazy met with the Colombian government in Bogot√° to explore different ways to achieve the prisoner exchange. ;October 19 and October 20: A car bomb exploded in a military installation causing no casualties.

Uribe then ordered a military operation to rescue the hostages. 2007 ;April 27: FARC released a fifth video of the hostages and the last one showing 11 of them alive. In the video the hostages asked Uribe for the demilitarization of Florida and Pradera municipalities. ;May 25: Uribe announced a massive freedom of guerrilla inmates alleging \\"Reasons of State\\" including the notorious \\"FARC guerrilla chancellor\\" Rodrigo Granda. On June 4 it became known that the liberation of Granda was agreed upon a petition by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. ;June 28: FARC announced the death of 11 of the 12 deputies in a \\"crossfire\\" with unknown forces. The only hostage survivor was deputy Sigifredo L√≥pez who for security reasons was traveling with another group of guerrillas. ;September 9: The Red Cross announced, after arriving in an undisclosed area using co- ordinates provided by FARC, that it had recovered 11 bodies and was returning them by helicopter to the city of Cali for identification and forensic procedures. Government After the kidnapping the government initiated military operations in the area. Execution \\"was a mistake\\" According to email conversations between guerrillas, found on computers of deceased FARC- commander Ra√∫l Reyes and quoted by several Colombian media, the murder of eleven of the abductees was \\"a mistake\\". According to one e-mail, the guards of the hostages executed the deputies when they mistook approaching fellow FARC-rebels for rebels of the National Liberation Army (ELN). \\"A big mistake that will cause us a lot of trouble\\", the e-mail says. FARC-commander 'Alfonso Cano' then allegedly ordered his troops to draw attention of military forces, so \\"the enemy\\" could be blamed for the killings. Deserter's testimony On December 25, 2007, a female deserter from the FARC who was at one point guarding the hostages along with nine other guerrillas. Her mission in late 2005 consisted on guarding three of the hostages until they were relieved by commander 'Ezequiel', from the 'Daniel Aldana' guerrilla column. El Tiempo: Captivity of deputies from Valle del Cauca was narrated by young guerrilla deserter from the FARC Alleged involvement drugs trafficker Colombian television station RCN reported on May 21, 2008, the whole kidnapping operation was masterminded and financed by drug trafficker Wilson Figueroa Ord√≥√±ez, alias 'W'. The country's prosecution would be investigating Ord√≥√±ez' 2 billion peso payment to the FARC to finance the kidnapping. Sources within the General Attorney's Office denied the story to Colombian newspaper El Pa√≠s. Liberation of Sigifredo Lopez On December 21, 2008, The FARC announced that they would release Sigifredo Lopez and five other political hostages to Piedad C√≥rdoba as a humanitarian gesture. On February 5, 2009, Sigifredo Lopez was released. After his release, Sigifredo L√≥pez accused the guerrilla group of killing the 11 captives and denied that any military rescue attempt had taken place. According to L√≥pez, the unexpected arrival of another guerrilla unit resulted in confusion and paranoia, leading the rebels to kill the rest of the deputies. He survived because he had been punished for \\"insubordination\\" and was held in chains nearby but separated from the rest of the group.

It starts as a spring near the mountain city of Berovo and it passes near the cities of Makedonska Kamenica, Koƒçani, Vinica and ≈†tip, before joining the river Vardar on its way to the Aegean Sea. Recent issues have concentrated around the pollution of the river, as many of the factories located in the cities through which it passes used it as a dumping ground for waste waters, which is further aggravated with the pesticide-treated waters of the extensive rice fields near the city of Koƒçani. It was the place of Battle of Bregalnica. The Bregalnica watershed The Bregalnica watershed as defined by the Bregalnica River Basin Management Project in 2013 comprises a territory of 4'307 km2, which is approximately 21% of the Vardar watershed in North Macedonia and about 17% of the overall territory of the country. The Bregalnica watershed borders with Bulgaria in the east, Strumica River catchment in the south, Pcunja River in the north, and Vardar River in the west. The average altitude of the Bregalnica watershed is 722 m a.s.l. The Bregalnica river catchment encompasses the territory of the whole East Planning Region. This includes the municipalities of Berovo, ƒåe≈°inovo-Oble≈°evo, Delƒçevo, Karbinci, Makedonska Kamenica, Koƒçani, Pehƒçevo, Probi≈°tip, ≈†tip, Vinica and Zrnovci. It also includes almost the complete territories of Lozovo and Sveti Nikole municipalities (Vardar Region), of Konƒçe Municipality (South-Eastern Region), and a significant portion of the territory of the Kratovo Municipality (25%). Even though the Bregalnica catchment boundary mainly coincides with the municipal boundaries, minor parts of the territory of Radovi≈°, Negotino, Gradsko, Veles, Kumanovo and Kriva Palanka fall into it as well. Geology In terms of geology, the eastern part of North Macedonia including the Bregalnica basin belongs to the Rodopic system (Serbian-Macedonian massif) containing mostly crystallized shales and granites. The formation of these mountains occurred in the Paleozoic, with faults introduced later in the Tertiary. Nowadays, the watershed is characterized by a very varied relief structure, which includes plains, valleys, hilly areas, and mountainous areas. Climate The climate in the Bregalnica catchment is relatively arid, falling predominantly into the modified-continental climate type. Summers are long and dry, often with temperatures as high as +41 ¬∞C, together with mild and wet winters. Rarely, temperatures can get as low as -22 ¬∞C in winter. The average mean annual temperature in the plains is 12.9 ¬∞C, and in higher parts, such as Maleshevo around 8.7 ¬∞C. The average annual precipitation in the region varies between 506 Millimeters in Kochansko Pole and 672 mm in Maleshevo. Rainfall is maximal in the months of April and May, and minimal in the summer months of July and August. Snow may fall from December until March. Flora and fauna Specific climatic conditions, as well as the geological diversity in the region, create conditions for a heterogeneous natural vegetation and differentiation of altitude belts. The region is home to multiple plant communities, including geographically restricted national endemics (e.g. Salvia jurisicii). The abundance of forests in the region is linked to 25 different tree species, with multiple subspecies. The forests have an important function in increasing water storage and reducing soil erosion as well as in maintaining biological diversity. The total forested area in the catchment is 1'157 km2 or around 27% of the territory of the region. There exists a great variety of animal species in the region, comprising amphibians, reptiles, insects, birds and mammals. The group of birds and mammals form numerous associations with a large number of individual animals that can be found from the lowest to the highest altitudes. In the forests, the fauna is particularly rich. The critically endangered sage species Salvia jurisicii is endemic to the steppe-like Ovche Pole basin, part of the Bregalncia Watershed. Resources The region is rich in mineral resources, including important lead‚Äìzinc mines in Zletovo, Dobrevo and Makedonska Kamenica. The presence of copper and iron-titanium minerals has been established in the Osogovo massif. On the territory of Delcevo, gold deposits as well as alluvial gold in river deposits from the Bregalnica river have been found. Finally, there is a major copper mine (the Bucim) near Radovi≈°.  Demography  In the country context, the region is relatively sparsely populated with around 50.6 inhabitants per km2, compared to 82.7 in North Macedonia. The average age is 40 years, which is higher than the national average. The education level is average as for the country. The unemployment rate is lower than the national average (18.5%). The net average salary in 2012 is the lowest in the country (MKD 14'957 per month), at 71.6% of the national average. Over the last two decades, a lack of higher education employment opportunities in most rural settlements resulted in a population migration to the towns and abroad. The main economic activities in the region are mining and industry, followed by services, trade and agriculture. The Bregalnica River The Bregalnica watershed according to the Bregalnica River Basin Management Project, covers a territory of 4,307 km¬≤, which is about 21% of the Vardar River watershed and 17% of the total territory of the country.Bregalnica River hydrology The average altitude of the Bregalnica basin is 772 m. The Bregalnica river has 6 tributaries on the left side (Ratevska, Osojnica, Zrnovska, Kozjacka, Otinja, and Lakavica) and 6 tributaries on the right side (Zelevica, Kamenicka, Orizarska, Kocanska, Zletovica and Svetinikolska). Along the river, 6 major reservoirs have been constructed: Lake Berovsko/Ratevsko, Kalimanci, Gradce, Zletovsko Ezero/Knezevo, Mantovo and Mavrovica. The source of the river is located in the forests of the Male≈°evo Mountains, close to the border of Bulgaria, east of the city of Berovo, in an altitude of around 1690 m a.s.l. The Bregalnica River leads into the Vardar river on an altitude of 137 m a.s.l., close to the village of Gradsko.

Some of the industries have wastewater treatment plants. However, much urban waste water are released untreated. Although there are seven urban waste water treatment plants in the whole river basin, only one is operational. Most of the urban waste water discharges occur into small streams with low flow and consequently, low capacity for self-cleansing. There are several mid-size industrial enterprises performing different activities: pig and poultry farming, food processing, metal processing and finishing, production and finishing of textiles, construction and wood industries, production of ceramics and production of chemicals. A minor point-source pressure is fish farming. From these industrial activities, metal processing and leather and textile industries are major sources of pollutants. Several mines exist with direct waste water discharges to water courses, containing such heavy metals from active lead and zinc mines in Zletovo and Toranica. The pressures associated with diffuse pollution are important throughout the basin due to the high density of both agricultural lands and livestock farming occurring in certain areas in the basin. Livestock farming includes pig farms and poultry, with the dung spread directly to the land. Another main issue concerning diffuse pollution is the existence of several mines throughout the basin. Although some of them have direct discharges in water courses, the metals contained in the soils extracted can also reach surface waters through runoff. Finally, the disposal of solid wastes and wastes from agricultural activity in the river banks is another pressure that significantly contributes to the organic pollution of the water. The Bregalnica River Basin Management Project Macedonian Water Law The river Bregalnica in Zrnovci In 2004, Macedonia submitted an application to become EU member. To prepare EU membership, North Macedonia has to implement EU compatible legislations. An important step towards this target was done in 2008 with the approval of the new Macedonian Water Law, which introduces the River Basin Management (RBM) approach in line with the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). To bring forward the implementation of the new Macedonian Water Law and the RBM approach, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning (MOEPP) and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) started in 2012 a collaboration with the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Actors MOEPP, MAFWE and SECO selected the Bregalnica river basin as pilot region to apply the RBM approach. The project started in July 2012 and is co-financed by SECO, MOEPP, MAFWE, and the municipalities of the Bregalnica region. The project is carried out by a team of national and international experts, supported by a steering committee, a Bregalnica RBM Advisory Council, and a Bregalnica Basin Planning Group. The latter comes in the form of several rounds of sub-regional workshops, each time carried out in three sub-regions (i.e. Upper Bregalnica, Middle Bregalnica and Lower Bregalnica). Objectives The main objective of the project is the sustainable management of the water resources in the Bregalnica river basin, by this promoting the economic development of the region, stimulating industry, agriculture and tourism. The enforcement of the Macedonian water law through the project should bring about the improvement of the water and sanitation services in the Bregalnica River Basin. The project is divided into the following two components: * The Bregalnica River Basin Management (RBM) Plan, comprising the analysis of the current and future situation of the water resources and demand in the Bregalnica region, the identification of possible conflicts and the identification of improvement measurements. Additionally it comprehends the definition and putting into operation of the necessary organizational structures. * The Small Water Infrastructure (SWI) Projects, comprising the establishment and operation of an investment fund to provide financing for small water infrastructure projects, including support to the municipalities of the Bregalnica river basin in the planning, tender de-sign, contracting and implementation of the projects.

The Hawaiian princess Laya has resigned herself to these new circumstances and prefers to lives in Paris where her parents had sent her as a girl for her education. It was already arranged when she was a child that she would once marry Prince Lilo-Taro, but he prefers a life of travel over his home land. Many natives resent the American occupation. The Royalist Party has elected Kanako Hilo as their leader and they hope he will succeed to break the colonial yoke. Governor Harrison plans to marry his niece Bessi to Lilo-Taro to gain influence over the Hawaiian leadership. However, Harrioson's secretary, John Buffy, dislikes this plan because he is drawn to Bessi himself. Captain Stone arrives in Honolulu. On board his ship are a pair of artists: the young man is the famous jazz singer Jim-Boy, and the lady accompanying him pretends to be the no less famous singer Susanne Provence. In fact, she is Princess Laya, intent to remain incognito for a while on her return home. During the journey, Captain Stone has fallen in love with the \\"singer\\". When Kanako Hilo discovers the singer's true identity he hopes to win her as an ally in the battle against the occupiers. The Princess is not in favour of this idea, despite her being welcomed by the people as a Queen. Act 2 Hall of the Royal Palace in Honolulu It is custom to elect a young lady as the Queen of the annual flower festival, her title: \\"Flower of Hawaii\\", and Princess Laya is to be this year's Queen. Governor Harris is concerned that the people will take this event as a trigger to revolt against the occupiers. He demands that Princess Laya sign a declaration in the name of the Hawaiian people to renounce all claims of sovereignty. When she refuses, the Governor declares her an enemy of the state and commands Captain Stone to arrest her. Filled with deep admiration for the Princess, he refuses, risking his job. To save him, Laya signs the declaration. Lilo-Taro -who by now has fiercely fallen in love with his arranged bride- misinterprets this gesture and flees in desperation to the ocean to kill himself. Now it is clear to Laya where her heart belongs. Act 3 A Chinese bar in Monte Carlo Here, all those whose lives were connected in Hawaii meet again where the real Suzanne Provence performs. Stone and Lili- Taro have become friends since the captain saved the prince's life at the ocean. Witty and inventive, John Buffy manages to straighten out the relationships, winning Bessi for himself, and ensuring that Laya and Lilo-Taro find each other. Stone seeks consolation with Suzanne, Laya's look-alike, which is welcomed by Jim-Boy who brought the alluring Raka from Hawaii and didn't quite know how to tell his former lover Suzanne about his intentions - four happy couples.

In the 20th century numerous ethnographic and folkloric ensembles were established in Ukraine and gained popularity. During the Soviet era, music was a controlled commodity and was used as a tool for the indoctrination of the population. As a result, the repertoire of Ukrainian folk music performers and ensembles was controlled and restricted.  Vocal music   Scholarship and Ukrainian vocal folk music   Authentic folk singing  Ukrainians, particularly in Eastern Ukraine have fostered a peculiar style of singing ‚Äì The White voice (). This type of singing primarily exploits the chest register and is akin to controlled yelling or shouting. The vocal range is restrictive and in a lower tessitura. In recent times vocal courses have been established to study this particular form of singing. Among the most popular exponents of traditional Ukrainian folk singing in the modern era are Nina Matviyenko and Raissa Kyrychenko.  Authentic folk singing ensembles  Ensemble singing in 3 and occasionally 4 part harmony was one of the features of traditional village music in Ukraine. The multi-part singing used in Central Ukraine was thought to have been unique at the turn of the 19th century. Numerous folk choirs were established (Okhmatinsky choir) and studies published of the style of choral singing. It was supported in the Soviet period in opposition to church music, as village song was viewed by the authorities as being more proletarian. In recent times (post 1980s) there is a movement toward authentic ensemble singing particularly in eastern Ukraine with the establishment of various ensembles and festivals there focusing on this style of music. Notable groups who perform in this tradition are Dyke Pole and Bozhychi.  Folkloric ensembles  The first such ensemble in Ukraine was the Okhmatynsky Village Folk Choir organized by Dr Mykola Demutsky in 1889. Ethnographic ensembles became popular in the 20th century. These were usually choirs often with orchestral accompaniment and sometimes a group of dancers. They originally performed works based on the ethnic folk music of the area, however over the past 40 years they have become more academic regarding their performance style and material. The most prominent professional groups are: * State Academic Merited Ukrainian Folk Choir named after Hryhory Veriovka (established 1943) Regional groups include: * Veselka - (now known as Poltava) (est. 1987, Poltava) * Donbas - merited miners ensemble of song and dance (est. 1937 Donetsk) * Podolianka - ensemble of song and dance (est. 1938 Khmelnytsk) * Bukovyna merited ensemble of song and dance (est. 1944, Chernivtsi) * Transcarpathian merited folk choir (est. 1945, (Uzhhorod) * Verkhovyna - merited Carpathian ensemble of song and dance (est. 1946, Drohobych) * Lionok - Polissia ensemble of song and dance (est. 1970, Zhytomyr) * Tavria - Women's vocal-choreographic ensemble (est 1971, Simferopol) * Slavutych - ensemble of song and dance (est. 1972, Dnipropetrovsk) * Volyn Folk Choir (est. 1978, Lutsk) * Zoria ensemble (est. 1987, Rivne) Characteristics of these choirs was the use of chest register singing (particularly in Eastern Ukraine) and the use of Ukrainian folk instruments in the accompanying orchestras.  Art singing  In the 20th century, popular operatic singers like Modest Mencinsky and Solomea Krushelnycki included Ukrainian folk songs in their concert performances. Other prominent Ukrainian singers include Ivan Kozlovsky, Borys Hmyria, Anatoliy Solovianenko have also propagated the singing of Ukrainian folk songs and romances. In the United States Kvitka Cisyk also promoted art song.  Choral art singing  Choral singing has a rich tradition in Ukraine. While the Catholic West developing sophisticated vocal instrumental works, the Orthodox church frowned on the use musical instruments in sacred music and a cappella choral music was the only genre that was actively supported. As a result, sacred choral music flowered in Ukraine and it became a prime provider of singers for the Russian courts and Russian orthodox cathedral choirs. In the 20th century notable Ukrainian a cappella choirs have included the Ukrainian National Choir, Dumka (choir), Kiev frescoes and Boyan which is the touring choir of the L. Revutsky Capella of Ukraine. Notable choral conductors include Olexander Koshetz, Wolodymyr Kolesnyk, Nestor Horodovenko, Dmytro Kotko. Vocal instrumental music   Accompanied singing  In Ukraine there existed a class of professional musicians who sang to their own instrumental accompaniment. These professional musicians were often known as kobzari or lirnyky. This category also includes players of the torban and bandura. The repertoire of these itinerant musicians differed considerably from that sung by the folk including the performance of dumy (sung epic poems). In the 20th century the vocal-instrumental tradition has grown into a movement where ensembles and whole choirs sing to their own accompaniment on these instruments. Notable examples include the Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus, The Canadian Bandurist Capella and the Kiev Bandurist Capella. Traditional instrumental music General Ukrainians have a wealth of folk instruments and a well-developed tradition of instrumental music. This is particularly because the Soviet government strongly discouraged the population away from religious music and encouraged \\"proletarian\\" forms of musical performance. The bulk of the ethnic Ukrainian population lived in a village setting and did not share the urban culture of the city based elite that controlled the country. As a result, traditional music village music was encouraged and fostered.  Scholarship of instrumental music  The first significant scholarship dealing with authentic Ukrainian folk instrumental music traditions is ascribed to the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko and his publications starting in 1874 was dealing with the bandura and other Ukrainian folk instruments. Further scholarship was undertaken in the early 20th century by enthno-musicologist Filaret Kolessa and Klyment Kvitka. Publications in the new science of organology were undertaken by Hnat Khotkevych with his 1930 monograph \\"Musical instruments of the Ukrainian people\\". It was banned by the Soviet authorities in 1934 because it studied the phenomena of folk instruments from a national perspective. After WWII scholarship was continued by Andriy Humeniuk who began the trend of mixing Soviet innovations in instrument construction and training with authentic instrumental music. This tendency was avoided by Sofia Hrytsa but became a feature of the publications of Victor Hutsal, Victor Mishalow and the bulk of Soviet and post-Soviet scholarship. In recent times this trend has taken an about-face with the publications by the ethomusicologist Mykhailo Khai of the early 21st century which has clearly separated Ukrainian instrumental music into so called authentic and so called fakeloric instrumental music traditions. Significant contributions to the study of Ukrainian organology and performance have been done by both Russian and Polish ethno-musicologists such as Alexander Famintsyn and Stanislaw Mzrekowski.

Many Ukrainian melodies have become popular in Poland, Slovakia, Austria, Russia, Romania and Moldova. Through the interaction with the Eastern European Jewish community, Ukrainian folk songs such as \\"Oi ne khody Hrytsiu\\" composed by songstress Marusia Churai have been introduced into North American culture as \\"Yes my darling daughter\\" (sung by Dinah Shore). Classical music The traditional music of the kobzari inspired the Dumky composed by various Slavic composers such as Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky and Dvo≈ô√°k. The use of folk melodies is especially encouraged in ballet and opera. Among the Ukrainian composers who often included Ukrainian folk themes in their music were Mykola Lysenko, Lev Revutsky, Mykola Dremliuha, Yevhen Stankovych, Aleksandr Shymko, Myroslav Skoryk (who adapted e.g. the folk song Verbovaya Doschechka). \\"Carol of the Bells\\" is a Ukrainian piece, and so was \\"Jingle Bells\\" (some people say \\"Jingle Bells\\" is Russian, but it's actually Ukrainian). Folk-rock and folk-pop music  In the late 1960s and early 1970s Ukrainian folk songs and folk song elements began to be included in pop and rock music in the rock- oriented Kobza ensemble, Smerichka, Opryshky Medikus and many other ensembles. This was driven by the lack of Ukrainian pop songs of the time. In time the genre of folk inspired pop music became significant, particularly inspired by the popularity of the Belarusian group known as Piesnari. Of the Ukrainian groups the longest surviving and most significant was the group known as Kobza. Western music inspired by Ukrainian folk song elements Where Have All the Flowers Gone? Where Have All the Flowers Gone? is a folk song of the 1960s written by Pete Seeger and Joe Hickerson. Seeger found inspiration for the song while on his way to a concert. Leafing through his notebook he saw the passage, \\"Where are the flowers, the girls have plucked them. Where are the girls, they've all taken husbands. Where are the men, they're all in the army.\\" These lines were from a Ukrainian and Cossack folk song referenced in a novel by Mikhail Sholokhov, And Quiet Flows the Don. Seeger adapted it to a tune, a lumberjack version of \\"Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill\\". With only three verses, he recorded it once in a medley on a Rainbow Quest album and forgot about it. Joe Hickerson later added verses four and five. Carol of the Bells ::See Carol of the Bells. Summertime \\"Summertime\\" is an aria composed by George Gershwin for the 1935 opera Porgy and Bess. The lyrics are by DuBose Heyward, the author of the novel Porgy on which the opera was based, although the song is also co-credited to Ira Gershwin by ASCAP.\\"Summertime\\" at ASCAP It has since become a jazz standard. While it is primarily a spiritual in the style of the African American folk music of late nineteenth century,Howard Pollack, George Gershwin: his life and work, University of California Press, 2006, p.589William Hyland, George Gershwin: a new biography, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p.171 the Ukrainian-Canadian composer and singer Alexis Kochan has suggested that some part of Gershwin's inspiration may have come from having heard the Ukrainian lullaby, Oi Khodyt Son Kolo Vikon (A Dream Passes By The Windows) at a New York City performance by Oleksander Koshetz's Ukrainian National Chorus in 1929 (or 1926).Helen Smindak DATELINE NEW YORK: Kochan and Kytasty delve deeply into musical past, The Ukrainian Weekly, 24 May 1998 See also *Music of Ukraine References External links * Polyphony Project - Ukraine‚Äôs largest online archive of musical folklore * Samples and Pictures of Ukrainian Instruments * –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ –ó—ñ–±—Ä–æ–≤ - –ú—É–∑–∏—á–Ω–∏–π —Ñ—ñ–ª—å–º - –°–ø–æ–≥–∞–¥ 1990 —Ä—ñ–∫ Category:Ukrainian musical instruments ","title":"Ukrainian folk music"},{"id":"13045827","text":"Dittligsee is a lake in the Canton of Berne, Switzerland, near Blumenstein and Wattenwil.

He scored 1,753 points in his three varsity seasons (1954‚Äì1957), led the Mustangs to three consecutive Southwest Conference championships, and was named to three All-SWC teams. Coach Hayes' strategy was simple: \\"[W]hen Jim is free, feed it to the big man.\\" In 1956, Krebs' team reached the NCAA National Semifinals, where they faced Bill Russell and the University of San Francisco. SMU lost 68‚Äì86, but Krebs did outscore future Hall of Famer Russell 24‚Äì17. The next year, Krebs earned consensus All-American honors and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the headline: \\"Big Jim and the Texas Boom\\".

During Krebs' collegiate career, basketball became so popular at SMU that the school constructed a new, $2.25 million basketball arena in 1956 ‚Äî Moody Coliseum, which the Mustangs use to this day. Other schools in the Southwest Conference, who had mainly emphasized college football, took notice of Krebs' success and increased funding for their own basketball programs.  NBA  After his senior season at SMU, Krebs was selected by the Minneapolis Lakers with the third overall pick in the 1957 NBA draft. He played with the Lakers (who moved to Los Angeles in 1960) for seven seasons, mostly in a reserve role behind Vern Mikkelsen, Larry Foust or Rudy LaRusso. The team reached the NBA Finals three times (1959, 1962 and 1963), but lost each series to Bill Russell's Boston Celtics. Over his career, Krebs posted statistics of 8.0 points per game, 6.2 rebounds per game and 0.8 assists per game. His statistically strongest season occurred in 1961‚Äì62, when he averaged 10.0 points and 7.9 rebounds. Krebs occasionally struggled with foul trouble while in the NBA.

He built a home for his wife and children in Woodland Hills. On May 6, 1965, Krebs was suddenly killed while trying to remove a tree that had fallen onto his neighbor's roof during a storm. A limb from the tree struck him in the head as it fell from the roof in an uncontrolled fashion. His wife was pregnant with a son, who was born two months later.

Fosser's puppet production Opera in Focus is a troupe which performs opera and musical theater with some of the world's most sophisticated puppets. The Opera in Focus puppet opera theater is located in Rolling Meadows, Illinois. History Fosser, a puppeteer and artistic director of the legendary Kungsholm Miniature Opera in Chicago, began designing the puppets that would eventually be used in his Opera in Focus productions in the late 1930s. The cost involved in building each elaborately articulated puppet prevented him from constructing them until 1956. He presented the first Opera in Focus performances‚Äîby invitation only‚Äîin 1958 in a rented store on the north side of Chicago, where they were received with great enthusiasm. Pagliacci In order to support the puppet opera, Fosser made a living as a set designer and art director in the motion picture industry, working on such films as Ordinary People, Home Alone, Backdraft, Weird Science, Music Box, Damien: Omen II, The Breakfast Club, A League of Their Own and Groundhog Day. He also worked as a set designer for live theatrical productions, designing scenery for the Lyric Opera of Chicago, as well as the Candlelight, Ivanhoe, and Drury Lane theaters. He spent his free time further developing and perfecting his puppets and the presentation of his elaborate miniature operatic productions. Due to the hectic nature of his career in the film industry, performances of Opera in Focus were infrequent, except for periods in 1962-1963 and 1978-1979 when Opera in Focus enjoyed residencies in Detroit and at the now-defunct Magic Pan restaurant in Chicago. In 1993 the Rolling Meadows Chamber of Commerce offered Fosser a permanent home in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, where Opera in Focus has been performed weekly ever since.Puppet Love: Bill Fosser's Quest to Keep Miniature Opera Alivearticle in Illinois Parks & Recreation, May/June 1995 In 2005 Fosser received the President's Award from the Puppeteers of America. Opera in Focus has received a number of awards including the prestigious Dorothy Mullen Award from the National Parks and Recreation Association for Fine Arts Programming. William Fosser died of congestive heart failure and pneumonia on February 19, 2006, in Resurrection Hospital, in Chicago. He was buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois.Fosser's Obituary The theater continues to present a stunning sampling of fully staged scenes from well-known operas & musicals. Each hour-long performance may offer between three and five scenes, depending on the length of the individual segments. A narration of the action by the well-known actor, Tony Mockus, precedes each scene. The 16\\" puppets are manipulated from below the stage floor and are capable of very lifelike action and dramatic gestures for which opera singers are so famous. A demonstration of the puppet operation and a tour of the highly technical backstage area follow each performance. Despite the small stage (only five feet wide and two feet deep), the illusion of live opera prevails. The puppet opera performances are capable of charming a wide range of audiences - from the lovers of opera and musical theater to those simply fascinated by the fine art of puppetry.

About 1859 two Catholic priests, Father Machebeuf (later the first Bishop of Denver) and Father Ussell, traveled from Santa Fe to visit the little town of Guadalupe. On arrival they were met by Lafayette Head and Don Jesus Velasques, \\"the principal men of this miniature commonwealth.\\" In his account of the trip, Father Ussell noted that Head was a convert to Catholicism, had been baptized by Bishop Lamy, and married a Mexican lady from a very good family. Ussell described the houses of Head and Velasquez as having only two rooms each - a kitchen and a large hall. Head's home served as a temporary church for two days while Fathers Machebeuf and Ussell heard hundreds of confessions and offered communion. Guadalupe sat in lowland along the river and was subject to flooding. The residents had selected a better site on high ground between the Conejos River and San Antonio Creek and laid out plans for a new town called Conejos.

In October of that year Head served as a member of the Commission appointed to finalize the treaty with the Utes. A handful of government representatives, accompanied by a military contingent, met at Head's ranch with 1,500 Utes.Smith, P. David, Ouray: Chief of the Utes, Wayfinder Press, 1990, pages59-66.

The features of this outfit include nanotechnology, built-in sensors, and physical augmentations.  The ACU  Nanotechnology *Chameleonic camouflage - Technology embedded in the fabric of the uniform, most likely chemical receptors, would change color autonomously to blend in with the surrounding environment. This fabric is black when inactive. *Liquid armor - The fabric might also be treated with shear thickening fluid, a mix of polyethylene glycol and nanoscale glass particles. This mix would function like chainmail, flexible with low speed motion such as running, but hard and solid against high speed motion such as that of a bullet impact, preventing serious injury or death. The technology has already proven effective when combined with Kevlar armor. Sensory equipment *Internal sensors - Thermal sensors monitoring both the environment and the soldier would automatically adjust the temperature of the uniform, keeping the wearer as comfortable as possible. Other sensors would detect injuries, the intake of harmful chemicals, and other physical harm, and built-in medical equipment would administer treatment as best able. *Situational awareness - A front-mounted video camera, vision aides (such as night vision sensors) and sound detectors providing three- dimensional audiological hearing would be embedded in the uniform's helmet. The face visor would act as a heads-up display, voice-activated to show ground maps, locations of fellow troops, and other needed information. *Communication - Real-time transmission would allow home base to see and hear everything the soldier does. This allows for provisions such as interlingual translation or sudden change of orders. Augmentations *Internal respirator - A breathing device built into the helmet eliminates the need for gas masks. *XO Muscles - An exoskeletal structure on the legs permits the wearer to carry two to three times their body weight and feel only one time their body weight, increasing effective speed and endurance. No such enhancement is built into the arms or main body. Projections Soldier 2025 was showcased at the 24th Army Science Conference in 2004.

Pavshyno is the site of a \\"Temporary Detention Centre\\" for refugees. Naming and German culture Sometimes transliterated from Cyrillic as Pawschino, Pavschino, Povshin, Pavshyn, Pawsin, Pausin or Pausyn, All of those names are/were attempts to render 'Pausching' into and out of various local languages, Pausching being the (Schwabian) name of the village since about 1750, before which it had been known as Posahaza. To this day, the village has a German Catholic Kirche and about one third of population identified themselves as German. Military installations Map of Dnepr radar site at Mukachevo. The two arrays are at 196 and 260 degrees (south and west) The site is a former military base which housed RSD-10 Pioneer (SS-20) missiles allegedly aimed at targets in Belgium. It is now managed by Military Unit 2142 of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine. In 2002 it was turned into a detention centre. Near Pavshyno is also located Dnepr radar that was officially closed in 2009. The radar was served by a nearby settlement of Shenborn also located near Mukacheve Airport in woods. The village is located on highway and south of it is located Mukacheve Airport. Pavshyno Detention Center December 2002 In December 2002 Tristina Moore filed a report for BBC news. She was able to visit Pavshino with a film crew. She reported that about 100 detainees were kept ten to a room, some only having mattresses to sleep on. She said there was no heating despite a winter approaching with temperatures dropping to -10C. The budget to feed each detainee was 2 hryvnias (0.40‚Ç¨). She quoted Guy Ouellet of the UNHCR, Kiev as saying \\"Once anyone has applied for asylum status, they should be held in open accommodation. And that's not happening.\\" Ukraine: Grim gateway to new Europe accessed 1 September 2007,Moore's video report accessed 09-09-07, Transcript of video report accessed 09-09-07 June 2003 In June 2003, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, (IFRCRCS), reported an influx of detainees meaning Pavshino then contained 320 detainees over half of whom were Chinese. Strict quarantine controls were in place because of fear of the SARS infection. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society submitted a request for 30,000 CHF to supply basic food, medicines and hygiene items plus the services of a doctor and psychologist to help with the needs of undocumented migrants.Western Ukraine Migrants Information Bulletin No.2/2003, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, accessed 1 September 2007 September 2003 In September 2003, the IFRCRCS sent a delegate from Minsk to visit Pavshino. This led to the Ukrainian Red Cross including a programme on migration in the annual International Federation Appeal 2004 which would help organising the sending and receiving of correspondence, organising language courses and lectures on health, humanitarian and legal issues.Western Ukraine: Influx of Irregular Migrants Information Bulletin No.1/2003, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, accessed 1 September 2007 October 2005 The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) organised a delegation to visit Ukraine, including the Pavshino Temporary Detention Centre, and similar facilities at Chop, Uzhorod and Mukachevo. Major General B. M. Marchenko, Acting head of the Border protection department of the Border Guard Service liaised with them. The delegation made the immediate observation that three years after their first visit, the Pavshino facility \\"- in terms of material conditions, staff and medical care - was still clearly unsuitable for the needs of the people being held there.\\" The delegation requested the withdrawal from service of this facility and that replacement facilities be designed and put in place without delay. They noted that the authority appointed to take charge of foreign nationals would require adequate resources, including budgetary resources. In a letter sent in response by the Ukrainian authorities dated 23 January 2006, provided information about how this immediate observation was being addressed. The CPT observed that this response was inadequate, and constituted a significant violation of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The report further notes that the Council of Ministers had decided to transfer the responsibility for the detention of foreign nationals to the Ministry of Internal Affais, but that this ministry was only prepared to take responsibility for new centres, which the letter of 23 January 2006 confirmed had received a budget. Meanwhile, the State Border Guard Service denied having responsibility for the facility, whilst in fact exercising day-to-day control. The CPT reported that there had been complaints of mistreatment prior to July 2005, but that this had not been a problem since a change of staff at that time. They recommended that: :*\\"ill treatment of persons deprived of liberty and verbal abuse is unacceptable and will be severely sanctioned\\"; :*\\"no more force than is necessary should be used when affecting an apprehension and that, once apprehended persons have been brought under control, there can be no justification for striking them\\". Whilst noting some improvements to the facility since the CPT visit of 2002, the 205 delegation noted that such developments were cancelled out by the fact that 393 detainees were occupying a space earmarked for 250. Some detainees merely had a mattress on the floor whilst others were sleeping two to a bed. In one room 21 men occupied 16m2 with only 14 beds. despite the assistance of humanitarian organisations, clothing and footwear was inadequate for the forthcoming winter, and that inmates had to use buckets or even plastic bags, as no other toilet facilities were available from 8pm to 8am. Medical provisions were severely limited. There was little evidence that a feldsher was available, and there was no regular medical provision or monitoring, creating the danger of outbreak of serious illnesses in the cramped conditions. The CPT for the second time invoked article 8, paragraph 5 of the Convention, calling on the facility to be withdrawn from service. The CPT also noted that there was no disciplinary code, and that the locking up of individuals in solitary confinement with no toilet facilities was unacceptable. They requested a response within one month.Council of Europe Anti-Torture Committee visits Ukraine accessed 07-09-07 August 2007 A protest was made outside the camp on 17 August 2007,Report from the Ukrainian No Border Camp accessed 30 August 2007 and the camp is the subject of an ongoing campaign for its closure.Freedom of Movement for Everyone accessed 30 August 2007 References *In front of the border fence of Europe, accessed 21-0Œ≤-07 *Council of Europe Anti-Torture Committee visits Ukraine accessed 21-0Œ≤-07 *Information on Pawschino and other detention centers in ukraine *Article on Pawschino by Austrian Reporter Florian Klenk (German) Category:Immigration detention centers and prisons Category:Illegal immigration to Europe Category:Prisons in Ukraine Category:Military installations of the Soviet Union Category:Strategic Rocket Forces Category:Villages in Mukacheve Raion Category:Populated places in Mukacheve Raion ","title":"Pavshyno"},{"id":"13046103","text":"William H.

The library is an independent institution owned by a charitable trust. It is located at 37 Holden Road, North Finchley, London. The library is named after Francysk Skaryna, a Belarusian and East-Slavonic publishing pioneer. Collections Currently, the book collection is estimated to contain over 30,000 volumes, among them over 20 printed before 1800. The strongest areas of the collection are history, literature, language, religion, folklore, local lore, bibliography, music and art. All standard reference works are available. A collection of expatriate publications, both books and periodicals, is fairly comprehensive. New publications from Belarus are being purchased regularly, as well as all important Belarus-related works appearing abroad in any language. Most of books are in Belarusian language, a fair number in Russian and Polish, fewer in German, French and other languages. The library receives over 40 current periodicals from Belarus and abroad. The serials collection has over 200 titles; some of them are rare pre-1939 publications. The cartographic collection consists of over 100 maps from the sixteenth century onwards. The collection of Belarusian music records on LPs is comprehensive; more recent records on cassettes and CDs are collected episodically, with the emphasis on folk, rock and classical music. The archive is extensive; it is the least studied area of the library collection. It contains Church documents of the 18 and 19th centuries, materials dating from the period of the Belarusian Democratic Republic (1918), archives of Belarusian organisations and personalities in exile. History The history of the Library collection began with the establishment of the Belarusian Catholic Mission in London in 1947 and its move to Marian House on Holden Avenue in the following year. There, a small (two to three hundred) but valuable collection of Belarusian books brought to England by Fr ƒåeslaus Sipoviƒç was housed in the southward- facing room on the first floor, immediately above the Mission's chapel. The Library served as a study centre and meeting place for the student associations ≈Ωyƒácio and Ru≈Ñ, and was used by a number of scholars interested in Belarusian heritage. In the following decade, the book collection increased tenfold and by 1957 was supplemented by subscriptions to all the main periodicals appearing in the BSSR and Belarusian diaspora. In 1958 it received a name Bibliotheca Alboruthena. In the same year, Fr Leo Garoshka moved from Paris to join the Belarusian Catholic community in London. He brought with him an excellent private library, which included a number of rare books published in western Belarus before the Second World War. This collection was added to the Bibliotheca Alboruthena making it the largest Belarusian library in western Europe. Frequently, the library was receiving further collections and items from visitors and Belarusians around the world. When in 1960 Fr ƒåeslaus Sipoviƒç was appointed Bishop and Apostolic Visitor of Belarusians in 1960, he was succeeded by Fr Leo Garoshka as the Bibliotheca Alboruthena's librarian. In 1960s, there was made the first attempt to catalogue the collection. In 1968 the book collection was over 6,500 volumes and growing on the account of developing interest to the Belarusian Studies in British universities. In these circumstances it was decided to purchase a whole building to house the library collection (except the religious books not relevant to the Belarusian studies), its archive, as well as the small museum housed, since 1967, in the adjusted building of the St Cyril's Belarusian school. The library was formally opened on 15 May 1971. Before that, in January 1971, Fr Alexander Nadson assumed the role of librarian instead of Fr Leo Garoshka appointed Director of the Belarusian service of the Vatican Radio. Initially the library was directed by a Board of Governors. In 1979, the Library was registered as a Charitable Trust governed by a Board of Trustees appointed from among members of the Belarusian Catholic (Fr Alexander Nadson, Fr Felix ≈Ωurnia) and Orthodox (Fr J. Piekarski) clergy, representatives of the Belarusian community in Britain (P. Asipovich, J. Dominik, J. Michaluk) and British scholars with a special interest in Belarusian studies (Jim Dingley, Arnold McMillin, Guy Picarda). Bishop ƒåeslaus Sipoviƒç remained its Chair until his death in 1981; he was succeeded by Fr Alexander Nadson. Peter Mayo was appointed a Trustee to succeed Fr ≈Ωurnia who died in 1982. The institution was conceived as a reference library for supporting Belarus-related research; its chief aim was defined as \\"to collect all material, both in printed and manuscript forms, relating to Byelorussia, and to make it accessible to all those interested in any aspect of Byelorussian studies\\". By 1991, it acquired over 12,000 titles with an annual increase of 300-400. It was receiving practically all Belarusian publications, as well as those relating to Belarus, which appeared in BSSR, Poland and the West. In 1990, the Library established an exchange agreement with the Belarusian Academy of Sciences Library, Minsk, which allowed it to receive duplicate copies of publications of the 1920s and 1930s - otherwise unobtainable - in exchange for expensive scholar publications from the West. Its holdings were also enriched considerably by systematic search for old and out-of-print publications and by numerous gifts and bequests from various benefactors. Most books were in Belarusian, but with a considerable number of works in other languages, in particular Polish and Russian. An extensive collection of microfilms and microfiche was also acquired. For the large part of 1990s and 2000s, Prof Adam Maldzis (Minsk) singlehandedly supplied the Library with books and periodicals appearing in Belarus. This was the period of booming publishing in Belarus; eventually, it became impossible to collect all Belarus-related publications appearing worldwide. The library has organised several international seminars and conferences in Belarusian studies. As the health of Fr Alexander Nadson, the long-standing head of the Board of Trustees and primary keeper of the institution, started deteriorating, the Francis Skaryna Belarusian Library and Museum entered the period of decline. It was removed from the list of charitable organisations in 2011 for the lack of activities. In 2014, the Board of Trustees reconvened to revive the institution and ensure its future. The Mission Statement and Aims were adopted revising, for the first time since 1971, the initial aims of the institution: in addition to collecting and preservation of the Belarusian cultural heritage, and supporting the Belarusian studies - to contribute to the life of the Belarusian community in Britain and encourage interest in Belarus among the British public. In 2015, as a confirmation of its revival and important place in the life of the British society, the institution received a new charity registration. Since then, it began a programme of digitisation of its most valuable and rare items, series of events and collaborative working with other institutions in Belarus and other countries. In late 2016, the Church of St Cyril of Turau and All the Patron Saints of the Belarusian People has been built next to the Francis Skaryna Library.

Hanayo currently lives and works in Japan.  Career  In 1989 she began to train as a geisha in Tokyo. She later published an account of the experience in her first book, Oshakuchan No. 1. After studying for a short time at the Sorbonne, she formed the band Muscats in 1992 with Japanese noise musicians Masami Akita (Merzbow) and Masaya Nakahara (Violent Onsen Geisha) . Later that year Hanayo was featured on the cover of The Face magazine's December issue in full geisha attire. In 1993 she modeled for a Jean Paul Gaultier advertising campaign.

In 1997 she met German director and performance artist Christoph Schlingensief. She moved to Berlin and worked with him on several projects, such as portraying Yoko Ono in the performance Mein Filz, mein Fett, mein Hase (English: My Felt, My Fat, My Hare) at documenta X in Kassel, taking part in Schlingensief's performance Passion Impossible at the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, and playing a role in Die letzten Tage der Rosa Luxemburg (English: The Last Days of Rosa Luxemburg) at the Berliner Ensemble.
