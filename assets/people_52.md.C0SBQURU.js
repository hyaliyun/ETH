She was the first black woman to ski at the Olympics, and the youngest alpine ski racer in Olympic history (she competed at age 14). Early life Johnson was born in Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her father was a Tutsi tribesman from Burundi, Africa, and her mother, Suzy, a New Hampshire native, raised Johnson and her half-sister exclusively. Suzy raised Johnson as a vegan from birth, and took her to animal rights protests from a young age. Johnson spent her childhood traveling with her family to numerous countries, living for a time in New Hampshire and Maine, and later moving to Stateline, Nevada, on the shore of Lake Tahoe. Johnson began skiing at the age of seven. After moving to Nevada, she trained at Heavenly Valley Ski Resort while her mother worked at a casino to support the family. Athletic career and activism At age 14, Johnson represented the Virgin Islands in giant slalom and Super-G at the 1988 Winter Olympics, where she became the youngest alpine ski racer and first black female skier in Olympic history. She was also the flag bearer in the opening ceremony. At age 15, Johnson became the first black ski racer to finish in the top 30 in international competition. She competed again for the Virgin Islands in slalom and giant slalom at the 1992 Winter Olympics. As of 2014, she remains the only black woman to ski competitively at the Olympic Games. In 1989, Johnson was disqualified from a World Cup ski race for refusing to wear a suit containing wool and leather. Johnson qualified for the 1994 Winter Olympics, but chose not to compete in protest of Norway's decision to resume whaling. She petitioned the IOC to challenge Japan to end whale and dolphin hunting before the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Johnson has also spoken out against homophobia, criticizing the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia for the \\"horrid anti-gay law that now exists in that host country\\". Education and later pursuits Johnson retired from athletic competition in 1992 to pursue an education in fine arts at Howard University, and to educate youth about health and animal welfare. The racism she experienced as a black skier played a part in her decision to retire early. She is a member of the Screen Actors Guild, and has appeared in commercials and television productions. Johnson lives in Los Angeles and has worked as a special education assistant, has become a Certified Yoga Teacher, and continues to accept requests as an international public speaker. Johnson's skis are on display in the first exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.

It first became known to the public when the project appeared on a self hosted form of git in August 2016 without any official announcement. The name means \\"Pink + Purple = Fuchsia (a new Operating System)\\", which is a reference to Pink (Apple's first effort at an object- oriented, microkernel-based operating system) and Purple (the original iPhone's codename). In contrast to prior Google-developed operating systems such as Chrome OS and Android, which are based on the Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a new kernel called Zircon.  History  In August 2016, media outlets reported on a mysterious codebase post published on GitHub, revealing that Google was developing a new operating system called \\"Fuchsia\\". No official announcement was made, but inspection of the code suggested its capability to run on universal devices, including \\"dash infotainment systems for cars, to embedded devices like traffic lights and digital watches, all the way up to smartphones, tablets and PCs\\". The code differs from Android and Chrome OS due to its being based on the Zircon kernel (formerly called Magenta) rather than on the Linux kernel. In May 2017, Ars Technica wrote about Fuchsia's new user interface, an upgrade from its command-line interface at its first reveal in August, along with a developer writing that Fuchsia \\"isn't a toy thing, it's not a 20% Project, it's not a dumping ground of a dead thing that we don't care about anymore\\". Multiple media outlets wrote about the project's seemingly close ties to Android, with some speculating that Fuchsia might be an effort to \\"re-do\\" or replace Android in a way that fixes problems on that platform. In January 2018, Google published a guide on how to run Fuchsia on Pixelbooks. This was followed successfully by Ars Technica. A Fuchsia \\"device\\" was added to the Android ecosystem in January 2019 via the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Google talked about Fuchsia at Google I/O 2019. Hiroshi Lockheimer, Senior Vice President of Chrome and Android, described Fuchsia as one of Google’s experiments around new concepts for operating systems. On July 1, 2019, Google announced the official website of the development project providing source code and documentation for the operating system.  Overview  Forbes describes Fuchsia: The GitHub project suggests Fuchsia can run on many platforms, from embedded systems to smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. In May 2017, Fuchsia was updated with a user interface, along with a developer writing that the project was not a \\"dumping ground of a dead thing\\", prompting media speculation about Google's intentions with the operating system, including the possibility of it replacing Android. On July 1, 2019 Google announced the homepage of the project, fuchsia.dev, which provides source code and documentation for the newly announced operating system. Fuchsia's user interface and apps are written with Flutter, a software development kit allowing cross-platform development abilities for Fuchsia, Android and iOS. Flutter produces apps based on Dart, offering apps with high performance that run at 120 frames per second. Fuchsia also offers a Vulkan-based graphics rendering engine called Escher, with specific support for \\"Volumetric soft shadows\\", an element that Ars Technica wrote \\"seems custom-built to run Google's shadow-heavy 'Material Design' interface guidelines\\". Due to the Flutter software development kit offering cross-platform opportunities, users are able to install parts of Fuchsia on Android devices. Ars Technica noted that, though users can test Fuchsia, nothing \\"works\\", because \\"it's all a bunch of placeholder interfaces that don't do anything\\". They found multiple similarities between Fuchsia's interface and Android, including a Recent Apps screen, a Settings menu, and a split-screen view for viewing multiple apps at once. After the second review, Ars Technica experts were impressed with the progress, noting that things were then working, and were especially pleased by the hardware support. One of the positive surprises was support for multiple mouse pointers. A special version of Android Runtime for Fuchsia is planned to run from a FAR file, the equivalent of the Android APK. = Kernel = Fuchsia is based on a new messaging-passing kernel called Zircon, named after the mineral. It is not a microkernel due to having more than 170 syscalls. Zircon's code base was derived from that of Little Kernel (LK), a real-time kernel for embedded devices, aimed for low resource consumption, to be used on a wide variety of devices. Little Kernel was developed by Travis Geiselbrecht, who had also coauthored the NewOS kernel used by Haiku. Zircon is written mostly in C++, with some parts in assembly language. It is composed of a kernel with a small set of user services, drivers, and libraries which are all necessary for the system to boot, communicate with the hardware, and load the user processes. It presents features including handling threads, virtual memory, processes intercommunication, and waiting for changes in the state of objects. It is heavily inspired by Unix kernels, and differs greatly. For example, it does not support Unix-like signals but incorporates event-driven programming and the observer pattern. Most system calls don't block the main thread. Resources are represented as objects rather than files, unlike traditional Unix systems.

According to a poem preserved by the ninth to twelfth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Æðelstan's opponents suffered greatly, with five kings, seven earls, and \\"countless of the raiding-army of Seamen and Scots\\" amongst their dead.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Woolf (2007) pp. 169, 172–173; Halloran (2005) p. 133 n. 3. As for Gebeachan, his fall in this conflict is attested by a single source, a seventeenth-century translation of the now lost Annals of Clonmacnoise.Clarkson (2014) ch. 5; Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 527, 527 n. 127; Wood (2013) p. 148; Downham (2013) p. 183; Clancy (2008) p. 26; Etchingham (2001) p. 167; Jennings (1994) pp. 202–203; Murphy (1896) pp. 150–151. The original translator of this source, Conall Mac Eochagáin, is known to have incorporated his own comments and material into his translation. Since the original version no longer exists, it is uncertain what information is accurately interpreted and what originates from Mac Eochagáin himself.Simms (2009) p. 26; Ó Corráin (2006). Nevertheless, this source styles Gebeachan \\"king of the Islands\\", a royal title that appears to be a translated form of the Gaelic rí Innse Gall, and is otherwise first recorded in 989.Jennings (1994) p. 203. \\"Gebeachan\\", the name that the Annals of Clonmacnoise ascribes to him, seems to represent either the Gaelic Gebechán,Downham (2013) p. 183. Giblechán,Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 527 n. 127. or GébennachCharles-Edwards (2013) p. 527 n. 127; Jennings (1994) p. 203.

Another possibility is that the name is derived from gebech, a word for a type of craftsman.Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 527 n. 127; eDIL s.v. Gebech (n.d.). Alternately, Gebeachan's name could be derived from a nickname referring to fetters or bondages.Jennings (1994) p. 205 n. 11; eDIL s.v. Gébend (n.d.). Whatever the case, the name is clearly Gaelic,Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 527 n. 127; Etchingham (2001) p. 167; Jennings (1994) pp. 203, 205 n. 11. which indicates that Gebeachan was unlikely to have been from Orkney,Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 527 n. 127. and more probably centred in the southern Hebrides.Etchingham (2001) p. 167. There is reason to suspect that Gebeachan may have been a subordinate of Amlaíb,Crowcroft; Cannon (2015); Jennings (2015); Downham (2013) p. 183; Etchingham (2001) p. 167; Jennings (1994) pp. 203–205. a monarch styled \\"king of the Irish and the many islands\\" by the twelfth-century Chronicon ex chronicis.Crowcroft; Cannon (2015); Jennings (2015); Forester (1854) p. 97; Stevenson (1853) p. 242; Thorpe (1848) p. 132. If so, Gebeachan's obituary would be evidence of Uí Ímair authority in the Isles in the 930s and 940s.Downham (2013) pp. 183–184. In fact, Gebeachan's attested title suggests that he was one of the five reguli, noted by the Chronicon ex chronicis, who are stated to have fallen supporting Amlaíb at Brunanburh.Jennings (1994) pp. 203–205; Forester (1854) p. 97; Stevenson (1853) p. 242; Thorpe (1848) p. 132. Amlaíb himself died in 941. In an entry following his death, the twelfth-century Chronicon Scotorum records that Muirchertach mac Néill, King of Ailech raided \\"the Isles of Alba\\" in an annal- entry that seems to refer to the southern Hebrides.Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 530; Chronicon Scotorum (2012) § 941; Chronicon Scotorum (2010) § 941; Hudson (2006). This notice may have bearing on Gebeachan's apparent cooperation with Amlaíb, and appears to show that opponents of the Uí Ímair seized the initiative on his death.Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 530. Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters reports that a chieftain named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge.

Associated Builders & Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc., 507 U.S. 218 (1993), is a US labor law case, concerning the scope of federal preemption against state law for labor rights. Facts A corporation claimed that it should not have to abide by a contract it signed with a state government body, to abide by terms of a collective agreement because it was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, a state government body, was ordered to clean up pollution of Boston Harbor after it failed to prevent sewage flowing in. It commissioned Kaiser Engineers, Inc. for the cleanup, and made it agree that it would assure labor stability, and abide by a collective agreement with the Building and Construction Trades Council. Kaiser Inc and the employer lobby then claimed that this agreement was pre-empted under the National Labor Relations Act. The District Court rejected the claim. The Court of Appeals allowed the claim, saying that the labor agreement, as a condition of carrying out work, was an intrusion into the bargaining process and not the sort of peripheral regulation permissible under San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon.. and Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n.. The MWRA appealed. Judgment The Supreme Court held state governments may use their funds to procure corporations to do work that are union or labor friendly. Blackmun J gave the judgment of the Court. > The NLRA contains no express pre-emption provision. Therefore, in accordance > with settled pre-emption principles, we should not find MWRA's bid > specification pre-empted \\"'\\". . . unless it conflicts with federal law or > would frustrate the federal scheme, or unless [we] discern from the totality > of the circumstances that Congress sought to occupy the field to the > exclusion of the States.\\"'\\" ... We are reluctant to infer pre-emption.... > [...] When we say that the NLRA pre-empts state law, we mean that the NLRA > prevents a State from regulating within a protected zone, whether it be a > zone protected and reserved for market freedom, see Machinists, or for NLRB > jurisdiction, see Garmon. A State does not regulate, however, simply by > acting within one of these protected areas. When a State owns and manages > property, for example, it must interact with private participants in the > marketplace. In so doing, the State is not subject to pre-emption by the > NLRA, because pre-emption doctrines apply only to state regulation.

In Machinists, for example, we referred > to Congress' pre-emptive intent to \\"leave some activities unregulated,\\" 427 > U.S., at 144, 96 S.Ct., at 2555 (emphasis added), and held that the > activities at issue—workers deciding together to refuse overtime work—were > not \\"regulable by States.\\" Id., at 149, 96 S.Ct., at 2557 (emphasis added). > In Golden State I, we held that the reason Los Angeles could not condition > renewal of a taxicab franchise upon settlement of a labor dispute was that > \\"Machinists pre-emption . . . precludes state and municipal regulation > 'concerning conduct that Congress intended to be unregulated.' \\" 475 U.S., > at 614, 106 S.Ct., at 1398 (emphasis added) (quoting Metropolitan Life Ins. > Co. v.

See 475 U.S., at 615-619, 106 S.Ct., at 1398-1401. As > petitioners point out, a very different case would have been presented had > the city of Los Angeles purchased taxi services from Golden State in order > to transport city employees.

In that situation, if > the strike had produced serious interruptions in the services the city had > purchased, the city would not necessarily have been pre-empted from advising > Golden State that it would hire another company if the labor dispute were > not resolved and services resumed by a specific deadline.

The fact that > a private actor may \\"regulate\\" does not mean, of course, that the private > actor may be \\"pre-empted\\" by the NLRA; the Supremacy Clause does not require > pre-emption of private conduct. Private actors therefore may \\"regulate\\" as > they please, as long as their conduct does not violate the law. As the above > passage in Gould makes clear, however, States have a qualitatively different > role to play from private parties. Id., at 290, 106 S.Ct., at 1063. When the > State acts as regulator, it performs a role that is characteristically a > governmental rather than a private role, boycotts notwithstanding. Moreover, > as regulator of private conduct, the State is more powerful than private > parties. These distinctions are far less significant when the State acts as > a market participant with no interest in setting policy.

It is considered a pest, particularly to plants in the citrus group. They suck the sap from trees, which causes the flowers and fruit to fall. Taxonomy In 1863, Swedish entomologist Carl Stål described the species as Oncoscelis sulciventris from a collection near Moreton Bay in Queensland. In 1957, English entomologists Dennis Leston and G.G.E. Scudder reclassified the bronze orange bug as Musgraveia sulciventris, due to reorganization of Oncoscelis and related genera. It is the type species of the genus Musgraveia and in the Tessaratomidae family. Description and life cycle Bronze orange bugs first appear in late winter. Mating takes place between late November through early March. Each mating pair takes 3 to 5 days to produce 10 to 14 eggs. The female lays up to four clutches of eggs and deposits them on the undersurface of a leaf. The bright green spherical eggs are around in diameter. The incubation period varies based on current weather conditions. Hatching averages around 7.4 days at 25 °C and 6 percent humidity. As a light green nymph, they are difficult to spot and often mistaken for a different species. The species has five stages of development known as instars. The first instars remain huddled near the eggs. They are transparent pale green with orange eyes. The second instars are more buff or pale yellow. Adults grow to be approximately 25 mm (nearly 1 in) long, and go from orange to their more familiar bronze color as they develop. Distribution and habitat Musgraveia sulciventris is found in Queensland and New South Wales in Eastern Australia, but as far south as Wollongong. Its range of location has spread significantly since European colonization. Ecology Its native host plants include the desert lime (Citrus glauca), the Australian finger lime (Citrus australasica), and Correas. It has become a major pest of cultivated citrus crops, where it sucks the fluid from new growth and young fruit, causing them to turn yellow and drop off. Whole crops can be devastated. The common name of stinkbug refers to a malodorous liquid that the insect sprays when threatened. It is composed of alkanes, cimicine and aldehydes from glands in the thorax. These compounds primarily serve as protection against fellow arthropods, to which they are lethal. However, the defensive chemicals of M. sulciventris are known for being among the most debilitating to vertebrates, which is likely a defense specifically aimed against birds. They can cause damage to human skin and even cause temporary blindness if sprayed into the eyes. The bronze orange bug can spray the liquid at a target up to 0.6 m (2 ft) away. Insects that prey on the bronze orange bug include the common assassin bug (Pristhesancus plagipennis), the predatory Asopinae bug species Amyotea hamatus, and the parasitoid wasps Eupelmus poggioni and Telenomus spp. References Tessaratomidae Insects of Australia Insects described in 1863 ","title":"Musgraveia sulciventris"},{"id":"51328260","text":"Midtown is a mixed-use development district under development in Dallas, Texas (USA).

Albeit early, this is not the first recorded instance of Andean volcanism in northern Chile as the Triassic and Jurassic formations of Cifuncho, Agua Chica, Pan de Azúcar and Posada de los Hidalgos that underlie La Negra Formation do also bear evidence of volcanism. In relation to present-day geography La Negra Arc went from latitude 18°S to 26°S and its orientation was roughly north-south similar to today's disposition of La Negra Formations outcrops. Near Taltal the volcanism of La Negra Arc developed largely in marine conditions with most volcanic eruptions being effusive, yet volcanism was punctuated by large explosive eruptions. Lithology The formation is made up of volcaniclastic rocks, and non- volcaniclastic rocks such as andesite, basalt, basaltic andesites and some lesser amounts of dacite. The non-volcaniclastic rocks correspond variously to lava flows with autobrecciated parts, lava domes, cryptodomes and pillow lavas. The volcaniclastic rocks of the formation include hyaloclastite breccias, peperites and felsic ignimbrites. This last rock type forms at some locations the lowermost parts of the formation. In addition, the formation contains limestone, marl, conglomerate and grey breccias. Geochemistry and petrogenesis The volcanic rocks of La Negra Formation show little diversity in their geochemistry. Fractional crystallization of olivine, plagioclase and pyroxene appear to be the cause of the igneous differentiation that produced basaltic andesites and andesites. The rocks belong to the calc-alkaline magma series and high-K calc-alkaline magma series. The magma series and other geochemical characteristics found in the volcanic rocks of La Negra Formation are characteristic of subduction zone volcanism. The magmas originated in a parcel of Earth's mantle that was metasomatized by fluid derived from the tectonic plate that was subducting beneath what is now Chile. A nearby gabbro body, the Coloso Coastal Gabbro, is thought to share the same origin as the volcanic rocks of La Negra Formation. Metamorphism and mineralization The formation has been subject to mild low-grade metamorphism as evidenced by the occurrence of an epidote-chlorite-calcite-chalcedony-zeolite-prehnite- pumpellyite association. Metamorphism is more pronounced in the brecciated parts of lava flows and near Antofagasta if compared with La Negra Formation near Tocopilla. It hosts numerous small and medium-sized copper deposits whose mineralogy usually grades from chalcopyrite-pyrite-magnetite at deeper levels to chalcosite-tetrahedrite-hematite at shallower levels. The shallower levels of mineralization contains most of the copper oxides. Inside the intrusions that are hosted within La Negra Formation there are several vertical or near- vertical veins bearing chalcopyrite, magnetite and actinolite. Some more rare veins are made up of some of the following associations: silver-gold, iron- copper, iron and nickel-cobalt. All of these veins have similar ages as the larger intrusions. The manto-type copper and silver deposits found in La Negra Formation make up the northern portion of the Chilean Iron Belt.

He was one of the founders of Palo Alto and a trustee of Stanford University for over 50 years. His estate is now the site of the Menlo Park civic center. Timothy Hopkins was born Timothy Nolan in Augusta, Maine in 1859 to Irish immigrants, Patrick and Catherine Nolan. His father moved west to California and once established sent for his family; however, he drowned before they arrived. His mother went to work in the home of the childless Hopkins family who treated Timothy as the child they did not have. They intended to send him to Harvard but Mark Hopkins' death without a will in 1878 changed things. Timothy Hopkins took over much of the financial management of the estate and in 1879 was legally adopted by Mary Hopkins. He eventually became treasurer of the Southern Pacific Railroad successor of the Central Pacific. Timothy Hopkins married Mary Kellogg Crittenden, a niece of Mary Hopkins, in 1882 and were given a 280 acre estate, Sherwood Hall, formerly the Thurlow estate, in Menlo Park (bounded by Ravenswood road, Middlefield road, San Francisquito Creek and the Caltrain railroad tracks); though they also lived in San Francisco.. The estate was established by William Eustace Barron and later owned by Milton Slocum Latham. It is now the site of SRI International and the Menlo Park Civic Center. The gatehouse is the only remaining building from the estate. Across the creek and a little way upstream was the country estate of Leland and Jane Stanford, the future site of Stanford University. In 1884 Leland and Jane Stanford's only child, also Leland, died and in 1885 they named a board of trustees including Timothy Hopkins for their proposed university in memory of their son though the university was not to be opened until 1891. Hopkins was to serve as a trustee until his death in 1936 and was president of the Board of Trustees from 1908-1914. Hopkins, with the Stanfords' support purchased land in what is now the area of Palo Alto around University avenue and in 1887 laid out the plans for a new town, initially called University Park; in 1892 that town became Palo Alto. Lots were sold but under a covenant that forbade the sale of alcoholic beverages and a railroad station was built to serve the new university (Mayfield, a community just to the south with an already existing station was well known for its drinking establishments and the Stanfords wanted a dry town associated with the university). The covenant lasted until 1970. In 1887 his adopted mother, Mary Hopkins, married her interior decorator, Edward Francis Searles, and when she died in 1891 her will explicitly disinherited Timothy Hopkins and left her fortune to her new husband. The will was challenged and though the husband eventually won, Timothy was given several million dollars. In 1892 Hopkins provided the funding to establish the Hopkins Seaside Laboratory on the Monterey Peninsula for the just opened Stanford University. It was moved a short distance and renamed the Hopkins Marine Station in 1917. He and his wife were also involved in the founding of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children which is one of the forebearers of the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. He died on New Years Day 1936 of pneumonia in Stanford Hospital, then located in San Francisco, and was buried on January 3 at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park. Timothy Hopkins' will gave his widow a lifetime use of his estate and at her death in 1941 most of it went to Stanford University. They had one child, Lydia (1887-1965).

It was released online by Funny Or Die Cartoons. Plot =New song= The short opens with Gwar performing \\"Bring Back The Bomb\\" at a venue. Oderus then announces that they have a new song for \\"all you kids\\". He then pulls up a stool and plays an acoustic guitar and sings about putting stuff away. This incites fury from the audience. (With one audience member throwing a beer bottle at Oderus, but hitting Jizmak instead.) When the other band members confront him on the matter, he says he's tired of the violent image the band puts out and wants to make them a children's band, utilizing \\"education through positive music\\". The others are shocked at this revelation. =Doctor= When Pustulus asks if he's high, Oderus says he is indeed high, on life. Beefcake says they need a doctor. The doctor diagnoses Oderus' condition as \\"lead singer menopause\\", an illness that turns people into children's performers. He goes on to say that the cure rests in the highest mountaintops of Antarctica, and that once obtained, it can return Oderus to his regular objectionable self. The doctor wishes them good luck as he goes to use the bathroom. Gwar leaves the room to get the cure while Oderus stays behind to censor Gwar's merchandise. =Birthday party= In another room, Weird Al Yankovic is talking with someone on the phone about performing at a kid's birthday party. Oderus listens in on the conversation and expresses desire to trade places with Weird Al. At that moment, he gets an idea. When Weird Al sees him, he expresses joy at meeting his idol, which quickly turns to horror as Oderus assaults him. Meanwhile, Gwar is climbing an Antarctic mountain where Jizmak suffers a stream of bad luck. (Getting a piece of Beefcake's armor stuck in his eye, getting a pickaxe stuck in his leg by a texting Balsac, getting a second pickaxe stuck in his head by Beefcake, who then throws him at the mountain summit, releasing an undead Tyrannosaurus rex.) Meanwhile, Oderus stops at the birthday party Weird Al was to appear at, wearing Weird Al's face and hair like a mask. He is able to fool the family and get in. Back in Antarctica, Gwar is doing battle with the undead dinosaur when the doctor appears in Beefcake's subconscious and reveals that the cure for Oderus' affliction is in the dinosaur's blood. At that moment, the dinosaur attacks and eats the doctor before getting its head sliced off by Beefcake. Back at the party, Oderus is failing to win the children's favor, with a girl stating that kids like \\"gross out humor\\". At that moment, Weird Al's face slides off, revealing Oderus' true identity. Then, Gwar bursts in and Beefcake injects the cure into Oderus' head, which returns him to normal, to the delight of his bandmates. The band then celebrates by slaughtering everybody at the party. =Post credits= In a post-credits scene, Weird Al is met with upset reactions from the audience and fails to get them happy, swearing revenge on Gwar for ruining him.

Bluespotted flathead are a marine species and are predominantly found in offshore waters and coastal bays on the east coast of Australia where they are almost exclusively found on marine sand. Ecology Flathead are notable for their unusual body shape, upon which their hunting strategy is based. Flathead are dorsally compressed, meaning their body is wide but flattened and very low in height. Both eyes are on the top of the flattened head, giving excellent binocular vision to attack overhead prey. The effect is somewhat similar to flounder. In contrast to flounder however, flathead are much more elongated, the tail remains vertical, and the mouth is large, wide and symmetrical. Bluespotted flathead use this body structure to hide in sand (their body colour changes to match their background), with only their eyes visible. While it has not been observed, it is thought that like other flathead species, the bluespotted flathead uses this camouflage to ambush small prey species. The species can also be an active swimmer and will actively chase prey without resorting to ambush. The bluespotted flathead can be distinguished from other flathead by its scattered blue spots, elongated dark blotches on the tail which become larger from the top of tail to the bottom. The lower preopercular spine is distinctly longer than the upper. Bluespotted flathead are a commonly encountered on marine sands in south-eastern Australia and are rarely found in other habitats. They reach up to and 68 cm in length and it is thought that both males and females reach this maximum size. Fishing Both commercial and recreational fishers target bluespotted flathead. Often they are confused by fishers with the numerous other species of flathead caught in the same areas.

It can be made out of plastic, metal, and silicon fabricated tools. In 1994 they were mostly used in offices, but their popularity rose within the gaming industry, and they are mostly marketed to eSports players.  Functionality  The mouse bungee consists of a wide, stable base plate with non-slip bottom and a crane-like, oblique, sprung clamp for the cable, which rises about 10 cm high. In plastic frames a stabilisation weight is incorporated, which ensures the necessary weight. Ideally, it is in front of the Mouse and the cable length is manually set so that the entire mouse pad can be easily reached with the mouse, but does not create unnecessary loops in the cable. The back of the cable remains still on the table without causing an annoyance. Some of the models also feature a USB hub, which asks for an additional input cable from the computer, but offers several output options, like USB 2.0 and USB 3.0.  History  Although DIY cord holders were popular since the introduction of corded computer mice, the first dedicated product came from the company Mouse Bungee, represented by the CEO Ed Larkin. Back in 1994, he introduced a simple solution which offered a mouse cord holder and a mouse pad. Since the idea didn't flourish within the business world, the company sold the project to Razer Inc back in 2010. Later that year Razer introduced a revised version without a mouse pad, and the product ended up as the current market leader within the field of Gaming Mouse Bungees. At that point the trend was created and other companies started following it. Soon enough all the major manufacturers of computer peripherals joined the market with their solution, and today there are over 20 different products on the market.

Menéndez Bueyes, Margarita Prieto Prat, Manuel Carlos Jiménez González, (200), the Roman bridge of Salamanca in the chronicles, historical sources and historiography Salamanca: studies journal, , no. 44, pp. 193-220 The importance of the bridge as a symbol of the city can be seen in the first quartering of city's coat of arms (along with its stone bull- verraco). It has been known traditionally as puente mayor and as puente prinçipal (main bridge) which gives access to the southern part of the city. The bridge as it currently appears is a result of several restorations. One of the disasters that most affected it was the Flood of San Policarpo on the night of January 26, 1626.Ángel Vaca Lorenzo, (2011), El Puente Romano de Salamanca - Desde su construcción hasta la riada de Policarpo de 1626, It was declared Artistic Historic Monument on June 3, 1931,Gaceta de Madrid of 4 June of 1931, num. 155, p. 1184 and Bien de Interés Cultural since 1998. Until the beginning of 20th century it carried the main road into the city, and continued to bear heavy traffic until 1973. After the construction of a third bridge for road traffic it remains exclusive for pedestrians. The bridge is actually a construction of two bridges separated by a central fortification: the old bridge which extends along the portion near the city and is of Roman origin, and the new bridge. Of the twenty-six arches, only the first fifteen date from Roman times. The stone used in its construction differs in origin, while employed in Roman bridge area is originally from the granite quarries of Los Santos (Béjar), the stone used in the hispana part and more modern bridge, comes from the area of Ledesma. The bridge has been restored on numerous occasions and has survived several attempts at demolition. Many of the restorations have been poorly documented, leaving for the study of archaeologists a great part of the work of determination, dating and explaining the ancient construction techniques. The date of the construction of the bridge not is precisely known, but is among the mandates of the Emperors Augustus (27 B. C.-14 D. C.) and Vespasian (69-79), making it a bimillennium architectural monument.  History  The history of the bridge is connected to the city and is part of its most characteristic monuments along with the two cathedrals, the La Clerecía, Plaza Mayor, Casa de las Conchas. Formerly, there was a popular belief that the bridge was first built by Heracles and later was rebuilt by the Roman Emperor Trajan.Manuel Gonzalez de la Llana, (1869), General Chronicle of Spain: that is Illustrated and descriptive history of its provinces, its most important populate places, Province of Salamanca, Volume 2, Number 5 the basis for the theory that its builder was Trajan , reports Gil González Dávila in 1606, was a tombstone found at the time, but this actually refers to a repair of the Vía de la Plata. In 1767, a box was found in the first arcade and within it was a medal in honour Heracles; the Salamancan chronicler Bernardo Dorado realises this in his Compendio Histórico de la Ciudad de Salamanca. This reinforced the popular myth that has remained in popular sayings. Nevertheless, subsequent historical research mentions that the bridge was built in the second half of the 1st century. It was born from the need to provide a crossing of the Tormes River by travellers on the Vía de la Plata linking Mérida and Astorga (Iter ab Emerita Asturicam). =Origin= As early as the 13th century there was documented existence of the Verraco next to the bridge, and in 1606, the city's chronicler Gil González Dávila noted that the Salamanca's coat of arms had a stone bull in the first quartering. This coat of arms was used in the wax seals of council and clergy. Although the verraco date from the time of the Vettones, the construction of the bridge dates back to times of Roman rule over the area. The trajectory of the Iter ab Emerita Asturicam through Salamanca required the construction of a bridge near the city. Nevertheless, there is no documentary, epigraphic and archaeological evidence capable of accurately determining the precise timing of its construction.J. Mauluquer De Motes, (1956), Carta Arqueológica de España, Diputación Provincial de Salamanca, nº 181 Due to the constructive evolution of this stretch of Roman road (completed in all its sections in year 19 BC), it is possible that the bridge was built approximately during Nero's mandate. Other historians date it from the time of Trajan and Hadrian (the bridge's structure has similarities with the Aqueduct of Segovia).C. Morán Bardón, B. Oliver Román, (1949), The Roman road \\"La Plata\\" in the province of Salamanca, Ministry of Public Works, Madrid, pp. 27 These conclusions are based on epigraphic studies made to milestones in the road since the bridges do not provide reliable information from the archaeological point of view. The Vía de la Plata was completed in all sections in 19 BC. The descriptions made by Strabo (III, 4, 20) of the distribution of the Roman troops in Hispania, show that Roman deployment was enabled from Astorga, León to Lusitania. When Augustus made his second campaign in Hispania between 16 and 13 B.C., newly populated places began to appear along the roads, especially those engaged in the ore transport. This led to the need to build elements of public works to facilitate communication and transport. During the Flavian dynasty's period there was great activity in the northern Spain reflected in increased construction activity. At beginning of the first century, exploitation of the Las Cavenes's gold mines (in El Cabaco) began. This suggests that the bridge was built during Trajan's rule, a time of great municipalization of population centres. It is possible that the bridge did not originally consist only of stone but of a mixed construction with wood.Calderón, C., “Los puentes en la Castilla Bajomedieval”, en Cuadernos de Historia de España, 71 (1989), p. 40. After Roman times there are few data on the role of bridge in successive invasions of Suebis, Vandals and Alans, or during the lengthy Visigothic reign of Toledo. = Middle Ages to eighteenth century = It is possible that the bridge was subjected from the beginning to the flooding of Tormes River. This suggests that the primitive Roman bridge could have been longer than the current structure, the Hispanic part being a medieval reconstruction after a strong flood. The bridge was key in communication with the Leonese kingdom during the Reconquista. Nevertheless, it is not until the 12th century that documentary information of the existence of the bridge appears. Control of people and goods (in addition to collection of the portazgo tax) was carried out on the near side of Salamanca. One of the first major floods occurred in 1256, called Ríada de los Difuntos. This flooding and its effects on the bridge are documented and it seems that it left the southern part of the bridge impassable. It is unknown whether the new part of the bridge was built subsequently to this flood.

In the early-16th century, the Tormes was considered, like the Tagus, one of the most dangerous rivers in the Iberian Peninsula, due to its large floods.Á. Vaca Lorenzo, “La Tierra de Campos y sus bases ecológicas en el siglo XIV”, en Stvdia Historica. Historia Medieval, X, Salamanca, 1992, p. 170 In 1570, traveller and painter Anton van den Wyngaerde painted the bridge and city from the arrabal. In 1626, the Flood of San Policarpo occurred, causing much destruction in the city and the bridge's medieval section was heavily damaged in two of its arches. Gradually the other arches collapsed up to the Central tower; the Roman section remained undamaged. In 1627, major repairs occurred, being Corregidor of Salamanca Diego de Pareja Velarde, as can be seen today in the two pillars of the entrance to the arrabal. The central tower and the battlements were removed. Traveler Anton van den Wyngaerde portrays the city from the arrabal in 1570 where it can see the bridge with its central monument. = Bridge after the Flood of San Policarpo = The bridge's second repair occurred in 1767 to maintain the bridge its eleven modern and fifteen Roman arches. On 22 July 1812, during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic French, there was a battle south of the city (in the hills of Arapil Chico and Arapil Grande) called the Battle of Salamanca, known in Spanish as the Battle of the Arapiles (la batalla de los Arapiles).Miguel Alonso Baquer, (1995), La batalla de Salamanca o de los Arapiles, Militaria, Revista de Cultura Militar, nº7 . Servicio de Publicaciones UCM. Madrid Due to its strategic position, the bridge became a military target. The day before the battle, the Duke of Wellington took the bridge and the fords of Santa Marta and Aldea Luenga, and from here could direct the attack against the French troops.

Smart received widespread critical acclaim for her performance, winning the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie/Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. Character overview In March 1979, Floyd Gerhardt is the matriarch of The Gerhardt family, which is the most powerful organized crime syndicate in Fargo, North Dakota. Their power is threatened by two near- simultaneous incidents. A debilitating stroke leaves her husband, Otto in poor health, potentially jeopardizing the dynasty's leadership. Two of their sons, Dodd (Jeffrey Donovan) and Bear (Angus Sampson), begin competing for control. While they are figuring out who will lead the family, Floyd is put in charge. The Gerhardts are facing a serious challenge from a Kansas City crime syndicate, led by Joe Bulo (Brad Garrett), for control of the region. Meanwhile, Floyd's third son Rye (Kieran Culkin) has gone missing. Unbeknownst to Floyd and the rest of her family, he has been killed by Peggy Blumquist (Kirsten Dunst) in a hit and run after murdering a judge at a diner in Rock County, Minnesota. Joe Bulo of the Kansas City syndicate arrives at the Gerhardt residence, along with Mike Milligan (Bokeem Woodbine) and the two Kitchen brothers. Bulo offers Floyd a buyout of her family's operation but would allow them to run it. After he leaves, Floyd tells her sons, minus the missing Rye, about the meeting. Dodd bristles at his mother running the business, but she states that he can take over once the current situation settles. She then demands that Rye be found. Mike and the Kitchens also begin searching for Rye. Dodd and his henchman Hanzee (Zahn McClarnon), as well as Mike, each conduct an independent search for him. Dodd's daughter Simone tips off Hanzee about a lead on Rye, and they ambush Skip at Rye's apartment. They bring him to Dodd, who assaults Simone for acting independently. Mike and the Kitchens then eliminate Otto's guards in the parking lot outside the medical clinic, leaving Otto unharmed. Meanwhile, Floyd, Dodd, and Bear meet with Joe Bulo and propose a counter-offer to his buyout: a partnership. Bulo balks at the idea, since Dodd assaulted two of his men earlier. Bulo phones his superiors who reject the Gerhardts' proposal. They now offer two million dollars less than the first offer and demand the Gerhardts' complete surrender. At the Gerhardt farm, Floyd tells the family to prepare for war. Dodd and Hanzee concoct a story – about Ed Blumquist (Jesse Plemons) being a hitman called \\"The Butcher\\" who was hired by Kansas City to kill Rye – trying to rile Floyd into bloody action. She responds by having Hanzee and a team of Gerhardt assassins ambush Bulo during a hunting trip. In the resulting shootout, Hanzee kills a Kitchen brother as well as Bulo, and sends the latter's head to Mike. Mike threatens Dodd's daughter Simone (Rachel Keller) during their next dalliance, demanding that she spy on her family for him. Meanwhile, Dodd sends his henchman Virgil (Greg Bryk) to Luverne to kill Ed, and allows Bear's son, Charlie (Allan Dobrescu), to accompany him. Virgil and Charlie arrive in Luverne and botch an attempt to kill Ed. Virgil is killed, Charlie is hospitalized, Ed is arrested and the butcher shop is burned down. In Fargo, Floyd insists that \\"The Butcher\\" be executed, and Charlie retrieved from jail. Hours later, Dodd and accomplices arrive at the Blumquist home hunting Ed, while Bear heads to the police station to fetch Charlie. Hanzee knocks out Hank, but Peggy subdues Dodd in her basement using his stun rod. Meanwhile, Simone calls Mike Milligan and reveals the Gerhardts' plan that Dodd and Bear departed for Luverne. Fed up with her father's abuse, she wants Mike to murder Dodd. Mike and his men arrive at the thinly protected farmhouse and open fire with Simone, Floyd, and Otto inside. They succeed in killing Otto. Otto and some of Rye's belongings, including his belt buckle, are buried at the Gerhardt farm. Lou Solverson (Patrick Wilson) and Ben Schmidt (Keir O'Donnell) arrive after the funeral and take Floyd to the station for questioning. She eventually accepts a deal that will absolve her family members for previous crimes they have committed in exchange for information about how the Kansas City syndicate runs their drug operation. Dodd is later held hostage by Peggy and Ed after trying to attack them. Ed calls Mike and offers Dodd in exchange for getting the Gerhardts off their backs. After, Hanzee comes to kill the Blumquists and kills Dodd. He then asks Peggy for a haircut so he can be free of \\"this life\\". Before Peggy finishes, Lou arrives to arrest the Blumquists, and he escapes. After being arrested, Ed reveals his upcoming rendezvous with Mike to hand over now-dead Dodd Gerhardt to the cops at Sioux Falls. South Dakota State Police Captain Cheney hatches a dangerous scheme for Ed and Peggy to wear a wire for the meeting, hoping to implicate Milligan and the Kansas City mob. After Ed and Peggy agree to the plan in exchange for lesser criminal charges, the police set up an ambush at the motel meeting spot, only for Hanzee to observe their actions from a distance. Hanzee lies to Floyd and Bear by claiming Dodd is being held inside the motel by the Kansas City mob. When the Gerhadt family is about to invade the hotel and take back what they think is Dodd who is kidnapped by the Kansas City mob, Hanzee reveals his true intentions and stabs Floyd to death. Reception Smart received critical acclaim for her performance. For her performance in the episode \\"Fear and Trembling\\", TVLine named her their \\"Performer of the Week\\", writing: \\"In the opening weeks of the FX series’ second season, we saw hints of Floyd’s formidability as the Gerhardt crime family matriarch, newly thrust as she was into a position of leadership after husband Otto’s stroke. But it was when she sat down to present a “respectable” counteroffer to Kansas City, the syndicate fronted by Joe Bulo (played by Brad Garrett), that Smart took revelatory dialogue and crafted a compelling picture of one tough mother.\\" =Accolades= For her performance, Smart won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Movie/Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie.

The meeting house, built in 1795-96, is one of two extant meeting houses constructed of logs under the care of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. The other, the Catawissa Friends Meetinghouse is located about six miles north in Catawissa. History In 1786, the first meeting (similar to a congregation in other denominations) was established at Roaring Creek under the sponsorship of Exeter Monthly Meeting. In 1796, when the meeting house was built, the meeting became a preparative meeting, as part of the Catawissa Monthly Meeting, along with preparative meetings at Fishing Creek and Muncy. A decline in membership led the Catawissa Monthly Meeting to merge in 1814 with the Roaring Creek and Berwick meetings and relocate to the Roaring Creek Meeting House. Note: This includes Elias Hicks is believed to have spoken at the Roaring Creek meeting house. About 1827, after the \\"great separation\\" between Hicksite and Orthodox Quakers, the meeting house was used by the Hicksites. By 1916, meetings for worship were held only once a month so the meeting was “laid down” or closed. It is now owned by Locust Township. Quakers in the area meet at Millville. Architecture Though log meeting houses were commonly built by Pennsylvania Quakers during the early period of settlement, they were usually replaced quickly by stone, brick or frame construction. The meeting house is divided into two unequally sized meeting rooms, one for the men’s business meeting and worship, the other for the women’s business meeting. The rooms are divided by a retractable wood partition. The partition has sections of three wood panels. In each section the middle panel folds down allowing communication, and the top panel can be propped up to fully open the partition. A door in the middle of the partition provides access between the rooms. The meeting house has one story, measuring 30'-4\\" x 36'-5”, four bays by two bays. It is built of hewn logs, with chinking and corner boards. It has a rubble stone foundation, and a side-gable roof with wooden shingles. No chimneys are extant. Windows have six-over-six panes with batten shutters. The interior walls and ceiling are covered with wooden planks. Two rows of facing benches, where visiting ministers and senior members of the meeting would sit, are on a single raised tier. A simple set of stairs leading to the main doorway is the only exterior construction. A burying ground is walled off, north of the meeting house.

It was directed and choreographed by Graeme Murphy from a scenario by Murphy and Kristian Fredrikson, with dialogue by Linda Nagle and Paul Chubb. Music incorporated existing songs from Tivoli productions, original songs by Max Lambert and Linda Nagle, and an original musical score by Graeme Koehne.  Synopsis  Interweaving backstage scenes with onstage acts, the story opens in 1906, when the main character, a starry-eyed Jack, lands a job as a stagehand. This marks the beginning of a lifelong love affair with 'the Tiv' across periods of great social change for Australia – two World Wars, the roaring 20s and the Depression years, exotic revues of the 1950s and finally the advent of television.  Productions  Tivoli was first produced in 2001 as a co-production between the Sydney Dance Company and The Australian Ballet, touring Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra. A 2003 return season played at the Capitol Theatre in Sydney.  Recordings  There is no official cast recording, although a private recording exists. A symphonic version of Koehne's score, Tivoli Dances, was recorded by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra conducted by Richard Mills and released in 2008. A half-hour documentary, Tivoli: the making of a Dance Musical, produced and directed by Philippe Charluet was broadcast on the ABC.  Awards and nominations  Tivoli received four 2001 Australian Dance Awards, including Outstanding Performance by a Company, Outstanding Achievement in Choreography, Outstanding Performance by a Male Dancer (Harry Haythorne) and Outstanding Achievement in Commercial Dance, Musicals or Physical Theatre (Tracey Carrodus).

With the help of his brother, Leonard, Young operated the publication until March 15, 1934. At that time the paper was sold to Burette E. Slater of Westville, and having more modern facilities, the paper was then printed at Westville, while an office was still maintained in LaCrosse. In 1955, the Sentinel was merged with the Wanatah Mirror and the name of the newspaper was changed to The Regional News. On October 28, 1961, the LaCrosse office was moved to a new building located at 16 E. Main Street. The rear of the building was rented to the LaCrosse Public Library in December 1961. Four years later, the library purchased the entire building. In the early 2000s the newspaper was purchased by Galen Armstrong.

based in Brooklyn, New York, and the first ever to be established in the United States.  Background  = Decline of Bedford–Stuyvesant = In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, New York, was home to middle class German, Dutch, Italian, Irish, and Jewish immigrants and their descendants. In the 1920s, African-Americans migrating from the South settled in the area. Starting in 1930, people from Harlem moved into the neighborhood, seeking better housing. As the impoverished black population increased, banks reduced lending to local residents and businesses. By 1950, the number of blacks had risen to 155,000, comprising about 55 percent of the population of Bedford–Stuyvesant. Over the next decade, real estate agents and speculators employed blockbusting to make quick profits. As a result, formerly middle-class white homes were turned over to poorer black families. By 1960, eighty-five percent of the population was black. By the mid-1960s, 450,000 residents occupied the neighborhood’s nine square miles. Bedford–Stuyvesant had become Brooklyn’s most populous neighborhood and had the second largest concentration of African-Americans in the United States. Garbage pickup decreased and local schools deteriorated. The streets became dangerous as juvenile delinquency, gang activity, and heroin use increased. Around 80 percent of residents were high school dropouts and about 36 percent of children were born to unmarried mothers. Economic downturn was in part facilitated by the decline of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the closure of a Sheffield Farms milk-bottling plant on Fulton Street. Almost half of the housing was officially classified as \\"dilapidated and insufficient.\\" Rates of venereal disease were among the highest in the United States, while infant mortality was the highest. = 1964 riot and reaction = Confrontation between black rioters and police at Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue during the 1964 riot On July 16, 1964, an off-duty white police lieutenant, Thomas Gilligan, shot and killed a 15-year old black boy, James Powell. Two nights later, violence broke out in Harlem, and on the 20th of July rioting started at the intersection of Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue in Bedford–Stuyvesant. This carried on for three nights in the latter neighborhood and resulted in 276 arrests, 22 injuries, and 556 incidents of property damage which cost an estimated $350,000. The riot brought national attention to Bedford–Stuyvesant, but concern soon faded; after six months, the only improvement in the community was the paving of an empty lot. On November 21, the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council hosted an all-day conference at Pratt Institute in response to the summer riot. 600 local civic, religious, and political leaders discussed ways to improve the area. In the end it was decided that the Pratt Institute's Planning Department would conduct a six- month survey of local challenges and the potential for redevelopment. The study focused on a 12-block section of the community, finding much of the housing in the area at the point of decay. However, it was found that chances of rehabilitation in the area were \\"greatly enhanced\\" by the fact that 22.5 percent of buildings were owner occupied, 9.7 percent of buildings were owned by individuals that lived close by, and the average homeowner resided in the area for 15 years. The Planning Department's report concluded that New York City should \\"mobilize all necessary antipoverty and other social welfare and educational programs\\" to save the neighborhood from further decline. However, Youth-in-Action, the community's city anti-poverty agency, was only allocated $440,000 out of a requested $2.6 million budget for 1965, forcing it to cut many of its programs. = Robert F. Kennedy's involvement = Senator Robert F. Kennedy speaks with a boy during his tour of Bedford–Stuyvesant Late in 1965 Robert F. Kennedy, the junior senator of New York, decided to give an address on race and poverty. Disturbed by the Watts riots in Los Angeles, he was worried that America's racial crisis was shifting from the rural South to the urban North. He was also concerned that white support for black demands within the community was declining and that race relations were near to boiling over. Kennedy gave three consecutive speeches in Manhattan on January 20, 21, and 22, 1966. Most of the content was in line with John F. Kennedy's New Frontier programs, with proposals for job training, rent subsidies, students loans for the poor, and housing desegregation. He also broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society rhetorical optimism, arguing that the situation for black Americans was worsening instead of improving. He asserted that welfare and stricter code enforcement were not solving the problems facing ghettos and that community involvement and action from the private sector were necessary to effectively combat urban poverty. Kennedy warned that failure to act could lead to more race riots. Several days later, Kennedy decided to create his own anti-poverty program. He told speechwriter Adam Walinsky, \\"I want to do something about all this. Some kind of project that goes after some of these problems[...]see what you can put together.\\" In mid-February, Kennedy spent an afternoon touring Bedford–Stuyvesant. Afterwards, he attended a meeting with community activists at the local YMCA building. Similar in manner to the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting of 1964, Brooklyn community leaders were bitter towards the senator and lectured him on the problems black residents of the neighborhood faced. Civil Court Judge Thomas R. Jones said, \\"I'm weary of study, Senator. Weary of speeches, weary of promises that aren't kept[...]The Negro people are angry, Senator, and, judge that I am, I'm angry, too. No one is helping us.\\" Kennedy was irritated by the way he was treated. As he drove back to Manhattan he told his aides, \\"I could be smoking a cigar down in Palm Beach. I don't really have to take that. Why do I have to go out and get abused for a lot of things I haven't done?\\" Several moments later he said, \\"Maybe this would be a good place to try and make an effort.\\"  History  = Planning and design = Throughout the summer of 1966 Senator Kennedy's aides, Walinsky and Thomas Johnston, planned an anti-poverty program. As part of their research, they traveled across the country to consult black militants, urban theorists, federal administrators, journalists, mayors, foundation leaders, and banking and business executives. Johnston spent much of his time in Bedford–Stuyvesant trying to sort out differences between the community's middle-class leadership. Earl G. Graves, Sr., a former real-estate broker from the area, was brought in to assist him. Realizing that the Johnson administration and Brooklyn's white Democrats felt politically threatened by his project, Kennedy secured support from Mayor John Lindsay and the senior senator from New York, Jacob Javits, both Republicans. He also earned corporate support from Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM, William S. Paley of CBS, investment banker André Meyer, and former Secretary of Treasury C. Douglas Dillon. Only David Rockefeller declined to support the project. By October, Kennedy, his staff, and community leaders had resolved to launch a community development corporation for the near-entirety of the ghetto of Bedford–Stuyvesant. Kennedy later said, \\"An effort in one problem area is almost worthless. A program for housing, without simultaneous programs for jobs, education, welfare reform, health, and economic development cannot succeed. The whole community must be involved as a whole.\\" Initial plans included coordinated programs for the creation of jobs, housing renovation and rehabilitation, improved health sanitation, and recreation facilities, the construction of two \\"super blocks,\\" the conversion of the abandoned Sheffield Farms milk-bottling plant into a town hall and community center, a mortgage consortium to provide subsidized loans for homeowners, the founding of a private work-study community college for dropouts, and a public campaign to convince corporations to invest in industry in the neighborhood. A few days before the project was going to publicly unveiled, Kennedy said \\"I'm not at all sure this is going to work. But it's going to test some new ideas, some new ways of doing this, that are different from the government's. Even if we fail, we'll have learned something. But more important than that, something has to be done. People like myself can't go around making nice speeches all the time. We can't just keep raising expectations. We have to do some damn hard work, too.\\" = First founding = On December 9, 1966, Kennedy, together with Mayor Lindsay and Senator Javits, announced his anti-poverty program at New York Public School 305. He told the audience, \\"The program for the development of Bedford–Stuyvesant will combine the best of community action with the best of the private enterprise system. Neither by itself is enough, but in their combination lies our hope for the future.\\" The plan was met with mixed reactions in the press, with some liberals accusing the project of relying too heavily on the private sector while conservative elements were more hopeful of its chances for success. Initially, the responsibility of the revival of the neighborhood rested with two private, nonprofit corporations. The first, Bedford–Stuyvesant Renewal and Rehabilitation Corporation (R & R), consisted of 20 established civic and religious community leaders under the leadership of Judge Thomas R. Jones. Its purpose was to design anti-poverty programs and retain basic decision-making authority. The second, Distribution and Services (D & R) was to secure financial and logistical support for the former. It was run by an all-white board of businessmen that included Watson, Paley, Meyer, Dillon, David Lilienthal and Jacob Merrill Kaplan. Roswell Gilpatric, James Oates, and Benno C. Schmidt Sr. were later added. = Internal disputes and second founding = The community corporation's membership was almost entirely middle class and about one-third female. Many factions in Bedford–Stuyvesant felt underrepresented, resulting in bitter political infighting. In March 1967 Judge Jones reached an impasse with the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council. With the support of Kennedy and Lindsay, he demanded that the R & R board resolve to expand itself to include a wider array of community leaders and give him three weeks to revise the corporation's structure. The ultimatum lost by a single vote and Jones angrily resigned. The ensuing dispute threatened to derail the entire project. Kennedy tried to salvage it by dissolving the R & R and creating a new restoration corporation. Arguing that a more representative group was needed to secure federal and private grants, he won the support of Lindsay and Javits to proceed. On April 1, Jones announced the formation of the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation (BSRC). It was the first community development corporation in the United States. The new board included Sonny Carson, Albert Vann, and Milton Galamison. Franklin A. Thomas selected to be the first President and CEO of the new corporation. = Initial activities = The corporations received their first grants from the Stern Family Fund, J. M. Kaplan Fund, Ford Foundation and Astor Foundation. Seven months later they received a $7 million grant from the Department of Labor made possible by a 1966 amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 drafted by Kennedy and Javits to provide the private sector with incentive payments in exchange for investments in impoverished areas. In spite of a public awareness campaign and support from several prominent Republicans, the project only received modest support from private businesses. Investments from IBM, Xerox, and U.S. Gypsum notwithstanding, most corporate executives believed there was little profit in poorer communities and were concerned about hostile working environments. Most of the residents of Bedford–Stuyvesant were initially skeptical of the project's intentions. Planning occurred throughout the early months of 1967. By March, a strategy had been laid out for the physical reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bedford–Stuyvesant. It centered around a two-block-wide commercial zone to be located between Fulton Street and Atlantic Avenue which would serve as a principal point for local business and community organizations. Several lightly trafficked roads were chosen to be transformed into landscaped walkways. Architect I. M. Pei was commissioned for the establishment of the two \\"superblocks\\". Local residents believed the proposal was purely cosmetic and insisted that housing and employment programs be given greater attention. Pei was eventually able to convince more of the more corporation staff to support his plan. Meanwhile, members of the still- functional D & S board were working on areas of their expertise; Paley began exploring the development of communications infrastructure, George S. Moore focused on project financing and mortgage pooling, Schmidt assisted small businesses, Watson managed job training and employment programs, and Meyer worked on real estate problems and strategized for the corporation's overall funding. Wanting to earn the trust of the community, Thomas organized the \\"Community Home Improvement Program\\" (CHIP). With labor drawn from unemployed youth, various houses would be chosen by lottery to have their exteriors refurbished. In turn, homeowners would provide a token payment of $25 (for work valued at $325). The corporation would continue to maintain the houses after rehabilitation. Though seen by Judge Jones as \\"superficial\\", the program went into effect with a $500,000 federal grant and quickly became popular. The D & S board gradually began to lose its supremacy over the BSRC. Thomas lobbied for an end of D & S control over funding and created a joint account to be managed by both corporations. In December 1967 Kennedy brought in John Doar to be the new executive director of the D & S board. One of his first actions was to relocate the businessmen corporation's staff into the BSRC's offices. It was seen by community leaders as a hindrance and eventually dissolved. The BSRC also produced a television series about the neighborhood, Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant, which premiered in April 1968. By December, the Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation had restored 400 brownstones and tenements with the help of 272 local residents, 250 of whom were later hired in full-time construction jobs. Two \\"Neighborhood Restoration Centers\\" for free advice and legal consultation had been opened, 14 new black-owned businesses had been established, and 1,200 residents had received vocational training. IBM located a computer cable plant in the neighborhood, creating 300 new jobs, while the City University of New York had agreed to coordinate with community leaders for the construction of a new community college in the area. A mortgage pool fund run by a consortium of 65 banks loaned $1.5 million to homeowners. Still, progress was slow and journalist Jack Newfield estimated that of Bedford–Stuyvesant's 450,000 inhabitants, only about 25,000 had been affected by the corporation's work. In 1968 the BSRC purchased the abandoned milk-bottling plant on Fulton street for rehabilitation. Its restoration was completed in 1972 and it became the new corporate headquarters for the BSRC, entitled Restoration Plaza. In 1979, Pathmark opened the first supermarket in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the plaza. = 21st century = As of 2010, Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation had constructed or rehabilitated 2200 housing units in the neighborhood, provided mortgage financing to nearly 1500 homeowners, brought $375 million in investments to the community, and created over 20,000 jobs. Restoration Plaza currently serves as an office and mall complex for the surrounding area and as the unofficial downtown of Bedford–Stuyvesant. In addition to housing utilities services and a post office, the building hosts the BSRC's Center for Arts and Culture. This includes the Billie Holiday Theatre, Restoration Dance Theater, and the Skylight Art Gallery. The Youth Arts Academy, Under One Sun, and Phat Tuesday programs are also run from the plaza.

It was written by James Kerwin and Vic Mignogna from a story by Vic Mignogna and directed by James Kerwin. Fairest of Them All is a direct continuation of the original Star Trek episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". In 2014, \\"Fairest of Them All\\" won the Burbank International Film Festival award for Best New Media in Drama. Plot summary The story begins with a recreation of the last few minutes of the original episode. In the mirror universe, \\"our\\" Kirk urges mirror universe-Spock to take command of the ISS Enterprise, spare the Halkans and find a way to make peace to prevent the Terran Empire from collapsing. He and his landing party are then transported back to the Federation \\"prime\\" universe, while their \\"evil\\" counterparts return in the alternate reality. The evil Kirk, now in command again, is determined to either take the dilithium crystals from the Halkans or to destroy them as a show of force. When the Halkans refuse to hand over the crystals, Kirk orders a photon torpedo barrage on their planet, rejecting a diplomatic solution recommended by Spock. The pitiless attack not only wipes out the Halkans but also destroys the crystals. Spock points out that the loss of the crystals would not have happened if the Captain had followed his advice. Facing this unexpectedly strong criticism by his first officer, a visibly nervous Kirk leaves the bridge and reaches his quarters. Meanwhile, three Andorian vessels have witnessed the attack on the Halkans and have communicated to the Enterprise that they will no longer recognize the authority of the Terran Empire, formalizing the start of a revolution. Spock informs Kirk of the Andorian ships' approach, but when Kirk orders him to destroy them if they try any aggressive moves, Spock refuses to comply. Kirk reacts to this act of insubordination by activating the Tantalus Field, a deadly device concealed in his quarters, to kill Spock. Unexpectedly, the machine does not seem to work. Kirk then calls his private guards and they head to the bridge to arrest Spock. Spock, in the meantime, has left the bridge and has convinced Scotty to join the now explicit mutiny. They take possession of the auxiliary control room, from where they have full control of the navigation of the ship. Other crew members, sent by Kirk to eliminate Spock, are attracted to the peaceful philosophy promoted by the Vulcan and join the mutiny as well. Marlena reveals to Spock that she disabled the Tantalus Field when Kirk tried to kill him. She suggests that Spock use it to eliminate Kirk. Spock declines, replying that no revolution can succeed using the same methods applied by the previous regime. The more time passes, the more Kirk is abandoned by his crew and feels helpless, to the point that he asks Spock to meet at the officer's lounge to discuss a potential compromise. Spock accepts the invitation, well aware that the meeting could hide a trap. When the two men face each other, Kirk tries to shoot Spock, but the Vulcan reveals that all the weapons have been disabled by a dampening field. Kirk, enraged at the failure of the attempt, attacks Spock and during a pause in the fight shouts his thoughts about the crew, stating that they are just expendable pawns to reach his goals. Unbeknownst to him, his statements are being broadcast to the entire ship by Spock, showing the crew the real nature of their leader. Two guards then enter the officer's lounge and, to Kirk's surprise, arrest and finally neutralize him. Spock gives a shuttlecraft to Kirk and the few crew members still loyal to him, so that they can reach the nearest habitable system. Spock states that he's aware that the entire Terran fleet will try to stop the Enterprise and his attempts to build a peaceful Empire, but that he must try. In the last scene, Spock takes command of the bridge as Captain and gives the navigator the order to move \\"forward\\". Production and release Fairest of Them All was one of the episodes of the series funded through a successful Kickstarter campaign held from October 7 to November 6, 2013. As with every episode of Star Trek Continues, the shooting of the Enterprise scenes took place in Kingsland, Georgia, at the facility owned by Farragut Films and their partners. According to the end credits of the episode, a scene was shot on location at NASA's Space Center Houston, home of the restored life-size prop of the original Star Trek Galileo shuttlecraft. Principal photography began in March 2014 and the shooting was completed in May 2014. According to director James Kerwin, one of the biggest production challenges for this episode was to create the alternate universe costumes for many cast members, which had to match as close as possible those worn in the \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" episode. Guest cast for this episode included: *Asia DeMarcos as Marlena Moreau *Kipleigh Brown as Smith (Brown previously appeared as Jane Taylor in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"The Forgotten\\") *Bobby Clark as Council Leader Tharn (Clark previously played the Gorn Captain in The Original Series episode \\"Arena\\", as well as portraying Chekov's guard in \\"Mirror, Mirror\\") *Bobby Quinn Rice as Crewman (Rice previously portrayed Lieutenant Ro Nevin in the online series Star Trek: Hidden Frontier, and Ensign Peter Kirk in the fan series Star Trek: Phase II, plus others) *Michael Dorn as the computer of the ISS Enterprise (Dorn played Worf in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and 5 Star Trek feature films) On June 4, 2014, TrekMovie.com published exclusive photos of the cast, announcing also the date of the release of the episode. The episode was premiered at Supanova 2014 in Sydney, Australia, on June 15, 2014 and was at the same time released on the official Star Trek Continues YouTube and Vimeo channels. Reception The reviews of Fairest of Them All have been very positive. Bill Watters of TrekMovie.com pointed out how the episode resembled one of those of TOS, writing: \\"Star Trek Continues does deserve the 'Continues' in its title as they do a really strong job at capturing (and yes, 'continuing') the atmosphere of TOS.\\" and author John Birmingham shared a similar sentiment, stating: \\"As storytelling goes, it is fast paced, entertaining and captures that essence of the original series. In that regard, I'd give this episode a strong thumbs up.\\" Wired has dedicated to Fairest of Them All a video of their video series Obsessed, that aims to highlight \\"what happens when people live out their obsessions to the fullest.\\" In the video, Mignogna and other people of the staff are interviewed and explain to what extent they have paid attention to detail to recreate the same visual style of the original Star Trek episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". The production values of the episode were highlighted, among others, by Sam Sloan of Slice of SciFi, who wrote: \\"Vic Mignogna and the cast and crew of Star Trek Continues have proven, once again with this episode of the ongoing voyage of the original Star Trek that this rendering of the show is on par with that original series and continues to amaze those who are watching it.\\" and by Josh Edelglass of MotionPicturesComics.com, who stated: \\"Even more impressive for this episode, the production team has exactingly recreated the look of the Mirror Universe sets and costumes.\\" More than one reviewer praised the performance of Todd Haberkorn. Clive Burrell wrote on Some kind of Star Trek: \\"Todd Haberkorn is excellent as Spock, charting quite a change in the Mirror universe version of the character from cold, calculating officer to peacemaker in 40 minutes\\" and Josh Edelglass wrote: \\"Todd Haberkorn gets a real showcase as Mr. Spock in this episode, and he's great. He's a little stiff in that opening scene in the transporter room, but after that I think he turns in a stellar performance.\\" Both Slice of SciFi and Some Kind of Star Trek commented also on the strong resemblance between Asia DeMarcos and BarBara Luna, the actress who portrayed the character Marlena Moreau in \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". In September 2014 Fairest of Them All won the award for Best New Media - Drama at Burbank International Film Festival.

Life =Early years= Johannes Daniel Jakob Kriege was born in Lüdinghausen, a midsized town then in Prussia's Province of Westphalia, located between Münster to its northeast and Dortmund to its south. Starting in 1877 he studied jurisprudence at Göttingen and Strasburg, passing his stage one state law exams and obtaining a post in the Prussian legal service as a court clerk in 1880, and receiving his doctorate of law in 1881. 1881 was also the year in which he passed his second level state law exams. He entered the Prussian diplomatic service in 1886. =Diplomat= In 1887 he received his first diplomatic posting, appointed German acting Vice- consul in Amsterdam, which may have been when he first got to know Pieter Cort van der Linden. Van der Linden later became the wartime Dutch prime minister, at which point Kriege would describe him as a personal friend of long standing. Kriege's next appointment, between 1889 and 1894, was as consul in Asunción, where his son Walter was born. He returned to Europe in 1896, taking up the same function in Sarajevo. During the years that followed he held an increasingly senior succession of legal posts in the foreign ministry. In 1900 he was appointed to the Privy Legation Council (Legationsrat). During the early years of the twentieth century Kriege participated in several of the important conferences that reflected growing international tensions across Europe. He attended the Second Hague Peace Conference, and was a permanent member of the Hague court between 1906 and his death. In 1908/09 he represented Germany at the London Law of the Sea conference. Between September 1911 and November 1918 Johannes Kriege served as head undersecretary (Ministerialdirektor) at the legal department of the foreign ministry. In 1916 he joined the privy council. On 31 January 1917 he held a secret meeting in Amsterdam with his old friend Pieter Cort van der Linden, by now the Dutch prime minister, in which he explained the background to the - at this stage still secret - decision by the German government to resume its controversial submarine campaign against the British and their allies. The Dutch government were assured that the German side continued to value good commercial relations with the Netherlands, but they were also warned of the dire consequences, were they to succumb to Anglo-American pressure to enter the war against Germany. The Dutch remained neutral in the war, even after February 1917 when diplomatic relations reached a new low point after German submarines sank seven Dutch ships (presumably engaged in commerce involving British ports). The Dutch delayed handing over two German submarines that had been badly damaged, but not sunk, in Dutch waters. Diplomatic waters were calmed by a further meeting between Kriege and van der Linden. Before and during the First World War he continued to be a member of German delegations at international conferences, notably in 1918 when he was the senior German government mandate holder in the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which formally excluded Russia from participation in the alliance against Germany. War ended in defeat for Germany which was followed by a year of revolution. Kriege went into temporary retirement. He was formally retired from the diplomatic service only in 1924, however. One result of military defeat and the ensuring revolution was that the German Emperor (Kaiser) was abdicated and sent into exile at Doorn, a short drive to the west of Utrecht. During this period Kriege made frequent visits to Doorn where he served as legal advisor to the ex-emperor. =Parliamentarian= In republican Germany, between 1921 and 1932 Johannes Kriege sat as a member of the Prussian regional legislature (Landtag), where he represented the conservative National People's Party (\\"Deutschnationale Volkspartei\\" / DNVP). Family Johannes Kriege came from a large well connected family. His eldest son, Walter Kriege (1891-1952), also became a top government lawyer who played a political role during the early years of the German Federal Republic. As a result of Walter's marriage, Johannes Kriege became the brother-in-law of the architect Richard Saran and the grandfather of the political journalist Mary Saran. He was also a nephew to the high profile theologian-pastor (1836-1910) and a grandson to the Bremen city mayor, (1804-1871). A cousin was the early socialist Hermann Kriege (1820-1850).

Background A low pressure area which barely entered the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR), which at one point was north of Batanes and exited the country by August 14, as well as tropical depression located in the Pacific Ocean outside the PAR enhanced the southwest monsoon. Impact In August 14, 2016, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported that about 70,000 people or 15,665 families were affected by the enhanced monsoon rains in the regions of Central Luzon (Region 3), Calabarzon (Region 4-A), Mimaropa (Region 4-B), Western Visayas (Region 6), Negros Island Region, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and the National Capital Region (NCR). Occasional rains were also experienced by residents in areas situated in the rest of Luzon and Visayas. The most affected provinces were reportedly Bataan, Bulacan, and Zambales. The enhanced monsoon caused a tornado to spawn in Manila's port area causing damages. At five were reported dead from the floods. Response The Department of Social Welfare and Development has opened at least 79 evacuation centers across the island of Luzon. In Marikina, Metro Manila, where the Marikina River overflowed due to enhanced monsoon rains, 21 evacuation centers were set up where at least 9,152 people were housed. Maynilad which serves significant portions of Metro Manila has reduced its water production due to sedimentation of raw water at the La Mesa watershed due to the monsoon rains causing soil erosion in the Angat watershed.

The early access version of the game was released on 30 July 2015 to Steam.  Gameplay  Call to Arms is a real-time tactics and strategy video game. The latest update for Call to Arms offers a brand new innovative mix of real-time strategy and 3rd, as well as 1st person direct control and other new features compared to the early access version. Set in the time of modern warfare, the game offers realistically modeled vehicles and heavy weaponry, as well as dozens of firearms. Not only can you defeat your enemies as a commander, but also by taking over any of your individual soldiers and vehicles (land, air and sea vehicles). You can control them in 3rd person view, as well as first person. This game also have a map editor to make new maps and scenarios and steam workshop option as well to share or download mods and add-ons from other users. \\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/302670/Call_to_Arms/?curator_clanid=1560170\\" The Domination game mode requires each team to take strategic points on a map, with the number of points decided by the number of players. The first team to take the greater number of points wins the round. The game provides bots possessing artificial intelligence in multiplayer mode. The game provides 12 vehicles and 60 pieces of equipment.  Development  = Design = Video game developer Digitalmindsoft announced Call to Arms on their website in December 2012, calling it the \\"true successor\\" to the Men of War series. The developer saw an opportunity to develop a real-time strategy video game set in the modern day, especially with the gameplay common to the Men of War series. The developer planned for two playable factions and an assortment of other features for when the game was released, and planned to extend the game through additional units, factions, and maps thereafter. Digitalmindsoft planned their factions to be asymmetric, fun-to-play, and fair. The factions are based on modern factions. Digitalmindsoft also planned to allow the player to control a unit's specific actions in a third-person view, similar to Men of War: Assault Squad, as well as allow players to build their own mods for the game. For the single-player mode, Digitalmindsoft wanted to implement what the players wanted, though they were aware that they were limited by their crowdfunding campaign. Digitalmindsoft said there would be a focus on the infantry-level interaction rather than an interaction with heavy weaponry such as tanks and airplanes, but that heavy weaponry would be playable. Although Digitalmindsoft had improved on the series's gameplay mechanics in Assault Squad, the company wanted to continue to focus on ease-of-gameplay improvements in Call to Arms. Chris Kramer, managing director of Digitalmindsoft, noted that there was a balance between making the game realistic and between making the game well-balanced and easy to play, as well as a balance between freedom-of-choice and game balance. He later made the point that the two games would play differently because they were set in two different periods of time, owing to the change in warfare. When asked about the quality of Men of War series co-developer 1C Company's games Men of War: Vietnam and Men of War: Condemned Heroes, Kramer said it was more important to self-improve than to critique 1C's games. Kramer also said that Digitalmindsoft was designing a new cooperative system relative to Assault Squad. Lace Mamba Global was announced as the publisher in December 2012. In early 2015, PC Gamer reported that the publisher would be the developer, Digitalmindsoft. Players who purchased the deluxe edition could beta test the unfinished campaigns. In the multiplayer mode, Digitalmindsoft wanted to integrate the personnel units first and then later the vehicles. = Game engine = In January 2013, Digitalmindsoft released a video of the game physics, which Rock, Paper, Shotgun (') said \\"[showed] a game that looks a lot like Men Of War with better voice acting\\". In an interview published shortly after, Kramer said that the game would make use of an updated GEM game engine to allow for better game performance. In February 2013, after another routine release of game screenshots and a video, RPS agreed with their earlier statement about the appearance of the game. In June 2013, Kramer thought that the engine should get a new name, because he found it \\"hard to believe the difference with all the improvements.\\" RPS agreed, with journalist Jim Rossignol suggesting that he would \\"be in heaven [...] if someone could create a sci-fi game with the same sort of engine fidelity.\\" Men of War: Assault Squad 2, released in May 2014 before Call to Arms, was also built using the Call to Arms engine, which PC Gamer identified as an opportunity to test the engine. In June 2013, Digitalmindsoft wanted to include \\"integrated in-game video capture software\\", and support for Steam was assumed. The game has a map and mission editor, which support Steam Workshop. The game also provides a replay function. = Crowdfunding and schedule = While Digitalmindsoft was funded to begin the project, the company sought crowdfunding as an extra source of revenue, offering better game performance and content as well as a list of rewards for stretch goals such as \\"skill-based matchmaking and support for Steam Workshop and Steam Cloud\\". Kickstarter was not available in mainland Europe in 2012, so Digitalmindsoft crowdfunded the game through their website. The company sought ; within a day, the project had and 80 backers. ShackNews and PC Gamer expressed reservations regarding crowdfunding, qualifying them due to the company's experience in this genre of video gaming and the fan base for the Men of War series. The developer expected to release the game in 2014. RPS attributed slow crowdfunding in January 2013 to a \\"remarkable lack of assets\\". When they spoke with Kramer later that month, he said that the company wanted to improve the game quality prior to starting a Kickstarter campaign, which would have heightened the game's profile before they were ready. RPS thought that it was likely that people were waiting for the game to have the quality of Assault Squad prior to funding the game. In March 2013, Wargamer reported that project had been crowdfunded for €5.5 thousand with less than a week left in the campaign, though they were informed by Digitalmindsoft that this wasn't the final goal. In July 2013, Digitalmindsoft announced Men of War: Assault Squad 2 with a release date of Q4 2013, leaving both RPS and ShackNews confused about the status of Call to Arms. ShackNews noted that the crowdfunding had fallen \\"far short of its goal\\". In May 2014, PC Gamer was also skeptical about the crowdfunding, as Digitalmindsoft had raised only 25% of the funds the developer expected. PC Gamer was optimistic regarding the schedule and that the publication of Assault Squad 2 \\"[would] help matters financially (if it sells well), even though the [developers had] denied that Assault Squad was made in order to fund Call to Arms.\\" In October 2014, Digitalmindsoft announced the game's Steam page and the forthcoming end of the crowdfunding campaign on their website. Blue's News and GameStar speculated that the game would release when the campaign ended. Blue's News also reported that the release of the game would include backer DLC, while GameStar believed that the game would see full release in 2015, though Digitalmindsoft had not provided a specific release date. Digitalmindsoft announced in late June 2015 that the game would be released to Steam early access in late July or August. Digitalmindsoft also announced a standard and deluxe edition, \\"Domination\\" game mode, play with bots, and a map and mission editor. They also stated that all users who purchased the early access version would have access to the campaigns at release for free. On 24 July, Digitalmindsoft confirmed that the game would be released to early access on 30 July. It would include all infantry units, some multiplayer maps, and multiplayer bots, and the replay function. Digitalmindsoft also said they would include additional maps, game modes and vehicles after release. Both GameStar and Blue's News believed that the game would be in early access until 2016 Q1.

History Before the Phylloxera epidemic, Chatus was grown primarily in the sandy soils of Bas-Vivarais, though scattered plantings could also be found in Drôme and Isère. The vines were traditionally grown on meter-high terraces, each supporting autin-trained vines. This form of training was very labor- intensive, often taking three to four times as much work as other vines to maintain. The wines created from Chatus were sought after in their own right, but they were also often boiled in order to sell to locals, a process which improved the color while damaging the flavor of the wine. In 1880, the Phylloxera epidemic destroyed most of the vineyards in the area, and Chatus was largely replaced with more manageable, well-known wines. What little vines remained were grafted on to American root stocks and Jacquez, and maintained until experimental wine making and replanting efforts were launched in 1989 and 1991, respectively. While the wine is still little-known outside of Ardèche, an ONIVINS request for reclassification was obtained in 1997, and in 2000 growers set a limit of 50 hectolitres per hectare in the Cévennes, which were replanted with the variety. Distribution and wines Chatus is presently grown exclusively in the area surrounding Ardèche. The grape can produce wines with brilliant color and complex aromas of medlar and overripe fruit. Wines made from Chatus tend to be intense and tannic when young, and were historically blended with Courbès, a now extinct native Ardèche varietal, to add acidity and alcohol. It is recommended to be aged five years before drinking. Vine and viticulture The vine is upright, vigorous, and prefers high altitudes and siliceous soils, especially the detrital ridges south of the Massif Central. Its susceptibility to diseases increases when grown on calcareous soils, especially mildew and powdery mildew. It ripens in mid- October. The clusters are compact, large, elongated and conical, without wings, though sometimes with a secondary cluster. The berries are round, uniform, small, and deep black with bluish bloom. Their pulp is green, tart, and sweet with no distinctive smell.

He was married in his adulthood to a wife who disapproved of his generous nature to the poor before her conversion and death and he spent his initial widowhood going on several pilgrimages to Rome as well as visits to both Spain and Jerusalem. He was beatified in 1748 after Pope Benedict XIV confirmed that there existed a longstanding local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - to the late farmer. Life Alberto da Bergamo was born in Bergamo in 1214 to modest and pious farmers. From aged seven he began fasting for half a week and foregone all the food he did not have during that time to the poor. He maintained his father's farm in Villa d'Ogna after following his father's pious and industrious example and he later married. His father had also taught him penitential practices that later fructified in his son's life. Alberto's wife made no initial objections to his generous example and his giving to the poor but the death of her father-in-law saw her begin to criticize his work. She soon ceased her nagging and in a sudden conversion began to follow his example though she later died not long after - the couple were childless. His parents and wife died sometime between 1240 and 1255. He gained a formidable reputation as one who dedicated his life to aiding the poor in whatever manner was available. He travelled on nine pilgrimages to Rome and also made eight visits to Santiago de Compostela and one to Jerusalem. While in Rome he manifested his obedience to the pontiffs of the times that he visited such as Pope Celestine IV and Pope Alexander IV. He would also visit the hospitals of Rome to comfort the ill and to encourage them to confess their sins. The farmer later settled in Cremona in order to continue his farming and arrived there at harvest time working in the fields with the moniker of \\"the diligent worker\\". Alberto worked twice as harder as was expected of a man and received twice as much in wages as a result of this. Jealous companions also sought to curb this with planting iron in his fields so that he would damage his tools though this failed. He often liked to walk along chanting Psalms; he also often recited the Divine Office. He became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in 1256 after meeting them at that time. He helped to aid the priests of the order in Cremona and volunteered to work in their garden. In 1279 he fell ill and sent a neighbor for a priest but a long period followed in which the neighbor failed to return with a priest. The stories suggest that a dove came to him bringing the Viaticum. It was also said after his death the bells of Cremona rang on their own. The people decided to inter him in a simple plot but no spade could break the ground so he was interred in the church of Saint Matthias where the late farmer often visited. Beatification Painting from the c. 1700s. The farmer's beatification received official confirmation from Pope Benedict XIV - on 9 May 1748 - after the pontiff confirmed that there was an enduring local 'cultus' - or popular devotion and longstanding veneration.

The episode was written by Sean Calder, and was directed by Steven DePaul. Plot Opening quote: \\"More and more she grew to love human beings and wished that she could leave the sea and live among them.\\" A group of teenagers, Jake Barnes (Michael Welch), Dan (Pritesh Shah), and Sarah (Sara Fletcher) and Anna Mahario (Lauren Luiz) are relaxing on a river. Sarah then finds that her sister, Elly (Stephanie Nogueras), who is in love with Jake, is spying on them and sends her off. Then, Dan is dragged in the river by a mysterious creature while Jake tries to help him. Elly manages to save Jake with a Wesen form but Dan drowns. Nick (David Giuntoli) and Hank (Russell Hornsby) are notified by the sheriff that Dan's body was found and had claw marks, deducing he was dragged. While inspecting the zone where the murder happened, Nick finds Elly and chases her but she jumps in the sea and swims quickly. Renard (Sasha Roiz) is told by Sebastien (Christian Lagadec) that Adalind (Claire Coffee) was dealing with Frau Pech about the baby, which may have royal blood. Nick and Hank go with Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) and Rosalee (Bree Turner), who just moved on the house. Rosalee thinks that the Wesen may be a Naiad, a mermaid-like Wesen. Tracking a signal from Jake's phone to a marina, Nick, Hank, Wu (Reggie Lee) and cops arrive at a boat owned by Abel (Brian McNamara), and find the phone in the house. Elly hides in the water as Sarah and Anna arrive, pretending that nothing happened. They arrest Sarah and Anna and after they leave, Abel confronts the neighbors Dominic (Derek Ray) and Jesse (Coltron James) as they are the real culprits. Dominic and Jesse decide to \\"cut\\" Elly and leave. Unwilling to let his daughters go to jail, Abel confesses the murder of Dan. Although they know he's innocent, Nick and Hank use the confession to make Sarah and Anna reveal that Dominic and Jesse are the killers, as their old tradition would require them to take care of their children. Meanwhile, Jake returns to his apartment to find Elly, recognizing her as the woman who saved him. She then takes him to a pool and shows her swimming abilities to find and even when she's different, Jake is surprised. Just then, Dominic and Jesse knock him out and kidnap Elly. Dominic and Jesse take Elly to the docks where they tie her to an anchor and throw her to the water. The cops arrive and using his PTZD abilities, Nick swims to the sea to rescue Elly while Hank holds off Dominic and Jesse. After saving Elly, Hank remarks to Nick that he spend a long time in the sea as his skin is pale. Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch) checks an e-mail sent to Nick from a known \\"M\\". In the station, Jake identifies Dominic and tells Nick and Hank that Elly is not human and that sounds crazy. They tell him everything is crazy in Portland. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 5.81 million people, earning a 1.6/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking third on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Hawaii Five-0, Shark Tank, and Undercover Boss. This was a 19% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.88 million viewers with a 1.3/4. This means that 1.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With DVR factoring in, the episode was watched by 8.49 million viewers with a 2.6 ratings share in the 18-49 demographics.Live+7 DVR Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Tops Adults 18-49 Ratings Increase, 'Elementary' Leads Percentage Gains, 'The Blacklist' Tops Viewer Increases in Week 8 =Critical reviews= \\"One Night Stand\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"Though Grimm stumbles in broad strokes, occasionally it manages to win me over with a surprising attention to detail. The featured Wesen tonight is the Naiad, based on the water nymph of Greek myth—though the epigraph comes from Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Little Mermaid.' In Grimms version of this creature, the males are sterile, and the women must mate in the water with other men in order to further the species of half-human Wesen. In essence, the men must care for children they cannot sire themselves. Putting aside the emasculating rage that inspires in the episode's villains, it took me a full 45 minutes to notice that the three Naiad daughters in the episode looked nothing alike: Sarah, a blonde, Anna a redhead, and Elly, a deaf brunette. That depth of backstory without calling direct attention is impressive, and touches like that make 'One Night Stand' an enjoyable episode in spite of some repetitive flaws.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.2 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"There are some episodes of Grimm that tell so much procedural story it sometimes grows boring rather than compelling. Grimm Season 3 Episode 4 focused on a captivating tale with some very exciting serial elements layered throughout.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"The third season of any TV series can often end up being the sweet spot; by that point, a show usually knows what it is, and what it wants to be. It's comfortable, but it's not old, tired, or overdone. There's still a lot to be explored. There are still new ideas to put to paper. Grimm is growing increasingly secure with embracing complicated and difficult ideas that go beyond a TV show. Real communities all over the world struggle with issues of identity, with balancing the needs and wants of a community versus the needs and wants of individuals. Assimilation can be a dirty word, but so can isolation.\\" References External links  Grimm (season 3) episodes 2013 American television episodes ","title":"One Night Stand (Grimm)"},{"id":"51330154","text":"Lilia Fisikovici (born 29 March 1989) is a Moldovan long distance runner who specialises in the marathon.

On 23 November he was appointed commander of the 2nd Rifle Division, the dismounted 2nd Cavalry Division.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p 40. Note that Forczyk states that the division was formed based on remnants of 2nd Cavalry Division. Sharp states that 2nd Cavalry was almost entirely dismounted on arrival in Crimea, and was renamed 2nd Rifle on Nov. 25, 1941; Sharp, \\"Red Sabers\\", Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. V, 1995, p 38. He fought in the Siege of Sevastopol. Novikov's division defended the 1st Sector of Sevastopol's defense on the Balaklava axis from 9 November 1941. Novikov became the sector commander. In January 1942 the division became the 109th Rifle Division. On 1 June the division withdrew back to Cape Kherson after the final German offensive, holding positions between Streletskaya Bay and Firsovo Farm. After the evacuation of Filipp Oktyabrsky and Ivan Yefimovich Petrov Novikov was appointed commander of the Sevastopol Defense Region by Petrov. On 2 July he left Sevastopol with other officers in subchaser SKA-112 and was intercepted by S-boats off Yalta. The subchaser was sunk after a running battle with the German boats and Novikov was captured. He was transferred to the Hammelburg camp. In December 1942, Novikov was transferred to the Flossenbürg concentration camp. He was killed by camp guards in August 1944. According to postwar testimony by Lieutenant Colonel Kalanchuk, Novikov died when he was hit with a stool by a camp guard near the furnace of Flossenbürg's 5th Block. Generals Ivan Muzychenko and Ivan Skugarev testified that Novikov died of overwork and exhaustion.

His contributions to radiology included the introduction of a positioning device that accurately displayed the round nature of the ribs on an X-ray image. He served as vice president of the American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS). Kassabian's first published paper was related to the side effects of radiation, and because of his frequent exposure to high doses of radiation, Kassabian himself was a victim of these effects. He sustained burns to his hand, had two fingers amputated, and developed a lethal case of skin cancer in his thirties. Early life Kassabian was born in Kayseri in the Cappadocia region of Asia Minor. He attended the American Missionary Institute there. He went to London to study theology and medicine with the initial goal of becoming a missionary. In London, he also developed a personal interest in photography. He moved to the United States and entered the Medico-Chirurgical College of Philadelphia. After taking a hiatus from his studies to serve in the Spanish–American War, Kassabian returned to Philadelphia and completed medical school. Career After graduating from medical school, Kassabian worked as an instructor at the Medico-Chirurgical College. In 1902, he resigned from that position and took over as director of the Roentgen Ray Laboratory at Philadelphia General Hospital. Under Kassabian's predecessor, George E. Pfahler, the two-year-old X-ray laboratory at Philadelphia General had recently made the second-ever X-ray diagnosis of a brain tumor. Combining his interests in electrotherapy, photography and the use of X-rays, Kassabian was able to establish radiology as a clinical entity worthy of its own department. He served as a delegate of the American Medical Association at international conferences, and he was a vice president of the American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS). Kassabian invented a positioning device for chest X-rays that showed the body's rotundity; previously, X-ray images had rendered the ribs as flat. He wrote a textbook, Electro-therapeutics and Roentgen Rays, which was widely employed in American medical schools. Kassabian studied the feasibility of imaging infants' hearts with X-rays and a contrast agent, bismuth subnitrate. He reported on this work in 1907, but due to the difficulty of controlling contrast agents and the rapid beating of the heart, his procedure did not become a standard medical practice. As an expert witness in court, Kassabian worked to establish the value of X-rays in the American legal system. He was chair of the medicolegal committee of the ARRS, and he believed that X-rays could help to elucidate medical findings for judges and juries. He hoped that the incidence of frivolous lawsuits could be decreased if X-rays were used to objectively characterize the nature of a potential plaintiff's injuries. Personal life In 1907, Kassabian served on the search committee that appointed the first pastor of the Armenian Martyrs' Congregational Church. The next year, he married Virginia Giragosian from Constantinople. He had three brothers; they were jewelers in Smyrna. Radiation-related injuries Kassabian's hands in 1909 Kassabian's clinical work included the acquisition of fluoroscopic images. This work predated the routine use of X-ray plates to take static images, and it required Kassabian to be routinely exposed to high doses of radiation. The doctor first noted reddened areas of skin on his hands in 1900. At first he felt that the issue might be related to the use of metol in developing X-rays, but he realized that the problem persisted even when he handled metol with rubber gloves. Kassabian's first published paper dealt with the irritant effects of X-rays. In that paper, he mentioned the evolution of the issues with his hands. Though Kassabian realized that the X-ray exposure had caused the problem, he argued against the use of the word burns to describe radiation injuries because he thought that this wording might alarm the public and stall the progress that was being made in radiology. In 1902, Kassabian sustained a serious radiation burn to his hand. Six years later, necrosis had set in and two of the fingers on his left hand were amputated. Kassabian kept a journal and took photographs of his hands as his tissue injuries progressed. Kassabian was later diagnosed with skin cancer related to the radiation injuries. He continued to work with vigor during his illness; he did not want his patients to know that he had been made ill by radiation exposure. The cancer spread up Kassabian's arm. Kassabian's physicians, who included Philadelphia surgeon William Williams Keen, performed surgery. Death In the spring of 1910, Kassabian had another cancer-related surgery, this time to remove muscle from his chest. On July 12, 1910, The New York Times reported that the physician was seriously ill and hospitalized at Jefferson Hospital. He died two days later. Shortly before Kassabian's death, the J. B. Lippincott Company announced that it would publish a second edition of his textbook.

He made his debut aged 19 with two works written under the pseudonym Irving Paris, Ma Femme (1927) and Un joli monsieur, but encountered real success under his real name with the operetta Dix-neuf ans (1933). This play was the first to be inspired by light jazz introduced in France by Mireille and the Quintette du Hot Club de France around Stéphane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt. The latter appeared in the orchestra that accompanied the recordings of the play. In 1933, Dix-neuf ans was given 300 times at the Théâtre Daunou. The cast was composed of Éliane de Creus (later replaced by Suzy Delair) and Jean Sablon, surrounded by Lily Mounet, Jean Bastia, Reda Caire and some debutantes including Viviane Romance. The work was performed in the provinces, in Amsterdam and Oran. There were more than 1,500 performances. After the war, Pascal Bastia continued his career with ups and downs, mostly in the provinces with Mademoiselle Star (1945) or Gardes françaises (Reims, 1962). This last play was closer to opéra comique, like Georges van Parys's or Maurice Yvain's latest works. But he would never again find the success of Dix-neuf ans. Pascal Bastia was one of the first composers to not orchestrate his own scores, the American way: Ma Femme was orchestrated by André Sablon (elder brother of John), Un joli Monsieur by Mac Curthy, Dix-neuf ans by Jef de Murel and Michel Emer. On the other hand, he wrote most librettos and lyrics for his operettas. A singer-songwriter, his song were interpreted by the greatest: Jean Sablon, Joséphine Baker, Luc Barney. He also was the author of music and film scripts. He wrote the comedy Ce monde n'est pas pour les anges (1950, Théâtre Édouard VII).

The company was established in March 1999 through a partnership between programmers Lee Bamber and Richard Vanner.  Products  =DarkBASIC= DarkBASIC was released in the year 2000 as a game creation programming language with accompanying IDE and development tools. The language is a structured form of BASIC, similar to AMOS on the Amiga. The purpose of the language is video game creation using Microsoft's DirectX from a BASIC programming language. It is marketed for its ability to allow a novice game developer to make playable games after following its tutorials. It can create both 2D and 3D games by providing function libraries that enable a game to be programmed with considerably less code than with a language such as C++, especially without such dedicated libraries. The software consists of an IDE, debugger and interpreter, and an engine built on DirectX 7. The compiler emits Bytecode that is appended to an interpreter to create a stand-alone executable. Star Wraith is an example game made with DarkBASIC. In 2002, an updated version called DarkBASIC Professional was released that was able to use newer versions of DirectX. The earlier version of the software is now informally referred to as DarkBASIC Classic to distinguish the two products. On 14 August 2008, the last DarkBASIC version (1.21) was released. Since the introduction of DarkBASIC Professional, The Game Creators have stated that there will be no further updates to the language, although it will still be sold. In 2015, TGC lead developer Lee Bamber decided to open source DarkBASIC Professional for the community, to prevent it from becoming unsupported abandonware.dark-basic-pro-open-source on thegamecreators.com (2016)DarkBASIC Professional Discussion / Dark Basic Pro - Out In The Open by Lee Bamber \\"[...] the eventual demise of DBP now that GameGuru is being ported to C++.

The tool is marketed as allowing users to create 3D games without programming and art skills. Games developed with 3D Gamemaker require at least 400 MHz Pentium processor, 64 MB of RAM and DirectX 7.0b to run. Alongside the full boxed release, The 3D Gamemaker was also released in a Lite edition, with fewer categories of assets available and a reduced feature set. The software has a simple point-and-click interface which guides the user through the process of creating the game. The user chooses a scene from one of several different genres (\\"shooter\\", \\"horror\\", \\"war\\", \\"space\\", \\"driving\\", \\"jungle\\", \\"cartoon\\", or \\"silly\\"), and then chooses different characters, weapons, items, enemies and so on. The software includes hundreds of pre-made scenes and 3D objects. The software can also automatically generate a game by choosing random elements. The resulting game can be exported as a standalone Windows executable. The 3D Gamemaker has a built in placement editor that allows the user to indicate where enemies, items, and obstacles go. This is not available in beginner mode or the lite edition. There is also, among other things, a simple level creator. It also includes the ability to import your own media.

The full title and citation was Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Duke of Westminster [1936] A.C. 1;http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/4.html 19 TC 490. The Duke of Westminster used to employ a gardener and pay him from his post-tax income, which was substantial. To reduce tax, the Duke stopped paying the gardener's wage and instead drew up a covenant, agreeing to pay an equivalent amount at the end of every specified period. Under the tax laws of the time, this allowed the Duke to claim the expense as a deduction, thus reducing his taxable income and his liability towards income tax and surtax.https://www.taxinsider.co.uk/680-What_is_The_Difference_Between_Tax_Avoidance_and_Tax_Evasion.html The Department of Inland Revenue challenged this arrangement as tantamounting to tax evasion and took the Duke to court. They however lost their case. The judge, Lord Tomlin, famously said: > Every man is entitled, if he can, to order his affairs so that the tax > attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If > he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however > unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow tax-payers > may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased > tax.[1936] AC 1, 19, quoted at > http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/08/10/the-duke-of-westminster-is- > dead-long-live-the-duke-of-westminster/ Although this ruling was attractive for others seeking to avoid tax legally by creating complex structures, it has since been weakened by subsequent cases where the courts have looked at the overall effect. An example of the courts' later, more restrictive approach was the Ramsay principle where, if a transaction had pre-arranged artificial steps that served no commercial purpose other than to save tax, the proper approach was to tax the effect of the transaction as a whole.

History  The pieces are character pieces of medium difficulty, as a contrast to his major organ works. Reger had written such works already as a student in Wiesbaden. He turned to the organ in Weiden. On 31 December 1901, Reger approached the publisher Henri Hinrichsen of C. F. Peters to find out if he was ready to print in 1902 piano works, songs or chamber music. Henri answered that would prefer organ works easy to play (\\"leichte Spielbarkeit\\"). Reger composed 15 pieces in Munich in 1902, but Peters published twelve in Leipzig in August 1902, in two books (Heft) of six pieces each. Reger dedicated the pieces of Heft 1 to Paul Homeyer, the organist at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, and those of Heft 2 to , a pupil of Anton Bruckner and teacher at the Vienna Conservatory. Both dedicatees were established organists of an older generation, but could not be won to promote Reger's music. A reviewer of the first print wrote in the Monthly Musical Record: \\"The great art of expressing thoughts simply – in other words, concealing the art – is not to be found here; the composer is still in his storm and stress period.\\".

Life The eldest son of seven children of Richard William Jelf and Emmy, Countess of Schlippenbach, lady-in-waiting to Frederica, Duchess of Cumberland, he was born on 19 January 1834 at Berlin, where his father was tutor to Prince George of Cumberland. His younger brothers were Arthur Richard Jelf, and Richard Henry Jelf, governor of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Educated at preparatory schools in Hammersmith and Brighton, Jelf was admitted to Charterhouse School under Augustus Saunders in 1847. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, on 2 June 1852. He held a studentship at Christ Church from 1852 to 1861, and won a first class in classical moderations in 1854. He graduated B.A. with a third class in lit. hum. in 1856, and proceeded M.A. in 1859 and D.D. in 1907. In 1857 Jelf entered Wells Theological College, and the following year he was ordained deacon, becoming priest in 1859. He held curacies at St. Michael's, Highgate (1858–60), St. James's, Clapton (1860–66), and at Aylesbury (1866–68). On the presentation of Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, he became vicar of Blackmoor, Hampshire, in 1868, and in 1874 he accepted from Lord Braybrooke the living of Saffron Walden. In 1878 he was made an honorary canon of St Albans Cathedral. A connection with Rochester Cathedral began with Jelf's appointment in 1880 to a residentiary canonry, a position he held for twenty-seven years. From 1895 he acted as proctor in Convocation for the dean and chapter of Rochester; but he took little part in current controversy. He continued his parish work at Saffron Walden till 1882, and from 1883 to 1889 he had the charge of St Mary's Island Church, Chatham; subsequently he devoted himself to mission work in the diocese. For financial reasons he took on extra clerical duties: the rectory of Wiggonholt near Pulborough in Sussex (1896–7); and when this proved too much, from 1897 St German's, Blackheath. In 1904 Jelf resigned his Blackheath benefice and retired to Rochester; but in 1907 he was appointed Master of Charterhouse in succession to William Haig Brown. He was in poor health shortly after moving to London, and he died on 19 November 1908 at the Master's lodge, Charterhouse. He was buried in Highgate cemetery, and on the same day a memorial service was held in Rochester cathedral. Works A moderate high churchman, Jelf was a friend and godson of Edward Bouverie Pusey, whose Christus consolator (1883) he edited. As a devotional writer, he had influence through popular homiletic publications including: * The Secret Trials of the Christian Life, 1873. * The Rule of God's Commandments, 1878. * The Consolations of the Christian Seasons, 1880. * Work and Worship, 1888, cathedral sermons. * Mother, Home and Heaven, 1891. * Sound Words, their Form and Spirit, 1907, addresses on the Book of Common Prayer. Family Jelf married: # in 1861 Fanny (died 1865), daughter of G. A. Crawley of Highgate, by whom he had one surviving son, and three daughters who died of scarlet fever in 1871; # in 1876 Katherine Frances, younger daughter of Charles Browne Dalton, vicar of St. Michael's, Highgate, who survived him; by her he had three sons and four daughters.

Traffic modeling draws heavily on theoretical foundations like network theory and certain theories from physics like the kinematic wave model. The interesting quantity being modeled and measured is the traffic flow, i.e. the throughput of mobile units (e.g. vehicles) per time and transportation medium capacity (e.g. road or lane width). Models can teach researchers and engineers how to ensure an optimal flow with a minimum number of traffic jams. Traffic models often are the basis of a traffic simulation. In recent articles, percolation theory has been applied to model and study traffic congestion in a city. The quality of the global traffic in a city at a given time can be characterized by a single parameter, the percolation critical threshold. The critical threshold represent the velocity below which one can travel in a large fraction of city network. Above this threshold one can travel only within a relatively small clusters (neighborhoods). The method is able to identify repetitive traffic bottlenecks. Critical exponents characterizing the cluster size distribution of good traffic are similar to those of percolation theory. A method to identify functional clusters of spatio-temporal streets that represent fluent traffic flow in a city has been developed by Serok et al. An empirical study regarding the size distribution of traffic jams has been performed recently by Zhang et al. They found an approximate universal power law for the jam sizes distribution. A simulation model for urban traffic can be found in ref.

VTScada communicates with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), pump controllers and other devices using radio, LAN, WAN, cellular, or phone lines. This information is logged and displayed to users on a computer screen via trend graphs, reports, or graphical display pages. The software can also send control signals back to the devices to control the process. The VTScada software is used by nearly 900 municipalities across the United States, and thousands of industrial customers globally. Notable uses of the software include: * An estimated one-third of drilled North Sea oil is controlled by VTScada * The City of Sacramento, California uses VTScada for monitoring and control of its fresh and wastewater infrastructure, with a license that supports up to 500,000 data points * Toyota uses VTScada to control its Kentucky assembly plant * Shannon Airport in Shannon, Ireland, and Halifax Stanfield International Airport in Halifax, Canada use the software to control their customs systems * The Miami Dade County, Florida Water and Sewer Department uses VTScada in their stormwater management system, to monitor up to 500,000 data points History Glenn Wadden founded Trihedral in 1986. In 1988, the company released “WEB”; one of the first PC-based SCADA packages that ran on the DOS platform. Trihedral briefly trademarked the term \\"WEB\\" in 1990, before the Internet's widespread proliferation. In 1998, Trihedral Engineering Limited opened a 100% wholly owned subsidiary, Trihedral UK, in Aberdeen, Scotland. In 1997, WEB became Visual Tag System (VTS) and was updated to run on the Windows operating system. By 2007, Trihedral had developed VTScada, an integrated toolset of telemetry features designed for the water and wastewater industry. The same year, Trihedral, Inc., opened in Orlando, Florida. Awards * In 2015, Control Engineering (magazine) named VTScada winner of the Control Engineering Engineer’s Choice award in the HMI Software category. * Canada's Top 100 Employers ranked Trihedral among Nova Scotia’s Top Employers from 2007 to 2013.

It was subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the police authority of the country. History The Internal Troops of Georgia were formed on 12 September 1991, five months after the nation's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. They descended from the Soviet Union's Internal Troops. They were tasked with aiding the Ministry of Internal Affairs in security measures, fighting against organized crime, terrorism, and subversion, as well as safeguarding—independently or with other law enforcement agencies—important facilities and special cargoes, and, finally, with participating in the country's defense during wartime. The Internal Troops were staffed primarily through conscription but were also partially contract-based. The Internal Troops saw action in various conflicts and operations during the post-Soviet unrest in Georgia, including in South Ossetia (1991–1992, 2004), Abkhazia (1992–1993), and the Pankisi Gorge (2002–2005). By the end of 1995 the force had some 5,000 to 7,000 troops in its ranks, making it the third largest military structure in Georgia after the Russian troops stationed in the country at that time and the Georgian Armed Forces. The Internal Troops included patrol units, a special subdivision for guarding prisons, the 1st Operational Motor-Rifle Brigade in Tbilisi, the 2nd Operational Motor-Rifle Brigade in Kutaisi, the Batumi separate battalion, and a helicopter unit with at least 2 MI-8s. They had at least 10 heavy and light tanks and antitank weapons. The official budget in 1997 amounted to 5,312 GEL ( US$4.2 million); official salaries were low and the reports of corruption were widespread. In the framework of the post-Rose Revolution reforms in Georgia's military and security forces, in November 2004, the Internal Troops were abolished and all its munitions and infrastructure were transferred to the Ministry of Defense. A bulk of the Interior Troops personnel formed the 4th Infantry Brigade of the Georgian Land Forces.

It is also known as after the wider area of the province. This was the area where the great majority of early Japanese porcelain, especially Japanese export porcelain, was made. In English usage \\"Arita ware\\" was traditionally used for the export wares in blue and white porcelain, mostly copying Chinese styles. The wares with added overglaze colours were called Imari ware or (a sub-group) Kakiemon. It is now recognized that the same kilns often made more than one of these types, and \\"Arita ware\\" is more often used as a term for all of them.Impey (1990), 71-73 The brightly coloured Kutani ware is another type that is now recognised as coming from around Arita as well as the Kutani itself, and \\"Kutani-type\\" is used as a stylistic description. History According to tradition, the Korean potter Yi Sam-pyeong (d. 1655), or Kanagae Sanbee (), is often considered the father of Arita ware porcelain. This narrative is however disputed by many historians.Komiya Kiyora 小宮木代良, \\"tōso\\" gensetsu no rekishiteki zentei 「陶祖」言説の歴史的前提, Nitchō kōryū to sōkoku no rekisi 日朝交流と相克の歴史, pp. 363-381, 2009.Komiya Kiyora 小宮木代良, \\"tōso\\" gensetsu no seiritsu to tenkai 「陶祖」言説の成立と展開 (The origins and expansion of the story of Touso, the first ceramist), Kyūshū Shigaku 九州史学, No. 153, pp. 49-74, 2009. He is nevertheless honoured in Sueyama Shrine as the founder. The first porcelain made in Japan followed the discovery of porcelain clay near Arita near the end of the 16th century. A number of kilns opened up in the area, and a considerable variety of styles were made, the Japanese export porcelain destined for Europe often using Western shapes and Chinese decoration. Early wares used underglaze blue decoration, but by the mid-17th century Arita was in the forefront as Japan developed overglaze \\"enamelled\\" decoration in a range of bright colours.Smith, Harris, & Clark, 163-165; Ford & Impey, 61-118; Watson, 260-261 Between the second half of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century they were extensively exported to Europe, travelling initially from Arita's port of Imari, Saga to the Dutch East India Company's outpost at Nagasaki. The type called kin-rande was especially popular and is therefore known in the West also as . This typically is decorated in underglaze blue, then with red, gold, black for outlines, and sometimes other colours, added in overglaze. In the most characteristic floral designs most of the surface is coloured, with \\"a tendency to overdecoration that leads to fussiness\\". The style was so successful that Chinese and European producers began to copy it.Impey (1990), 74-75, 75 quoted Arita ware incense burner (kōro) with domestic scenes, late Edo period/early Meiji era, 19th century Nabeshima ware was an Arita product, with overglaze decoration of a very high quality, produced for the Nabeshima Lords of the Saga Domain from the late 17th century into the 19th, with the first half of the 18th century considered the finest period. It was never exported at the time.Impey (1990), 78-79 Kakiemon is a term that generates further confusion, being the name of a family, one or more kilns, and a brightly-coloured overglaze style broadly imitating Chinese wares. The style originated with the family, whose kilns were the main producers of it, but other kilns also made it, and the Kakiemon kilns made other styles. It was also widely imitated in Europe, and sometimes in China.Impey (1990), 75-77 Evidence from modern excavation of kiln-sites shows that much of the Kutani ware, supposedly from Honshu island, was in fact made around Arita. This was largely made for export to southeast Asian markets.Impey (1990), 77-78 The kilns in Arita also produced plain white Hakuji porcelain, often imitating the Chinese equivalent Dehua porcelain. One of the patterns used is Karako (唐子) with the depiction of Chinese children playing. Notes References *Ford, Barbara Brennan, and Oliver R.

Currently, the territory that comprised Câmpulung County is now included at present in Suceava County. In the interwar period, the county was bordered by Rădăuți County to the north, Suceava County to the east, Baia County to the southeast, Neamț and Mureș Counties to the south, and Năsăud County to the west. History Câmpulung County as constituted in 1928 After World War I, the territory of the county along with most of Transylvania was transferred from Austria-Hungary to Romania. This transfer was confirmed in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. Based on the 1923 Romanian Constitution and the Law of Administrative Unification of 1925, Câmpulung County was established, with its capital at Câmpulung Moldovenesc. In 1938, the county was disestablished and incorporated into the newly formed Ținutul Suceava, but it was re-established in 1940 after the fall of Carol II's regime. In World War II, the county was invaded and occupied by Soviet forces. Following the administrative and territorial reform of 1950, made after the Soviet model, all counties were abolished and regions and districts established. The territory of the county then became part of Suceava Region. On 17 February 1968 the administrative and territorial divisions were returned to counties, but Câmpulung County was not re- established.

He joined the ranks of the Soviet-era police, militsiya, in 1978 and continued his service in police of independent Georgia in 1991. Having served as Vice-Rector of Police Academy from 1992 to 1994, he then held commanding positions in the Internal Troops and became promoted to major-general in 1996. That year, he was appointed as commander of the Internal Troops of Georgia and in 2002 oversaw a special police operation to clear Georgia's Pankisi Gorge of infiltrating Islamist elements fighting against Russia in neighboring Chechnya. He was decorated with the Order of Vakhtang Gorgasali, 3rd Class.

He became involved in politics in 2007 and made an unsuccessful bid to run for presidency in the 2008 election, but the Georgian election authorities refused to register his candidacy on account of his lack of required number of supporters.

Biography  Brother of Abbé Étienne-Louis Billardon de Sauvigny, he studied in Paris and embraced the career of arms probably followed by his father. A few pieces of verse having made him known in the society at a time when the witty minds were in favor, he was admitted in the bodyguards of Stanislas Leszczynski, King of Poland and Duke of Lorraine, but he was already no longer there in 1762, and returned to Paris, where he was the privileged poet of the comtesse du Barry. Sauvigny had obtained a cavalry lieutenancy, and later the cross of the Order of St. Louis, but his pension and the meagre income from his dramatic works could not suffice for his existence, he worked for the booksellers, and published new productions almost every year. He owed to the protection of Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, duchess of Chartres, a royal censorship position in 1776. In 1788, for having approved the publication of l'Almanach des honnêtes gens, by Sylvain Maréchal, he was exiled by a lettre de cachet 30 leagues from Paris, and threatened to remove from his place which the Revolution made him lose shortly afterwards. He adopted its principles with moderation and was attached, in 1789, with the title of Adjutant General, to the general staff of the national cavalry at the military academy, of which he had the provisional command in 1792. It was in this capacity that he wrote to the Paris Commune, to tell it about the disturbances caused in the on 4 November by a civic festival in which companies of this guard had taken part, against the federated Marseillais. He was later appointed colonel of a regiment of veterans, and was not employed neither under the Consulate nor under the Empire, but he got a small job at the Ministry of the Interior. He was so forgotten in his later years that Palissot in 1803 did not know if he was still alive. The Biographie universelle by Michaud mistook him for his brother, and placed his death in 1809. Probably because of this omission, some biographers gave birth to him around 1730 in the diocese of Auxerre, others in 1734 in Paris or 1736 in La Rochelle. We have verse compositions of him, as well as dramatic works, of which only la Mort de Socrate was successful. He was better off as a writer.

Built in 1937, it is a rare late example of a one-room schoolhouse, made further distinctive by the survival of its original schoolroom interior. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. Description and history The Root School stands in a rural setting in eastern Norwich, on the north side of Union Village Road, a short way east of its junction with Goodrich Four Corners Road and Pattell Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation of concrete blocks and poured concrete. The main entrance is in the western facade, facing the small parking area, and is sheltered by a gabled porch. Sash windows line the western and southern facades. The interior has a narrow vestibule, which opens into the main chamber. It has a stage at one end, and retains original wood flooring, wainscoting, and a woodstove with an unusual safety enclosure. The stage is effectively recessed between a small kitchen (formerly a cloakroam) on one side, and bathrooms on the other. The school was built in 1937, a fairly late period for the construction of these types of district school buildings. It was used until 1946 for educational purposes, and has been used since then by a variety of community organizations, most recently as a community clubhouse. It is unusual among one-room schoolhouses for retaining most of its original interior, which is often lost when such buildings are converted to other uses. This school, along with the Beaver Meadow School, was among the last of the town's district schools to close.

Based on the 1923 Romanian Constitution and the Law of Administrative Unification of 1925, the name of the county remained as it was, but the territory was reorganized. Its capital remained Făgăraş. The new county divided into three administrative districts (), it neighbored Târnava-Mare County to the north, Brașov County to the east, Muscel and Argeș counties to the south, and Sibiu County to the west. In 1938, the county was disestablished and incorporated into the newly formed Ținutul Mureș, but it was re-established in 1940 after the fall of Carol II's regime. In World War II, the county was invaded and occupied by Soviet forces. As in other parts of the country in 1945, part of the Saxon population of Făgăraş County was deported to the Soviet Union, where some survivors returned after about five years. Following the administrative and territorial reform of 1950, made after the Soviet model, all counties were abolished and regions and districts established. The territory of the county then became part of Țara Făgărașului. On 17 February 1968 the administrative and territorial divisions were returned to counties, but Făgăraş County was not re-established. The territory Țara Făgărașului was divided between the counties of Braşov and Sibiu.

Jimma CTE is one of several regional Teachers’ Training Colleges in Ethiopia established specifically to produce qualified teachers for primary schools (grades 1-8). In accordance with the 1994 National Education and Training Policy, Jimma CTE was upgraded from a Teachers’ Training Institute (TTI) as it had been for 28 years (1961-1988 E.C.) and, as a college, launched its first two-year Training Program (Diploma Program) in July 1988 E.C. during the summer semester. It goes without saying that such an important educational change-over as the inauguration of Jimma CTE, which took place after nearly three decades after the institution’s inception as a TTI, caused a certain excitement as well as some anxiety amongst those who were closely affiliated to the college. The transformation required great imagination and better physical resources and, although Jimma CTE still has a long way to go before it becomes a fully-grown institution of higher education, it has made a good start towards meeting the growing regional demand for qualified primary school teachers.

Porro was born to nobles and became a priest after the death of his father. He remained a hermit in convents in places such as Florence and Milan where he dedicated his life to inward meditation and self- mortification until his death. Charles Borromeo was healed as a child due to Porro's intercession and carried with him a foot bone fragment from Porro's incorrupt remains. Porro was beatified in 1737 after Pope Clement XIII confirmed that there was an enduring and local 'cultus' - or popular veneration - to the late priest. Life Giovannangelo Porro was born in 1451 in Seveso to the nobleman Protasio Porro and Franceschina as one of three male children. The death of his father in 1468 prompted him to enter the Servite Order around this time while becoming a professed member on 20 December 1470. In the summer of 1474 he travelled to a convent in Florence where he was later ordained as a priest and he remained there until around 1477 when he went to the convent of Monte Senario to dedicate his time to meditation as well as the penitential practices of fasting and self-mortification - he would remain there for about two decades. Towards the end of 1488 the unwell Porro went to the Basilica of the Annunciation in Florence and after his recuperation spent a few months as a convent prior in Chianti. Porro returned to Milan in or around 1495 and remained for a brief period at the Cavacuta convent in Lodi. He became noted for his love of nature. He died on 23 October 1505. His tomb became a place of pilgrimage where miracles were said to have occurred. One mother bought her ill son, Charles Borromeo, for a cure to his illness and he was cured. Borromeo removed a small bone from Porro's foot - he was incorrupt - and he carried it as a reminder of that cure. Beatification His local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - seems to have been spontaneous at the time of his death but flourished after 1511. The formal ratification of this enduring local 'cultus' on 15 July 1737 allowed for Pope Clement XIII to issue formal approval for his beatification.

History The name Lincoln sign is based on a hypothetical diagnosis for a patient, namely the USA's 16th president Abraham Lincoln. In 1962, Dr Abraham M. Gordon suggested that Lincoln had Marfan's syndrome. In 1964, Dr Harold Schwartz adduced further evidence that Lincoln might have had Marfan syndrome. Later, Schwartz suggested that, based upon evidence shown in a famous photograph, Lincoln had the aortic insufficiency associated with what is now called Lincoln sign.

The new company was originally named \\"Mashov Software Export (MSE)\\", and developed software for the global market, specifically an application generator named Magic. Mashov’s major innovation was a metadata-driven approach to programming that required no compiling or linking, and also allowed instantaneous debugging. The Magic platform was originally designed and developed by Jonathan (Yoni) Hashkes, along with Miko Hasson who was responsible for programme management. During the 1980s, the company grew due to its sales of the DOS and UNIX platforms. The product was used by many large organizations, including the Israel Defense Forces. In 1991, the company changed its name to \\"Magic Software Enterprises\\" (retaining the acronym: MSE) and became the first Israeli software company to go public on the NASDAQ. During this period, the company developed a close relationship with IBM, focusing on AS/400 systems. In mid-1995, the first version of Magic for Windows was released. In 1998, Magic was acquired by the Formula Group, headed by Dan Goldstein. In February 2000, it raised over $100 million and traded at a company valuation of $1 billion. In 2001, Magic released \\"eDeveloper\\" (Rohan), a graphical, rules- based, and event-driven framework that offered a pre-compiled engine for database business tasks and a wide variety of generic runtime services and functions.

For the current situation since 2000 see Foreign relations of the United Kingdom. Britain from 1750 to the 1910s took pride in an unmatched economic base; comprising industry, finance, shipping and trade that largely dominated the globe. Foreign policy based on free trade (after 1840) kept the economy flourishing. The overseas British Empire recovered after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1776, and reached its zenith about 1920. Foreign policy made sure it was never seriously threatened. After expending enormous energy on the defeat of the First French Empire and Napoleon (1793–1815), British policy focused on achieving a conservative balance of power within Europe, with no one country achieving dominance over the affairs of the continent. This had been the basic reason behind the British wars against Napoleon, and the British commitment in World War I and World War II. The chief enemy down to 1815 was France, with its much larger population base and its powerful army. The British were generally successful in their many wars, with the notable exception of the American War of Independence (1775–1783). In that war Britain, without any major allies, was defeated by the colonials who had the support of the Kingdom of France and the Dutch Republic, while France had support from Spain.See Jeremy Black, \\"Could the British Have Won the American War of Independence?.\\" Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research. (Fall 1996), Vol. 74 Issue 299, pp 145–154. online 90-minute video lecture given at Ohio State in 2006; requires Real Player A favoured diplomatic strategy was subsidising the armies of continental allies, such as the Kingdom of Prussia, thereby turning London's enormous financial power to military advantage. Britain relied heavily on its Royal Navy for security, seeking to keep it the most powerful fleet afloat with a full complement of bases across the globe. British dominance of the seas was vital to the formation of the British Empire, which was achieved through the maintenance of a Navy larger than the next two largest Navies combined for the majority of the 19th and early 20th centuries, prior to the entry of the United States into World War II. The British controlled the oceans. So powerful was the Royal Navy, it needed to do little actual fighting from 1812 to 1914. Although all of the other great powers fought with their neighbours, the British Army had only one relatively limited war (the Crimean War against the Russian Empire in 1854–56). The Army mostly handled garrison duty, and did have to deal with localized insurrections and colonial conflicts in Asia and Africa. For a capsule guide to the wars, see List of conflicts involving the United Kingdom. English foreign policy before 1700 In 1500 England had only a modest population (3.8 million) compared to its much larger rivals of France (15 million), Spain (6.5 million), and the Holy Roman Empire (17 million). It was three times larger than its naval rival, the Netherlands, and eight times larger than Scotland.Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones, Atlas of world population history (Penguin, 1978) pp. 43, 47, 57, 65,71, 101 The limited budget, limited ambitions on the continent, avoidance of alliances, and the protection afforded by the English Channel from foreign invasion combined to make foreign affairs less pressing for the British government before 1688. Elite elements paid little attention to Continental affairs before the 1660s, and there was little clamour to enter the Thirty Years War of 1618–48. Historian Lawrence Stone says England \\"was no more than a marginal player in the European power game.\\" The increasingly powerful Royal Navy attracted admiration, but London used it to support its growing overseas empire.Steven C. A. Pincus, Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650–1668 (1996) pp 1–7, quote p 1. =Tudor foreign policy= King Henry VII (reigned 1485–1509) founded the Tudor dynasty that lasted to 1603, and concentrated on establishing peace in England, especially against the threatened rebellions by the newly defeated House of York. Foreign affairs apart from Scotland were not a high priority. Scotland was an independent country, and peace was agreed to in 1497. Much of his diplomacy involved treaties for marriages with ruling houses in Europe. He married his eldest daughter Margaret Tudor to King James IV of Scotland in 1503. The match did not guarantee peace in the short run but did so in the long run: in 1603 James VI and I, the grandson of the marriage, united the two kingdoms under his rule. Henry tried to marry his daughter Mary to the man who later became Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, but that fell through. Henry VIII finally married her to King Louis XII of France as part of a peace treaty in 1514; Louis died after three months and Henry demanded and got most of her dowry back. The other main diplomatic success of Henry VII was an alliance with Spain, sealed by the marriage in 1501 of his heir Arthur, Prince of Wales, to Catherine of Aragon, Spain's infanta (eldest daughter of the Spanish king). When his Queen died in 1503, Henry VII searched the European marriage market for a diplomatic marriage with a large dowry for himself, but was unable to find a match.P.S. Crowson Tudor Foreign Policy (1973) ch 1–2. Arthur died in 1502 and the second son married the widow in 1509, just after he became king as Henry VIII, Henry VIII King Henry VIII (reigned 1509–1547) was one of the most flamboyant and famous of all English monarchs. In military terms, he paid special attention to expanding the English Navy, to protect the rapidly expanding merchant fleet. He also commissioned privateers from the merchant fleets to act as auxiliary warships that captured and resold enemy merchant ships. Some of his foreign and religious policy revolved around annulling his marriage to Catherine in 1533 despite the opposition of the pope—his solution was to remove the Church of England from the pope's authority, thereby launching the English Reformation.R.B. Wernham, Before the Armada: the growth of English foreign policy, 1485–1588 (1966) pp. 111–35. In 1510, France, with a fragile alliance with the Holy Roman Empire in the League of Cambrai, was winning a war against Venice. Henry renewed his father's friendship with Louis XII of France, and signed a pact with King Ferdinand of Spain. After Pope Julius II created the anti-French Holy League in October 1511, Henry followed Spain's lead and brought England into the new League. An initial joint Anglo-Spanish attack was planned for the spring to recover Aquitaine for England, the start of making Henry's dreams of ruling France a reality. The attack failed and it strained the Anglo-Spanish alliance. Nevertheless, the French were pushed out of Italy soon after, and the alliance survived, with both parties keen to win further victories over the French.J.J. Scarisbrick, Henry VIII (1958) pp 27–34. Henry with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (right) and Pope Leo X (centre), c. 1520 On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and his troops defeated a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – a relatively minor result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Thérouanne and handed it over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage.Scarisbrick, Henry VIII, pp 35–56. His absence from the country, however, had prompted James IV of Scotland, to invade England at the behest of Louis. The English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513, in which James IV and many senior Scottish nobles died.R.L. Mackie, King James IV of Scotland: A brief survey of his life and times (1976). online Charles V ascended the thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire following the deaths of his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and an opportunity for a clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, an early non-aggression pact among the major kingdoms of western Europe.Garrett Mattingly , \\"An Early Nonaggression Pact,\\" Journal of Modern History 10#1 (1938): 1–30. online In a significant follow- up, Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish and extremely expensive entertainment. The hope that warfare was past proved futile. Charles brought his Holy Roman Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Henry had repeatedly raised taxes to pay for his foreign operations until upscale passive resistance in 1525 forced the ending of the newest tax known as the \\"Amicable Grant.\\"G.W. Bernard, War, Taxation, and Rebellion in Early Tudor England: Henry VIII, Wolsey, and the Amicable Grant of 1525 (1986). Lack of money ended Henry's plans for an invasion of France and he took England out of the war with the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.Scarisbrick, Henry VIII, pp 135–42. New World Just five years after Columbus, in 1497 Henry VII commissioned the Italian mariner John Cabot who had settled in England, to explore the New World. Cabot was the first European since the Norsemen to reach parts of what is now Canada, exploring from Newfoundland to as far south as Delaware. He found no gold or spices and the king lost interest. Colonization was not a high priority for the Tudors, who were much more interested in raiding the Spanish treasure ships than in acquiring their own colonies.J. A. Williamson, The voyages of the Cabots and the English discovery of North America under Henry VII and Henry VIII (1929).< Conflict with Spain, 1568-1604 Treasure crisis of 1568 The \\"Treasure crisis\\" of 1568 was Queen Elizabeth's seizure of gold from Spanish ships in English ports in November 1568. Chased by privateers in the English channel, five small Spanish ships carrying gold and silver worth 400,000 florins (£85,000) sought shelter in English harbors at Plymouth and Southampton. The English government headed by William Cecil gave permission. The money was bound for the Netherlands as payment for Spanish soldiers who were fighting rebels there. Queen Elizabeth discovered that the gold was not owned by Spain, but was still owned by Italian bankers. She decided to seize it, and treated as a loan from the Italian bankers to England. The bankers agree to her terms, so Elizabeth had the money and she eventually repaid the bankers. Spain reacted furiously, and seized English property in the Netherlands and Spain. England reacted by seizing Spanish ships and properties in England. Spain reacted by imposing an embargo preventing all English imports into the Netherlands. The bitter diplomatic standoff lasted for four years.Wallace T. MacCaffrey, The Shaping of the Elizabethan Regime (1968) pp 271–90. However neither side wanted war. In 1573, the Convention of Nymegen was a treaty where England promised to end support for raids on Spanish shipping by English privateers such as Francis Drake and John Hawkins. It was finalized in the Convention of Bristol in August, 1574 in which both sides paid for what they had seized. Trade resumed between England and Spain and relations improved.John Wagner, ed. Historical Dictionary of the Elizabethan World: Britain, Ireland, Europe and America (1999) pp 39, 216, 307–8. = Armada = The Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) arose largely from religious differences; the execution of Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots in 1587 outraged Spain. War was never formally declared. Spain was militarily and financially much more powerful, and promoted a Catholic interest in opposition to England's Protestantism. The conflict saw widely separated battles, and began with England's military expedition in 1585 to the Spanish Netherlands (modern-day Belgium) in support of the resistance of the States General to Spanish Habsburg rule.Charles Beem, The Foreign Relations of Elizabeth I (2011) The English enjoyed a modest victory by \\"Singeing the King of Spain's Beard\\" in 1587 at Cádiz, the main port in Spain. The raid led by Francis Drake destroyed numerous merchant ships and captured some treasure. The great English triumph was the decisive defeat of the Spanish invasion attempt by the ill-fated Spanish Armada in 1588.Garrett Mattingly, The Armada (1959) is a famous narrative; recent scholarship is reviewed in Colin Martin and Geoffrey Parker, eds., The Spanish Armada (2nd ed. 1999). After Elizabeth died in 1603, the new king made peace a high priority and ended the long- simmering conflict in 1604.Susan Doran, Elizabeth I and Foreign policy, 1558–1603 (Routledge, 2002). =Stuart foreign policy= By 1600 the conflict with Spain became deadlocked during campaigns in Brittany and Ireland. James I, the new king of England made peace with the new King of Spain, Philip III with the Treaty of London in 1604. They agreed to cease their military interventions in the Spanish Netherlands and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas privateering against Spanish merchant ships. King James I (reigned 1603–25) was sincerely devoted to peace, not just for his three kingdoms, but for Europe as a whole.Roger Lockyer, James VI and I (1998) pp 138–58. He disliked Puritans and Jesuits alike, because of their eagerness for warfare. He called himself \\"Rex Pacificus\\" (\\"King of peace.\\")Malcolm Smuts, \\"The making of Rex Pacificus: James VI and I and the Problem of Peace in an Age of Religious War,\\" in Daniel Fischlin and Mark Fortier, eds., Royal Subjects: Essays on the Writings of James VI and I (2002) pp 371–87 Europe was deeply polarized, and on the verge of the massive Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), with the smaller established Protestant states facing the aggression of the larger Catholic empires. On assuming the throne, James made peace with Catholic Spain, and made it his policy to marry his son to the Spanish Infanta (princess) in the \\"Spanish Match\\". The marriage of James' daughter Princess Elizabeth to Frederick V, Elector Palatine on 14 February 1613 was more than the social event of the era; the couple's union had important political and military implications. Across Europe, the German princes were banding together in the Union of German Protestant Princes, headquartered in Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatine. King James calculated that his daughter's marriage would give him diplomatic leverage among the Protestants. He thus planned to have a foot in both camps and be able to broker peaceful settlements. In his naïveté, he did not realize that both sides were playing him as a tool for their own goal of achieving destroying the other side. Spain's ambassador Count Gondomar knew how to manipulate the king. The Catholics in Spain, as well as the Emperor Ferdinand II, the Vienna-based leader of the Habsburgs and head of the Holy Roman Empire, were both heavily influenced by the Catholic counter-Reformation. They had the goal of expelling Protestantism from their domains.W. B. Patterson, \\"King James I and the Protestant cause in the crisis of 1618–22.\\" Studies in Church History 18 (1982): 319–334. Lord Buckingham (1592–1628), who increasingly was the actual ruler of Britain, wanted an alliance with Spain. Buckingham took Charles with him to Spain to woo the Infanta in 1623. However, Spain's terms were that James must drop Britain's anti-Catholic intolerance or no marriage. Buckingham and Charles were humiliated and Buckingham became the leader of the widespread British demand for a war against Spain. Meanwhile, the Protestant princes looked to Britain, since it was the strongest of all the Protestant countries, to give military support for their cause. His son- in-law and daughter became king and queen of Bohemia, which outraged Vienna. The Thirty Years’ War began, as the Habsburg Emperor ousted the new king and queen of Bohemia, and massacred their followers. Catholic Bavaria then invaded the Palatine, and James's son-in-law begged for James's military intervention. James finally realized his policies had backfired and refused these pleas. He successfully kept Britain out of the European-wide war that proved so heavily devastating for three decades. James's backup plan was to marry his son Charles to a French Catholic princess, who would bring a handsome dowry. Parliament and the British people were strongly opposed to any Catholic marriage, were demanding immediate war with Spain, and strongly favored with the Protestant cause in Europe. James had alienated both elite and popular opinion in Britain, and Parliament was cutting back its financing. Historians credit James for pulling back from a major war at the last minute, and keeping Britain in peace.Jonathan Scott, England's Troubles: 17th-century English Political Instability in European Context (Cambridge UP, 2000), pp 98–101Godfrey Davies, The Early Stuarts: 1603–1660 (1959), pp 47–67 The crisis in Bohemia in 1619, and the conflagration that resulted, marked the beginning of the disastrous Thirty Years' War. King James' determination to avoid involvement in the continental conflict, even during the \\"war fever\\" of 1623, appears in retrospect as one of the most significant, and most positive, aspects of his reign. During 1600–1650 England made repeated efforts to colonize Guiana in South America. They all failed and the lands (Surinam) were ceded to the Dutch in 1667.Joyce Lorimer, \\"The failure of the English Guiana ventures 1595–1667 and James I's foreign policy.\\" Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History 21#.1 (1993): 1–30.Albert J. Loomie, Spain & the Early Stuarts, 1585–1655 (1996). King Charles I (1600-1649) trusted Lord Buckingham, who made himself rich in the process but proved a failure at foreign and military policy. Charles gave him command of the military expedition against Spain in 1625. It was a total fiasco with many dying from disease and starvation. He led another disastrous military campaign in 1627. Buckingham was hated and the damage to the king's reputation was irreparable. England rejoiced when he was assassinated in 1628 by John Felton.Thomas Cogswell, \\"John Felton, popular political culture, and the assassination of the duke of Buckingham.\\" Historical Journal 49.2 (2006): 357-385.

London financed the emigration of many to England and its colonies around 1700. Some 40,000-50,000 settled in England, mostly in towns near the sea in the southern districts, with the largest concentration in London where they constituted about 5% of the total population in 1700.Roy A. Sundstrom, \\"French Huguenots and the Civil List, 1696-1727: A Study of Alien Assimilation in England.\\" Albion 8.3 (1976): 219-235.Robin Gwynn, \\"The number of Huguenot immigrants in England in the late seventeenth century.\\" Journal of Historical Geography 9.4 (1983): 384-395.Robin Gwynn, \\"England's First Refugees\\" History Today (May 1985) 38#5 pp 22-28.

The British government ignored the complaints made by local craftsmen about the favoritism shown foreigners.Heinz Schilling,\\"Innovation through migration: the settlements of Calvinistic Netherlanders in sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Central and Western Europe.\\" Histoire Sociale/Social History 16.31 (1983). onlineMark Greengrass, \\"Protestant exiles and their assimilation in early modern England.\\" Immigrants & Minorities 4.3 (1985): 68-81. Many became private tutors, schoolmasters, travelling tutors and owners of riding schools, where they were hired by the upper class.Michael Green, \\"Bridging the English Channel: Huguenots in the educational milieu of the English upper class.\\" Paedagogica Historica 54.4 (2018): 389-409 online The immigrants assimilated well in terms of using English, joining the Church of England, intermarriage and business success. They founded the silk industry in England.Irene Scouloudi, ed.

In terms of impact on British foreign policy, a keen new interest in humanitarian intervention, intended to prevent foreign governments from punishing people for their religious beliefs was emerging during the early eighteenth century. In large part this new sensibility was based on the happy experience of protecting Huguenots in France and taking in many refugees who became very good citizens.Catherine S. Arnold, \\"Affairs of humanity: Arguments for humanitarian intervention in England and Europe, 1698–1715.\\" English Historical Review 133.563 (2018): 835-865. =Anglo Dutch Wars= The Anglo-Dutch Wars were a series of three wars which took place between the English and the Dutch from 1652 to 1674.C.R. Boxer, The Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th Century (1974). The causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping. Religion was not a factor, since both sides were Protestant.Steven C. A. Pincus, Protestantism and Patriotism: Ideologies and the Making of English Foreign Policy, 1650–1668 (1996) The British in the first war (1652–54) had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful \\"ships of the line\\" which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era. The British also captured numerous Dutch merchant ships. In the second war (1665–67) Dutch naval victories followed. This second war cost London ten times more than it had planned on, and the king sued for peace in 1667 with the Treaty of Breda. It ended the fights over \\"mercantilism\\" (that is, the use of force to protect and expand national trade, industry, and shipping.) Meanwhile, the French were building up fleets that threatened both the Netherlands and Great Britain. In third war (1672–74), The British counted on a new alliance with France but the outnumbered Dutch outsailed both of them, and King Charles II ran short of money and political support. The Dutch gained domination of sea trading routes until 1713. The British gained the thriving colony of New Netherland, and renamed it New York.James Rees Jones, The Anglo-Dutch wars of the seventeenth century (1996) onlineGijs Rommelse, \\"The role of mercantilism in Anglo‐Dutch political relations, 1650–74.\\" Economic History Review 63#3 (2010): 591–611. Europe in 1700; England and Ireland are in red. =William III: 1689–1702= The primary reason the English Parliament called on William to invade England in 1688 was to overthrow King James II, and stop his efforts to reestablish Catholicism and tolerate Puritanism. However the primary reason William accepted the challenge was to gain a powerful ally in his war to contain the threatened expansion of King Louis XIV of France. William's goal was to build coalitions against the powerful French monarchy, protect the autonomy of the Netherlands (where William continued in power) and to keep the Spanish Netherlands (present-date Belgium) out of French hands. The English aristocracy was intensely anti—French, and customarily supported William's broad goals.George Clark, The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714 (2nd ed. 1956) pp 148–53.Clayton Roberts et al., A History of England: volume I Prehistory to 1714 (5th ed. 2013) pp 245–48. For his entire career in Netherlands and Britain, William was the arch-enemy of Louis XIV. The Catholic King of France, in turn, denounced the Protestant William as a usurper who had illegally taken the throne from the legitimate Catholic King James II, and that he ought to be overthrown.Mark A. Thomson, \\"Louis XIV and William III, 1689–1697.\\" English Historical Review 76.298 (1961): 37–58. online In May 1689, William, now king of England, with the support of Parliament, declared war on France. Historian J.R. Jones states that King William was given: :supreme command within the alliance throughout the Nine Years war. His experience and knowledge of European affairs made him the indispensable director of Allied diplomatic and military strategy, and he derived additional authority from his enhanced status as king of England – even the Emperor Leopold...recognized his leadership. William's English subjects played subordinate or even minor roles in diplomatic and military affairs, having a major share only in the direction of the war at sea. Parliament and the nation had to provide money, men and ships, and William had found it expedient to explain his intentions...but this did not mean that Parliament or even ministers assisted in the formulation of policy.J.R. Jones, Britain and the World, 1649–1815 (1980) p. 157. England and France were at war almost continuously until 1713, with a short interlude 1697–1701 made possible by the Treaty of Ryswick.Clark, The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714 (1956) pp 160–79. The combined English and Dutch fleets could overpower France in a far-flung naval war, but France still had superiority on land. William wanted to neutralize that advantage by allying with Leopold I, the Habsburg Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1658–1705), who was based in Vienna, Austria. Leopold, however, Was tied down in war with the Ottoman Empire on his eastern frontiers; William worked to achieve a negotiated settlement between the Ottomans and the Empire. William displayed in imaginative Europe-wide strategy, but Louis always managed to come up with a counter play.For the European context, see J.S. Bromley, ed. The New Cambridge Modern History, VI: The Rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688–1725 (1970) pp 154–192, 223–67, 284–90, 381–415, 741–54. William was usually supported by the English leadership, which saw France as its greatest enemy. But eventually the expenses, and war weariness, caused second thoughts. At first, Parliament voted him the funds for his expensive wars, and for his subsidies to smaller allies. Private investors created the Bank of England in 1694; it provided a sound system that made financing wars much easier by encouraging bankers to loan money.John Brewer, The sinews of power: War, money, and the English state, 1688–1783 (1989) p 133.Clark, The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714 (1956) pp 174–79. In the long-running Nine Years' War (1688–97) his main strategy was to form a military alliance of England, the Netherlands, the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, and some smaller states, to attack France at sea, and from land in different directions, while defending the Netherlands. Louis XIV tried to undermine this strategy by refusing to recognize William as king of England, and by giving diplomatic, military and financial support to a series of pretenders to the English throne, all based in France. William focused most of his attention on foreign policy and foreign wars, spending a great deal of time in the Netherlands (where he continued to hold the dominant political office). His closest foreign-policy advisers were Dutch, most notably William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland; they shared little information with their English counterparts.David Onnekink, \\"‘Mynheer Benting now rules over us’: the 1st Earl of Portland and the Re-emergence of the English Favourite, 1689–99.\\" English Historical Review 121.492 (2006): 693–713. online The net result was that the Netherlands remained independent, and France never took control of the Spanish Netherlands. The wars were very expensive to both sides but inconclusive. William died just as the continuation war, the War of the Spanish Succession, (1702–1714), was beginning. It was fought out during the reign of Queen Anne, and ended in a draw.For summaries of foreign policy see J.R. Jones, Country and Court: England, 1658–1714 (1979), pp 279–90; Geoffrey Holmes, The Making of a Great Power: Late Stuart and Early Georgian Britain, 1660–1722 (1993), pp 243–50, 434–39; Julian Hoppit, A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727 (2002), pp 89–166; and for greater detail, Stephen B.

The long 18th century: wars with France, 1702–1815 =Diplomatic service= Unlike such major rivals as France, the Netherlands, Sweden or Austria, British control over their own diplomacy was erratic. Diplomats were poorly selected, poorly funded, and non-professional. The main posts were Paris and The Hague, but the diplomats sent there were more clever in dealing with London politics than they were with diplomatic affairs. King William III handle foreign policy himself, using Dutch diplomats whenever possible. After 1700, Britain built up the quantity of its diplomatic service in the major capitals, without much attention to quality. Vienna and Berlin were upgraded, but even they were ignored for years at a time. By the 1790s, British diplomats had learned a great deal by closely watching their French rivals; aristocratic exiles from Paris began helping out as well. For the first time in the French wars, Britain set up an underground intelligence service that was in contact with local dissidents, and helped shape their protests.Elizabeth Sparrow, \\"Secret Service under Pitt's Administrations, 1792–1806.\\" History 83.270 (1998): 280–294. William Pitt the Younger, the Prime Minister during much of the French Revolutionary period, was saddled with the largely incompetent Foreign Secretary, Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, from 1783 to 1791. However Pitt managed to bring in numerous strong diplomats, such as James Harris at The Hague, where he forged an alliance that with the addition of Prussia became a triple alliance in 1788. Pitt often used him as a troubleshooter in complex negotiations.H. M. Scott, \\"Harris, James, first earl of Malmesbury (1746–1820)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 19 Aug 2016 Pitt brought in William Eden (1744–1814), who negotiated a difficult commercial treaty with France in 1786.Stephen M. Lee, ‘Eden, William, first Baron Auckland (1744–1814)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 accessed 19 Aug 2016 Pitt brought on board three foreign ministers with strong reputations. William Grenville (1791–1801) saw France as a profound threat to every nation in Europe, and he focused his attention on its defeat, working closely with his cousin PM Pitt. George Canning (1807–9), and Viscount Casterleagh (1812–15) were highly successful in organizing complex coalitions that in the end defeated Napoleon.Graham Goodlad, \\"From Castlereagh to Canning: Continuity and Change in British Foreign Policy,\\" History Today (2008) 10–15 Castlereagh to Canning displayed imagination and energy, although their personalities clashed to the point of fighting a duel.J.R. Jones, Britain and the World, 1649–1815 (Fontana, 1980) pp 38–48. = Britain as a naval and maritime power = Britain's leaders realized the value of the increasingly powerful Royal Navy, and made sure that in various treaties it added naval bases and obtained access to key ports.Martin Robson, A History of the Royal Navy: The Seven Years War (2015). In the Mediterranean region, it controlled Gibraltar and Minorca, and had advantageous positions in Naples and Palermo. The alliance with Portugal concluded in 1703 protected its approaches to the Mediterranean. In the North, Hanover played a role (it was ruled by the English king), while the alliance with Denmark provided naval access to the North Sea and the Baltic. Meanwhile, French maritime power was weakened by the Treaty of Utrecht which forced it to destroy its naval base in Dunkirk. English maritime power was boosted by a series of commercial treaties, including those of 1703 with Portugal, with the Netherlands, Savoy, Spain and France in 1713. Although the merchants of London had little direct say at the royal court, the king appreciated their contribution to the wealth of his kingdom, and to his tax base.J.O. Lindsay, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History vol. 7, The Old Regime: 1713–63 (1957) p 192.Walter E. Minchinton, The growth of English overseas trade in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (1969).Nuala Zahedieh, The Capital and the Colonies: London and the Atlantic Economy 1660–1700 (2010). =1701–1712 – War of the Spanish Succession= Queen Anne (1665–1714) Britain was a player in the first world war of modern times with theatres of fighting in Spain, Italy, Germany, Holland, and at sea.Clark, The Later Stuarts, 1660–1714 (1956) pp 200–238. At issue was the threat of a French-sponsored Bourbon heir as king of Spain, that would allow the Bourbon kings of France to take control of Spain and its American empire. John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722) Queen Anne was in charge, but she relied on an experienced team of experts, generals, diplomats, cabinet members, and War Office officials—most notably her most successful general John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.John B. Hattendorf, \\"English Governmental Machinery and the Conduct of War, 1702–1713.\\" War & Society 3.2 (1985): 1–22. He is best known for his great victory at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704. In 1706 he defeated the French at the Battle of Ramillies, captured their garrisons, and drove the French out of most of the Spanish Netherlands. The Royal Navy with an assist from the Dutch in 1704-5 captured Gibraltar, which ever since has been for the key to British power in the Mediterranean.Arnold Blumberg, \\"Grabbing and Holding 'the Rock'.\\" Naval History 26#6 (2012): 54+ The war dragged on and on, and neither France nor England could afford the mounting expenses, so a compromise solution was finally reached in the Treaty of Utrecht that protected most of England's interests; the French abandoned their long-term claim that the Old Pretender (the Catholic son of James II by his second marriage) was the true King of England.J. R. Jones, Britain and the World, 1649–1815 (1980) pp 149–78. Utrecht marked the end of French ambitions of hegemony in Europe expressed in the wars of Louis XIV, and preserved the European system based on the balance of power.R.R. Palmer, A History of the Modern World 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.John B. Hattendorf, England in the War of the Spanish Succession: A Study of the English View & Conduct of Grand Strategy, 1702–1712 (1987) British historian G. M. Trevelyan argues: England resolved its long-standing problem with Scotland in the Acts of Union 1707, which integrated Scotland into the British political and economic system. The much smaller Scotland kept its traditional political elite, its established Presbyterian church, its superior universities, and its distinctive legal system. The War of the Spanish Succession had again emphasized the danger of an independent Scotland in alliance with France as the dagger aimed at England. Awareness of the danger had helped to determine the timing, manner and consequences of union, and Scots began to play major roles in British intellectual life, and in providing diplomats, merchants, and soldiers for the emerging British Empire.Christopher Storrs, \\"Chapter 2 The Union of 1707 and the War of the Spanish Succession.\\" Scottish Historical Review 87.2 (suppl (2008): 31–44 online =1742–48, – War of the Austrian Succession= George II leading his troops at Dettingen, the last occasion on which a British King led his troops into battle Britain played a small role in the inconclusive but hard fought war that convulsed central Europe, while funding its ally Austria.Basil Williams and C.H. Stuart, The Whig Supremacy, 1714–1760 (1962) ch 9 The goal, as defined by foreign minister John Carteret was to limit the growth of French power, and protect Hanover, which was also ruled by King George II.Basil Williams, Carteret and Newcastle. A Contrast in Contemporaries (1943). In 1743 King George II led a 40,000-man British-Dutch-German army into the Rhine Valley. He was outmaneuvred by the French but he scored a narrow victory at the Battle of Dettingen. In the winter of 1743–44 the French planned to invade Britain in alliance with the Stuart pretender to George's throne; they were foiled by the Royal Navy. King George gave command to his son the Duke of Cumberland. He fared poorly and Britain pulled out of the war to deal with rebellion at home, where Cumberland gained fame by decisively suppressing the Jacobite Rising at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.M.S. Anderson, The War of Austrian Succession 1740–1748 (1995) excerpt Meanwhile, Britain did much better in North America, capturing the powerful Fortress of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) favoured France, which won the most victories. Britain returned the Fortress of Louisbourg to France and the French left the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). Prussia and Savoy were the main winners, and Britain's ally Austria was a loser. The treaty left the main issues of control over territories in America and India unresolved, and was little more than an armed truce, and a prelude to the more important Seven Years' War.Williams, The Whig Supremacy 1714–1760 (1965) pp 264–70. =1754–63 – Seven Years' War= The new alliances formed as a result of the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756; Austria switched from a British ally to a French ally; Prussia became a British ally.D.B. Horn, \\"The Diplomatic Revolution\\" in J.O. Lindsay, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History vol. 7, The Old Regime: 1713–63 (1763): pp 449–64. The Seven Years' War (1756–63 in Europe, 1754–63 in North America) was a major international conflict centered in Europe but reaching across the globe. Great Britain and Prussia were the winners. They fought France, Austria, Spain and Russia—nearly all of the other important powers except the Ottoman Empire). The Royal Navy played a major role, and the army and the Treasury played important roles. The war appeared to be a disaster for Prussia, until its fortunes reversed at the last second. Britain swept up much of the overseas French Empire in North America and India. The financing of war was a critical issue, which Britain handled well, and France handled poorly, leaving itself so deep in debt. That it never fully recovered. William Pitt (1708–78) energized the British leadership, and used effective diplomacy and military strategy to achieve his victory. Britain used the manpower from its American colonies effectively in cooperation with its regulars and its Navy to overwhelm the much less populous French colonial empire in what is now Canada. From a small spark in 1754 in the distant wilderness (near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), the fighting spread to Europe. 1759, was the \\"annus mirabilis\\" (\\"miraculous year\\"), with victory after victory. British and Prussian troops defeated the French army at the Battle of Minden, the British captured Guadeloupe Island and Quebec, smashed the French fleet at Quiberon Bay, and (in January 1760) defeated the French in southern India.Frank McLynn, 1759: The Year Britain Became Master of the World (2006) Peace terms were hard to reach and the war dragged on until everyone was exhausted. The British national debt soared to £134 million from £72 million, but London had a financial system capable of handling the burden. A debate erupted at the peace conference over whether Britain should keep the French colony of \\"New France\\" (now Canada) or Guadeloupe, both of which it had seized in the war. France wanted the rich sugar island as its world vision turned to maritime and tropical interests. Meanwhile, Britain was moving from commercial and maritime regulation to the assertion of territorial control over its colonies. So Britain kept the vast stretches of uneconomical Canada and France kept the rich little island.Helen Dewar, \\"Canada or Guadeloupe?: French and British Perceptions of Empire, 1760–1763.\\" Canadian Historical Review 91#4 (2010): 637–660. =1775–83 – American War of Independence= Neutrals Britain's diplomacy failed in the war—it had support of only a few small German states that hired out mercenaries. Most of Europe was officially neutral, but the elites and public opinion typically favoured the underdog American Patriots as in Sweden,H. A. Barton, \\"Sweden and the War of American Independence,\\" William and Mary Quarterly (1966) 23#2 pp. 408–430 in JSTOR and Denmark.Robert Rinehart, \\"Denmark Gets the News of '76,\\" Scandinavian Review (1976) 63#2 pp 5–14 The League of Armed Neutrality was an alliance of minor European naval powers between 1780 and 1783 which was intended to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy's wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband.Paul W. Mapp, \\"The Revolutionary War and Europe’s Great Powers.\\" in Edward G. Gray and Jane Kamensky, eds., The Oxford Handbook of the American Revolution (2013): pp 311–26. Empress Catherine II of Russia began the League in 1780. She endorsed the right of neutral countries to trade by sea with nationals of belligerent countries without hindrance, except in weapons and military supplies. The League would not recognize supposed blockades of whole coasts, but only of individual ports, and then only if a British warship was actually present. Denmark and Sweden agreed with Russia and the three countries signed the agreement forming the League. They remained otherwise out of the war, but threatened joint retaliation for every ship of theirs searched by a belligerent. By the end of the war in 1783 Prussia, the Holy Roman Empire, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Ottoman Empire had all become members. The League never fought a battle. Diplomatically, it carried greater weight; France and the United States of America were quick to proclaim their adherence to the new principle of free neutral commerce. Britain—which did not—still had no wish to antagonize Russia, and avoided interfering with the allies' shipping. While both sides of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War tacitly understood it as an attempt to keep the Netherlands out of the League, Britain did not officially regard the alliance as hostile. =William Pitt the Younger= As Prime Minister (1783-1801, 1804-1806) William Pitt the Younger, despite his youth, reinvigorated the administrative system of Great Britain, modernized its finances, and led the way in breaking out of the diplomatic isolation, it found itself during the American war. Beginning in 1793, he led the British nation in its mortal combat with the French Revolution and Napoleon. Warfare and finance From 1700 to 1850, Britain was involved in 137 wars or rebellions. It maintained a relatively large and expensive Royal Navy, along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in government financing from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes and, after 1790, an income tax.John Brewer, The Sinews of Power: War, Money and the English State, 1688–1783 (1990) Working with bankers in the City, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.Robert M. Kozub, \\"Evolution of Taxation in England, 1700–1850: A Period of War and Industrialization,\\" Journal of European Economic History, (2003), Vol. 32 Issue 2, pp 363–88Paul Kennedy, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers (1989) pp 80–84 Pitt in the 1780s reformed the fiscal system by raising taxes, monitoring expenses closely, and establishing a sinking fund to pay off the long-term debt, which amounted to £243 million, with annual interest accounting for most of the budget. Meanwhile, the banking system used its ownership of the debt to provide capital assets for economic growth.John Ehrmanm, The Younger Pitt: The Years of Acclaim (1969) [vol 1] pp 239-81. When the wars with France began, the debt reached £359 million in 1797 and Pitt kept the sinking fund in operation and raised taxes, especially on luxury items. Britain was far ahead of France and all other powers in its use of finance to strengthen the economy, the military and foreign policy.Richard Cooper, \\"William Pitt, Taxation, and the Needs of War.\\" Journal of British Studies 22#1 (1982): 94–103. in JSTOR =Nootka crisis with Spain, 1789–1795= The Nootka Crisis was a crisis with Spain starting in 1789 at Nootka Sound, an unsettled area at the time that is now part of British Columbia, Canada.John Ehrman, The Younger Pitt: The Years of Acclaim (1969) [vol 1] pp 554–71. Spain seized small British commercial ships engaged in the fur trade in an area on the Pacific on an area on the Pacific Coast. Spain claimed ownership based on a papal decree of 1493 that Spain said gave it control of the entire Pacific Ocean. Britain rejected the Spanish claims and used its greatly superior naval power to threaten a war and win the dispute.John Holland Rose, William Pitt and national revival (1911) pp 562–88. Spain, a rapidly fading military power, was unable to depend upon its longtime ally France, which was torn by internal revolution. The dispute was settled by negotiations in 1792–94, which became friendly when Spain switched sides in 1792 and became an ally of Britain against France. Spain surrendered to Britain many of its trade and territorial claims in the Pacific, ending a two- hundred-year monopoly on Asian-Pacific trade. The outcome was a victory for mercantile interests of BritainNootka Sound Controversy, The Canadian Encyclopedia and opened the way to British expansion in the Pacific. =Crisis with Russia 1791= Pitt was alarmed at Russian expansion in Crimea in the 1780s at the expense of his Ottoman ally, and tried to get Parliamentary support for reversing it.John Holland Rose, William Pitt and national revival (1911) pp 589–607. In peace talks with the Ottomans, Russia refused to return the key Ochakov fortress. Pitt wanted to threaten military retaliation. However Russia's ambassador Semyon Vorontsov swayed Pitt's enemies and launched a successful public opinion campaign. Pitt won the vote so narrowly that he gave up and Vorontsov secured a renewal of the commercial treaty between Britain and Russia.John Ehrman, The Younger Pitt: The Reluctant Transition (1996) [vol 2] pp 3-41. =French Revolutionary Wars 1792-1803= *1793 – 1802- French Revolutionary Wars No conclusive winner.William R. Nester, Titan: The Art of British Power in the Age of Revolution and Napoleon (2016). *1802 – Treaty of Amiens War resumed in 1803 after a one-year truce. The French Revolution, broke out in 1789 and polarized British political opinion, with the dominant conservatives outraged at killing of the king, the expulsion of the nobles, and the Reign of Terror. Britain was at war against France almost continuously from 1793 until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. The goal was to stop the spread of revolutionary and democratic ideas, and to prevent France from controlling Western Europe.Phillip Schofield, \\"British Politicians and French Arms: The Ideological War of 1793–1795.\\" History 77#250 (1992): 183–201. William Pitt the Younger was the dominant leader until his death in 1806. Pitt's strategy was to mobilize and fund the coalition against France. It seemed too hard to attack France on the continent so Pitt decided to seize France's valuable colonies in the West Indies and India.Edward Ingram, \\"Where and for what shall we fight?.\\" International History Review 7#.2 (1985): 271–276. At home, a minority pro-French element carried little weight with the British government. Conservatives castigated every radical opinion as \\"Jacobin\\" (in reference to the leaders of the Terror), warning that radicalism threatened an upheaval of British society.Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ed. The Encyclopedia of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History (2006) vol 1 pp 41–42, 88–93 * 1791–92: London rejects intervention in French Revolution. Its policy is based on realism not ideology and seek to avoid French attacks on the Austrian Netherlands; to not worsen the fragile status of King Louis XVI; and to prevent formation of a strong Continental league.Jeremy Black, \\"From Pillnitz to Valmy: British Foreign Policy and Revolutionary France 1791–1792\\", Francia: Part 2 Fruhe Neuzeit (1994) 21#2 pp 129–146 *1792–97: War of the First Coalition: Prussia and Austria joined after 1793 by Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Sardinia, Naples, and Tuscany against French Republic. * 1792: Austria and Prussia invade France.

His caricatures ridiculing Napoleon greatly annoyed the Frenchman, who wanted them suppressed by the British government.Andrew Roberts, Napoleon: A Life (2014) p 316 Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803. The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's reordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.Frederick Kagan, The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801–1805 (2007) pp 42–43 Britain had a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. Frank McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \\"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses – an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\\" McLynn concludes that in the long run it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon's intentions were hostile to the British national interest. Napoleon was not ready for war and so this was the best time for Britain to stop them. Britain seized upon the Malta issue, refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens and evacuate the island.Roberts, Napoleon: A Life (2014) p 309 The deeper British grievance was their perception that Napoleon was taking personal control of Europe, making the international system unstable, and forcing Britain to the sidelines.John D. Grainger, Amiens Truce: Britain & Bonaparte, 1801–1803 (2004) has a well-balanced analysis of both sidesArthur Bryant, Years of victory: 1802–1812 (1944), pp 1–52, although older, is a well-regarded interpretation from the British perspectiveKagan, The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801–1805 (2007) pp 1–50 stresses Napoleon's initiatives.Paul Schroeder, The Transformation of European politics 1763–1848 (1994) pp 231–45 is highly analytical and hostile to Napoleon Historian G. M. Trevelyan argues that British diplomacy under Lord Castlereagh played a decisive role: :In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour or character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned. * 1803: Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) against FranceSee Arthur Bryant, Years of Victory, 1802–1812 (1944) for British perspective *1803–06: War of the Third Coalition: Napoleon terminates the Holy Roman Empire. * 1803: By the Anglo-Russian agreement, Britain pays a subsidy of ₤1.5 million pounds for every 100,000 Russian soldiers in the field.

That freedom found its institutional expression in Parliament, the law, property, and rights, all of which were exported throughout the British Atlantic world. Such freedom also allowed the British, uniquely, to combine the classically incompatible ideals of liberty and empire. Britain, with its global empire, powerful Navy, leading industrial base, and unmatched financial and trade networks, dominated diplomacy in Europe and the world in the largely peaceful century 1814–1914. Five men stand out for their leadership in foreign policy: Lord Palmerston, Lord Aberdeen, Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone and Lord Salisbury. Military action was much less important than diplomacy. British military interventions in 1815–50 included opening up markets in Latin America (as in Argentina),David McLean, War, Diplomacy and Informal Empire: Britain and the Republics of La Plata, 1836–1853 (1995) opening the China market,Glenn Melancon, Britain's China Policy and the Opium Crisis: Balancing Drugs, Violence and National Honour, 1833–1840 (2003). responding to humanitarians by sending the Royal Navy to shut down the slave trade,Chaim D.

As foreign secretary (1830-4, 1835–41 and 1846–51) and subsequently as prime minister, Palmerston sought to maintain the balance of power in Europe, sometimes opposing France and at other times aligning with France to do so.Roman Golicz, \\"Napoleon III, Lord Palmerston and the Entente Cordiale.\\" History Today 50#12 (2000): 10–17 online.David Brown, \\"Palmerston and Anglo–French Relations, 1846–1865.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 17.4 (2006): 675–692 Thus he was aligned with France in the Crimean War against Russia, fought and won with the limited goal of protecting the Ottoman Empire. Some of his aggressive actions, now sometimes termed liberal interventionist, were highly controversial at the time, and remain so today. For example, he used military force to achieve his main goal of opening China to trade, although his critics focused on his support for the opium trade. In all his actions Palmerston brought to bear a great deal of patriotic vigour and energy. This made him very popular among the ordinary people of Britain, but his passion, propensity to act through personal animosity, and imperious language made him seem dangerous and destabilising in the eyes of the Queen and his more conservative colleagues in government.Jasper Ridley, Lord Palmerston (1971)Dick Leonard, Dick, \\"Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston—Master Diplomat or Playground Bully?.\\" in Dick Leonard, ed., Nineteenth-Century British Premiers (Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2008). pp 245–265.David Brown, Palmerston & the Politics of Foreign Policy 1846–55 (2002). He was an innovative administrator who devised ways to enhance his control of his department and build up his reputation. He controlled all communication within the Foreign Office and to other officials. He leaked secrets to the press, published selected documents, and released letters to give himself more control.John K. Derden, \\"The British Foreign Office and Policy Formation: The 1840s,\\" Proceedings & Papers of the Georgia Association of Historians (1981) pp 64–79. Aberdeen Lord Aberdeen (1784-1860) was a highly successful diplomat in many controversies from 1812 to 1856, but failed badly in handling the Crimean War and retired in 1856.Samuel J. Butcher, \\"Lord Aberdeen and Conservative Foreign Policy, 1841-1846\\" (PhD Diss. University of East Anglia, 2015) online. In 1813-1814 as ambassador to the Austrian Empire he negotiated the alliances and financing that led to the defeat of Napoleon. In Paris he normalized relations with the newly restored Bourbon government and convinced London they could be trusted. He worked well with top European diplomats such as his friends Klemens von Metternich in Vienna and François Guizot in Paris. He brought Britain into the center of Continental diplomacy on critical issues, such as the local wars in Greece, Portugal and Belgium. Simmering troubles with the United States were ended by compromising the border dispute in Maine that gave most of the land to the Americans but gave Canada critically important links to a warm water port.Wilbur Devereux Jones, \\"Lord Ashburton and the Maine Boundary Negotiations.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 40.3 (1953): 477-490. He played a central role in winning the Opium Wars against China, gaining control of Hong Kong in the process.Robert Eccleshall and Graham S. Walker, eds. Biographical dictionary of British prime ministers (1998) pp. 167-74.R.W. Seton-Watson, Britain in Europe: 1789-1914 (1937) pp 129-48, 223-41, 688. Disraeli Benjamin Disraeli, the Conservative leader for much of the late 19th century, built up the British Empire and played a major role in European diplomacy. Disraeli's second term (1874–1880) was dominated by the Eastern Question—the slow decay of the Ottoman Empire and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the Suez Canal Company (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the Congress of Berlin to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen. World events thereafter moved against the Conservatives. Controversial wars in Afghanistan and South Africa undermined Disraeli's public support.Martin Swartz, The Politics of British Foreign Policy in the Era of Disraeli and Gladstone (1985). Gladstone William Ewart Gladstone (Prime Minister 1868–74, 1880–85, 1886, 1892–94), the Liberal leader, was much less inclined to imperialism and sought peace as the highest foreign policy goal. However, historians have been sharply critical of Gladstone's foreign-policy during his second ministry. Paul Hayes says it \\"provides one of the most intriguing and perplexing tales of muddle and incompetence in foreign affairs, unsurpassed in modern political history until the days of Grey and, later, Neville Chamberlain.\\"Paul Hayes, Modern British Foreign Policy: The Twentieth Century: 1880–1939 (1978) p 1 Gladstone opposed himself to the \\"colonial lobby\\" which pushed the scramble for Africa. His term saw the end of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, First Boer War and the war against the Mahdi in Sudan.Paul Knaplund, Gladstone's foreign policy (1970). Salisbury Historians largely agree that Lord Salisbury as foreign minister (1878–80, 1885–86, 1887–92, and 1895–1900) and prime minister (1885-6, 1886–92, 1895–1902) was a strong and effective leader in foreign affairs. Historians in the late 20th century rejected the older view that Salisbury pursued a policy of 'splendid isolation'.Keith M. Wilson, ed., British foreign secretaries and foreign policy: from Crimean War to First World War (1987). He had a superb grasp of the issues, and proved: :a patient, pragmatic practitioner, with a keen understanding of Britain's historic interests....He oversaw the partition of Africa, the emergence of Germany and the United States as imperial powers, and the transfer of British attention from the Dardanelles to Suez without provoking a serious confrontation of the great powers.Nancy W. Ellenberger, \\"Salisbury\\" in David Loades, ed. Reader's Guide to British History (2003) 2:1154 =Free trade imperialism= The Great Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry, which was to last until the rise of Germany and the United States in the 1890s.Jeffrey A. Auerbach, The Great Exhibition of 1851: a nation on display (1999). Using the imperial tools of free trade and financial investment,Bernard Semmel, The Rise of Free Trade Imperialism (Cambridge University Press, 1970) ch 1 it exerted major influence on many countries outside Europe, especially in Latin America and Asia. Thus Britain had both a formal Empire based on British rule and an informal one based on the British pound.David McLean, \\"Finance and \\"Informal Empire\\" before the First World War,\\" Economic History Review (1976) 29#2 pp 291–305 in JSTOR. =Latin America= The independence of Latin American countries after 1826, opened lucrative prospects for London financiers. The region was gravely devastated by the wars of independence, and with weak financial systems, weak governments and repeated coups and internal rebellions. However, the region had a well- developed export sector focused on the foods that were in demand in Europe, especially sugar, coffee, wheat and (after the arrival of refrigeration in the 1860s), beef. There also was a well-developed mining sector. With the Spanish out of the picture, the region in the early 1820s was a devastated region suffering in a deep depression. It urgently needed capital, entrepreneurs, financiers, and shippers. Britain rushed in to fill the void by the middle 1820s, as the London government use its diplomatic power to encourage large- scale investment. The Royal Navy provided protection against piracy. The British established communities of merchants in major cities—including 3000 Britons in Buenos Aires.R.A. Humphreys, \\"British Merchants and South American Independence,\\" Proceedings of the British Academy (1965), Vol. 51, pp151-174 online. London financiers purchased £17 million in Latin American government bonds, especially those of Argentina, Chile, Peru and Mexico. They invested another £35 million in 46 stock companies set up to operate primarily in Latin America. The bubble soon burst, but the survivors operated quietly and profitably for many decades. In the 1820s–1850s, over 260 British merchant houses operated in the River Plate or Chile, and hundreds more in the rest of Latin America.J.F. Rippy, The Evolution of international Business 1800–1945: vol 1: British Investments in Latin America, 1822–1949 (1949) p 17.Manuel Llorca-Jaña, \\"The organisation of British textile exports to the River Plate and Chile: Merchant houses in operation, c. 1810–59.\\" Business History 53#6 (2011): 821–865. The Latin American market was important for the cotton manufacturers of Lancashire. They supported the independence movement, and persuaded the British government to station commercial consuls in all the major trading centers in Latin America. The British were permanently committed, and it took decades – until the 1860s – before the commercial and involvement paid serious dividends. By 1875, Latin America was firmly integrated into transatlantic economy under British leadership. After 1898, the British had to compete commercially with the Americans.Ronald Hyam, Britain's Imperial Century 1815–1914 (2002) pp 57–61 In long-term perspective, Britain's influence in Latin America was enormous after independence came in the 1820s. Britain deliberately sought to replace the Spanish in economic and cultural affairs. Military issues and colonization were minor factors. The influence was exerted through diplomacy, trade, banking, and investment in railways and mines. The English language and British cultural norms were transmitted by energetic young British business agents on temporary assignment in the major commercial centers, where they invited locals into the British leisure activities, such as organized sports, and into their transplanted cultural institutions such as clubs and schools.Alina Silveira, \\"Educating a City's Children: British Immigrants and Primary Education in Buenos Aires (1820–1880).\\" The Americas 70#1 (2013): 33–62. The impact on sports was overwhelming, as Latin America enthusiastically took up football (soccer). In Argentina, rugby, polo, tennis and golf became important in middle-class leisure. Cricket was ignored. The British role never disappeared, but it faded rapidly after 1914 as the British cashed in their investments to pay for their Great War, and the United States moved into the region with overwhelming force and similar cultural norms.Oliver Marshall, ed. English-Speaking Communities in Latin America (2000). There were no actual wars directly involving Britain, however there were several confrontations. The most serious came in 1845–1850 when British and French navies blockaded Buenos Aires in order to protect the independence of Uruguay from Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of Argentina. Other lesser controversies with Argentina broke out in 1833, with Guatemala in 1859, Mexico in 1861, Nicaragua in 1894, and Venezuela in 1895 and 1902. There also was tension along the Mosquito Coast in Central America in the 1830s and 1840s.Michael Rheta Martin and Gabriel H. Lovett, Encyclopedia of Latin- American History (1968) p 17. =Relations with the United States= Relations with the United States were often strained, and even verged on war when Britain almost supported the Confederacy in the early part of the American Civil War. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in Oregon boundary dispute in 1844–46. However British middle class public opinion sensed a common \\"Special Relationship\\" between the two peoples based on language, migration, evangelical Protestantism, liberal traditions, and extensive trade. This constituency rejected war, forcing London to appease the Americans. During the Trent affair of late 1861, London drew the line and Washington retreated.George L. Bernstein, \\"Special Relationship and Appeasement: Liberal policy towards America in the age of Palmerston.\\" Historical Journal 41#3 (1998): 725–750. British public opinion was divided on the American Civil War. The Confederacy tended to have support from the elites—from the aristocracy and gentry, which identified with the landed plantation owners, and from Anglican clergy and some professionals who admired tradition, hierarchy and paternalism. The Union was favored by the middle classes, the Nonconformists in religion, intellectuals, reformers and most factory workers, who saw slavery and forced labor as a threat to the status of the workingman. The cabinet made the decisions. Chancellor of the Exchequer William E Gladstone, whose family fortune was based on slave plantations in the West Indies, supported the Confederacy. Foreign Minister Lord Russell wanted neutrality. Prime Minister Lord Palmerston wavered between support for national independence, his opposition to slavery, and the strong economic advantages of Britain remaining neutral.Geoffrey Wheatcroft, \\"How the British Nearly Supported the Confederacy,\\" New York Times Sunday Book Review June 30, 2011 online Britain supplied warships and blockade runners to the Confederacy, but had a large scale trade with the United States and many British men volunteered to fight for the North. Northern food supplies were much more essential to Britain than Southern cotton.Howard Jones, Blue & Gray Diplomacy: A History of Union and Confederate Foreign Relations (2010). After the war, the US demanded reparations (called the Alabama Claims) for the damages caused by the warships. After arbitration the British paid the U.S. $15.5 million in 1872 and peaceful relations resumed.Adrian Cook, The Alabama Claims: American Politics and Anglo-American Relations, 1865–1872 (1975). =Relations with the Ottoman Empire= As the 19th century progressed the Ottoman Empire grew weaker and Britain increasingly became its protector, even fighting the Crimean War in the 1850s to help it out against Russia.Frank E. Bailey, \\"The Economics of British Foreign Policy, 1825-50.\\" Journal of Modern History 12.4 (1940): 449-484 online. Three British leaders played major roles. Lord Palmerston in the 1830–65 era considered the Ottoman Empire an essential component in the balance of power, was the most favourable toward Constantinople. William Gladstone in the 1870s sought to build a Concert of Europe that would support the survival of the empire. In the 1880s and 1890s Lord Salisbury contemplated an orderly dismemberment of it, in such a way as to reduce rivalry between the greater powers.David Steele, \\"Three British Prime Ministers and the Survival of the Ottoman Empire, 1855–1902.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 50.1 (2014): 43–60. Crimean War 1854–56 The Crimean War (1854–56) was fought between Russia on the one hand and an alliance of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire on the other. Russia was defeated but the casualties were very heavy on all sides, and historians look at the entire episode as a series of blunders.A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848–1918 (1954) pp 62–82A.J.P. Taylor, \\"The war that would not boil,\\" History Today (1951) 1#2 pp 23–31. The war began with Russian demands to protect Christian sites in the Holy Land. The churches quickly settled that problem, but it escalated out of hand as Russia put continuous pressure on the Ottomans. Diplomatic efforts failed. The Sultan declared war against Russia in October 1851. Following an Ottoman naval disaster in November, Britain and France declared war against Russia.Kingsley Martin, The triumph of Lord Palmerston: a study of public opinion in England before the Crimean War (Hutchinson, 1963). online It proved quite difficult to reach Russian territory, and the Royal Navy could not defeat the Russian defences in the Baltic. Most of the battles took place in the Crimean peninsula, which the Allies finally seized. London, shocked to discover that France was secretly negotiating with Russia to form a postwar alliance to dominate Europe, dropped its plans to attack St. Petersburg and instead signed a one-sided armistice with Russia that achieved almost none of its war aims. Diplomats at the Congress of Paris, 1856, settled the Crimean War; painting by Edouard Louis Dubufe. The Treaty of Paris signed March 30, 1856, ended the war. Russia gave up a little land and relinquished its claim to a protectorate over the Christians in the Ottoman domains. The Black Sea was demilitarized, and an international commission was set up to guarantee freedom of commerce and navigation on the Danube River. Moldavia and Wallachia remained under nominal Ottoman rule, but would be granted independent constitutions and national assemblies. However, by 1870, the Russians had regained most of their concessions.Harold Temperley, \\"The Treaty of Paris of 1856 and Its Execution,\\" Journal of Modern History (1932) 4#3 pp. 387–414 in JSTOR The war helped modernize warfare by introducing major new technologies such as railways, the telegraph, and modern nursing methods. In the long run the war marked a turning point in Russian domestic and foreign policy. Russian intellectuals used the defeat to demand fundamental reform of the government and social system. The war weakened both Russia and Austria, so they could no longer promote stability. This opened the way for Napoleon III, Cavour (in Italy) and Otto von Bismarck (in Germany) to launch a series of wars in the 1860s that reshaped Europe.Stephen J. Leem Aspects of European History 1789–1980 (2001) pp 67–74 Of the 91,000 British soldiers and sailors sent to Crimea, 21,000 died, 80 percent of them from disease. The losses were reported in detail in the media and caused revulsion against warfare in Britain, combined with a celebration of the heroic common soldier who demonstrated Christian virtue. The great heroine was Florence Nightingale, whose was hailed for her devotion to caring for the wounded and her emphasis on middle-class efficiency. She typified a moral status as a nurse that was superior to aristocratic militarism in terms of both morality and efficiency.Orlando Figes, The Crimean War: A History (2011) esp. pp 467–80. Historian R. B. McCallum points out the war was enthusiastically supported by the British populace as it was happening, but the mood changed very dramatically afterwards. Pacifists and critics were unpopular but: :in the end they won. Cobden and Bright were true to their principles of foreign policy, which laid down the absolute minimum of intervention in European affairs and a deep moral reprobation of war....When the first enthusiasm was passed, when the dead were mourned, the sufferings revealed, and the cost counted, when in 1870 Russia was able calmly to secure the revocation of the Treaty, which disarmed her in the Black Sea, the view became general of the war was stupid and unnecessary, and effected nothing....The Crimean war remained as a classic example...of how governments may plunge into war, how strong ambassadors may mislead weak prime ministers, how the public may be worked up into a facile fury, and how the achievements of the war may crumble to nothing. The Bright-Cobden criticism of the war was remembered and to a large extent accepted [especially by the Liberal Party]. Isolation from European entanglements seemed more than ever desirable.R.B. McCallum in Elie Halevy, The Victorian years: 1841–1895 (1951) p 426See also Orlando Figes, The Crimean War (2010) pp 467–80. Takeover of Egypt, 1882 The most decisive event emerged from the Anglo-Egyptian War, which resulted in the occupation of Egypt. although the Ottoman Empire was the nominal owner, in practice Britain made all the decisions. In 1914, Britain went to war with the Ottomans and ended their nominal role. Historian A. J. P. Taylor says that the seizure, which lasted seven decades, \\"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia and the Russo-Japanese war.\\"He adds, \\"All the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started. A.J.P. Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" in F.H. Hinsley, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History: XI: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870–98 (1962): 554. Taylor emphasizes long-term impact: :The British occupation of Egypt altered the balance of power. It not only gave the British security for their route to India; it made them masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East; it made it unnecessary for them to stand in the front line against Russia at the Straits....And thus prepared the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance ten years later.Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" p 554 1900–1914 After 1900 Britain ended its policy of \\"splendid isolation\\" by developing friendly relations with the United States and European powers – most notably France and Russia, in an alliance which fought the First World War. The \\"Special Relationship\\" with the United States starting about 1898 allowed Britain to largely relocate its naval forces out of the Western Hemisphere.Duncan Campbell, Unlikely Allies: Britain, America and the Victorian Origins of the Special Relationship (2007). Germany's Chancellor Bismarck had dominated European diplomacy 1872–1890, with the determination to use the balance of power to keep the peace. There were no wars. However he was removed by an aggressive young Kaiser in 1890, allowing French efforts to isolate Germany to become successful. Joseph Chamberlain, who played a major role in foreign policy in the late 1890s under the Salisbury government, repeatedly tried to open talks with Germany about some sort of an alliance. Germany was not interested.H.W. Koch, \\"The Anglo‐German Alliance Negotiations: Missed Opportunity or Myth?.\\" History 54#182 (1969): 378–392. Instead, Berlin felt itself increasingly surrounded by France, Russia, and perhaps.Samuel R. Williamson Jr., \\"German Perceptions of the Triple Entente after 1911: Their Mounting Apprehensions Reconsidered\\" Foreign Policy Analysis 7#2 (2011): 205–214. Meanwhile, Paris went to great pains to woo Russia and Great Britain. Key markers were the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894, the 1904 Entente Cordiale linking France and Great Britain, and finally the Anglo-Russian Entente in 1907 which became the Triple Entente. France thus had a formal alliance with Russia, and an informal alignment with Britain, against Germany.G.P. Gooch, Before the war: studies in diplomacy (1936), pp 87–186. By 1903 Britain had established good relations with the United States and Japan.A.J.P. Taylor, The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918 (1954) pp 345, 403–26 Britain abandoned the policy of holding aloof from the continental powers (\\"Splendid Isolation\\") in the 1900s after standing without friends during the Second Boer War (1899–1903). Britain concluded agreements, limited to colonial affairs, with her two major colonial rivals: the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907. Britain's alignment a reaction to an assertive German foreign policy and the buildup of its navy from 1898 which led to the Anglo-German naval arms race. British diplomat Arthur Nicolson argued it was \\"far more disadvantageous to us to have an unfriendly France and Russia than an unfriendly Germany\\".Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2014) p. 324 The impact of the Triple Entente was to improve British relations with France and its ally Russia and to demote the importance to Britain of good relations with Germany. After 1905, foreign policy was tightly controlled by the Liberal foreign minister Edward Grey (1862–1933), who seldom consulted the Cabinet. Grey shared the strong Liberal policy against all wars and against military alliances that would force Britain to take a side in war. However, in the case of the Boer War, Grey held that the Boers had committed an aggression that it was necessary to repulse. The Liberal party split on the issue, with a large faction strongly opposed to the war in AfricaKeith Robbins, \\"Grey, Edward, Viscount Grey of Fallodon (1862–1933)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, (2004; online edition, 2011) accessed 5 Nov 2017Denis Judd and Keith Surridge, The Boer War: A History (2nd ed. 2013), The Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia is often compared to the Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria–Hungary and Italy, but historians caution against the comparison. The Entente, in contrast to the Triple Alliance or the Franco- Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence and Britain therefore felt free to make her own foreign policy decisions in 1914. The Liberal party members were highly pacifistic and moralistic, and by 1914 they have been increasingly convinced that German aggression violated international norms, and specifically that a German invasion of neutral Belgium was completely immoral. However the all-Liberal British cabinet decided on July 29, 1914, that being a signatory to the 1839 treaty about Belgium did not obligate it to oppose a German invasion of Belgium with military force.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers (2012) p. 539. According to Isabel V. Hull : :Annika Mombauer correctly sums up the current historiography: \\"Few historians would still maintain that the 'rape of Belgium was the real motive for Britain's declaration of war on Germany.\\" Instead, the role of Belgian neutrality is variously interpreted as an excuse to mobilize the public, to provide embarrassed radicals in the cabinet with the justification for abandoning the principal pacifism and thus were staying in office, or in the more conspiratorial versions to cover for naked imperial interests. Isabel V. Hull, A Scrap of Paper: Breaking and Making International Law during the Great War (Cornell UP, 2014) p, 33 As war neared the cabinet agreed that German defeat of France and control and the continent of Europe was intolerable and would be a cause for war.K.A. Hamilton, \\"Great Britain and France, 1911–1914\\" in F. H. Hinsley, ed., British Foreign Policy Under Sir Edward Grey (1977) online p 34. =Naval race with Germany= The British Dreadnought (1906) made all battleships obsolete because it had ten long-range 12-inch big guns, mechanical computer-like range finders, high speed turbine engines that could make 21 knots, and armour plates 11 inches thick. After 1805 the dominance of Britain's Royal Navy was unchallenged; in the 1890s Germany decided to match it. Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849–1930) dominated German naval policy from 1897 until 1916.Michael Epkenhans, Tirpitz: Architect of the German High Seas Fleet (2008) excerpt and text search, pp 23–62 Before the German Empire formed in 1871, Prussia never had a real navy, nor did the other German states. Tirpitz turned the modest little fleet into a world-class force that could threaten the British Royal Navy. The British responded with new technology typified by the Dreadnought revolution. It made every battleship obsolete and, supplemented by the global network of coaling stations and telegraph cables, enabled Britain to stay well in the lead in naval affairs.Margaret Macmillan, The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 (2013) ch 5Thomas Hoerber, \\"Prevail or perish: Anglo-German naval competition at the beginning of the twentieth century,\\" European Security (2011) 20#1, pp. 65–79. abstract At about the same time Britain developed the use of fuel oil in warships instead of coal. The naval benefits of oil were significant, making ships cheaper to build and run, giving them greater range, and removing strategic limitations imposed by the need for frequent stops at coaling stations. Britain had plenty of coal but no oil, and it had relied on American and Dutch oil suppliers, so its foreign policy made it a high priority. At the prompting of Admiral John Fisher, this was addressed by Winston Churchill, beginning with the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines of 1912. Urgency was applied when it was learned that Germany was organising a supply of oil in the Middle East. Britain secured its own supplies through foreign policy and its 1914 purchase of a controlling, 51% stake in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, of which BP is successor. First World War Daily Mail on Aug 5 Besides providing soldiers and fleets, one of Britain's most important roles was financing the war, with large-scale loans and grants to France, Russia, Italy and others. It tried to stay on friendly relations with the United States, which sold large quantities of raw materials and food, and provided large- scale loans. Germany was so convinced that the United States as a neutral was playing a decisive role, that it began unrestricted submarine warfare against the United States, which it new it would lead to war in April 1917. The United States then took over Britain's financial role, loaning large sums to Britain, France, Russia, Italy and the others. The US demanded repayment after the war, but did negotiate better terms for Britain. Finally in 1931, all debt payments were suspended.Paul Hayes, Modern British foreign policy: The 20th century 1880 – 1939 (1978), pp. 177–222.Llewellyn Woodward, Great Britain and the War of 1914–1918 (1967) Interwar years 1919–1939 Britain had suffered little devastation during the war and Prime Minister David Lloyd George supported reparations to a lesser extent than the French did at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. Britain reluctantly supported the hard Treaty of Versailles, while the U.S, rejected it. France was the main sponsor in its quest for revenge. Vivid memories of the horrors and deaths of the World War made Britain and its leaders strongly inclined to pacifism in the interwar era.Michael Pugh, Liberal internationalism: the interwar movement for peace in Britain (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012). Britain was a \\"troubled giant\\" wielding much less influence than before. It often had to give way to the United States, which frequently exercised its financial superiority.F.S. Northedge, The troubled giant: Britain among the great powers, 1916–1939 (1966). The main themes of British foreign policy include a conciliatory role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, where Lloyd George worked hard to moderate French demands for revenge.Erik Goldstein, Winning the peace: British diplomatic strategy, peace planning, and the Paris Peace Conference, 1916–1920 (1991). He was partly successful, but Britain soon had to moderate French policy toward Germany, as in the Locarno Treaties.Frank Magee, \\"‘Limited Liability’? Britain and the Treaty of Locarno.\\" Twentieth Century British History 6.1 (1995): 1–22.Andrew Barros, \\"Disarmament as a weapon: Anglo-French relations and the problems of enforcing German disarmament, 1919–28.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 29#2 (2006): 301–321. Britain was an active member of the new League of Nations, but the League had few major achievements, none of which greatly affected Britain or its Empire.Peter J. Yearwood, Guarantee of Peace: The League of Nations in British Policy 1914–1925 (2009).Susan Pedersen, \\"Back to the League of Nations.\\" American Historical Review 112.4 (2007): 1091–1117. in JSTOR =Breakup of Ottoman Empire= The Sykes–Picot Agreement was a secret 1916 agreement between Great Britain and France, deciding how the possessions of the Ottoman Empire would be split up after its defeat. The agreement defined their mutually agreed spheres of influence and control in the Middle East. The agreement allocated to Britain control of areas roughly comprising the coastal strip between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, Jordan, southern Iraq, and an additional small area that included the ports of Haifa and Acre, to allow access to the Mediterranean.Text of the Sykes–Picot Agreement at the WWI Document Archive France got control of southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, Syria and Lebanon Russia was to get Constantinople, the Turkish Straits and Armenia. The controlling powers were left free to determine state boundaries within their areas. Further negotiation was expected to determine international administration pending consultations with Russia and other powers, including Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca.Paula Kitching, \\"The Sykes- Picot agreement and lines in the sand.\\" Historian 128 (2015): 18–23. The promises to Russia expired when it left the war. After the Ottoman defeat in 1918 the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire divided the Arab provinces outside the Arabian peninsula into areas of British and French control and influence. Britain ruled Mandatory Iraq from 1920 until 1932, while the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon lasted from 1923 to 1946.Peter Sluglett, Britain in Iraq: contriving king and country (IB Tauris, 2007). The British took control of Palestine in 1920 and ruled it as Mandatory Palestine from 1923 until 1948. However, the British in the Balfour Declaration of 1917 promised a Jewish zone of ambiguous status, which was unacceptable to the Arab leadership.Ian J. Bickerton and Carla L. Klausner, A concise history of the Arab-Israeli conflict (Prentice Hall, 2005). =Fall of Lloyd George= Lloyd George in 1922 A series of foreign policy crises gave Prime Minister David Lloyd George his last opportunity to hold national and international leadership. Everything went wrong.Inbal Rose, Conservatism and foreign policy during the Lloyd George coalition 1918–1922 (Routledge, 2014). The League of Nations, off to a slow start, was a huge let down from utopian dreams. The Treaty of Versailles had set up a series of temporary organizations, composed of delegations from key powers, to ensure the successful application of the Treaty. The system worked very poorly. The assembly of ambassadors was repeatedly overruled and became a nonentity. Most of the commissions were deeply divided and unable to either make decisions or convince the interested parties to carry them out. The most important commission was on Reparations, and France took full control of it. The new French prime minister Raymond Poincaré was intensely anti-German, was unrelenting in his demands for huge reparations, and was repeatedly challenged by Germany. France finally invaded parts of Germany, and Berlin responded by imposing a runaway inflation that seriously damage the German economy and also damaged the French economy. The United States, after refusing to ratify the League in 1920, almost completely disassociated itself from the League. In 1921, the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement successfully opened trade relations with Communist Russia. Lloyd George was unable to negotiate full diplomatic relations, as the Russians rejected all repayment of Tsarist era debts, and conservatives in Britain grew exceedingly wary of the communist threat to European stability. Lloyd George in 1922 set about to make himself master of peace in the world, especially through a world conference in Genoa that he expected would rival Paris of 1919 in visibility, and restore his reputation. Everything went wrong. Poincaré and the French demanded a military alliance that was far beyond what the British would accept. Germany and Russia made their own sweeping agreement at Rapallo, which wrecked the Genoa conference.Sally Marks, The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe, 1918–1933 (2nd ed. 2003) p. 45. Finally, Lloyd George decided to support Greece in a war against Turkey in the Chanak Crisis. It was yet another fiasco as all but two of the Dominions refused support and the British military was hesitant. The Conservatives rejected a war, with Bonar Law telling the nation, \\"We cannot act alone as the policeman of the world.\\" Greece lost its war and Lloyd George lost control of his coalition. He never again held major office.Michael Laird, \\"Wars Averted: Chanak 1922, Burma 1945–47, Berlin 1948,\\" Journal of Strategic Studies (1996) 19#3 pp 343-364. Internationally and especially at home, Lloyd George the hero of the world war had suddenly become a failed model.Kenneth O. Morgan, Consensus and Disunity: The Lloyd George Coalition Government 1918–1922 (1986) pp 302–30. =Naval disarmament and debts= Disarmament was high on the popular agenda, and Britain supported the leadership of United States in the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 in working toward naval disarmament of the major powers. Britain played a leading role in the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference and the 1930 London Conference that led to the London Naval Treaty. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and Russia to go along led to the meaningless Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. Disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany.Raymond G. O'Connor, \\"The\\" Yardstick\\" and Naval Disarmament in the 1920s.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 45.3 (1958): 441–463. in JSTORB. J. C. McKercher, \\"The politics of naval arms limitation in Britain in the 1920s.\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft 4#3 (1993): 35–59. Britain was less successful in negotiating with United States regarding the large wartime loans. The U.S. insisted on repayment of the full £978 million. It was agreed to in 1923 at the interest rate of 3% to 3.5% over 62 years.Mowat. Britain Between the Wars, p 161. Under Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald Britain took the lead in getting France to accept the American solution to reparations through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan, whereby Germany paid its reparations using money borrowed from New York banks.David Marquand, Ramsay MacDonald (1977) p 351.Patrick O. Cohrs, The unfinished peace after world war 1: America, Britain and the stabilization of Europe, 1919–1932 (2006). The Great Depression starting in 1929 put enormous pressure on the British economy. Britain move toward imperial preference, which meant low tariffs among the Commonwealth of Nations, and higher barriers toward trade with outside countries. The flow of money from New York dried up, and the system of reparations and payment of debt collapsed in 1931. The debts were renegotiated in the 1950s. =Seeking stability in Europe= Britain sought peace with Germany through the Locarno treaties of 1925. A main goal was to restore Germany to a peaceful, prosperous state.Frank Magee, \\"Limited Liability? Britain and the Treaty of Locarno\\", Twentieth Century British History, (1995) 6#1, pp. 1–22. The success at Locarno in handling the German question impelled Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain, working with France and Italy, to find a master solution to the diplomatic problems of Eastern Europe and the Balkans. It proved impossible to overcome mutual antagonisms, because Chamberlain's programme was flawed by his misperceptions and fallacious judgments.Dragan Bakić, \\"‘Must Will Peace’: The British Brokering of ‘Central European’ and ‘Balkan Locarno’, 1925–9.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 48.1 (2013): 24–56. online Britain thought disarmament was the key to peace. France, with its profound fear of German militarism, strenuously opposed the idea. In the early 1930s, most Britons saw France, not Germany, as the chief threat to peace and harmony in Europe. France did not suffer as severe an economic recession, and was the strongest military power, but still it refused British overtures for disarmament.Marquand, Ramsay MacDonald p 716. The Dominions (Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand) achieved virtual independence in foreign policy in 1931, though each depended heavily upon British naval protection. After 1931 trade policy favoured the Commonwealth with tariffs against the U.S. and others.Lorna Lloyd, \\"'Us and Them': The Changing Nature of Commonwealth Diplomacy, 1880–1973.\\" Commonwealth and Comparative Politics 39.3 (2001): 9–30. =Foreign policy in domestic politics= The Labour Party came to power in 1924 under Ramsay MacDonald, who served as party leader, prime minister and foreign secretary.Carolyn J. Kitching, \\"Prime minister and foreign secretary: the dual role of James Ramsay MacDonald in 1924.\\" Review of International Studies 37#3 (2011): 1403–1422. The party had a distinctive and foreign policy based on pacifism. It held that peace was impossible because of capitalism, secret diplomacy, and the trade in armaments.Henry R. Winkler, . \\"The Emergence of a Labor Foreign Policy in Great Britain, 1918–1929.\\" Journal of Modern History 28.3 (1956): 247–258. in JSTOR That is it stressed material factors that ignored the psychological memories of the Great War, and the highly emotional tensions regarding nationalism and the boundaries of the countries. Nevertheless, MacDonald overcame the ideological straitjacket and proved highly successful in managing foreign affairs. In 1929 the Americans gave him a ticker-tape parade in New York City.Robert F. Holland, The pursuit of greatness: Britain and the world role, 1900–1970 (1991) p 122.John Shepherd and Keith Laybourn, Britain's First Labour Government (2006) pp 130–60. The Zinoviev letter appeared during the 1924 general election and purported to be a directive from the Communist International in Moscow to the Communist Party of Great Britain. It said the resumption of diplomatic relations (by a Labour government) would hasten the radicalisation of the British working class. It was a forgery but it helped defeat Labour as the Conservatives scored a landslide.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars 1918–1940 (1955) 188-94 A.J.P. Taylor argues that the most important impact was on the psychology of Labourites, who for years blamed their defeat on foul play, thereby misunderstanding the political forces at work and postponing needed reforms in the Labour Party.A.J.P. Taylor English History 1914–1945 (1965) p. 219 MacDonald returned to power in 1929. There was little pacifism left. He strongly supported the League of Nations but he also felt that cohesion within the British Empire and a strong, independent British defence programme would be the best policy. =1930s= The challenge came from dictators, first Benito Mussolini of Italy from 1923, then from 1933 Adolf Hitler of a much more powerful Nazi Germany. Britain and France led the policy of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). The League of Nations proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \\"appease\\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. League-authorized sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Ethiopia had support in Britain but proved a failure and were dropped in 1936.James C. Robertson, \\"The Origins of British Opposition to Mussolini over Ethiopia.\\" Journal of British Studies 9#1 (1969): 122–142. Germany was the difficult case. By 1930 British leaders and intellectuals largely agreed that all major powers shared the blame for war in 1914, and not Germany alone as the Treaty of Versailles specified. Therefore, they believed the punitive harshness of the Treaty of Versailles was unwarranted, and this view, adopted by politicians and the public, was largely responsible for supporting appeasement policies down to 1938. That is, German rejections of treaty provisions seemed justified.Catherine Ann Cline, \\"British Historians and the Treaty of Versailles.\\" Albion 20#1 (1988): 43–58. =Coming of Second World War= By late 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The British military leaders warned that Germany would win a war, and Britain needed another year or two to catch up in terms of aviation and air defence. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed the border regions of Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the Munich Agreement of 1938.David Faber, Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II (2010) Hitler was not satiated and, in March 1939, seized all of Czechoslovakia and menaced Poland. At last Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland. Hitler however cut a deal with Joseph Stalin to divide Eastern Europe; when Germany did invade Poland in September 1939, Britain and France declared war; the British Commonwealth followed London's lead.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938–39 (1990) Second World War Since 1945 Despite the heavy American grants of Lend Lease food oil and munitions (which did not have to be repaid) plus American loans, and a grant of money and loans from Canada at the end of the war Britain was on the verge of bankruptcy. John Maynard Keynes argued the only solution was to drastically cut back the spending on the British Empire, which amounted to £2,000 million.Robert Skidelsky, John Maynard Keynes, Vol. 3: Fighting for Freedom, 1937-1946 (2001) pp 402–58. The postwar overseas deficit was £1,400 million, warned Keynes, and, \\"it is this expenditure which is wholly responsible for either financial difficulties.\\" Both Churchill and Attlee ignored his advice and kept spending heavily, in part by borrowing from India. The United States provided a £3,500 million 50-year loan in 1946 and sudden grant of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947 did solve much of the problem. Marshall Plan money began flowing in 1948, And by the time it ended in 1951 the financial crisis was over.John Bew, Clement Attlee: The man who made modern Britain (2017) pp 371-85. The new Labour government knew the expenses of British involvement across the globe were financially crippling. The postwar military cost £200 million a year, To put 1.3 million men in uniform, combat fleets in the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean as well as a Hong Kong station in China, bases Across the globe, as well as 120 full RAF squadrons.Victor Sebestyen, 1946: The making of the modern world(2014) pp 72-78. Britain now shed traditional overseas military roles as fast as possible.Michael Asteris, \\"British Overseas Military Commitments 1945–47: Making Painful Choices.\\" Contemporary British History 27.3 (2013): 348–371. online American financial aid was available on Washington's terms, as seen in the 1945 loan, the convertibility of sterling crisis of 1947, the devaluation of sterling in 1949, and the rearmament programme in support of the U.S. in the Korean war, 1950–53. On the other hand, he had some success in convincing Washington to take over roles that were too expensive for Britain, including the rebuilding of the European economy, and supporting anti-communist governments in Greece and elsewhere.Martin H. Folly, \\"‘The impression is growing...that the United States is hard when dealing with us’: Ernest Bevin and Anglo-American relations at the dawn of the cold war.\\" Journal of Transatlantic Studies 10.2 (2012): 150–166. online Bevin had the firm support of his party, especially Prime Minister Clement Attlee, despite a left-wing opposition. Top American diplomats such as Dean Acheson trusted Bevin and worked through him. =Cold War= With the election of a Labour government in 1945, union leader Ernest Bevin became foreign secretary despite his lack of foreign policy experience. He is best known for taking a strong anti-Communist position regarding the emerging Cold War, and encouraging the U.S. to take a more active role as budgetary constraints forced Britain to reduce its role in Greece.Alan Bullock, The life and times of Ernest Bevin: vol 3: Foreign Secretary, 1945–1951 (1983) However that was not his original plan. At first he envisioned a European \\"third force\\", led by Britain and France, to mediate between the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. In 1945–46 he hoped that European integration would also allow establish Britain to be free from US economic domination. In January 1946, however, Charles De Gaulle retired and Bevin expected some sort of \\"imminent Sovietization\\" would move France to the left. Furthermore, it became clear that American loans and grants were essential to British solvency. He now decided on a friendly collaboration with the U.S. hoping to guide its role in the Cold War. and strongly encouraged Washington to assume Britain's old role of helping the Greek government suppress a Communist rebellion through the Truman Doctrine.Sean Greenwood, \\"Ernest Bevin, France and 'Western Union': August 1945 – February 1946.\\" European History Quarterly 14.3 (1984): 319–338. Marshall Plan The American Marshall Plan (officially the \\"European Recovery Program\\", ERP) gave $12 billion in financial grants (not loans) to war-torn nations. ERP required the recipients to organize as the \\"Committee on European Economic Co-operation\\". Under Bevin the UK took the lead in coordinating support from the Western European nations that accepted the aid. (Soviet satellites turned the money down.) The British economy has started to recover by 1948—the main goal was not so much rescue or recovery as modernization of the economy. The Marshall Plan wanted to stimulate long-term economic growth. It required the removal all sorts of economic bottlenecks and restrictions, and called for free trade and low tariffs (a long-time American goal). Britain received $3.2 billion; separately Canada gave an unrestricted $1 billion grant. Repayment was not required. The grants were used to purchase oil, wheat, meat and other foods exported from the two donor nations. These products were in turn purchased by British consumers for pounds, and the revenue became matching funds used by UK government to modernize its economy. Britain also received large loans from the U.S. that were repaid over six decades at low interest, used to balance the budget.Rhiannon Vickers and Andrew Gamble, Manipulating Hegemony: State Power, Labour and the Marshall Plan in Britain (2000) pp 43–46. online at Questia =NATO= British diplomacy set the stage for NATO. Britain and France in 1947 signed the Treaty of Dunkirk, a defensive pact. This expanded in 1948 with the Treaty of Brussels to add the three Benelux countries. It committed them to collective defence against any armed attack for fifty years. Bevin worked with Washington to expand the alliance into NATO in 1949, adding the U.S. and Canada as well as Italy, Portugal, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.Cees Wiebes and Bert Zeeman, \\"The Pentagon Negotiations March 1948: The Launching of the North Atlantic Treaty.\\" International Affairs 59.3 (1983): 351–363. West Germany and Spain joined later. Historians give credence to the old wisecrack that the organization's goal was \\"to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down\\". The formation of NATO in 1949 solidified UK-US relations. Britain allowed—indeed encouraged—building American air bases in Britain to threaten the USSR with nuclear attack. Stationing American bombers in Britain gave London a voice in how they could be used and avoided American unilateralism.Jonathan Coleman, \\"The 1950 'Ambassador's agreement' on USAF bases in the UK and British fears of US atomic unilateralism\\" Journal of Strategic Studies (2007) 30#2 pp 285–307. However the U.S. went its own way after 1945 in building nuclear weapons; Britain and later France developed their own.Brian Cathcart, Test of greatness: Britain's struggle for the atom bomb (1994). =Breakup of British Empire= The British built up a very large worldwide British Empire, which peaked in size in 1922. The cumulative costs of fighting two world wars, however, placed a heavy burden upon the UK economy, and after 1945 the British Empire gradually began to disintegrate, with many territories demanding independence. The India region split into India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma. By the late 1950s, almost all the colonies were independent. Most colonial territories joined the Commonwealth of Nations, an organisation of fully independent nations now with equal status to the UK.Lawrence James, The Rise and Fall of the British Empire (2001) Britain reduced its involvements in the Middle East, with the humiliating Suez Crisis of 1956 marking the end of its status as a superpower. However Britain did forge close military ties with the United States, France, and traditional foes such as Germany, in the NATO military alliance. After years of debate (and rebuffs), Britain joined the Common Market in 1973; it is now the European Union.Andrew Marr, A History of Modern Britain (2009) However it did not merge financially, and kept the pound separate from the Euro, which kept it partly isolated from the EU financial crisis of 2011.Stephen Wall, A Stranger in Europe: Britain and the EU from Thatcher to Blair (Oxford University Press, 2008) After years of debate, Britain voted on 23 June 2016 for \\"Brexit\\", to leave the EU.Andrew Gamble, \\"Better Off Out? Britain and Europe.\\" The Political Quarterly (2012) 83#3: 468–477.Nathaniel Copsey and Tim Haughton, \\"Farewell Britannia? 'Issue Capture' and the Politics of David Cameron's 2013 EU Referendum Pledge.\\" JCMS: Journal of Common Market Studies (2014) 52-S1: 74–89. Palestine and Israel The League of Nations assigned Palestine as a mandate to the UK in 1920. The British tried, but failed to stop large- scale Jewish immigration into the mandate. Britain returned it to UN control in 1947 and the UN divided Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. Israel came into existence on May 14, 1948, fought off the Arab neighbors, and became a power in the region.Michael J. Cohen, Britain's Moment in Palestine: Retrospect and Perspectives, 1917–1948 (2014) =Prime Minister Thatcher, 1979–1990= President Reagan and Thatcher at the White House, 16 November 1988 Thatcher appointed Lord Carrington, a former Defence Secretary, as Foreign Secretary, 1979–82.Alan Sked and Chris Cook, Post-War Britain: a political history 1945–1992 (4th ed. 1993) pp 364–422.Peter Byrd, ed., British foreign policy under Thatcher (1988). Although unlike Thatcher he was a centrist Conservative (a \\"wet\\"), he avoided domestic affairs and got along well with the Prime Minister. The first issue was what to do with Rhodesia, where the five percent white population was determined to rule the prosperous largely-black ex-colony in the face of overwhelming international disapproval. After the collapse of the Portuguese empire in Africa in 1975, South Africa – which had been Rhodesia's chief supporter – realized that country was a liability. Black rule was inevitable, and Carrington brokered a peaceful solution at the Lancaster House conference in 1979, attended by Rhodesia's leader Ian Smith, as well as the key black leaders Abel Muzorewa, Robert Mugabe, Joshua Nkomo, and Josiah Tongogara. The conference ended Rhodesia's Bush War. The end result was the new nation of Zimbabwe under black rule in 1980.Roy Lewis, \\"From Zimbabwe‐Rhodesia to Zimbabwe: The Lancaster House conference.\\" The Round Table 70#277 (1980): 6–9.Lord Soames, \\"From Rhodesia to Zimbabwe.\\" International Affairs 56#3 (1980): 405–419. online Thatcher's first foreign policy crisis came with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. She condemned the invasion, said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy, and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics. She gave weak support to US President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions. Britain's economic situation was precarious, and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties.Daniel James Lahey, \\"The Thatcher government's response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 1979–1980,\\" Cold War History (2013) 13#1 pp 21–42. It was reported that her government secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment as early as 1981. Thatcher became closely aligned with the Cold War policies of United States President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism. A more serious disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult with her on the invasion of Grenada.Gary Williams, \\"'A Matter of Regret': Britain, the 1983 Grenada Crisis, and the Special Relationship.\\" Twentieth Century British History 12#2 (2001): 208–230. During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe and permitted the US to station more than 160 cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983. That decision triggered mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £12 billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of January 1986, when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from a consortium which included the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had helped to assemble the consortium, resigned in protest. On 2 April 1982 the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British-controlled Falkland Islands and South Georgia, triggering the Falklands War. The subsequent crisis was \\"a defining moment of her [Thatcher's] premiership\\". At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and Robert Armstrong, she set up and chaired a small War Cabinet (formally called ODSA, Overseas and Defence committee, South Atlantic) to take charge of the conduct of the war, which by 5–6 April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands. Argentina surrendered on 14 June and the operation was hailed a success, notwithstanding the deaths of 255 British servicemen and 3 Falkland Islanders. Argentinian deaths totalled 649, half of them after the nuclear-powered submarine torpedoed and sank the cruiser ARA General Belgrano on 2 May. Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands' defence that led to the war, and especially by Tam Dalyell in parliament for the decision to sink the General Belgrano, but overall she was considered a highly capable and committed war leader. The \\"Falklands factor\\", an economic recovery beginning early in 1982, and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to Thatcher's second election victory in 1983. In September 1982 she visited China to discuss with Deng Xiaoping the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited and she was the first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng stated that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but he was willing to settle the sovereignty issue with Britain through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.Michael B. Yahuda, Hong Kong: China's Challenge (1996). After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997. Although saying that she was in favour of \\"peaceful negotiations\\" to end apartheid,See Hansard HC Debs (25 February 1988) vol 128 col 437 and Written Answers HC Deb (11 July 1988) vol 137 cols 3-4W Thatcher stood against the sanctions imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the EC. She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the government there to abandon apartheid. This included \\"[c]asting herself as President Botha's candid friend\\", and inviting him to visit the UK in June 1984, in spite of the \\"inevitable demonstrations\\" against his government. Thatcher dismissed the African National Congress (ANC) in October 1987 as \\"a typical terrorist organisation\\".See Mr Winnick, Hansard HC Deb (13 November 1987) vol 122 col 701 Thatcher's antipathy towards European integration became more pronounced during her premiership, particularly after her third election victory in 1987. During a 1988 speech in Bruges she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community (EC), forerunner of the European Union, for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making. Thatcher and her party had supported British membership of the EC in the 1975 national referendum, but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition, and feared that the EC's approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation; in 1988, she remarked, \\"We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels\\". Thatcher was firmly opposed to the UK's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a precursor to European monetary union, believing that it would constrain the British economy, despite the urging of her Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990, at what proved to be too high a rate. In April 1986, Thatcher permitted US F-111s to use Royal Air Force bases for the bombing of Libya in retaliation for the Libyan attack on Americans in Berlin, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Thatcher stated: \\"The United States has more than 330,000 members of her forces in Europe to defend our liberty. Because they are here, they are subject to terrorist attack. It is inconceivable that they should be refused the right to use American aircraft and American pilots in the inherent right of self-defence, to defend their own people.\\" Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of Thatcher's decision. She was in the US on a state visit when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded neighbouring Kuwait in August 1990. During her talks with President George H. W. Bush, who had succeeded Reagan in 1989, she recommended intervention, and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. Bush was apprehensive about the plan, prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that \\"This was no time to go wobbly!\\" Thatcher's government provided military forces to the international coalition in the build-up to the Gulf War, but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991. Thatcher was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Following Reagan–Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR, she declared in November 1988 that \\"We're not in a Cold War now\\", but rather in a \\"new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was\\". She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met with Gorbachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Thatcher was initially opposed to German reunification, telling Gorbachev that it \\"would lead to a change to postwar borders, and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security\\". She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO.

It won a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries or Television Film and was nominated for both a British Academy for Film and Television Award (BAFTA) and an Emmy, with Jenny Agutter winning for Best Supporting Actress. The film was shown in the United States on 15 November 1971 as part of the anthology series Hallmark Hall of Fame.  Plot  The film follows the relationship between Fritha (Jenny Agutter), an orphaned young girl, and Philip Rhayader (Richard Harris), a lighthouse keeper in the fishing village Great Marsh in Essex in the United Kingdom. The two meet as Rhayader helps Fritha care for a snow goose she has found, despite his solitary lifestyle. The bird has been injured by hunters shooting at it. Set at the beginning of World War II, the film uses the backdrop of the ongoing political events and battles throughout the narrative. As the goose heals, Fritha and the goose leave Rhayader. Rhayader once again becomes reclusive and confines himself to his lighthouse lodging. As Germany invades Poland and the war begins, Rhayader applies to the Observer Corps, but is denied due to his disabilities. Fritha and the goose eventually return to Rhayader, but Rhayader ventures out to help rescue the British Expeditionary Force, trapped on the beaches of Dunkirk. He is killed during the Dunkirk evacuation, and the goose returns to Fritha, who is now a grownup. She realises she had come to love Rhayader, and is able to save one of the paintings he had made of her, as a child with the wounded goose, before the lighthouse and all other artwork is obliterated by a German pilot.

It is named after its primary function of enshrining the bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha. Origin As his name occurs in Chinese texts such as the Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra (), the Chinese name of Kṣitigarbha is \\"Dìzàng\\" (地藏; lit. \\"earth storehouse\\"). The Daśacakra Kṣitigarbha Sūtra () elaborates: ::\\"Kṣitigarbha is patient and immovable like the great earth; his meditation is deep and profound like a secret storehouse.\\" ::() Due to Shakyamuni Buddha's exhortations, Kṣitigarbha has to cultivate all the living creatures in adherence to the Dharma and eliminate all suffering in the period spanning from Shakyamuni's Parinirvana to Maitreya's final birth. Kṣitigarbha has made the vow: ::\\"Until the hells are empty (of suffering beings), I will not become a Buddha.\\" ::() ::\\"Once all sentient beings are saved, I will attain Buddhahood.\\" ::() ::\\"If I do not descend into hell, who will?\\" ::() It is through this gesture of selflessness that he became recognized as \\"foremost in compassion and vows\\" and has been worshiped by people since ancient times. Enshrined image In Chinese Buddhism, Kṣitigarbha's image is usually in the form of a Buddhist monk; complete with a robe, shaved head or in a vishnu lou cap. He sits in the lotus posture and wields a khakkhara in his left hand, symbolizing the unification of compassion for all living creations whilst holding strictly to the moral precepts. In his right hand is a ruyi, signifying the fulfillment of the wishes of all living creatures. Some images depict him standing in a triad that includes a father-son duo: Daoming (), a bhikshu who stands to his left, and Mingong (), a wealthy elderly man on his right.

It debuted October 16, 2015 at the Buffalo International Film Festival.  Synopsis  The film documents the struggle of six contemporary poets who have faced the duress of war, exile, and human rights violations to give voice to their experiences while wrestling with the complex moral quandaries of artistic production, memory, and trauma. The poets: Carolyn Forché (Salvadoran Civil War), Saghi Ghahraman (Iranian Revolution), Fady Joudah (Doctors Without Borders), Claudia Serea (Socialist Republic of Romania), Mario Susko (Bosnian War), and Bruce Weigl (Vietnam War) offer first-person accounts of how their experiences as soldier, activist, doctor, and survivor imprint their poetry as evidence of those conflicts, rather than as representations of them. Along the way, the poets read from their work and all poems are accompanied by original artwork by Jimmy Buitrago, as well as a musical score by Will Lewis. Duncan Wu (Georgetown University) and Neil J. Kressel (William Paterson University) help to contextualize these discussions throughout with historical and psychoanalytic perspectives. The film can be seen as an extension of the decades-long work Forché has conducted in the subject, beginning with her anthology Against Forgetting: Twentieth Century Poetry of Witness (1993). Coinciding with the publication of a new anthology (co-edited by Forché and Wu), Poetry of Witness: The Tradition in English, 1500–2001 (2014), this documentary aims to bring this work to a wider audience.

Sihvonen's style was greatly influenced by Josef Albers who taught him color theory and Bauhaus aesthetics at Black Mountain College in the 1940s. Sihvonen was also influenced by Russian Constructivism, Piet Mondrian, and Pierre Matisse. His work has been linked to Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Hard-Edge and Op-Art.  Biography  Oli Sihvonen was a Finnish-American born in Brooklyn, New York in 1921. He began his art career by attending the Norwich Art School, now known as Norwich University College of the Arts, in Connecticut from 1933 to 1938. He then studied at the Art Students League of New York from 1938 to 1941. He served in the U. S. Army during World War II. After which he studied art from his mentor Josef Albers at Black Mountain College in North Carolina from 1946 to 1948, where he met and befriended many people including Buckminster Fuller, Merce Cunningham, Robert Creeley, John Cage. Tapestry weaver Joan Potter Loveless also attended Black Mountain and the couple married in 1947. Throughout his career Sihvonen was noted for his dedication to painting that began at Black Mountain College and carried through to his time in Taos, Mexico where he started to be recognized for his ellipse paintings, and then also in New York where he received much critical, if not financial, success. \\"His entire body of work remained clean, objective and flat, with no gestural or emotional contrivances.\\" After graduating from Black Mountain, Sihvonen lived and studied in New Mexico under the G.I. Bill at Louis Ribak’s Taos Valley Art School from 1949 to 1950. He then went to Mexico where he painted murals. He then moved to Washington D.C. and later New York where he taught at Hunter College and Cooper Union. In the 1950s Sihvonen moved to Taos, New Mexico where he stayed until the 1960s. During this time he painted large canvases and diptychs. While in Taos he was considered a part of a group of modern artists known as the Taos Moderns. Because of the scale and subject matter of his paintings there wasn't a strong market for them in New Mexico in the 1950s and 1960s, but he was gaining attention in New York. In 1965 The Museum of Modern Art acquired one of his Ellipse paintings for the exhibition \\"The Responsive Eye.\\" He moved to back to New York in 1967. Through the 1970s and 1980s Sihvonen continued to paint and exhibit regularly. He spent time with Allan Graham in New York - in the mid to late 1980s Sihvonen gave Graham a roll of echocardiograms of his heart and suggested he make something out of them.

In this position he almost always employed Cornishmen as his assistants, and most of the miners were also immigrants from Cornwall. Early years Henry Roach was born in 1808 in Redruth, Cornwall. Roach worked at the Tresavean mine at Lanner, Cornwall. He also worked in Colombia. He reached South Australia in 1846. Burra mine A shepherd had come across copper ore near Burra Creek in 1845, and another shepherd found copper ore to the north soon after. This triggered a scramble by miners from Adelaide to get control of the land. The northern half became the Burra Mine, one of the world's largest copper mines. Most of the miners and specialists at the Burra mine were from Cornwall, with 1,000 workers at one point. Roach was soon made captain at the Burra mine in charge of the underground workings, and then made chief captain of all mine operations. He was superintendent from 1847. He continued as captain, with a salary of £300. For most of the mine's period of operation Henry Ayers was the company's chief secretary, working in Adelaide. The first of several beam engines from Cornwall was ordered by Ayers in August 1847. Roach oversaw the erection of all the Cornish engines. Roach's engine house was completed in 1849 and pumping began in October 1849. Roach always recommended Cornishmen for his assistants. Matthew Bryant was hired as second captain in June 1847. The \\"grass captain\\", Samuel Penglaze, was appointed in 1848. Roach employed Cornishmen such as Richard Goldsworthy of Bodmin, third captain, John Congdon from the Caradon mines, chief engineer, and Philip Santo of Saltash, clerk of works. The Cornwall and Devon Society was founded in South Australia in December 1850 with John Bentham Neales of Plymouth, an investor in the Burra mine, as secretary. The aim was to encourage immigration from the English counties of Cornwall and Devon, and to look after the interests of colonists from those counties. Henry Roach was a member of the committee. Roach named the township of Redruth at Burra after his home town in Cornwall. A number of miners made homes in caves in the bank of Burra creek rather than pay rent to the company. In the autumn of 1851 there were a series of floods that drove them out. Ayers was sympathetic at first, but soon posted a notice saying that any miner who chose to remain in the caves would be considered a trespasser. Knowing that Roach was likely to be soft on the men, Ayers gave Roach firm instructions not to help the washed-out families. He did allow Roach to help rebuild the bridge across the creek, but only if doing so did not delay completion of the new engine house. In 1852 gold was discovered in Victoria, and many of the miners left Burra. The number of employees declined to 100 from an earlier peak of 1,000. Pumping was suspended in October 1852 and the mine was flooded. In 1853 mining had almost ceased, and Roach's engine house was dismantled. Men gradually returned in 1854, and in 1855 pumping resumed. By 1861 there were six engines in operation to drain the mines, and three smaller engines to raise and crush the copper ore. With a slump in the price of copper, Ayers told Roach on 19 February 1866 that all operations would be suspended and all officers were dismissed as of the end of March. Some work continued dressing existing low-grade ore. Roach was given one month's notice in 1867. Roach retired in 1868. In 1874 Roach put up a flour mill in Graham, which stood until 1941. Captain Henry Roach died on 6 October 1889. He was aged 80.

Foundation  On June 14, 1985, the bishop of the diocese of Trapani, Mons. Emanuele Romano, established a new Parish dedicated to Gesù Cristo Redentore; it was entrusted to Don Benedetto Cottone (the parson of this Church for 23 consecutive years) starting his experience in small premises located in Via Kennedy, which remained the place of communion for 19 years. After two years in another place located in Via Tre Santi, they succeeded in completing a hospitable, large and beautiful church. It has been the centre of the parish life of Sant’Anna district, for 10 years up to now and on April 4, 2015, on the 30th anniversary of the foundation, they have organized a very great feast with sport, cultural and religious events, including the procession which was authorized by the Bishop of Trapani Mons. Pietro Maria Fragnelli. In 2016 they wanted to repeat this experience, thanks to the parishioners who collaborated with the present parson, Don Franco Finazzo, for the success of the different events.  Description  The interior of the church In the planning of the overall parish “Gesù Cristo Redentore”, they have followed the guidelines recommended by the Conferenza Episcopale Italiana (Italian Episcopal Conference) in 1993.divisare.com, http://divisare.com/projects/15141-vincenzo-calvaruso-progetto-chiesa-gesu- cristo-redentore-di-alcamo . The church, in a central position in the district of “Sant’Anna” (in the area of Via Kennedy) is an example of how the use of glued laminated timber allows to link functionality and beauty; it is larger than 600 square metres and, in accordance with the regulations on the removing of architectural barriers, it has a sloping floor towards the Presbytery (architecture), with a declivity which allows an optimal participation to the believers during the liturgical functions.http://www.archilovers.com/projects/95719/chiesa-parrocchiale-gesu- cristo-redentore.html It is made up of the Presbytery, located in the apse, with a step higher than the hall, the Ambon and the sacramental area, with a wooden dome (in glued laminated timber) above it; the floor here is realized with polychrome marbles and so believers can differentiate the meaning of the different liturgical functions; a central nave, corresponding with the hall, and with about 600 seats, and two aisles for the coming in and out of people, and for the processional route during the functions; the parvis which permits the outdoor celebrations with a great participation of believers, thanks to its position on the top of the staircases. Initially the plan also included the building of the bell tower, with a small dome surmounted by a cross, with seven bronze bells. The premises for the parish activities include a large hall, in accordance with the regulations on the removing of architectural barriers, which is a little sloping, letting people have a better visual participation, and nine rooms for the catechism lessons. The arcade (architecture), three metres large and around the main structure, is like a covered walkway for people coming out of the hall and the other rooms on the ground floor, from the parvis towards the rectory and the sacristy on the eastern side, and towards the public car-park on the western side. Finally the open spaces include a car-park, on the south-west side with the access from via Kennedy, a basketball field, and some arranged green areas, where there are plants characteristic of the Mediterranean flora.  Works  There are three very beautiful sculptures made by Massimiliano Apicella from Turin: * Gesù Cristo Redentore, in Carrara white marble (2006) * The Lord’s table (altar), represented by two hands while breaking bread (2006, in Carrara white marble too) * The Ambon (2009, in red marble) with the symbols of Alpha and Omega Inside the Church there are also these works: * the Crucifixion, an icon * The Pentecost , a painting by Stefano Papa * Our Lady with the Infant Jesus, a painting by Valentina Cavarretta * The Divine Mercy, a painting by Enza Ferrera (2006) * Gesù Cristo Redentore (Jesus Christ the Redeemer), a plaster statue, used during the procession.

The photograph's background shows a reduced contrast to place more emphasis on the locomotive. A builder's photo, also called an official photo, is a specific type of photograph that is typically made by rail transport rolling stock manufacturers to show a vehicle that has been newly built or rebuilt. The builder's photo is meant to show an overview of the basic exterior form of a unit of rolling stock. Photographs made by railfans that show similar features to builder's photos are sometimes informally referred to as roster shots. Builder's photos were also made by some automobile manufacturers to show a representative sample of new models they produced. Prints of builder's photos were also often made for executives of the manufacturers and railroad companies to hang in their offices. Builder's photos were also reproduced as post cards as well as reprinted in advertisements to promote the railroad companies or manufacturers depicted therein. In the United Kingdom, steam locomotives were often temporarily painted in photographic grey color schemes so they would photograph well in black and white images. Some details in darker-colored areas of the subject were also sometimes painted in a high- contrast bright color to ensure that they would be visible in the photograph. Historians and preservationists use builder's photos as official references to show the equipment as-built. Builder's photos are commonly shot from an angle that shows one end, often the designated front end, and a full side of the car or locomotive. The rolling stock is normally positioned on a section of track with no other rolling stock coupled to it for the photograph. Sometimes the photograph was further processed to reduce the contrast of or even entirely remove the background to further highlight the rolling stock that was photographed.

Built in 1900 by the Boston and Maine Railroad, it is a well-preserved rural station, designed to house the stationmaster as well as providing station facilities. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The former Ely Depot stands in a rural area of southern Fairlee, on a triangular strip of land bordered on the west by the former railroad tracks of the Boston and Maine Railroad, and on the east by an old alignment of United States Route 5, which now roughly parallels the tracks just to their west. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. On the track-facing side, a full-height section projects to a cross gable, which originally housed the telegrapher's booth. The east-facing facade has some brackets, evidence of a cantilevered porch that once projected from its second floor. An original semaphore mast stands near the building's northwest corner. The interior retains most of its original layout, which included a lobby, station office, and freight storage area, with a residential space on the second floor. with The railroad line passing through southern Fairlee was opened in 1848 by the Connecticut and Passumpsic River Railroad (C&PRR;), and the station located here was originally known as Wares Crossing, after a local landowner. In 1865, Smith Ely, the owner of a mining operation in Vershire, purchased land for a freight forwarding and storage facility, since it was uneconomical to run a rail line toward his mines. The present building was constructed about 1900 by the Boston & Maine, the successor to the C&PRR;, after the previous station was destroyed by fire. In the early decades of the 20th century, the station became a popular stop for vacationers en route to the growing summer camps of Lake Fairlee. The station was closed in the 1960s. In the 1970s the lobby and agent's office were used as a local post office.

A graduate of Alfred University's School of Ceramics, Anderson was a leading glass designer for the Blenko Glass Company of West Virginia (1946-1953) and Design Director for Lenox China and Crystal, located in Trenton, New Jersey (1953-1979). He was the recipient of numerous accolades during his lifetime, including Museum of Modern Art Good Design Awards. His works have been exhibited and collected by museums across the United States, including the Baltimore Museum of Art, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Early years Anderson was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, the son of Marguerite Paula Rogers (1893 - 1972) and George J. Anderson, who divorced sometime during the 1930s with Anderson remaining with his mother.United States Census, 1920, 1930, 1940 He grew up sailing the waters near Plymouth and on Long Island Sound, and his love of boats and sailing were an important early influence on his design aesthetic. He stated that as a teenager he would spend hours drawing boats and building models and that he was fascinated by the rhythmic qualities of their soft, curved lines. Anderson was also particularly fascinated by antiques displayed during his youth in the shops of his hometown, where he noticed the, > Hand-dipped candles, hand-loomed woven items, pewter, pottery, hand-crafted > furniture, and many other crafted products [that] all influenced my sense of > form... The products all reflected a proper use of the materials from which > they were made. I was never taught the 'rightness' of the proper use of > these materials - I simply 'absorbed it.'Rick Wilson, Winslow Anderson: A > Life in Glass, Glass Collector's Digest, June/July 1988 Education As a young man, he began his studies at the nearby Plymouth Pottery (where he worked c. 1937-40) after years of odd jobs, where it quickly became clear to his employers that he had a talent for hand craftsmanship. A group of alumni from Alfred University who saw his pottery on a visit to Plymouth strongly encouraged him to apply to the University's School of Ceramics.Blenko Oral History Interviews, Tape #218834, transcript copy held by the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV The original intention of the school was to create industrial designers for America, and particularly for New York State. At Alfred University Anderson thrived in the atmosphere created by the faculty. In February 1941 he joined his professor, Charles Harder (1899 - 1959), and a select group of other students on a trip to visit (and learn from) southern potteries located in Erwin, Tennessee.The Alfred Sun, February 6, 1941 While at Alfred he also studied with the respected Japanese potter, Shōji Hamada (1894 – 1978), who was known for sourcing all of his materials locally. Only a short time into his studies, World War II broke out, and Anderson found himself in the Army. During his four-year service in the United States military he served as a topographical draftsman and lived in Manhattan and on Long Island. It was during this period that he designed and built an African style mask composed entirely of scrap parts, including hooks, springs and pieces of brass. The mask was entered into the Metropolitan Museum of Art's 1945/46 exhibition and design competition for Army personnel in the \\"Inventive Use of Improvised Materials\\" section, where it was awarded 2nd prize.The Daily Times News, Burlington, NC, December 24, 1945 Upon his return to Alfred University after the conclusion of the war in 1946 a school-wide competition was held inviting students to design a goblet. The winner of the competition would have their drawing crafted into an actual goblet by the glassblowers of the famous Steuben Glass Works. Anderson's creation was selected as the winning design, and the actual glass goblet created by Steuben is today housed in the collection of the Huntington Museum of Art, located in Huntington, West Virginia.Winslow Anderson: Artist and Designer, Huntington Museum of Art, pamphlet, 1999 He went on to graduate from Alfred University with departmental honors (magna cum laude) in Industrial Ceramic Design in June 1947. =Other studies= During two summers (c. 1945-46) spent in Provincetown, Massachusetts Anderson studied with the noted modernist painter, Hans Hofmann (1880 - 1966). In addition, during his residency in New Jersey Anderson took evening classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, studying with the painters Morris Blackburn (1902 - 1979) and Oliver Grimley (b. 1920).Winslow Anderson Collection of Haitian Art, Huntington Museum of Art, catalog, 2004 Blenko Glass Anderson's work at Blenko Glass, located in Milton, West Virginia, began as jobs do - with a search for the right candidate, > In 1946 William Blenko, Sr. decided it was time to hire a resident designer. > He contacted Alfred University's College of Ceramics in Alfred, NY to see if > they had any promising prospects. The school recommended Winslow Anderson. Shortly after his graduation Anderson began his position at Blenko Glass where he was quickly appointed as their first full-time in house designer, a position he occupied from 1947 - 1953. While at Blenko he introduced over 160 new and different designs, entirely reshaping the company's product line and its future production focus. The majority of his designs were influenced by smooth, simplified and streamlined shapes and forms that were influenced by modern, Swedish design aesthetics and by his growing interest in the chemistry and nature of glass. Anderson himself credited his success with glass to his training in pottery, > There is a very great similarity in handling clay and glass. There is a > sharp cutoff in the idea that in glass you are working with a hot molten > material and in clay you are working with a cold piece of clay. But the > manipulation of a hand-thrown pot can be compared to blowing a mouth-shaped > piece of glass. The opening of the glass is identical to the way clay > handles. I only had to watch them make glass for a day or two. It came very > naturally.Winslow Anderson: Artist and Designer Developing new designs at Blenko during Anderson's tenure was a multi-step process, which begin first with a cross section drawing or the creation of a pottery form. Following this, a wooden form would be made and Anderson would work closely with glass blowers and finishers deciding if the shape and size were correct, or if they needed improvement. Then another drawing was made that reflected any changes that were made, followed by the creation of a new mold. This process would be repeated until the shape and texture achieved a level of acceptable refinement. His success at Blenko led to an invitation in 1948 to speak at the National Ceramic Convention.Huntington Galleries, New American Glass: Focus West Virginia, catalog, 1976 While at Blenko, Anderson also oversaw promotional activities that would coincide with his new line. This included the design in 1949 of a new, brightly colored and modern looking billboard that featured his new glass forms and shapes and which invited viewers to come to see them in person at Blenko's showroom. Later that year he traveled back to Alfred for the annual Arts Festival.The Alfred Sun, June 2, 1949 In 1950 Anderson returned again to Alfred University to study with the noted British Potter, Bernard Leach (1887 - 1979), whose simple and utilitarian style greatly influenced modern design in North America during the 1950s and 1960s.The Alfred Sun, March 30, 1950 The three-week, in-depth course almost certainly had a profound effect on the work being carried out by Anderson at Blenko. Lenox China and Crystal After seven years at Blenko, Anderson decided to make a move to a more prestigious position at Lenox China and Crystal, located in Trenton, New Jersey, where he became Design Director of the firm in 1953. That July John Tassie of Lenox hired Anderson to succeed Frank Graham Holmes, who had served as chief designer since 1905. One of his first tasks was to create a modern line of glass (Lenox had acquired the Bryce Glassware Company of Mt. Pleasant, PA soon after his arrival) as well as develop new product lines for the china division of the company. In order to determine what Lenox's clientele was looking for he spent time in department stores observing shoppers. He quickly determined that most were looking for designs that reflected a more conservative, classical style, which led him to introduce china with elements that related to the natural world, incorporating aspects of different varieties of flowers and vegetables, including cabbage and ginkgo leaves, as well as wares decorated with more subtle decorations and gilt finishes. During his quarter century in New Jersey Anderson found time to share his talents with others, including teaching ceramics in the early 1950s at the short lived, Princeton Group Arts.Town Topics, Princeton, NJ, September - October 1953 Founded in 1946, Princeton Group Arts was originally organized by Princeton University professors and members of nearby Jewish and Quaker communities to form a cultural organization that was integrated both on a racial and religious level, something that was novel in the region during the period. Personal life \\"The Gay Tray,\\" 1970, Private Collection, Huntington WV.As a gay man, Anderson had an interest in the changing nature of American civil rights during his career. Ever aware of the persecution individuals like himself could suffer, he carefully planned excursions and vacations to places that would be welcoming to those of his persuasion. He researched travel locations extensively, particularly in Europe and the Caribbean, noting whether they had \\"gay friendly\\" bars, clubs, or beaches located nearby.Winslow Anderson papers, collection of the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV During the late 1960s/early 1970s when civil rights ordinances were under threat across the United States, Anderson became particularly annoyed by the actions of the conservative activist, Anita Bryant. As an artistic statement done partially in response to Bryant's anti-gay efforts, he created a sculptural protest piece entitled \\"The Gay Tray\\" (1970). Designed after an anti-gay quote he saw in a men's toilet which read \\"Cock Suckers Eat Babies,\\" the work features a tray of babies served up as hors d'oeuvres on lacquered Ritz crackers.Private Collection, Huntington, WV In 1979 Anderson retired from Lenox and moved back to West Virginia where he settled in a small cottage in Milton not far from the Blenko factory. In retirement he indulged his passion for collecting, filling his small home with anything and everything that fascinated him, from pottery and glass, to paintings and souvenirs from his travels. Winslow Anderson died at the age of ninety on December 10, 2007 and was buried in the Milton Cemetery near his mother. Much of his collection and estate was willed to the Huntington Museum of Art, where an endowment was established in his name which helps to fund the conservation and acquisition of artwork for the museum's permanent collection. Exhibitions Winslow Anderson participated in numerous exhibitions during his long career. While at Alfred University he participated in student exhibitions and competitions. His works were included in exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as early as 1945. In 1946 and 1947 his ceramic pieces were included in the Eleventh and Twelfth Annual National Ceramics Exhibitions held at the Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts (Everson Museum of Art).Syracuse Museum of Fine Arts, Catalogs, 1946 and 1947, collection of the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV In 1949 Anderson, along with other colleagues who had studied at Alfred University, were included in the major 'For Modern Living' exhibition which was held at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The exhibition included more than 2,000 designs for home furnishings from modern designers from throughout the world, five of which were either graduates of or instructors at Alfred University.\\"Exhibits at Detroit Museum of Arts,\\" The Alfred Sun, September 29, 1949 During the 1940s his paintings were included in exhibitions at New York's Museum of Non-Objective Painting, which later became the Solomon R.

Other exhibitions in which he participated during this period include the \\"Living Up-To-Date\\" exhibition held at the Baltimore Museum of Art and the \\"For Your Home\\" exhibition held at the University of Illinois at Urbana, both held in 1951, and at the Fourth Annual International Exhibition of Ceramic Arts, held in Washington, D.C. in 1953, where Anderson received the \\"Leo Popper and Sons Award.\\"Living Up-To-Date, catalog, 1951, For Your Home, catalog, 1951, Fourth Annual international Ceramics Exhibition, catalog, 1953, all held in the collection of the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV He was featured on American television as early as 1959 and his works were discussed and/or illustrated in national magazines, including House & Garden and House Beautiful.WCAU-TV Letter, 1959, and copies of these magazines are held in the collection of Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV His glass designs continue to be extremely popular due to the massive interest in modern design and are exhibited regularly across the country, including at the 2007 exhibition \\"Blenko: West Virginia's Gift to the World,\\" held at the West Virginia State Museum in 2007. One of the most recent exhibitions in which his glass creations were shown was the 2012 exhibition \\"20th Century American Art Glass, Blenko: The First Four Designers, 1947-74,\\" held at Culture • Object at the Cassina SoHo Showroom, located in New York City. Early keyboard instruments Anderson had a strong interest in early keyboard instruments, including the organ and the predecessors to the modern piano. He spoke at AGO (American Guild of Organists) meetings and was the proud owner of a virginal designed and built by Arnold Dolmetsch (1858-1940), one of the leading figures in the revival of early music during the 20th century. Anderson's virginal was built at the Chickering factory in 1906 (serial number 13) and was based on a circa 1612 instrument by the Ruckers Family of Antwerp. It was played by a number of individuals during his ownership, including the noted New York based organist and harpsichordist, Harold Chaney (1930-2014). Anderson owned this instrument until 1981, when he sold it to Siri von Reis Gaull of Fifth Avenue, New York City, wife of the noted scientist and educator, Gerald E. Gaull (1931-1997).Winslow Anderson papers and correspondence with Siri Gaull, 1981, collection of the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV Collection of Haitian art One of the Anderson's lasting contributions to our shared cultural heritage is the extensive collection of Haitian paintings and sculptures he assembled over a forty-year period. He was first introduced to the work of Haitian artist while visiting a friend who had a coffee table book on the subject written by the author, Selden Rodman. Anderson stated that upon seeing the book he was \\"electrified by the illustrations\\" and his friend, who worked in the Bureau of Cultural Relations for the Caribbean and South America, wrote a letter of introduction for him to DeWitt Peters, the founder of Le Centre d'Art in Port-au-Prince. Peters and Anderson became quick friends, and he advised Anderson on his purchases until his death in 1966.A Personal View - Winslow Anderson, personal reminiscence, copy held by the Huntington Museum of Art, Huntington, WV Beginning in 1948 and continuing through 1989, Anderson traveled regularly to the Republic of Haiti, where he sought out the work of local painters who had only begun to be recognized for their work. Over the next five decades he purchased nearly 160 artworks, including paintings, metal cut-outs, and wooden sculptures by artists working in Haiti he could afford, including Gabriel Alix, Montas Antoine, Rigaud Benoit, Préfète Duffaut, Hector Hyppolite, Jasmin Joseph, Stephane Magloire, Sénèque Obin, and Salnave Philippe-Auguste.Winslow Anderson Collection of Haitian Art According to Jenine Culligan, former Senior Curator at the Huntington Museum of Art, Anderson > made annual trips to Haiti – often visiting every six months. Each day he > spent in Port-au-Prince, he visited Le Centre d'Art, and with the eye of a > trained artist/designer, he carefully perused the stacks of paintings > available for purchase, pulled his favorites, and in a separate room, began > his own stack of works he wished to acquire. DeWitt Peters determined the > price of each painting the day before Anderson departed Haiti. The two would > meet, go through Anderson's “stack,” and figure prices. Anderson would > reluctantly pare his selection down to those he could afford – and one can > imagine the friendly dickering that must have occurred. In his forty years > of visiting Haiti, Anderson met many of the pioneers of Haitian painting, > and purchased representations of their early styles. A number of works > [were] gifts from artists to Mr. Anderson, including a copper cut-out > sculpture by Georges Liautaud, an artist whose work Anderson could never > afford to purchase. Parts of this important collection have been included in major museum exhibitions, including four paintings by Rigaud Benoit, and one by Salnave Philippe-August that were part of one of the first major exhibitions titled 'Haitian Art,' organized by The Brooklyn Museum in 1978, which traveled to the Milwaukee Art Center, and the New Orleans Museum of Art. Selections from the collection have been displayed at The Regional Arts Center, Centre College, Danville, Kentucky (April 5 - May 3, 1981); Southern Ohio Museum and Cultural Center, Portsmouth, Ohio (May 24 - August 1, 1981); and The Headley-Whitney Museum, Lexington, Kentucky (April 4 - June 10, 1982).

The project, led by the OECD's Committee on Fiscal Affairs, began in 2013 with OECD and G20 countries, in a context of financial crisis and tax affairs (e.g. Offshore Leaks). Currently, after the BEPS report has been delivered in 2015, the project is now in its implementation phase, 116 countries are involved, including a majority of developing countries. During two years, the package was developed by participating members on an equal footing, as well as widespread consultations with jurisdictions and stakeholders, including business, academics and civil society. And since 2016, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS provides for its 116 members a platform to work on an equal footing to tackle BEPS, including through peer review of the BEPS minimum standards, and monitoring of implementation of the BEPS package as a whole. The BEPS project looks to develop multilateral dialogue and could be achieved thanks to a successful international cooperation, unavoidable when it comes to such a domestic and sovereign topic. It is one of the instances of the OECD that involves developing countries in its process. The European Commission and the US have unilaterally taken actions in 2017-2018 that implement several key measures of the BEPS project, even going beyond in some cases. Content =Project Aim= The aim of the project is to mitigate tax code loopholes and country-to-country inconsistencies so that corporations cannot shift profits from a country with a high corporate tax rate to countries with a low tax rate. The practice - in particular double non-taxation - is usually legal but often involves complex maneuvers within tax law. BEPS is costly for all parties involved, save the firm. The citizens’ trust in tax systems can be harmed by widespread tax avoidance practices, which puts at stake fiscal consent a concept at the core of modern democracies ; it is also a loss of revenues for the State. A conservative estimate has annual tax revenue losses between 100 and US$240 billion (i.e. 4-10% of global revenues from corporate income tax) due to profit shifting around the globe. A study by the Tax Justice Network estimated that around US$660 billion of corporate profits were shifted in 2012. In developed countries like those comprising the OECD, BEPS undermines the integrity of tax systems. In developing countries, where there is heavy reliance on corporate taxes, revenues are trimmed, leaving states underfunded and underinvested. Furthermore, the project serves as an alternative to the deterioration of international tax norms. The project's Action Plan states that a failure to address BEPS would spawn “the emergence of competing sets of international standards, and the replacement of the current consensus-based framework by unilateral measures, which could lead to global tax chaos marked by the massive re-emergence of double taxation. In this respect, the BEPS project serves as an example of cooperation in game theory. The project prevents both double taxation and double non-taxation, as well as countries undercutting others by lowering tax rates to attract business. Countries cooperating yields a better outcome than non-cooperation. =Inclusive Framework= In October 2015, after two years of negotiations and development, a 15-point Action Plan was announced by the OECD and G20 to address BEPS. The Inclusive Framework was established in 2016, it was deemed necessary that for an effective international tax framework, developing countries must be involved. To gain membership, non-OECD/G20 countries must commit to the BEPS package, a plan to “equip government with domestic and international instruments to address tax avoidance, ensuring that profits are taxed where economic activities generating the profits are performed and where value is created.” All countries in the framework work on equal footing to implement the BEPS package. The package consists of 15 action plans that provide tax standards in exchange for a membership fee (discounted for developing countries). As of May 2018, 116 countries had signed on to the project. =BEPS Achievements= During its ongoing implementation and as of July 2018, the BEPS project of the OECD allowed to achieve the following realisations : * The Inclusive Framework on BEPS brings 116 countries and jurisdictions participating on an equal footing in the Project, representing over 95% of the global GDP (inc. some well-known financial centers). * 175 regimes have been reviewed and more than 130 regimes have already been amended or abolished or are in the process of being amended or abolished, moreover information on 17 000 tax rulings have already been identified and exchanged. * Measures to fight BEPS were included in 1,400 treaties, through the MLI. * Almost 50 jurisdictions started to automatically exchange financial account information in September 2017 and more than 50 will begin in September 2018. The first annual peer review report of Action 13 (Country-by-Country reporting), contains a comprehensive examination of 95 jurisdictions. * By July 2018, US$414 million of additional revenues have been raised with costs of less than US$4 million through the Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB) initiative. Since 2012, TIWB completed 7 projects, 31 are currently operational, and there are 23 in the pipeline in Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, and Eastern Europe. =BEPS Examples= A spate of BEPS scandals in the past decade has served as an impetus for the OECD's action. The largest firms are often U.S. multinationals avoiding the high (35%) worldwide corporate tax rate in the United States. However BEPS tools (and structuring) are also increasingly used in money laundering/regulatory avoidance. The following are prominent examples of the leading BEPS tools in operation today: Structure The BEPS project consists of 15 action plans with 4 minimum standards, agreed to by all participating countries who have committed to consistent implementation. Some measures can be used immediately, others require renegotiating bilateral tax treaties. Action 1: Address the Digital Economy * The BEPS project recommends avoiding new direct taxes on digital activity, and expects other Actions to be generalized to tackle the digital economy as well. * For indirect taxes, a shift to tax collection in the jurisdiction of consumption is recommended. *This Action also paves the way for more taxes to be collected on low-value e-commerce transactions by shifting value added tax obligations to the vendor. Action 2: Hybrids * Advises the creation of domestic mismatching rules, which addresses the different treatment of corporate taxable activity by nations. *Recommends tax treaty provisions that eliminate issues like double nontaxation or double deduction. Action 3: Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) Rules * Seeks to establish a standard definition of a CFC and its income, and proposes rules that eliminate mismatches or holes that allow CFCs to shift income elsewhere. Action 4: Interest Deductions * Outlines a common approach to end base erosion by interest deduction rules for eligible MNEs. *Suggests rules that account for a firm's debt level and interest deductions, creating a ratio standard that prevents MNE from favorable tax deductions. Action 5: Harmful Tax Practices (minimum standard) * Allows for a methodology that assesses harmful tax practices, like preferential regimes. * Creates a framework for compulsory spontaneous exchange of information regarding tax rulings and practices. Action 6: Treaty Abuse (minimum standard) * Creates several provisions for a minimum standard to combat treaty shopping that all participating countries have agreed to implement. *Suggests specific anti-abuse rules be included in domestic legislation. Action 7: Permanent Establishment Status *Greatly expands the definition of a permanent establishment to counter MNE tactics used to avoid having a taxable presence in a country. Actions 8-10: Transfer Pricing *Moves to align transfer pricing outcomes with value creation. *Creates stronger guidelines to transactions involving the transfer pricing of intangibles and contractual arrangements. Action 11: BEPS Data Analysis *Establishes the synchronization of data collection, which indicators to look to, and methodologies to analyze data. Action 12: Disclosure of Aggressive Tax Planning * Recommends mandatory disclosure of aggressive tax planning to increase transparency. Action 13: Transfer Pricing Documentation (minimum standard) *Guidelines for documentation of transfer pricing, including country-to-country disclosure. Action 14: Dispute Resolution(minimum standard) *Stipulates minimum standards for treaty disputes and arbitration. Action 15: Multilateral Instrument *Lays out the legal and technical difficulties the BEPS project faces in its mission to create a multilateral tax framework. The Instrument is called Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and entered into force on 1 July 2018. Other initiatives In 2017–2018, both the U.S. and the European Commission decided to depart from the OECD BEPS process and timetable, and launch their own anti-BEPS tax regimes: * U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which has several anti-BEPS regimes, including GILTI tax and interest deductibility limits. * EU Commission 2018 Digital Services Tax, which is less advanced than the U.S. TCJA, but does seek to impose a minimum tax rate via a quasi-VAT. The departure of the U.S. and EU Commission from the OECD BEPS project is attributed to frustrations with the rise in intellectual property (or IP), as a key BEPS tool to create intangible assets, which are then turned into royalty payment BEPS schemes (double Irish), and/or capital allowance BEPS schemes (capital allowances for intangibles). In contrast, the OECD has spent decades developing intellectual property as a legal and a GAAP accounting concept. Ireland, who has some of the most advanced IP-based BEPS tools in the world, and have the first OECD-approved IP-box, has been a supporter of the OECD BEPS project (see Feargal O'Rourke quote). Ireland's capital allowances for intangibles scheme was the BEPS structure to secure it as an ultra-low tax (i.e. 0-3% in perpuity) location for U.S. multinationals, that is in full compliance with all OECD guidelines, and the OECD BEPS project. However, the U.S. and EU's new tax regimes deliberately \\"override\\" these IP-based BEPS tools. Ireland has opened a new line of Debt-based BEPS tools which use securitization vehicles to create advanced artificial loan structures that are hard to understand and track in the $10 trillion global securitisation sector (the securitization orphan structure approach also hides their ownership). Main tool is the Section 110 SPV.

It was shown on 31 October 1974 on BBC 1 as the first episode of the fifth Play for Today series. Background The film is based on an unofficial strike amongst female textile workers in Leeds in February 1970, demanding equal pay with male workers. Dramatist Colin Welland's mother-in-law was involved in the strike, and Welland interviewed many of those involved while preparing his script. BFI Screenonline, Leeds - United! (1974), by Dave Rolinson This was the first strike by the textile workers in Leeds in 36 years. Women and Work: Leeds United! (1974) by David Rolinson The script was originally written for Granada Television, but they rejected it initially on the grounds that it would be too expensive, although it later emerged that some at Granada were worried that the political radicalism of the play might upset advertisers. Welland then took the script to the BBC, and it was produced for the Play for Today series. After being accepted in May 1972, the play's production was continuously held up by concerns about defamation, made particularly acute by filming in Leeds, and some aspects of the play were changed to obscure the identities of the employers in the 1970 strike. Plot The play begins with a group of women returning to work at John Black's textile mill after a strike, unhappy with the deal negotiated by the union. At a meeting of workers, Gridley (a Communist) states that a union conference in July had rejected the women's request for a shilling-per-hour increase, and had now negotiated separate deals for male and female workers to end the latest strike. On Gridley's advice, the female workers vote to strike. They then march through Leeds, singing a song about \\"a bob an hour\\". They then begin to picket other textile mills at Boswell's and Bent's. Union representative Billy Crane refuses to meet the strikers and recommends a return to work, but he does meet with John Black. They agree that the workers are being manipulated by a few political activists. Flying pickets then visit the north-east and the strike spreads there. Some confrontations follow with those reluctant to strike. Strikers force an evacuation of workers from one mill by burning paper, and storm the gate at another mill. A woman who says that she cannot afford to strike because she has children to feed is told that this is the case for all the strikers. The employers in Leeds struggle to reach an agreement on how to respond to the strike. Bentham is less aggressive than Black, and wants to keep good relations with the union for future job cuts. Workers at Bentham's and Stringer's then join the strike. A week in, Maggie's mother dies and she attends her mother's funeral. Conflict grows between the strikers and the union. Although Packer and Gridley are told to demand a shilling per hour, they are willing to find a compromise when meeting the employers. They agree a return to work for an interim rewards plus negotiations. Maggie leads a revolt against this agreement, and a huge crowd at Woodhouse Moor shouts down Gridley. Maggie claims that shop stewards are undermining the strike, and the crowd votes to continue striking. After a few days of discussions, the committee agrees to end the strike. Mollie later slaps Joe for referring to politics as \\"the art of the attainable\\". Shortly afterwards, many of the workers are made redundant. Gridley is given a large amount of compensation, but Peggy is given just £5 after 26 years of work.

The play was discussed on BBC2's In Vision programme the following day, with a panel that included producer Kenith Trodd, employers and workers from the textile mills involved, and some journalists. Trodd quoted news reports from the time to defend the accuracy of the film. The portrayal of the Communist Party member Gridley as duplicitous led to the play's being praised by Trotskyist groups such as the Workers' Revolutionary Party and condemned as \\"a snide distortion\\" by the Communist Morning Star. In addition, there was some controversy on the use of profanity by women in the film (although these cases are relatively mild terms). In the 1970s, swearing was still considered \\"unladylike\\". Some of the female strikers who defended the factual accuracy of the film added that they would never swear. Roy Battersby said that he felt that some of these women were embarrassed of their husbands' finding out that they swore at work.

The county seat was Râmnicu Sărat. Geography Râmnicu Sărat County covered 3,324 km2 and was located in central-south-eastern part of Greater Romania, in the northeastern part of the historical region of Muntenia. Currently, the territory that comprised Râmnicu Sărat County is now included in the Brăila, Buzău and Vrancea counties. In the interwar period, the county neighbored Putna and Tecuci counties to the north, Covurlui County to the east, Brăila County to the southeast, and Buzău County to the southwest.  History  Slam Râmnic County (the old name of Râmnicu Sărat County) dates back to the period of the medieval organization of Wallachia. At first, the county's seat was at Focșanii Munteni, located on the right bank of the Milcov River, separating it from the city of Focșani proper that belonged to Moldavia. In 1542, when the Ottoman Empire annexed Brăila and its surrounding area, Slam Râmnic County received the rest of the territory previously administered by Brăila. In 1862, with the establishment of the Romanian state, entailing the political unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, the seat of the county was moved to Râmnicu Sărat, because it was a bigger trade centre in the middle of the county and renamed to Râmnicu Sărat, after the town. Focșanii Munteni was also joined with Focșani on the Moldavian side, becoming the seat of Putna County. The buildings in Râmnicu Sărat in which the county institutions functioned were properly purchased and equipped until 1900.Valeriu Nicolescu, Carmen Popa - „Un județ dispărut - Râmnicu Sărat.

Native Apples of Gloucestershire, Gloucester Orchard Group, p.38 \\"Chisel\\" may be derived from the old dialect word chesil, meaning a pebble, and refer to the apple's small, russetted appearance and hardness.Copas, L. A Somerset Pomona, 2001, p.22 History 'Chisel Jersey' is thought to have originated in the 19th century in Martock and for around a century was planted little outside the immediate area.Copas, p.29 During the mid 20th century it was more widely planted in commercial orchards in Somerset and Dorset, and can still be found despite the subsequent destruction of many older orchards. In the Martock district 'Chisel Jersey' was believed to be one of the parents of the commercially important cultivar 'Dabinett', a belief supported by subsequent research by the Long Ashton Research Station. Characteristics 'Chisel Jersey' is a full \\"bittersweet\\" apple, high in tannins and sugars and relatively low in malic acid. The fruit are small, green with a striped red flush, and ripen late in the year: they usually have a distinctive offset stem (hence its alternative name 'Sidestalk Jersey'). In some seasons virus infection can tend to produce small, cracked, heavily russetted fruit.Annual Report of the Long Ashton Research Station, 1964, p.58 The fruit somewhat resembles that of the cultivar's supposed offspring 'Dabinett', albeit the latter is less tannic. The cultivar 'Sandford Jersey' was commercially planted in Herefordshire under the name 'Chisel Jersey', but can be distinguished from the true cultivar by the lack of an offset stem.

It neighbored Satu Mare and Maramureș counties to the north, Năsăud County to the east, Cluj County to the south, and Sălaj County to the west. Historical County Prior to World War I, the territory of the county belonged to Austria-Hungary, identical with the Szolnok-Doboka County of Hungary. The territory was transferred to Romania from the Kingdom of Hungary in 1920, under the Treaty of Trianon. The Romanian name of the county became Someș-Dăbâca County. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the county was renamed to Someș County, and its territory was reorganized. In 1940, it was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the territory and re-established jurisdiction in 1945. The transfer of the county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was finally disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950. Administrative organization Map of Someș County as constituted in 1938. Administratively, Someș County was divided originally into six districts (plăși): # Plasa Beclean (headquarters at Beclean) # Plasa Dej (headquarters at Dej) # Plasa Gârbou (headquarters at Gârbou) # Plasa Gherla (headquarters at Gherla) # Plasa Ileanda (headquarters at Ileanda) # Plasa Lăpuş (headquarters at Lăpuş) Later, a seventh district was added: 7. Plasa Chiochiş (headquarters at Chiochiş) Population According to the 1930 census, the county counted 219,335 inhabitants, of which 77.5% were Romanians, 15.4% Hungarians, and 4.8% Jews, and other smaller minorities. From a religious point of view, the population was mostly Greek Catholics (63.5%), followed by Eastern Orthodox (15.0%), Reformed (12.8%), Roman Catholics (3.2%), and other smaller minorities.Recensământul general al populației României din 29 decemvrie 1930, Vol. II, pag. 728-731 =Urban population= The urban population consisted of 41.3% Romanians, 33.0% Hungarians, 20.1% Jews, 1.7% Armenians, and other smaller minorities.

It has solitary flowers with pink to magenta petals and one or two carpels per flower, that develop into follicles of about 5 cm long.  Description  Paeonia algeriensis is a perennial herbaceous plant of more than ½ m (1.65 ft) high. = Stem and leaves = Stems are in diameter. The leaves near the base of the stem consist of three sets of three leaflets, some of which are deeply incised, resulting in ten to thirteen leaflets and leaflet segments. These are oval in shape, with a round or slightly wedge-shaped foot, an entire margin and a pointed tip, long and 5½-8½ cm (2.17–3.35 in) wide. The leaflet stalks and the underside of the leaflets are always softly hairy, sometimes so dense as to giving it a whitish appearance. = Flower, fruit and seed = Each stem only carries one flower at the tip. Each flower may be subtended by one leaflet- like bract, but this may also be absent. There are three or four hairless, roundish, 2½–3 × 2-2½ cm (0.98–1.18 × 0.79–0.98 in) sepals which are all rounded at their tip, tinged purple inside and around the margin. The pink to cyclamen-colored inverted egg-shaped petals are long and wide and are rounded at their tip. Like in all peonies there are many stamens. A very short, about and slightly wavy disk surrounds the base of one or two carpels, which are hairless or have few scattered hairs. They are topped by a long style that end in red stigmas. The carpels develop into column-like follicles of 4-5½ cm (1.57–2.17 in) long, that contain oval, 7×9 mm (0.28×0.35 in), black seeds. = Differences with related species = Paeonia algeriensis has one or two large, almost always entirely hairless carpels of about long when ripe, and the ten to thirteen leaflet segments are covered in felty hair underneath and each long and 5½–9½ cm (2.17–3.74 in) wide. The combination of these characters is unique. Statistically, carpel size and number, and leaflet size are also in their own right can be used to distinguish this species. Paeonia mascula, which occurs over a large area in areas bordering the Mediterranean in Asia and Europe, most often has three or four smaller felty carpels, although some flowers only have one or two and others as much as five, and leaflet are smaller and usually bold underneath. Paeonia coriacea from southern Spain and Morocco has leaflets hairless or sparsely haired undersides and each long and wide, mostly two and sometimes one carpel per flower, which develop into follicles of 3½–4¾ cm (1.38–1.77 in). Paeonia corsica, from Corsica, Sardina and western Greece mostly has only nine, smaller leaflets of long and wide, and three to five (occasionally two) usually softly haired carpels, which develop into follicles.  Taxonomy  In 1887, Ernest Cosson described a peony from Mount Babor in Algeria as P. corallina var. atlantica. The following year, Jules Aimé Battandier considered the Algerian peony belongs to P. russoi var coriacea. Louis Charles Trabut in 1889 named another specimen from Mount Babor P. algeriensis, the description of which was later that year published by Alfred Chabert. Frederick Claude Stern assigned Cosson's variety to P. coriacea in 1943. It was elevated to P. corallina subsp. atlantica in part XI of René Maire's Flore de l'Afrique du Nord, published posthumously in 1964. Werner Greuter and Hervé Maurice Burdet however thought Cosson's specimen should be assigned as a subspecies to P. mascula. In 2010, De-Yuan Hong argues that the peonies from the Kabylie Range are distinct from other peonies, and restores P. algeriensis.  Distribution and ecology  Paeonia algeriensis is an endemic species of Algeria, that is limited to the coastal range known as Kabylie, in particular the parts called Djurdjura, Magris and Babor Mountains, and grows in forests dominated by oak and cedar.

Life Born at Bromley by Bow, Middlesex, on 3 December 1823, he was third son of Thomas Brown of Edinburgh and his wife Amelia, daughter of John Haig, of the Haigs of Bemersyde. At age nine he went to Christ's Hospital, where he remained, first in the junior school at Hertford, and later on in London, until 1842. In 1842 Haig Brown entered Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1846 as second in the first class in the classical tripos. Elected a fellow in October 1848 (M.A. 1849), and taking holy orders (deacon 1852 and priest 1853), he was engaged in college work until 1857, when he was appointed headmaster of Kensington School. In 1863, on the resignation of Dr. Richard Elwyn, the Schoolmaster of Charterhouse School, Haig Brown was appointed his successor on 12 November, against tradition that the Schoolmaster should have been educated at the school. In 1864 he proceeded LL.D. at Cambridge. That year the Public Schools' Commission recommended the school's removal from central London, a suggestion opposed by Acton Smee Ayrton. By circulating old Carthusians, Haig Brown gained support for the move, and also won over Lord Derby, an influential Charterhouse governor, and W. E. Gladstone, another. In May 1866 the Charterhouse governors decided on the removal, and a private bill in parliament, was passed in August. The new site at Godalming, the Deanery Farm estate, was found by Haig Brown. The governors bought 55 acres: the first sod was turned on Founder's Day 1869, and on 18 June 1872 the new school was occupied by 117 old and 33 new boys. In accordance with the Public Schools Act of 1868, the school had its own governors, and Haig Brown became a conventional headmaster. Among the transferred pupils was Robert Baden-Powell, not academic, but a participant in football and competition shooting. Haig Brown encouraged the future founder of the scouting movement in his explorations of the nearby woods. Within a few years, in addition to the three houses originally built by the governors, eight others were erected by various masters, until by September 1876 the number of boys had grown to 500, when it was limited. In 1874 the school chapel was consecrated, and additions were then made to the school: class-rooms, a hall, a museum, and new playing- fields. Haig Brown retired in 1897: he had neither sought nor received ecclesiastical preferment. Haig Brown died at the Master's lodge at the London Charterhouse hospital on 11 January 1907, and was buried in the chapel at Charterhouse School. Awards and honours On his retirement from Charterhouse School in 1897 Haig Brown was appointed master of the London Charterhouse. As a memorial of his work at Charterhouse, a seated statue in bronze by Harry Bates, A.R.A. (who died before the work was wholly finished), was set up in front of the school chapel in 1899. His portrait by Frank Holl was placed in the great hall in 1886. He became honorary canon of Winchester in 1891, and honorary fellow of Pembroke, his old college at Cambridge, in 1898. He was also made officier de l'Académie in 1882, and officier de l'Instruction publique in 1900. Throughout life he maintained a connection with Christ's Hospital, of which he became a \\"donation governor\\" in 1864. Works Haig Brown's published works included: *Sertum Carthusianum (1870); *Charterhouse Past and Present (Godalming, 1879); and *Carthusian Memories and other Verses of Leisure (with portrait, 1905), a collection of various prologues, epilogues, epigrams, and other fugitive pieces. He was author, in 1899, of The Christ's Hospital Carmen in Latin and The School Song in English; with versions in Greek, French, and German. Three of his hymns were O God, whose Wisdom made the Sky, God, Thy Mercy's Fountains, and Auctor omnium bonorum. Family Haig Brown married, in 1857, Annie Marion, eldest daughter of the Rev. Evan Edward Rowsell, rector of Hambledon, Surrey, the elder brother of Canon Thomas J. Rowsell. They had five sons and seven daughters. Rosalind Mabel Haig Brown who was headmistress of Oxford High School for 30 years, was their daughter. Alan Haig-Brown was their son.

Early life  Bass was born on April 4, 1880, in Richmond, Virginia to Rosa and Richard J. Bass. His father was a salesman, alternating from shoes and clothing in the 1880s, to insurance in the 1900s. The couple had six children and lived on East Duval St. in Richmond. While in school, Bass worked as a clerk. He graduated from Virginia Union University in 1902 and the Leonard Medical School of Shaw University in 1906. After leaving Leonard, Bass began a medical practice in Richmond but by 1909 had moved to Fredericksburg where he opened a larger practice and pharmacy on Amelia Street. Bass became the first African American physician since the Reconstruction to reside in the city and his practice was well received by the African American community despite the lack of privileges given by the local hospital. By 1916, Bass was married and father of four and was settled for some time in Hampton, Virginia.  Military career  In 1916, Bass wrote to Secretary of War Newton Baker, offering his services as a doctor for the armed forces. In the letter he dictated, \\"I am herewith offering my services for the Army Medical Corps should there be need for a Negro Physicican for that branch of Service. Dr. Urbane Bass Fredericksberg Physician\\". Bass received a commission as a First Lieutenant in the Medical Reserve Corps and reported for duty at Fort Des Moines on August 14, 1917. Fort Des Moines opened for training African-American men as there had been a huge influx of African-American volunteers and a petition was erected by the students of Howard University. However, there was still some discontent at the facility as many soldiers found that he had been unfairly assessed for merely being black. After receiving basic medical officer training, Bass was transferred to Camp Funston. On March 30, 1918, Bass departed from Newport News, Virginia for France aboard the USS Susquehanna, with the 372nd Infantry Regiment of the 93rd Infantry Division. By September 1918, the 372nd and 369th Infantry was responsible for the defenses of Bellenvue Signal Ridge, and assisted the French legions in trying to fend off the German assaults coming from the trenches not far from them. Most of Bass' work was done in the front lines in the various aid stations dealing with immediate injuries.  Death and legacy  On October 6, 1918, Monthois, France was facing heavy artillery fire from the Germans leaving many wounded in the processes. Lt. Bass went into the line so he could provide immediate Aid to the wounded when a shell blasted in the forward aid station he had been working in. The explosion severed both of his legs around the thigh region. With not many attendants around, Lt. Bass died in minutes from shock and blood loss. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross on July 9, 1918, for administering \\"first aid in the open under prolonged and intense shell fire until he was severely wounded and carried from the field.\\" Bass' body was returned home and reburied in Fredericksburg National Cemetery on July 23, 1921, making him the first African-American officer to be interred there. The Shiloh Baptist Church in Fredericksburg installed a large stained glass window incorporating Bass' image in honor of his heroism. The American Medical Association acknowledged Dr. Bass's contributions and service in their 1919 issue. In 1991, the Rebel Bowl Building in Fredericksburg was renamed the Bass-Ellison Social Services Building, in honor of Bass and his fellow Fredericksburg citizen Dr. Richard C. Ellison.  Personal life Dr. Bass married Maude Vass and the couple had four children, three daughters and one son. His son, Urbane Bass Jr. was born on February 10, 1910. He became a physician and relocated his family to Los Angeles, California, after his family's house on Cairo, IL was bombed by opponents of school integration. He died on March 5, 1996 and was buried in California. According to an article, Maude never remarried in the nearly 70 years she was a widow. She lived to be 100 years old and was buried next to her husband in Officer's Row in Fredericksburg.

Lindsay Almond Jr. on February 5, 1959 after the Virginia Supreme Court in Harrison v. Day and a three-judge federal court in James v. Almond had both struck down significant portions of the Stanley Plan, which had implemented Massive Resistance to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education issued on May 17, 1954 and May 31, 1955.E. Griffith Dodson, The General Assembly of Virginia 1939-1960 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1961) p. 396 Four legislators (some from the Virginia Senate, others from the House of Delegates) were appointed from each of the ten U.S. Congressional districts in Virginia. Compared to the Gray Commission that Governor Thomas B. Stanley had appointed five years previously, Perrow Commission included more representatives from cities, northern and Western Virginia, although many members served on both commissions.Ronald L. Heinemann, Harry Byrd of Virginia (Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1996) at pp. 347–50 Hearings and report Governor Almond instructed the Commission to prepare a report by the end of the legislative session on March 31, 1959. Following extensive public hearings and debate, the Commission on March 31 issued a 74-page report: \\"The Commission is opposed to integration and offers the program set out herein because it thinks it is the best that can be devised at this time to avoid integration and preserve our public schools.\\" It further described a \\"local option\\" plan that included new pupil placement laws, a new compulsory attendance law, and tuition grants that could be used at what came to be known as \\"segregation academies,\\" similar to the former Gray plan that had never been adopted but superseded by the more radical and now-overturned Stanley Plan. Thus, members assured segregationists that it would preserve their values and predicted its passage.  Criticism and aftermath  Many segregationists were appalled at the Commission's report for betraying the Massive Resistance movement. On the eve of the state Senate's vote on adopting the Perrow Commissions' recommendations, 5000 people (mostly from Southside Virginia) gathered in Richmond's Capital Square to condemn Governor Almond and Lieutenant Governor Stephens for supporting the Perrow Commission's recommendations, rather than fight on.Heinemann pp.350–351 Later, liberals would criticize it for replacing \\"Massive Resistance\\" with \\"Passive Resistance.\\" Former Perrow Commission member George M. Cochran later recalled how, after four hours of debate, the House approved the House bill reported from the Education Committee 54 to 45, leading to final passage 54 to 46. On the Senate side, an anti-Perrow Commission majority controlled the Senate Education Committee and so Almond's allies used a parliamentary device to permit the entire Senate, raather than just that small committee, to vote on the pupil assignment bill. To break a deadlocked Senate, however, supporters needed the tie-breaking vote of Senator Stuart B. Carter of Fincastle in Botetourt County, who had long argued against the school closings at the heart of Massive Resistance. Carter had opposed the tuition assistance aspects of the Gray plan and had recently had major surgery. Carter was wheeled into the Senate chambers on a stretcher to cast the decisive favorable vote. The bill passed 20 to 19. The following day, on the same 20 to 19 vote, the Senate approved the local pupil assignment bill. The 1959 special session established a permanent fissure in the Byrd Organization, \\"embittering old friends toward one another.\\"Heinemann p.351 The Senate's passage of the \\"local option\\" helped trigger the seemingly-inevitable decline and fall of Massive Resistance, but Perrow paid a political price. He lost support within the Byrd Organization, which defeated his re-election plans in the 1963 Democratic primary. Governor Harrison later appointed Perrow as president of the Virginia State Board of Education. Legal challenges to the remains of Massive Resistance continued, and in 1963, Virginia lost NAACP v. Button. The following year, the US Supreme Court overturned Prince Edward County's obstinacy in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. Moreover, over Dixiecrat opposition and filibusters, US President Lyndon B. Johnson convinced the US Congress to enact civil rights legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, then the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which undercut the Byrd Organization's base. In April 1965, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare issued guidelines that required all school districts to file compliance documents by July. With increased funding as an incentive, all but 5 of Virginia's 130 school districts had filed desegregation plans and documentation concerning compliance by April 1965.Daugherity at p. 109 In Green v. County School Board of New Kent County, the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the freedom- of-choice plan that the New Kent school board had enacted supposedly to desegregate the county schools on a voluntary basis and allowed white children to attend segregation academies at public expense. Arguing on behalf of the NAACP and representing black parents, Samuel W. Tucker used statistics to show that the county's plan was no more than segregation by another name 14 years after Brown.

It straddles both sides of the highway just north of where it passes between Little Pine Lake on the west and Hickory Lake on the east. It is one of the largest wayside rests developed by the Minnesota Highway Department during the New Deal, at . Arthur R. Nichols, collaborating with engineer Harold E. Olson, designed the rest area in the National Park Service rustic style. The wayside rest was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 2016. History and design The wayside rest was the result of a collaboration between the Minnesota Highway Department, the National Youth Administration, and the Works Progress Administration. The highway department was making an effort to improve highway safety and aesthetics, as well as encouraging the state's growing automobile tourism industry. The rest area provides public swimming, fishing, and hiking, and also provides boat access to Hickory Lake. The site was constructed in 1938 and included a stone overlook at Hickory Lake and, on each side of the highway, a stone council ring with a fire ring at the center. Nine picnic fireplaces were distributed throughout, and of walking trails were established. The western parking area was paved in the late 1950s. The National Highway Beautification Act of 1970 brought about additional upgrades including a vault restroom on the west side in 1974, but this is no longer present. An information board was also added around this time. Present The western area of the wayside rest has hiking trails near the shore of Little Pine Lake and climbing a wooded hill. It had a picnic area with a stone fire ring with a cooking grate. The picnicking area is now overgrown and no longer accessible for picnicking, but two remaining fireplaces are intact. The east area had a footpath following the shore of Hickory Lake and looping around a steep hilltop, as well as picnicking facilities. The footpaths are currently accessible, and a stone refuse container and the remains of two fireplaces are still present, but this picnicking area is also overgrown and no longer usable for picnicking. The south area is across the Ripple River from the north and west areas, and it had footpaths connected via a small wooden footbridge to the north and west areas. The footbridge has since been removed, and the south area's trail system has been pared down because much of the land south of the river is wet during much of the year. Its picnicking area is also overgrown, but a stone \\"council ring\\" remains.

Early life  Lorenzo Magalotti was born on 1 January 1584 (1583 according to the Florentine calendar) in Florence to senator Vincenzo Magalotti, and Clarice Capponi. He studied law at the University of Perugia and completed his studies earning a doctorate in utroque iure in 1607 at the University of Pisa. After the death of his father, in 1608 he moved to Rome and he took up a career in the administration of the Papal States: in 1609 he became referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature, from 1611 for three years he was appointed Vice-legate in Bologna. From 1616 to 1618 he was governor of Montaldo (the southern part of Marche) and from 1618 to 1619 he acted as Vice-legato of Patrimonio (the province of Viterbo) and in 1620 he was appointed governor of Ascoli. Returned to Rome, he was appointed commissary general of the Papal State, governor of Cascia and finally in 1623 secretary of the Sacra Consulta, the organ of governance of the Papal States out of Rome. It is in these years that Magalotti had a correspondence in Galileo Galilei. Such rapid career was favored by Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, whose brother, Carlo Barberini married in 1594 Lorenzo's sister, Costanza Magalotti.  Secretary of State  A turning point in the life of Lorenzo Magalotti was the elevation of Maffeo Barberini to the papacy as Pope Urban VIII in August 1623. As in use in such age, the Pope trusted for the important political affairs only on his own relatives. The Pope appointed his nephew Francesco Barberini (son of Costanza Magalotti, and thus nephew also of Lorenzo) as cardinal nephew, and Lorenzo Magalotti himself, brother- in-law of the Pope’s brother, as head of the private papal secretaries, which was the function of the Papal Secretary of State in such a time. Lorenzo Magalotti was created cardinal deacon on 7 October 1624 with the title of Santa Maria in Aquiro and on 16 December 1624 he passed to the order of cardinal priests maintaining the same title. On 28 February 1628 he gained the title of Cardinal of Santi Giovanni e Paolo. Due to the young age and the lack of experience of the cardinal nephew, the Secretary of State became under Lorenzo Magalotti the main political office used by the Pope to manage the foreign and internal political affairs. The sphere of competence of the Secretary of State however overlapped with the more institutional competence of the cardinal nephew. As soon as the two nephews of the Pope, Francesco Barberini and the younger Antonio Barberini, became more experienced, Urban VIII decided to remove Lorenzo Magalotti from the Secretary in order to leave space to his nephews in the political affairs. This decision was effective to the strategy of Pope Urban VIII to favour his own family, almost establishing a Barberini dynasty. A strategy not shared by Lorenzo Magalotti who, for example, opposed the elevation to cardinalate of Antonio Barberini in 1627.  Bishop of Ferrara  Lorenzo Magalotti was appointed on 5 May 1628 Bishop of Ferrara, formally a promotion but actually his discharge from the Secretary of State. He was saddened by such decision, and he established to leave immediately Rome for Ferrara, just after being consecrated bishop on 7 May by Volpiano Volpi (Bishop of Novara and former Apostolic Datarius) and after the formal dismiss from the Pope. He was forbidden to return to Rome. Magalotti entered in Ferrara on 4 June 1628. In Ferrara he faced the plague and famine which devastated the town, and he tried to provide help to the population. As bishop he applied the reformed principles set by the Council of Trent, visited the diocese and held a synod in June 1637. The second part of his govern was marked by conflicts with the Cardinal Legate (the governor of the province), such as Giovan Battista Pallotta, where Lorenzo Magalotti defended the rights of the bishop. He died in Ferrara on 19 September 1637, without having never returned to Rome. He was buried under the floor of the cathedral of such a town.

According to Tinsley, \\"Horror Beyond Imagination\\" was inspired by various articles about people who became \\"depressed and even suicidal\\" when faced with the fact they could not ever visit their favorite movie settings. *The title for \\"Strange Acquaintance\\" is derived from a cocktail of the same name served at The Lantern, a restaurant in Chapel Hill. The band would frequent the bar after recording sessions. *According to Tinsley, 721835 was originally going to be a concept album about a space adventurer on a planet of cyborgs as a metaphor for \\"rock music vs. electronic music\\" but lacked the foresight to successfully incorporate into the entire album.  Critical reception  Upon its release, 721835 received positive reviews. Royal Flush praised the record, noting that \\"the song writing is impeccable\\" and felt songs like \\"Who the Hell\\" \\"demonstrate Ian's amazing vocals and ability to carry the melody throughout the entire track.\\" ModularBase echoed these sentiments, adding that the lyrics were \\"considerably well-written\\" throughout. Lærke Fenger of Rockfreaks.net gave 721835 a 7.5/10, calling it a collection of \\"ballsy, well-written alternative rock songs with cheeky riffs and ambitious vocal melodies\\".

He worked on many buildings in the state, as well as collaborating with his wife, architect Jane West Clauss, on one of the earliest International Style housing developments in the United States. Education and personal life Alfred Clauss was born in Munich, Germany, in 1906. He studied architecture at the Munich Technical Architectural School, receiving his B.A. in 1926. In 1934, he married fellow architect Jane West, with whom he had three children. Career Clauss began his career working on housing projects in Hamburg with Karl Schneider, but left in 1928 to join the studio of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, with whom he worked on the German Pavilion for the 1929 Barcelona Exposition. In 1929, Clauss emigrated to the United States, and by the following year he had taken a job with the Philadelphia firm of Howe & Lescaze, with whom he worked on the landmark PSFS Building. In 1931, he organized a Salon des Refusés for architects who had been excluded from the annual exhibition mounted by the Architectural League of New York. During this period, he also briefly formed a partnership with the architect George Daub, with whom he designed a series of service stations for Standard Oil of Ohio. He also built some models and designed an apartment renovation for Philip Johnson. Between 1934 and 1945, Clauss and his wife lived in Tennessee, where they collaborated on the design of the prewar \\"Little Switzerland\\" suburb of split-level houses outside Knoxville. Sponsored by the Tennessee Valley Authority as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, it is regarded as one of the earliest examples of the International Style in the United States. In 1945, Clauss and his wife settled in Philadelphia, where Clauss re- formed his partnership with George Daub, an arrangement that lasted for two years. Clauss then joined the firm of Gilboy & O'Malley, which later morphed into Gilboy, Bellante & Clauss, then into Bellante & Clauss, and then into Bellante, Clauss, Miller & Nolan, a firm with an international clientele. In 1956, Clauss opened an office under his own name in Trenton, New Jersey, which later became Clauss & Nolan. His wife was a participating architect in this latter venture. Clauss joined the American Institute of Architects in 1946. In the early 1950s, he was briefly an associate professor of architecture at the Yale School of Architecture. In 1960, a design he collaborated on with Oskar Stonorov won the first competition for a memorial to Franklin Roosevelt; intended for Washington, D.C., it was never built.

It derived from a branch of the ruling Uí Chóelbad dynasty of Dál nAraidi Magh Line that had conquered the petty-kingdom of Eilne at some point in the 7th-century. The last known king of Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is recorded in 883, with the territory having been taken over by the 10th century by the Uí Tuirtrí. History In the mid-7th century the Dál nAraidi of Magh Line, ruled by the Uí Chóelbad dynasty, conquered Eilne (alias Mag Eilne) to their northwest and a branch of their dynasty seems to have settled there. This branch of the Uí Chóelbad descended from Fiachra Cáech (d. 608), brother of Fiachnae Lurgan, king of Dál nAraidi and over-king of Ulaid. Dungal Eilni, great-grandson of Fiachra Cáech and king of Dál nAraidi, was possibly the first of this branch to be based in Eilne. The Dál nAraidi were still resisting encroachment by the Cenél nEógain branch of the Northern Uí Néill; however, in 681, Dúngal Eilni, along with his ally, Cenn Fáelad, king of Cianachta Glenn Geimin in northern County Londonderry, were killed at Dún Ceithern (modern-day Giant's Sconce in parish of Dunboe, west of River Bann) by Máel Dúin mac Máele Fithrich of the Cenél Meic Ercae of Cenél nEógain. Eventually this branch of the Magh Line Dál nAraidi became known as the Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt (Dál nAraidi of the North) and Dál nAraidi Mag nEilne. The first reference to Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt can be found in the Annals of Ulster under the year 824. Between 646 and 792, the Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt held the overkingship of Dál nAraidi seven times, with two of that number becoming overkings of Ulaid. Cathussach mac Ailello, king of Eilne and Dál nAraidi, and claimed as having ruled the over-kingdom of Ulaid for sixteen years, was killed at Ráith Beithech (Rathveagh, County Antrim) in 749. Eochaid mac Bressal, who died in 832, was the last known king of the Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt to hold the over-kingship of the Dál nAraidi. The last known king of Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is recorded in 883. The church (or monastery) of Cuil Raithin on the shore of the River Bann lay in Eilne and was said to have been founded by Cairbre, who subsequently became its bishop. According to the Tripartite Life of St. Patrick, written in the 9th-century, the Dál nAraidi had granted this church to Saint Patrick. The Airgíallan dynasty of Uí Tuirtrí that lay west of the River Bann had been active east of it from as early as 776, and by the 10th century had taken control of Eilne. Territorial extent Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt is said to have corresponded to the later baronies of Dunluce Lower and North East Liberties of Coleraine, and appears to correspond to the trícha cét of An Tuaiscert. It also became an Anglo- Norman cantred called Twescard, which later would absorb the cantred of Dalrede (based on Dál Riata), with these two combined cantreds forming the basis for the rural deanery of Twescard. A sub-division of in Tuaiscirt called Cuil an Tuaiscirt, meaning the \\"nook/corner\\" of Dál nAraidi in Tuaiscirt, was located in the northwest of the petty-kingdom near Coleraine. Its territory formed the basis of the later barony of North East Liberties of Coleraine.

The previous school name was École Nationale de l'Industrie Minérale . Based in Rabat, Mines Rabat is one of the oldest engineering schools in Morocco. Mines Rabat is a member of the Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE). The course for the engineering program lasts three years and the admission is done mainly by the common national competition (CNC) after making two or three years in preparatory classes. Despite its small size (fewer than 300 students are accepted each year, after a very selective exam), it is a crucial part of the infrastructure of Moroccan industry. In the limit of available places candidates can be admitted to this title and by level: * Bachelor / CUES or equivalent * New License * Master of Science and Technology and bachelor * Master science or technique.  Admissions  The admission to Mines Rabat in the normal cycle is made through a very selective entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in preparatory classes. Admission includes a week of written examinations during the spring followed sometimes by oral examinations over the summer.  History  The school was established in 1972 and now about 300 Moroccan students are admitted each year. Foreign students, having followed a classe préparatoire curriculum (generally, African students) can also enter through the same competitive exam. Finally, some foreign students come for a single year from other top institutions in Africa.  Rankings  Mines Rabat is ranked among the top 2 Moroccan Grandes Ecoles, though it doesn't appear in international rankings due to its very limited number of students (300 students for the class of 2016).

Nussenzweig (born February 10, 1955) is a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Immunology at The Rockefeller University and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. He is a member of both the US National Academy of Medicine and the US National Academy of Sciences. Education and career Nussenzweig graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. degree from New York University College of Arts and Sciences in 1975. He earned a Ph.D. from The Rockefeller University in 1981 in cellular immunology, working in Zanvil A. Cohn’s laboratory with Ralph M. Steinman on groundbreaking studies of mouse dendritic cells. As a Ph.D. student, Nussenzweig was the first to show that dendritic cells present foreign antigens to initiate T cell immunity. He also produced the first dendritic cell-specific monoclonal antibody and cloned the first dendritic cell receptor. Nussenzweig received an M.D. from New York University School of Medicine in 1982 and completed his internship and residency in internal medicine, and a clinical fellowship in infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1985. From 1986 to 1989, he was a postdoctoral fellow in genetics in the Harvard Medical School laboratory of Philip Leder. Nussenzweig returned to The Rockefeller University as an assistant professor in 1990 and he became an associate professor in 1994, and a professor and senior physician in 1996. In 2013, he was named the first Zanvil A. Cohn and Ralph M. Steinman Professor. Summary of Research Achievements Nussenzweig studies molecular aspects of the immune system’s adaptive and innate responses, using a combination of biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. Work on adaptive immunity focuses on B lymphocytes and antibodies to HIV-1, while work on innate immunity focuses on dendritic cells. The laboratory has isolated and cloned human antibodies to HIV-1 and explored their roles in prevention and therapy. In clinical trials, a broadly neutralizing antibody isolated from an HIV-infected patient was shown to be safe and effective and to interfere with chronic infection in a way that traditional antiretroviral therapy does not. His research has led to the development of innovative vaccines against infectious diseases and new treatments for autoimmunity.

Uncertainty regarding the true border between New Brunswick and Maine did nothing to help the plan, as it was not until the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842 that the contention was relieved. The railway was at the centre of Dow v Black, which in the 1870s was one of the first major cases examining in detail the division of powers between the Canadian federal Parliament and the provincial Legislatures according to the then-new British North America Act 1867.

David Navarro of Slicker Magazine praised the album, labeling the music as a mix of \\"Fall Out Boy, Queens of the Stone Age and even a little Coheed and Cambria, all while still maintaining an aesthetic that feels wholly unique perhaps entirely due to their lyrical subject matter.\\" Alberto Centenari of Italy's Metal Eyes Magazine rated the album an 8/10, deeming the album as \\"a collection of hits\\" and specifically commended \\"...the good guitar performance of Tinsley, a melodic war machine in solos and a [powerhouse] in hard rock riffs.\\" Critique de Salon reviewer Olivier Dénommée rated the album 7.5/10 as felt that the album's style was \\"well put-together\\" and \\"would please nerds who want to rock... even if the band will never write something as epic as actual video game music\\".

It was suspended by the Omani government on August 9, 2016 following a report about senior Omani officials pressuring the country's judiciary to overturn a decision in an inheritance case. On Sept. 26, a court ordered its permanent closure. Closure by government The closure came after three journalists from the newspaper were arrested in the days following the publication of an article entitled \\"Supreme Bodies Tie the Hands of Justice.\\" That article accused Ishaq Bin Ahmed Al Bousaidi, the chairman of the country's Judicial Council and chief magistrate of Oman's Supreme Court of intervening in inheritance cases before the courts at the behest of senior government officials. On July 28, 2016, Azamn's editor-in-chief, Ibrahim al–Maamari, was called in for questioning by security officials and imprisoned. Oman's Information Ministry then warned the newspaper that if it continued to report on the issue it would be closed, according to Amnesty International. In protest of the order, Azamn left a portion of its front page blank for several days. Al-Maamari was well known to the government. He was previously arrested in 2011 during the Arab Spring and sentenced to five months in prison. Azamn was also banned for publishing for one month for publishing an article that was considered an insult to the officials at the Ministry of Justice. On Aug. 3, Zaher al-Abri, another editor at the newspaper, was taken into custody in the capital Muscat. Al-Abri's detention came one day after he had spoken to a representative of the New York-based press freedom group Committee to Protect Journalists for an article about al- Maamari's arrest. Al-Abri's arrest did not end the conflict between the newspaper and the government. On Aug. 9, Azamn published an interview with Ali bin Salem al-No’mani, the vice president of Oman's Supreme Court, in which he was quoted praising the newspaper's reporting on the lack of independence in Oman's judiciary and praising al-Maamari. \\"He [al-Maamari] spoke honestly and sincerely in his publication, and now as an administrator in the judiciary I do not know his whereabouts,\\" al-No’mani was quoted as saying, according to Human Rights Watch. Within hours of the report's publication, the newspaper was ordered closed and a news reported quoted an unnamed employee saying the publication was not given a clear reason for the closure or a time frame for when it might resume publication. That day, Omani security forces also arrested Yousif al-Haj, a deputy editor of the newspaper who had conducted the interviews with al-No'mani. The newspaper's homepage also stopped operating and was replaced with an image of the three detained Azamn journalists. The state-run Oman News Agency later published a statement criticizing a \\"local newspaper\\" without naming Azamn. \\"The report did not only ignore the basics of freedom of expression, but it also degraded it by utilising it in such a manner that harms one of the pillars of the state — the justice institution,\\" it said. \\"The institution should be respected rather than be targeted with deliberate accusations meant to shake confidence, as was intended by the said newspaper in its recent series of articles and interviews.\\" = Criticism of arrests = The closure and arrest of the three journalists has drawn criticism from rights groups including Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty International. \\"Hauling journalists off to prison for alleging authorities’ potential abuse of power completely undermines Oman's claims to respect free expression,” said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement. On Aug. 23, the media freedom groups Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote an open letter to Oman's Sultan Qaboos Bin Said asking him to intercede on the behalf of the three jailed journalists and grant them \\"unconditional release\\" and lift the publishing suspension on Azamn. \\"Detaining and prosecuting journalists because of their investigative coverage of a judicial case amounts to criminalizing the very essence of journalism, which is to provide the public with information,\\" the letter said. = Legal proceedings = Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri were charged with undermining the prestige of the state, disturbing public order and violating a ban on publishing in a court hearing Aug.15. On Aug. 22, al-Abri was freed from custody on bail. The trial court also ordered news media and non-government organizations not to report on the trial of the three editors. On Sept. 26, 2016 the court sentenced editor-in-chief al-Maamari and deputy editor al-Haj to three years in prison and fined them the equivalent of $7,800 for charges that included \\"disturbing public order,\\" \\"misusing the internet,\\" and \\"undermining the state's prestige,\\" according to a statement from the Monitor of Human Rights in Oman translated by Human Rights Watch. The two were also banned from journalism for a year, and bail was set at the equivalent of $130,000 should the two decide to appeal the conviction. Al-Abri, the third editor, was also convicted on the same day and sentenced to one year in prison and fined the equivalent of $2,600 for making use of \\"an information network for the dissemination of material that might be prejudicial to public order.\\" The court also ordered Azamn permanently closed the same day.

Early life Sarah Mendez da Costa was the daughter of Abraham Mendez da Costa (died 1782) and his wife Elizabeth Leigh. Sarah's grandfather, Daniel Mendez da Costa, was a Sephardic Jewish merchant in Jamaica.Lucien Wolf, \\"Mrs. Brydges Willyams and Benjamin Disraeli\\" Miscellanies (Jewish Historical Society of England) 1(1925): xx.

His nephew was Edward Brydges Willyams, a Member of Parliament and sheriff of Cornwall.Edward Brydges-Willyams, National Portrait Gallery. Adulthood Sarah Brydges Willyams was widowed in 1820. In 1851, Mrs. Brydges Willyams was an elderly widow without children, living in Mount Braddon, Torquay. That year, she wrote to Benjamin Disraeli, asking if he would consent to be the beneficiary of her will. She had long admired him as a representative of Jewish people in England. He agreed, and in the next twelve years they corresponded regularly, about their lives and the books they were reading,Adam Kirsch, Benjamin Disraeli (Knopf Doubleday Publishing 2008): 177. and about their shared heritage: \\"I, like you, was not bred among my race, and was nurtured in great prejudice against them,\\" he confessed in 1853, confident in her sympathy. Disraeli and his wife first visited Mrs. Willyams at Torquay in August 1853, and yearly thereafter until her death. They exchanged not only letters, but flowers, plant cuttings, newspapers, venison, fish, birds, and even lobster. Charlotte von Rothschild gave an exaggerated and unflattering description of Mrs. Willyams in 1862, as \\"quite a miser, starves herself into a skeleton...keeps neither horses, nor carriages, nor men servants – only an enormous watchdog to protect her and her gold.\\"M.

The band released its first studio album, Laugh Tracks, on September 16, 2016 through Pure Noise Records. History Knocked Loose's career in its current form began in 2013, but Garris has stated that he started playing with several of the band's current members in 2011 or 2012. Their first studio material was an EP titled Pop Culture, released in 2014 on Little Heart Records. In 2015, Knocked Loose released a split with Damaged Goods on No Luck Records (and digitally via Little Heart). In 2016, the band announced their first studio album, titled Laugh Tracks, would be released by Pure Noise Records, who they had signed to earlier that year. The album was released on September 16, 2016. On August 9, 2016, Knocked Loose premiered a new song off their upcoming album titled Oblivions Peak. On 31 May 2017, the band released a music video for two combined songs from Laugh Tracks, \\"Billy No Mates / Counting Worms\\", with the video beginning with Billy No Mates and instantaneously moving into Counting Worms. On 6 June 2017, Knocked Loose were announced to be supporting Every Time I Die along with Hollow Earth for a late 2017 tour of the United States, spanning September and October. A month later, in July 2017, the band announced a November UK tour, also supporting Every Time I Die but instead playing alongside Canadian hardcore band Comeback Kid for a select few dates. In the summer of 2017, Knocked Loose played every date of the Vans Warped Tour on the Full Sail stage alongside bands such as Trophy Eyes, Boston Manor, and Movements. In late 2017, the band announced their first US headlining tour for early 2018 with support from hardcore bands Terror and Jesus Piece, and label- mates Stone. However, before the tour, after members of Stone were accused of sexual assault allegations, Knocked Loose dropped them from the tour and replaced them with Year of the Knife. Most of the dates of their first headliner were sold out which allowed them to open for Parkway Drive and for Thy Art Is Murder on their European tours and also to play a few dates on the main stage of the last ever Warped Tour. Musical style Knocked Loose have been categorized under several sub-genres by the media and publications alike, these including metalcore, hardcore punk, and beatdown hardcore. New Noise, when reviewing their debut album Laugh Tracks, described the band's sound as being akin to \\"Comeback Kid at their heaviest with some added doses of Slayer riffs and Code Orange-style malice\\". Bryan Garris, the band's lead vocalist, has described their sound as being \\"sandwiched between hardcore and metalcore\\", although he has stated that the band's intention was to produce a diverse sound that was difficult to categorize. Knocked Loose have been credited as one of the forerunners of the first-wave metalcore \\"revival\\" scene of the late 2010s, alongside bands such as Code Orange, Counterparts, Kublai Khan, Varials and Jesus Piece. As is common within the metalcore and hardcore punk genres, Knocked Loose incorporate slow-tempo breakdowns into their music.

Though the building itself serves the double purpose of a granary, it was built for the ceremony of Tangka day on the fifteenth day of the fourth month, called Saga Dawa, when the monks hang on the pylon an enormous Tangka, or banner, bearing a picture of the Buddha. In the original captions attached to the photos taken by the 1938–39 German expedition to Tibet, the Palcho Chode edifice is called große Gebetsmauer (large prayer wall) while its counterpart at Tashilhunpo is termed große Tangamauer (large thangka wall)..  Inventory  At least four large monasteries in China's Tibet Autonomous Region possess a giant thangka wall : Sera (Lhasa), Palcho Chode (Gyantse), Tashilhunpo (Shigatse) and Riwo Dechen (Qonggyai). The walls at Sera and Riwo Dechen are recent additions while those at Tashilhunpo and Palcho Chode are centuries-old monuments. = Sera (Lhasa) = Sera Monastery, near Lhasa, in 2011. The thangka wall can be seen in the right upper corner. The thangka wall at Sera stands near the Chöding hermitage (Tsongkhapa's retreat before the monastery was built). The wall is a recent replacement to a scaffolding erected on a slope.Michael Henss, Liberation from the pain of evil destinies: the giant appliqué thang kas (gos sku) at Gyantse (rgyal rtse dpal 'khor chos de), in Issues in Traditional Tibetan Art from the Seventh to the Twentieth Century, Proceedings of the Tenth Seminar of the IATS, 2003, Volume 13: Art in Tibet (Erberto F.

The massive, stark thangka wall at Palcho Chode towers above a hillside in the north-eastern part of the monastic enclosure built in 1425. The building of the wall is not supposed to have taken place before the 1430s when the associated monumental thangkas were commissioned.Michael Henss, op. cit., p. 87: \\"This huge 'tower for displaying the cloth image' (gos sku spe'u) inside the great enclosure wall built around the Dpal 'khor chos sde in 1425 probably was not erected before the 1430s, when the giant Gyantse banners were commissioned. This form of architectural 'image support' was constructed specifically for the display ritual.\\" During the Gyantse festival in the fourth month of the Tibetan year, the wall is used, within a two-year cycle, to display the Sakyamuni thangka in alternation with the Maitreya thangka. A third one, the Dīpankara thangka, is no longer displayed due to its poor state of repairMichael Henss, op. cit., p. 86: \\"Because the damaged Dīpankara gos sku is not displayed, the display of the Maitreya alternates annually within a two-year cycle with the Sakyamuni gos sku.\\". = Tashilhunpo (Shigatse) = Side view or the Tashilhunpo große Tangamauer (large thangka wall) in 1938.

Spinadel, Pune Laura Patricia Spinadel (7 July 1958 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is an Austrian Argentine architect, urban planner, writer, educator and principal of the firm BUSarchitektur and of the company BOA büro für offensive aleatorik in Vienna. Laura P. Spinadel has made an international name based on her Compact City and works, both considered pioneers of the holistic architecture ideology. She is Doctor Honoris Causa at the Civic Parliament of the Humanity, Transacademy Universal Institute of Nations.  Education and teaching  Spinadel studied architecture at the FADU University of Buenos Aires where she was honoured with the Gold Medal Diploma. Her mother, Vera W. de Spinadel was an Argentine mathematician considered a leader in the field of \\"Metallic Means\\". Her father, Erico Spinadel is an Austrian engineer considered a world eminence in wind energy issues. In the mid-1980s, Spinadel taught at the University of Buenos Aires Urban Strategies and at the same time she was Director of Community Interactions for Foreign Relations and Co-operational Projects. She served as guest professor at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana in Medellín, Colombia; Università delli Studi di Palermo in Palermo, Italy; Escuela Superior Técnica de Arquitectura de Barcelona ETSAB in Barcelona, Spain; MKSSS's Dr. B.

Architecture and planning  The work of Laura P. Spinadel is marked by the pursuit of comprehensiveness in ideas, processes and results undoubtedly influenced by the anthroposophical education. Since starting out with a humanistic, theosophical and sensualist vision, Laura P. Spinadel has moved towards a holistic and ecological position, that seeks to put maximum emphasis on the health of open and closed spaces, as well as on the requirements and principles of bio-construction. Holistic thinking implies profoundly replacing rational and analytical thought with a more inclusive thinking, in which all factors are taken into account, even those that seem trivial or invisible, such as perception, health or freedom. The Compact City in Vienna, Austria (1995-2001), was based on superimposed layers, compactness and high density structures. The project required that the architects get the agreement of many public and private company-stakeholders in order to create a completely self- contained autonomous block. The result is a layered city. The Master Plan for the Campus WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business) in Vienna, Austria (2007-2015) is by nature as complex as it is evolutionary. It embodies a multivalent negotiation of scales, conceptual principles, architectural territories and operative methodologies. In this sense, the Master Plan operates as an interactive device and abstract machine, a living body that is, in the end, a subject of its own material evolution. The Master Plan as mediator promotes multi-scalar negotiations.

Five heroes of Mount Langya According to the mythology of the Communist Party of China, the \\"five heroes of Mount Langya\\" () were five men who fought the Imperial Japanese Army atop Mount Langya during the Second Sino-Japanese War. They supposedly killed dozens and then committed suicide by throwing themselves off the top of the mountain to escape capture by the Japanese. Two of the Chinese soldiers survived, but all others perished. The story is celebrated in China; a Chinese court has written that the heroes and their story reflect \\"the national sentiments, historical memories and the national spirit\\" and are important \\"sources and components of modern China’s socialist core values\\". The story has been made into a movie. =Myth disputed= Hong Zhenkuai, a Chinese historian, has disputed the myth, saying that the five men had slipped rather than jumped, and that they had not in fact killed any Japanese soldiers. Jiang Keshi, a professor at Okayama University in Japan, found in a search of Japanese military records that no soldiers had died in their encounter with the five on Langya. Publishing doubts about the historicity of the official account of the story has been implicated in the closure of the magazine Yanhuang Chunqiu in 2016. A court decided in 2016 that the historian behind the article, Hong Zhenkuai, had defamed the heroes and was ordered to publicly apologize.

Three were executed in September 1909; the fourth, captured later, was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the penal colony on Devil's Island, French Guiana, (tantamount to a death sentence, aka \\"Dry Guillotine\\"), and died there. Criminal career The four men were Octave-Louis David (b.1873), Pierre- Augustin-Louis Berruyer (b.1873), both shoemakers; Urban-Célestin Liottard (b.1863), a labourer, and Jean Lamarque. David had a long criminal career and was claimed to be the ringleader. He had met Lamarque in prison, and through him met Berruyer. Beurruyer's house in Romans-sur-Isère was where Lamarque and the fourth man, Liottard, lived as boarders. The gang typically carried out home invasions on remote, rural dwellings, where they tortured householders into revealing the locations of hidden valuables by burning their feet. This form of banditry was not unknown in France; criminals who did this were widely known as chauffeurs (heaters). The Chauffeurs de la Drôme were responsible for as many as 18 murders between 1905 and 1908. They were able to avoid suspicion by maintaining their legitimate occupations during the day, carrying out attacks at night. Arrest, trial and execution David, the first to be executed, being led to the guillotine. Valence, 22 September 1909 Berruyer was arrested on 22 October 1908 at his house; a search of the house revealed a large cache of stolen items. Liottard and David were arrested soon after but the fourth man, Lamarque, escaped. Their eight-day trial began at Valence, Drôme on 2 July 1909. All four men were convicted and sentenced to death. Armand Fallières, the President of France at the time, was personally opposed to the death penalty, but the strength of public opinion made it impossible for him to accept their pleas for clemency. The executions by guillotine of David, Berruyer and Liottard took place at Valence, Drôme, on 22 September 1909 at 6 am, within the space of a few minutes and before a cheering crowd. A number of photographs were taken despite this being against the law; postcards were widely sold, and there were newspaper advertisements for public showings of motion pictures of the executions. Lamarque was captured in 1910. He had been sentenced to death in absentia, but after his capture his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour in the penal colony at Devil's Island.

Biography  Ineke Hans started studying Art at Hogeschool voor de Beeldende Kunsten in Arnhem (now ArtEZ) but soon switched to study 3D design. In 1991 she graduated with one-off furniture and small- batch products at the Product Design Department. She moved to London in 1993 and graduated with an MA in Furniture design from the Royal College of Art in 1995. Vico Magistretti had been visiting tutor during her time there. After graduation Habitat UK asked her to work with them as a furniture designer, but soon she was also designing accessories for them. After 2 years she started to develop furniture herself. In 1997 this resulted in a self-initiated design presentation in The Tramshed, a derelict building in East London. In 1998 Hans focused on her own work and started her design studio back in Arnhem (NL). From 2003 onwards she started to work more and more for manufacturers. Her clients include RoyalVKB, Ahrend, Arco (Netherlands), Iittala (Finland) Offecct (Sweden), SCP (UK) Magis (Italy). Her work can be found in international museum collections of a.o. Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen Rotterdam, Victoria and Albert Museum London, Musée des Arts Décoratifs Paris, The Art Institute of Chicago. In 2009 Hans was Guest of Honour at the Stockholm Furniture Fair and in 2012 at the Budapest Design Fair. In 2014 she was special guest at designblok Prague. Hans is regular involved in international talks and debates on design. In 2014-2015 Hans was guest professor Productdesign at the University of Kassel (Germany) where she looked into 'unplugged' and 'the future of furniture' with her students. In 2015 Ineke moved back to London. From here she works on projects with her studio in Holland and on a research project 'future scenarios for furniture design and consequently the changing role of the designer'. To do so, she has started up STUDIO|SALON. Through columns, events and a row of round table conversations with experts in the field of furniture design, queer thinkers, international visitors and experts on human behavior and mobility, Salon tries to redefine perspectives for design and the role of the designer. This resulted in a wrap-up event in London with an exhibition, last salon talks and a Pamphlet that carried 12 mottos to act upon for design and designers. In October 2017 Ineke Hans was appointed Professor Design in Social Context at the Universität der Künste in Berlin.

In: International Computer Music Conference, 31 July – 5 August 2011, University of Huddersfield, UK. It is taught at diverse levels of musical education and used in Algorave performances. Like many other live coding languages, such TidalCycles, ixi lang is a domain-specific language that embraces simplicity and constraints in design. In 2015, ixi lang was presented at the Loop summit, organised by the music software manufacturer Ableton, where it gained critical acclaim as an alternative way of making music in the studio as well as in live performance. Mark Smith, of techno-duo Garland writes about the language: \\"By entering the name of a sound, drawing your own bars and typing notes with numbers, you can make simple beats and melodies almost immediately. If you memorise a few different command lines a broad range of modulations and structural changes becomes possible. Whatever simple information you entered beforehand becomes hugely pliable – and you can do all this to your own uploaded bank of samples. Given that just about anyone can get up and running with a few minutes, those who are willing to put their time into live coding software like ixi lang can reach highly intuitive and fluid levels of improvised composition\\". Ixi lang is used internationally, for example by members of the Quase-Linema Lab collective in Brazil, Belisha Beacon, Section 9 and Deerful in the UK, or by the Paris-based Sougata Bhattacharya. Ixi Lang is referenced in various live coding literature and has influenced other live coding systems such as Gibber,Gibber Credits EarSketch,Xambo, Anna; Freeman, Jason; Magerko, Brian; and Shah, Pratik (2016) Challenges and New Directions for Collaborative Live Coding in the Classroom in Proceedings of International Conference on Live Interfaces, University of Sussex, Brighton.

Dry south-west winds and temperatures approaching drove the fire. By Monday morning the fire had grown to over , including within the Los Padres National Forest. At a briefing on Monday morning, August 15, officials warned that the area had not burned since the 1960s meaning there is a significant amount of dry, flammable brush that could cause dramatic fire behavior. Officials from CAL FIRE also stated that at least 20 homes had been damaged or destroyed, but made clear that the extent of the damage would not be known until crews could enter the burned areas to make a full assessment. At on Saturday afternoon with 35% containment, the fire was within of Hearst Castle. Tours were cancelled as park staff prepared to move some of the massive art and antiques collection if necessary.

Patel has spent his career advising corporate leaders, raising capital to support business expansion and leading economic development. Early life and education Abhay grew up in Forest, Mississippi – a small town of 5,000 people in the heart of the Deep South. Before moving there in 1982, Abhay and his family lived in five other states (IL, FL, TX, OK and LA), as his parents looked for stable employment and a place to permanently settle. With the help of friends, Abhay's father ultimately found a small motel in Forest (Scott Motel, named for the county), which he owned and operated. The property was located on the edge of town, had 15 rentable units and doubled as his parents’ small business and home. Abhay grew up attending Forest public schools. He left Forest after his sophomore year of high school to attend The Mississippi School for Math and Science, a residential high school for juniors and seniors. From there, Abhay was able to earn a full scholarship to LSU, bringing him back to Louisiana (He attended Kindergarten in Winnfield, LA). Patel earned his bachelor's degree in Finance from Louisiana State University and graduated summa cum laude. Patel earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) with honors from the Boston University School of Law. His area of concentration was Constitutional Law. Business career Patel used his background in finance and law to work as an investment banker for many years. During that time, he helped many leading U.S. companies navigate some the country's most tumultuous economic times—including the 2001 recession, 9/11, the mortgage crisis and the great recession. Patel helped raise more than $30 billion of debt and equity capital in the private sector. He also worked on several high-profile advisory transactions. Patel's investment banking clients included American Airlines, General Electric, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Harley-Davidson and Hertz. Most recently, Patel served as Vice President of Business Development for the New Orleans Business Alliance (NOLABA), where he led the implementation of ProsperityNOLA, the city's five-year growth plan. At NOLABA, Patel worked closely with academic, business and community leaders across Louisiana to identify opportunities for economic growth.

The open pit mine was operated from 1544 to 1998. The Spanish used slave labour and free coloured labour to work the mine. After it had been abandoned, in the 19th century a British company acquired the mine and reopened it, again using slaves and free coloured labourers, but also using skilled Cornish miners and steam engines from Cornwall to operate pumps. The mine was abandoned again, then reopened by an American company at the start of the 20th century. After the Cuban Revolution it was taken over by the state. After being finally abandoned the pit is now filled with a mineral-rich lake. Location The El Cobre sulphide deposits occur in the Paleogene volcanic arc along the southeastern coast of Cuba, and are one of the few such deposits in Cuba to have been mined successfully. Almost all the mined ore comes from a central system of cross-cutting veins of pyrite and chalcopyrite. The Cobre Mine is about north west of Santiago Bay in the Sierra Maestra. It is on a ridge at the top of a valley that runs down to Santiago de Cuba. A range of mountains lies to the south, rising to the Monte Real. The town of El Cobre is on the west slope of the ridge. The town grew up around the mine. The mine was reached by mule train from Punta de Sol until the early 1860s, when a small railway was opened. Spanish operations Metal-bearing ores were discovered by the Spanish colonists in Cuba, who thought at first that they had found gold. El Cobre was the first copper mine to be opened by the Spanish colonists, starting operations in 1544. This was the first open pit copper mine in the Americas. The Spanish forced the local indigenous people to work the mine, and imported slaves from Africa. During the first decades of the 17th century copper from the mine, worked by slaves of African origin, was a major source of export revenue. However, the Spanish crown confiscated the mines in 1670 after the private contractor had failed to comply with the terms of his contract and had neglected them for years. 270 private slaves became the property of the king, and the town of El Cobre became a pueblo of king's slaves and free coloured people, a unique type of settlement in Cuba. Mining lake of Cobre mine Monumento al Cimarron above the mine In 1780 an attempt was made to return the mine to private hands and increase production. By that time El Cobre had 1,320 inhabitants, including 64% royal slaves and 34% free coloured people, mostly manumitted descendants of slaves. 2% were the private slaves of the free coloured people. The men were mostly engaged in subsistence agriculture, while mining was mainly undertaken by the women. For much of this period the Cobre mine was the only source of copper on the island, supplying Cuba and sometimes other places in the Caribbean. British operations The mines had been abandoned by 1830. Early in the 1830s a British visitor to the region assayed some of the mine's waste and found it rich in copper. The British El Compañía Consolidada de Minas del Cobre (Cobre Mining Company) acquired the mine and reopened it in the early 1830s. An adjacent concession was acquired and opened by the British El Real de Santiago (Royal Santiago Mining Company). Both companies turned to Cornwall for skilled labour and for steam engines to pump out the mines. Cuba, and the Cobre Mine in particular, was an attractive destination. The pay was good and the handbills circulated in Cornwall hinted that Cuba was a land of opportunity. Between August 1836 and April 1838 Alfred Jenkin, their agent in Cornwall, recruited 136 Cornish miners and mechanics, and also arranged for mining machinery, safety fuses and other material to be shipped from Cornwall to Cuba. He shipped clothes for the West African slaves working in the Cuban mines. Jenkin offered £100 per year plus free lodging, to young, fit, sober and single men, mostly from the mining areas around Camborne, Illogan and Redruth. Santuario de El Cobre in 1953 The Cornish miners were sent by sea to Swansea in Wales, from where they took ship to Cuba. They found a hot and humid climate where yellow fever, typhoid fever, smallpox, malaria and other diseases were common. The Cornish workers lived in one-storey adobe wattle houses on the edge of the town near the mines. Insects could enter the houses freely, bringing tropical diseases to which the Cornish had no immunity, particularly yellow fever. Out of one batch of 24 miners who sailed from Cornwall in June 1837, nine had died within six months and others, discharged for sickness, died on the return journey. The range to the south included the high Hardy's Top, named after John Hardy junior, the British Consul and a director of the Cobre Mining Company. Hardy had a large house built on the top of the mountain that the company later used as a sanatorium. There was friction with the local authorities. With little to do in their free time, some of the miners turned to drink. Most of the Cornish were Wesleyan Methodists, and wanted to hold services and meetings according to their traditions, but anything other than the Catholic faith was illegal in Cuba. The bibles the company had given to each miner were viewed with suspicion, and the Cornish had to worship in secret. A Protestant burial ground was opened since the Cornish, considered heretics, could not be buried in the Catholic cemetery. After news reached Cornwall about the deaths from fever and higher wages at other mines the number of Cornish recruits dropped. The mine owners brought in hardier workers from the Canary Islands. At its peak in the first half of the 19th century the mine produced 67,000 tons of copper. John Harvey of Redruth moved with his family to El Cobre in 1855, where he was Mines Engineer and Resident Agent of Mines for 30 years. It appears that the family became Catholic in Cuba. Mining operations were suspended in 1869 when the quality of the ore began to decline, a river dried up that was an essential source of water for the steam engines and for dressing the ore, and rebels damaged the railway during the Ten Years' War between 1868 and 1878. The mine was closed during the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898). Later operations The modern Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre In 1902, the mine was purchased by William A. Chanler, a wealthy New York businessman and a veteran of the Spanish–American War. Profits were initially robust enough that Chanler was able to loan $35 million to the Cuban government. The company used some Cornish labour, and managed to drain much of the pit. However, the water-saturated land around the pit was not secured and the mine collapsed. The church of Señora de la Caridad was destroyed in the landslide. In the period up to the end of World War I (1914–18) the copper was mostly extracted by labourers from Spain and shipped to the United States. Companies active in the mines were La San José Copper Mines and Ferrocarril del Cobre, The Copper Mines, Copper Company and the Cuba Leasing Company. After the war, operations were greatly reduced. From 1920 to 1940 operations revived slightly. In the 1940s a processing plant was built. Investors included Roberto Gómez Cabrera, owner of Rogoca Minera. S. A., which continued extracting ore until the end of the Cuban Revolution (1953–59). After the revolution the mines were nationalised. A school was established to train mining technicians, more mechanisation was introduced in the extraction process, a geological survey was undertaken and a new processing plant installed. The copper was mainly sold to socialist countries. In the 1980s the mine employed over 200 people and produced 1,500 tons annually. The peak production was 1,513 tons in 1986. Depletion of the ore forced deeper and more expensive extraction, and this combined with falling copper prices led to the decision to close the mine in 2001. From the time mining began in 1544 to the end of operations in 1998 over 3 million tonnes of ore were extracted, with grades of 2% to 20% copper. Nickel and cobalt were also extracted from El Cobre. Recent years The mine was formally closed in 2001, laying off 325 workers. The quarry filled with water, which is high in minerals, particularly sulphur. The lake has over water, and is about and deep. A large number of galleries and tunnels of considerable lengths and depths remain. A draft plan for environmental rehabilitation was issued on 6 July 2002. It covered stabilisation of the quarry, studies of water quality, covering industrial waste with topsoil, planting grasses and reforestation, for a total cost of US$243,000. Today the town is mainly known for the Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre, the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Charity.

She is currently based in Los Angeles, California, and signed with Alpha Pup Records, an independent label co-founded by Daddy Kev of Low End Theory. Career Learning to play guitar by ear at an early age, Astronautica soon began mixing her own samples and beats on the Akai APC 40. After early encouragement by Daedelus, the multi-instrumentalist was drawn into the professional musical community of California and soon began producing on Ableton Live. After signing to Alpha Pup Records in 2013, Astronautica has released Replay Last Night (2013), Waikiki - EP (2014), Gemini (2016), Gemini Remixes - EP (2018), and Death Valley (2018). She participated in the Alpha Pup West Coast 2016 Summer Tour, and has played twice at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Low End Theory Festival. Music Jim Fusilli has described Astronautica's performance at the Low End Theory Festival 2016 in The Wall Street Journal. “Astronautica spun warm, swaying electronica, then she picked up an electric guitar and added lush chords to the already-satisfying sound.” [Astronautica] “crafts instrumental electronic dance music filled with pensive, muffled rhythms that wend through gratifyingly complicated melodies,” according to Randall Roberts in the Los Angeles Times. Layne Weiss of the LA Weekly adds, “Her music is like an abstract painting come to life, with colorful, dreamy and complex yet playful melodies.” Jeff Weiss also describes her music in the LA Weekly: \\"Astronautica's aesthetic synthesizes her past influences. There are sauna-warm electric guitar riffs, moody keyboard loops, R&B; samples and the after-midnight soul of fellow LET alumni Shlohmo, Teebs and Nosaj Thing. As the elements in her name indicate, the sound is both celestial and watery -- beat as cosmic soup.\\" “Los Angeles producer Edrina Martinez has chosen her nom-de-beats quite well — Astronautica evokes not only outer space exploration, but also those Nautica jackets that went hand-in-hand with the R&B-soundtracked; ’90s that some of us hold so dear. However, as evidenced by the song below, her music isn’t some cheap throwback. Rather, it’s part of soul music’s in-progress electronic evolution…” says Chris Martins in Spin Magazine. \\"Building on the path set by the likes of Flying Lotus, Tokimonsta, Daedelus and Nosaj Thing, Martinez embraces a wide array of influences—from Nirvana to Aaliyah, dance music to hip-hop, the ocean to the stars—filtering it all into her own luminous, mellowed-out sound.\\" notes Peter Holslin of Vice (magazine). In an article in The Hundreds magazine entitled \\"How Astronautica Is Paving the Way for Women in LA's Beat Scene,\\" she is highlighted as an artist who \\"understands the importance of celebrating her fellow female musicians.\\" Nylon (magazine) also showcases the artist's impact on the EDM scene: \\"Astronautica, also known as Edrina Martinez, has already proven to be a powerful force on the electronic music scene—and she’s only 24 years old.\\" Her music has also been featured on LA's KCRW radio show \\"Morning Becomes Eclectic\\", The Fader, and XLR8R Tech Astronautica produces music using Ableton Live, Akai APC40 MKII, Novation Launchpad Pro, Push, and Novation Launchkey 61.

This is in part because pollution causes so many diseases that it is often difficult to draw a straight line between cause and effect. There are many different types of pollution-related diseases, including those caused by air pollution, contaminated soil, water pollution and lacking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Air pollution can be reduced.  Environmental Diseases vs. Pollution-Related Diseases  Environmental diseases are a direct result from the environment.

Her latest novel Harpiks (Resin) won the Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Suspense Novel of 2016. Early life Riel was born in 26 September 1971 in Aarhus. Her father is a lawyer and her mother, Mette Brahm Lauritsen, is a children's book author and illustrator. She graduated from Marselisborg Gymnasium in 1990 and began to study art history at Aarhus University the following year. Alongside her studies in Aarhus, she developed a keen interest in jazz and would often be found at the local jazz club, Jazzbar Bent J. In 1996 she moved to Copenhagen with an ambition to study illustration at the Danish Design School. Instead she ended up working at the Storm P. Museum dedicated to the life and work of Robert Storm Petersen (1882-1949), a Danish artist known for his comic strips and satirical work. Storm P. also provided the subject for Riel's third children's book. When Riel wasn't writing children's books, she was pursuing her love of music: going to as many concerts as possible, immersing herself in the Copenhagen jazz scene, joining the board of The Ben Webster Foundation and traveling with her husband Alex Riel, one of the most significant and influential jazz drummers in Europe. Career =School books and children's books= Riel's first book was a school book about art published in 1995 in collaboration with a fellow student from the university. It was followed by other school books about art in architecture as well as a number of children's books with illustrations by her mother. =Novels= Riel made her debut as a novelist with the comedic thriller Slagteren i Liseleje (The Butcher of Liseleje) in 2013, which was awarded the Danish Crime Academy's Prize for the Best Crime/Suspense Debut in 2014. It was followed by Harpiks (Resin) in 2015, which was not only nominated for the \\"2016 DR Romanpris,\\" the literary prize awarded by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, but also the Readers' Choice Award. That same year, Ane Riel was awarded the prestigious Niels Matthiasen Memorial Grant by the Ministry of Culture for her authorship thus far. The Niels Matthiasen committee called Ane Riel \\"an author of unique talent, extraordinary courage and a rare imagination. Along with her command of the subtleties of language, she has positioned herself at the forefront of her genre in record time. She is clearly not a 'one hit wonder'. With an imagination bordering on the grotesque and her exceptional writing style, she has forged a universe entirely of her own making.” Riel's novel Harpiks (Resin) has been awarded Scandinavia's three most important crime novel awards – The Harald Mogensen in Denmark, The Golden Crowbar for Best Crime Novel in Translation presented by the Swedish Crime Writers’ Academy, and Norway's Golden Bullet for Best Crime Novel translated into Norwegian. Riel has also been awarded the Glass Key Award for Best Nordic Thriller for her novel Harpiks (Resin). On their motivation for choosing Harpiks, the jury said: “Resin is written with a mischievous and whimsical élan, as well as solidarity with its characters, especially the oddballs and the anti-socials. There is actually a lot of amusement in this tragic story. Resin is written in the fertile borderland between strict genre and originality, the beloved cliché and the new code. Or what Umberto Eco calls the good balance in all good literature; the known is what is already seen and the shocking is what is unknown. It is in this borderland that the best thrillers are and where prizes are won. Congratulations, Ane!” Personal life Ane Riel is married to the jazz drummer Alex Riel. The couple, along with their dog Gandhi, moved to Liseleje in North Zealand in 2006; A busy and idyllic holiday spot in the summer, but a deserted town in the winter months. It was life in Liseleje that inspired Riel's first novel for adults, Slagteren i Liseleje (The Butcher of Liseleje), which was awarded the Debut Prize by the Danish Crime Academy.

Biography  Around 1762, at the age of twenty or twenty-one, he traveled to Spain to become a teacher of French at the Royal School of Ávila. He published a French grammar for use by Hispanics which earned him to enter the Real Academia Española and receive the title of don Chantreau. Back in France in 1782, he joined the revolutionary ideas and became an employee at the libraries section of the Committee of Public Instruction. In 1792, he was appointed responsible for an investigation to the Spanish border, secret mission whose purpose was to ensure the feelings of Catalans to the French Revolution. In 1794,he proposed the departmental director of Gers the creation of an educational newspaper Les Documents de la raison, feuille antifanatique, then wrote the Courrier du département du Gers.

While his historical charts and chronologies quickly fell into oblivion, his lexicon of the words of the Revolution inspired Louis-Sébastien Mercier a Néologie ou vocabulaire de mots nouveaux and his French grammar, of which several editions followed one another until 1926, was a milestone in the history of language teaching in Spain.

He lives in the rural land of Erris in County Mayo, Ireland. Adrian broadcasts on Erris-FM where he produces two shows Fish on Fridays where he discusses the stories behind the composers and music and The Venue - a magazine arts show. By the age of 21 Fish had composed over 200 works and subsequently destroyed them one autumn in 1977. He has since brought his output of work up to over 200 again, including twelve symphonies, organ music, cantatas and cabaret songs.  Early life and education  Adrian Vernon Fishhttp://www.adrianvernonfish.com/biography.htm was born in Bristol, the only son of Harold Alfred Christopher Fish and Freda Jagger. Both his parents were deeply involved in local amateur operatic societies, and Adrian was taken in his carry-cot to many rehearsals and performances. At the age of four, he was allowed to stand backstage at a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's The Gondoliers. It was at that event that Fish determined to become a composer. Fish started piano lessons with Gwyneth Maine shortly after starting school at Westbury-on-Trym Church of England Primary School in Bristol. At the age of seven, he won an award in the Bristol Eisteddfod. At the age of ten, Fish was sent as a boarder to Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, Bristol's famed “Bluecoat” school, on a foundation scholarship. There was no music making at the school, except for an elderly piano teacher who visited once a week to give lessons. At age eleven, Fish found himself appointed school organist. The first hymn he had to play on the school's old organ was “Judge Eternal, throned in splendour,” to the tune Rhuddlan. He remained school organist until he left at age seventeen. In 1967, the school appointed a new music teacher, Peter Fowler. It was Fowler who built up a tradition of music-making at QEH, and Fish found himself central to the growth of the music department. It was only now that he started composing seriously. Until this time, he had turned out over a thousand hymn-tunes of the sort he had grown up with, but his enthusiasm remained unchannelled and unguided. The school's new choir performed at concerts, Carol Services, Speech Days and Founder's Days, always with Fish at either the organ or piano. When neither instrument was involved, Fish played timpani or trombone in the school orchestra. He now took organ lessons with Garth Benson at St. Mary Redcliffe Church, and later with Gary Desmond at the City Church. In 1973, the QEH Choir toured Denmark and Sweden, with Fish as organist. This was his first experience of the North European organ tradition. He left school with an A in music A-level and spent a year at Dartington College of Arts, Devon, where he honed his skills as a composer, having fallen under the influence of the Avant-Garde of the time. He continued to study the organ, now with John Wellingham at Dartington. Following a year during which Fish worked as an organ-tuner's assistant with Hele and Company, of Saltash, Cornwall, he entered the Royal College of Music.Royal Academy of Music library catalogue http://lib.ram.ac.uk/uhtbin/cgisirsi.exe/?ps=vtHnhCmFS4/x/17550011/9 Under the tutelage of Alan Ridout, and guided by Herbert Howells, he abandoned his compositional style by destroying all his work to date. His life's output was burned in the back yard of his basement flat in London's Lavender Hill. Following Howells’ advice: “Write what is in your heart, my boy,” he began afresh, presenting a Symphony for Organ on the Plainsong hymn Pange Lingua for his final portfolio, later orchestrating the work as his Symphony no 1. Fish obtained an Associateship of the Royal Schools of Music (ARCM) as an organist in 1977, and graduated with honours (GRSM hons) in 1978.Dr. David C.F. Wright - http://www.wrightmusic.net/pdfs/adrian-vernon-fish.pdfFlux: RTÉ Radio documentary 2006 (producer: Ronan Kelly)  Career  In the late spring of 1978, Fish was appointed composer-in-residence to a dance-in-education group based in Lancaster. On arriving in September, newly married to Margaret Crichton, a violin teacher, and daughter of a director of the John Jameson Distillery in Dublin, Ireland, he was informed that his new job had been axed. Seven months later, his wife's peripatetic teaching post was also axed. She was then appointed violin teacher for North Cornwall, and in August 1979, the Fishes moved to North Petherwin, between Launceston and Bude. Fish found himself teaching piano at St Petroc's School in Bude. On the birth of his son Patrick in 1982, Fish became Head of Music at Lucton School, Herefordshire, and the couple moved to Presteigne, just across the Welsh border in Powys. Whilst in Presteigne, Fish was on the founding committee of the Presteigne International Festival. His seventeen-hour performance of Erik Satie's “Vexations” with co-pianist Dawn Pye made headlines around the world in July 1983. Due to difficulties in selling their home, the Fishes returned to Cornwall, moving to Tavistock, Devon in 1984. Fish became a broadcaster in 1986, presenting a music feature on a breakfast magazine programme for Plymouth Sound. He took over control of the programme in 1989, but was forced to resign in 1990, in order to devote more time to his work as a composer. Fish continued to compose until 2001, working occasionally as a freelance radio presenter. His career was put on hold in 2001 when he and his wife parted company. Three weeks after the separation, Adrian suffered a burst cerebral aneurysm. Whilst recovering in Derriford Hospital and later at Tavistock Hospital, he determined to prove to himself that he was still able to compose, and wrote an unaccompanied setting of the mass. He completed the work at home some months later. From 2001 to 2003, Fish lived variously in Devon, Powys and Kilkenny, Ireland. He bought a remote cottage in Ballycroy, County Mayo in 2003, where he still lives. During 2006 and 2007, Fish wrote “The Utterly Unreliable A-Z of Music.” (publ: Kevin Mayhew Ltd. 2008). In August 2008, he married mezzo-soprano Margaret Probyn in Chinnor, Oxfordshire. Fish's composing comes with difficulty now. He continues to keep his hand in as a broadcaster, initially with RTE LyricFM, and, since 2007, with his local station ErrisFM. He is a member of The Performing Right Society and The British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.Flux: RTÉ Radio documentary 2006 (producer: Ronan Kelly)  The Greenland Connection (Kalaallit Nunaannut Atassuteqaat)  Fish has had a fascination for Greenland since the 1970s. For ten years he corresponded with Greenland fisherman and hunter Thomas (Tuuma) Frederiksen, finally visiting Greenland in 1991 for a series of organ recitals. Frederiksen had unfortunately died a few months prior to Fish's visit, but he has kept an intensely close relationship with the world's northernmost land. He undertook ten further concert tours. In 1995 he was awarded a prestigious Winston Churchill Fellowship to enable him to continue his work in Greenland. Fish gave the first classical recital in Greenland's new Katuaq Cultural Centre in December 1997. In most of his recitals, he has shared his performances with local choirs, from Narsaq in the far south, to Qaanaaq in the polar north. He has been able to take other musicians with him on three occasions: 1998 – Rosemary Turner (soprano); 2002 - Charles Luxford (bass-baritone); 2004 – Genevieve Usher (soprano). In 1995 he was awarded his second Greenland Government Culture Fund Award, to enable him to take his second son Michael. Greenland's premier Jonathan Motzfeldt called Fish “a rational voice on Greenland’s behalf”. Back in Ireland, Adrian has lectured throughout the country on the subject of Greenland, its traditions and culture, most especially to primary school children, under the auspices of the Heritage Council's “Heritage in Schools Scheme”. Greenland remains an enormously important subject to Fish, as the titles of many dozens of his works will testify. In 2016, Fish completed the first of what he intends will be a three-volume set of his Greenlandic memoirs.Flux: RTÉ Radio documentary 2006 (producer: Ronan Kelly)  Music  Fish has been somewhat prolific as a composer. He has written music in a variety of styles throughout his career. He has never considered with any seriousness, purity of style. He admits that it would be difficult to hear a work and say “That’s a piece of Fish.” His first composition, a hymn tune, was written when he was seven years old. Up until the time he left school, he composed little except hundreds of hymn-tunes, all of which he has since destroyed. While a student at Dartington in the early 1970s, he fell under the spell of the avant-gardists, and he turned out many works in graphic form. But it was only after talking with Alan Ridout and Herbert Howells in 1977, that Fish built a bonfire of all his scores, determined to start again. He admits he cried for days, but has also said that it was the most sensible thing he ever did. His new output became simpler, and throughout the years he has simplified his style more and more. In 1986, he composed a series of cabaret songs, poking fun at those who visit, destroy, drop bombs or litter on Dartmoor, an area close to Fish's heart. Ten years later, after a passing comment from soprano Rosemary Turner, a second series of songs emerged, about Cornwall, entitled “Gorse and Gorsedd”. Fish had worked as Rosemary Turner's accompanist throughout the 1990s and they presented many themed, costumed concerts, two of which they toured Greenland with in 1998. Throughout the 1990s, Fish composed and edited much music for publisher Kevin Mayhew. Fish composed prolifically until his aneurysm in 2001. He was advised to “go somewhere quiet to live”. His current home is close beside the Ballycroy National Park on the shore of Blacksod Bay, in West County Mayo. Since his aneurysm, he struggles to compose, occasionally completing new pieces.Flux: RTÉ Radio documentary 2006 (producer: Ronan Kelly)  Personal life  Fish has been married twice. He married Catherine Margaret Crichton (born 3 December 1954) in Beltra, County Sligo, Ireland, in August 1978, for which ceremony Alan Ridout composed some of the music. They have two children, Patrick Christopher Vernon Fish (born 26 February 1982), now a fibre-optics engineer living in The Wirral, and Michael Alan Fish (born 22 September 1991), now an actor based in Aberystwyth, Wales (www.mikefishactor.com). In 2001, Fish and his wife divorced. In August 2008, he married Margaret Ann Norton (née Probyn). He has two grandchildren, Isobelle and Marcus.Flux: RTÉ Radio documentary 2006 (producer: Ronan Kelly)  Selected compositions  *Symphony “Pange Lingua” Organ (1978) *Symphony no 1 Orchestra (1978) *Symphony no 2 “A Little Orkney Symphony” Tenor and orchestra (1979–80). *Sequentia in honorem Sancti Iusti Filius Regis Gerontii Flute/piccolo, organ and narrator (1979) *St Petroc Sonata Piano (1980) *Kalaallit Nunaat Organ (1980) *Christ at the Cheesewring Cantata for baritone, chorus, strings and percussion (1981) *When Stars invade the Dusk Ten songs for children (1982) *Elegy Solo bass clarinet (1982) *Septem verba Organ (1982) *Vigilia Eight meditations for trumpet and organ (1983) *Symphony no 3 “Ilulissat” 3 oboes, 2 horns, piano, strings and percussion (1983) *Symphony no 4 “Oqaluttuat Misigisallu” Baritone solo, male speaker, mixed chorus, wind sextet, large brass quire and large orchestra (including organ) (1984) *Sarqarlit Rhapsody for flute and piano (1984) *Oferen Gernewek Vyghan (A Little Cornish Mass) SATB soli, double choir and solo bassoon (1984) *Three Trifles Three light-hearted pieces for violin and piano (1984) *Elegy Solo viola (1984) *Metamorphoses after Mathias Brass quintet (1984) *Symphony no 5 “Trisagion” Chamber ensemble (1984) *Dark Infinities Chamber ensemble (1984) *The Well Cantata for soprano, flute/alto flute, bass clarinet and metallic percussion (1985) *Moraine Chamber Concerto (1985) *Cantata in memoriam Patrick Howlett A cappella choir (1986) *Black Rock, Blackthorn Chamber ensemble (1986) *Symphony no 6 “Ordulf” Orchestra (1986) *A Garland for Samuel and Son (Wesleyana) Orchestra (1986) *Concertante Variations on an Icelandic Melody Orchestra (1986) *Le Tombeau de Clerambault Organ (1986) *Hawker Chamber opera for bass and ensemble (1986) *November Preludes Piano (1986) *Sonata Cello solo (1987) *The Grey Guardians Bass baritone, contrabassoon and 2 percussionists (1987) *Oqaitsut Vibraphone (1987) *Shout for joy before the Lord Fanfare-anthem for choir and organ (1987) *A Dartmoor Cabaret Voice and Piano (1987) *Symphony no 7 Small Orchestra (1988) *Symphony no 8 “Maigh Eo” Small orchestra and chamber choir (1988) *Veni Sancte Spiritus Choir and organ (1989) *Symphony no 9 “Granite State” Orchestra (1989) *Symphony 10 “A Little Christmas Symphony” Trumpet, bells and strings (1989) *Agiochook Piano (1989) *Symphony no 11 Solo trombone, baritone, chorus, celesta, synth, strings and recorded sounds (1990) *The Clothed Leaves Song cycle for mezzo-soprano and piano (1990) *Greenlandic Dances Clarinet, cello and piano (1991) *Concertino “Arsarnerit” Clarinet and piano (1992) *12 Preludes on Greenlandic Hymns Organ (1992) *Aasiaat Cantata on themes of Peter Olsen Choir and organ or orchestra (1994) *Kitsissuarsuit Piano (1995) *The Forgotten Whalers of Kitsissuarsuit Organ (1995) *Seqerngup kaviinnarfia Organ (1995) *Cnoc na Ria Sonata for Harp (1995) *Gorse and Gorsedd Cabaret songs for voice and piano (1996) *The Longing of Liádain Mezzo-soprano, vibraphone, alto saxophone, trombone and strings (1996) *Kaperlak String Quartet no 1 (1996) *In Paradisum Choir, harp, 3 flutes and strings (1996) *Distant Mountain Solo trumpet (1996) *Symphony no 12 “Ajoqinnguaq” Wind, harp, percussion and recorded drumsong (1996) *Nanok Harpsichord (1997) *Iorras: A Mayo Concerto Small orchestra including Uilleann pipes (1997) *Prelude and Fugue Percussion Quintet (1997) *From Ochre Heavens Song cycle for soprano, flute, vibraphone and piano (1998) *Sermitsiaq String Trio (1998) *Naalagaq tarnima naalannartippaa Greenlandic Magnificat for choir, organ, brass and timpani (1998) *Meditation and Jhala Sitar, Tabla, Natavungam and organ (1998) *Sonata “Qaanaaq” Viola and piano (2000) *Unnummi erinarsortut String Quartet no 2 (2000) *Toccata Cello and piano (2000) *An Erris Mass A Capella choir (2001) *Ukiap seqerna pukkilissoq Greenlandic songs, arr for choir and orchestra (2002) *Akunnaaq Piano Trio (2002) *Of cats, vinegar and World War III Bass-baritone and piano (2002) *O’Donoghue's Dozen 13 little Erris jazz pieces for piano (2006) *Levavi oculos Psalm-sonata for mezzo-soprano and organ (2008) *Kassoq Ice-partita for bassoon and organ (2012)  Books  The Utterly Unreliable A-Z of Music (2007) (publ: Kevin Mayhew 2008) Tulussuaq (2016)  Recordings  Adrian Vernon Fish has always been reluctant to allow his works to be recorded, maintaining a deep-held view that music should always be live.

His father was a government employee, working in the directorate of agriculture in Erbil. His father had previously served in the Iraqi Army as a soldier during the Iraq-Iran War. His mother was a housewife who Maqdasy says held their family together during his father's deployments during the war.ANB Presents Face to Face Interview with Mikhael Benjamin and Srood Maqdasy He recalls his childhood as a simple one, where most were happy with what they had. Reflecting on his childhood, Maqdasy was quoted saying: \\"We were happy and content with what we had, much more than the complicated life children are leading nowadays. We felt safe playing in the streets or other public places with family members and friends. Occasionally, there were some unpleasant events that befell our community from time to time, especially when we received the bodies of our martyrs of the Iran-Iraq War. I can't forget their faces.

He had previously attended grade school in Ankawa.  Medical career  After graduating from the College of Medicine in Erbil, Maqdasy started working as an intern physician at various hospitals in Erbil. He later worked as an orthopedic senior house adviser at Erbil Teaching Hospital. Soon afterwards, he was promoted to an orthopedic senior officer, where he was awarded a high degree of specialty in orthopedic surgery.  Political career  Maqdasy became involved in political work when he joined the Assyrian Democratic Movement in 1997. He held various positions in the organization's Erbil branch. In 2007, he was elected to serve as the head of the fifth conference of the ADM in Duhok, and three years later in 2010, was elected to serve as a member of the party's oversight committee during its seventh conference in Baghdad. Maqdasy says he pursued a career in politics to be an advocate for his Assyrian (also called Chaldeans and Syriacs) people who had suffered from neglect and marginalization since the early 1900s.
