During a total laryngectomy, the entire voice box (larynx) is removed and the windpipe (trachea) and food pipe (esophagus) are separated from each other. During this operation an opening between the food pipe and the windpipe can be created (primary puncture). This opening can also be created at a later time (secondary puncture). This opening is called a tracheo-esophageal puncture (TE puncture). The voice prosthesis is placed in this opening. Then, it becomes possible to speak by occluding the stoma and blowing the air from the lungs through the inside of the voice prosthesis and through the throat, creating a voice sound, which is called tracheo-esophageal speech. The back end of the prosthesis sits at the food pipe. To avoid food, drinks, or saliva from coming through the prosthesis and into the lungs, the prosthesis has a small flap at the back. There are two ways of inserting the voice prosthesis: through the mouth and throat (retrograde manner) with the help of a guide wire, or directly through the tracheostoma (anterograde) manner. Nowadays, most voice prosthesis are placed anterograde, through the stoma. History There are two lines of development on behalf of giving a voice to patients being laryngectomized.  Artificial larynx  In 1869 the first artificial voice box (larynx) was built by Czermak. In 1873 Theodor Billroth made a total laryngectomy (in steps) and implanted an artificial voice box. A new development, using modern materials, took place in France by Debry.  Voice prosthesis  In 1972 the very first voice prosthesis for voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy was described in an article in Polish by Mozolewski. Since then, many efforts have taken place in this area of rehabilitation. There are several manufacturers that have voice prosthesis in their product portfolio, e.g. Blom-Singer¬Æ, Adeva¬Æ, Eska¬Æ, MediTop¬Æ, Heimomed¬Æ. The internationally most widely used are devices made by InHealth Technologies and Atos Medical. In 1980, the first commercially available prosthesis was introduced by Singer and Blom: the ‚ÄòBlom-Singer¬Æ Duckbill‚Äô, a 16 French diameter, non-flanged device that the patient could remove, clean and replace him- or herself (non-indwelling). The first indwelling voice prosthesis (Groningen Voice Prostheis) was described in 1984. And in 1990, the first Provox¬Æ voice prosthesis, manufactured by Atos Medical, was introduced to the market, followed by the Provox¬Æ2 in 1997, the Provox¬Æ ActiValve‚Ñ¢ in 2003, and the non-indwelling Provox¬Æ NID‚Ñ¢ in 2005. 1994, the Blom-Singer¬Æ Classic‚Ñ¢ Indwelling Voice Prostheses was introduced to the market. Like the Blom-Singer¬Æ Advantage¬Æ Indwelling Voice Prosthesis it is only inserted or replaced by medical professionals, such as speech pathologists or physicians. In 2009 the third generation Provox¬Æ Vega with SmartInserter‚Ñ¢ was introduced. Non-indwelling and indwelling voice prostheses The two main categories voice prosthesis can be divided into are ‚Äònon-indwelling‚Äô and ‚Äòindwelling‚Äô voice prostheses. ‚ÄòNon-indwelling‚Äô voice prostheses can be replaced by the patients themselves, whereas ‚Äòindwelling‚Äô prostheses have to be replaced by a medical professional. A non-indwelling voice prosthesis has a safety strap and may also have a string with a special safety medallion that is too wide to fall into the tracheostoma. It comes in different sizes and lengths and often has a noticeable color, e.g. blue or white to enhance visibility for self- replacement and maintenance. Disadvantages of the non-indwelling prosthesis are a certain amount of risk when inserting them by oneself and the devices have a shorter lifetime and need to be changed more often. In general it takes some practice to insert the prosthesis and the ability to take excellent care of the device. Indwelling devices have sturdier flanges and can only be replaced by a medical professional. The safety strap is cut off after insertion. The choice between ‚Äònon-indwelling‚Äô and ‚Äòindwelling‚Äô devices is really individual, depending on physical condition, maintenance and cost and can be alternated over a period of time to find out which one is most suitable. Design of voice prostheses The general design of voice prosthesis is quite consistent, even though there are unique characteristics. A voice prosthesis has retaining flanges at each end, the ‚Äòtracheal flange‚Äô and ‚Äòesophageal flange‚Äô. Those flanges can vary in size and rigidity, e.g. indwelling prostheses have larger and more rigid flanges for stability and facilitate long-term placement. The flange near the food pipe (esophageal flange) is more rigid than the tracheal flange, near the windpipe. The one-way valve can be molded in one piece with the prosthesis and is often supported by a fluoroplastic valve seat (a colored ring that is tightly secured into the shaft of the prosthesis, adding rigidity and which is radiopaque). All voice prostheses have a safety strap, which is cut off in indwelling devices after the prosthesis is put in place; in non-indwelling devices the strap is not removed and is taped to the neck. A voice prosthesis has a one-way valve near the esophageal flange that enables pulmonary air to pass into the esophagus and pharynx for sound production and prevents content from the food pipe, such as liquids or saliva, from entering the trachea. Properties of voice prostheses Material A voice prosthesis is usually made of medical grade silicone rubber. The valve flap and valve seat may be made out of silicone, fluoroplastic, or may be treated with SilverOxide. Sizes The size of a voice prosthesis varies in length, depending on the thickness of the wall between the foodpipe and the windpipe and thereby the length of the TE puncture. The according length of the voice prosthesis ranges usually between 4 and 22 mm. Another parameter is the outer diameter of the shaft of the voice prosthesis, ranging from 16-22.5 French. Which outer diameter is used is decided by the clinician and/or the patient and is most often a matter of personal preference. Studies have shown that a larger outer diameter of the voice prosthesis allows better airflow and thereby requires less effort to speak which has a positive effect on the overall voice quality. Problem- solving voice prosthesis for strong candida accumulation There are even special, problem-solving voice prosthesis, e.g. for laryngectomized patients with very short device life times (less than 4 to 8 weeks) of their current prosthesis. Those extremely short device life times may be caused by excessive candida growth, so that the valve of the prosthesis does not close properly anymore and content from the food pipe leaks through the voice prosthesis into the windpipe. Some of these prostheses have a magnet within the valve that strengthens the closure, others are made of silver oxide silicone to reduce biofilm formation on the valve or use two valves, in case of defect of the esophageal valve, the other valve would seal. In patients with a short device life, the use of a voice prosthesis with supporting magnets in the valve seat and valve flap has been proven to be cost effective. Cleaning It is important to clean the voice prosthesis regularly, as the silicone material is exposed to yeast (candida) and bacteria in the food pipe, which is normally present in these areas. If yeast begins growing on or in the area of the valve flap of the voice prosthesis, it may not close well enough anymore. When this happens fluid starts to leak into the windpipe when eating or drinking. Brushing The inside of the voice prosthesis is usually cleaned with a brush, which removes food and mucus. It is recommended that the patient cleans the voice prosthesis regularly to keeps it open for speech and improve the device lifetime. Flushing It is also possible to flush the inside of the voice prosthesis with water or air. Usually this is done in combination with brushing. Leakage A voice prosthesis has to be replaced regularly, because after a certain time, the valve flap of the voice prosthesis does not close properly anymore, due to yeast and other natural sediments. This causes leakage of saliva or drinks, which enters the wind pipe and makes the person concerned cough. If not resolved by cleaning the voice prosthesis, this is a sign that the voice prosthesis must be changed. If that is not possible right away, there are special plugs that can block the leakage. The patient can insert this plug him-/ herself before eating or drinking and remove it again afterwards, as speaking with the plug in place is usually not possible. Device lifetime The device lifetime can range from a couple of weeks up to two years, depending on individual circumstances. The lifetime is influenced by daily food intake, especially dairy products, but also radiotherapyA Free University of Berlin study shows a different result and GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) affects the voice prosthesis and its lifetime. The cause of the prothesis' life time end is mostly leakage, but also growing of fistulae, granulation tissue, increasing valve's opening pressure and prothesis' loss Voice quality and speaking effort The voice quality when speaking with a voice prosthesis is influenced by pulmonary support, airflow resistance of the voice prosthesis, and airflow resistance of the new voice source. Although the voice prosthesis is only responsible for part of the total resistance ‚Äì the neoglottis is responsible for the other part ‚Äì favorable airflow characteristics are expected to enable the laryngectomized patient to speak with less effort. The voice sounds rather clear though not very loud as samples show. Voice prosthesis and HME An individual combination of voice prosthesis, heat and moisture exchanger after laryngectomy and attachment is important for good speech and pulmonary rehabilitation. The HME sometimes is combined with free-hands-switch and virus and bacteria filter.

Life  Lipinski was born in Danzig, the third of four children of the bar- cutter and model champion Heinrich Johann Lipinski (1837‚Äì75) and Christina Charlotte Henriette nee Schroeder (1832‚Äì85). Early on, Richard had to contribute to the livelihood of his family. The separation of his parents and the early death of the father as well as material poverty overshadowed his youth. As a child he worked in a shipyard, and did not receive an education after elementary school. Lipinski the primary school at Danzig attended from 1874 to 1881. At the age of 14 he was offered a short-term contract as gardener, followed by the end of 1881 as a shop assistant in a teaching material goods store with an associated liquor store. Lipinski broke off the apprenticeship in early 1882 because of maltreatment by his instructor. In April 1882 he moved with his mother to Leipzig, where he started a job in the distilling business, and later worked as a bookkeeper in the mirror and frame factory of his brother. From September 1882 to 1894 he was a rapporteur for the Socialist Leipziger Zeitung. During this period he was convicted several times for offenses against the press legal regulations, receiving fines and imprisonment.S√§chsisches Staatsarchiv, Leipzig. Akte 21079 lfdn.: 125 In 1886, he joined the union and four years later the Social Democratic Party (SPD). In the following years he co-founded several smaller unions: the Free Association of Merchants in 1890, the Association of Commercial Employees in 1897, the Association of Workers Press in 1900, and the Association of Modern Labour Movement Staff in 1901. In 1900 he was co-founder of the association of the workers' press. A year later he was co-founder of the \\"Association of the support on the floor of the modern labor movement staff.\\" From 1894 to 1901 he worked part-time as editor of the newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung. Lipinski married Selma, nee B√∂ttger (1875‚Äì1960), in Kleinmiltiz. They had eight children. His daughter Margaret married socialist politician Stanislaw Trabalski in 1921.  Political career  USPD Party Board on 5 December 1919, Arthur Crispiens, Wilhelm Dittmann, Viktor Adler, Richard Lipinski, Wilhelm Bock, Alfred Henke Eduard Bernstein, Fritz Geyer, Fritz Zubeil, Hugo Haase, Fritz Kunert, Georg Ledebour, Arthur Hagen, Emanuel Wurm In the Leipzig workers' movement was a towering figure and integration from 1907 to 1917 was chairman of the SPD district of Leipzig. Lipinski won his first political office in 1897, during a protest vote against Ernst Grenz when he was first elected to the Leipzig agitation committee. This was a minor sensation because not only the young age, but also the lack of craft training, and not long ago migration from West Prussia against him. In 1898, Lipinski candidate in the constituency Oschatz Grimma, a stronghold of the conservatives, for the first time for the diet and lost the election.Michael Rudloff, Thomas Adam (unter Mitarbeit von J√ºrgen Schlimper): Leipzig. Wiege der deutschen Sozialdemokratie. Leipzig 1996, S. 74. From 1903 to 1907, he was a member of the Reichstag, the German parliament. During the First World War, 1917, he joined the USPD to that represented the war in question is different than the majority position of social democracy. It is testament to his leader that the Leipzig SPD almost closed on the USPD joined. In March 1918, Lipinski was on suspicion of \\"attempted high treason\\" brought into custody. However, before the process could begin, the revolution broke out. Lipinski was also chairman of the party until 1933 in Leipzig. Probably no other regional party leader in the history of German social democracy seems to have been confirmed more often in his office. Between 1917 and 1922 he was a member of the Central Committee of the party. In April 1917 Lipinski with support from Arthur Lieberasch were involved in a strike against the reduction in the food ration. They exercised circumspection as regards the trade union leaders as they were also putting forward political demands: an end to censorship, the introduction of democracy. They also wanted to ensure there were no arrests or conscription of any strikers. They spoke directly with members of the local Kriegamstelle (War Ministry), who agreed to increase food deliveries to Leipzig. This news was relayed to a mass meeting of 10,000 strikers at Leipzig Stoetteritz. Lipinski, Lieberasch and Hermann Liebmann were elected to go and meet with Bethmann- Hollweg, Chancellor of Germany, next day. However, when they went to Berlin, Bethmann-Hollweg refused to meet them and they were dealt with by Wahneschaffe and Wilhelm Groener, head of the Kriegamst, who made sympathetic noises but agreed to nothing. Meanwhile, the local union leaders stepped in to negotiate a series of concessions, including reduction of the working week and the imposition of overtime and Sunday working only in emergencies. The readiness of the union leaders to accept the end of the strike without other concessions contributed to working class disillusion with them, being regarded by many as social patriots. After the end of the First World War on 10 November 1918 by Hermann Fleissner was in the circus Sarrasani Call Out the Free State of Saxony, Lipinski was from 15 November 1918 to 16 January 1919 Lipinski was people's deputy and chairman of the Council of People's Representatives (equivalent to today's first democratic parliament) and he was the first democratic prime minister in Saxony. One of his first targets was the introduction of universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage ratio for men and women over 21 years. This he carried on 28 November 1918.Sachsen gestern und Heute During the November revolution of the action slowed Lipinski workers and soldiers' council in Leipzig, and represented the 'treacherous' role of an Ebert, Scheidemann and Noske. In the days of the Kapp Putsch told the struggling workers in Leipzig, when he led without their knowledge or consent of the commander of the counter-revolutionary troops, a ceasefire agreement (similar to the \\"Bielefeld Agreement Severing\\") completed, the end to stop the fighting. In December 1918 he was a delegate to the Imperial Council Conference. Between 1919 and 1920 he was member of parliament in Saxony. He was chairman of the Independent Socialists Group and Vice President of the Landtag. From 11 December 1920 to 2 February 1923 he was Interior Minister under Wilhelm Buck. In 1922 he rejoined the SPD and became again, as from 1912‚Äì1916, member of the Central Party Committee of the SPD. Between 1920 and 1933, Lipinski was a member of the Reichstag first for the USPD then for the SPD. On 22 March 1933 he voted in the Reichstag against Adolf Hitler's Enabling Act. As a prominent Social Democrat and former Saxony Interior Minister Lipinski was imprisoned during the National Socialist regime from 1933 to 1935 in prison, he died in 1936 as a consequence of this detention. Under the eyes of the Gestapo about a thousand people gathered to pay him their last respect. Lipinski's grave is located on the southern cemetery Leipzig.

In the lobby of the Board Room of the SPD party in the Bundestag a text panel recognises the Social Democratic parliamentarians against the Enabling Act of the National Socialists on 23 March 1933. Since 6 November 1996 the Leipzig SPD-house, in the Rosa-Luxembourg Strasse 19-21, is named Richard Lipinski's house. The renovated office, retail and residential building were inaugurated by Inge Wettig-Daniel Meier in memory of the leading Social Democrats in Leipzig and Saxony. In 1945, a part of today's K√§hte Kollwitz street was named after Richard Lipinski, but disappeared in 1962. In July 2000, the Leipzig city council renamed the Ethel and Julius Rosenberg St (Gro√üzschocher) in Lipinskistra√üe.  Publications  Parallel to his journalism, has developed his literary activity.

It was one of several flak towers that protected Berlin from Allied bomber raids. Its primary role was as a gun platform to protect the government building district of Berlin; in addition, the Hochbunker (blockhouse) was designed to be used as a civilian air-raid shelter. It also contained a hospital and a radio transmitter for use by the German leadership, and provided secure storage facilities for art treasures. During the Battle of Berlin, it acted as a citadel and by depressing its large anti-aircraft artillery, its garrison was able to provide support for ground operations against Soviet Red Army.  Development  The Berlin flak towers (Flakt√ºrme, singular Flakturm) were originally built as a response to an attack on Berlin by a relatively small force of British bombers. Hitler ordered the construction of these towers after the first bomber attack on Berlin by the RAF on 25 August 1940. Although only 95 RAF bombers constituted the attack force, this was a grave domestic political embarrassment to Adolf Hitler, and in particular Hermann G√∂ring, who had said that Berlin would never be bombed. The Zoo tower was built close to the Berlin Zoo, hence the name, and is the most famous of the flak towers. It was the first one built and protected the government quarter in Berlin.  Layout  The Zoo tower was a first generation flak tower. Like all the flak towers, it had a main facility that housed the anti aircraft guns, the G building, and a smaller building that had sensory equipment, including radar. This was the smaller L building. The two were connected by a landline that was buried in the ground and protected. There was one cellar floor and six upper floors above that, though the tower rose to roughly the height of a 13-story building. The second floor was used to house the most priceless and irreplaceable holdings of 14 museums from Berlin. The rooms were climate controlled. On the third floor was an 85-bed hospital. cites  Specifications  As with all flak towers, the installation consisted of two towers, the Main G tower, which held the anti aircraft armaments, and the L tower which held radar and detection equipment. The G Tower could accommodate 15,000 people. The Main G tower was crewed by 350 Anti aircraft personnel, and assisted by Hitler Youth. It was a ferro-concrete structure. The larger tower was large, roughly 70 metres wide by 70 metres deep. The walls were 2.4 meters thick, and the roof was 1.5 meters thick. It was the largest air raid shelter in Berlin. In terms of provisions, and the defenses of the Zoo Tower, the defenders certainly believed it to be sufficient - \\"The complex was so well stocked with supplies and ammunition that the military garrison believed that, no matter what happened to the rest of Berlin, the zoo tower could hold out for a year if need be\\".  Armaments  From 1943, the roof of the facility had four twin mounts of 12.8 cm FlaK 40. As bombers took to higher altitudes, these were the only guns that could hit them. Each barrel could fire 10 to 12 rounds a minute; thus, each twin mounted battery was rated to fire a maximum of 24 rounds a minute, and four twin mounts could fire as many as 96 rounds a minute. The guns were loaded electrically, with the ammunition fed into hoppers. Younger Hitler Youth, while officially not supposed to be combatants, assisted the military during the loading process. Before the 12.8 cm FlaK became available in sufficient numbers, the tower was armed with 10.5 cm FlaK 38. There was also an array of smaller (20mm and 37mm) anti aircraft guns on the lower platforms.  Usage during the war  quad-mounted 2-cm-Flak, 16 April 1942 The primary purpose of the Flak Towers was to protect Berlin. Together with the Luftwaffe and a well organised fire brigade, the Berlin flak towers prevented the levels of the aerial attack damage that the RAF and the USAAF expected to occur, and had occurred in other German cities. The RAF Bomber Command had been endeavouring to ignite firestorms in Berlin, but had been unable to do so. The hospital facility, within the G tower, was used to treat wounded soldiers, shipped back from the front line. Luftwaffe ace Hans- Ulrich Rudel had his leg amputated there in February 1945. As the bombing continued, the facility was also used to store art treasures to keep them safe. The Zoo tower in particular stored the Kaiser Wilhelm coin collection, the Nefertiti bust, the disassembled Pergamon Altar from Pergamon, and other major treasures of the Berlin museums. There had been the option to use the Tower as a command facility for the defence of Berlin, by General Hellmuth Reymann, the Reich Commissioner in charge of the city's defence effort. Reymann had refused to move his headquarters there. Goebbels' headquarters was inside the tower, though he himself stayed in the F√ºhrerbunker in his final days.  Battle for Berlin  With Soviet and Polish troops entering Berlin in 1945, civilians moved into the Zoo tower to escape harm. Soviet troops (150th and 171st Rifle Divisions) attacked across the Moltke Bridge covering the River Spree. This was defended by German infantry and rockets, who were under pressure from Soviet tanks crossing the bridge, until the heavier anti aircraft guns from the Zoo tower could gain line of sight through the smoke. They destroyed the tanks and left the bridge covered in destroyed vehicles, which blocked further vehicles from crossing the bridge. The heavier 12.8 cm FlaK 40 anti aircraft guns obliterated Soviet armour, particularly when hitting it from the side. With thousands of civilians crammed into the facility, conditions in the Zoo tower towards the end were close to unbearable; it was crowded and had little water, and the air was hard to breathe. As the Soviet armies advanced inexorably towards the centre of Berlin, around 10,000 German troops retreated to the Government district. The tower was never successfully assaulted, therefore it was still able to provide anti-tank support to the defenders in the Government district. For example, during daylight hours on April 30, the Soviets were unable to advance across the open areas in front of the Reichstag to attack the building because of heavy anti-tank fire from the 12.8 cm guns two kilometres away on the Zoo tower., for the size of the AAA Soviet troops, not wishing to attack the facility, arranged the surrender of the troops inside. Colonel Haller, negotiating on behalf of the tower, promised to capitulate at midnight. This was a ruse to allow for the forces in the Tiergarten area to make a breakout through the Soviet lines and away from Berlin. This they did, shortly before midnight. The civilians then left the facility.  Resistance to damage  The two towers resisted all attempts to destroy them by air attack and ground forces. They withstood the heaviest Soviet gun, the 203 mm howitzer. Only after the war, with full access and planned demolitions, was the Zoo Tower completely destroyed. The Zoo tower May 1945 The Zoo tower in 1946 Explosion of the Zoo tower in 4 Sept 1947 The Zoo tower 4 Sept 1947 Post-war ruins of the Zoo Tower  After the war and demolition  After the war the building was evacuated and Soviet troops systematically emptied it of its treasures and sent them to Moscow. It was 1947/48, before the British Army blew up the tower complex. The smaller ‚ÄòL‚Äô tower was blown up successfully on the first attempt on July 28, 1947. The larger ‚ÄòG‚Äô tower required far more effort and explosives than the British engineers had expected. Initially, the G-tower was packed with 25 tons of explosives, and press had gathered to watch the demolition. The explosives were set off at 16:00 hours on August 30; however, when the dust cleared, the G tower still stood. One US journalist is reported to have remarked \\"Made in Germany\\". With the third effort, the British spent four months preparing the building for demolition. Over four hundred holes were drilled into the concrete structure, and packed with dynamite. A total of 35 tons of dynamite was used in the third try, which was successful. It was the only tower that was successfully completely blown up, though attempts were made on the others. After the demolition, the Berlin Zoo took over the land where the main G tower had been, and the smaller tower area is presently the site of the Hippopotamus park.

Lady Gwillim painted a series of about 200 watercolours of Indian birds. Produced about 20 years before John James Audubon, her work has been acclaimed for its accuracy and natural postures as they were drawn from observations of the birds in life. Several of her paintings, such as those of the blue-faced malkoha and the great eared nightjar were made before the species were formally described and given binomial names. She also painted fishes and flowers.  Biography  Inscription at St. Mary's Church, Madras Gwillim was born in the valley of Wye, Hereford, daughter of Hester and Thomas Symonds Gwillim. Thomas Symonds Gwillim was an architect, monumental mason, and builder. A tower that he tried to improve in Hereford Cathedral collapsed leading to his dismissal but he was said to be an excellent statuary with many of his works around Herefordshire. Elizabeth married the Hereford lawyer Henry Gwillim on 27 May 1784 (Henry Gwillim was knighted in 1801). Along with her sister Mary Symonds, two clerks and two servants, the family moved to Madras. Apart from her bird paintings she is known for her letters (now in the British Library) which describe contemporary Indian culture including detailed descriptions of the devadasis and their role in society. She died on 21 December 1807 of unknown causes and was buried at St. Mary's Church in Madras. Her husband resigned the next year and returned to England with the paintings. She and her sister trained under George Samuel and her artistic work may have been influenced by the works of Thomas Bewick. It is unclear if she intended to publish her paintings. Many of the birds were brought to her by bird trappers and others. A specimen of the painted spurfowl, for instance, was brought to her by Rev. Vaughan on 24 August 1806, who captured them near Madras. They had two children Ann, baptised 10 June 1787, and Henry, baptised 11 October 1789. Lady Gwillim also took an interest in botany and was in communication with botanists in the region. A genus Gwillimia (Guillimia Rchb.) was created by J.P. Rottler but this was a synonym of Magnolia. About 121 paintings from were obtained from a private dealer by Casey A. Wood and these are held in the Blacker-Wood Library of McGill University. Wood later wrote: > It has been the proud belief of Americans, myself included, that it was our > Audubon who first produced full length portraits of the largest birds, and > certainly the pictures of the male and female Wild Turkey, of Washington's > Eagle etc., and their exact reproduction in the elephant folio bear out that > claim.

Love is a key attribute of God in Christianity, even if in the New Testament the expression \\"God is love\\" explicitly occurs only twice and in two not too distant verses: 1 John . The love of God has been the center of the spirituality of a number of Christian mystics such as Teresa of Avila. Old Testament The Old Testament uses a rich vocabulary to express the love of God, as a concept that appears in many instances.Theology of the Old Testament, Volume One by Walther Eichrodt 1961 pages 250-251 For example, the prophet Hosea saw God's love as the basis for the election of Israel (cf. Hosea 11:1).Zondervan NIV (New International Version) Study Bible, 2002, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA; footnote to Hosea 11:1. In Isaiah 38, God expresses his love for individuals as well. Many Christians see Solomon as symbolizing Christ's relation to his church. The love of God appears in a number of texts (e.g. Hosea 1-3, and then in Ezek 16 and Isa 62, etc.); however, the exegesis of the love of God in the Old Testament has presented problems for modern scholars, especially resolving the references to produce a consistent interpretation has been challenging and subject to debate.Theologies in the Old Testament by Erhard Gerstenberger 2007 page 87 According to Psalms 5, God hates all workers of iniquity: New Testament Both the terms love of God and love of Christ appear in the New Testament. In cases such as in Romans 8:35 and Romans 8:39 their use is related in the experience of the believer, without asserting their equality.Romans 8:39The Epistle to the Romans by Douglas J. Moo 1996 page 547 In John 14:31 Jesus expresses his love for God the Father.John 14:31 This verse includes the only direct statement by Jesus in the New Testament about Jesus' love for the God the Father.Preaching the Gospel of John: proclaiming the living Word by Lamar Williamson 2004 page 192 The love of the Father for his Son (Jesus Christ) is expressed in Matthew 3:17 by a voice from Heaven during the Baptism of Jesus.Mathew 3:17Lectures in Systematic Theology by Henry C. Thiessen 1989 page 86 The same sentiment is later expressed during the Transfiguration of Jesus in Mark 9:7, where a voice from Heaven tells the three disciples: \\"This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!\\"Mark 9:7 Love is a key attribute of God in Christianity. 1 John 4:8 and 16 state that \\"God is love; and he who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.\\"1 John 4:8 and 16Christian Theology by Millard J. Erickson 1998 page 318 John 3:16 states: \\"God so loved the world...\\" In the New Testament, God's love for humanity or the world is expressed in Greek as agape (). The same Greek word agape is used also of the love of Christians for one another and for other human beings, as in 1 Thessalonians 3:12: \\"May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else.\\" The corresponding verb agap≈ç () is used not only of God's love and of the mutual love of Christians, but also of Christians' love for God, as in 1 John 4:21: \\"And he has given us this command: Whoever loves God must also love his brother.\\" Christian mysticism The experience of God's love is a central part in most traditions of Christian mysticism. This experience of God's love plays a central role in the Spiritual Exercises, which are the foundation of Ignatian spirituality. God's love also plays an important part in the writings of Medieval German mystics, such as Mechthild of Magdeburg and Hildegard von Bingen, who describe divine love as a burning passion. Julian of Norwich expresses the same sentiment in her Sixteen Revelations of Divine Love (c. 1393). Thomas Aquinas taught that the essence of sanctity lies in love of God, and Th√©r√®se of Lisieux made love of God the center of her spirituality.The Story of a Soul See also * Agape * Love of Christ * Love of God * References External links * WELS Topical Q&A;: God in Old Testament / God in New Testament, by Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (Confessional Lutheran perspective) * God Is Love: His Love in Action Category:Attributes of God in Christian theology Category:Christian terminology Category:Philosophy of love ","title":"Love of God in Christianity"},{"id":"34346364","text":"Gesonia obeditalis is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae first described by Francis Walker in 1859.

He studied at maktab, in Shusha. From the beginning of the 19th century, he was in the governmental and military-administrative service of Russia. He was captain of the Imperial Russian Army. Initial period of the service In 1795, with the approach of Mohammad Khan Qajar‚Äôs troops to Karabakh, Mirza Adigozel bey left Karabakh and resettled to Kartli-Kakheti (eastern Georgia) with his family and ilats (nomads) who depended on them and lived apparently in Iyirmidordskiy (Twenty fourth) mahal located near the Aras river. After the annexation of Kartli- Kakheti by Russia in 1801, minister Kovalenskiy accepted Mirza Adigozal bey, to service for conducting secret affairs by correspondence in Tiflis. Adigozel bey served at Kovalenskiy secretly. He got a salary for the service. Obviously, he held the position during late 1799 and all 1800. From that time Mirza Adigozal bey linked his destiny to the Russian administration and Russian troops in the South Caucasus for a long time. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1806‚Äì1812, he held the position of translator-clerk at major-general D. Lisanevich.

Mehdigulu Khan of Karabakh granted bey lands, which belonged to their family, and also a lot of populated areas and appointed him a naib of Iyirmidordskiy mahal. He was in service of protection of boundaries of Karabakh for three years, from 1823 to 1826, by order of general Yermolov.

Iranian troops moved into Shuragel and Pambak and also into Talysh and Karabakh. Frontier posts, which hadn‚Äôt got enough strength made a fighting retreat far inland. Mirza Adigozal bey and his entrusted detachments‚Äô cutting off from communication with Shusha and Tiflis, was a result of earlier invasion of Iranian troops into the post near Bazirgan spring which was located near the very border. The circumstances became complicated when certain groups of local population, depending on that stratum which was closely related to khan‚Äôs power during the reign of khans, became turncoat and allured some part of nomads during the invasion of troops of the enemy. After the liquidation of khan administration, these insignificant number of strata of yuzbashis, maafs, ketkhudas, and some part of beys, losing their former preferred positions and sources of material welfare, attempted to return the old rules. They expected that Iranian troops will re-establish the former structure of government and return them their lost welfare. They knew that Mehdigulu khan of Karabakh was among the troops of Abbas Mirza-legatee of Iranian throne. After that, Mirze Adigozel bey decided to appear on the bid of the Prince Royal.

In that very year, Mirza Adigozal bey crossed into the home front of the enemy under the command of Prince Ivan Abkhazov, and beyond the river Aras met Mehdigulu khan and inclined him to across to the Russia. Highly appreciating his services in execution of the order related to drawing Mehdigulu khan to Russian side, general Paskevich conferred Mirza Adigozal bey with prize.

Retirement from military service In late 1829 and early 1830, Mirza Adigozal bey retired after serving for 30 years. In the 1830s, Mirza Adigozal bey worked at provincial court of Karabakh, which gave him an opportunity to become familiar with historically well-established conditions and character of population‚Äôs economic activity in different parts of the province and with traditions of this place. Deep respect to eminent personalities of the past initiated Mirza Adigozal bey to construct a new mausoleum on great Nizami‚Äôs grave, instead of the old one, which had already destroyed. Mirza Adigozal bey wrote his poem ‚ÄúGarabaghname‚Äù in advanced ages (about 65 years old). Mirza Adigozal bey died on September 9, 1848, and was buried in a cemetery of Rahimli village, which was located not far from Goranboy. A mausoleum was erected on his grave.

Its main features are that it is direct (that is, non- iterative) and that it mathematically guarantees a consistent selection of the correct operative branch of the multivalued problem, also signalling the condition of voltage collapse when there is no solution. These properties are relevant not only for the reliability of existing off-line and real-time applications, but also because they enable new types of analytical tools that would be impossible to build with existing iterative load flow methods (due to their convergence problems). An example of this would be decision-support tools providing validated action plans in real time. The HELM load flow algorithm was invented by Antonio Trias and has been granted two US Patents. A detailed description was presented at the 2012 IEEE PES General Meeting and subsequently published.A. Trias, \\"The Holomorphic Embedding Load Flow Method\\", IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011, 22‚Äì26 July 2012. The method is founded on advanced concepts and results from complex analysis, such as holomorphicity, the theory of algebraic curves, and analytic continuation. However, the numerical implementation is rather straightforward as it uses standard linear algebra and the Pad√© approximation. Additionally, since the limiting part of the computation is the factorization of the admittance matrix and this is done only once, its performance is competitive with established fast-decoupled loadflows. The method is currently implemented into industrial- strength real-time and off-line packaged EMS applications.  Background  The load-flow calculation is one of the most fundamental components in the analysis of power systems and is the cornerstone for almost all other tools used in power system simulation and management. The load-flow equations can be written in the following general form: V_i = \\\\frac{S_i^*}{V_i^*}|}} where the given (complex) parameters are the admittance matrix , the bus shunt admittances , and the bus power injections representing constant-power loads and generators. To solve this non-linear system of algebraic equations, traditional load-flow algorithms were developed based on three iterative techniques: the Gauss-Seidel method J. B. Ward and H. W.

Alsac, \\"Fast Decoupled Load Flow,\\" IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems, vol. PAS-93, no.3, pp.859-869, May 1974. , which is based on Newton-Raphson, but greatly reduces its computational cost by means of a decoupling approximation that is valid in most transmission networks. Many other incremental improvements exist; however, the underlying technique in all of them is still an iterative solver, either of Gauss-Seidel or of Newton type. There are two fundamental problems with all iterative schemes of this type. On the one hand, there is no guarantee that the iteration will always converge to a solution; on the other, since the system has multiple solutions,It is well-known that the load flow equations for a power system have multiple solutions. For a network with non- swing buses, the system may have up to possible solutions, but only one is actually possible in the real electrical system. This fact is used in stability studies, see for instance: Y. Tamura, H. Mori, and S. Iwamoto,\\"Relationship Between Voltage Instability and Multiple Load Flow Solutions in Electric Power Systems\\", IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems, vol. PAS-102 , no.5, pp.1115-1125, 1983. it is not possible to control which solution will be selected. As the power system approaches the point of voltage collapse, spurious solutions get closer to the correct one, and the iterative scheme may be easily attracted to one of them because of the phenomenon of Newton fractals: when the Newton method is applied to complex functions, the basins of attraction for the various solutions show fractal behavior.This is a general phenomenon affecting the Newton-Raphson method when applied to equations in complex variables. See for instance Newton's method#Complex functions. As a result, no matter how close the chosen initial point of the iterations (seed) is to the correct solution, there is always some non-zero chance of straying off to a different solution. These fundamental problems of iterative loadflows have been extensively documented.R. Klump and T.

A simple illustration for the two-bus model is provided inProblems with Iterative Load Flow , Elequant, 2010. Although there exist homotopic continuation techniques that alleviate the problem to some degree,V. Ajjarapu and C. Christy, \\"The continuation power flow: A tool for steady state voltage stability analysis\\", IEEE Trans. on Power Systems, vol.7, no.1, pp. 416-423, Feb 1992. the fractal nature of the basins of attraction precludes a 100% reliable method for all electrical scenarios. The key differential advantage of the HELM is that it is fully deterministic and unambiguous: it guarantees that the solution always corresponds to the correct operative solution, when it exists; and it signals the non-existence of the solution when the conditions are such that there is no solution (voltage collapse). Additionally, the method is competitive with the FDNR method in terms of computational cost. It brings a solid mathematical treatment of the load-flow problem that provides new insights not previously available with the iterative numerical methods.  Methodology and applications  HELM is grounded on a rigorous mathematical theory, and in practical terms it could be summarized as follows: # Define a specific (holomorphic) embedding for the equations in terms of a complex parameter , such that for the system has an obvious correct solution, and for one recovers the original problem. # Given this holomorphic embedding, it is now possible to compute univocally power series for voltages as analytic functions of . The correct load-flow solution at will be obtained by analytic continuation of the known correct solution at . # Perform the analytic continuation using algebraic approximants, which in this case are guaranteed to either converge to the solution if it exists, or not converge if the solution does not exist (voltage collapse). HELM provides a solution to a long-standing problem of all iterative load-flow methods, namely the unreliability of the iterations in finding the correct solution (or any solution at all). This makes HELM particularly suited for real-time applications, and mandatory for any EMS software based on exploratory algorithms, such as contingency analysis, and under alert and emergency conditions solving operational limits violations and restoration providing guidance through action plans.  Holomorphic embedding  For the purposes of the discussion, we will omit the treatment of controls, but the method can accommodate all types of controls. For the constraint equations imposed by these controls, an appropriate holomorphic embedding must be also defined. The method uses an embedding technique by means of a complex parameter . The first key ingredient in the method lies in requiring the embedding to be holomorphic, that is, that the system of equations for voltages is turned into a system of equations for functions in such a way that the new system defines as holomorphic functions (i.e. complex analytic) of the new complex variable . The aim is to be able to use the process of analytic continuation which will allow the calculation of at . Looking at equations (), a necessary condition for the embedding to be holomorphic is that is replaced under the embedding with , not . This is because complex conjugation itself is not a holomorphic function. On the other hand, it is easy to see that the replacement does allow the equations to define a holomorphic function . However, for a given arbitrary embedding, it remains to be proven that is indeed holomorphic. Taking into account all these considerations, an embedding of this type is proposed: V_i(s) = s\\\\frac{S_i^*}{V_i ^*(s^*)}|}} With this choice, at the right hand side terms become zero, (provided that the denominator is not zero), this corresponds to the case where all the injections are zero and this case has a well known and simple operational solution: all voltages are equal and all flow intensities are zero. Therefore, this choice for the embedding provides at s=0 a well known operational solution. Now using classical techniques for variable elimination in polynomial systemsB. Sturmfels, \\"Solving Systems of Polynomial Equations‚Äù, CBMS Regional Conference Series in Mathematics 97, AMS, 2002. (results from the theory of Resultants and Gr√∂bner basis it can be proven that equations () do in fact define as holomorphic functions. More significantly, they define as algebraic curves. It is this specific fact, which becomes true because the embedding is holomorphic that guarantees the uniqueness of the result. The solution at determines uniquely the solution everywhere (except on a finite number of branch cuts), thus getting rid of the multi-valuedness of the load-flow problem. The technique to obtain the coefficients for the power series expansion (on ) of voltages is quite straightforward, once one realizes that equations () can be used to obtain them order after order. Consider the power series expansion for \\\\textstyle V(s)=\\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty a[n] s^n and \\\\textstyle 1/V(s)=\\\\sum_{n = 0}^\\\\infty b[n] s^n. By substitution into equations () and identifying terms at each order in , one obtains: a_i[n] = S_i^* b_i^*[n-1] \\\\qquad (n=0, \\\\ldots, \\\\infty)|}} It is then straightforward to solve the sequence of linear systems () successively order after order, starting from . Note that the coefficients of the expansions for and are related by the simple convolution formulas derived from the following identity: so that the right-hand side in () can always be calculated from the solution of the system at the previous order. Note also how the procedure works by solving just linear systems, in which the matrix remains constant. A more detailed discussion about this procedure is offered in Ref.  Analytic continuation  Once the power series at are calculated to the desired order, the problem of calculating them at becomes one of analytic continuation. It should be strongly remarked that this does not have anything in common with the techniques of homotopic continuation. Homotopy is powerful since it only makes use of the concept of continuity and thus it is applicable to general smooth nonlinear systems, but on the other hand it does not always provide a reliable method to approximate the functions (as it relies on iterative schemes such as Newton-Raphson). It can be provenL. Ahlfors, Complex analysis (3rd ed.), McGraw Hill, 1979. that algebraic curves are complete global analytic functions, that is, knowledge of the power series expansion at one point (the so-called germ of the function) uniquely determines the function everywhere on the complex plane, except on a finite number of branch cuts. Stahl's extremal domain theoremG. A. Baker Jr and P. Graves-Morris, Pad√© Approximants (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications), Cambridge University Press, Second Ed. 2010, p. 326. further asserts that there exists a maximal domain for the analytic continuation of the function, which corresponds to the choice of branch cuts with minimal logarithmic capacity measure. In the case of algebraic curves the number of cuts is finite, therefore it would be feasible to find maximal continuations by finding the combination of cuts with minimal capacity. For further improvements, Stahl's theorem on the convergence of Pad√© ApproximantsH. Stahl, ‚ÄúThe Convergence of Pad√© Approximants to Functions with Branch Points‚Äù, J. Approx. Theory, 91 (1997), 139-204. * G. A. Baker Jr and P. Graves-Morris, Pad√© Approximants (Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications), Cambridge University Press, Second Ed. 2010, p. 326-330. states that the diagonal and supra-diagonal Pad√© (or equivalently, the continued fraction approximants to the power series) converge to the maximal analytic continuation. The zeros and poles of the approximants remarkably accumulate on the set of branch cuts having minimal capacity. These properties confer the load-flow method with the ability to unequivocally detect the condition of voltage collapse: the algebraic approximations are guaranteed to either converge to the solution if it exists, or not converge if the solution does not exist.

The Sojomerto inscription is an inscription discovered in Sojomerto village, Reban, Batang Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. Written in Old Malay using the Kawi script, it was initially dated to ' the 7th century, but later redated, on palaeographic grounds, to the early 9th century. The inscription is currently in situ or on location. The inscription is Shivaist in nature, talking about the head of a noble family named Dapunta Selendra, the son of Santanu and Bhadrawati, the husband of Sampula. Boechari speculates that Dapunta Selendra was the progenitor of the Sailendras, an influential family who would later rule Medang Kingdom and Srivijaya. The inscription was carved on an andesite stone 43 cm wide, 7 cm thick, and 78 cm tall.Situs Kabupaten Batang, diakses 7 Juni 2007 The text consists of 11 lines, most of them being unclear and eroded.

This inscription concluded that the family of Dapunta Selendra is settled at the north coast of Central Java, speak Old Malay and that they are Shivaist Hindus. The discovery of this inscription has led to the development of theories proposing a Sumatran origin of the Sailendras, also with the possibility of their initial establishment at the north coast of Central Java before moving inland to Kedu Plain. Just like the Sojomerto inscription, some of Sailendra's inscriptions of the later period‚Äîalthough discovered in Central Java‚Äîare also written in Old Malay instead of Old Javanese, which suggested Sumatran connections. The name 'Selendra' mentioned in this inscription as \\"Dapunta Selendra\\" is suggested as the ancestor of the Sailendras. The title 'Dapunta' is similar to those of Srivijayan King Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa, which suggested the Srivijayan connection to Sailendra family. The family was first settled in Central Java northern coast around Batang and Pekalongan regency, they were initially Hindu Shivaist. At a certain point of time they moved southward and established themselves in Kedu Plain and later probably converted to Mahayana Buddhism. Another interpretation suggests that the family was probably a native Javanese family, but having Srivijayan connection. This ruling family was probably a local ruler but somehow subjugated by Srivijayan through invasion and served as Srivijayan vassal. The early Sailendras were probably belongs within Srivijaya's mandala sphere of influence. Previously known through Kota Kapur inscription (686 CE) that Srivijaya launched series of military campaign against Bhumi Java, which also corresponds to the fall of Tarumanagara kingdom in West Java.

In 1993 under the brand name Nanosensors they became the first commercialized SPM and AFM probes worldwide. The development and introduction of batch processing to producing AFM probes was a crucial step to the introduction of the Atomic Force Microscope into the high tech industry. In recognition of this achievement, Nanosensors has been discerned the Dr.-Rudolf-Eberle Innovation Award of the German State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg Dr.-Rudolf-Eberle-Preis ‚Äì Innovationspreis des Landes Baden W√ºrttemberg, Auszeichungen, Preistr√§ger 1995 in 1995, the Innovation Prize of the German Industry Innovationspreis der deutschen Wirtschaft, Erster Innovationspreis der Welt, Preistr√§ger der Vorjahre, 1995 in 1995 as well as the Innovation Award of the F√∂rderkreis f√ºr die Mikroelektronik e.V.Annual Innovation Award of the F√∂rderkreis Mikroelektronik, Industrie- und Handelskammer N√ºrnberg f√ºr Mittelfranken in 1999.

The album received positive reviews from critics, although some criticized its songs for being too long. Despite its critical success, it was Coxon's least successful album on the UK Albums Chart since The Kiss of Morning, peaking at number 39 and staying on the chart for only one week. Background A+E started as a \\"reaction\\" against Coxon's previous album, The Spinning Top, a mostly acoustic album. According to Coxon, the songs were difficult to play, resulting in some audiences being unsatisfied in \\"venues that weren't set up for that sort of thing\\". Producer Ben Hillier described the recording of the album as \\"quick\\" and \\"fun\\", due to him trying to record Coxon's first takes on songs when it was possible. In 2 months, Coxon was able to record 21 tracks; 10 of them made it onto A+E, while the other 11 were grouped into an album that was expected be released in late 2012. According to Hillier, the latter is \\"less riff-based\\" and more \\"soul- influenced, with backing singers and strings. Composition The title of A+E refers to Accident and Emergency rooms, while its cover art is a picture of a scraped knee. Coxon himself took the picture. Most of the songs on it feature synths and drum machine beats. The single \\"What'll It Take\\" is an upbeat song that features two vocal hooks: \\"What'll it take to make you people dance?\\" and \\"I don't know what's really wrong with me\\". A music video was released for it. \\"Seven Naked Valleys\\" is a post-punk track featuring saxophone that ends with \\"piercing synth frequency\\". Opening track \\"Advice\\" and \\"Running for Your Life\\" have \\"buzzsaw-guitar\\" and sardonic lyrics on culture. The former's lyrics are about a bad experience Coxon had at a house party in Brentwood, Essex. At the party, he and some other friends danced to a Smiths record that they used to replace another tape which was playing. As a result, they got beaten up and spent the rest of the night walking around Brentwood thinking of how they would get home. The latter's lyrics are about the \\"violence of a suburban night out.\\" \\"Bah Singer\\" has indecipherable distorted lyrics, and the following track, \\"Knife in the Cast\\", is a ballad driven by bass guitar. The final track, \\"Ooh, Yeh Yeh\\", is a grunge-pop song that has been described as a \\"cowboy lullaby\\". Reception A+E received positive reviews from critics, indicated by a score of 76 on review aggregate site upon which was voted Metacritic, denoting \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five, writing \\"Beneath all the clatter, A+E has the pop punch of his pair of Stephen Street-music production mid-2000s masterworks Happiness in Magazines and Love Travels at Illegal Speeds, and the combination of precisely crafted pop and fiercely imaginative arrangements results in a thrilling listen.\\"Stephen Thomas Erlewine. The NME wrote that \\"the sulky, surly, passive-aggressive Graham we know and love has returned with a vengeance, and rediscovered his finest bomb- blast guitar work.\\" Its reviewer Tom Pinnock called the album \\"one of the best albums of [Coxon's] career ‚Äì a pop record with dangerously anti-social tendencies.\\" The Guardian gave A+E four out of five stars, writing \\"Coxon's wilfully abrasive eighth solo album might bring him full circle, but it also sends him spiralling into thrilling new territory.\\" Pitchfork was not as positive and gave it 6.7 out of 10 commenting that a listener would be \\"left wishing the album drew a little more blood to make the stay truly worthwhile.\\" Publications like The Independent were even less favorable; reviewer Andy Gill stated that \\"lingering this long among a cast of 'wasted people in a wasted world' leaves a grim aftertaste\\", although he did name \\"Running for Your Life\\", \\"Meet and Drink and Pollinate\\", and \\"What'll It Take\\" as highlights of the album. A+E peaked at number thirty-nine on the UK Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for one week.

Originating from a single cumulonimbus cloud on July 9, Gordon developed into a tropical depression near the Northern Mariana Islands and quickly intensified as it tracked west- southwestward. On July 13, the storm attained typhoon status and subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification. By July 15, the storm attained its peak strength as a Category 5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260 km/h (160 mph). After striking the northern Philippines, Gordon moved through the South China Sea and slowly weakened. On July 18, the storm made landfall in southern China and was last noted the following day as it dissipated over land. Throughout Gordon's path from the Philippines to China, the storm caused widespread damage and loss of life. Across the Philippines, 90 people were killed by the typhoon and an estimated 120,000 people were left homeless. Though a weaker storm when it struck China, damage was more severe due to extensive flooding. Several coastal cities were completely inundated. Throughout the country, at least 200 people died and losses reached 1.2 billion yuan ($319 million USD). Additionally, 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in Hong Kong. Meteorological history In early July, widespread showers and thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough (TUTT). On July 9, a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became associated with the TUTT and quickly organized. By July 11, the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W. Upon classification, the system was located roughly 320 km (200 mi) east of the Northern Mariana Islands. The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways: first, a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone; and second, it became tropical while situated underneath a cold-core low. Following the system's classification as a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained a west- southwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north. On July 12, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goring. During the afternoon of July 13, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day. As the TUTT gradually warmed, Gordon was able to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July 14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70 mbar (hPa; 2.07 inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. At the end of this phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category 5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260 km/h (160 mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915 mbar (hPa; 27.02 inHg). Once classified a super typhoon, Gordon acquired a slight northerly component to its track and maintained a general west- northwestward trajectory for the remainder of its existence. Late on July 15, Gordon made landfall in northern Luzon, Philippines, at peak intensity. Remaining over land for several hours, the storm quickly weakened before entering the South China Sea. The system maintained minimal typhoon status as it developed a large, ragged eye by July 17\\\\. Slight weakening took place hours before Gordon made landfall as a strong tropical storm near Zhanjiang in Southern China on July 18\\\\. Briefly moving over the warm, shallow waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, Gordon's convective structure tripled in size; however, the system continued to weaken. Later that day, the storm made its final landfall in southern Guangxi Province. Once onshore, Gordon quickly weakened and was last noted on July 19 by the JMA over southern Guangxi. Preparations and impact Philippines Across Luzon, air traffic was temporarily suspended on July 16 until the typhoon's passage. Storm signal three, the highest level of warning, was issued for five provinces while lesser warnings were in place for most of the northern Philippines. The Philippine Coast Guard ordered all vessels in Luzon to remain at port until the storm's passage. Residents along the coast were urged to take \\"extreme precaution.\\" (accessed through LexisNexis) All activities at the United States' Clark Air Base were canceled on July 16 while emergency rescue and cleanup teams were placed on standby.

It takes its name after the custom house or toldbod which used to be located in the area. Most of the historic buildings in the area were torn down in 1973 when the site was redeveloped but its central waterfront space has remained intact and features a number of structures which bear testament to its former use. Among the modern buildings in the area are the headquarters of M√¶rsk and the Danish Energy Agency. The area is adjacent to Churchill and Langelinie Parks. History The Custom House King Christian VI's Custom House in 1754 In Copenhagen, customs duties have been collected from ships since the 13th century. In 1617, the Royal Anchor Forge came into use as a custom house but when the king's grand plans for St. Ann's Rotunda, a monumental naval development, were abandoned and it was decided to convert the Anchor Forge to a naval church in its place, now the Church of Holmen, the custom house was moved to the other side of the harbour where it found a temporary home in a 10-bay building at Christianshavn. In 1628, it was moved back across the harbour where a new custom house had been constructed on a filled site north of the city. The entrance to the harbour was blocked with a barrier at night which marked the boundary between the northern and southern custom house areas. Thorvaldsen's arrival at the Custom House quay King Christian VI ordered the construction of a new custom house which was completed on the same site in 1734 to a Baroque design by Johan Cornelius Krieger. Royal Reception Quay The quay at Nordre Toldbod also served as the place where foreign monarchs and other peers were received when they arrived at Copenhagen by ship. It was also the place where the sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen was received, with great festivity, on 17 September 1838, when he returned home after four decades in Rome. Late 19th-century change Dahlerup's building for the Port Authority (1868) seen before Christian VI's custom house (left) was demolished The last decades of the 19th century brought change to the area. A new building for the Port Authority was built in 1868 to a design by Vilhelm Dahlerup and Frederik B√∏ttger, and a new custom house designed by Vilhelm Petersen was built a little further south between 1872 and 1875. The new Free Port was inaugurated just north of Kastellet in 1884. Christian VI's custom house at the boundary between S√∏ndre and Nordre Toldbod was torn down in 1891 to make way for a new warehouse for goods in transit, the Frilagerbygningen building. Recent history Nordre Toldbod In 1973 the majority of the buildings in the area were torn down. Most of the land was sold to A. P. M√∏ller-M√¶rsk which built a new head office designed by Ole Hagen on the corner of Nordre Toldbod and Esplanaden between 1974 and 1979. To the south of that, a new building for the Customs Department (Danish: Toldv√¶senet) was constructed to a design by Niels and Eva Koppel. The latter has later been taken over by the Danish Energy Agency. Buildings and features Dahlerup's Port Authority Building with the two Royal Pavilions Port Authority Building Vilhelm Dahlerup's building from 1868 for the Port Authority marks the western boundary of the quayside space at Nordre Toldbod. The design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture and the building originally consisted of two stories with a small one-story appendix topped by a balustrade on each side. The original building was extended with an extra floor by Einar Madvig and now consists of a three-story main building with two low lateral wings in 1939, and a rear wing was added in 1901. The building is now the head office of By & Havn. The old main entrance with the guardhouses Main entrance Located just south of the Port Authority Building, the former main entrance to the Nordre Toldbod area is a gate with gate pillars topped by lions. Just inside the gate, the access road passes between two long one-story buildings with 8-arch arcades facing the traffic. They were designed by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch and built in 1856. Langelinie Gate and rough iron grill The old Freeport gate The north side of the Port Authority's building connects to a rough iron fence which defines the northern boundary of the space. It is the only surviving section of the fence that used to surround the Freeport. The fence opens through a gate toward Langelinie. The gate pillars double as guardhouses and they are topped by two zinc statues depicting Neptune and Mercury. Royal pavilions The two small pavilions on the quay in front of the Port Authority Building were built in 1905. It remains unclear who designed them but they are attributed to Osvald Rosendahl Langballe. They are today used when the Royal Family crosses the harbour to board HDMY Dannebrog, the Royal Yacht, which is docked at Holmen. One of Dahlerup's Dragon street lights Dragon street lights The place where the royal challup lands is also flanked by two street lights topped by dragon figures which hold the fixtures. One of the dragons has red eyes. They were designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup and installed in 1892. In connection with their design of a master plan for the nearby Amerika Plads area, the architectural practice West 8 created a special street light for the new neighbourhood which is a Cubist reinterpretation of Dahlerup's dragon lights at Nordre Toldbod. Gefion Fountain St. Alban's English Church in neighbouring Churchill Park as a backdrop The Gefion Fountain is located immediately outside the Langelinie Gate and portrays the legendary Norse goddess Gefjun driving a group of oxen, a reference to a legend about the creation of Zealand. Gefion Bridge The Gefion Fountain is situated next to the Gefion Bridge, a foot bridge which provides access to Langelinie along an elevated promenade. Designed by Asger Ostenfeld and completed in 1894, it originally spanned the Free Port rail line which connected the Free Port to the custom house, but now appears in a new context after the restoration of Kastellet.

The board is 7√ó7 squares, or alternatively a 61-cell hexagon with two additional pawns per side. The game is an offshoot and simplification of a Freeling game named Loonybird (or Dragon Chess). Still, \\"Play is complex and interesting. Draws are rare too.\\" Game rules The standard rules of chess apply, including winning by checkmate. But Dragonfly follows these special rules: * A bishop, knight, or rook that is captured, enters the capturing player's pieces in hand in his own color. As a move, a player may drop any one of the pieces he has in hand on any open square (if the move is otherwise legal). Captured pawns do not go in hand and are instead removed from the game. * Pawns do not have an initial double-step option. (So, en passant is not possible.) A pawn promotes when reaching the furthest to any piece of the player's choosing from those currently held in hand by his opponent. (If the opponent has none, then a pawn move to the furthest rank may not be made.) The chosen piece is removed from the opponent's in-hand stock. * Castling is permitted, and normal castling conventions apply, with the king shifting over two squares in either direction. But castling with a dropped rook is not allowed. Dragonfly hex Dragonfly hex starting setup Dragonfly on the hex board is played the same as Dragonfly 7√ó7, except that pieces move and capture as in Gli≈Ñski's hexagonal chess (with the exceptions that pawns have no initial double-step option, and castling is permitted).

Ayala served as the first elected Mayor of Chino, California from 1964 to 1966, and a California State Senator for twenty-four years from 1974 to 1998. Biography Early life Ayala was born on March 6, 1922, in Chino, California, as one of six siblings. His grandparents were immigrants from Mexico. His mother died at an early age and his father supported the six children as a well digger. Ayala helped his father by working in the beet farms surrounding Chino and as a shoe shiner. He attended segregated elementary schools in Chino. Segregation also prevented the family from moving to or purchasing property in predominantly Non-Hispanic white neighborhoods in Chino. Ayala graduated from Chino High School. He then enrolled at Pomona Junior College, which is now called Mt. San Antonio College. Ayala served in the United States Marines in the Pacific Theater during World War II from 1941 to 1946. He returned to Chino after the war and graduated from the National Electronic Institute in Los Angeles. He initially worked as a television repairman for the Admiral Television Company. He also held a position as a sales manager for the Homelight Corporation, which sold construction materials. He married his wife, Irene, and had three sons. He joined the local Chino Parent-Teacher Association, which began an interest in politics. Local political career In 1955, Ayala was elected to the school board for the Chino school district. He served on the Chino School Board from 1955 to 1962. Ayala then turned his attention to citywide politics. He was elected to the Chino City Council, serving in the council from 1962 to 1964. Ayala became the first elected Mayor of Chino, California, in 1964, holding that office until 1966. He was elected to the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors in 1965, serving in that county-wide office from 1966 until 1973, including four years as the board's chairman. Statewide politics Ayala challenged former Democratic U.S. Rep. George Brown, Jr. in a 1972 primary election for a newly redrawn U.S. House seat. Brown defeated Ayala in the primary, marking the only election loss in Ayala's political career. In 1974, Ayala defeated California Assemblyman Jerry Lewis, a Republican from San Bernardino County and future U.S. congressman, in a special election for an open California State Senate seat. His new Senate district represented the San Bernardino County cities of Chino, Colton, Fontana, Ontario and Rialto, as well as Pomona, California, in neighboring Los Angeles County. Upon his 1974 election, Ayala became the first person of Mexican American descent elected to the California State Senate since 1911. Ayala became known as a maverick in the Senate, willing to support or oppose bills from both his fellow Democrats and the Republicans. He co-authored a bill which created the California Conservation Corps, which enlists young people to work in environmental conservation. The legislation to create the Corps was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in 1976. Ayala later became the chairman of the Senate Agriculture and Water Resources Committee, which increased his influence on California's water policy. Ayala supported a proposal for the Peripheral Canal, which would have diverted water from northern California to the central and southern portions of the state. The canal proposal was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, but opposed by environmental organizations. The canal was roundly defeated by voters in 1982, with 62% opposition, including a plurality of voters in Northern California. Ayala's other political viewpoints sometimes proved controversial as well. A political centrist, he was viewed as more conservative than most of the State Senate's Democrats, but more liberal than most of the body's Republicans. He refused to join the Senate's Latino caucus, telling the Riverside Press-Enterprise, \\"I'm of Mexican descent and I'm proud of it, but I don't wear it on my sleeve ... I don't want to be segregated.\\" His refusal to join the caucus drew criticism from some Latino activists. Ayala blocked the appointment of actress Jane Fonda to the California Arts Council. He supported gun control, opposed abortion and supported organized labor. Most of Ayala's re-election campaigns were relatively noncompetitive. However, Ayala won his most competitive re-election campaign in 1990. That year, he was challenged for his seat by Republican assemblyman Charles W. Bader. Ayala raised more than one million dollars during his 1990 re-election campaign. In 1990, California voters approved term limits for California state senators and assemblymen. Ayala left office in 1998 as the term limits took effect. Later life A park in Bloomington, California, and a street in Rialto, California, have been named for Ayala. A high school in Chino Hills within the Chino Valley Unified School District was established in his honor in 1990 and is called the Ruben S. Ayala High School. Ruben Ayala died at the Inland Christian Home in Ontario, California, on January 4, 2012, at the age of 89. He was survived by his three sons: Ruben Jr. (\\"Bud\\"), Maurice and Gary; three grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. He was inducted into the Chino Hall of Fame on January 17, 2012.

The CCM follows the Salyut and Almaz series, Cosmos 557, Skylab, Mir, ISS, Tiangong 1 and Tiangong 2 space stations. It is the first part of a third generation modular space station. Other examples of modular station projects include the Soviet/Russian Mir, Russian OPSEK, and the International Space Station. Operations will be controlled from the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center in the People's Republic of China. In 2018 fullscale mockup of CCM was publicly presented at China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition in Zhuhai. In October 2020, China selected 18 new astronauts ahead of space station construction to participate in the country‚Äôs upcoming space station project. Functions and systems The Core Module provides life support and living quarters for three crew members, and provides guidance, navigation, and orientation control for the station. The module also provides the station's power, propulsion, and life support systems. The module consists of three sections: the habitable living quarter, the nonhabitable service section, and a docking hub. The living quarters will contain a kitchen and toilet, fire control equipment, atmospheric processing and control equipment, computers, scientific apparatus, communications equipment to see and hear ground control in Beijing, and other equipment. It will also have a small robotic arm, similar to the MIR Lyappa arm, to move the modules to different ports. Electrical power is provided by two steerable solar power arrays, which use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity. Energy is stored to power the station when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Resupply ships will replenish fuel for the module's propulsion engines for station-keeping, to counter the effects of atmospheric drag. Structure Panel views of the Chinese Tianhe Space Station core module China has established \\"a good working relationship\\" with space agencies in Russia, France, Germany and other countries. With a long history of technology transfer with Russia, Chinese space assets are compatible with Russian orbital hardware. The MARS-500 collaborative study between China, Russia and Europe prepares for a deep space manned mission to Mars. The forward docking hub allows the core module to be docked with four other space station visiting craft, including two experimental modules, a cargo ship Tianzhou spacecraft, and a Shenzhou spacecraft. The axial and nadir port of the module will be fitted with rendezvous equipment. A mechanical arm similar to the Russian Lyappa arm used on the Mir space station will be fitted to each of the future experiment modules. The axial port on the docking hub will be the primary docking port. When new modules arrive, they will first dock here, then the mechanical arm shall attach and move the module to a radial port. Crew and supply ships from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center will dock to either of the axial ports of the module, as well as the nadir (lower) port. The zenith (Space facing) port has been modified to act as the stations EVA hatch, as the spherical docking hub is also the EVA airlock. The first space station, Salyut 1, and other one- piece or 'monolithic' first generation space stations, such as Salyut 2,3,4,5, DOS 2, Kosmos 557, Almaz and NASA's Skylab stations, were not designed for re- supply. Generally, each crew had to depart the station to free the only docking port for the next crew to arrive. Skylab had more than one docking port but was not designed for resupply. Salyut 6 and 7 had more than one docking port and were designed to be resupplied routinely during crewed operation. Modular stations can allow the mission to be changed over time, and new modules can be added or removed from the existing structure, allowing greater flexibility. The CCM is designed for replenishment of consumables and has a service life of at least 10 years. The length of the module is 18.1m. It is cylindrical with a maximum diameter of 4.2m and an on orbit mass between 20 and 22 thousand kilograms. Launch It is expected to launch in 2021 on a Long March 5B from Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, into a Low Earth Orbit 340 to 450 km above the Earth at an orbital inclination of 42 to 43 degrees.

Operations will be controlled from the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center in the People's Republic of China. Purpose The first laboratory module will provide additional navigation avionics, propulsion and orientation control as backup functions for the Core Cabin Module (CCM). Both LCMs provide a pressurized environment for researchers to conduct science experiments in freefall or zero gravity which could not be conducted on Earth for more than a few minutes. Experiments can also be placed on the outside of the modules, for exposure to the space environment, cosmic rays, vacuum, and solar winds.

Zoellick, his first high-level appointment after taking over the presidency in July that year. Anstey also served as World Bank Sherpa to the G20. During her previous role as the World Bank's country director for the Caribbean, Anstey was successful in raising funds for Haiti's reconstruction as donors prepared to re-engage in 2004 after former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide went into exile. She also played a key role, as acknowledged by regional leaders, in the setting up of an innovative regional disaster insurance scheme for Caribbean states, to give governments immediate access to funds after hurricanes and earthquakes. In July 2013, the World Bank's President, Jim Yong Kim, announced that, as part of a larger management reshuffle, Anstey would leave the Bank's employment following the Annual Meetings in the Fall of the year. Biography Anstey was born in London, England on 7 November 1955. She is the daughter of Edgar Anstey, a pioneer of British documentary film and Hollywood Oscar winner, and Daphne Lilly, a Film Editor at the National Film Board of Canada. Anstey was Head Girl at Henrietta Barnett School, London and went on to receive a First Class Honours Degree in International History and Politics from Leeds University; a scholarship to pursue Graduate studies in Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley; and a PhD on British Foreign Office Efforts to Influence American Opinion, 1945‚Äì49 from the London School of Economics. She was awarded a Gwilym Gibbon Prize Research Fellowship from Nuffield College, Oxford. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Anstey authored and co-authored a number of works (see Publications). She worked as Political Assistant to James Callaghan, British Prime Minister between 1974 and 1979, and as Editor of the BBC's Flagship weekly current affairs program, Analysis. While Editor of Analysis, Anstey collaborated with Peter Hennessy, a regular presenter of Analysis on BBC Radio 4 from 1987 to 1992, on a series of Analysis Papers based on interviews aired on the program (see Publications). She also served as Secretariat member of the InterAction Council, a group of former Heads of Government, chaired by Helmut Schmidt, that develops recommendations on political, economic, and social issues. Anstey joined the World Bank in 1995 as a consultant in the Bank's External Affairs department, and the following year was appointed as assistant and speechwriter to the then World Bank President James Wolfensohn, later crediting him with giving the institution a ‚Äúheart and soul‚Äù. Anstey also worked as director of media and World Bank chief spokesperson, prior to moving to the position of country director for the Caribbean, then chief of staff to the president, and then vice president for external affairs where she drove a triple agenda of results, accountability and openness. Anstey's appointment as managing director came after the departure of former Managing Director, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to take up a position as co-ordinating minister for the economy and minister of finance in Nigeria. As managing director, Anstey had a broad portfolio with responsibility for World Bank operational services, policy and systems ‚Äì an arrangement which also included the Bank's External Affairs division, human resources and the Bank's information management group, as well as responsibility for gender issues. After taking over the role, Anstey said the Bank's push for modernization, openness and accountability meant people could \\"hold our feet to the fire‚Äù. She also advocated for innovative ways to ensure knowledge reaches citizens, not just experts.

Geyser became an outcast in the white Afrikaner community because of his theological opposition to apartheid and to the Broederbond, the secret male Calvinist organisation that covertly steered South African politics during the apartheid era. He obtained master's and doctoral degrees cum laude, specializing in Greek and Latin. At the age of 27 he was appointed lecturer, and a year later, professor in the Theological Faculty of the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk at the University of Pretoria. Geyser contributed to the first annotated edition (1953‚Äì1958) of the Bible in Afrikaans, founded the Christian Institute, and was the first South African to be elected as a member of Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas. Family background and early life Albert Geyser was born to Maria Johanna Albertina (\\"Nina\\") Lamprecht and Petrus Geyser on 10 February 1918 on a farm near Naboomspruit, Transvaal province (now the town of Mookgophong in the Limpopo Province). Petrus and Maria had three children, including Albert's brother, Hendrik Johannes Geyser. The Geyser progenitor had immigrated to South Africa in 1725, and Albert's great-grandfather and grandfather had been among the founding members of the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk (NHK). Albert Geyser, 1930s Albert Geyser attended primary school in Ermelo, and matriculated from the Ho√´rskool (High School) ErmeloBy contrast, Van Aarde (1992:160) states that Geyser \\"matriculated at Pretoria\\". in 1935. With his brother, Hendrik, he was admitted to the University of Pretoria, with both intending to become ministers in the NHK. Albert earned his BA degree in Greek and Latin cum laude in 1938, followed by a BD in 1940. As denominational regulations required a minimum age of 23 years for appointment as a minister, Geyser worked in Cape Town until he became eligible in 1941. He was then invited to serve the congregations at Heilbron and at Parys in the Free State, where he was ordained and ministered from 1941 to 1943. In the early 1940s Geyser married Celia van der Westhuisen in Rustenburg and the couple had three sons and two daughters. Geyser continued his studies at Pretoria and earned an MA in Greek and Latin in 1943.According to Van Aarde (1992), Geyser gained his MA in 1943, while Oberholzer (2010) lists both 1942 and 1943. He served as minister of the NHK's Pretoria North-West congregation from 1944‚Äì1945.According to Dreyer (2015), Geyser's ministry at Pretoria-Northwest lasted until 1946. He completed additional courses in Aramaic and Syriac in 1945, adding these to his sound knowledge of Afrikaans, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, German, Dutch and English; meaning that he could \\"read 10 languages.\\" He earned a Doctor Divinitatis degree with distinction in 1946 on the topic of the genealogy of Jesus, also at the University of Pretoria. Geyser's was the first doctorate to be awarded by the Theology Faculty.  Academic career  Geyser's academic career included professorial appointments at the University of Pretoria (1946-1961) and, subsequently, at the University of the Witwatersrand (1962-1983). The Old Arts Building at the University of Pretoria where Geyser lectured. The Theology Faculty was housed in this building until 1980. In August 1944 Geyser was nominated by the Theology Faculty as professor of New Testament Exegesis and successor to Professor J H J A Greyvenstein in the NHK's section at the University of Pretoria. Greyvenstein had reached retirement age in 1943, but the Faculty had permitted him to continue teaching until Geyser had obtained his doctorate. Geyser had registered in 1943 for a doctorate in Church History, but in September 1944 switched to New Testament studies with Professor Berend Gemser as doctoral advisor. Geyser's appointment as professor produced controversies from the outset, relating to other faculty members, his lack of a doctorate, the selection of a rector for the University and, later, his theological interpretations and political views. His appointment had been subject to the completion of his doctorate. Since 1944 Greyvenstein had wanted his successor to be either his student, S P J J van Rensburg, or the Dutch doctor Adrianus van Selms, lecturer in Semitic languages and Old Testament Studies in the Faculty since 1938. But by 1945 Van Rensburg lacked a doctorate, and although Van Rensburg had been given similar conditions to Geyser's, he fell out of contention as he took much longerVan Rensburg completed his dissertation only in 1958, with Geyser as his promoter, receiving final confirmation that he had obtained it cum laude in January 1959 (Oberholzer 2010). than Geyser to complete his doctoral examinations. Van Selms was a prisoner of war in Japanese-held Indonesia, and would only return in 1946.Van Selms had a leave of absence from the Faculty to serve as a lieutenant in the Royal Dutch Army during World War Two. Interned by the Japanese in the former Dutch colony of Indonesia from March 1942 to March 1945, he only resumed his duties in the Faculty in May 1946. At the May 1945 general assembly of the NHK Greyvenstein requested to continue teaching beyond 1947 and mobilized some of his former students in support. Greyvenstein was particularly reluctant to surrender two of his three courses to Geyser, one of which he had handed off to C H Rautenbach in 1939. Another group solidified around Professor S P Engelbrecht in support of Geyser, who would have been left with only one course to teach if Greyvenstein had been allowed to continue. The NHK's General Assembly rejected Greyvenstein's position by a vote of 70 to 55, revealing that Geyser's ascension was far from unanimous. Disputes about Geyser's appointment continued through various official meetings until September 1946, when Greyvenstein abruptly retired, rendering it moot. With regards Geyser's academic qualifications, a Professor H P Wolmarans was concerned that Geyser's studies neglected theology in favour of classical languages. While Geyser completed the oral and written examinations well in August 1945, his examiners were divided about the quality of his doctoral dissertation. Only one of his three examiners, Professor J. De Zwaan of the University of Leiden, recommended that the degree should be granted cum laude, but this was the option endorsed by the council of the Faculty of Theology in March 1946. After an initial appointment in 1946, Geyser was permanently appointed in September 1947Dreyer notes 1946 as the date of Geyser's appointment as professor. as professor and head of the Department of New Testament Science. Geyser insisted on taking all of Greyvenstein's subjects, including practical theology, Christian ethics, and dogmatics, forbidding students from attending Rautenbach's ethics class. Rautenbach aired his displeasure at Geyser's actions in various meetings. According to Adriaan Pont, former undergraduate of Geyser's and later his fiercest adversary, Rautenbach had opposed Geyser's appointment. By 1948 Geyser, along with Gemser, was involved in the administration and maintenance of the official scholarly journal of the Faculty, Hervormde Teologiese Studies/Reformed Theological Studies. Meanwhile, Rautenbach was confirmed as rector of the University in March 1948. Geyser's position at the University of Pretoria afforded him the opportunity to study in Europe and to broaden his perspectives. The Rijksuniversiteit of Utrecht invited Geyser to Senate House at the University of the Witwatersrand, where Geyser's office and the Department of Religious Studies were located on the northeast corner.lecture in New Testament studies for six months in 1951. Recognition of his academic stature is revealed by his election in 1951 as one of five international members on the Utrecht Theological Society's committee. He served on the editorial boards of Novum Testamentum and of Supplements to Novum Testamentum. He worked for six months in 1959 at the Facult√© de Libre du Protenstantisme at the Sorbonne on the concept of \\"The Church in the New Testament\\". In 1959 he was invited to the Papal Institute in Rome to visit the excavations under St. Peter's Basilica. As a result of disputes raised by colleagues such as Pont, and some of Geyser's students about his political views and theological interpretations, Geyser was forced to resign from the University of Pretoria in 1961. Rautenbach was instrumental in dismissing Geyser. In 1964 Geyser became the first professor and head of the Department of Divinity (later renamed the Department of Religious Studies) at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.  Theological rejection of apartheid  Geyser's first years at the University of Pretoria (i.e. 1946-1952) continued his support for the racial policies of the South Africa government and of his denomination that was evident during his ministry. Writing about the evolution of Geyser's thinking, Pieter de Villiers comments that \\"Geyser‚Äôs support of apartheid [at this time] is not surprising, since a racist lifestyle was firmly embedded in South African social life and accepted as self-evident.\\" The NHK's missionary policy proceeded from the position that as only whites could be members of the denomination, missionary work should aim to establish separate churches for each people group (\\"nation\\"). The NHK would be such a volkskerk, providing an exclusive ecclesiastical home for white Afrikaners while adhering to \\" 'conservative Christian-national values'\\", as the Commission of the NHK's General Church Assembly noted in June 1967. Geyser's personal political affiliation during this period is unclear. His lifelong adversary, Pont, accused Geyser of having then been aligned with the United Party. The United Party, led by former field marshal Jan Smuts, was for co- operation with Britain, while at home it stood for an informal segregation, opposed geographic separation and, by the 1960s, wanted a single citizenship for all South Africans. By contrast, the National Party came to power in 1948 on the basis of a rejection of co-operation with Britain and proposals to implement apartheid formally. J P Oberholzer argues that by 1956 Geyser was a member of the Suid-Afrikaanse BondThe Suid-Afrikaanse Bond drew only 0.1% of the total vote in South Africa and South-West Africa in the 1958 general election, according to Groenewald (2013). and the Suid-Afrika Eerste Beweging, without providing further explanation. Pont himself helped to form the Herstigte Nasionale Party in 1969, and unsuccessfully stood for the HNP in the 1970 city council election in Waterkloof, Pretoria. Geyser's actions and writing after 1952 suggests that two factors in post-Second World War Europe may have contributed to his abandonment of race-based nationalism and his lifelong commitment to ecumenism. German churches were having to deal with their support for an ethnic nationalism and with the subsequent genocide of Jews that followed. And in response to a rising need for ecumenism, the World Council of Churches (WCC) was established in 1948 in Amsterdam. During his European stay Geyser was increasingly influenced by progressive ecumenists who had emerged in the Netherlands and elsewhere. Following his return from Europe, Geyser became increasingly critical of the use of theology as a basis for apartheid. In reaction to a government proposal which in effect would forbid blacks from attending churches in white areas, Geyser warned in a July 1957 letter to Die Vaderland newspaper that \\"The church must seriously reconsider whether it will allow the re-erection of barriers that have been broken down by Christ.\\" Portions of Geyser's letter were republished in The Star of 24 July 1957. Geyser's Pretoria colleague Ben Marais had made similar statements during the annual Peter Ainslie Memorial Lecture at Rhodes University on 10 September 1957. In 1955 Geyser joined 13 Afrikaans academics in signing a petition that condemned the National Party government's proposed removal of coloureds from Parliament and the stacking of the Senate with its own politicians to better achieve its aims. As the publication of the petition coincided with the launch of public protests by the official opposition party, Geyser was accused of transgressing the NHK's prohibition that clergy refrain from partisan actions or pronouncements. Geyser's signing of the petition marked a turning point in his relations with those inside and outside the NHK, which worsened as he set out to refute any biblical justifications for apartheid. The NHK initially tolerated his views, permitting him an extensive hearing in the theological journal, Hervormde Teologiese Studies in 1960. Here he launched a scathing attack on the theological justification of apartheid advocated in the book \\"Eiesoortige Ontwikkeling tot Volksdiens,\\" written by Professor A. B. du Preez, then Professor of Dogmatics in the Faculty of Theology (Section B) at the University of Pretoria. While Geyser by 1960 still identified with those who called themselves Afrikaner \\"nationalists,\\" he clearly meant the desire for political self-determination, not the more narrowly-defined racist ideology intent on developing one group at the expense of others.White Afrikaner nationalism arose partly in response to the Anglicisation policies under British rule, and included attempts to establish Afrikaans alongside English. Academics like Geyser and Keet could join in attempts to raise the status of Afrikaans, for instance by helping to translate the Bible, while still rejecting the racial aspects of Afrikaner nationalist ideology (see Dreyer 2017). This distinction emerges clearly in a 1969 essay in Pro Veritate in which he pointed out that the Protestant reformer Calvin was not a nationalist. Geyser was responding to claims by the conservative politicians Andries Treurnicht and Albert Hertzog that Afrikaner nationalism, which rejects \\"English\\" liberalism, derives from Calvin's teachings. In the context of the Sharpeville massacre in 1960 Geyser used public media more intensively to castigate the government for its unjust draconian laws. He joined a group of 350 Afrikaans clergy who met secretly in Johannesburg and Pretoria for six months to discuss the nature and effects of apartheid policies on churches. As a direct result of these consultations, a book titled Vertraagde Reaksie (Delayed Action) was produced, comprising contributions by 11 authors,Contributors affiliated with the NHK included Geyser, Van Selms, M. J. Redelinghuys, and J. Stutterheim; the DRC was represented by Keet, Ben Marais, G. C. Oosthuizen, J.A. van Wyk, and G.J. Swart; those from Reformed Churches (GKSA) included H. du Plessis and C. Hattingh (Dreyer 2015). edited by Geyser and Stellenbosch theologican B B Keet. Constituting \\"the first formal protest of Afrikaans theologians against apartheid,\\" the book aimed to help churches express their public witness and Christian calling in a context marked by the increasing miseries caused by apartheid legislation. Geyser and Marais clarified in an interview with Die Transvaler newspaper on 21 November 1960 that \\"the book was not written for politicians or to promote rebellion in church and state. It was not intended as a political pamphlet, but rather as a theological document with political consequences.\\" The Broederbond led a smear campaign against Geyser and the other authors. Geyser was painted as an enemy of Afrikaners by journalists, church leaders, and members of the public, and received death threats. At a public meeting in Brits in January 1961, attended by about 3,000 people, the contributors to Vertraagde Reaksie were denounced as conspiring with the ecumenical movement to bring about the demise of Afrikaner people. Geyser's colleague from the Theology Faculty, Pont, told participants that the authors were \\" 'demanding the suicide of the white people in South Africa'.\\" The effect of such attacks by colleagues and the media was to isolate Geyser completely. Invitations to preach or to participate in church events decreased dramatically, denying Geyser opportunities to present his views to others. Relation to the Cottesloe Consultation Geyser received international support for his views when, following the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, the World Council of Churches sent a delegation to meet with clerics in the Johannesburg suburb of Cottesloe. The Cottesloe Consultation resulted in 17 recommendations, three of which caused great commotion in the Afrikaans media: * The church must not discriminate on the basis of skin colour or race. * There are no biblical grounds for a ban on mixed marriages. * The possession of land and participation in government are inalienable human rights. The recommendations were rejected outright by the Broederbond, the leading National Party and Prime Minister Verwoerd, who claimed foreign powers were interfering with South Africa's domestic policies. As a result of this conflict the NHK and the Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (NGK) withdrew from the WCC. While Geyser was not a representative at Cottesloe he strongly supported the recommendations and continued to launch fierce attacks on the NHK, particularly on its understanding of the concept of catholicity and on its policy with regard to missionary work. Following the Cottesloe Consultation Geyser became an opponent of Article III of the NHK constitution, which specifically forbids blacks as members. It was inevitable that he would clash with what he saw as the \\"ideological theology\\" of his own and other Afrikaans churches. This made his position as a Professor in the Faculty of Theology of the Church untenable, both for the Church and for himself. Accusations of heresy In January 1961 two mass protests against the authors of Delayed Action, attended by thousands of Afrikaners, were organised by Pont, then professor of church history in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria. In September 1961 the Broederbond-controlled leadership of the NHK responded to complaints by three students and accused Geyser of heresy and insubordination because of his interpretation of Philippians 2:5‚Äì11. The written charges against him comprised 13 pages, accusing him of saying that God's love (agape) knew no racial boundaries; of breaking regulations that prohibited criticism of NHK decisions; denying that apartheid had any Biblical basis; and attempting to organize a meeting between his students and Catholic seminarians. He was asked to resign his professorship of New Testament Studies because the chair was sponsored by the NHK. While he was acquitted on the charges of insubordination, he was found guilty of heresy by the Synodal Commission of the NHK and expelled in May 1962. It was widely accepted that the NHK used the accusation of heresy in an attempt to remove Geyser because of his opposition to Article III of the NHK constitution and his \\"deviant\\" views on racial matters. Geyser felt he was falsely accused and contested the Commission's findings in the Supreme Court. During the subsequent court case the NHK reached an out of court settlement and he was reinstated. However these conflicts continued to be a source of tension and Geyser resigned as minister of the NHK in 1963. Geyser left the University of Pretoria in 1962 after successfully applying for the position as the first professor and Head of the Department of Divinity (now the Department of Religious Studies) at the University of the Witwatersrand. Founding of The Christian Institute of South Africa During the early 1960s Geyser befriended Beyers Naud√© and disclosed to him his idea of establishing a movement which would bring together ecumenically minded Christians in Southern Africa with a view to a united witness against the ideology of apartheid and its negative consequences in church and society. The Christian Institute of Southern Africa was formed in 1963, and Geyser as the chairman of the board of directors had little difficulty in persuading Naud√©, then a minister of the NGK, to become its first director. For some years the friendship between Naud√© and Geyser endured the direction in which Naud√© steered the Christian Institute. But according to one biographer of Geyser's, when Naud√© joined Desmond Tutu in agitating for international action against South Africa, this alienated Geyser both from Naud√© and from the Christian Institute. Naud√© and the Christian Institute were subsequently banned by the National Party Government in 1977. For Geyser the failure of the Christian Institute was one of the greatest disappointments of his life. Unmasking Broederbond members Naud√© asked Geyser for his advice because the anti-apartheid stance of the Christian Institute was increasingly at odds with his membership of the Broederbond. To help Geyser understand the tensions between these two loyalties Naud√© provided Geyser with a number of secret Broederbond documents which included minutes of meetings and the names of members of the Broederbond. Unknown to Naud√©, Geyser (who was a keen amateur photographer) made photostats of the documents before returning them. Geyser's advice was crucial in Naud√©'s subsequent decision to resign from the Broederbond. In November 1963 the English newspaper, The Sunday Times published the Broederbond documents and Naud√© was initially blamed for the leak. In reality it was Geyser who had leaked the documents to a journalist at the newspaper. In his statement on 20 November 1963, Geyser said that he had decided to make the documents public because he wanted to frustrate the aims of the Broederbond. According to Geyser the documents showed without a doubt that the Broederbond was using the Church for political ends: \\"My immediate observation was that these people were making the Church, which is the bride of Christ, a servant girl of politics\\". The Broederbond reported the documents stolen and the offices of Naud√© and Geyser were raided by the security police. The fact that the raids were not conducted through normal police operations but by the security police implied that the actions of the leaders of the Christian Institute were now regarded as a matter of national security. The Christian Institute continued to be a target for security police raids and attacks in the Afrikaans media. Court cases against defamation During 1964 and 1965 Pont wrote a series of articles in Die Hervormer, the monthly magazine of the NHK in which he accused Naud√© and Geyser of various misdemeanours, including: * Supporting and promoting communism and its objectives * Advocating sabotage and planning a revolution * Pretending to be Christians but in reality seeking to destroy Christianity * Supporting the massacre and murder of white women and children * Committing heresy and opposing the Afrikaner churches Pont also accused the Christian Institute of being a front for communist activities. Naud√© and Geyser sued Pont and the editor of Die Hervormer for defamation (libel). The editor immediately acknowledged that the offending articles contained \\"crass, untrue and defamatory statements\\" and expressed his \\"deep and sincere regret\\", but Pont refused to retract his comments. The case was determined in Naud√© and Geyser's favour in February 1967 and Pont was ordered to pay Naud√© and Geyser R20,000 damages each and also pay their legal costs (R150,000). At the time it was the largest amount ever awarded in South Africa as damages for defamation. As the NHK never censored Pont but issued a letter supporting him to its congregations, Geyser asked for a meeting with NHK officials, where he called on them to repent, before telling them that he and his wife were leaving the denomination. Consequences of opposition and death Geyser retired from his professorship in 1983 after 20 years of academic work at the University of the Witwatersrand. He continued his public denouncements of apartheid through a number of writings and interviews despite the high price paid by his family, who were ostracised and physically threatened. Geyser himself survived an assassination attempt when the brakes on his car were reportedly tampered with. In an interview with the Sunday Express in January 1983 he warned that: \\"A Church in isolation is doomed to futility. It has no function and becomes a museum piece, because the very concept of a Church is that it should be universal\\". The last 20 years of his life he formally belonged to no church, but attended services in the Anglican, Presbyterian and Nederlands Hervormde (Dutch Congregation) churches. Geyser was hospitalised in 1985 following a minor heart attack. While recovering in hospital he penned a letter to President P. W. Botha urging him to atone for the role played by himself and the National Party in implementing apartheid after 1948. The letter, written in Afrikaans, was headed: \\"Consensus, conciliation, confidence, confession\\" and demonstrated that while Geyser was sympathetic to President Botha's reforms he continued to have theological reservations. In the letter Geyser states \\"I am sorry Mr President, even if you are now rowing back as hard as what the fear for the Conservative Party (CP) permits you, you are one of the oldest surviving people responsible. Do not regard it beneath you to accept and to confess guilt for your own share during your cabinet and Broederbond years‚Ä¶You can write off reform in South Africa as long as you allow this self- appointed self-propagating Afrikaner aristocracy to circumvent and undermine the democratic processes in South Africa\\". Commenting on the role of the Broederbond in drafting the policy on apartheid, he wrote: \\"It was easy for this dark 'think tank' to succeed with its mutual self-promotion in the civil service, government circles, education and church, because it sidestepped the restraining but healthy experimenting station of public debate\\". Geyser suffered a second, fatal heart attack before he was able to finish the letter, but the contents were published by The Sunday Star on 23 July 1985. Despite his estrangement from the NHK his last wish was for his funeral to be held at the Nederlands Hervormde (Dutch Congregation) church in Parktown, Johannesburg. The church granted him this final wish. Geyser was survived by his wife, three of his children and eight grandchildren.  Legacy  Contemporaneous appraisals that lauded Geyser's political involvement included that of Alan Paton, president of the Liberal Party (LP). Paton lauded Geyser (with Beyers Naud√©) in his opening address to the National Conference of the LP in July 1965 as \\"brave\\" for being willing \\"to suffer for what they believe to be right, and who can see that separate development is the great white myth\\". In 1988 the 64th issue of the Journal of Theology for Southern Africa was devoted to Geyser's memory, with contributions by former colleagues and students. Concerted efforts have recently been made to restore Geyser's largely forgotten contributions to the resistance against apartheid. Individual and co-authored scholarly articles by A G van Aarde e.a. (1992, 2014) and Van Eck (1995) positively assessed his roles in theology, church and society. Geyser's arguments against the theological justification of apartheid, like that of his colleague Adrianus van Selms at Pretoria, lay the groundwork that ultimately led to its complete rejection in 2010 by the NHK. Van Selms was, with Berend Gemser, one of the dissenters from the NHK's theological justification of apartheid. Geyser's theological interpretations which led to his successful court cases against the NHK and Pont affected the content and style of the NHK's theologians for at least two decades. The denomination's pronouncements, to counter Geyser's, became ever more explicitly aligned with apartheid. In a 2011 memorial lecture in Leeuwarden Casper Labuschagne highlighted that it was Geyser who had initiated the formation of the Christian Institute and had co-founded the ecumenical newspaper Pro Veritate with Ben Engelbrecht. Labushcagne had been dismissed from the University of Pretoria in 1967 for supporting Geyser, and subsequently emigrated to the Netherlands. In 2014 an annual memorial lecture in honour of Geyser was instituted by the Faculty of Theology at the University of Pretoria. The first such lecture was presented by James Loader, whom the Faculty denied an appointment due to his opposition to the NHK's racial viewpoints. Journalist Benjamin Pogrund described Geyser as demonstrating \\"awesome intellectual courage and emotional strength\\" through his willingness to re-examine and reject the religious ideology behind apartheid, regardless of the consequences. Sowetan columnist and political commentator Prince Mashele wrote: \\" 'True virtue is not when a man defends his own interests, but when he endangers his life in defence of others. This is precisely what Geyser did. It is time for us, black people, to wage a 'Geyser must rise' campaign to protect the legacy of a white man who proclaimed that blacks were human at a time when such a basic truth was heresy.' \\" Publications * (1943).

She always liked to play sports with her brother and three sisters, spending most of her time outdoors. In those days girls and women could not play on their school and college teams, so she played baseball with the boys on town teams until Shirley Jameson, one of the first players who signed with the league, put her name in for the final tryout at Wrigley Field.The Diamond Angle AAGPBL Interview ‚Äì Mabel HolleThe Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Holle made the final cuts and was assigned to the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them for more of the year before being relocated to the Kenosha Comets for a short period of time.

Nevertheless, she did not give up playing and signed a contract with the rival National Girls Baseball League of Chicago to play for the next two seasons. A graduated from MacMurray College in 1942, Holle started teaching physical education as a coach and athletic administrator in the Waukegan area schools for most of her 47-year professional career, retiring in 1990.

The band started as a garage band from 1982 to 1984 and moved into thrash metal in 1985. It has released three studio albums, Massacre (1989), Psychotic Redemption (2001) and Crematorium (2005) with various other releases like demos, EPs, and compilations. They are also known for using corpse paint in a thrash metal band, later imitated by others. History Beginnings Massakre logo. Yanko T√≥lic started his musical career forming a garage band in 1982 named Sepulcro. The band didn't find much success and T√≥lic changed it to Embri√≥n. He also developed his skills by studying guitar playing, with the Chilean scene dominated by rock bands like Tumulto, Sol y Medianoche and Congreso. Influenced by acts like Celtic Frost, Slayer and Hellhammer, he changed his genre to thrash metal and established the band Massakre in 1985, by recruiting Andr√©s Cabr√≠o Marchant from Necrosis. The band appeared in major events in Santiago and Valparaiso, where there was great support for this type of music, alongside groups like Pentagram, Belial, Tormentor and Vulcano. Career After completing a successful festival tour, the band released some demo tapes that became popular, the first being Pissing into the Mass Grave in 1986, followed the same year by Altazor and Beyond the Psychotic Redemption in 1988. The latter contains the song \\"Morbid Death\\" that became a metal anthem for followers. But with success came the inevitable charges against the whole movement with some bands abandoning their route. This also affected Massakre, but they continued undeterred. A great point of opposition to the band was it using corpse paint which brought in charges of Satanic rituals and animal sacrifice and being possessed by evil spirits. The band tried to stop these rumours, but the accusations continued. Massakre released its first studio album in 1989. Entitled Massacre, although being thrash metal, it contained symphonic touches, and a conceptual story that links all the songs. But it was with the release of the better-produced Psychotic Redemption in 2001. After the release of their third studio album Crematorium in 2005, with additional influence of speed metal rather than just thrash metal, things cooled down. But the band continued to release EPs and compilation albums and has witnessed a comeback with the band also appearing in metal festivals like The Metal Fest in 2012.Orgullo Nacional (Chile): Conoce a las bandas nacionales presentes en THE METAL FEST (in Spanish) Members Band members *Yanko T√≥lic ‚Äì vocals, rhythm guitar (1982‚Äìpresent) *Eduardo Vidal ‚Äì bass guitar (1986‚Äì2003, 2005‚Äìpresent) *Gabriel Head ‚Äì lead guitar (2004‚Äìpresent) *H√©ctor Melo ‚Äì drums, percussion (2010‚Äìpresent) Past members *Andres Nacrur ‚Äì drums (1985‚Äì1986, 1998) *Jose Miguel Nacrur ‚Äì guitar (1985‚Äì1986) *Mauricio Ya√±ez ‚Äì drums (1985) *Alfredo Torres ‚Äì guitar (1985) *Christian Miccolo ‚Äì bass (1985) *Claudio Mu√±oz ‚Äì drums (1986) *Marco Carre√±o ‚Äì drums (1987 to 1990) *Manuel Castro ‚Äì keyboards (1989‚Äì1990) *Alain Saintard ‚Äì vocals (1990) *Patricio Albornoz ‚Äì drums (1999) Discography Demos * Pissing into the Mass Grave (1986) * Altazor (1986) * Beyond the Psychotic Redemption (1988) Albums * Massacre (1989) * Psychotic Redemption (2001) * Crematorium (2005) EPs * In Aeternum (2011) Compilations * Back from the Mass Grave (2006) * Pissing into the Mass Grave + Fantasmas (2007) Singles * Mortuary (2011) Not officially released * Demo I (1986) * Demo II (1986) References External links *Enciclopedia del Rock Chileno: Massakre Category:Chilean thrash metal musical groups Category:Chilean death metal musical groups Category:Chilean heavy metal musical groups ","title":"Massakre (band)"},{"id":"34347295","text":"Raymond Slater (22 August 1931 - October 2005) was an English former professional footballer who played in the Football League, as a forward.

Fran√ßois Louis Fournier-Sarlov√®ze (6 September 1773 Sarlat, France ‚Äì 18 January 1827) was a French general of the Napoleonic Wars. He was known as \\"the worst subject of the Grande Arm√©e\\". Biography Born in Sarlat in 1773, his father owned a cabaret. In his youth, he received solid instruction by the monks of his hometown and became a clerk of the prosecutor. In 1791, he went to Paris and entered the army, and the following year became second lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons. Posted to the Army of the Alps, he distinguished himself through his extreme Jacobinist political opinions so that, after Robespierre‚Äôs death, he was deprived of his rank and imprisoned in Lyon. He succeeded in escaping prison and was reinstated in the Army of the North, and afterwards in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse, the most famous army of the French Revolution. In The Encyclopedia of the Sword, Nick Evangelista wrote: > As a young officer in Napoleon's Army, Dupont was ordered to deliver a > disagreeable message to a fellow officer, Fournier, a rabid duellist. > Fournier, taking out his subsequent rage on the messenger, challenged Dupont > to a duel. This sparked a succession of encounters, waged with sword and > pistol, that spanned decades. The contest was eventually resolved when > Dupont was able to overcome Fournier in a pistol duel, forcing him to > promise never to bother him again.The Encyclopedia of the Sword They fought their first duel in 1794 from which Fournier demanded a rematch. This rematch resulted in at least another 30 duels over the next 19 years in which the two officers fought mounted, on foot, with swords, rapiers, sabres and pistols. Again deprived of his rank because of financial dishonesty and illegal absences, he was reinstated once more and became the aide-de-camp of General Pierre Augereau. Involved in the curious affair of Donnadieu and suspected of conspiracy against the First Consul, Fournier was arrested in May 1802, and imprisoned in the Temple, and later in P√©rigueux under house arrest. In Spain In April 1805, he was reinstated again as commander of the 600 men of the expedition of Rear-Admiral Charles Ren√© Magon de M√©dine in Martinique, but never disembarked and returned to France. Protected by Antoine Charles Louis de Lasalle, who found Fournier a good alter ego ready for any and all escapades, he became the commander of his staff and distinguished himself in 1807 in cavalry charges at the battles of Eylau, Guttstadt and Friedland. Fournier-Sarlov√®ze was afterwards send to Spain and between 18 and 23 May 1809, succeeded in defending the town of Lugo for five days with only 1,500 men against 20,000 attackers. He attracted attention once more by giving some slashes of his sabre to an aide-de-camp placed under his orders by State Secretary Pierre Antoine No√´l Bruno, comte Daru, a fact that caused him once again to be placed on leave without pay. Since his services were needed, he set off again with the IX Corps of Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon. He distinguished himself once again in anti-guerrilla operations and in his charge of May 5, 1811, at the Battle of Fuentes de O√±oro, where, with his brigade (two squadrons of the Seventh, Thirteenth and Twentieth Chasseurs √† Cheval), he penetrated and sabred three English infantry squares. In Russia and Germany During the Russian Campaign, he commanded the 31st Brigade of Light Cavalry, composed of the Baden Hussars, the Hessian and Westphalian Chevau-l√©gers. He led a cavalry charge in the Battle of Smolensk. Promoted to general of division on 11 November 1812, Fournier served in 1813 at Gross- Beeren and at Leipzig where he led the 6th Light Cavalry Division in the III Cavalry Corps. He was appointed Count of the Empire, but deprived again of this rank on 26 October 1813, following a verbal dispute with Napoleon. In this notable episode, general Fournier-Sarlov√®ze was sent to the Mayence prison by Napoleon for his defeatist attitude, following defeat at Leipzig. En route to Mayence, his carriage was escorted by a detachment of Gendarmes d'√©lite and was attacked by Russian Cossacks. A gendarme was killed, but the general grabbed the sword of the dead, took the reins of the carriage and with the help of the remaining gendarmes routed the Cossacks. He then returned to his seat and stated \\"Go on! To Mayence!\\".B√©atrice Capelle et Jean-Claude Demory, Mar√©chaux d'Empire, E/P/A, 2008, 288 p. (), ¬´ Fournier-Sarlov√®ze, le sabreur extravagant ¬ª. Restored by Louis XVIII Louis XVIII re- established him in his grade in the First Restoration, and Fournier did not serve in the Hundred Days Campaign. In 1819, Louis XVIII permitted him to add the family name of Sarlov√®ze onto his name and promoted him as inspector- general of the cavalry. He also took part in the preparation of the new military code. Death He died on 18 January 1827, aged 53. In popular culture The story of Fournier-Sarlov√®ze and Dupont was fictionalized in Joseph Conrad's short story The Duel (1908). Conrad's short story was adapted to film by Ridley Scott as The Duellists (1977).

In 1993, he formed the Finnish black metal band Horna. Besides Horna, Pystynen has played in several bands of different genres of metal. He founded and has played bass and guitar for Sargeist since 1999. He is also known for playing bass and guitar for Behexen from 2004‚Äì2015. Pystynen also has several solo and smaller projects which, in some, he plays all instruments and sings for. Pystynen has a wide interest in playing instruments, being a live session musician, as well as writing lyrics. He is also trained in programming, mixing and engineering music. He owned and ran Grievantee Productions, and Warmoon Records. Ville also owns his own recording studio. Pystynen is said to be inspired by Quorthon and has stated that Bathory has a massive influence on Horna's existence. He has also said to be inspired by bands such as Impaled Nazarene, Emperor and Darkthrone.http://www.oocities.org/SinfulObscurity/horna_interview.htm Work as a lyricist Pystynen writes most of Horna's lyrics in Finnish with many recurring themes. Apart from usual black metal themed lyrics, Pystynen writes about fantasy and the works of J. R. R. Tolkien.http://www.masterful- magazine.com/wywiad.php?wyw=609 For example, Kohti Yhdeks√§n Nousua (Towards Rising of the Nine) refers to Tolkien's ring wraiths, and 'A Ring to Rule' (which is uncommonly written in English) from the 1999 EP Perim√§ Vihassa Ja Verikostossa, regards the One Ring. There are also some Horna lyrics which regard themes from World War II, for example, Oi Kallis Kotimaa (O'Precious Fatherland) from Musta Kaipuu. According to Shatraug, a large record label approached Horna and attempted to negotiate with them to join their label. Pystynen refused, however, as the label wanted them to use more lyrics in English. Personal life Pystynen belonged to the Finnish military service in 2000. He was kicked out for being violent toward a commanding officer.http://www.canadianassault.com/hornainterviewnew.htm He is married, and is the father of two children.

History On 21 December 1904, in the first year of the Herero and Namaqua War, Uibis was the scene of a battle between the Bethanie Nama people and the German colonisers of South-West Africa. The Germans won the battle; the inhabitants fled the area. In 1971 the South African administration formed tribal homelands known as bantustans. Uisib became part of Namaland, forming its most western point. Members of the «ÄKhowesin (Witbooi Orlam) tribe were forcibly resettled here. They established a school in 1978 and form the core of Uisib's community until . Development and infrastructure Uisib is marked by poverty and neglect. Although the settlement has been electrified around 2010 residents cannot afford to pay for that service. Water is supplied by a borehole equipped with a wind pump. When there is no wind, water supply is interrupted. The majority of the inhabitants are elderly people surviving on old-age grants. The roads connecting Uisib to neighbouring towns are poorly maintained. Commercial activities include gardening in the riverbed of the ephemeral Hutup River, and small livestock farming.

He started his professional career at Rangers F.C. in 1998. A central midfielder, Kelly has played for top division clubs in New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. During his career at Auckland City FC they won the Oceania Champions League 2010/11, qualifying for the FIFA World Club Cup in Japan 2011. Football career Glasgow Rangers Kelly started his career with Rangers Youth. During his early career he was also a youth player with Heart of Midlothian, Blackburn Rovers and Manchester United. At 14 he made his debut for the Rangers youth team and made his reserve team debut aged 16. In 1996, aged 15 he rejected to sign for Heart of Midlothian, Blackburn Rovers, Manchester United, French club RC Strasbourg and signed with Rangers. Shettleston FC In August 2001 Kelly's contract was not renewed at Rangers. Contracts at Hibernian, St Mirren and Los Angeles Galaxy (work permit), were not successful and eventually signed a one-year contract to play non-league football at Shettleston before the summer transfer window closed in August 2001, where he played alongside former Celtic and Republic of Ireland international Tommy Coyne. Kellys goals helped Shettleston win the league and cup double. East Stirlingshire FC Kelly joined East Stirlingshire after 1 year at Shettleston on a free transfer, as agreed in his contract. Despite East Stirlingshire's poor performances, Kelly scored goals consistently in what was the clubs poorest run of form in their club history. At the end of the 2004 season Kelly had interest from several clubs but signed for 2 years with Canterbury United in New Zealand. Canterbury United Kelly played from 2004 to 2007 for Canterbury United. The New Zealand Knights in 2004 asked Kelly to test and despite an impressive showing he was injured for 4 months and was not offered a contract. In the 2005/06 season Canterbury reached the New Zealand Football Championship grand final, with Kelly scoring two goals in the 90 minutes against Auckland City FC. The game finished 3‚Äì3 after extra time and, despite Kelly scoring a penalty, Canterbury were defeated in a sudden death shoot out. The game was broadcast on Sky Sports in Australia and brought interest from A-League club Newcastle Jets and Oakleigh Cannons. Kelly was also Canterbury United captain for the 2007/08 season before departing for Australia. Oakleigh Cannons and South Melbourne FC In 2008 Kelly signed for Australian Club Oakleigh Cannons, playing under former Glasgow Rangers and Scotland player Stuart Munro. Inside conflict at the club led to Kelly's departure and he signed with South Melbourne FC as a defensive midfielder. His time at South Melbourne FC was cut short when he suffered a broken leg during a freak training ground collision. Australian A-League clubs were monitoring his good performances but he returned to New Zealand for rehabilitation. Otago United In September 2008 Kelly returned to the New Zealand Football Championship signing 1-year with Otago United with former international Terry Phelan as his coach. Otago United narrowly missed out on the play-offs in season 2009/10. During season 2010 Kelly saw a move to the Israeli Premier League with Maccabi Ahi Nazareth F.C.,collapse with him then rejecting terms with Israeli First Division club Hapoel Marmorek F.C. Auckland City FC Kelly returned to New Zealand, signing for 1 season with Auckland City FC in September 2010. Auckland City FC won the Oceania Champions League 2011 and were closely beaten in the 2010/11 New Zealand Football Championship grand final going down 3‚Äì2 to Waitakere United to an injury time winning goal.

Khonkaen FC In January 2011 Kelly signed a pre contract agreement with Thai Premier League club Khonkaen F.C., on a 2-year contract running from April 2011 and ending April 2013. Former England assistant coach John Gorman and his son Nick assisted the move. Kelly made his d√©but against BEC Tero just five days after winning the 2010‚Äì11 OFC Champions League with Auckland City FC. Ayeyawady United F.C. of the Myanmar Premier League and playing AFC Cup 2012 spoke to Kelly in March 2012 to sign him for only the AFC Cup, but thought he was an Asian visa player. OPS and PK-37 Kelly played three league games on trial with Oulun Palloseura in Finland, before signing for PK-37 one division below until the end of August. Kelly's contract was extended to the end of the season, but he did not re-sign for the 2013 season. In January 2013, Kelly signed for Nakhon Pathom United but left when the head coach was sacked prior to the start of the season. A brief trial with Thai Premier League club Army United ended with the club needing an Asian visa player instead. Kelly did not sign for another club after the passing of both parents in March.

The wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar. A variety of wings and engines can be fitted, each with a different model designation. When equipped with a Rotax 503 or Rotax 582 two-stroke engine the aircraft is designated as a Phase II and when equipped with a Rotax 912 four-stroke engine is designated as a Phase III. Wings used include the double surface Top 12.9, Top 14.9, Chronos 16 and the single surface Zoom 19. The wing designation reflects the area in square metres. The landing gear features gas-filled shock absorber suspension on all three wheels, nose wheel steering and a nose wheel-mounted drum brake, as well as a parking brake. The aircraft can be disassembled for storage or ground transportation, taking half an hour for set-up.

Ibaliidae differ from most of the cynipoids by the larvae being parasitoids on other wasp larvae in the group Siricidae. The Ibaliidae comprise three extant genera of fairly large wasps, with a total of 20 species, and is a sister group to the rest of the cynipoids except the small subfamily Austrocynipidae. Description Their large size is a typical and obvious characteristic in the family, with lengths up to . The following distinct features are diagnostic characters, based on research by Ronquist and Liu and Nordlander. Body The genae are swollen and pronounced. The female antenna consists of 11 segments, while the male antenna consists of 13 segments. A large portion of the pronotum is well developed, called the dorsal pronotal area, with scutellar processes. The marginal cell of the forewing is elongated and thin. The gaster is long and pronouncedly compressed laterally. The seventh tergum is large in females. An apical tubular process is present on the second tarsomere of the hind leg. The metafemur is short, no longer than the metacoxa. Ibalia leucospoides, note the compressed gaster {cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"border: none;\\" |+ Ibalia rufipes with Ibaliidae characteristics marked out ! Mesosoma ! Forewing ! Hind tarsus |- border=\\"0\\" valign=\\"bottom\\" align=\\"center\\"  } Reproduction and parasitism The female lays the egg by oviposition through the oviposition shafts created by Siricidae, and the egg is deposited inside a siricid larva. In the species Ibalia drewseni Borries, Ibalia leucospoides (Hochenwarth) and Ibalia japonica Matsumura, host detection by symbiotic fungus in the siricid has been observed. The larva lives it in its first instars as an endoparasite, and later exits the host and lives on the remaining host tissues. The primary instar is polypodeiform with paired appendages on segments 1‚Äì12, and in the second to fourth instars, the appendages are lost. Until the terminal instar, the remaining cauda is gradually decreased. { Ibalia rufipes egg Ibaliidae larva |} The two subgenera of Ibalia differ in host choice, the subgenus Ibalia parasitizes coniferous-living Siricinae larvae and the subgenus Tremibalia parasitizes hardwood-living Tremicinae larvae. Few details are known about the genera Heteribalia and Eileenella, but both also parasitize wood-boring Siricidae. Sirex cyaneus, host of Ibalia leucospoides Pest control Several species in the genus Ibalia have been introduced to South America, Australia, and New Zealand, sometimes to control previous accidentally introduced Siricidae species parasitizing economically important pine forests. Species used are, for example, Ibalia leucospoides and I. ensiger Norton. Results from introductions vary, and studies of long-term effects are lacking, but in some areas, the effects on pests have been successful; Siricidae populations have been strongly limited. They are most effective in combination with other parasitoid organisms, such as nematodes. Distribution and evolution The Ibaliidae are concentrated to the Northern Hemisphere, the single species in Eileenella found in Papua New Guinea is the only specimen reported to be naturally occurring in the Southern Hemisphere. Ibalia is the most widespread and diverse genus, with the subgenus Tremibalia concentrated in China and the eastern Palearctic realm, and Ibalia in the western Nearctic realm. Heteribalia only occurs in South Asia and Japan. Phylogenetic analyses have indicated the Ibaliidae have spread from the eastern Palearctic and northern Asian regions in the early Cretaceous. An insect-parasitic life mode is probably ancestral in the cynipoid families, and the Ibaliidae are placed next to Austrocynipidae, as a sister group to Liopteridae, Figitidae and Cynipidae.

It has to be noted that a scientific-misconduct scandal, involving Harvard professor Piero Anversa, might indicate that the heart stem cell concept be broken.https://ipscell.com/2018/10/call-for-31-anversa-retractions-by-harvard- heart-stem-cell-concept-broken/ Therefore, the following article should be read with caution, as it builds on Anversa's results. Endogenous cardiac stem cells were first discovered in 2003 by Bernardo Nadal-Ginard, Piero Anversa and colleagues in the adult rat heart and since then have been identified and isolated from mouse, dog, porcine and human hearts. The adult heart was previously thought to be a post mitotic organ without any regenerative capability. The identification of eCSCs has provided an explanation for the hitherto unexplained existence of a subpopulation of immature cycling myocytes in the adult myocardium. Indeed, recent evidence from a genetic fate-mapping study established that stem cells replenish adult mammalian cardiomyocytes lost by cardiac wear and tear and injury throughout the adult life. Moreover, it is now accepted that myocyte death and myocyte renewal are the two sides of the proverbial coin of cardiac homeostasis in which the eCSCs play a central role. These findings produced a paradigm shift in cardiac biology and opened new opportunities and approaches for future treatment of cardiac diseases by placing the heart squarely amongst other organs with regenerative potential such as the liver, skin, muscle, CNS. However, they have not changed the well- established fact that the working myocardium is mainly constituted of terminally differentiated contractile myocytes. This fact does not exclude, but is it fully compatible with the heart being endowed with a robust intrinsic regenerative capacity which resides in the presence of the eCSCs throughout the individual lifespan. Briefly, eCSCs have been first identified through the expression of c-kit, the receptor of the stem cell factor and the absence of common hematopoietic markers, like CD45. Afterwards, different membrane markers (Sca-1, Abcg-2, Flk-1) and transcription factors (Isl-1, Nkx2.5, GATA4) have been employed to identify and characterize these cells in the embryonic and adult life. eCSCs are clonogenic, self-renewing and multipotent in vitro and in vivo, capable of generating the 3 major cell types of the myocardium: myocytes, smooth muscle and endothelial vascular cells. They express several markers of stemness (i.e. Oct3/4, Bmi-1, Nanog) and have significant regenerative potential in vivo. When cloned in suspension they form cardiospheres, which when cultured in a myogenic differentiation medium, attach and differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes. In 2012, it was proposed that Isl-1 is not a marker for endogenous cardiac stem cells. That same year, a different group demonstrated that Isl-1 is not restricted to second heart field progenitors in the developing heart, but also labels cardiac neural crest. It has also been reported that Flk-1 is not a specific marker for endogenous and mouse ESC-derived Isl1+ CPCs. While some eCSC discoveries have been brought into question, there has been success with other membrane markers. For instance, it was demonstrated that the combination of Flt1+/Flt4+ membrane markers identifies an Isl1+/Nkx2.5+ cell population in the developing heart. It was also shown that endogenous Flt1+/Flt4+ cells could be expanded in vitro and displayed trilineage differentiation potential. Flt1+/Flt4+ CPCs derived from iPSCs were shown to engraft into the adult myocardium and robustly differentiate into cardiomyocytes with phenotypic and electrophysiologic characteristics of adult cardiomyocytes. With the myocardium now recognized as a tissue with limited regenerating potential, harbouring eCSCs that can be isolated and amplified in vitro for regenerative protocols of cell transplantation or stimulated to replicate and differentiate in situ in response to growth factors, it has become reasonable to exploit this endogenous regenerative potential to replace lost/damaged cardiac muscle with autologous functional myocardium.

Built about 1808, it is one of the oldest brick houses in Putney, and one of its finest examples of Federal architecture in brick. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Its current owners operate it as the Hickory Ridge House Bed and Breakfast Inn. Description and history The Crawford House is located north of Putney Village, on the south side of Hickory Ridge Road, just south of the private Grammar School. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a side gable roof and granite foundation. The north and east walls are laid in Flemish bond, and the other two sides are laid in American bond. A two-story gable-roofed wood frame ell extends south from the main block. The front facade, facing north to the street, is symmetrically arranged, with a center entry framed by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight window. Above the entrance on the second level is a Palladian window; the remaining windows are rectangular sash windows, set below blind semi-oval transoms. The interior retains significant original woodwork and hardware. The house was built in 1807-09 by Theophilus Crawford, a local farmer and sawmill owner. Crawford regularly traveled to Boston, Massachusetts to sell his dairy products, and is said to have brought the window glass from there. The brick was probably sourced at a local brickyard in East Putney. It was probably the first brick house to be built in the town, and is one of the first relatively high-style Federal houses to be built in southeastern Vermont. It remained in the Crawford family until 1913, a relatively long period for the region. It has housed a bed and breakfast inn since 1986.

Biography He was born of a good and old Serbian family in Ripanj, about 25 kilometers south of Belgrade at the foot of Avala mountain, on the fourth of June 1831. When Miliƒáeviƒá was a teenager his parents moved to Belgrade. Having received his early education at the gymnasium of Belgrade (1845), he entered the Grande √©cole (Velika ≈°kola), and engaged in the study of religion and education. Although Miliƒáeviƒá did specially distinguish himself as a student, ill health prevented him from going to Russia to pursue further studies. University life, however, had considerable influence in the development of his character and furnished him with much of his literary material. After taking a degree in 1850, he taught school in the Serbian heartland Lesnik (Serbia), and in 1851 at Topola. In early 1852 Miliƒáeviƒá took a clerical post at the courthouse in Valjevo, and was soon transferred to a similar post in Belgrade before joining the Ministry of Culture and Religious Affairs in 1852. Three years later Miliƒáeviƒá transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there he remained until 1861. From then until 1880 he served as secretary of the Ministry of Education. In 1884 the Minister of Education took him as his assistant, and in 1886 he became head librarian of the National Library of Belgrade. He entered the Skup≈°tina (Parliament) as a representative of a Belgrade constituency and as a member of the Progressive Party, led by Milutin Gara≈°anin, son of Ilija Gara≈°anin, and Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá. From 1896 to 1899 he was the president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and in 1899 he retired. In 1901 he celebrated his 50th anniversary as a pedagogue and novelist. He died at Belgrade in 1908. Miliƒáeviƒá was awarded Order of the Cross of Takovo and Order of Saint Sava. Work Scholar Miliƒáeviƒá was an indefatigable pedagogue and a prolific writer, so that he left behind him, as the fruit of his labours, a large number of books, novels, and monographs. From 1868 to 1876 Miliƒáeviƒá edited ≈†kola (School), a tri-monthly scholastic journal. He was a voluminous writer on educational subjects, and was the author of various school-textbooks. He authored 100 books, including several novels, and published hundreds of studies, papers, monographs, and learned articles. Among his pedagological textbooks were: Schools in Serbia (1868); A Study Guide (1869); Pedagological Studies (1870); School Hygiene (1870); History of Pedagogy (1871); School Discipline (1871); Adolf Diesterweg (1871); Schools for the Rights of Citizens and Responsibilities (1873); etc. When Miliƒáeviƒá was appointed secretary of the Ministry of Education he immediately put into practice methods of the most celebrated reformers of education of the past and present, Dositej Obradoviƒá (Serbia), Teodor Jankoviƒá-Mirijevski (Austria and Russia), Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi (Switzerland), Friedrich Fr√∂bel (Germany), Adolph Diesterweg (Germany), Ferdinand Buisson (France), and others. He translated the works of the great French writers, philosophers and educators of his time, Paris in America by √âdouard Laboulaye (1863); Moral History of Women (1876) and Fathers and Children in the Nineteenth Century (Vols. 1 & 2, 1872 and 1873) by Ernest Legouv√©; Women of the 20th Century by Jules Simon; √âmile by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and works by Montesquieu (Persian Letters) and Jules Sandeau (Galebova stena). Miliƒáeviƒá translated Russian author Alexander Hilferding's history of the Serbians and Bulgarians, Pisma o istoriji Srba i Bugara, and Ignaty Potapenko's 1892 short story Istinska sluzba (True Vocation). He also began recruiting the best minds in academia. A well-known pedagogue, Dr. Vojislav Bakiƒá (1847‚Äì1929), early in 1875 decided to move to Belgrade from Zagreb. He requested Milan Miliƒáeviƒá to help him find a job in Serbia. Miliƒáeviƒá noted in his diary January 8, 1875: \\"I am happy about it because our national education will acquire a hard-working,competent, educated and erudite scholar.\\" Bakiƒá, author of Srpsko rodoljublje i otaƒçastvoljublje, stressed freedom and equality even more than brotherhood. He advocated the education of girls to prepare for their patriotic mission. Historian and Ethnologist His first books dealt with the history, geography, and customs of his people. In 1857 he published two books, The Serbian Peasant and Serbian Towns which attracted some attention. It was followed by a three more book entitled The Life of Serbian Peasants (Vol 1, 1868; Vol. 2, 1873; Vol 3, 1877). In his early years, Miliƒáeviƒá acquired a love of national customs and traditions which his humanist education never obliterated, while, in addition, he learned to know the whole range of our popular literature (Narodne pesme) -- legends, songs and fairy tales which were collected and published by Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá. These circumstances explain the richness of his vocabulary and joined to an ardent patriotism they fitted him to become a political leader and a leading scholar, proponent of the Vukovian School (Vukova ≈°kola). As a scholar, he gave a fresh impulse to Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's reforms in his early and later works. At the time, there were many historians who raised methodological questions. A step towards broader views and the application of modern European methodological principles was taken through the works of Milan Djakov Miliƒáeviƒá, Jovan Skerliƒá and Jovan Cvijiƒá. He has written: * Lessons in Civil Rights and Responsibilities (1873) * Principality of Serbia (1876) * Serbian Peasant Life (in the Glasnik: 1867 and 1875) * Kingdom of Serbia (1884) * The stories of Serbian life in the 19th century: \\"Jurmusa i Fatima\\" and \\"White Evenings\\" (1879) * Biographies of Famous People in Present-day Serbia/Pomenik znamenitih ljudi u srpskog naroda novijega doba (1888) * Petar Jokiƒá: Events and People in the First Serbian Uprising (1891) * Prince Milo≈° and His Story (1891) * Karaƒëorƒëe (1903) * Monument/Pomenik znameniti ljudi u srpskoga naroda novijega doba (1888) In the introduction of his Principality of Serbia (1876), Miliƒáeviƒá concluded in didactic verse: \\"Knowledge is enlightenment, will is might, let us work, day and night.\\" From 1873 to his death his work was educational, with the exception of a short stint in politics before his retirement. As president of the Learned Society, Miliƒáeviƒá enlarged the resources and number of the institution, which had hundreds of members by the turn of the century. In other fields, he promoted common school education (especially manual training), the work of the public library, and took an active part in the discussion of women's rights, economics, statistical and other public questions, holding many offices of honor and responsibility. As an author, he wrote on the government treatment of the poor, underprivileged, and general political economy besides producing monographs on the life of Petar Jokiƒá, a buljukbasha of Karadjordje's guard who died in 1852, and the history of Serbia in his own time. In 1878 the Serbian Learned Society (Srpsko uƒçeno dru≈°tvo) elected Slovak professor Janko ≈†afarik (father of Pavle ≈†afarik), Milan Djakov Miliƒáeviƒá and Serbian painter Stevan Todoroviƒá to collect ethnographic objects in Serbia for an exhibit at the Pan-Slavic Congress in St. Peterburg. Miliƒáeviƒá and Todoroviƒá selected 600 national costumes and Todoroviƒá supplied twenty photographs from Serbia. Officially, however, it was Milan Miliƒáeviƒá who led the delegation, both as the chief delegate of the Serbian Learned Society and by virtue of his fluency in the Russian language. Politics Portrait of Miliƒáeviƒá by Stevan Todoroviƒá, National Museum of Serbia As a politician Miliƒáeviƒá had an active career with the Progressive Party, led by Milutin Gara≈°anin, son of Ilija Gara≈°anin, and Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá. The Progressive Party sprang from the group of young conservatives, imbued with Western liberalism. Their better known regional leaders were Milan Piroƒáanac, ƒåedomilj Mijatoviƒá, historian Stojan Novakoviƒá, poet Milan Kujund≈æiƒá-Aberdar, poet, novelist and dramatist Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin, and Milan ƒêakov Miliƒáeviƒá. From 1896 he entered the Skup≈°tina (Serbian Parliament) as representative of a Belgrade constituency, representing the Progressive Party, but decided three years later to retire. Miliƒáeviƒá believed that the solidarity of Slavic nations should recognize and not repudiate the principle of distinctive national differences while contributing to the mutual respect and understanding of all humankind. Professing advanced Liberal and democratic views, he often had to defend personal freedoms to those who were used to strong-arm tactics. \\"From many sides our friends complain how the Radicals are upsetting them,\\" Miliƒáeviƒá wrote in his diary, \\"They do not understand that this is a consequence of freedom and blame us that we do not use the state administration to stop them. No! That we will not do!.....\\" Literary Work Literary critic Jovan Skerliƒá classed Miliƒáeviƒá with Stjepan Mitrov Ljubi≈°a (1824‚Äì1878), an excellent Serbian short story writer originally from Montenegro. The two were famed as story tellers, like Joksim Noviƒá-Otoƒçanin and Jovan Sundeƒçiƒá a generation before. In Milan Miliƒçeviƒá's book Pomenik znamenitih ljudi u srpskog narodu novieg doba (Album of the important personalities among the Serbs in modern times), he claimed that Ilija Gara≈°anin's policy in office was guided by the ides presented in the Nacertanije, even though the existence of such a document was at that time unknown only to a few and it remained unpublished until 1906.

Theater, music, visual art, and literature played a role in camp life for many of the millions of prisoners who passed through the Gulag system. Some creative endeavors were initiated and executed by prisoners themselves (sometimes in secret), while others were overseen by the camp administration. Some projects benefited from prisoners who had been professional artists; others were organized by amateurs. The robust presence of the arts in the Gulag camps is a testament to the resourcefulness and resilience of prisoners there, many of whom derived material benefits and psychological comfort from their involvement in artistic projects. Theater and music One of the most visible forms of art within the Gulag was performance. Many prisoners, from experienced actors and musicians to total amateurs, either participated in or attended theatrical productions in the camps. Occasionally, even camp officials became involved: in his memoir Dear America!, Thomas Sgovio describes a production in which the leading role was played by the head of the Camp Administration. Early Gulag theaters The phenomenon of Gulag theater dates back almost as far as the existence of Gulag. Prisoners at Solovetsky prison camp, the USSR's first Gulag camp, started an amateur theater group as early as 1923. Initially, the actors had no access to scripts, so they relied on memorized classics for material. The troupe was not officially recognized, and performers were given no special treatment; they often rehearsed after a full day of labor. The following year, however, the quality of performances at the camp greatly improved with the influx of a group of professional actors who had been arrested together. Notable Gulag theaters By the 1940s, many work camps had developed theater troupes, some completely amateur and others highly accomplished. Directors of certain Gulags became competitive about producing the best theatrical performances, and officials like the commander at Unzhlag would hand-pick talented prisoners to participate. According to Lev Kopelev, the priority that Unzhlag's commander placed on high-quality theater led the camp to become known as an ‚Äúasylum for artists.\\" Talent was plentiful among Gulag prisoners, a number of whom had professional performing experience. The singers Vadim Kozin and Lidia Ruslanova, the actresses Valentina Tokarskaya and Zoya Fyodorova, and a host of other illustrious performers spent time in Gulag camps. Sometimes, too, non-prisoners were hired to supplement the camp's supply of performers. (This was the case in the theater at Vorkuta, where a professional director from Moscow was hired for certain shows.) The commander at Ukhtizhimlag, a camp in Ukhta, organized what writer and prisoner Lev Razgon called ‚Äúa real opera troupe‚Äù featuring a soprano from the Harbin operetta, a dancer from the Bolshoi Ballet, and a well-known viola-player. The troupe's director was Konstantin Egert, an actor from the Maly Theater who had starred in the 1926 film The Legend of the Bear‚Äôs Wedding. Performances at Ukhta rivaled those of professional companies in cities like Moscow. The imposing building that once housed the Ukhtizhimlag theater still stands in Ukhta today. The Dalstroy industrial construction trust, whose operation was based mainly on labor camps in the Kolyma region centered around the city of Magadan, emerged as a cultural hub with the arrival of director Ivan Fedorovich Nikishov in 1939. Nikishov and his staff sought to bolster their own prestige by creating a flourishing arts scene at Magadan. To that end, they built several new theaters and playhouses throughout the city. Dalstroy developed a renowned theater troupe known as the Sevvostlag Club (Klub USVITL), which included many professional singers and dancers from among the local camps‚Äô prisoners. The troupe performed mainly for the higher-up officials in Magadan but also sent ‚Äúcultural brigades‚Äù to entertain officials and prisoners throughout Kolyma. Types of performances staged Gulag theater represented a wide variety of genres, from drama to dance performances to operas and operettas. Material was often (although not entirely) controlled by camp officials, who would make requests and censor plays and songs that a troupe intended to stage. Soviet propaganda was encouraged, and a certain amount of pro-Soviet material did end up being performed, including plays like The Russian Question (which follows an American journalist whose bosses force him to slander the USSR). Most troupes, however, preferred the classics and popular pieces. In its early years, the theater at Solovetsky performed Anton Chekhov‚Äôs Uncle Vanya, Maxim Gorky‚Äôs Children of the Sun, and plays by Leonid Andreyev and Nikolai Gogol; it also held acrobatic and orchestral performances and films. At Vorkuta, performers staged the operas Eugene Onegin (by Alexander Pushkin) and Rigoletto (by Giuseppe Verdi). One troupe at Magadan performed operettas including Marketplace of Brides, Rose-Maria, and selections from Dona Juanita and Kholopka. The actress Tamara Petkevich appeared in Chekhov‚Äôs Jubilee and The Bear. Razgon reports that performers at Ustvymlag staged ‚Äúthe most fashionable plays of the day,‚Äù including Gusev's Glory and Korneichuk's Plato Krechet, and singers sang popular songs like ‚Äú The Blue Scarf,‚Äù ‚ÄúSeagull,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou are waiting, Lizaveta.‚Äù He also recalls attending a performance of Emmerich K√°lm√°n‚Äôs opera Silva. Often, the stress and isolation of Gulag life prompted prisoners and officials alike to request positive and optimistic works rather than melancholy ones. Comedic acts were usually a great success. The theater troupe at Veselaya performed Shkvarkin‚Äôs comedy A Stranger‚Äôs Child and Karatygin‚Äôs vaudeville Dear Uncle on Three Legs, and Dimitri Panin‚Äôs memoir The Notebooks of Sologdin recounts the antics of a professional clown named Feigin. Prison bands More than other types of performance, music in the Gulag was often closely involved with the actual labor. Several camps incorporated music into the prisoners‚Äô workdays. Sometimes, individual musicians or entire bands would accompany prisoners as they assembled in brigades and marched to work. Kazimierz Zarod describes how the camp band, consisting of a mix of amateurs and professionals who ‚Äútogether...made quite good music,‚Äù would be stationed at the gate each morning to play military-style music as prisoners set off for work. Tenor Vadim Kozin, Eddie Rosner's band performed in Kolyma region. Treatment of performers The treatment of performers involved in Gulag theater varied widely over time and among the different camps. Solovetsky's earliest theater group was completely voluntary and self-organized, and the actors (all amateurs) were afforded no special privileges. Like other prisoners, they put in full workdays clearing forests, and they had to schedule rehearsals during the few hours they had free. The musicians who comprised the band in Kazimierz Zarod's camp were also treated like non-performers: after the prisoners had passed through the gates on their way to work in the forest, the musicians simply put down their instruments and joined the march at the end of the line. As the theater became a more prominent part of Gulag life, though, performers did begin to enjoy certain advantages, from work exemptions to better living quarters. Many performers were given extra rations and more comfortable beds and assigned easy or ‚Äúsoft‚Äù jobs instead of the hard labor demanded of other prisoners. In Unzhlag during the 1940s, performers were regularly employed to be nurses or clean the hospital; at Dmitlag, members of the camp orchestra received special clothing, including officers‚Äô boots. Actors and musicians at Ustvymlag were registered as part of the ‚Äúweak team,‚Äù occupying spots that would otherwise have been filled by the ailing and crippled, to avoid their having to go out to work. Sgovio recalls that all of the camp musicians slept in an unusually luxurious barrack and had ‚Äúsoft jobs‚Äîthe cook, the barber, the bath manager, the accountants, etc.‚Äù Inmates who had been famous artists prior to their arrest might receive even more preferential treatment: the well-known tenor Pechkovsky, for example, was housed separately from other workers and regularly dined with officials‚Äô wives on delicacies like butter and hot port wine. For non-celebrity prisoners, winning officials‚Äô favor with a successful performance could sometimes mean the difference between keeping one's position and being transferred to a more strenuous job or a harsher camp. Dimitri Panin writes about a clown named Feigin who saved himself from transfer to a penal camp by performing a humorous dance for camp officials at their New Year's Eve party. Many artists felt they gained spiritual as well as material benefits from being allowed to perform. Playing a role helped actors forget the brutal reality of their situation and provided a temporary escape from the hunger and oppression that characterized imprisonment. Georgy Feldgun, a violinist in the Dalstroy orchestra, reported that he ‚Äúbreathed the full air of freedom‚Äù while performing. Prisoners who had no performing experience sometimes taught themselves acting or music so they too could experience the relief it provided; Alexander Dolgun, for example, arranged for a fellow inmate to teach him guitar chords so he could play while the other men in the barracks sang. To actress Tamara Petkevich, the circumstances of the Gulag made performing an even deeper emotional experience; a particularly moving performance could feel like ‚Äúthe resurrection of the normal world.‚Äù But even when they reaped material and psychological benefits, performers were still considered prisoners, and most aspects of their lives were far from comfortable. After a performance, singers in the renowned Ukhta opera troupe changed from their colorful costumes into plain uniforms and were ushered back to their quarters by guards who cursed and prodded them impatiently. Razgon describes witnessing this process and being shocked to see the faces that had appeared ‚Äúhandsome, young, happy and elegant‚Äù in the operetta overcome by exhaustion and despair, ‚Äújust like the rest of us.‚Äù In The Gulag Archipelago, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn recalls how, at the larger theaters in Vorkuta, Norilsk, and Solikamsk, armed guards waited behind the scenes to escort performers whose acts had been well- received back to camp and to lead those who had not been so successful to the punishment block. Although they may have had lighter work, performers were still treated like slaves; they were still at the mercy of camp officials, and female actresses were often forced to become commanders‚Äô mistresses. Indeed, even though they enjoyed superior treatment, actors in the Gulag faced the unique psychological pressure of having to portray free men and women while remaining enslaved themselves. It may have been this challenge that led to particularly high suicide rates among performers. Still, involvement in a camp theater almost always meant a reprieve from at least some of the hardships of Gulag life. Actress Tatyana Leshchenko-Sukhomlina wrote in her autobiography that being accepted into her camp's theatrical troupe was ‚Äúa great stroke of luck, for it meant working in a warm building and countless other benefits.‚Äù Simeon Vilensky, a Gulag survivor who later studied theater in the camps, confirmed that, all things considered, prisoners who participated in theatrical performances had a higher likelihood of survival than their counterparts who worked in the mines. Significance of theater to non- performers Even prisoners who were not directly involved in Gulag theater benefited from the opportunity to attend performances, which may explain why they seldom displayed resentment toward the performers (in spite of the preferential treatment members of theatrical troupes enjoyed). Just as actors saw participating in theater as a respite from the harsh conditions of the Gulag, performances afforded prisoner audiences a distraction from their plight and the moral support they needed to survive brutal workdays. Simeon Vilensky recalled that actors, singers, and dancers in the camps ‚Äúhelped other people to remain people.‚Äù Camp officials benefited at least as much as ordinary prisoners from the entertainment their theaters offered. Some of the most renowned troupes, such as Dalstroy's during the 1940s, performed almost exclusively for camp staff. Many directors came to view the quality of their camp theater as a status symbol and competed with one another to produce the most impressive performances. Theater troupes were regularly sent on tour to exhibit their talent to officials at neighboring camps. Officials also took advantage of the camp performances as a way of motivating and rewarding other workers. Sometimes musicians accompanied prisoners as they marched to work in the mornings; at other camps, bands were reserved for special occasions, playing only for workers who met or exceeded their production quota. Razgon recalled that the theatrical club in Vozhael occasionally performed for whichever of several nearby camps achieved the best ‚Äúoutput.‚Äù Soviet cultural critic Boris Gusman, who had served as assistant director of the Bolshoi Theatre and director of the Music Committee for the Soviet Arts Counsel, died in Vozhael in 1944. Propaganda and the arts In addition to prisoner- generated art, a certain amount of culture and creativity in the Gulags was encouraged‚Äîeven mandated‚Äîby the government. The Cultural-Educational Department, or Kulturno-Vospitatelnaya Chast (KVCh), was an organization conceived with the ostensible goal of ‚Äúre-educating‚Äù prisoners to help them adjust to the expectations, conditions, and purposes of the camps. The earliest KVChs (which formed in the 1920s under the title ‚ÄúPolitical Educational Sections‚Äù) were meant to provide a communist substitute for prison priests and religious services. In practice, their main function was to supply propaganda intended to boost the camps‚Äô production. They also served simply to keep inmates occupied, since excessive free time might, authorities feared, lead prisoners to revert to their former criminal habits. The KVCh at each camp was headed by a free employee charged with selecting and supervising instructors, workers who usually enjoyed more comfortable treatment than other prisoners and were not required to participate in hard labor. By the 1940s, every camp was supposed to have at least one KVCh instructor and a building (called the KVCh ‚Äúclub‚Äù) where performances, lectures, and discussions could be held. Generally, the KVCh's efforts targeted criminal prisoners rather than political ones, who were considered unlikely to respond to re-education. Theoretically, at least, inmates chosen to be instructors should come from lower-class backgrounds, and in some KVCh-produced theatricals, political prisoners were allowed only to play instruments, not to speak or sing. The extent of the KVCh's involvement in prisoners‚Äô lives varied. Gustav Herling recalled that the KVCh at his camp did nothing except maintain a small library and sometimes organize inmate performances. The KVCh at Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's camp was slightly more active: it was responsible for, among other duties, producing three amateur theatrical performances each year and supplying materials for artists to decorate the compound. At other camps, the KVCh published newspapers, hung propagandistic posters, organized lectures, deployed brigades of prisoners to encourage other workers with pro-Soviet songs, showed films, and sponsored various other ‚Äúself-taught creative activities,‚Äù including sports and board games. Although the KVCh was supposed to provide opportunities for artistic expression, apathetic officials and heavy censorship sometimes hindered its effectiveness. At some camps, though the KVCh purported to produce regular theatrical shows, the only performances that actually took place were for the benefit of outsiders. Solzhenitsyn describes the chief of his KVCh, expecting a visit from a superior officer, ordering a bewildered worker with almost no musical experience to organize a choir. Herling reported that the selection at his KVCh library was limited to multiple copies of Stalin‚Äôs Problems of Leninism, other pro-Soviet texts, and a few Russian classics. Material for performances was similarly restricted; if prisoners tried to contribute to the planning of shows, KVCh officials scrutinized the program and any potentially subversive pieces were axed. Despite these frustrations, though, most inmates took full and enthusiastic advantage of the creative opportunities offered by the KVCh. Even workers who had no interest in theater often enlisted in performances because the rehearsal schedule allowed them more liberty to move around the camp. For others, the excitement of participation even in KVCh-supervised shows offered a welcome ‚Äúreminder...that life despite everything still exists.‚Äù Herling describes how prisoners who were already exempt from work for medical reasons would volunteer eagerly to help clean and decorate the ‚Äúcultural‚Äù barrack before a concert. Originally intended to inspire prisoners to work harder, the KVCh became, for many, a much-needed source of moral support in the face of isolation, hunger, exhaustion, and dehumanizing labor conditions. Visual art Visual art in the Gulag camps was either controlled through the KVCh or practiced in private and concealed. Visual art in the KVCh In the KVCh, artists were commissioned to contribute to the d√©cor of the camp. This work was known as \\"soft labor,\\" and the artists chosen for the job were considered to become \\"trusties\\" of the officials. Some artists felt morally opposed to such work, but the luxuries it provided, including access to better food, made the work enviable among prisoners. Artists in the KVCh were responsible for maintaining the camp's image. Among other tasks, they were assigned to paint number tags for inmates, communist slogans and placards for the camps, bulletins with updated work percentages of the brigades, and portraits of Stalin. Some artists were assigned to paint idealized portraits of fellow inmates, which could be sent home in place of photographs to mask the horrors of the prisoners‚Äô lives. The culture clubs and barracks were also decorated by KVCh artists. Painters reproduced famous nineteenth-century Russian paintings, often of the Peredvizhniki School, to be hung in the administrative buildings. Thomas Sgovio, an Italian-American artist, was provided with an art studio in the OLP Mestprom where he and two other artists worked full-time to reproduce famous paintings which were then sold to the free-citizens. Ingenuity of Gulag artists In the absence of standard art supplies, artists in the Gulag had to create their own, working from what materials they could scrounge up in the camps. Artists who did not have the luxury of rule-bending officials or the structure of the KVCh to support them had to be especially innovative. Artists learned to use whatever they could get their hands on. Paint could be made by mixing dried powdered clay with oatmeal. Those with access to swine used pig's blood to thicken and color paint and bristles collected in the pig sties to make paintbrushes. Some artists even learned to make specialized media. Sgovio learned from fellow artists to make oil paints by mixing dried house paint with sunflower-seed oil. Mikhail Sokolov was able to make miniature textured landscapes using clay mixed with tooth powder and powdered medicine. To make canvases, foot-rags, floor mops and flour bags were stretched out against wooden parcel boxes. To make thread for knitting and embroidery, inmates collected loose threads from rags and underwear and held them together with soap. Needles were made from fishbones saved after meals or dug out from frozen waste piles, pieces of wire sharpened to points, or the teeth of combs. Using wire needles and ink made from the rubber of galoshes, burned to ash and mixed with water and sugar, Sgovio developed a technique for tattooing fellow inmates. The sets and costumes for theater productions showcased artists‚Äô abilities to make something out of nothing. Cotton wool was transformed into wigs; medical gauze and fishing nets became lace; bast matting could be made to look like velvet; mess hall stools and canes could be combined to make fine furniture. By a stretch of imagination, artists were able to transform the artifacts of their base conditions into standard scenery, creating for themselves an escape into normalcy. Treatment of artists Treatment of artists varied from camp to camp. Officially, art produced outside of the bounds of the KVCh was prohibited. However, some officials bent the rules, allowing artists to work on the side and sometimes even providing the necessary supplies. In the Solovetsky camps, treatment of artists varied across time. In the 1920s, many artists were allowed to work freely and even given the liberty to produce their own magazine, Solovietski Ostrova (\\"Solovetsky Islands\\"). By the late 1930s, however, with the division of the Gulag into penal colonies and hard labor camps, rules were more strictly enforced and the private production of artwork was suppressed. Some officials took advantage of the presence of skilled artists. Artists were often ordered to paint portraits of the officials and their families. Sgovio was once ordered by the Commandant of Nekiskan to decorate his room, with the most prominent request being a full-sized portrait of ‚Äúa beautiful nude woman,‚Äù to be painted on a bed-sheet. In the absence of specialized craftspeople, artists were often made to work outside of their area of expertise. Anna Andreeva, a painter by trade, recalled being asked to decorate tombstones, make crockery and fix and make new toys for the children of officials. Despite his complete lack of experience with carpentry, Sgovio was assigned in Gerba to work in the carpenter brigade, solely on the basis of a good profile sketch of the ‚ÄúWork Assigner.‚Äù Artists were also employed by camp administrators for special tasks. Oleg Ditmar, a colleague of Sgovio in the Mestprom art studio, worked in the Administration Hospital painting water- colors of patients as visual documentation to be sent to Moscow for case studies. Mikhail Rudakov was assigned to similar work in the hospital of Vorkutlag. In camps with no KVCh and no official staff positions for artists, administrators sometimes bent the rules to allow artists to work for them. In OLP Ekspeditionni, Sgovio was added to the ‚Äúsick list‚Äù so that he could fulfill the unofficial and undocumented position of sign-painter. Art among inmates Artists often received requests from fellow inmates for artwork in exchange for extra rations. The Vory, an organized gang of thieves in the camps, were frequent customers, having stolen enough stores to be able to provide art supplies and pay artists for their work. Sgovio tattooed several of the Vory with nude females, mermaids, text, and even, upon request, a large portrait of Lenin on the chest, so that the recipient \\"wouldn‚Äôt get shot by a firing squad.\\" Sketches of nude women were a common request among inmates, becoming the objects of desire for inmates who had not seen women in years. Sgovio was often asked to sketch nude women for inmates as well as officials. These sketches formed the center of ‚Äòmasturbation orgies‚Äô among inmates. Some inmates also requested artwork to send to their loved ones. Sgovio added a sketched bouquet of roses to a prisoner's love letter, receiving white bread and tobacco in exchange. Survival by art Art became for some artists a means of survival in the camps. By securing soft jobs and access to better food, artists were able to outlive their fellow inmates. Even in the absence of official positions, working on the side earned them extra gruel, water, white bread, butter, sugar, tea and tobacco. In Chai-Urya, known as the ‚ÄúValley of Death,‚Äù Sgovio was on the verge of starvation when the bread distributor requested pictures of nude girls, providing the brigade with extra bread in exchange. Once the word spread that an artist had talent, life in the camps became easier. When the Work Allocator in Chai-Urya heard that Sgovio was an artist, he commissioned him to paint a reproduction of Three Hero- Knights, by Vassnyetsov. For two weeks Sgovio was given extra food and allowed the luxury of sitting and painting all day, during which time he could feel the flesh returning to his starved body. Famous Gulag artists Among the prisoners of the Gulag camps were several well-known artists: Mikhail Sokolov, Boris Sveshnikov, Mikhail Rudakov, Vasily Shukhaev, Solomon Gershov, Julo Sooster, Lev Kropivinitsky, and Fedot F Suchkov. Mikhail Sokolov Mikhail Ksenofontovich Sokolov was a prolific painter and the head of the Proletkult art studio in Moscow (1910), professor at Moscow Art College (1923‚Äì25), Yaroslavl Art and Teacher-Training secondary school (1925‚Äì35) and Moscow Institute of Painters‚Äô and Graphic Artists‚Äô Professional Development (1936‚Äì38). He was arrested 1938 and sentenced to seven years in the Taiga station of the Kemerovo region. While imprisoned he produced miniature landscapes in secret, in the privacy of his bunk. Boris Sveshnikov He was arrested in 1946 along with fellow students for radical anti-Soviet comments and sentenced to eight years in camp. While imprisoned in the Vetlosian camp, he worked in an art shop during his night-watch shift in the woodworking brigade. After release in 1954, Sveshnikov illustrated books for such prominent authors as Hoffman, Maeterlinck, Goethe, and Andersen, among others. Mikhail Rudakov Mikhail Rudakov, a specialist in book illustration, design and painting, was arrested in 1943 and sentenced to five years in the Vorkutlag camp. There he worked in the hospital, sketching patients. In 1949 he was released from prison, but forced to remain in the Arkhangelsk region. There he served as stager designer at the Kotlas Drama Theatre. Vasily Shukhaev Vasily Shukhaev was a painter and professor of painting at the Academy of Arts in Leningrad and the Academy of Architecture in Moscow (1935‚Äì37). He was arrested in 1937 and served eight years in the Kolyma camps, where he was eventually assigned work as stage designer for the Magadan Theatre of Music and Drama. Solomon Gershov was arrested in 1932 for criticizing the Revolution Artists Association. Upon arrest, all of his works were destroyed. He was released in 1934, only to be arrested again in 1948; all of his works destroyed yet again. While serving his second term of 15 years, he was employed as a designer. His paintings have been exhibited in the USSR, London, Washington, New York, Paris and Philadelphia. Julo Sooster , while serving his ten-year sentence in Karlag, made portraits of camp inmates in secret. Many of these were found by officials and destroyed, but some survived until his release in 1956. He remained active as a painter and book illustrator after his release, contributing to exhibitions for the Moscow department of the Soviet Artists Union. Lev Kropivinitsky was imprisoned in the Balkhash area and forced to remain there even after his release from prison. He worked at the Balkhash Palace of Culture, where he was in charge of stage design, direction, and management of the art studio. His graphic art is now displayed in over 100 exhibitions in Russia, the US, France and Czechoslovakia. Fedot Suchkov Now known for his work as a sculptor and poet, was first introduced to sculpting while in the confines of the Minlag camp. After his release, he authored memorial sculptures dedicated to his friends and former inmates Varlam Shalamov and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Literature Although backbreaking labor, dehumanizing treatment, and vigilant officials made reading and writing spiritually and logistically difficult, Gulag life did, for many, involve some form of literature, whether written or oral. Many prisoners also wrote about their experience in the camps after they were released. Access to books The quantity and type of literature available to Gulag prisoners was limited at best. Many camps did have libraries, but although a few contained impressive collections‚ÄîSolovetsky's, for example, at one point housed about 30,000 books‚Äîothers had meager and sometimes heavily censored offerings. Prisoners were often prohibited from having books of their own, especially ones with content that was seen as possibly anti-communist. Alexander Dolgun describes how the camp commandant would regularly visit his barracks and confiscate poetry books or books discussing religion. Prisoners did occasionally manage to conceal books, as in the case of a woman who lent Gustav Herling a copy of Fyodor Dostoyevsky‚Äôs The House of the Dead. But while some prisoners plotted to sneak illicit reading material into the camps, others resisted even the literature the Gulag administration offered. Uneducated inmates often found scholarly pursuits like reading to be too strenuous in addition to everything else they had to endure. Officials who tried to teach illiterate prisoners would fail because the task of learning to read was too taxing for men and women already coping with starvation and exhaustion. Prisoner-produced publications Cut off from the outside world, some camps put out their own newspapers and magazines. The earliest prisoners at Solovetsky took advantage of the monks‚Äô old lithography equipment at the camp to print several periodicals of their own, including the Solovetskie Ostrova (\\"Solovetsky Islands\\") and the Solovetskoi Lageram (\\"Solovetsky Camps\\"). They published cartoons; poetry and fiction, which often expressed prisoners‚Äô loneliness and longing for their families and homes; and scholarly articles, which covered topics ranging from local architecture to island wildlife to fur farming. This much journalistic freedom was unusual, however; in many other camps, newspapers were closely monitored or even produced by the administration, so that they contained mainly propaganda. Storytelling and recitation Even heavy censorship, though, could not smother many prisoners‚Äô creative spirit. Storytelling was a common pursuit among inmates, who would recount their experiences, tales of their own invention, or stories they recalled from books and movies. Alexander Dolgun once recited the plot of Les Mis√©rables to attentive listeners, and Janusz Bardach told the story of The Three Musketeers. Having an audience could pay off; inmates and officials alike would offer rewards in exchange for literary entertainment. Karol Colonna-Czosnowski was paid with food and tobacco by members of a gang of camp thieves for telling stories of the famous American gangsters Al Capone and John Dillinger. Leonid Finklestein was known for his skillful storytelling, and in return for his stories he was given special treatment‚Äîextra water breaks‚Äîby the brigadier leader. Many others describe how they were able to survive the camps mainly by entertaining the officials with stories and retellings of classic novels. Reciting poetry, original or memorized, was another common practice. Like storytelling, poetry recitation could yield material rewards from an appreciative audience. Eugenia Ginzburg received water from fellow inmates each time she recited a poem, as a reward for ‚Äúservice to the community.‚Äù Saying poems aloud could be a social activity and a bonding experience for prisoners; Ginzburg recalls reciting poetry with her cellmate Julia Karepova for six hours a day during one period. Aleksei Smirnov tells in his memoirs of two scholars who together fabricated a fictitious eighteenth-century French poet and wrote his made-up verses. For some prisoners, even the silent, private recollection of classic poetry was enough to make Gulag life tolerable: the writer Varlam Shalamov called poetry his ‚Äúsecret savior,‚Äù and Eugenia Ginzburg wrote in a poem of her own composition about the solace she found in reciting verses by Pushkin and Alexander Blok. Even in her cell, she wrote, she was ‚Äúnot alone‚Äù if she had poetry to keep her company. ‚ÄúThey had taken my dress, my shoes and stockings, and my comb,‚Äù she recalled, ‚Äú...but [poetry] it was not in their power to take away.‚Äù Exiled writers Just as many actors and artists were condemned to exile, a number of writers spent time in the Gulags as well. Circumstances in most camps made it difficult for these prisoners to continue writing: if the hard labor and brutal, dehumanizing conditions did not crush their creativity and motivation, the scarcity of materials like pen and paper posed logistical obstacles. Strictness varied from camp to camp, but physical writing was often prohibited, with the exception of the pro-Soviet jingles and captions the camp administration assigned some poets to compose. Private journaling was not favorably regarded. Anything Eugenia Ginzburg and her cellmate wrote, for example, had to be erased, because censors would confiscate their notebooks monthly. In many camps, prisoners who kept records or diaries could be punished if their notebooks were discovered. Still, many writers in the Gulag (and some prisoners who had not written prior to their exile) managed to compose prose and especially poetry, often memorizing it without ever actually committing it to paper. Ginzburg wrote verses expressing both her despair and the comfort poetry gave her; Janusz Bardach invented stories to keep himself occupied through the mind-numbing days. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn initially took notes on his experiences, but after they were destroyed he memorized his text using a complicated mnemonic process that involved laying out a configuration of matchstick fragments and rearranging them as he recited each line to himself. Literature inspired by the Gulag Many literary works have been published about the Gulag by former prisoners. Three of the most famous such Russian writers are Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Eugenia Ginzburg, and Varlam Shalamov. A Polish writer Gustaw Herling-Grudzi≈Ñski was liberated from a camp in 1941, left Soviet Union with Polish Armed Forces in the East and published his A World Apart in 1951. A number of ex-prisoners wrote memoirs describing their experiences in the camps, many of which have been translated into English.

He was made a cardinal in 2014. He previously served as Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops after more than twenty years in the diplomatic service of the Holy See that included stints as Apostolic Nuncio to Haiti, Paraguay, India, Nepal, and Brazil. Biography Baldisseri was born in Barga, in the province of Lucca, Italy, on 29 September 1940 and ordained on 29 June 1963. He studied at the Pontifical Lateran University and the University of Perugia from 1970 to 1973. He earned a doctorate in canon law, with a thesis entitled: \\"The Nunciature in Tuscany\\". To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1971. He then joined the diplomatic service of the Holy See and served in many areas of the world over the next two decades. On 15 January 1992, Pope John Paul II appointed him Titular Archbishop of Diocletiana and Apostolic Nuncio to Haiti. He was named Apostolic Nuncio to Paraguay on 6 April 1995. He then took up a pair of titles, Apostolic Nuncio to India on 19 June 1999 and Apostolic Nuncio to Nepal on 23 June 1999. He was appointed to his last diplomatic post as Brazil on 12 November 2002. Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops He was appointed secretary of the Congregation for Bishops on 11 January 2012. He served as secretary of the College of Cardinals from 7 March 2012 to 28 January 2014. In that role he served as secretary of the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. At the end of that conclave, Pope Francis gave Baldisseri his red zuchetto, a traditional sign that the new pope would soon make the secretary a cardinal. In January 2013, he reported on Pope Benedict XVI's meetings with the world's bishops. Known as ad limina visits, they are supposed to occur every five years. Baldisseri said that it had taken the Pope more than seven years to complete the full cycle. In early September 2013, Baldisseri was part of a group of 30 officials of the Roman Curia who met with Pope Francis to offer their views and concerns with respect to his proposed reorganization of the Vatican's administrative apparatus.  General Secretary of the Synod of Bishops Pope Francis named Baldisseri the General Secretary of the Synod of Bishops on 21 September 2013. His central responsibility was to organize the synod operations according to the pope's vision, \\"to radically revamp its working methods\\". In October 2013 Archbishop Baldisseri asked national bishops conferences around the world to conduct a wide-ranging poll of Catholics asking for their opinions on church teachings on contraception, same-sex marriage and divorce. Baldisseri asked the episcopal conferences to distribute the poll \\"immediately as widely as possible to deaneries and parishes so that input from local sources can be received.\\" The poll, which comes in a questionnaire sent to national bishops' conferences globally in preparation for a Vatican synod on the family next October, was the first time the church's central hierarchy has asked for such input from grass-roots Catholics since the establishment of the synod system following the Second Vatican Council. In a May 2014 newspaper interview, Baldisseri said it was time to update Church doctrine in connection with divorce and people who are in civil partnerships: \\"The Church is not timeless, she lives amidst the vicissitudes of history and the Gospel must be known and experienced by people today,\\" Cardinal Baldisseri says. \\"It is in the present that the message should be, with all respect for the integrity from whom the message has been received. We now have two synods to treat this complex theme of the family and I believe that these dynamics in two movements will allow a more adequate response to the expectations of the people\\". In an interview Cardinal Baldisseri said that the structure of the upcoming extraordinary Synod of Bishops on the family will be shorter than a usual synod and will include new rules aimed at helping the bishops really grapple with the issues together, said the general secretary of the synod. \\"We want a frank, open, civilized discussion,\\".Changes in synod process designed to increase discussion, cardinal says Along with Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, Baldisseri served as the public voice of the synod, explaining its procedures and the ways its format departed from those of previous synods. The topics raised in the questionnaire included contraception, divorce and remarriage, same-sex marriage, premarital sex and in vitro fertilization. Some responses questioned the church's teaching or encouraged greater understanding of people who cannot always live up to that teaching. Cardinal Baldisseri said that the bishops \\"must recognize that the faithful perceive the truth\\" about the Gospel and its values and their input cannot be ignored. \\"But the bishops have the responsibility and authority to discern ways to apply the constant teaching of the church,\\" he said. The big change from past synods is that the voting members of the extraordinary synod will be asked to submit their presentations in writing at least two weeks before the meeting opens, the cardinal said.\\"This is not to limit the discussion, but to help organize it\\". The report opening the synod, which used to be a rephrasing of the synod working document, now will be a first summary of the bishops' submissions, he said. At a 3 October 2014 press conference, when asked how the Synod on the Family would address the topic of divorced and remarried Catholics, he said \\"The Synod is about family, not divorce. Let's not monopolize it with Western problems. We need to present the beauty of the family to the world\\" and \\"we want to walk and view the global challenges to find an answer in the light of the Gospel\\". He served as the synod's general secretary. Cardinal Pope Francis raised Baldisseri to the rank of Cardinal-Deacon on 22 February 2014 and assigned him to the Sant‚ÄôAnselmo all'Aventino. In December 2013 he was appointed as a member of the Congregation for Bishops and that appointment was confirmed in May 2014 after he became a cardinal. On 13 September 2014 he was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. Pope Francis appointed Mario Grech Pro-Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops on 2 October 2019 to serve in anticipation of Baldisseri's retirement. Pope Francis accepted Baldisseri's resignation on 15 September 2020.

Otto III then ruled alone, until his death, the following year. The reign of these two Ascanian margraves was characterized by an expansion of the margraviate, which annexed the remaining parts of Teltow and Barnim, the Uckermark, the Lordship of Stargard, the Lubusz Land and parts of the Neumark east of the Oder. They consolidated the position of Brandenburg within the Holy Roman Empire, which was reflected in the fact that in 1256, Otto III was a candidate to be elected King of the Germans. They founded several cities and developed the twin cities of C√∂lln and Berlin. They expanded the Ascanian castle in nearby Spandau and made it their preferred residence. Before their death, they divided the margraviate in a Johannine and an Ottonian part. The Ascanians were traditionally buried in the Lehnin Abbey in the Ottonian part of the country. In 1258, they founded a Cistercian monastery named Mariensee, where members of the Johannine line could be buried. In 1266, they changed their mind and founded a second monastery, named Chorin, 8 km southwest of Mariensee. John was initially buried at Mariensee; his body was moved to Chorin in 1273. After the Ottonian line died out in 1317, John I's grandson Waldemar reunited the margraviate. Life  Regency and guardianship  Otto was the younger son of Albert II of the Brandenburg line of the House of Ascania and Mechthild (Matilda) of Lusatia, daughter of Count Conrad II of Lusatia, a junior line of the House of Wettin. Since both Otto and his two-year older brother John I were minors when their father died in 1220, Emperor Frederick II transferred the regency to Archbishop Albert I of Magdeburg. The guardianship was taken up by the children's first cousin once removed, Count Henry I of Anhalt, the older brother of Duke Albert I of Saxony, a cousin of Albert II. As the sons of Duke Bernard III of Saxony, they were the closest relatives, and Henry had the older rights. In 1221, their mother, Countess Matilda, purchased the regency from the Archbishop of Magdeburg for 1900 silver Marks and then ruled jointly with Hernry I.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., p. 62 The Archbishop of Magdeburg then traveled to Italy, to visit Emperor Frederick II and Duke Albert I of Saxony attempted to grab power in Brandenburg, causing a rift with his brother Henry I. The Saxon attack presented an opportunity for Count Palatine Henry V to get involved. Emperor Frederick II managed to prevent a feud, urging them to keep the peace. After Matilda died in 1225, the brothers ruled the Margraviate of Brandenburg jointly. John I was about twelve years old at the time, and Otto III was ten. They were knighted on 11 May 1231 in Brandenburg an der Havel and this is generally taken as the beginning of their reign.brandenburg1260.de Marca BrandenburgensisLyon 2013, pp. 203  Domestic policies  Deed of John I, raising Frankfurt an der Oder (Vrankenvorde) to city status in 1253 After the death of Count Henry of Brunswick-L√ºneburg in 1227, the brothers supported his nephew, their brother- in-law Otto the Child, who was only able to prevail against Hohenstaufen claims and its vassals by force of arms. In 1229, there was a feud with former regent Archbishop Albert, which ended peacefully. Like their former opponents and defenders, they appeared at the Diet of Mainz in 1235, where the Public Peace of Mainz was proclaimed. After the dispute over the kingship between Conrad IV and Henry Raspe the brothers recognized William II of Holland as king in 1251. They first exercised Brandenburg's electoral privilege in 1257, when they voted for king Alfonso X of Castile. Although Alfonso was not elected, the fact that they were able to vote illustrates the growing importance of Brandenburg, which had been founded only a century earlier, in 1157, by Albert the Bear. When John and Otto came to power, Brandenburg was considered an insignificant little principality on the eastern border. By the 1230s, the Margraves of Brandenburg had definitely gained the heritable post of Imperial Chamberlain and the indisputable right to vote in the election of the King of the Germans.Lutz Partenheimer: Albrecht der B√§r ..., p. 195  Developing the country  John I and his brother Otto III developed the territory of their margraviate and expanded market towns and castles, including Spandau, C√∂lln and Prenzlau into towns and centers of commerce. They also expanded Frankfurt an der Oder and John I awarded it city status in 1253.  The Teltow War and the Treaty of Landin  Between 1230 and 1245, Brandenburg acquired the remaining part of Barnim and the southern Uckermark up to the Welse river. On 20 June 1236, the Margraviate acquired the Lordships of Stargard, Beseritz and Wustrow by the Treaty of Kremmen from Duke Wartislaw III of Pomerania. Later that year, the brothers initiated the construction of Stargard Castle, to secure the northernmost part of their territory. From 1239 to 1245, the brothers fought the Teltow War against the Margraves of Meissen of the House of Wettin. At stake was a Slavic castle at K√∂penick, a former headquarters of the Sprewanen tribe, located at the confluence of the Spree and Dahme rivers, at the time, it was just east of Berlin; today it's part of the city. It dominated the Barnim and Teltow areas. In 1245, the brothers managed to take both castle a K√∂penick and a fortress at Mittenwalde. From this base, they could expand further to the east. In 1249, they acquired the Lubusz Land and reached the river Oder. Towns on the Teltow and Barnim plateaus, around 1250 The Ascanian Margraviate of Brandenburg, around 1320 In 1250, the brothers closed the Treaty of Landin with the Dukes of Pomerania. Under this treaty, they received the northern part of the Uckermark (), north of the Welse river and the districts of Randow and L√∂cknitz, in exchange for the half of the Lordship of Wolgast that John I had received as dowry from King Waldemar II of Denmark when he married his first wife, Sophia. This treaty is considered the birth of the Uckermark as a part of Brandenburg.Uwe Michas: Die Eroberung und Besiedlung ..., p. 41 Otto joined King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1255 in the Prussian Crusade, and helped establish K√∂nigsberg.  Policies to stabilize the Neumark  During the first third of the 13th century German settlers were recruited by Duke Leszek I the White to settle the Neumark. After he died in 1227, the Polish central government collapsed, allowing the Margraves of Brandenburg to expand eastwards. They acquired land east of the Oder and expanded their domain further east to the river Drawa and north to the river Persante. In 1257, John I founded the town of Landsberg (now called as an alternative river crossing across the Warta, competing with the crossing in the Polish town of Santok, detracting from the considerable revenues Santok made from foreign trade (custom duties, fees from the market operation and storage fees), similar to the way Berlin had been founded to compete with K√∂penick. In 1261, the Margraves purchased My≈õlib√≥rz () from the Knights Templar and began developing the town to their power center in the Neumark. To stabilize their new possessions, the Margraves used the tried and tested Ascanian policy of founding monasteries and settlements. As early as 1230, they supported the Polish Count Dionysius Bronisius when he founded the Cistercian Paradies Monastery near Miƒôdzyrzecz () as a filiation of the monastery at Lehnin. Their cooperation with the Polish count provided border security against Pomerania and prepared the economy of the area for integration into the Neumark. Among the settlers in the Neumark was the von Sydow family, who were later ennobled. the small town of Cedynia (; today in the Polish Voivodeship of West Pomerania) was enfoeffed to the noble von Jagow family. The historian Stefan Warnatsch has summarized this development and the attempts of the Ascanians to gain access to the Baltic Sea from the middle Oder and the Uckermark as follows: The great success of the territorial expansion in the 13th century was largely due to the great-grandsons of Albert the Bear [...]. The design of their reign reached much further spatially and conceptually then that of their predecessors.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., p. 26 According to Lutz Partenheimer: [around 1250], the Ascanians had pushed back their competitors from Magdeburg, Wettin, Mecklenburg, Pomerania, Poland and the smaller competitors on all fronts. However, John I and Otto III failed to produce the strategically important connection to the Baltic Sea.  Development in the Berlin area  The development of the Berlin area is closely related to the other policies of the two Margraves. The two founding cities of Berlin (C√∂lln and Berlin) were founded relatively late. The settlements began around 1170 and achieved city status around 1240.Wolfgang Fritze: Gr√ºndungsstadt Berlin. Die Anfange von Berlin-C√∂lln als Forschungsproblem, Potsdam, 2000 Other settlement in the area, such as Spandau and K√∂penick, date back to the Slavic period (from about 720) and these naturally had a greater strategic and political importance than the young merchant towns C√∂lln and Berlin. For a long time the border between the territories of the Slavic tribes Hevelli and Sprewanen crossed straight through the area of today's Berlin. Around 1130, Spandau was an eastern outpost of the Hevelli under Pribislav. When Pribilav died in 1150, Spandau fell to Brandenburg under the terms of an inheritance treaty between Pribislav and Albert the Bear. Brandenburg did not acquire K√∂penick until 1245.  Residence at Spandau  Plauer See, the scene of a battle against Magdeburg in 1229 In 1229, the Margraves of Brandenburg lost a battle against their former guardian, the archbishop of Magdeburg at the Plauer See, close to their residence in Brandenburg an der Havel. They escaped to the fortress at Spandau. In the following years, the brothers made Spandau their preferred residence, next to Tangerm√ºnde in the Altmark. Between 1232 and 1266, seventeen stays at Spandau have been documented, more than at any other town.Felix Escher: Der Wandel der Residenzfunktion. ..., p. 161 Albert the Bear probably expanded the fortress island at Spandau eastwards before or shortly after his victory against a certain Jaxa (this was probably Jaxa of K√∂penick) in 1157. Towards the end of the 12th century, the Ascanians moved the fortress about a kilometer to the North, to the location of today's Spandau Citadel, probably because of a rising ground water table. The presence of an Ascanian fortress on this site in 1197 has been established.Winfried Schich: Die Entstehung der mittelalterlichen Stadt Spandau. ..., p. 63f John I and Otto III expanded the fortress and promoted the civitas in the adjacent settlement. They gave it city rights in 1232 or earlier. They founded the Benedictine nunnery of St. Mary in 1239. The Nonnendammallee, one of the oldest streets in Berlin and as Nonnendamm part of a trade route as early as the 13th century, is still a reminder of the former nunneryNonnendammallee, in: Stra√üennamenlexikon des Luisenst√§dtischen Bildungsvereins  Expansion of C√∂lln and Berlin  John I (sitting) and Otto III studying the (alleged) city charter of Berlin and C√∂lln (now in the Spandau Citadel). Berlin and C√∂lln around 1230 St. Nicholas Church in Berlin, founded around 1220/1230, picture from 1740 According to the current state of research, no evidence has been found that a Slavic settlement existed in the area around the twin towns of Berlin and C√∂lln.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... S. 151 The ford across the largely swampy Berlin Glacial Valley gained importance during the Slavic-German transition period, when John I and Otto III settled the sparsely populated plateaus of Teltow and Barnim with local Slavs and German immigrants. According to Adriaan von M√ºller, the strategic importance of C√∂lln and Berlin, and the reason for the foundation was probably to form a counterweight to K√∂penick, a secure trading hub held by the Wettin (dynasty)s with its own trade routes to the north and east. The broad ford across two or even three river arms away could best be protected by fortified settlements on both river banks. The Margraves protected the route to Halle across the northwestern Teltow plateau by a chain of Templar villages: Marienfelde, Mariendorf, Rixdorf and Tempelhof. After the Ascanians defeated the Wettins in the Teltow War of 1245, the importance of K√∂penick decreased, took an increasingly central position in the developing trading network.Adriaan von M√ºller: Gesicherte Spuren ..., p. 114f According to Winfried Schich, we can assume the Berlin and C√∂lln owe their development as urban settlements to the structural changes in this area due to the expansion during the High Middle Ages, which led both to a denser population and a reorganization of long- distance trade routes. [...] The dilluvial plateaus of Teltow and Barnim with their heavy and relatively fertile soils, were systematically settled and put under the plow during the reign of Margraves John I and Otto III.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... p. 157. During the first phase of settlement, the lowland areas along the river with their lighter soils seem to have been the preferred places of settlement. According to the of 1280, Berlin and other places were built' () by John I and Otto III. Since their reign had started in 1225, the period around 1230 is considered the founding period of Berlin. Recent archaeological research has uncovered evidence of late 12th century market towns in both C√∂lln and Berlin. Ninety graves were excavated in the St. Nicholas Church, the oldest building in Berlin, with foundations dated 1220-1230 and some of these graves could also be from the late 12th century. This implies that the two Margraves did not actually found the cities of C√∂lln and Berlin, although they did play a decisive role in the early expansion of the cities.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... p. 142 ff and 159 Among the privileges granted to the two cities by the Margraves were Brandenburg Law (including absence of tolls, free exercise of trade and commerce, hereditary property rights) and in particular the staple right,According to Stich, the deed from 1298 in which Margrave Otto V confirmed the staple right granted by his father and uncle, was at least partially forged on a later date. Nevertheless, the staple right may have been granted by John I and Otto III which gave C√∂lln and Berlin an economic advantage of Spandau and K√∂penick. The Margraves gave the Mirica, the C√∂lln Moor, with all usage rights to the citizens of C√∂lln. The connection of the Margraves with Berlin is also evidenced by their choice of Hermann von Langele as their confessor. This Hermann von Langele was the first known member of the Franciscan convent at Berlin. He is mentioned as a witness in a deed issued by the Margrave in Spandau in 1257.Winfried Schich: Die Entstehung der mittelalterlichen Stadt Spandau. ..., p. 83  Otto's death  Otto III died on 9 October 1267 at his residence in Brandenburg an der Havel. Although the traditional Ascanian grave site at Lehnin Abbey was situated in his half of the Margraviate, he preferred to be buried in the church of the Dominican monastery in Strausberg he had founded in 1252. The Ascanians had neglected Lehnin Abbey with regards to gifts and donations since the regency of their mother, who was probably not very close to the Abbey on the Zauche plateau. The town where Otto III was buried: Strausberg, at the banks of lake Straussee The historian Otto Tschirch writes about Otto's death: [...] Otto III's preferred residence, apart from the castle on the cathedral island, appears to have been the margrave's court in the New Town (i.e. west of the river) in Brandenburg an der Havel, on the spot where later the St. Pauli Monastery was built. He met his death here, a few months after his older brother John, who died in the second half of 1266. After he had attended Sunday mass, he died in the presence of numerous Dominican friars. for whom he had a special fondness. This is why the court was later donated to the Dominican Order, who built a monastery on this spot. His wife, Beatrice of Bohemia, and his two older sons, John III and Otto V, brought his body to Strausberg, where he was buried in the choir of the Dominican church he had founded, according to his solemn last wishesOtto Tschirch: History ...., vol. 1, p. 50  Inheritance and descendants  The joint rule of the Margraves ended in 1258 with a division of their territory. A cleverly managed division and continued consensual policy prevented the Margraviate from falling apart. The preparations for the reorganization may have begun in 1250, when the Uckermark was acquired, but no later than 1255, when John I married Jutta (Brigitte), the daughter of Duke Albert I of Saxony-Wittenberg.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., S. 64f  Johannine and Ottonian line   Chorin Abbey - Grave laying and power politics  Chorin Abbey, burial place of John I Chorin Abbey church Chorin Abbey, founded by John I and Otto III, north side, 1854 The politics of marriage and 1258 consummated division of the state government led to the joint foundation of the monastery of Mariensee on a former island in the Parsteiner See lake on the northeastern edge of today's Barnim. Until then, deceased Margraves of Brandenburg had been buried at Lehnin Abbey, in the Ottonian part of the Margraviate. The monastery of Mariensee was meant to provide the Johannine line with a burial place of their own. Construction of the monastery began in 1258 with monks from Lehnin. Even before Mariensee was completed in 1273, a decision was made to move to a new location approximately five miles to the southwest with the new name Chorin Abbey. When John I died in 1266, he was initially buried at Mariensee. In 1273, his body was moved to Chorin Abbey.Harald Schwillus and Stefan Beier: Zisterzienser zwischen ..., p. 11, 16 It appears that in 1266, John I arranged for the monastery to move and that he donated rich gifts to the new Chorin Abbey, including the village of Parstein. His sons later confirmed these donations for the benefit of their father's soul and their own.Wolfgang Erdmann: Zisterzienser-Abtei Chorin. ..., p. 10 As with all monasteries founded by the Ascanians, political and economic considerations played an important r√¥le, alongside the pastoral aspects. A Slavic circular rampart existed on the island, to the west of the monastery. John I and Otto III probably used this rampart as a castle against their Pomeranian competitors. The monastery was meant to provide central and administrative functions. \\"Both the foundation itself and the location in a regional centre 'across' the trade route [...] in a populated area are to be interpreted as the result of political calculations\\".Wolfgang Erdmann: Zisterzienser-Abtei Chorin. ..., S. 7  Dividing the Margraviate  When the Margraviate was divided, John I received Stendal and the Altmark, which was considered the \\"cradle\\" of Brandenburg, and would remain a part until 1806. He also received the Havelland and the Uckermark. His brother Otto III received Spandau, Salzwedel, Barnim, the Lubusz Land and Stargard.Sources do not entirely agree on who received what. For example Marca Brandenburgensis says that The elder (Ottonian) line received the Stendal area in the Altmark, the Havelland, Teltow, Barnim, parts of the Neumark and the cities of Brandenburg an der Havel (Altstadt, i.e. the part north of the river), Berlin and Spandau The most important factors in this division were revenue and the number of vassals; geographical factors played only a subordinate r√¥le.Uwe Michas: Die Eroberung und Besiedlung ..., p. 58 Their successors as Margraves of Brandenburg, Otto IV \\"with the Arrow\\", Waldemar \\"the Great\\" and Henry II \\"the Child\\" all stem from the Johannine line. Otto's sons and grandsons and John's younger sons also styled themselves \\"Margrave of Brandenburg\\" and as such co-signed official document -- for example, John's sons John II and Conrad so-signed in 1273 the decision to move Mariensee monastery to Chorin -- however, they remained \\"co-regents\\". The Ottonian line died out in 1317 with the death of Margrave John V in Spandau, so that Brandenburg was reunited under Waldemar the Great. The Johannine line died out only three years later, with the death of Henry the Child in 1320, ending Ascanian rule in Brandenburg. In 1290, nineteen Margraves of the two lines had gathered on a hill near Rathenow; in 1318 only two Margraves were left alive: Waldemar and Henry the Child.Stefan Warnatsch: Geschichte des Klosters Lehnin ..., p. 66 The last Ascanian in Brandenburg, the eleven-year-old Henry the Child, only played a minor r√¥le and was already at the mercy of the various houses trying to grab power in the upcoming power vacuum.  Marriage and issue  In 1244, Otto III married Beatrix (), a daughter of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia.Jonathan R. Lyon, Princely Brothers and Sisters: The Sibling Bond in German Politics, 1100-1250, (Cornell University Press, 2013), 241. Upper Lusatia came to Brandenburg via this marriage. They had the following children: * John III \\"of Prague\\" (1244‚Äì1268) * Otto V \\"the Tall\\" (-1298)John I had a son known as Otto IV, which is why this numeral was skipped in the Ottonian line * Albert III (-1300) * Otto VI \\"the Short\\" (-1303) * Kunigunde (died ), married: : in 1264 to Duke Bela of Slavonia (1245-1269) : in 1273 to Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg * Matilda (d. 1316), married in 1266 to Duke Barnim I of Pomerania (-1278)  Double statue of the brothers at the Siegesallee  Siegesallee in Berlin with double statue for the Margraves John I and Otto III. The left side figure is the priest Simeon from C√∂lln, the figure on the right is Marsilius de Berlin. Sculptor: Max Baumbach, unveiled in 1900 The double statue depicted on the left stood in the Siegesallee in the Gro√üer Tiergarten in Berlin. The Siegesallee was a grand boulevard commissioned by Emperor Wilhelm II in 1895 with statues illustrating the history of Brandenburg and Prussia. Between 1895 and 1901, 27 sculptors led by Reinhold Begas created 32 statues of Prussian and Brandenburg rulers, each 2.75 high. Each statue was flanked by two smaller busts representing people who had played an important r√¥le in the life of the historic ruler. The central statue in group 5 was the double statue of John and Otto. On the left was a bust of provost Simeon of C√∂lln, who was a witness, on 28 October 1237, together with bishop Gernand of Brandenburg, of the oldest deed in which C√∂lln is mentioned.28\\\\. Oktober (year 1237) in: Tagesfakten by the Luisenst√§dtischer Bildungsverein On the right was a bust of Marsilius de Berlin, the first recorded mayor () of Berlin. He was simultaneously mayor of C√∂lln.Winfried Schich: Das mittelalterliche Berlin, ... p. 141. The choice of the secular and ecclesiastical leaders of Berlin and C√∂lln as flanking characters for John and Otto underscores the pivotal r√¥le the city of Berlin played in the lives of the Margraves in the opinion of Reinhold Koser, the historian who did the research for the Siegesallee. Koser regarded the founding and development of the city as the Margrave's most important policy, more so than the expansion the principality and the founding of the monastery. he was also impressed by the consensus which characterised their joint rule, as presented in the Chronicle of 1280. According to Koser, the sculptor Max Baumbach was responsible for the decision to make the founding of Berlin the central theme of the double statue, rather than the expansion or the founding of the monastery. John I depicted sitting on a stone, with the city charter of Berlin and C√∂lln spread across his knees. The younger Otto III stand beside him, pointing to the deed with one hand, while his other arm rests on a spear. The outstretched arms and bowed head suggest the brothers' protection and promotion of the twin cities. The fact that the two young men are depicted as mature men was seen by Koser as legitimized by the right of artistic freedom. Two adolescents would not have been able to adequately express the founding of a future world city, from the perspective of the late 19th century interpretation of history.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und ..., p. 115 The overall architecture of the statue group maintains a romanticistic style. According to Uta Lehnert, the two eagles show characteristics of the Jugendstil. Ancestry  References   Primary references  * Heinrici de Antwerpe: Can.

Mets  Saul Katz first bought an ownership stake in the New York Mets in 1980. In addition, he serves as the President of the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Mets minor league affiliate. In 2014, Katz was rumored to be interested in selling his ownership stake in the Mets. In 2020, a deal to sell the team to hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen fell through over issues of team control. A similar deal with David Einhorn fell through in 2011. In February 2020, it was reported that Katz and his partners were willing to sell the team without maintaining control.

This era included various changing governments and US military occupations, and ended with the success of the Cuban Revolution in 1959. During this period, the United States exerted great influence on Cuban politics, notably through the Platt Amendment. The governments of Cuba have been regarded as client states of the United States. From 1902 to 1932 Cuban and United States law included the Platt Amendment, which guaranteed the US right to intervene in Cuba and placed restrictions on Cuban foreign relations. In 1934, Cuba and the United States signed the Treaty of Relations in which Cuba was obligated to give preferential treatment of its economy to the United States, in exchange the United States gave Cuba a guaranteed 22 percent share of the US sugar market that later was amended to a 49 percent share in 1949. In the modern Republic of Cuba, the 1902 to 1959 period is known as the Neocolonial Republic (), while Cuban exiles refer to it as Free Cuba (). 1902-1933: Early governments Raising the Cuban flag on the Governor General's Palace at noon on May 20, 1902. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Spain and the United States signed the 1898 Treaty of Paris, by which Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the United States for the sum of $20million (equivalent to $million in ). Cuba gained formal independence from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, as the Republic of Cuba. Under Cuba's new constitution, the U.S. retained the right to intervene in Cuban affairs and to supervise its finances and foreign relations. Under the Platt Amendment, the U.S. leased the Guant√°namo Bay naval base from Cuba.  US occupation, 1906‚Äì1908  Following political purging and a corrupt and rigged election in 1906, the first president, Tom√°s Estrada Palma, faced an armed revolt by veterans of the war. As in the independence war, Afro-Cubans were overrepresented in the insurgent army of 1906. For them, the August Revolution revived hopes for a 'rightful share' in Cuba's government. On August 16, 1906, fearing the government ready to smash the plot, former Liberation Army general Pino Guerra raised the banner of revolt. Immediately Palma arrested every Liberal politician in reach; the remainder went underground. In an effort to avert intervention Roosevelt sent two emissaries to Havana to seek a compromise between government and opposition. Regarding such impartiality as a vote of censure on his government, Estrada Palma resigned and made his entire cabinet resign too, leaving the Republic without a government and forcing the United States to take control of the island. Roosevelt immediately proclaimed that the USA had been compelled to intervene in Cuba and that their only purpose was to create the necessary conditions for a peaceful election.https://libraries.ucsd.edu/research-and- collections/collections/notable-collections/latin-american-elections- statistics/Cuba/elections-and-events-19021911.html  1908‚Äì1924  In 1908, self-government was restored when Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez was elected president, but the U.S. continued intervening in Cuban affairs. In 1912, the Partido Independiente de Color attempted to establish a separate black republic in Oriente Province, but was suppressed by General Monteagudo with considerable bloodshed. Sugar production played an important role in Cuban politics and economics. In the 1910s, during and after World War I, a shortage in the world sugar supply fueled an economic boom in Cuba, marked by prosperity and the conversion of more and more farmland to sugar cultivation. Prices peaked and then crashed in 1920, ruining the country financially and allowing foreign investors to gain more power than they already had. This economic turbulence was called \\"the Dance of the Millions\\".Kevin Grogan, Cuba's Dance of the Millions: Examining the Causes and Consequences of Violent Price Fluctuations in the Sugar Market Between 1919 and 1920; Masters' Thesis accepted at University of Florida, August 2004.Ralph Lee Woodward, Jr., \\"Dance of the Millions\\"; Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2008).  Machado era  In 1924, Gerardo Machado was elected president. During his administration, tourism increased markedly, and American-owned hotels and restaurants were built to accommodate the influx of tourists. The tourist boom led to increases in gambling and prostitution in Cuba. Machado initially enjoyed support from much of the public and from all the country's major political parties. However, his popularity declined steadily. In 1928 he held an election which was to give him another term, this one of six years, despite his promise to serve only for one term. 1933-1958: Unrest and new governments Revolution of 1933 The Wall Street Crash of 1929 led to precipitous drops in the price of sugar, political unrest, and repression. Protesting students, known as the Generation of 1930, and a clandestine terrorist organization known as the ABC, turned to violence in opposition to the increasingly unpopular Machado. US ambassador Sumner Welles arrived in May 1933 and began a diplomatic campaign which involved \\"mediation\\" with opposition groups in including the ABC. This campaign significantly weakened Machado's government and, backed with the threat of military intervention, set the stage for a regime change.Philip Dur & Christopher Gilcrease, \\"U.S. Diplomacy and the Downfall of a Cuban Dictator: Machado in 1933\\"; Journal of Latin American Studies Vol. 34, No. 2, May 2002; DOI: 10.01/S0022216X02006417; JSTOR. A general strike (in which the Popular Socialist Party sided with Machado), uprisings among sugar workers, and an army revolt forced Machado into exile in August 1933. He was replaced by Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada, son of Cuban patriot Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes and former ambassador to the US. The Pentarchy of 1933. Fulgencio Batista, who controlled the armed forces, appears at far right. In September 1933, the Sergeants' Revolt, led by Sergeant Fulgencio Batista, overthrew C√©spedes. General Alberto Herrera served briefly as president (August 12‚Äì13) followed by Carlos Manuel de C√©spedes y Quesada from August 13 until September 5, 1933. A five-member executive committee (the Pentarchy of 1933) was chosen to head a provisional government. They were ousted by a student-led organization, the Student Directory, which appointed Ramon Grau San Martin as provisional president and passed various reforms during the ensuing One Hundred Days Government. Grau resigned in 1934, after which Batista dominated Cuban politics for the next 25 years, at first through a series of puppet-presidents. The period from 1933 to 1937 was a time of \\"virtually unremitting social and political warfare\\". Constitution of 1940 A new constitution was adopted in 1940, which engineered radical progressive ideas, including the right to labor and health care. Batista was elected president in the same year, holding the post until 1944. He is so far the only non-white Cuban to win the nation's highest political office. His government carried out major social reforms. Several members of the Communist Party held office under his administration. Cuban armed forces were not greatly involved in combat during World War II, although president Batista suggested a joint U.S.-Latin American assault on Francoist Spain in order to overthrow its authoritarian regime. Batista adhered to the 1940 constitution's strictures preventing his re-election. Ramon Grau San Martin was the winner of the next election, in 1944. Grau further corroded the base of the already teetering legitimacy of the Cuban political system, in particular by undermining the deeply flawed, though not entirely ineffectual, Congress and Supreme Court. Carlos Pr√≠o Socarr√°s, a prot√©g√© of Grau, became president in 1948. The two terms of the Aut√©ntico Party saw an influx of investment which fueled a boom and raised living standards for all segments of society and created a prosperous middle class in most urban areas. Batista dictatorship Slum (bohio) dwellings in Havana, Cuba in 1954, just outside Havana baseball stadium. In the background is advertising for a nearby casino. After running unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1952, Batista staged a coup. Back in power and receiving financial, military and logistical support from the United States government,[7][8] Batista suspended the 1940 Constitution and revoked most political liberties, including the right to strike. He outlawed the Cuban Communist Party in 1952. He then aligned with the wealthiest landowners who owned the largest sugar plantations, and presided over a stagnating economy that widened the gap between rich and poor Cubans.[9] Eventually it reached the point where most of the sugar industry was in U.S. hands, and foreigners owned 70% of the arable land.[10] As such, Batista's repressive government then began to systematically profit from the exploitation of Cuba's commercial interests, by negotiating lucrative relationships with both the American Mafia, who controlled the drug, gambling, and prostitution businesses in Havana, and with large U.S.-based multinational companies who were awarded lucrative contracts.[9][11] To quell the growing discontent amongst the populace‚Äîwhich was subsequently displayed through frequent student riots and demonstrations‚ÄîBatista established tighter censorship of the media, while also utilizing his Bureau for the Repression of Communist Activities secret police to carry out wide-scale violence, torture and public executions. These murders mounted in 1957, as socialism became more influential. Many people were killed, with estimates ranging from hundreds to about 20,000 people killed. [12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Cuba had Latin America's highest per capita consumption rates of meat, vegetables, cereals, automobiles, telephones and radios, though about one third of the population was considered poor and enjoyed relatively little of this consumption. In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards.. On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization. They were obtained in large measure \\"at the cost of the unemployed and the peasants\\", leading to disparities.. Between 1933 and 1958, Cuba extended economic regulations enormously, causing economic problems. Unemployment became a problem as graduates entering the workforce could not find jobs. The middle class, which was comparable to that of the United States, became increasingly dissatisfied with unemployment and political persecution. The labor unions supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958. Tourism Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the Caribbean. The influx was due in large part to Cuba's proximity to the United States, where restrictive prohibition on alcohol and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. Such tourism became Cuba's third largest source of foreign currency, behind the two dominant industries of sugar and tobacco. Cuban drinks such as the daiquiri and mojito became common in the United States during this time, after Prohibition was repealed. A combination of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the end of prohibition, and World War II severely dampened Cuba's tourist industry, and it wasn't until the 1950s that numbers began to return to the island in any significant force. During this period, American organized crime came to dominate the leisure and tourist industries, a modus operandi outlined at the infamous Havana Conference of 1946. By the mid-1950s Havana became one of the main markets and the favourite route for the narcotics trade to the United States. Despite this, tourist numbers grew steadily at a rate of 8% a year and Havana became known as \\"the Latin Las Vegas\\".History of Cuba written and compiled by J.A.

It is the last in a sequence of novels, chronologically started with The Eagle of the Ninth, loosely tracing a family of the Roman Empire, then Britain, and finally Norse-Britain, who inherit an emerald seal ring bearing the insignia of a dolphin. It takes place during the Norman Rule of Britain, and tells the story of resistance against the Norman Conquest in the Lake District and North West England. Like many Sutcliff novels, the story of the characters unfold against a background of multi- cultural conflict and change. Plot summary The story revolves around Frytha and Bjorn, a girl and a boy who have both been orphaned by the Norman conquest, and have sought refuge and been taken in by Jarl Buthar in his hidden Lakeland settlement by Buthar's Mere. The group is portrayed as Northmen settlers who have long established themselves in the area, and are resisting Norman advances into their country. They describe themselves as forming their shield ring up in the fells of Lakeland, as a form of Last Stand against the Norman invasion. The theme of this Shield Ring is developed throughout the story, an ultimately portrayed as an ethic of loyalty to one's group, even unto death. Bjorn is fostered to a Harp player, an old man who originally fought the Normans at Hastings, who refers to being part of that Shield Wall resisting William the Conqueror. The instrument becomes a key feature of the narrative, being a symbolic link to the indigenous Welsh and British peoples with whom the Norse of Lakeland have intermingled. Bjorn is seen as having the musical gift from his maternal Celtic forebears, and learns to play as he grows up. This links him back to the family of the emerald seal ring with the dolphin insignia, which he is given when he comes of age. Frytha is shown as being very close to Bjorn, as she adapts from her original Saxon upbringing to be part of the Norse settlement. The story develops with a paralleling to the epic of Beowulf, with Frytha making connections between events in their life and in the epic. The Northmen successfully fend off a series of Norman attempts to overrun Lakeland, but the story comes to its crux when Ranulf le Meschin leads the largest and seemingly final attack, coming down from Cockermouth. Bjorn is sent as a spy, under the guise of a traveling harper, to reconnoiter the enemy camp, and Frytha sneaks off to accompany him, referencing how even Beowulf had Wiglaf come to his aid when Beowulf faced his doom. They succeed in infiltrating the enemy camp, and gather much information, but are ultimately discovered when the emerald seal ring is recognized by a Norman knight who had previously had a life-and-death struggle with Bjorn. Bjorn is subjected to torture by fire, paralleling Beowulf's downfall to a firedrake, and successfully resists. The whole concept of the Shield Wall being a spirit of resistance and unity within the band is brought into direct focus during his ordeal. Bjorn and Frytha soon escape, and return to bring the needed news to their people. With this information, the Northmen mislead the Norman host into an annihilating ambush in Rannerdale. Although her own inimitable take on the story of Jarl Buthar's guerilla campaign and a final battle at Rannerdale between the Normans and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cumbrians led by the Jarl, Sutcliff's novel was clearly inspired by the dramatized history written by Lakeland historian Nicholas Size, called \\"The Secret Valley: The Real Romance of Unconquered Lakeland\\" (pub. 1930) Being the second novel written in the series of eight novels about the evolution of a British bloodline throughout the ages, it is the last in chronological order. It closes with the characters facing a world of change and persevering in their loyalty to their culture and to each other.

They speak Kƒ´mbeere language, which is a dialect very similar to the one spoken by their neighbours, the Embu and Kikuyu. Mbeere hosts the famous seven folks dams, which include: Masinga dam, Kamburu dam, Gitaru dam, Kindaruma dam and Kiambere dam. The dams are a part of Tana River. Other local places of interest include the Mwea National Reserve, and Kiangombe mountain, which peaked at 1804 metres stands out compared to adjacent topography, although is not as spectacular as the Mount Kenya located less than 100 kilometres northwest.

Like the closely related Kikuyu, Embu, Meru and Kamba, they are concentrated in the vicinity of Mount Kenya. The exact place that the Mbeere's ancestors migrated from after the initial Bantu expansion from West Africa is uncertain. Some authorities suggest that they arrived in their present Mount Kenya area of in habitation from earlier settlements further to the north and east, while others argue that the Mbeere, along with the closely related Eastern Bantu people the Kikuyu, Embu, Meru and Kamba moved into Kenya from points further south.Arnold Curtis, Kenya: a visitor's guide, (Evans Brothers: 1985), p.7.

In a career that lasted from April 1850 to October 1853 he ran eighteen times and won ten races. Teddington won important races in each of his four seasons, most notably the Derby in 1851. In the next two years he proved himself to be a formidable stayer who excelled at distances in excess of two miles, winning the Doncaster Cup in 1852 and the Emperor of Russia's Plate in 1853. He was regarded by British experts as one of the best racehorses of his era. Teddington was retired to stud at the end of the 1853 season where he had limited success before being exported to Hungary in 1862. Background Teddington was a light yellow-chestnut horse standing just over 15 hands high with a white blaze and two white socks. He was described as having an \\"expressive, blood-like head\\" and a particularly fine action, but being otherwise an unimpressive specimen. He had a slight deformity of one of his front feet which was described as \\"clubby\\" and needed to be corrected with specially made shoes. He was bred by Jack Tomlinson, a Huntingdon blacksmith, and bought for 250 guineas as a foal by Sir Joseph Hawley. Hawley, who owned the colt in partnership with John Massey Stanley, sent him into training with his private trainer Alec Taylor Sr. at Fyfield, Hampshire. Teddington was the first Classic winner to be sired by Orlando, the winner of the controversial 1844 Derby. At stud Orlando also sired the 2000 Guineas winners Fitz-Roland, Diophantus and Fazzoletto as well as Eclipse, through whom his sire line was successful in the United States. Racing career 1850: two-year-old season Teddington was not an easy horse to manage, so that Taylor had to ride him personally in his early training gallops. When the colt easily defeated a horse named Slang, who was a year older, in a private trial race in March 1850, it was clear that he had considerable ability. Teddington made his racecourse debut in spring when he finished unplaced in a Sweepstakes at Newmarket and then ran third to Marlborough Buck in the Woodcote Stakes at Epsom. In July, he recorded his first win when taking the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket from eight opponents. At Goodwood later in the month he finished third to Phlegra in the Eglington Stakes and then won a two-runner race for the Molecomb Stakes on the following day. 1851: three-year-old season Teddington depicted in an etching by Charles Hunt On his first appearance as a three-year-old, Teddington won a Sweepstakes at Newmarket in April. More significant, however, was a private trial race at Fyfield in which he gave six pounds and a beating to Vatican, a five-year-old who had finished third in the 1849 St Leger. His preparation for the Derby was interrupted shortly afterwards however, as he sustained a leg injury which became infected and restricted his training. The injury responded to treatment, but when moved to Epsom he lost his appetite and would only \\"pick the split peas from a little corn\\" in the final build-up to the Derby. At Epsom on 21 May Teddington started the 3/1 favourite for the Derby in a field of thirty-three runners. Marlborough Buck was second favourite on 7/2 with the 2000 Guineas winner Hernandez the 7/1 third choice. Ridden by Job Marson, Teddington tracked the leaders before moving into the lead \\"with a decided leap\\" after half a mile. From that point on he appeared to be in complete command of the race and after being briefly challenged in the straight he pulled clear to win easily (\\"in a canter\\") by two lengths from Marlborough Buck. He was sent to Doncaster in September, but did not contest the St Leger, instead walking over in Don Stakes. On 16 October he ran against Mountain Deer in a ¬£1,000 match race at level weights over ten furlongs at Newmarket. Teddington held a narrow lead from the start, but Mountain Deer launched a strong challenge to move up nearly level inside the final furlong. Marson was forced to resort to using his whip and spurs and Teddington responded \\"gallantly\\" to win by half a length. Together with the match between The Flying Dutchman and Voltigeur in spring, the race was credited with renewing an interest in match races in Britain. His winnings of ¬£7,165 made him the highest earner of the British season. 1852: four-year-old season On 25 March 1852, Teddington ran fourth, attempting to give sixty-four pounds to a three-year-old called Poodle, in the two mile Northamptonshire Stakes and then ran a close third in the Newmarket Handicap on 13 April, conceding forty-seven pounds to the winner. At Goodwood he finished third to the three-year-olds Kingston (receiving twenty-five pounds) and Little Harry (receiving thirty-two pounds) in the Goodwood Cup, beaten half a length and three quarters of a length after a \\"fine race\\". He and then walked over for a ¬£200 prize later in the meeting. Teddington returned to winning form to take Warwick Cup on 8 September at Warwick where he started 11/10 favourite against three opponents. Ridden by Nat Flatman he won by a head from Little Harry to whom he was conceding thirty-two pounds. On his final start of the year he met Kingston again in the Doncaster Cup. On this occasion he was set to concede nineteen pounds to the three-year-old and the race appeared to be a virtual match, with the other runners largely ignored in the betting. As expected, Teddington and Kingston dominated the closing stages and after a \\"beautiful race\\" it was Teddington who prevailed by a neck. 1853: five-year-old season On his first run as a five-year-old, Teddington ran in the Emperor of Russia's Plate at Ascot. His main rival was the four-year-old Stockwell, the winner of the 2000 Guineas and St Leger, to whom he was conceding nine pounds. The race on the Thursday of the Royal Meeting attracted a huge crowd including Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. Teddington was held up towards the rear of the seven horse field before making steady progress to move into second place in the straight. In the final furlong Marson finally produced Teddington's challenge and he overtook Stockwell with a \\"tremendous burst of speed\\" to go a length clear. The last strides proved dramatic as Teddington abruptly swerved to the left and lost ground before Marson straightened him up to win by a head. Teddington's success was a very popular one, and he returned to the winner's enclosure to receive a reception the like of which had \\"seldom echoed round Ascot Heath.\\" The race was the last under that name: the outbreak of the Crimean War resulted in the event being run in future as the Ascot Gold Cup. 11 October at Newmarket he contested the Cesarewitch Handicap for which he was assigned top weight of 133 pounds. He finished unplaced behind Haco, a three- year-old carrying 82 pounds. Later that afternoon he appeared in The Whip, a challenge race over four miles in which he carried 140 pounds and finished second, beaten six lengths by Kingston in what proved to be his final appearance. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Teddington was ranked twentieth, having been placed in the top ten by thirteen of the contributors. He was the third highest-rated Derby winner of the 1850s behind West Australian and Thormanby. Stud career Teddington was not a great success a stallion, but he did sire Mayonnaise, the winner of the 1859 1000 Guineas. He is present in the pedigrees of modern Thoroughbred through his daughter Marigold, who produced Doncaster, a Derby winner who became an important sire. Teddington was sold for ¬£1,700 in 1861 and exported to Austria Hungary. His journey proved eventful, as he fell into Antwerp harbour when being unloaded from a steamboat and was only rescued after a half-hour struggle. He eventually arrived safely at his new home and lived at the Imperial Stud at Kisber until his death in the fall of 1866.

He is commonly referred to as Allama Iqbal (, Allama lit. Scholar.) After studying in England and Germany, Iqbal established a law practice, but concentrated primarily on writing scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy and religion. He is best known for his poetic works, including Asrar-e-Khudi--which brought a knighthood-- Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and the Bang-e- Dara. In Iran, where he is known as IqbƒÅl-e LƒÅhorƒ´ ( Iqbal of Lahore), he is highly regarded for his Persian works. Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic civilisation across the world, but specifically in India; a series of famous lectures he delivered to this effect were published as The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. One of the most prominent leaders of the All India Muslim League, Iqbal encouraged the creation of a \\"state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims\\" in his 1930 presidential address. Iqbal encouraged and worked closely with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and he is known as Muffakir-e-Pakistan (\\"The Thinker of Pakistan\\"), Shair-e-Mashriq (\\"The Poet of the East\\"), and Hakeem-ul-Ummat (\\"The Sage of Ummah\\"). He is officially recognised as the \\"national poet\\" in Pakistan. The anniversary of his birth ( - Y≈çm-e WelƒÅdat-e Mu·∏•ammad IqbƒÅl) on 9 November is a holiday in Pakistan.  Early life  Mohammad Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in Sialkot, in the Punjab province of British India in what is now Pakistan. During the reign of Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan--according to scholar Bruce Lawrence--Iqbal's brahmin ancestors from Kashmir had converted to Islam. However, according to Iqbal biographer Mustansir Mir, the conversion to Islam took place even earlier, some four and a half centuries before Iqbal's birth. Much later, around the turn of the nineteenth century, as the Kashmir region was coming under Sikh rule, his grandfather's family emigrated to the Punjab. According to scholar Annemarie Schimmel, Iqbal often wrote about his being \\"a son of Kashmiri-Brahmans but (being) acquainted with the wisdom of R√ªm and Tabriz.\\" Iqbal's father, Nur Muhammad, was a tailor, who lacked formal education, but who had great devotion to Islam and a \\"mystically tinged piety.\\" Iqbal's mother was known in the family as a \\"wise, generous woman who quietly gave financial help to poor and needy women and arbitrated in neighbor's disputes.\\" After his mother's death in 1914, Iqbal wrote an elegy for her: > Who would wait for me anxiously in my native place? > Who would display restlessness if my letter fails to arrive > I will visit thy grave with this complaint: > Who will now think of me in midnight prayers? > All thy life thy love served me with devotion-- > When I became fit to serve thee, thou hast departed. At the age of four, young Iqbal was sent regularly to a mosque, where he learned how to read the Quran in Arabic. The following year, and for many years thereafter, Iqbal became a student of Syed Mir Hassan, who was then the head of the Madrassa in Sialkot, and later to become a widely-known Muslim scholar. An advocate of secular European education for the Muslim's of British India--in the tradition of Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan--Hassan convinced Iqbal's father to send him to Sialkot's Scotch Mission College, where Hassan was professor of Arabic. Two years later, in 1895, Iqbal obtained the Faculty of Arts diploma from the college. That year Iqbal's family arranged for him to be married to Karim Bibi, the daughter of an affluent Gujrati physician. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mi'raj Begam (born 1895) and a son, Aftab (born 1899). Iqbal's third child, a son, died soon after birth. Husband and wife were unhappy in their marriage and eventually divorced in 1916. Later the same year, Iqbal entered the Government College in Lahore where he studied philosophy, English literature and Arabic and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating cum laude. He won a gold medal for placing first in the examination in philosophy. While studying for his masters degree, Iqbal came under the influence of Sir Thomas Arnold, a scholar of Islam and modern philosophy at the college. Arnold exposed the young man to Western culture and ideas, and served as a bridge for Iqbal between the ideas of East and West. Iqbal was appointed to a readership in Arabic at the Oriental College in Lahore, and he published his first book in Urdu, The Knowledge of Economics in 1903. In 1905 Iqbal published the patriotic song, Tarana-e-Hind (Song of India). At Sir Thomas's encouragement, Iqbal travelled to Europe and spent many years studying there. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College at Cambridge in 1907, while simultaneously studying law at Lincoln's Inn, from where he qualified as a barrister in 1908. Iqbal also met a Muslim student, Atiyah Faizi in 1907, and had a close relationship with her. In Europe, he started writing his poetry in Persian as well. Throughout his life, Iqbal would prefer writing in Persian as he believed it allowed him to fully express philosophical concepts, and it gave him a wider audience. It was while in England that he first participated in politics. Following the formation of the All-India Muslim League in 1906, Iqbal was elected to the executive committee of its British chapter in 1908. Together with two other politicians, Syed Hassan Bilgrami and Syed Ameer Ali, Iqbal sat on the subcommittee which drafted the constitution of the League. In 1907, Iqbal travelled to Germany to pursue a doctorate from the Faculty of Philosophy of the Ludwig-Maximilians- Universit√§t at Munich. Working under the supervision of Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal published a thesis titled: The Development of Metaphysics in Persia.Iqbal's \\"Development of Metaphysics in Persia\\" PhD thesis  Personal life   Background  Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in an ethnic Kashmiri family in Sialkot within the Punjab Province of British India (now in Pakistan).

One of Muneera's sons is the philanthropist-cum-socialite Yousuf Salahuddin.  Higher education in Europe  Iqbal was influenced by the teachings of Sir Thomas Arnold, his philosophy teacher at Government College Lahore, to pursue higher education in the West. In 1905, he travelled to England for that purpose. While already acquainted with Friedrich Nietzsche and Henri Bergson, Iqbal would discover Rumi slightly before his departure to England, and he would teach the Masnavi to his friend Swami Rama Tirtha, who in return would teach him Sanskrit.Syed Abdul Vahid, Glimpses of Iqbal, Iqbal Academy Pakistan, 1974, p. 77 Iqbal qualified for a scholarship from Trinity College, University of Cambridge, and obtained a Bachelor of Arts in 1906. In the same year he was called to the bar as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. In 1907, Iqbal moved to Germany to pursue his doctoral studies, and earned a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1908. Working under the guidance of Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal's doctoral thesis was entitled The Development of Metaphysics in Persia. In 1907, he had a close friendship with the writer Atiya Fyzee in both Britain and Germany. Atiya would later publish their correspondence. While Iqbal was in Heidelberg in 1907, his German professor Emma Wegenast taught him about Goethe's Faust, Heine and Nietzsche. He mastered German in three months.Sheila McDonough, Vito Salierno, The Flame of Sinai: Hope and Vision in Iqbal, Iqbal Academy Pakistan, 2002, p. 45 During his study in Europe, Iqbal began to write poetry in Persian. He preferred to write in this language because doing so made it easier to express his thoughts. He would write continuously in Persian throughout his life. Iqbal had a great interest in Islamic studies, especially Sufi beliefs. In his poetry, apart from independent ideologies, he also explores concepts of submission to Allah and following the path of Prophet Muhammad.  Academic career  Photograph taken during Allama Iqbal's youth in 1899 Iqbal began his career as a reader of Arabic after completing his Master of Arts degree in 1899, at Oriental College and shortly afterward was selected as a junior professor of philosophy at Government College Lahore, where he had also been a student in the past. He worked there until he left for England in 1905. In 1908, he returned from England and joined the same college again as a professor of philosophy and English literature. In the same period Iqbal began practising law at the Chief Court of Lahore, but he soon quit law practice and devoted himself to literary works, becoming an active member of Anjuman-e- Himayat-e-Islam. In 1919, he became the general secretary of the same organisation. Iqbal's thoughts in his work primarily focus on the spiritual direction and development of human society, centered around experiences from his travels and stays in Western Europe and the Middle East. He was profoundly influenced by Western philosophers such as Nietzsche, Bergson, and Goethe. He also closely worked with Ibrahim Hisham during his stay at the Aligarh Muslim University. The poetry and philosophy of Rumi strongly influenced Iqbal. Deeply grounded in religion since childhood, Iqbal began concentrating intensely on the study of Islam, the culture and history of Islamic civilisation and its political future, while embracing Rumi as \\"his guide\\". Iqbal would feature Rumi in the role of guide in many of his poems. Iqbal's works focus on reminding his readers of the past glories of Islamic civilisation and delivering the message of a pure, spiritual focus on Islam as a source for socio-political liberation and greatness. Iqbal denounced political divisions within and amongst Muslim nations, and frequently alluded to and spoke in terms of the global Muslim community or the Ummah. Iqbal's poetry was translated into many European languages in the early part of the 20th century. Iqbal's Asrar-i-Khudi and Javed Nama were translated into English by R. A. Nicholson and A. J. Arberry, respectively.  Legal career  Iqbal as a barrister-at-law Iqbal was not only a prolific writer but was also a known advocate. He appeared before the Lahore High Court in both civil and criminal matters. There are more than 100 reported judgments to his name.  Final years and death  The tomb of Muhammad Iqbal at the entrance of the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore In 1933, after returning from a trip to Spain and Afghanistan, Iqbal suffered from a mysterious throat illness.

Iqbal ceased practising law in 1934 and was granted a pension by the Nawab of Bhopal. In his final years, he frequently visited the Dargah of famous Sufi Ali Hujwiri in Lahore for spiritual guidance. After suffering for months from his illness, Iqbal died in Lahore on 21 April 1938. His tomb is located in Hazuri Bagh, the enclosed garden between the entrance of the Badshahi Mosque and the Lahore Fort, and official guards are provided by the Government of Pakistan.  Efforts and influences   Political  thumb|250px|Iqbal with Muslim politicians. (L to R): M. Iqbal (third), Syed Zafarul Hasan (sixth) at Aligarh Muslim University Iqbal first became interested in national affairs in his youth. He received considerable recognition from the Punjabi elite after his return from England in 1908, and he was closely associated with Mian Muhammad Shafi. When the All-India Muslim League was expanded to the provincial level, and Shafi received a significant role in the structural organisation of the Punjab Muslim League, Iqbal was made one of the first three joint secretaries along with Shaikh Abdul Aziz and Maulvi Mahbub Alam. While dividing his time between law practice and poetry, Iqbal remained active in the Muslim League. He did not support Indian involvement in World War I and stayed in close touch with Muslim political leaders such as Mohammad Ali Jouhar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a critic of the mainstream Indian National Congress, which he regarded as dominated by Hindus, and was disappointed with the League when, during the 1920s, it was absorbed in factional divides between the pro-British group led by Shafi and the centrist group led by Jinnah. In November 1926, with the encouragement of friends and supporters, Iqbal contested the election for a seat in the Punjab Legislative Assembly from the Muslim district of Lahore, and defeated his opponent by a margin of 3,177 votes. He supported the constitutional proposals presented by Jinnah to guarantee Muslim political rights and influence in a coalition with the Congress and worked with the Aga Khan and other Muslim leaders to mend the factional divisions and achieve unity in the Muslim League. While in Lahore he was a friend of Abdul Sattar Ranjoor.New Age Weekly. In Memory of Com Ranjoor  Iqbal, Jinnah and the concept of Pakistan  Ideologically separated from Congress Muslim leaders, Iqbal had also been disillusioned with the politicians of the Muslim League, owing to the factional conflict that plagued the League in the 1920s. Discontent with factional leaders like Shafi and Fazl-ur-Rahman, Iqbal came to believe that only Jinnah was a political leader capable of preserving unity and fulfilling the League's objectives of Muslim political empowerment. Building a strong, personal correspondence with Jinnah, Iqbal was influential in convincing Jinnah to end his self-imposed exile in London, return to India and take charge of the League. Iqbal firmly believed that Jinnah was the only leader capable of drawing Indian Muslims to the League and maintaining party unity before the British and the Congress: While Iqbal espoused the idea of Muslim-majority provinces in 1930, Jinnah would continue to hold talks with the Congress through the decade and only officially embraced the goal of Pakistan in 1940. Some historians postulate that Jinnah always remained hopeful for an agreement with the Congress and never fully desired the partition of India.Ayesha Jalal, The Sole Spokesman, pp. 14 Iqbal's close correspondence with Jinnah is speculated by some historians as having been responsible for Jinnah's embrace of the idea of Pakistan. Iqbal elucidated to Jinnah his vision of a separate Muslim state in a letter sent on 21 June 1937: Iqbal, serving as president of the Punjab Muslim League, criticised Jinnah's political actions, including a political agreement with Punjabi leader Sikandar Hyat Khan, whom Iqbal saw as a representative of feudal classes and not committed to Islam as the core political philosophy. Nevertheless, Iqbal worked constantly to encourage Muslim leaders and masses to support Jinnah and the League. Speaking about the political future of Muslims in India, Iqbal said:  Revival of Islamic polity  Iqbal with Choudhary Rahmat Ali and other Muslim leaders Iqbal's six English lectures were published in Lahore in 1930, and then by the Oxford University Press in 1934 in the book The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. The lectures had been delivered at Madras, Hyderabad and Aligarh. These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion and as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age. In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with the Muslim masses. Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey, he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim regions in India. Under a single Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects, especially concerning their existentially separate entity as Muslims. Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in Allahabad in the United Provinces, as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his presidential address on 29 December 1930 he outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in north-western India: In his speech, Iqbal emphasised that, unlike Christianity, Islam came with \\"legal concepts\\" with \\"civic significance\\", with its \\"religious ideals\\" considered as inseparable from social order: \\"Therefore, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, the construction of a policy on national lines, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\\" Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles. He thus became the first politician to articulate what would become known as the Two-nation theory‚Äîthat Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Even as he rejected secularism and nationalism he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would be a theocracy, and criticised the \\"intellectual attitudes\\" of Islamic scholars (ulema) as having \\"reduced the Law of Islam practically to the state of immobility\\". The latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He travelled across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League. He reiterated the ideas of his 1932 address, and, during the third Round Table Conference, he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces. He would serve as president of the Punjab Muslim League, and would deliver speeches and publish articles in an attempt to rally Muslims across India as a single political entity. Iqbal consistently criticised feudal classes in Punjab as well as Muslim politicians opposed to the League. Many accounts of Iqbal's frustration toward Congress leadership were also pivotal in providing a vision for the two-nation theory.  Patron of Tolu-e- Islam  Copy of the first issue of Tolu-e-Islam Iqbal was the first patron of Tolu-e-Islam, a historical, political, religious and cultural journal of the Muslims of British India. For a long time, Iqbal wanted a journal to propagate his ideas and the aims and objectives of the All India Muslim League. In 1935, according to his instructions, Syed Nazeer Niazi initiated and edited the journal, named after Iqbal's poem \\"Tulu'i Islam\\". Niazi dedicated the first issue of the journal to Iqbal. The journal would play an important role in the Pakistan movement. Later, the journal was continued by Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, who had contributed many articles in its early editions.  Literary work   Persian  Iqbal's poetic works are written primarily in Persian rather than Urdu. Among his 12,000 verses of poetry, about 7,000 verses are in Persian. In 1915, he published his first collection of poetry, the Asrar-i-Khudi (Secrets of the Self) in Persian. The poems emphasise the spirit and self from a religious perspective. Many critics have called this Iqbal's finest poetic work. In Asrar-i-Khudi, Iqbal explains his philosophy of \\"Khudi\\", or \\"Self\\". Iqbal's use of the term \\"Khudi\\" is synonymous with the word \\"Rooh\\" used in the Quran for a divine spark which is present in every human being, and was said by Iqbal to be present in Adam, for which God ordered all of the angels to prostrate in front of Adam. Iqbal condemns self- destruction. For him, the aim of life is self-realization and self-knowledge. He charts the stages through which the \\"Self\\" has to pass before finally arriving at its point of perfection, enabling the knower of the \\"Self\\" to become a vice-regent of God. In his Rumuz-i-Bekhudi (Hints of Selflessness), Iqbal seeks to prove the Islamic way of life is the best code of conduct for a nation's viability. A person must keep his characteristics intact, he asserts, but once this is achieved, he should sacrifice his ambitions for the needs of the nation. Man cannot realise the \\"Self\\" outside of society. Published in 1917, this group of poems has as its main themes the ideal community, Islamic ethical and social principles, and the relationship between the individual and society. Although he supports Islam, Iqbal also recognises the positive aspects of other religions. Rumuz-i-Bekhudi complements the emphasis on the self in Asrar-e-Khudi and the two collections are often put in the same volume under the title Asrar-i-Rumuz (Hinting Secrets). It is addressed to the world's Muslims. Iqbal's 1924 publication, the Payam-e-Mashriq (The Message of the East), is closely connected to the West-√∂stlicher Diwan by the German poet Goethe. Goethe bemoans the West having become too materialistic in outlook, and expects the East will provide a message of hope to resuscitate spiritual values. Iqbal styles his work as a reminder to the West of the importance of morality, religion, and civilisation by underlining the need for cultivating feeling, ardor, and dynamism. He asserts that an individual can never aspire to higher dimensions unless he learns of the nature of spirituality. In his first visit to Afghanistan, he presented Payam-e Mashreq to King Amanullah Khan. In it, he admired the uprising of Afghanistan against the British Empire. In 1933, he was officially invited to Afghanistan to join the meetings regarding the establishment of Kabul University. The Zabur-e-Ajam (Persian Psalms), published in 1927, includes the poems \\"Gulshan-e-Raz-e-Jadeed\\" (\\"Garden of New Secrets\\") and \\"Bandagi Nama\\" (\\"Book of Slavery\\"). In \\"Gulshan- e-Raz-e-Jadeed\\", Iqbal first poses questions, then answers them with the help of ancient and modern insight. \\"Bandagi Nama\\" denounces slavery and attempts to explain the spirit behind the fine arts of enslaved societies. Here, as in other books, Iqbal insists on remembering the past, doing well in the present and preparing for the future, while emphasising love, enthusiasm and energy to fulfill the ideal life. Iqbal's 1932 work, the Javed Nama (Book of Javed), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of Ibn Arabi and Dante's The Divine Comedy, through mystical and exaggerated depictions across time. Iqbal depicts himself as Zinda Rud (\\"A stream full of life\\") guided by Rumi, \\"the master\\", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal and Tipu Sultan of Mysore by betraying them for the benefit of the British colonists, and thus delivering their country to the shackles of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the \\"new generation\\". Pas Chih Bayed Kard Ay Aqwam-e-Sharq includes the poem \\"Musafir\\" (\\"The Traveller\\"). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi as a character and gives an exposition of the mysteries of Islamic laws and Sufi perceptions. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. \\"Musafir\\" is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the Pashtun people are counselled to learn the \\"secret of Islam\\" and to \\"build up the self\\" within themselves. His love of the Persian language is evident in his works and poetry. He says in one of his poems: Kuliyat Iqbal, Iqbal Academy Publications, 1990, Lahore, Pakistan Translation: Even though in sweetness Hindi* is sugar ‚Äì (but) speech method in Dari [the variety of Persian in Afghanistan ] is sweeter *  Urdu  Iqbal's Bang-e-Dara (The Call of the Marching Bell), his first collection of Urdu poetry, was published in 1924. It was written in three distinct phases of his life. The poems he wrote up to 1905‚Äîthe year he left for England‚Äîreflect patriotism and the imagery of nature, including the \\"Tarana-e-Hindi\\" (\\"The Song of India\\"), and \\"Tarana-e-Milli\\" (\\"The Song of the Community\\"). The second set of poems date from 1905‚Äì1908, when Iqbal studied in Europe, and dwell upon the nature of European society, which he emphasised had lost spiritual and religious values. This inspired Iqbal to write poems on the historical and cultural heritage of Islam and the Muslim community, with a global perspective. Iqbal urges the entire Muslim community, addressed as the Ummah, to define personal, social and political existence by the values and teachings of Islam. Iqbal's works were in Persian for most of his career, but after 1930 his works were mainly in Urdu. His works in this period were often specifically directed at the Muslim masses of India, with an even stronger emphasis on Islam and Muslim spiritual and political reawakening. Published in 1935, Bal-e-Jibril (Wings of Gabriel) is considered by many critics as his finest Urdu poetry and was inspired by his visit to Spain, where he visited the monuments and legacy of the kingdom of the Moors. It consists of ghazals, poems, quatrains and epigrams and carries a strong sense of religious passion. Zarb-i-Kalim (or The Rod of Moses) is another philosophical poetry book of Allama Iqbal in Urdu, it was published in 1936, two years before his death. In which he described as his political manifesto. It was published with the subtitle \\"A Declaration of War Against the Present Times. Muhammad Iqbal argues that modern problems are due to the godlessness, materialism and injustice of modern civilisation, which feeds on the subjugation and exploitation of weak nations, especially the Indian Muslims. Iqbal's final work was Armughan-e-Hijaz (The Gift of Hijaz), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, and the second part contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the Hijaz in his imagination. The profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems. Iqbal's vision of mystical experience is clear in one of his Urdu ghazals, which was written in London during his student days. Some verses of that ghazal are:  English  Iqbal wrote two books, The Development of Metaphysics in Persia (1908) and The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam (1930), and many letters in the English language. In these, he revealed his thoughts regarding Persian ideology and Islamic Sufism ‚Äì in particular, his beliefs that Islamic Sufism activates the searching soul to a superior perception of life. He also discussed philosophy, God and the meaning of prayer, human spirit and Muslim culture, as well as other political, social and religious problems. Iqbal was invited to Cambridge to participate in a conference in 1931, where he expressed his views, including those on the separation of church and state, to students and other participants:  Punjabi  Iqbal also wrote some poems in Punjabi, such as \\"Piyaara Jedi\\" and \\"Baba Bakri Wala\\", which he penned in 1929 on the occasion of his son Javid's birthday. A collection of his Punjabi poetry was put on display at the Iqbal Manzil in Sialkot.  Modern reputation   \\"Poet of the East\\"  Allama Iqbal after the conferment of a Doctorate of Literature by the University of the Punjab in 1933 Iqbal has been referred to as the \\"Poet of the East\\" by academics, institutions and the media. The Vice-Chancellor of Quaid-e-Azam University, Dr. Masoom Yasinzai, stated in a seminar addressing a distinguished gathering of educators and intellectuals that Iqbal is not only a poet of the East but is a universal poet. Moreover, Iqbal is not restricted to any specific segment of the world community, but he is for all humanity. Iqbal's revolutionary works through his poetry affected the Muslims of the subcontinent. Iqbal thought that Muslims had long been suppressed by the colonial enlargement and growth of the West. For this concept, Iqbal is recognised as the \\"Poet of the East\\". }} The Urdu world is very familiar with Iqbal as the \\"Poet of the East\\". Iqbal is also called Muffakir-e-Pakistan, \\"The Thinker of Pakistan\\") and Hakeem-ul-Ummat (\\"The Sage of the Ummah\\"). The Pakistan government officially named him Pakistan‚Äôs \\"national poet\\". Iran  In Iran, Iqbal is known as IqbƒÅl-e LƒÅhorƒ´ () (Iqbal of Lahore). Iqbal's Asrare-i-Khudi and Bal-i-Jibreel are particularly popular in Iran. At the same time, many scholars in Iran have recognised the importance of Iqbal's poetry in inspiring and sustaining the Iranian Revolution of 1979. During the early phases of the revolutionary movement, it was common to see people gathering in a park or corner to listen to someone reciting Iqbal's Persian poetry, which is why people of all ages in Iran today are familiar with at least some of his poetry, notably Zabur-i-Ajam. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has stated, \\"We have a large number of non-Persian-speaking poets in the history of our literature, but I cannot point out any of them whose poetry possesses the qualities of Iqbal's Persian poetry. Iqbal was not acquainted with Persian idiom, as he spoke Urdu at home and talked to his friends in Urdu or English. He did not know the rules of Persian prose writing. [...] In spite of not having tasted the Persian way of life, never living in the cradle of Persian culture, and never having any direct association with it, he cast with great mastery the most delicate, the most subtle and radically new philosophical themes into the mould of Persian poetry, some of which are unsurpassable yet.\\" By the early 1950s, Iqbal became known among the intelligentsia of Iran. Iranian poet laureate Muhammad Taqi Bahar universalised Iqbal in Iran. He highly praised the work of Iqbal in Persian. In 1952, Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq, a national hero because of his oil nationalisation policy, broadcast a special radio message on Iqbal Day and praised his role in the struggle of the Indian Muslims against British imperialism. At the end of the 1950s, Iranians published the complete Persian works. In the 1960s, Iqbal's thesis on Persian philosophy was translated from English to Persian. Ali Shariati, a Sorbonne-educated sociologist, supported Iqbal as his role model as Iqbal had Rumi. An example of the admiration and appreciation of Iran for Iqbal is that he received the place of honour in the pantheon of the Persian elegy writers. Iqbal became even more popular in Iran in the 1970s. His verses appeared on banners, and his poetry was recited at meetings of intellectuals. Iqbal inspired many intellectuals, including Ali Shariati, Mehdi Bazargan and Abdulkarim Soroush. His book The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam was translated by Mohammad Masud Noruzi. Key Iranian thinkers and leaders who were influenced by Iqbal's poetry during the rise of the Iranian revolution include Khamenei, Shariati and Soroush, although much of the revolutionary guard was familiar with Iqbal's poetry. At the inauguration of the First Iqbal Summit in Tehran (1986), Khamenei stated that in its \\"conviction that the Quran and Islam are to be made the basis of all revolutions and movements\\", Iran was \\"exactly following the path that was shown to us by Iqbal\\". Shariati, who has been described as a core ideologue for the Iranian Revolution, described Iqbal as a figure who brought a message of \\"rejuvenation\\", \\"awakening\\" and \\"power\\" to the Muslim world.  The West  Sign for the street Iqbal-Ufer in Heidelberg, Germany, honouring Iqbal Iqbal's views on the Western world have been applauded by Westerners, including United States Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, who said that Iqbal's beliefs had \\"universal appeal\\". Soviet biographer N. P. Anikoy wrote: Others, including Wilfred Cantwell Smith, stated that with Iqbal's anti-capitalist holdings, he was \\"anti-intellect\\", because \\"capitalism fosters intellect\\". Freeland Abbott objected to Iqbal's views of the West, saying that they were based on the role of imperialism and that Iqbal was not immersed enough in Western culture to learn about the various benefits of the modern democracies, economic practices and science. Critics of Abbot's viewpoint note that Iqbal was raised and educated in the European way of life, and spent enough time there to grasp the general concepts of Western civilisation. Legacy Iqbal is widely commemorated in Pakistan, where he is regarded as the ideological founder of the state. His birthday is annually commemorated in Pakistan as Iqbal Day, and until 2018 it was also a public holiday. Iqbal is the namesake of many public institutions, including the Allama Iqbal Campus Punjab University in Lahore, the Allama Iqbal Medical College in Lahore, Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, Allama Iqbal Open University in Pakistan, Iqbal Memorial Institute in Srinagar, Allama Iqbal Library in University of Kashmir, the Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore, Iqbal Hostel in Government College University, Lahore, the Allama Iqbal Hall at Nishtar Medical College in Multan, Gulshan-e-Iqbal Town in Karachi, Allama Iqbal Town in Lahore, Allama Iqbal Hall at Aligarh Muslim University, Allama Iqbal Hostel at Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi and Iqbal Hall at the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. In India, his song \\"Tarana-e-Hind\\" is frequently played as a patriotic song speaking of communal harmony. The Pakistani government and public organisations have sponsored the establishment of educational institutions, colleges, and schools dedicated to Iqbal and have established the Iqbal Academy Pakistan to research, teach and preserve his works, literature and philosophy. The Allama Iqbal Stamps Society was established for the promotion of Iqbal in philately and in other hobbies. His son Javid Iqbal served as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

According to online media analytical source Forensic News, the company‚Äôs annual revenue exceeded $100 million by October 2019. 2011 Grand Strategy Competition Between June and July 2011, Wikistrat hosted an \\"International Grand Strategy Competition\\" which tested the company's collaborative competition approach. More than thirty teams of MA and PhD students representing universities and think tanks participated in the month-long competition in which teams simulated thirteen countries. Participants' affiliations included the UK Defence Forum, the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies' Center for Global Affairs, the University of Kentucky's Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce, Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and the University of Sussex. The team from Claremont Graduate University's School of Politics and Economics won the competition and a $10,000 prize. The NYU team's predicted that Russia would ultimately have to outsource its security if it were to continue experiencing demographic decline, and if its economy were to remain heavily dependent on commodity exports. Participants from the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies argued that India was rooting for Pakistan's disintegration, considering the collapse of the Muslim state as a prerequisite to fully institutionalizing India's alliance with the United States. Students at Sussex believed that North Korea would collapse without Chinese support and therefore recommended that the nation diversify its allies. Organizers were surprised by the level of interest in the competition. Media exposure In 2010, it ran a simulation on the death of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, the results of which were referenced (in articles by the organization's chief strategist) on CNN, Time and World Politics Review after Kim died in late 2011. The firm has been cited by such media outlets as CNN, Reuters, Russia Today, Fox News and NPR as a consultancy of reference for geopolitical issues. In 2013, Wikistrat ran a simulation for AFRICOM that explored various futures for illicit trafficking in the Trans-Sahel region of Africa.http://www.africom.mil/Newsroom/Article/11746/wikistrat-briefs- alternative-futures-to-africom-staff In January 2014, Wikistrat analysts predicted the rise of a separatist movement in Crimea seeking Russian annexation. This process unfolded in March 2014, prompting digital magazine InformationWeek to write that Wikistrat \\"beat the CIA.\\"  2016 US presidential election campaign  In 2015 Zamel's company Wikistrat spent a week running scenarios called the Cyber Mercenaries project on how a U.S. election interference campaign could be made by Russian cyber actors which was reported to Donald Trump Jr in 2016. Zamel's company Psy Group formed a partnership with Cambridge Analytica to jointly bid for contracts with the American Government after the 2016 Trump election win. US Special Counsel Robert Mueller ‚Äï who investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 American elections ‚Äï questioned Wikistrat founder Joel Zamel about his relationship with George Nader, a witness who is cooperating in the Special Counsel investigation. Mueller also asked questions about the work of Wikistrat. Donald Trump Jr. had met with Zamel, Nader, and Erik Prince in Trump Tower in August 2016. Their discussion reportedly included an offer on the part of Zamel for pro-Trump manipulation of social media. On April 5, 2019 the Senate Intelligence Committee sent a letter to Walter Soriano the owner of USG Security Limited based in Britain and Israel for his communication with Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Psy-Group, Wikistrat, and Black Cube, Orbis Business Intelligence (a firm co-founded by Christopher Steele).  Jamal Khashoggi  According to a July 2018 email, Oren Kesler told a Wikistrat employee that Jamal Khashoggi worked for the firm. In a separate email sent shortly after Khashoggi's death, Kesler denied that Khashoggi ever worked for Wikistrat. In late 2019, Wikistrat finally admitted to Forensic News that Khashoggi had in fact worked for the firm. According to articles from The Daily Beast and The New York Times, the founder of Wikistrat, Joel Zamel, met with General Ahmed al-Assiri, the Saudi general who ordered Khashoggi's assassination, in early 2017 to discuss covert operations to destabilize Iran. One of the topics discussed at these meetings was the use of covert operations to assassinate dissidents.

Parrado, as he often signed his articles (Cordoba, Spain, 3 January 1971 ‚Äì Baghdad, Iraq, 7 April 2003), was a journalist and a Spanish war correspondent. He was the son of politician Julio Anguita Gonz√°lez, and his mother, Antonia Rojas Parrado, was Deputy Mayor of the city of C√≥rdoba. He was killed when an Iraqi missile hit him when he was in Baghdad covering the 2003 Iraq invasion. in Canal Sur Education and career thumb Julio Anguita Parrado studied journalism at the Complutense University. His active career began in the summer of 1990, and by August of that year he published his first story in the Cordoba Journal. He worked at the newspaper until 1993 when he began working with El Mundo (Spain), joining the international section. He always wanted to live in New York, a fact that got him to be appointed as an attached correspondent of El Mundo. There he had the opportunity to study a Master in Financial Reporting and to collaborate with the Latin portal starmedia.com. He witnessed live the attacks of September 11, being the first to report to the newspaper for which he worked. He was prepared intensely for reporting the Iraq War, enlisting in a training course for war correspondents organized by the Pentagon. In February the Pentagon had conducted a training course for war correspondents at a military base of the U.S. Marines for journalists travelling embedded in the troops. From 21 March 2003, he covered the war with the Third Infantry Division of the U.S. Army. Death Julio Anguita Parrado was working as an embedded journalist in the 2003 Iraq war. He was with the 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division, advancing from the west and southwest of Baghdad. On 7 April 2003, he was south of Baghdad, about 15 miles from downtown, after crossing the country with troops from Kuwait. Parrado took what he felt was a wise decision. He chose to stay in the communications center of the 2nd Brigade, instead of travelling with the troops in the raid that they would perform on the center of Baghdad, believing he would be safer at the base. The base was unfortunately hit by a missile. According to Israeli daily Jerusalem Post, the missile came from a coordinated attack by militant Palestinian and Jordanian volunteers. This was the first military conflict that Parrado covered. Early in the afternoon the American officer, Mike Birmingham, confirmed that two soldiers and two journalists were killed in a missile attack launched by Iraq. Just over an hour after another alarm was raised. By midafternoon, the Spanish Embassy in Washington confirmed the nationality of the dead: a Spanish journalist and a German. It was finally confirmed that Julio A. Parrado and German photographer Christian Liebig of Focus magazine were the deceased. Recognition On 8 April, an extraordinary plenary session of the City Council of his hometown was called. That day was also declared a day of mourning in the city. In 2007 the Union of Journalists Andalusian (SPA) and the Municipality of C√≥rdoba established the Prize Julio Anguita Parrado of Journalism. Since its inception the winners have been: * 2007: Iraqi writer and journalist Eman Ahmad Jam√°s * 2008: Colombian journalist Eduardo Gonz√°lez M√°rquez (2008) * 2009: Congolese journalist Azzuba Caddy * 2010: Journalist and human rights advocate Monica Fernandez Barnabas (2010) * 2011: Spanish photographer and journalist Gervasio S√°nchez. * 2012: Egyptian journalist Shahira Amin * 2013: Greek journalist Kostas Vaxevanis  References   See also  * Jos√© Couso Category:1971 births Category:Iraq War Category:Journalists killed while covering the Iraq War Category:Spanish war correspondents Category:2003 deaths ","title":"Julio Anguita Parrado"},{"id":"34348629","title":"2012 United States presidential election in New Jersey"},{"id":"34348642","title":"2012 United States presidential election in New Mexico"},{"id":"34348645","text":"Watch City Steampunk Festival, previously known as \\"International Steampunk City\\" and the \\"Watch City Festival,\\" is the oldest annual open-air, indoor/outdoor steampunk festival in the United States, and is held in Waltham, Massachusetts. It began in 2011 as a fundraiser by and for the benefit of the Charles River Museum of Industry and Innovation, which suffered significant flood damage in March 2010. The original event pioneered a new model of science fiction convention in which the broader, non-fandom public community was deliberately engaged by presenting events and programming in city spaces and local businesses often free to the public. This is still a primary feature of the Festival today. According to then CRMII Executive Director and first Festival Director Elln Hagny, the event was inspired by the success of two events in 2010: the New England Steampunk Festival and a steampunk exhibit, organized by Bruce Rosenbaum of ModVic, called \\"Steampunk: Form & Function,\\" the first steampunk exhibit featured in a major American museum. The Charles River Museum ceased its direct involvement in organizing the Festival after 2013. There was no festival in 2014. In 2015, renamed the Watch City Steampunk Festival, the event returned. Now under the auspices of the Downtown Waltham Partnership, a Waltham-based nonprofit supporting the city's community, it became a more city-centric event. In addition to that significant change, the 2015 Festival calendar was scaled back slightly to evening events on Friday and the full outdoor festival occurring only on Saturday (previous years had the Festival continuing through until Sunday), allowing for a Sunday rain date in the event of inclement weather. 2015 was the first year that the full schedule of daytime festival events was entirely free to the public. The Festival brought in an estimated Saturday attendance of over 10,000 at the 2015 event. While the programming is typical of a steampunk festival, including art exhibitions, panel discussions on a variety of topics, steampunk music, crafts workshops, vendors, and performances, the Watch City Steampunk Festival uniquely makes extensive use of its host city's public spaces and Waltham's unique place in the history of American industry. It fosters interaction with both local businesses and organizations, making it truly a Waltham community event. The Festival continued in 2016, with a Friday evening gala on May 6 and the main festival on Saturday, May 7. In 2017, with the Friday, May 12 evening event included a free, outdoor circus-style fire performance preceding the kickoff gala, and the main event held on the Common on Saturday, May 13. The Festival date for 2018 was May 12 with a day-long circus theme. This year was the first without a Friday night event. There was rain throughout the day. As a result, attendance was slightly down from prior years. Still, the 2018 Festival was a success, with the steampunk attendees and public defying the weather to enjoy the activities and attractions. The 2019 Watch City Steampunk Festival was held Saturday, May 11, with a Friday evening kickoff dinner featuring featured festival performer Professor Elemental. The 2020 Watch City Steampunk Festival was cancelled due to Covid-19 .

In the first eight League matches played by Derby County the club had already tried three players at inside- right, the latest having been William Chatterton. After the 6-2 thrashing at Everton Chatterton was out of favour and so John Lees was selected to make his debut on 3 November 1888 at Dudley Road, Wolverhampton, then home of high- flying Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Ellerbe speaking in Washington on September 5, 2013Kenneth B. Ellerbe was the fire chief of the District of Columbia Fire & EMS Department from January 1, 2011 to July 2, 2014. He was chosen by mayor-elect Vincent C. Gray in December 2010. From August 2009 to December 2010, Ellerbe was the Sarasota County fire chief. Early life Ellerbe, born on April 10, 1960, is a native of the District of Columbia. He is the eldest of four children, with three brothers ‚Äì Keenan, Kelton, and Kevin. Education Ellerbe is a 1978 graduate of Calvin Coolidge High School in Washington, D.C. He holds a B.S. in public administration (1996) and an M.P.A. from the University of the District of Columbia (2006). He is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in political science from Howard University. Career in Sarasota, Florida Ellerbe left the District of Columbia department in July 2009, to become the fire chief in Sarasota. According to Ellerbe, he decided to make the move to Florida because he didn't see his career moving forward in D.C. at the time. He made an annual income of $112,500. This leave was under a controversial agreement that would have kept him on the rolls until his 50th birthday and allowed him to collect an additional $600,000 from the pension fund. The deal was terminated in December 2009, after the Washington Times reported on it. During his time in Sarasota, Ellerbe illegally attempted to claim a homestead exemption for his home in Washington. Career in Washington, DC Kenneth Ellerbe first joined the DC Fire Department in 1982. After 27 years, Ellerbe joined Florida's Sarasota County Fire Department. Ellerbe left the Sarasota department after less than a year and a half to continuing working as the Fire and EMS Chief of Washington, DC. Ellerbe's salary before leaving for Florida was $149,992. He now makes $187,302 with the DC Fire Department. Treatment of employees In early 2000, a group of firefighters claimed they were unfairly transferred by Ellerbe, who was then interim fire chief. The American Civil Liberties Union took up their case, and one of the first acts of the newly appointed permanent replacement fire chief, Ronnie Few, was to repeal those transfers. At a June 28, 2010 meeting, two senior supervisors in the Sarasota department met with Ellerbe to discuss the concerns of female employees who said \\"they feel uncomfortable around the chief because he looks them up and down and 'talks to my chest'\\". Ellerbe's response was \\"It's part of my heritage to check people out, and you can tell them that\\", and \\"I haven't seen anything in this department that I'd want to undress with my eyes anyway, and you can tell them that.\\" At least one female member of the department documented and reported Ellerbe's behavior. As fire chief in D.C., Ellerbe changed the policy of providing light-duty positions to pregnant firefighters. Ellerbe limited the time a sick or injured firefighter could spend at a desk to 30 days, which was not enough time for pregnant firefighters to protect their unborn children from the hazards of firefighting. After pressure from the firefighters' union and City Council members Mendelsohn and Cheh, the chief increased the time in a light duty position to 90 days, roughly one-third of the time required. Media coverage of the policy upset Chief Ellerbe and led him to threaten the union president with reprisal. In February 2012, Ellerbe ordered maintenance crews to paint over the \\"DCFD\\" on the doors of Engine Co. 7's quarters, where the local union president worked. In October 2012, an arbitrator ruled that Ellerbe's treatment of the union local president was unlawful retaliation. D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson referred to the ruling 'sobering'. In April 2012, Chief Ellerbe demoted one of his battalion chiefs, for a decision he had made as a hearing officer in a disciplinary case. A month later, he transferred another battalion chief, who had been a hearing officer for the same incident, to desk duty. In July of the same year, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to the DC Attorney General's office, questioning whether firefighters could expect due process in disciplinary cases. In May 2013, Ellerbe dismissed a female recruit's complaint of sexual harassment as \\"not sexual in nature\\". In September 2013, Ellerbe transferred a paramedic firefighter to desk duty and placed him on 'non-patient contact' for writing a letter to the DC City Council warning of a \\"dire situation\\" in emergency medical services being provided to the city due to a lack of coverage created by a lack of advanced life support providers. In his letter, he cited the steady decline in the number of paramedics within the department due to attrition and Ellerbe's lack of hiring, and informed them that the remaining paramedics were suffering from \\"burnout\\" due to the increased workloads from being forced to work 36-hour shifts and an increase in call volume placed on the small number of paramedic engine companies operating on a daily basis. The letter was sparked by a run in which a five-month-old child went into cardiac arrest. The paramedic's engine company was sent on the call from over two miles away due to the lack of advanced life support units in operation. The child later died at the hospital. At a D.C. Council's public safety committee hearing in March, 2014, Kevin Byrne, a deputy fire chief, testified that after arriving in 2011, Ellerbe \\"went to war with his senior staff\\". Staffing policies As fire chief in Sarasota, Ellerbe cut the staffing of fire engines from three firefighters to two, half of the National Fire Protection Association's staffing recommendations of four firefighters per company, and less than the three generally required as minimum throughout the country. On January 13, 2012, Ellerbe published an opinion piece in the Washington Post, where he espoused the idea that he could reduce firefighter fatigue by changing from a 42-hour workweek to a 56-hour workweek. The Washington Post had previously published support for the chief's plan, despite being in contrast to the existing science. The only research specifically regarding firefighter work schedules stated \\"With respect to sustaining cognitive performance in the face of nocturnal alarms, clearly schedule 4 [the 24-hour- on, 72-hour-off schedule that the DCFD currently works] is the best schedule\\" The chief's plan would have cut the number of firefighters by a whole shift, or 475 firefighters. The reduction in force was originally proposed by Ellerbe in his fiscal year 2012 budget oversight document, in which he proposed that the savings from the attrition of firefighters resulting from schedule changes could be used to expand the fire cadet program for DC residents. In January 2012, Ellerbe prohibited firefighters from wearing jackets with the letters \\"DCFD\\" on the back. (The fire department did not issue rainwear or cold- weather clothing to the firefighters who staffed the fire trucks and ambulances, only to non-firefighter Emergency Medical Service personnel and management.) Prior to this order, members of the department had purchased their own outerwear, and had it embroidered with \\"DCFD\\" and their fire company affiliation. In response to this order, the members began to wear plain blue jackets or otherwise obscure the offending letters. Within weeks, an order was issued for another uniform change, the fifth in a year, that prohibited plain blue jackets. In response to Ellerbe's proposed shift change, the resultant reduction in force, multiple uniform orders, and citing \\"zero confidence in his ability to lead the department\\", more than 100 firefighters turned their backs to him during the question-and-answer portion of the department's first ever State of the Department speech. In response, Lon Walls, the Fire and Emergency Medical Services Communications Director, tweeted: \\"Just witnessed a blatant display of racism and disrespect shown to an African American leader. I guess this is a warmup for tonight's SOUA.\\" In November 2012, Ellerbe made public a plan to remove all advanced life support ambulances from service overnight, a total of 14 transport units. On the night of December 31, 2012, Ellerbe's department placed 11 transport units out of service, blaming excessive sick leave taken by the members of the department that morning. As a result, many patients had to wait for transport units, including one cardiac arrest patient who had to wait 40 minutes for an ambulance from neighboring Prince George's County, MD. That patient died. A stabbing victim had to be transported in the cab of a fire truck because of the lack of an ambulance. On March 5, 2013, a Washington D.C. police officer was struck by a hit and run driver near A and 46th streets in SE. A paramedic engine company from D.C.F.D. arrived eight minutes after the officer was struck. That officer was transported by a Prince George's County ambulance because there were no D.C.F.D ambulances available. More than 10 units had been placed out of service due to a new policy the fire chief had implemented. The Prince George's ambulance arrived at least 20 minutes after the officer was struck. In late June 2013, the DC City Council's Judiciary Committee recommended against approving Ellerbe's plan to reduce the number of ambulances in service overnight. Fleet issues In June 2011, 28% of the department's ambulances were out of service because of mechanical problems. The union claimed that there were no reserve fleet from which to draw. During a heat wave, Chief Ellerbe placed ambulances with broken air conditioning in service. Temperature inside at least one ambulance was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The department later accused employees, in general, of sabotaging vehicles, without accusing any individuals. In February 2013, at the behest of Committee Chair Tommy Wells, Chief Ellerbe provided the council with an inventory of the fire department vehicle fleet. The firefighter's union claimed that these numbers, given under oath, were wildly inaccurate. Ellerbe had previously stated that firefighters living outside of Washington, DC were a \\"homeland security threat\\", if he needed to call them back to emergency duty. One union official pointed out \\"They'd have nothing to ride on. We'd have to push them down the street in wheelbarrows.\\" In late February 2013, a DC Police officer was struck by a hit and run driver, and no D.C. ambulances were available to transport him to the hospital. He was eventually transported, after some delay, by an ambulance from neighboring Prince George's County. At the time, four D.C. ambulances were out of service for mechanical reasons. Two days later, firefighters transported a stroke victim to the hospital in the cab of a fire engine, because there were no ambulances available nearby. In March 2013, FEMS Chief Ellerbe announced that the deputy chief in charge of the apparatus fleet had retired. In June 2013, an audit of the department's vehicle fleet revealed that only slightly more than half of the department's ambulances available were available for service, and that the total vehicle count previously claimed by Ellerbe was drastically overstated. In September 2014, forty percent of the department's ladder trucks were taken out of service due to failed ladder inspections. Many accused Chief Ellerbe of being more concerned about clothing and decals than safety inspections of equipment. Mayor Vincent Gray's support Despite firing a series of high-profile government officials for relatively minor issues, Mayor Vincent Gray stood by Ellerbe. In an interview with WAMU, when asked what his relationship with Mayor Gray was, Ellerbe replied \\"I'm a subordinate agency director under the Mayor.\\" Tom Sherwood then produced footage from NBC4, shot in January 2011, where Ellerbe talked about knowing the mayor since he was 14 years old, and that they were \\"good friends\\". Since the agency's participation in the citywide Grade DC program under Ellerbe's supervision, the agency achieved a \\"B\\" score or higher, for the last four months achieving in the \\"A\\" range.http://grade.dc.gov/page/view-grades The Grade DC program came under fire from Washington Post columnist Mike Debonis on April 3, 2013, who wrote \\"it's hard to make the case that the public should take the grades (including the city's overall grade of A-) with anything besides a sizable grain of salt.\\" In the same article, influential local activist Dorothy Brizil was quoted referring to Ellerbe's agency: \\"I frankly find it quite questionable that FEMS would have a grade of A+ in the month of March.\\" On July 2, 2013, Councilperson Mary Cheh submitted a letter to Councilperson Tommy Wells, chair of the committee overseeing the Fire Department, stating her belief that \\"the current Chief [Ellerbe] no longer has the confidence of the people of the District and should resign.\\" In response, Paul Quander, Mayor Gray's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety and Justice, released a statement claiming that the department had improved over Ellerbe's tenure, that the controversies were rooted in previous administration's actions, and that \\"We should stay the course\\" with Chief Ellerbe. Personal life Ellerbe resides in Southeast D.C. He is divorced and has one daughter. References Category:People from Washington, D.C.

Lindich Castle was built at the instigation of Friedrich Ludwig In 1730, his father abdicated as Prince of Hohenzollern- Hechingen and Friedrich Ludwig took over. His passion for hunting led him to construct a Jagdschloss and summer residence, despite the principality's awkward financial situation. The architecturally outstanding Lindich Castle was constructed between 1739 and 1741, three kilometers west of Hechingen. He also built Jagdschloss Friedrichstal, southeast of Boll (now a suburb of Hechingen).

She is the 26th ship of her class. The second ship of the Coast Guard to bear the name, Monomoy is named after Monomoy Island which lies off the coast of Cape Cod. History Monomoy was originally commissioned in 1989 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, at Coast Guard Station Woods Hole. Her missions have included search and rescue, maritime law enforcement, alien interdiction, marine mammal protection and pollution response, homeland security, and presidential security. Monomoy provided security for President Clinton while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, and for George W. Bush while he was in Kennebunkport, Maine. Between 1994 and 1996, she conducted 25 law enforcement patrols in support of Operation Foxwood. Since 1996, Monomoy has conducted over 300 law enforcement boardings, including the interception and seizure in 1998 of 920 pounds of cocaine off the coast of Puerto Rico. Search and rescue is a Monomoy core competency. For rescuing the crew of the fishing vessel True Life, the crew of Monomoy was awarded a Coast Guard Unit Commendation. Another was awarded for the ship's assistance in wreckage recovery after the TWA Flight 800 disaster in 1996. Between 1994 and 1996, Monomoy participated in Operation Able Manner, which resulted in the rescue of 71 migrants in the Caribbean whose vessels were foundering, and for which the ship was awarded a Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation. After the September 11 attacks, Monomoy was one of the ships to patrol New York Harbor in District One. Recent service In 2003, Monomoy was forward deployed to Manama, Bahrain as part of Patrol Forces Southwest Asia in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and subsequently Operations Enduring Freedom and Inherent Resolve. Serving under the United States Fifth Fleet, she participated in anti-piracy patrols, among other missions. In 2012, while on patrol in the Persian Gulf, Monomoy aided in the rescue of six Iranian sailors from their sinking dhow. On 26 August 2014, Monomoy was involved in an incident with an armed Iranian dhow in the Persian Gulf. Monomoy launched the cutter small boat to query the dhow. The crew of the dhow pointed a machine gun at the small boat and Monomoy's crew responded with warning shots. The dhow did not respond. No U.S. personnel were harmed and they returned to the cutter. It is not known if the dhow was hit. On 12 January 2016, Monomoy was involved in the 2016 U.S.‚ÄìIran naval incident. According to military sources the two riverine command boats (RCBs) were on a routine transit from Kuwait to Bahrain, which serves as the home port for Task Force 56 under the Fifth Fleet. They were scheduled to refuel with the Monomoy during the transit, however, one RCB developed an engine problem and both boats stopped to solve the mechanical issue. During this time both boats drifted into Iranian waters, resulting in the capture of the RCBs. \\"Monomoy\\", noting the delay of the RCBs at the rendezvous point and tracking their progress notified the group's parent unit, Task Force 56.7. \\"Monomoy's\\" notification, combined with the actions of a female Navy petty officer who activated an EPIRB signal, while in Iranian custody, aided the search and rescue operation. \\"Monomoy\\" was subsequently tasked with combat search and rescue efforts inside Iranian territorial waters off Farsi Island to attempt to locate, and if possible, recover the RCB crews.

The business has been investigated for alleged \\"straw purchase\\" sales of firearms and ammunition that brought it attention from the media and the U.S. BATF. In 2015, the firm was ordered to pay nearly $6 million to two police officers for having illegally sold a gun. Controversy Straw purchase The shop has been involved with several controversies regarding the straw purchase of guns and the number of guns sold by the shop that have been used in crimes. The shop has had its license to sell firearms revoked. To stay open legal ownership of shop has changed hands several times within the relatives and friends of the original owner. In 2010, the Brady Center named the store the #1 seller of crime guns in the nation, based on an ATF statement. Law enforcement lawsuit Allegedly related, but separate from the straw purchase incidents, lawsuits have been filled by several members of the Milwaukee law enforcement community against Badger Guns because firearms purchased from the store were used to shoot officers in the course of their duties. On October 14, 2015, the store was ordered to pay almost $6 million to two police officers who were shot in the line of duty in 2009. The lawsuit is the second case of its type since the passage of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, and the only case to result in any damages. The law generally protects firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable when crimes have been committed with their products. However, both manufacturers and dealers can still be held liable for negligence when they have reason to know a gun is intended for use in a crime. Business operations In 2011 the shop ceased to sell guns, but continued to sell ammunition and gun accessories. The shop continued to operate a shooting range. In 2012 Mike Allan, a former employee of Badger Guns and the brother of original owner Adam Allan, obtained federal firearms licenses and changed the business name to Brew City Shooter Supply. The store now only sells to members who have taken a class, have a concealed carry permit, and/or demonstrate firearms competency along with paying an annual fee. The current owner announced that the intention of these requirements is to prevent straw purchases that caused problems previously.

Life He was son of the Rev. Samuel Haliday (or Hollyday) (1637‚Äì1724), who was ordained presbyterian minister of Convoy, County Donegal, in 1664; then moved to Omagh in 1677; left for Scotland in 1689, where he was successively minister of Dunscore, Drysdale, and New North Church, Edinburgh; and returning to Ireland in 1692, became minister of Ardstraw, where he continued till his death. Samuel, the son, was born in 1685, probably at Omagh, where his father was then minister. In 1701 he entered Glasgow College, enrolled among the students of the first class under John Loudon, professor of logic and rhetoric. He graduated M.A., and went to Leiden University to study theology (19 November 1705). In 1706 he was licensed at Rotterdam, and in 1708 received ordination at Geneva, choosing to be ordained there because of its tolerance. He now became chaplain to the Cameronian regiment, serving under the Duke of Marlborough in Flanders. He was received by the synod of Ulster in 1712 as an ordained minister without charge, and declared capable of being settled in any of its congregations. For some time, however, he lived in London, where he associated with the Whig faction, in and out of the government, and used his influence to promote the interests of his fellow-churchmen. He opposed the extension of the Schism Bill to Ireland. In 1718 he took a leading part in obtaining an increase in the regium donum; the synod of Ulster thanked him. Haliday introduced two historians, Laurence Echard and Edmund Calamy, in a London social meeting with Richard Ellys.Edmund Calamy, An Historical Account of My Own Life vol. 2, edited by John Towill Rutt (1829), p. 397;archive.org. In 1719 he was present at the Salters' Hall debates, and in the same year received a call from the first congregation of Belfast, vacant by the death of the Rev. John McBride. He was at this time chaplain to Colonel Anstruther's regiment of foot. It being rumoured that he held Arian views, the synod in June 1720 considered the matter, and cleared him. His accuser, the Rev. Samuel Dunlop of Athlone, was rebuked. On 28 July 1720, the day appointed for his installation in Belfast, he refused to subscribe the Westminster Confession of Faith, making instead a declaration to the presbytery; the presbytery proceeded with the installation, in violation of the law of the church, and in the face of a protest and appeal from four members. The case came before the synod in 1721; but though Haliday still refused to sign the Confession, the matter was allowed to drop. A resolution was, however, carried after long debate that all members of synod who were willing to subscribe the confession might do so, with which the majority complied. Hence arose the terms \\"subscribers\\" and \\"non-subscribers\\". Haliday continued identified with the latter till his death. A number of members of his congregation were so dissatisfied with the issue of the case that they refused to remain under his ministry. After much opposition they were erected by the synod into a new charge. The subscription controversy raged for years, Haliday continuing to take a major part in it, both in the synod and through the press. To end the conflict the synod in 1725 adopted the expedient of placing all the non- subscribing ministers in one presbytery, that of Antrim, which in the following year was excluded from the body. Haliday was a lifelong friend to Francis Hutcheson the philosopher.John Wilson Foster, Helena C. G. Chesney, Nature in Ireland: a scientific and cultural history (1998), p. 380; Google Books. In 1736 Thomas Drennan was installed as his colleague in Belfast. Haliday died on 5 March 1739 in his fifty-fourth year. Works In 1706, whilst at Leiden, Haliday published a theological Disputatio in Latin. The establishment of the seceded Belfast congregation called forth A Letter from the Revs. Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Haliday, Ministers in Belfast, to a Friend in Glasgow, with relation to the new Meeting-house in Belfast, Edinburgh, 1723. In 1724 he published Reasons against the Imposition of Subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith, or any such Human Tests of Orthodoxy, together with Answers to the Arguments for such Impositions, pp. xvi and 152, Belfast, 1724. A reply to this was issued by the Rev. Gilbert Kennedy of Tullylish, County Down, Haliday published A Letter to the Rev. Mr. Gilbert Kennedy, occasioned by some personal Reflections, Belfast, 1725, and in the following year A Letter to the Rev. Mr. Francis Iredell, occasioned by his ‚ÄúRemarks‚Äù on ‚ÄúA Letter to the Rev. Mr. Gilbert Kennedy,‚Äù Belfast, 1726. Haliday also published A Sermon occasioned by the Death of the Rev. Mr. Michael Bruce, preached at Holywood on 7 Dec. 1735, pp. 35, Belfast, 1735. A correspondence between him and the Rev. James Kirkpatrick of Belfast on the one side, and the Rev. Charles Mastertown, minister of the new congregation there, on the other, over a proposal that the two former and their congregations should communicate along with the hearers of the latter, is in the preface to Kirkpatrick's Scripture Plea, 1724. Family Haliday married the widow of Arthur Maxwell, who brought him property; the physician Alexander Henry Haliday was their son.

His didactic activity focused on themes of comparative Ecclesiastic Law and in particular, thanks to a number of stays at the University of Utrecht for study purposes, on Netherlands's legal system. These studies led to the publication of a monograph on the subject of the financial relations between State and religious groups in Netherlands. In those years he also carried out intensive didactic activities and a great trade union commitment which led him at the end of the eighties to fill for 8 years the post of SNUR-CGIL's General Secretary for the district of Florence.

Kekwick Professor Ralph Ambrose Kekwick (11 November 1908 Leytonstone Essex ‚Äì 17 January 2000 Woodford).J. Michael Creeth, Leon Vallet, and Winifred M. Watkins, \\"Ralph Ambrose Kekwick. 11 November 1908 ‚Äì 17 January 2000\\" Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society, 2002 48: 233‚Äì249 accessed 11 January 2012 was a British biochemist who did pioneering work on human plasma fractionation, including the first production of Factor VIII. Early life and education Ralph's father was Oliver A. Kekwick (1865‚Äì1939) a managing clerk in a firm of ships' chandlers in Royal Albert Dock, London. His mother was Mary E. Price (1868‚Äì1958) who, aged 13, was a pupil-teacher at Bromley St Leonard's Church school, Bromley-by-Bow, London. Ralph was the youngest of her three children. Ralph attended infants' and elementary schools in Leytonstone and in 1919 gained a scholarship to Leyton County High School for boys. His elder brother read chemistry at University College London (UCL) and his accounts of this excited Ralph and set him for a career in science. At age 16, Ralph passed the School Certificate sufficiently to make him eligible for university entrance and he began at UCL in 1925, a month before his 17th birthday. He obtained a BSc with first class in chemistry in 1928. Career 1920s UCL did not then run undergraduate courses in biochemistry but did have a small biochemistry department headed by Prof. Sir Jack Drummond (FRS 1944). In 1928 Drummond gave a series of open lectures which Kekwick attended and decided as a result to pursue a career in biochemistry. He stayed at UCL doing work which included the hydrogen-ion dissociation curve of the crystalline albumin of the hen's egg. 1930s In 1931 he was awarded a Commonwealth Fund Harkness Fellowship which enabled him to spend two years in the United States. He joined Keith Cannan and resumed work on egg albumin and later published two papers in the Biochemical Journal. He returned to UCL as a lecturer from 1933 to 1937, spending a year at the Physical Chemical Institute in Uppsala, Sweden from 1935 to 1937 doing work with Nobel laureate Theodor Svedberg on analytical ultracentrifugation. In 1935 a grant of ¬£3,400 to the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in London was made by the Rockefeller Foundation to acquire an oil turbine and equilibrium ultracentrifuge from the Swedish institute. A special building housed the equipment because of the closeness of the Thames and the need to protect other equipment from vibration. Kekwick assisted with the installation and in 1937 a Medical Research Council (MRC) grant supported him working at the Lister where he was offered a post. In 1938, Svedberg attended the opening of the new Lister Institute Biophysics Building. A steady flow of research papers based on ultracentrifugal measurements followed and in 1941, in recognition of his contributions to the physicochemical characterisation of proteins, Kekwick was awarded a DSc degree by London University of which the Lister was a part. In the summer of 1939 he left for the USA with his wife and daughter (born 1938) to visit his wife's family and attend the Third Microbiological Congress in New York during which war was declared in Europe. His wife and daughter stayed on with her family while he returned to the UK ‚Äì his wife and daughter did not return until 1944. 1940s On his return to the Lister he continued experiments on diphtheria antitoxic horse sera. In 1940, Sir Percival Hartley, head of the Medical Research Council Biological Standards Division, raised problems with serum and plasma for transfusion. On storage, sterile human serum developed a haze owing to liberation of lipid from serum lipoprotein. This was visually indistinguishable from bacterial contamination. A method was found to produce a clear, filterable, stable product. There was also a need for stocks of dried plasma or serum that could be reconstituted in emergencies. In 1941 Ralph moved to the unoccupied London County Council Serum Institute at Carshalton to avoid the London bombing. During 1942‚Äì43 the ether- freeze treatment of human serum and plasma was expanded and 1,000 litres of serum and 2,500 litres of plasma were produced and used clinically. More work was done on human plasma fractionation between 1944 and 1954. 1950s ‚Äì retirement An expanding demand for dried plasma and plasma protein fractions and a new blood products laboratory was built at the Elstree site. In 1952 Ralph was appointed Reader in Biophysics in the University of London. The first effective concentrate of human Factor VIII was produced and used successfully and reported in The Lancet in 1957. Kekwick received the Oliver Memorial Award for outstanding contributions to blood transfusion.(With P. Wolf ) A concentrate of human antihaemophilic factor, its use in six cases of haemophilia. R Kekwick, P Wolf The Lancet 1957 647‚Äì650 In 1966 Kekwick was given a personal Chair in the University of London and was elected a Fellow of The Royal Society (FRS). Personal life He met his future wife Barbara Stone, a graduate in English from Wells College, whilst in New York in the 1930s. They married in June 1933. He retired in 1971 as his wife was unwell following post-operative complications ‚Äì she died 18 months later. In 1974 he married his former colleague at the Lister, Margaret Mackay, who later died suddenly in 1982.

After the Tunisian Revolution in 2011, he was elected as a member of the Constituent Assembly.

Activism As an activist for human rights, Ayadi spent six and a half years in prison, five and a half in the wake of the process against the left-wing movement El Amal Ettounsi in 1974. Portrait d'Abderraouf Ayadi (Partistunisie.com) After his release from prison, Ayadi continued to be interrogated frequently, living under constant surveillance from the regime of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. ¬´ Abberraouf Ayadi succ√®de √† Moncef Marzouki √† la t√™te du CPR ¬ª, Leaders, 13 d√©cembre 2011 On 24 July 2001, Ayadi co-founded the Congress of the Republic (CPR) and was elected its vice-president. Ayadi participated in a 32-day hunger strike against Ben Ali's regime on 18 October 2005, the protesters then formed the 18 October Coalition for Rights and Freedoms. Political career After the Tunisian Revolution, he was named by his party, the Congress of the Republic (CPR), as its representative at the Higher Authority for Realisation of the Objectives of the Revolution, Political Reform and Democratic Transition In the 2011 Constituent Assembly election, Ayadi was elected to represent the district of La Manouba in the Constituent Assembly of Tunisia. After the election of CPR Secretary-General Moncef Marzouki as President of Tunisia, Ayadi moved up as leader of the CPR. His nomination was however disputed by some party members and the name of Tahar Hmila was shortly brought up. Finally, on 20 December 2011, the party officially named Ayadi the CPR's interim Secretary General, to be confirmed at the party's next congress, which however had to be delayed until June 2012. Following allegations that he had taken \\"positions contrary to the principles of the party and its decisions, without consultation with the political bureau\\", Ayadi on 19 April 2012 was dismissed from his official functions. Ayadi had lauded Samir Geagea's right-wing Lebanese Forces, whose Christian militia was responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre of hundreds of Palestinian refugees in 1982. Haythem Belgacem temporarily replaced Ayadi as secretary general of the CPR. Only a few days later, on 9 May 2012, Ayadi and a group of fellow partisans and members of the Constituent Assembly announced that they would leave the CPR and form a new party under the name of \\"Wafa\\" (meaning \\"faithful\\", used here in the sense of \\"faithful to the revolution\\").

In the 2014 parliamentary election, his new party however lost all its seats. On 19 December 2014 he however withdrew. Positions On 25 February 2012, Ayadi declared on Tunisian TV that the first President of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, had been \\"hostile to Arab culture and Islam\\". When in March 2012, the preamble of the new Tunisian Constitution was discussed, Ayadi supported Ennahda's proposal to keep intact Article 1 of the 1959 constitution describing the country as a republic with Arabic being its language and Islam its religion. Ayadi said: \\"As long as the identity of the country is Arab-Muslim, the article remains accurate and relevant.\\" The decision could potentially prevent the abuse of religion for political gains, he said: \\"Prophet Mohammed used politics for religion. Now we are afraid that some will use religion for politics ‚Äì especially when the goals aren‚Äôt always clear.\\" In May 2012, he declared that he would \\"respect and love\\" Adolf Hitler who had never done anything against the Arabs. He claimed that the situation for Tunisia had even improved with the German invasion during the Second World War. In January 2013, Ayadi supported the inscription of legal jihad into the Constitution of Tunisia, allegedly advocating the integration of jihadist fighters into the Tunisian Army. ¬´ Abderraouf Ayadi pour l'int√©gration des jihadistes au sein du minist√®re de la D√©fense ! ¬ª, Shems FM, 28 janvier 2013 This information was disclaimed by Wafa party officials on the next day. ¬´ Tunisie ‚Äì Wafa d√©ment que Abderraouf Ayadi ait propos√© d'int√©grer les jihadistes dans l'arm√©e nationale ¬ª, Business News, 28 janvier 2013 After the murder of left-wing leader Chokri Belaid, one of Ayadi's allies during the times as activists, http://protectionline.org/fr/2010/12/29/abderraouf-ayadi-chokri-belaid-et- abdelkader-ben-khemis-defenseurs-des-droits-de-l%C2%92homme-assaillis-et- sequestres/ on 6 February 2013, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali from the Islamist Ennahda party announced on 12 February that he would form a government of \\"national unity\\" which would consist of \\"apolitical technocrats.\\" Abderraouf Ayadi's Wafa party immediately criticized this proposal and stressed that a government which remains true to the values of the revolution should remain \\"political in nature.\\" On 20 November 2013 he proposed that a dialogue be started with the outlawed Islamist terror group Ansar al-Sharia.

Nomenclature  The Cuban oak was first described by Nuttall (1842) as Quercus sagraeana based on the specimen collected by Ram√≥n de la Sagra. Using the same specimen, but apparently unaware of the original name, Richard (1853) named the Cuban oak Q. cubana. Trelease (1924) did not view Q. sagraeana as a species in its own right but as a variety of Q. virginiana. He proposed the name Q. virginiana var. sagraeana. Muller (1961) renamed it Q. oleoides var. sagraeana, hypothesizing that the Cuban oak population was a subspecies of Q. oleoides, originating from the Yucat√°n region of Mexico, but with introgression from Q. geminata coming from Florida. He considered the morphologically variable Cuban population a hybrid swarm that had stabilized and was distinct from the other live oaks of the series Virentes. A recent study of molecular genetic variation and taxonomically informative leaf morphology shows that the Cuban oak shows little evidence of hybrid origin and is most similar to Q. virginiana, but distinct enough to be regarded as a separate species, Q. sagraeana.

The section requires courts to interpret both primary and subordinate legislation so that their provisions are compatible with the articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which are also part of the Human Rights Act 1998. This interpretation goes far beyond normal statutory interpretation, and includes past and future legislation, therefore preventing the Human Rights act from being impliedly repealed by subsequent contradictory legislation. Courts have applied section 3 of the Act through three forms of interpretation: \\"reading in\\" - inserting words where there are none in a statute; \\"reading out\\" where words are omitted from a statute; and \\"reading down\\" where a particular meaning is chosen to be in compliance. They do not interpret statutes to conflict with legislative intent, and courts have been reluctant in particular to \\"read out\\" provisions for this reason. If it is not possible to so interpret, they may issue a declaration of incompatibility under section 4. The relationship between sections 3 and 4 and parliamentary sovereignty has been commented on most extensively. The most common criticism has been of the implied limitations on legislative supremacy. Opponents of this criticism has questioned both its factual accuracy and its suggestion that the weakening of parliamentary sovereignty should be avoided. They instead cite morality and constitutionalism as among positive features of this change. The limits of courts' powers have also been queried. The retroactivity of law making is one criticism related to the rule of law, although the advancement of human rights is seen as a positive feature also associated with the rule of law. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague and there have been warnings of to the imposition of the judiciary on parliament's domain, these have also been challenged. Context Human rights are rights taken to be universal, of considerable importance, and relate to the individual and not collectively; among other things, they can grant freedoms, claims, immunities and powers. The European Convention on Human Rights was drawn up in the wake of the Second World War to uphold such rights. The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and accepted the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, in 1966. The Human Rights Act 1998 made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time. Excluded are Articles 1 and 13, which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself, and therefore were not relevant to rights enforced under it. The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law, and remains an Act of \\"fundamental constitutional importance\\". Provisions Diagram showing the interaction of sections 3, 4 and 10 of the Human Rights Act 1998 Section 3(1) states that \\"So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\\" Accordingly, a court must read any statute passed by parliament so as to uphold Convention rights, where this is possible. It is possibly the section of the act with the widest scope. The Human Rights Act therefore built upon a small number of previously recognised absolute freedoms which could only be expressly subjugated to another aim. This is different from other systems, such as the New Zealand Bill of Rights, that require an interpretation to be \\"reasonable\\". As happened in R (Anderson) v Home Secretary, the alternative where such interpretation is not possible the alternative is a declaration of incompatibility under Section 4. Lord Hoffmann in a case, R (Simms) v Home Secretary, which bridged the introduction of the Human Rights Act, said: > Parliamentary sovereignty means that Parliament can, if it chooses, > legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human > Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its > exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But the > principle of legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it > is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be > overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there is too great > a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have > passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express > language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore > presume that even the most general words were intended to be subject to the > basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United > Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply > principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in > countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a > constitutional document. \\"Read and give effect\\" requires the interpretation \\"where possible\\" of legislation - where there is an interpretation open to the court that is consistent with Convention rights, it must be chosen over those that do not. Following the introduction of the Human Rights Act, there was some disagreement between judges as to how far this provision went. Lord Steyn, in R v A, has said \\"the interpretative obligation under section 3 of the 1998 Act is a strong one. It applies even if there is no ambiguity in the language in the sense of the language being capable of two different meanings.\\" He further noted that it may be necessary under section 3 to \\"adopt an interpretation which linguistically may appear strained\\" and that a declaration of incomparability was a \\"measure of last resort\\". However, In re S established that there may be cases where interpretation can go too far; that the court can assume an administrative power it would not ordinarily have, with practical consequences that it is not best placed to consider: \\"a meaning which departs substantially from a fundamental feature of an Act of Parliament is likely to have crossed the boundary between interpretation and amendment.\\" Given that the precise wording of a statute could be altered under the section, the \\"thrust\\" was important; going against the \\"thrust\\" required legislative power that the courts did not have. Although other sources could be used (see, for example, Pepper v Hart), the wording of a statute must be considered the primary intent of parliament. The decision in Ghaidan v Godin- Mendoza appears to have achieved some settling of the approach taken in extreme cases. Section 3(2)(a) extends the scope of section 3 to past and future Acts of Parliament in addition to present legislation. It therefore contradicts the usual policy of implied repeal - whereby any inconsistency between statutes are resolved in favour of the later statute. The Human Rights Act must therefore be explicitly (or \\"expressly\\") repealed by an Act of Parliament deliberately doing so, not merely be introducing contradictory legislation. The act therefore carries an additional normative force and has been considered constitutional in character as a result. It is widely recognised that parliament may never directly contradict convention rights, or at least do so very rarely. Sections 3(2)(b) and 3(2)(c) confirm the validity of all legislation, whether or not it has been interpreted under Section 3. Section 3 can therefore be said to protect primary legislation which is incompatible, and any secondary legislation made under such primary legislation. Interpretation Three types of judicial interpretation are commonly identified in the context of section 3: \\"reading in\\", \\"reading out\\" and \\"reading down\\". \\"Reading in\\" refers to adding in words that are not present in the statute so as to ensure compliance with Convention rights, and \\"reading out\\" removing words in a statute to do so. These processes had already been implemented with reference to the implementation of European legislation, so as to ensure compliance of domestic law with European law. Although accepted with secondary legislation, they remain controversial with primary legislation, since parliament would have included or omitted such words if it had had such an intent; reading in or out words would therefore conflict with parliamentary intention. Courts have, however, accepted these powers, and during the passing of the Human Rights Act, it was agreed that the courts would have such a power. In R v A, extra provisions were read into a statute to ensure compliance, since the statute itself had the legitimate aim of protecting potential rape victims; it was merely, in the words of Lord Steyn, that \\"the methods adopted amounted to legislative overkill\\". In Poplar Housing v Donaghue, the Court of Appeal rejected the possibility of reading in a provision, because it would have altered the method of remedying the problem to that laid down by Parliament, amounting to starting afresh on how best to approach the issue. Courts have been far more reluctant to read out wording for fear of going against parliamentary intention, but it remains a possibility. \\"Reading down\\" involves choosing an interpretation that is compatible, where more than one is strictly possible. For example, placing a persuasive burden of proof on a defendant raising a defence - that he need persuade the jury that it is the case, was judged to be incompatible with Article 6(2) of the convention, which related to the presumption of innocence, which had long been a part of English law in R v Lambert. The court read down the burden of proof as merely one of an evidential burden - meaning the defendant merely had to raise some evidence to support the defence, which it believed did not conflict with Article 6(2). However, in Sheldrake v DPP, the court instead requiring a persuasive burden, because it believed in the context of the motoring offence in the case, this was not disproportionate and did not conflict with Article 6(2). Academic commentary Before the Human Rights Act was brought before parliament, the government's whitepaper considered that it was necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility (reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty). However, the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place. Section 3 has been defended, however, by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system, prompted by an \\"incoming tide\\" of human rights. Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty, but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area. She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming to the extent that the concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be \\"eliminated\\". However, other writers have stressed the importance of the formal right to ignore either decision. The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a \\"radical tool\\" to implement human rights, or a \\"significant limitation\\" of Parliament's will. Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a \\"deeply mysterious provision\\" in several respects, including judging how strong a provision it is - an issue since dealt with by the courts - but has also noted a disparity between what the Act might be expected to do and what it does. He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible - in other words, to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant. Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill to play a role in its interpretation. Philip Sales and Richard Ekins are among those that believe that section 3 has not displaced the purpose of interpretation - to discern parliamentary intention. In their eyes, section 3 is about \\"how interpreters are to infer that intention\\". They also criticise the \\"judicial lawmaking\\" because it applies to the case in hand, concluding that this breaks the non-retroactivity commonly considered part of the rule of law, although it is sometimes necessary. They also note that rules made by courts are not transparent, because their new interpretation under section 3 differs from their ordinary meaning - after all, section 3 must go beyond standard interpretation. This leaves citizens uncertain of what the law is. Sales and Ekins also suggest that while applying section 3 to post-Human Rights Act legislation might be merely using a presumption that the legislature intended to follow it, applying it to pre-Human Rights Act legislation cannot possibly base itself on such an inference. Section 3, though, still allows them to do so. Another view is that Section 3 provides a much strengthened basis for the sort of \\"weak review\\" - the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other - in a statutory form. There have been at least three criticisms put forward: firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament. Secondly, whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable; thirdly, if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent, section 3 may render section 4 necessary. However, judicial powers are probably not unconstrained. The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism, depending on the viewpoint. Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague, and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament, this viewpoint is controversial: they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there are rules emerging about the application of section 3.

The company designs, manufactures and markets laser systems and components, optics, and laser control and measurement, which are used in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing, industrial manufacturing, defense, space, and scientific research. History Founded in 1966 as Coherent Radiation Laboratories by Eugene Watson and a small group of scientists with $20,000 of startup capital. Watson, previously the sales and marketing manager at Spectra-Physics, was convinced of the commercial possibility for lasers in science and manufacturing. After having his proposal to build this business at Spectra-Physics rejected by the Board of Directors, he resigned and announced his intention to start a new venture to produce gas- ion and CO2 lasers. The founding team included physicist James Hobart, mechanical engineer Wayne Mefferd, laser scientist Steven Jarrett, and rounding out the team was Bob Rorden, an electronics engineer. This talented team of engineers and scientists is credited with creating some of the most successful commercial laser products in the history of the industry. Operating in Watson's Palo Alto home, the immediate need that Watson and his team faced was access to sufficient electrical power. A 220-volt outlet in the laundry room was repurposed and next to a washer and dryer, the first Coherent laser product was developed. Unveiled at the Westcon trade show just 4 months later, the first Coherent product was also the first commercially available carbon dioxide laser. Boeing Manufacturing Research Lab was the first Coherent customer. Watson himself undertook the installation in January 1967, and discovered the laser was working when a hole was burned in the customer's tweed jacket hanging on a door. The jacket was replaced by Coherent and, in the process, the first happy customer was acquired. With a new laser product on the market, Coherent developed the second product out of necessity, a power meter. Throughout the history of Coherent, laser measurement devices have been an integral part of the product portfolio. New laser types and a bewildering array of power and wavelength options, along with the addition of optics products, have given the company one of the most diversified catalogs in the industry. With capital from the Rockefeller Family (now Venrock Associates) providing necessary funding for that early growth, Coherent went public in 1970 and continued to grow. With a growing list of customers across the globe and new products that pushed the boundaries of lasers for science, medical, industrial, and electronics markets, Coherent was recognized as a leader in commercial lasers. A number of conditions created crisis in the 1980s, as commodity laser products inundated the market. Lasers are technically complex but relatively easy to develop, and with little startup capital required for a new entrant to produce lasers, competitors flourished. A number of self- inflicted problems plagued Coherent in this time period, the most threatening was a failed joint venture with General Electric that produced a profoundly flawed product that tarnished the Coherent brand image. The company failed to deliver on quality, delivery, and service promises and the company struggled financially. James Hobart was appointed to the CEO role in August of 1988. He restructured the business units and implemented sweeping improvement programs modeled on Japanese manufacturing. Just in Time (JIT), Statistical Process Control (SPC), and Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) manufacturing was implemented throughout the company, stressing quality and efficiency as core operating principles. By 1990 production output has increased 20% over 1987 with 30% fewer employees, product defect rates were halved, and 90% of deliveries were made on time. The 1990s were a period of growth and innovation at Coherent, and in just a two year period 34 new products were launched. Coherent acquired and occupied a new corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, CA, moving out of its historical home in Palo Alto. Efficiency and profits increased, fueling a period of global expansion and acquisitions. In July 1996, Bernard J. Couillaud was promoted from VP and General Manager of the Coherent Laser Group to President and Chief Executive Officer. Over the years, Coherent was involved in a number of mergers and acquisitions.Coherent, Inc. mergers and acquisitions. Alacrastore.com. In July 1995, Coherent acquired the laser diode operations of Uniphase Corporation. In December 1996, the company purchased 80% of Tutcore OY, Ltd., based in Tampere, Finland and ranked as the world's leading manufacturer of aluminum-free semiconductor wafers used in manufacturing laser diodes. Rofin-Sinar, O.R. Lasertechnologie, Dilas, Nufern and many more acquisitions have added to the product portfolio and technical talent that Coherent is globally recognized for. In April 2020, Coherent Inc. announced the appointment of Andy W. Mattes as its new President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.  The Bernard J. Couillaud Prize  The OSA Foundation and Coherent Inc. partnered in 2017 to offer the Bernard J. Couillaud Prize, awarded annually following a rigorous selection process. The Couillaud Prize honors the legacy of the former CEO of Coherent, Bernard J. Couillaud, who died unexpectedly in 2017. Couillaud, a brilliant physicist who in collaboration with Nobel Prize Laureate Theodor W. H√§nsch, developed the Hansch-Couillaud technique for laser frequency stabilization, was instrumental in the development of numerous Dye, DPSS, and Ti:Sapphire lasers in his various roles at Coherent, authored countless publications and received numerous patents before becoming CEO in 1996. He served as CEO until 2002, at which time he was named Chairman of the Board of Directors until his retirement in 2007. The Couillaud Prize is offered to early-career professionals pursuing compelling and innovative research in ultrafast lasers that offers the potential for positive impact on science. With an emphasis on solving difficult, real-world problems, the Couillaud Prize is a personal prize intended to help the young professional advance their research and commercial prospects. Consisting of two parts, the Couillaud Prize is a merit award of $20,500 with up to $5,000 in travel expense reimbursement to attend OSA scientific conferences.

It is designed to simplify logins for end users as well as provide more and more reliable demographic information to web developers.Social Login: A Data Capture Game Changer(accessed 21 December 2011). How social login works Social login links accounts from one or more social networking services to a website, typically using either a plug-in or a widget. By selecting the desired social networking service, the user simply uses his or her login for that service to sign on to the website. This, in turn, negates the need for the end user to remember login information for multiple electronic commerce and other websites while providing site owners with uniform demographic information as provided by the social networking service. Many sites which offer social login also offer more traditional online registration for those who either desire it or who do not have an account with a compatible social networking service (and therefore would be precluded from creating an account with the website).  Application  Social login can be implemented strictly as an authentication system using standards such as OpenID or SAML. For consumer websites that offer social functionality to users, social login is often implemented using the OAuth standard. OAuth is a secure authorization protocol which is commonly used in conjunction with authentication to grant 3rd party applications a \\"session token\\" allowing them to make API calls to providers on the user's behalf. Sites using the social login in this manner typically offer social features such as commenting, sharing, reactions and gamification. While social login can be extended to corporate websites,\\"Integrate Social Networks with your Corporate Website with Social Sign On\\" - Altimeter Group, September 27, 2010 the majority of social networks and consumer-based identity providers allow self-asserted identities. For this reason, social login is generally not used for strict, highly secure applications such as those in banking or health. Advantages of social login Studies have shown that website registration forms are inefficient as many people provide false data, forget their login information for the site or simply decline to register in the first place. A study conducted in 2011 by Janrain and Blue Research found that 77 percent of consumers favored social login as a means of authentication over more traditional online registration methods.Social Media Marketing: Social login or traditional website registration? MarketingSherpa, January 12, 2012 Additional benefits: * Targeted Content - Web sites can obtain a profile and social graph data in order to target personalized content to the user. This includes information such as name, email, hometown, interests, activities, and friends. However, this can create issues for privacy, and result in a narrowing of the variety of views and options available on the internet. * Multiple Identities - Users can log into websites with multiple social identities allowing them to better control their online identity.\\"The Social Web's Big New Theme for 2011: Multiple Identities for Everyone\\" - AllThingsD, January 1, 2011 * Registration Data - Many websites use the profile data returned from social login instead of having users manually enter their PII (Personally Identifiable Information) into web forms. This can potentially speed up the registration or sign-up process. * Pre-validated Email - Identity providers who support email such as Google and Yahoo! can return the user's email address to the 3rd party website preventing the user from supplying a fabricated email address during the registration process. * Account linking - Because social login can be used for authentication, many websites allow legacy users to link pre-existing site account with their social login account without forcing re-registration. Disadvantages of social login Utilizing social login through platforms such as Facebook may unintentionally render third-party websites useless within certain libraries, schools, or workplaces which block social networking services for productivity reasons. It can also cause difficulties in countries with active censorship regimes, such as China and its \\"Golden Shield Project,\\" where the third party website may not be actively censored, but is effectively blocked if a user's social login is blocked. There are several other risks that come with using social login tools. These logins are also a new frontier for fraud and account abuse as attackers use sophisticated means to hack these authentication mechanisms. This can result in an unwanted increase in fraudulent account creations, or worse; attackers successfully stealing social media account credentials from legitimate users. One such way that social media accounts are exploited is when users are enticed to download malicious browser extensions that request read and write permissions on all websites. These users are not aware that later on, typically a week or so after being installed, the extensions will then download some background Javascript malware from its command and control site to run on the user's browser. From then on, these malware infected browsers can effectively be controlled remotely. These extensions will then wait until the user logs into a social media or another online account, and using those tokens or credentials will sign up for other online accounts without the rightful user's express permission. Aggregating social login Social login applications compatible with many social networking services are available to web developers using blogging platforms such as WordPress. Companies such as Gigya, Janrain, Oneall.com, Lanoba.com, and LoginRadius also provide single solution social login services for web developers. These companies can provide social login access to 20 or more social network sites.List of Social Login Providers, Janrain Security In March 2012, a research paper reported an extensive study on the security of social login mechanisms. The authors found 8 serious logic flaws in high-profile ID providers and relying party websites, such as OpenID (including Google ID and PayPal Access), Facebook, Janrain, Freelancer, FarmVille, Sears.com, etc. Because the researchers informed ID providers and the third party websites that relied on the service prior to public announcement of the discovery of the flaws, the vulnerabilities were corrected, and there have been no security breaches reported.\\"OpenID: Vulnerability report, Data confusion\\" - OpenID Foundation, March 14, 2012 This research concludes that the overall security quality of SSO deployments seems worrisome. Moreover, social logins are often implemented in an insecure way. Users, in this case, have to trust every application which implemented this feature to handle their identifier confidentially. \\"Social Login Setups ‚Äì The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" - CloudRail, August 2, 2016 Furthermore, by placing reliance on an account which is operable on many websites, social login creates a single point of failure, thus considerably augmenting the damage that would be caused were the account to be hacked.

The destroyers were built in two types the large destroyers and the small destroyers. The large destroyers were the largest and fastest in the world at that time. Starting with the Chacal class in the 1920s, France produced a series of six classes of large destroyers, known in French as contre-torpilleurs, that were designed to sink opposing cruisers by catching them with superior speed and then with their torpedoes. They were intended to drive off opposing destroyers with superior firepower. Many considered the Fantasque class to be the epitome of this super destroyer concept. The last class, the Mogador class, was less successful due to the higher penalties in building cost, running cost, and reliability. The smaller destroyers built in the 1920s were found to be lacking in speed and seakeeping. The first two classes had top speeds of 28 to 29 knots that were insufficient to keep up with the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships that were being built in the late 1920s. The Hardi class of 1932 was designed to have a 37 knot top end. The emphasis on the large destroyers and the long time of construction led to a deficit of numbers in destroyer strength in the French Navy. To balance the Italian threat, the 600-ton La Melpom√©ne La Melpom√©ne class class was a group of 13 French torpedo boats built in 1933. It was designed along the lines of the Italian torpedo boats of that time, but due to its size and speed of 34.5 knots, the class is considered a light destroyer, or destroyer escort.

Bahrain security forces launched a pre-dawn raid to clear Pearl Roundabout in Manama of the protesters camped there, most of whom were at the time asleep in tents; four were killed and about 300 injured. The event led some to demand even more political reform than they had been before, calling for an end to the reign of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The clearance was described by witnesses as being brutal and sudden. Clouds of tear gas covered the area, and volleys of birdshot were fired on those who refused to withdraw. Medics, ambulances and a journalist were reportedly attacked as well. Sporadic clashes broke out around Bahrain hours after the raid. During the afternoon the National Guard and army deployed armoured vehicles, tanks, more than 50 armoured personnel carriers and set up checkpoints in the streets around the country. Protesters then took refuge at Salmaniya Medical Complex and continued their agitations; thousands of them chanted \\"Down with the king, down with the government.\\" The government accused protesters of attacking the security forces, 50 of whom sustained injuries, and insisted that action had been necessary to pull Bahrain back from the \\"brink of a sectarian abyss\\". But opposition parties dismissed the government's account as a \\"silly play\\", described the raid as a \\"heinous massacre\\" and submitted their resignations from the lower house of Parliament. Internationally, the Gulf Cooperation Council Ministers of Foreign Affairs expressed their solidarity with government of Bahrain and their support for the measures taken. The United Nations, the European Union and the United States on the other hand expressed their deep concern and regret for the violence used against protesters. The United Kingdom government announced that in light of the unrest it would revoke some arms export licences to Bahrain. A number of international rights groups and independent observers criticised the government crackdown. Background Protesters gathering at Pearl Roundabout for the first time on 15 February. Police retreated from Pearl Roundabout to the northern area close to Bahrain City Centre The events were one of a string of protests that occurred across the Arab world following the self-immolation and eventual death of Mohammed Bouazizi in Tunisia, the majority Shia population of Bahrain, as well as some Sunni Muslims, took to the streets demanding reforms. Al Jazeera reported that a protest was planned for 14 February, just a few months after the controversial 2010 election. On 14 February (referred to as Day of Rage by protest organisers), about 6,000 people took part in many protests around Bahrain demanding the release of previously detained protesters, socio-economic justice, political reform and a constitutional monarchy. Police then attacked the protesters throughout the day, using tear gas, rubber bullets and shotguns, inflicting many injuries and causing the hospitalisation of four demonstrators. In the evening, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds to his back at close range. The next day, thousands of mourners attended his funeral. During the ceremony police shot Fadhel Al-Matrook in the back at close range; he died from his wounds within an hour. People were then allowed to march to and occupy Pearl Roundabout, where they began to set up tents; the number of demonstrators had swelled to 10,000 people by nightfall. King Hamad offered his condolences for the two deaths and announced the establishment of a committee to investigate the events of the previous two days. In total, 25 people were said to have been injured on 15 February. By 16 February, Pearl Roundabout was still occupied by thousands of protesters. Some of those present at the scene described the mood at the roundabout as \\"festive,\\" with protesters distributing tea, coffee and food while discussing the situation in the country. Opposition political figures such as Ali Salman and Abdulwahab Hussain also addressed the crowds gathered at the roundabout. Elsewhere in the country a funeral procession was held for Fadhel Al-Matrook, while a motorcade of about 100 cars with supporters of King Hamad passed without police interference. The Ministry of Interior then announced that the gathering at Pearl Roundabout was illegal and that it was only tolerated as a display of sympathy in the wake of recent events. King Hamad visited the Bahrain Defence Force headquarters, where he met its Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Khalifa bin Ahmad and other senior military officers. Together they reviewed \\"the preparations undertaken by the Defence Force to protect the security of the homeland and to maintain the safety of citizens.\\" Naming In Bahrain, especially among the organising activists, the day police stormed the roundabout was posthumously referred to as Bahrain Bloody Thursday; some doctors also referred to it as Black Thursday; while other opposition members have called it a massacre. Raid Three out of four police units deployed in Manama entered Pearl Roundabout from several points and pushed protesters away from it In a pre-dawn raid, at about 3:00 on 17 February, around 1,000 police were dispatched to clear the Pearl Roundabout of an estimated 1,500‚Äì3,000 individuals staying overnight in tents. According to the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, police were armed with sticks, shields, sound bombs, tear gas and shotguns. They moved on protesters from two directions, the flyover north of Pearl Roundabout and Noaim, south of the roundabout. In addition, personnel from NSA and BDF were onsite. Eyewitness and journalist accounts According to eyewitnesses, the raid was sudden and without warning and many sleeping protesters, including women and children, were awoken by the sounds of tear gas and stun grenades. Armed plainclothes policemen arrived in more than 100 civilian cars and started breaking into tents before the uniformed officers started shooting. The police carried knives, which they used to slice through tents, before beating women and men inside and firing on some people with bird-shot shotguns. Clouds of tear gas covered Pearl Roundabout that \\"one could not see surroundings,\\" according to one witness. Maryam Alkhawaja of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights said: \\"The attack was very violent, [the police] were not showing any mercy.\\" An unnamed injured protester told the local independent newspaper Al-Wasat he was within a group of protesters who were awake and that they chanted \\"peaceful ... peaceful\\" before being attacked by police who reportedly stole his wallet, camera and mobile phone after beating and dragging him with a rope. Another injured protester described how women and children were running all over the place; even after withdrawing to nearby villages, police still pursued protesters and arrested \\"large numbers\\" of them. Other eyewitnesses said police searched the cars parked around Pearl Roundabout, damaging some of them. Yet another injured protesters said: \\"They had encircled us and they kept shooting tear gas and live rounds. The circle got closer and closer.\\" Some witnesses claimed the police used anti-Shia curses during their attacks on the mainly Shia protesters. Medics who arrived at Pearl Roundabout said they saw police stamping on handcuffed protesters who laid on the ground. A nurse said she saw a group of police \\"execute\\" a young protester with a gun at \\"point-blank range\\" after handcuffing and beating him. Five ambulances arrived at Pearl Roundabout ABC News reporter Miguel Marquez said he was beaten by men carrying clubs while he was making a phone call report. \\"There was a canister that looked like ‚Äì No! No! No! Hey! I'm a journalist here! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! ... I'm hit.\\" Then, in an attempt to show he was not a protester, Marquez yelled \\"Journalist, journalist!,\\" yet he reported getting hit multiple times and that his camera was stolen. He described the plainclothes police who reportedly attacked him as a \\"gang of thugs,\\" who wanted to clear the square before planned protests following Friday prayers. Health worker accounts A medical volunteer said that despite showing their identification cards police attacked ten medics at the roundabout who had offered their services. For eight hours Health Minister Faisal al-Hamar prevented ambulances going to the assistance of those injured at Pearl Roundabout. Doctors and paramedics protested inside Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC); while still doing their best to help the wounded, medics signed a petition and formed a human chain calling for his resignation for \\"blocking ambulances from going to help those injured in Pearl Roundabout.\\" They claimed that he told doctors at the hospital of his resignation before leaving. However, he later rejected that claim. Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's disaster plan was activated on the morning of the attack. It called for more than a dozen ambulances to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen ambulances were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that ambulances were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00 am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two ambulances to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more ambulances were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout. About five ambulances reached Pearl Roundabout, where they were confronted by police and army forces; three drivers and nine paramedics were attacked. One of the injured drivers claimed that police had clubbed him and that a senior officer had told him: \\"If I see you again, I'll kill you.\\" Another ambulance driver, who was unharmed, said that police removed injured protesters from his vehicle by force and a military officer ‚Äì whom he believed to be a Saudi, based on his Arabic dialect ‚Äì held a gun to his head and warned him to drive away or be shot. One ambulance was reportedly confiscated by police, who then took it to an unknown location after beating its driver and other paramedics, who had to walk back to the SMC. A paramedic also said police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, but when the ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: \\"Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics as long as they can. Security forces dealt with us as if we were defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we were doing was a professional and humane duty that has nothing to do with our political position.\\" When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived. Government accounts The government account of the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained in defiance of the law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site. On a state television show, Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Al-Hassan said that fifty police officers had been injured, including two with serious sword wounds and that \\"one protester drove over police resulting in injuries including cutting-off fingers of a policeman before we could catch him.\\" He also denied policemen prevented ambulances from reaching Pearl Roundabout or attacked any paramedics, but instead: \\"What happened is that protesters stole an ambulance car, so we were checking on every ambulance that reaches the roundabout.\\" One doctor working at SMC's ER supported the government's account, accusing protesters of attacking the Under-Secretary-of-State for Health, taking control of all hospital entrances and stealing an ambulance. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, set up by the king to report on the events of February and March, did not see any evidence to support the government's claim that protesters were armed or that medics had supplied them with weapons, however it stated that medics took control of the first floor of Salmaniya hospital. Eyewitnesses also denied being warned by the police, saying that if they had known of the police presence then women and children would have been evacuated. Aftermath Pearl Roundabout in the morning of the raid Army checkpoint near Pearl Roundabout Protesters gathering at Salmaniya hospital car parks The raid culminated in the destruction of the encampment, with flattened tents and protesters' belongings scattered all over the place. Security forces then declared the protest camp to be illegal and installed barbed wire around Pearl Roundabout. An hour after the attack, a number of protesters tried to return to the roundabout, which was completely controlled by police. Security forces fired a shotgun on one protester directly in the head from a few centimetres away, killing him instantly. Police claimed the protesters attacked them using \\"metal rods, swords, molotov cocktails, stones, and other weapons.\\" After some more time around 500 protesters gathered in the Noaim area, but were dispersed by police. Sporadic clashes broke out around Bahrain hours after the raid. During the afternoon, the National Guard deployed eight armoured vehicles and the Bahrain Defence Force deployed tanks and at least 50 armoured personnel carriers armed with machine guns around the capital, Manama, the first time military armoured vehicles had been seen in the streets since the protests commenced. Military checkpoints were set up and patrols circulated throughout the country. The Interior Ministry issued a warning to citizens to stay out of the streets; while the army warned people that they were ready to take \\"punitive measures\\" to restore order. The Bahrain Defence Force issued Statement 1, which asked citizens to \\"distance themselves from gatherings in vital areas in the capital [to prevent] fear, shock and serious traffic disruptions.\\" Main roads leading to Manama were blocked and traffic was also redirected, while main roads of the capital were almost empty, as workers stayed home, leaving banks and \\"other key institutions\\" closed. Salmaniya hospital According to an unnamed Al Jazeera reporter, hospitals in Manama were full because of patients that were awaiting treatment as a result of and during the police raid, including medical personnel who were attacked by police while trying to help the wounded. The New York Times columnist Nicolas Kristof reported that \\"hospital corridors were also full of frantic mothers searching desperately for children who had gone missing in the attack.\\" Women's cries were evident in the hospital and some fainted. The Minister of Health appeared on state television and claimed that the situation at the main hospital was calm and that there were only seven minor injuries. The blood bank at SMC called for blood donations, while the U.S. missionary hospital announced that it will be treating those injured for free. An eyewitness at the hospital said: \\"Lots of people are standing at the gates of the hospital. The police have closed the area so that no people can get in or out ‚Äì some tried to get out and were shot at by police.\\" The SMC was seen as a safe place for the opposition protesters to go. By late afternoon, about 4,000 protesters had congregated at the hospital, while protesters who had gathered in the car parks near the emergency entrance chanted: \\"Down with the regime, with our blood we will defend our rights.\\" After seeing the violence, Ali al-Ghanmi, a police officer, left his guard post and joined the crowd, announcing to them that he could no longer support \\"a killer institution.\\" The crowd hoisted him on their shoulders and al-Ghanmi became an immediate \\"mini-celebrity\\" of the protest movement. Casualties Plastic surgeon Sadiq Alekry giving a speech, two weeks after his injury More than 300 individuals were injured during the raid, including women and children; some of them in critical condition. Injured protesters were taken to the Salmaniya Medical Complex, many of them with broken limbs and open wounds. Four individuals were killed by police using shotguns, from close range. While two of them who were shot in the back, another protester was shot in the thigh and subsequently died at the SMC; the fourth was shot in the head later and died instantly. At least 25,000 mourners took part at the funeral procession, which was held in Sitra on 18 February for the three protesters originating from the island. ;Dr Sadiq Alekry Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily offered his services at the roundabout on the evening of 16 February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and cut through it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head and other parts of the body. About 20 officers then marched him away from Pearl Roundabout. Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged his left eye so badly in the process that he temporarily lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where his pants were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the threat was not carried out. In the bus, Alekry's shirt was pulled over his head and, while he was still hand-cuffed, security officers continued kicking and beating him for about an hour, until he fell to the floor. Nevertheless, the beating continued and Alekry reported that a police officer told him: \\"If you bleed in my chair with your dirty blood I will beat you to death!\\" When an ambulance arrived, police allowed him and three other detainees to be taken to hospital. He arrived at the SMC at 6:00 am, with severe injuries to his back, chest and face and underwent facial surgery a few days later. Deaths ;Ali Ahmed Moumen Portrait in memorial of Ali Moumen Ali Ahmed Moumen was a 22-year-old college senior who died at the SMC on 17 February after being shot by a police in the thigh. His death certificate indicated he died due to \\"extensive bleeding leading to intractable hypovolemic shock.\\" Hours before his death he had posted a \\"status\\" update on Facebook saying: \\"My blood is sacrificed for my country.\\" That night, Moumen was sleeping beside his younger brother and made it out of Pearl Roundabout safely, but, according to his father, was then killed when he tried to return after hearing women and children were trapped. One of his friends said Ali was \\"shot in the street and merely left to die.\\" Moumen was picked up at around 8:30 from Pearl Roundabout. He had serious injuries to his pelvis and right thigh. Bleeding profusely, two paramedics found Moumen after police allowed them through. The paramedics reported that they saw another possibly dead body with a fractured skull close to Moumen's, but were not permitted to pick it up. While leaving, the ambulance was reportedly attacked by riot police who beat the driver before allowing them to continue to the SMC. At the emergency room, Moumen had a surgery, but he died at 9:30. His father called Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa a \\"killer\\" and blamed him for his son's death. An unnamed policeman who charged with the murder of Moumen was acquitted on 27 September 2012. ;Ali Mansoor Khudair Ali Mansour Ahmed Khudair was a 53 or 58-year-old Bahraini who died on 17 February after police shot at his back. He had 91 pellets in his chest. Khudair was a fisherman from Sitra who lived in a ramshackle house. He had three sons: Hassan (21), Jaffar (14) and Ahmed (9), as well as an 18-year-old daughter. Jaffar said: \\"I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, when I woke up, I started moving away, but my father told me to endure, stay and not fear. Then we heard screams and rushed there. For a few seconds he spoke to the security forces, asking them to stay away from women and children, but they shot him in the chest. He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place.\\" ;Mahmood Makki Abutaki Mahmoud Makki Abutaki was a 22-year-old college student majoring in engineering, when he died on 17 February after being shot in the back by police. Medics pulled about 200 pellets of birdshot from his chest and arms. Abutaki's elder brother, Ahmed, who was in the morgue while holding his brothers' hands, recalled the last conversation they had the previous night for the media present: \\"He said, 'This is my chance, to have a say, so that maybe our country will do something for us.' My country did do something; it killed him.\\" ;Isa Abdulhasan Ali Hussain Isa Abdulhasan Ali Hussain was a 60-year-old Bahraini who died on 17 February morning immediately after riot police fired at his head from point- blank range. Hussain was a part of a group of protesters who marched back towards Pearl Roundabout after being dispersed when police shot him. Eyewitnesses say he went near security forces asking them to allow young people help the injured protesters. However, police claimed he was with a group of protesters who attacked them using metal rods, swords, molotov cocktails, stones and other weapons. His funeral was held on 18 February in Karzakan and was attended by thousands of mourners. An unnamed policeman charged with his murder was acquitted on 27 September 2012. Responses Domestic ;Executive King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa praised the concluding statement from the meeting of the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf foreign ministers, which was held on 17 February in Manama, and offered \\"full support\\" for Bahrain's security and politically, economically and defensively. At a news conference, Foreign Minister Khalid ibn Ahmad Al Khalifah alleged, and expressed his surprise, that protesters had attacked police. When asked about the reasons for choosing a pre-dawn time for the raid, he said: \\"The reason for choosing this time was the smaller number of participants, and this reduces injuries.\\" He called the deaths of the three protestors during the raid a \\"regrettable accident. Police action was necessary to pull Bahrain back from the brink of a sectarian abyss.\\" During the press conference, which was broadcasting live on national television, Al- Wasat correspondent Reem Khalifa cried tears and described what happened as a \\"real massacre.\\" In what Al-Wasat called \\"an unexpected move,\\" Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa appeared on state-owned television to express his condolences to the people for the \\"hard days\\" and asked them to \\"calm down.\\" He offered open dialogue with political societies, shortly before a royal decree was issued by his father, King Hamad, commissioning Salman to lead the dialogue. ;Legislative All 18 MPs from Al Wefaq, the only opposition political party represented in parliament, submitted their resignations. They announced that the investigation committee formed by the king to fact-find the issues into the previous two killing incidents was only for media consumption, more so in the light of the deaths of four more protesters. They said the extraordinary session of parliament was illegal according to its rules of procedure. Al Wefaq described the government account as a \\"silly play that wasn't even as good as the previously exposed plays.\\" It considered the report, which published photographs of firearms, swords and daggers, as \\"funny\\" and that these tools were not commercially sold in Bahrain. Ali Salman, the head of Al Wefaq, said the party would continue to demand reform. Abdul Jalil Khalil, an Al Wefaq member of parliament, described the raid as \\"real terrorism. Whoever took the decision to attack the protest was aiming to kill.\\" He also said the casualty number is proportially large given the small size of Bahrain's population and added: \\"After what happened today, people are asking us to leave parliament. Quit the government.\\" Other Al Wefaq MP's and lawyers made a criminal complaint against senior officials of the Ministry of Interior, including its minister, the agents, the commander of public security forces, his assistants and the various heads of security zones. ;Political Seven opposition political parties, including Al Wefaq and the National Democratic Action Society, issued a joint statement rejecting the government's charge that the demonstrators were armed and condemning \\"the heinous massacre\\" perpetrated by police, including the prevention of ambulances from reaching the site to ferry the wounded to hospital. They demanded the resignation of the government and the formation of a new one to investigate the \\"crime\\" and submit political reforms. Ibrahim Sharif, the head of National Democratic Action Society and a Sunni Muslim, said protesters were not given enough time to evacuate the area and that government could have told them hours before or even by small papers thrown from helicopters. He told the BBC that \\"throughout the day there were rumours we would have another 24 hours, but the attack has come without [any] warning.\\" ;Other The General Federation of Workers Trade Unions in Bahrain condemned the use of force in breaking up the peaceful gathering at Pearl Roundabout and asked King Hamad to intervene to stop security forces' violence and to punish those responsible for the incidents. They also announced that a meeting of the Central Council and heads of other trade unions is in the state of permanent session to take any deemed necessary steps, including the call for a general strike. The Bahrain Teachers' Society called for a strike and gatherings outside schools on 20 February. The Bahrain Human Rights Society and 18 other civil society foundations condemned the \\"sudden brutal attack\\" and asked other international and Arab figures to condemn it. Ayatollah Isa Qassim, Bahrain's highest-ranking Shia cleric, described the incident as a \\"massacre\\" in Friday sermon's Khutbah: \\"This reckless murder, and thirst to kill would create a complete break between the government and the people, and it will not allow any chance of any vote aiming to calm the situation and heal the wounds.\\" A group of clerics including the head of the Olama council visited the wounded at the SMC and spoke of their support for the protesters' demands and also called for immediate political reforms. The Olama council described the raid as a \\"terrible crime and at least a massacre\\" and asked for immediate urgent initiatives to achieve the \\"just demands of the people. We refuse blank prosthetic solutions, the practice of wasting time, and referral to the powerless Parliament that lacks popular legitimacy.\\" Doctors, nurses and paramedics organised a sit-in at the parks of the SMC demanding the resignation of the health minister and condemning the blocking of ambulances from going to Pearl Roundabout. The Bahrain Medical Society and Bahrain Dental Society issued a joint statement denouncing the \\"unjustified and excessive use of force by police, and the banning of medical teams from performing their duties\\" and asked the king to take immediate action to stop these procedures from re-occurring. International ;Supranational bodies The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asked for bringing to justice those responsible for the violence. He expressed his deep concern and disturbance \\"by the violent means used to disperse demonstrators.\\" A spokesperson for Catherine Ashton, the European Union's High Representative, said that she was very concerned about the events that took place and that she expressed regret for the deaths and acts of violence, while also calling on the Bahraini government to respect and protect the basic rights of its citizens including the right to assemble peacefully. \\"Concerns expressed by the people must be addressed peacefully through dialogue.\\" ;States French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Christine Valle expressed regret for the excessive use of force in several Arab countries and serious concern about the recent developments in Bahrain, as well as Libya and Yemen, in particular. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle condemned the use of violence by the police and called on officials in Bahrain to stop the use of violence immediately and protect the protesters better. \\"They [protestors] are just exercising their rights.\\" Saudi Arabian prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz, father of prince Al Waleed Bin Talal, said there is a chance protests in Bahrain would move into Saudi Arabia if serious reforms were not carried out. United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan expressed his country's support for Bahrain, stressing that what affects Bahrain and its security would affect the entire Gulf Cooperation Council and ultimately all countries of the world. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary William Hague said that he was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the \\"unacceptable violence\\" used against protesters. He also stressed the \\"need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters\\" to his Bahraini counterpart. The U.K. government then announced that in light of the unrest it has decided to revoke some arms export licenses to Bahrain stating that \\"licenses will not be issued when officials judge that there is a risk that the exports may provoke regional or internal conflicts or be used to facilitate internal repression.\\" However, arms sales continued throughout the year. The British Foreign Office also temporarily closed its embassy in Bahrain. United States President Barack Obama expressed his objection the use of the violence by the Bahraini government against peaceful demonstrators. White House spokesman Jay Carney said that it was \\"not an appropriate reaction\\" to use force against the protesters. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called Bahrain's foreign minister during the day to convey \\"our deep concern about the actions of the security forces.\\" The Pentagon's spokesman said that they were keeping a close look at developments in Bahrain and called on all parties to \\"exercise restraint and refrain from violence.\\" Jennifer Stride, the Bahrain-based U.S. Fifth Fleet's spokeswoman, said there was no \\"indication the protests will cause significant disruption\\" for the fleet, which she also said was \\"not being targeted.\\" ;Other Bernie Ecclestone, the F1 commercial rights holder, said if the unrest has \\"not quietened down by Wednesday, I think we will have to cancel the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix probably.\\" On 21 February the race was postponed and then canceled later. Human Rights Watch called on the Bahraini government to stop attacking peaceful protesters and start probes into the deaths. Amnesty International similarly condemned the government crackdown and asked for an independent investigation into the events. Anonymous, an online hackers grouping, issued a statement condemning the crackdown and expressed its solidarity with the protesters: \\"By interfering with the freedom to hold peaceful protests, the Bahrainian government has made itself a clear enemy of its own citizens and of Anonymous. The actions of this regime will not be forgotten, nor will they be forgiven.\\" The New York Times columnist Nicolas Kristof described the raid as \\"brutal repression\\" that is usually \\"confined to remote and backward nations\\" and referred to the government's version of events as \\"preposterous\\" and expressed his sadness over the events. Fareed Zakaria, CNNs international affairs analyst, said that the crackdown on the protesters was a \\"rash move that will enrage many of its people and cost the regime international prestige. This is a terrible mistake and they will pay a heavy price for it. The regime in Bahrain is doing something very rash and unwise; it is trying to respond by using force and punitive measures. This is not going to work in the end.\\" Analysis The events at the Pearl Roundabout and Salmaniyya Medical Complex marked a turning point in the Bahraini uprising, according to the media; an analysis by The Guardian said it reduced, if not killed, any chance of dialogue. The raid expanded the demands of some protesters from asking for reforms which included writing a new constitution to calling for an end to the monarchy. According to the Bahrain Mirror, the phrase \\"after Thursday, we stopped the talking; the people want to overthrow the regime\\" (Arabic: ŸÖŸÜ ÿ®ÿπÿØ ÿßŸÑÿÆŸÖŸäÿ≥ ÿ£ŸÜŸáŸäŸÜÿß ÿßŸÑŸÉŸÑÿßŸÖÿå ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿπÿ® Ÿäÿ±ŸäÿØ ÿ•ÿ≥ŸÇÿßÿ∑ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ∏ÿßŸÖ) became popular in later protests. On 22 February, a mass rally dubbed the March of loyalty to martyrs was held in honour of the four protesters who had lost their lives during the day; over 100,000 people took part in the protest. The Al Jazeera English documentary Bahrain: Shouting in the Dark also features the events of the day.

Six people, including two women (one of whom was pregnant) and four young children, were trapped inside the house and killed. Gerald Lewis, who escaped the fire with his three-year-old son, was initially charged with arson, manslaughter, and six counts of first-degree murder, the last of which could have garnered a death sentence. After a large- scale recreation was staged in an abandoned house near the original site, it was proven that accelerant was not necessary to create long-believed classic signs of arson such as pour patterns. Lewis was cleared of all charges, and the Lime Street fire has since become a seminal case in contemporary fire investigation. The podcast Criminal produced an episode about the fire and subsequent investigation, \\"527 Lime Street.\\" Original fire In the early hours of October 16, 1990, a fire broke out at the residence located at 527 Lime Street in downtown Jacksonville, Florida. The two-story, wood-framed house quickly became engulfed in flames. Eight people were inside the house when the fire began. When the first officer arrived, he found 35-year-old Gerald Wayne Lewis standing in the front yard, holding his young son Geramiah; six people‚Äîincluding Lewis' wife, her pregnant sister, and the sister's four young children‚Äîremained trapped inside. Investigation John Lentini, a private fire investigator with Applied Technical Services of Marietta, Georgia, was asked by the prosecution to investigate the manner of the fire in order to prove Lewis' guilt. Lentini initially reviewed the chemical analysis conducted by a Florida Fire Marshal's chemist, and found his determination of gasoline to be incorrect. Prosecutors then asked for a detailed examination of the findings of the Jacksonville fire investigator, Ray Powell. Lentini suggested recreating the fire. Wanting to stage a faithful recreation, he gained permission to set fire to a condemned house next door to the one that had burned down. The second house was nearly identical to the original, having been built at the same time by the same builder, with an identical floor plan. Lentini and his associates carefully staged the house in order to recreate the original house's furnishings; they \\"obtained a duplicate of the couch where the defendant said the fire started\\", \\"resurfaced the entire living room and hallway with the same 3/8\\" sheetrock found in the suspect's house\\", \\"carpeted with the same kind of carpet, wallpapered the living room walls, and used curtains of a similar type.\\" The team set fire to the couch, without the use of accelerant. Despite their belief that it would take 15 to 20 minutes for flashover to occur, the house became engulfed in flames in only four minutes. After the blaze died down, investigators noted the remains bore similarities to what was present after the original fire. Streaks on the floor called \\"pour patterns\\", which were often used as proof of accelerant usage, were seen in the second house as well. Lentini was scheduled to give testimony on behalf of the prosecution. However, after coming to the conclusion that similar conditions were caused in nearly identical fires, arson by way of accelerant could not be proven. Lentini would later state that he was changed by this discovery: \\"I had come within 24 hours of giving testimony that could well have sent an innocent person to Florida's electric chair. Needless to say, I was chastened by the experience. My professional life was never the same again.\\" Lentini created a one-hour video describing his investigations and the lessons learned.http://www.firescientist.com Legacy The fire and resulting investigation has been credited with changing the way arson investigations are held. The case was used as a precedent in the Australian acquittal on appeals of a person previously convicted of arson. Footnotes References Works cited   General references *Grann, David.

Together with his friend and business partner John Acland, he was the first to use the Canterbury high country for sheep farming. Early life Tripp was born in Kentisbeare, Mid Devon, England in 1826. His parents were the rector Rev. Charles Tripp and Frances Tripp (n√©e Owen). He received his education at the Merchant Taylors' School in London before studying law. He was called to the bar on 30 April 1853 and introduced his friend, John Acland, to members of the Canterbury Association, who proposed the organised settlement of Canterbury in New Zealand with Anglican ideals; introductions included those to James FitzGerald and John Robert Godley. Acland also worked in law. Sheep farming The Orari Gorge homestead in ca 1906 Acland and Tripp gave up their profession and emigrated to New Zealand in 1854 in the Royal Stuart to become sheep farmers. They arrived in Lyttelton on 4 January 1855. Both needed to obtain experience first and thus worked as cadets on established runs; Acland gained experience under Henry Tancred, whilst Tripp worked in Halswell and for one of the Brittan brothers. On 30 July 1855, they applied for land in the foothills in an area that was unexplored and their choice was guesswork; all the suitable land on the Canterbury Plains had been taken up already. Established runholders did not take them seriously, and some laughed at them for wanting to take up high country land, but Acland's attitude was that \\"in the Colonies you always like to see for yourself, and the worse account you hear of unoccupied country, the greater the reason for going to look at it.\\" In the spring and summer of 1855/56, they started exploring the area. Both had ¬£2,000 of capital, which was insufficient to buy an established station. They took up land including Mount Somers, Mount Possession, Mount Peel, Orari Gorge and parts of Hakatere and Mesopotamia, and were the first who put sheep in the high country. The first station they worked on was Mount Peel from May 1856, and while they prepared the run, they left their sheep with Dr Moorhouse, a brother of William Sefton Moorhouse, on the other side of the Rangitata River. Their partnership was dissolved in October 1862, and Tripp retained Orari Gorge and Mount Somers. Family In 1858, Charles Tripp married Ellen Shephard Harper, the third daughter of Bishop Harper. In the same ceremony, the Bishop's second daughter, Mary Anna Harper, married Charles Blakiston. The Tripps went to Akaroa for their honeymoon, riding there on horseback. On 17 January 1860, Acland married Emily Weddell Harper, the eldest daughter of Bishop Harper, at St Michael's Church. The Bishop's fifth daughter, Sarah Shephard Harper, was married at the same ceremony. With Acland's marriage, the former business partners became brothers in law. In 1862, Tripp and his wife went to visit England. His ailing father did not believe the stories of success, so Tripp instructed his agent to sell Orari Gorge Station and transfer the money to England as proof. When they returned to New Zealand, he bought the station back. Death After an illness of the liver lasting several months, Tripp died at Timaru on 6 July 1897. He was buried at Woodbury Cemetery (near Geraldine) three days later.

Written by Duncan Barrett and Nuala Calvi, the book was published by Collins in 2012. The authors were inspired to write it by Jennifer Worth's Call the Midwife.Call the Midwife, The Sugar Girls blog, 20 February 2012. Background In the East End of the 1940s and 1950s, thousands of girls left school every year at fourteen and went to work in the factories that stood alongside the docks in Silvertown, in the East End of London.< The stretch of factories running between Tate & Lyle‚Äôs refineries for sugar and syrup was known as the 'Sugar Mile', and also included Keiller's jam and marmalade factory. Tate & Lyle's two factories had been built in the late nineteenth century by two rival sugar refiners, Henry Tate and Abram Lyle, whose companies had merged in the 1920s. Of all the factories in Silvertown, Tate & Lyle's offered the best wages and social life for girls leaving school. There were various jobs available to women workers at Tate & Lyle's factories, including printing and packing the bags of sugar, and making the tins of Lyle's Golden Syrup. Women who worked there showed great 'loyalty' and 'pride'. They were, however, very tribal, and depending on which factory they worked at, workers would speak of themselves as coming from 'Tates's' or 'Lyles's', competing against each other at netball, athletics, football and cricket in the company sports day, which was held once a year. Characters Although the book is based on interviews with over fifty former workers, the four main characters featured are: * Ethel Colquhoun (n√©e Alleyne), a conscientious sugar-packer who worked her way up through the ranks at Tate & Lyle until she became a forelady in charge of 200 women. * Lilian Clark (n√©e Tull), a lovelorn can-maker who joined the factory at the age of 23, 'already scarred by terrible poverty'. * Gladys Hudgell (n√©e Taylor), a half-gypsy print-room girl who was always getting in trouble for 'practical jokes and general cheekiness' and who was almost sacked on a number of occasions, only keeping her job through her value to the factory athletics team. * Joan Cook, a fun-loving sugar-packer who was forced to leave the factory under a cloud when she unexpectedly became pregnant. As well as these four main women, the book features various other individual stories, such as: * Barbara, a cheeky young woman who seduced her future husband over a Tate & Lyle tennis match by exaggerating her own playing abilities to become his doubles partner. *Joan, a tea girl who punished a male manager who had groped her by running over his feet with her tea trolley. *Edna, who staged an unofficial strike when the factory was insufficiently heated and the women were instructed to work in their hats and coats. Characterisation of the 'Sugar Girls' and the East End Nuala Calvi, one of the co-authors of the book, characterised the female workers at Tate & Lyle ‚Äì known colloquially as the 'Sugar Girls' ‚Äì as 'glamorous', at least by the standards of teenagers leaving school in the East End in the 1940s and 1950s. They would take in their dungarees, making them figure-hugging, and stuff their turbans with underwear to make them sit high up on their heads, which was considered fashionable. But she also claimed that the women shared a common confident ‚Äòattitude‚Äô and were 'no pushovers', likening them to the striking workers at Ford‚Äôs Dagenham plant featured in the popular movie Made in Dagenham. In the same article, Calvi also commented on the discrepancy between the way the East End of London is often represented ‚Äì 'linked in the popular imagination with gangsters, criminals and prostitutes (or the grim squalor of Call the Midwife)' ‚Äì and the reality of life for the families of the women she interviewed ‚Äì 'honest, hard-working families' who 'brought up their children to contribute to the family income'. In a separate article, her co-author Duncan Barrett made a similar point: 'The women we spoke to recalled the great pride their mothers would take in keeping their houses spotless and how, despite a lack of money, families would always make do, helping out the neighbours when they could, knowing that the favour would always be returned. When we handed in the manuscript of the book, our publishers were a little surprised, perhaps expecting the predicable Dickensian East End of much misery-memoir writing. 'This is a lot jollier than we expected,' they told us.' Reception In a quotation featured on the cover of the paperback, Melanie McGrath, author of the books Silvertown and Hopping, described the book as 'An authoritative and highly readable work of social history which brings vividly to life a fascinating part of East End life before it is lost forever.' On 8 April 2012, The Sugar Girls debuted at No. 10 in the Sunday Times Bestseller List, spending five weeks in the top ten. In the paper's end-of-year round-up it ranked second for bestsellers in History, having sold 37,760 copies.

History and justification In 2002, the National Strategy for Homeland Security motivated Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) 5, 7, and 8 providing the national initiatives. Within these initiatives, HSEEP focuses on development of exercise around capabilities- based planning, National Response Plan (NRP), National Incident Management System (NIMS), the Universal Task List (UTL) and the Target Capabilities List (TCL) as established by the U.S. Federal Government. Documents HSEEP exercise and evaluation doctrine is flexible, scalable, adaptable, and is for use by stakeholders across the whole community. HSEEP doctrine is applicable for exercises across all mission areas‚Äîprevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery. Using HSEEP supports the National Preparedness System by providing a consistent approach to exercises and measuring progress toward building, sustaining, and delivering core capabilities.. HSEEP doctrine is based on national best practices and is supported by training, technology systems, tools, and technical assistance. The National Exercise Program (NEP) is consistent with the HSEEP methodology. Exercise practitioners are encouraged to apply and adapt HSEEP doctrine to meet their specific needs. The doctrine is organized as follows: Chapter 1 Chapter 1: HSEEP Fundamentals describes the basic principles and methodology of HSEEP. Chapter 2 Chapter 2: Exercise Program Management provides guidance for conducting a Training and Exercise Planning Workshop (TEPW) and developing a Multi-year Training and Exercise Plan (TEP). Chapter 3 Chapter 3: Exercise Design and Development describes the methodology for developing exercise objectives, conducting planning meetings, developing exercise documentation, and planning for exercise logistics, control, and evaluation. Chapter 4 Chapter 4: Exercise Conduct provides guidance on setup, exercise play, and wrap-up activities. Chapter 5 Chapter 5: Evaluation provides the approach to exercise evaluation planning and conduct through data collection, analysis, and development of an AAR. Chapter 6 Chapter 6: Improvement Planning addresses corrective actions identified in the exercise IP and the process of tracking corrective actions to resolution. Roles of exercises Exercises play a vital role in national preparedness by enabling whole community stakeholders to test and validate plans and capabilities, and identify both capability gaps and areas for improvement. A well-designed exercise provides a low-risk environment to test capabilities, familiarize personnel with roles and responsibilities, and foster meaningful interaction and communication across organizations. Exercises bring together and strengthen the whole community in its efforts to prevent, protect against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from all hazards.

It is the most extensive system of sand dunes in Cornwall and is believed to be the landing site of Saint Piran. Dating from the 6th century, St Piran's Oratory is thought to be one of the oldest Christian sites in Britain. The remains were discovered in the late 18th century, and in 2014 the covering sand was removed to reveal a building more than a thousand years old, in a reasonable state of preservation. A restricted military area dating from 1939, Penhale Camp, is found on the northern part of the dunes. The area has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) since 1953 and became a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) in 2004. The South West Coast Path runs through the dunes. Geography The sands are located south-west of the town of Newquay, in the civil parish of Perranzabuloe, stretching for over between Perranporth in the south and Holywell to the north, with the Atlantic Ocean and Perran Beach to the west. The Cornish sand dunes are thought to have formed over 5,000 years ago as sea levels rose to approximately their present levels. Penhale Sands are the largest dune system within Cornwall and has a maximum depth of of sand. The system, of over , extends for more than inland and includes Reen Sands, Gear Sands and Perransands. The South West Coast Path runs through the dunes. History St Piran Building covering the partly excavated St Piran's Oratory in 1952 Penhale Sands and Perran Beach are believed to be the 6th century landing site of Saint Piran from Ireland, regarded the bringer of Christianity to, and the patron saint of Cornwall. On this site, situated in a hollow, St Piran's Oratory was built around this time. It is thought to be the oldest Christian site in Cornwall and one of the oldest in Britain. The church was abandoned in the tenth century due to the encroachment of sand. A replacement church was built further inland and abandoned in 1795. The oratory site was excavated in 1835 and 1843 before the remains were encased in a large concrete structure in 1910. The concrete structure was removed in 1980 and the delicate site buried in sand for its protection.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books In 2014 the sand was removed to reveal the remains of the church. Penhale Camp Penhale Camp in 2009 Penhale Camp was established in 1939, to the north of the dunes, as a World War II emergency measure to train anti-aircraft gunners. There still remains evidence of the gun sites, searchlight batteries and defensive positions such as pillboxes and trenches. On 7 June 1940 the camp was bombed by a single German bomber, probably looking for the nearby St Eval airfield; twenty-two British soldiers were killed in the raid, most were subsequently buried in nearby Perranporth. In 1943 the camp was occupied by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the buildup to Operation Overlord, the D-Day landings. The engineers built the fourteen Nissen huts on the Camp; still used today as accommodation for training units. In 1955, three Royal Artillery men drowned while swimming in the sea at Perran Corner. These dangerous waters, with treacherous rip tides, have also claimed the lives of at least two civilians. The sand dunes have for many years been used by naturists, as an unofficial naturist beach. Over the years, the Ministry of Defence have complained about nude sunbathers, but a compromise was reached with the land owner in 2007 In April 2010, the camp was closed by the Ministry of Defence and was sold in September that year for ¬£1.5million. However, the area is still governed by Ministry of Defence ByelawsMinistry of Defence (1940) Penhale Light Anti-Aircraft Range Byelaws London: HMSO Today, Penhale Camp and the associated training area are available to all Arms and Services wishing to carry out low level infantry skills training, cadre courses, communications and CPX training. The surrounding area provides opportunities for all recognised adventurous training activities and the newer extreme sports such as power kiting and coasteering. Now established in Penhale Camp is EBO Adventure Centre which provides a diverse range of training activities including Military Resettlement. Protected area In 1953 the area was designated as the Perran Dunes Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), changed to Penhale Dunes in 1967 after a site expansion. It is designated because it is an outstanding example of a sand dune system and has a rich flora, including four very rare species of plants and other rarities. In 2004 it was designated as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The SSSI is contiguous with Kelsey Head SSSI, to the north. Wildlife and ecology The dune soil is calcareous because of the high percentage of seashell fragments which leads to a flora with lime-loving plants that are otherwise rare in Cornwall. The flora also includes at least sixty-six species of moss, making it one of richest sites in Cornwall. A number of rare plant species have been recorded on the site, these include Babington's leek (Allium babingtonii), brackish water buttercup (Ranunculus baudotii), Cornish gentian (Gentianella anglica subsp. cornubiensis), fragrant evening-primrose (Oenothera stricta), Italian lords-and-ladies (Arum italicum), Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica), shore-dock (Rumex rupestris), slender spike rush (Eleocharis acicularis), variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum) and wild leek (Allium ampeloprasum). Due to its importance as a site for lichens and rare plant species, Plantlife has designated the dunes an Important Plant Area. It is also an important site for its insect fauna, especially Lepidoptera, with the silver-studded blue butterfly sometimes counted in thousands. Twenty-seven species of butterfly and one hundred and seven species of moth have been recorded on the dunes. The exclusion of the public in the restricted military area of Penhale Camp has protected the nature conservation interest of this area.  Radio receiver station  Penhale Sands is home to a high frequency receiver station forming part of the Defence High Frequency Communications Service. The station is operated by Babcock International Group on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. Folklore Langarroc Penhale Sands is said to be the site of the legendary sunken town of Langarroc. On stormy nights the bells of Langarroc's seven churches are still heard to toll beneath the dunes.

In her view, workers‚Äô rights must be grounded in two values: autonomy and dignity. In her first tenure piece, Toward a Foundational Theory of Workers‚Äô Rights: The Autonomous Dignified Worker, published in the University of Missouri Law Review, Lofaso began to build that foundational theory.Toward a Foundational Theory of Workers‚Äô Rights: The Autonomous Dignified Worker, 76 U.M.K.C. L. REV. 1 (2007), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=975040 Lofaso draws on Raz‚Äôs theory of autonomy‚Äîto become part author of one‚Äôs life‚Äîand on Dworkin‚Äôs theory of dignity to argue that workplace laws should reflect those values. In Lofaso‚Äôs view, although government is typically the most coercive force in most people‚Äôs lives, the accumulation of private power is a close second. Accordingly, the law should play a role in protecting workers from those coercive forces (thereby promoting the autonomy and dignity of working-class people) by encouraging concerted activities for the purpose of mutual aid. The practice of collective bargaining is, for example, one way of liberating the working and middle classes. Lofaso continues that theme in a recent article, In Defense of Public Sector Unions, published in the Hofstra Law Review.In Defense of Public Sector Unions, 28 HOFSTRA LAB. L. J. 303 (2011) There she defends the role that public and private-sector unions play not only in liberating the working classes, but also in educating working- class people in how to be model citizens who can participate in a democracy. By contrast, Lofaso views the accumulation of economic power in the private sector as threatening a well-functioning democracy.

L. REV. 199 (2010), available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=1449552 Lofaso continues the theme of government and private sources of coercing working- class people. Lofaso exposes the coercive force of government, which she contends has narrowed the rights of working people in the post-New-Deal era in partial response to the pressure exerted by the private sector. Lofaso continues that theme in her article, The Vanishing Employee, published by the Florida International Law Review, by showing how each branch of government has contributed to eroding workers‚Äô rights primarily by narrowing the statutory definition of protected employees.The Vanishing Employee: Putting the Autonomous Dignified Union Worker Back To Work, 5 FIU L.

The twin engine C-46 Commando, registration N3944C, crashed approximately 10:25 pm in adverse weather conditions. Of the four crew and 36 passengers on board, 3 crew members and 23 passengers perished.Plain Crash Information, 1951, accident 69 The flight crew's poor judgment in attempting a flight by visual reference during instrument weather conditions was the cause of the accident.Aviation Safety Database, record id=19511229-0 Pre-accident narrative Continental Charters (no connection to the former Continental Airlines) Flight 44-2 originated in Miami, Florida where the airline was based. Continental Charters operated without a regular schedule and was equipped with military surplus aircraft, allowing the company to offer discounted fares. After a seven-hour delay due to mechanical problems, Flight 44-2 departed Miami and arrived safely but late into Pittsburgh's Allegheny County Airport. The flight carried a crew of four, 24 passengers bound for Pittsburgh, and a backup crew of three who were to fly the plane back to Miami. The plan was to stop in Pittsburgh, deplane the 24 passengers, then go to Buffalo, return to Pittsburgh, and the return to Miami. The crew opted to board 29 passengers waiting in Pittsburgh for the flight to Miami, fly to Buffalo and then return directly from Buffalo to Miami to make up lost time. The crew also opted to fly VFR direct to Buffalo from Pittsburgh instead of filing a flight plan under instrument flight rules that would take them in a less than direct route to Buffalo. Flying under instrument flight rules would also have required an additional delay for refueling in Pittsburgh. When the crew filed their VFR fight plan, they were advised that stations along the proposed route (Bradford, Pennsylvania and Jamestown, New York) were reporting ceilings and visibility below VFR minimums. The weather briefer further stated that VFR flight was not recommended over their intended route due to low ceilings and poor visibility.The Civil Aeronautics Board Accident Investigation Report File Number 1-0101 March 7, 1952The Buffalo (NY) News, Article 691535 Mishap flight Continental Charters Flight 44-2 left Pittsburgh at 9:47 pm. The direct course to Buffalo (heading 018 degrees true) would take the flight slightly east of Jamestown, New York and into Buffalo. Reports of witnesses on the ground located by accident investigators after the crash indicated that the aircraft began drifting east of the direct route soon after takeoff. The plane was also reported to have been flying very low and that the weather was very poor, with zero ceiling and visibility along the route. The plane's flight path, miles east of the direct course, resulted in the aircraft flying over significantly higher terrain, the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains, than the flight would have encountered on the direct route. The only surviving crew member, a flight attendant, later recounted that the two relief pilots went forward into the cockpit just before the crash. Loud discussion and cursing was heard among the pilots. Moments later, the crash sequence began. Crash scene The crash sequence began about 38 minutes into the flight. The aircraft first struck the top of a tree 60 feet above the ground located about 100 feet below the top of wooded ridge. The ridge, called 'Bucktooth Ridge,' is 2375 feet in elevation. Forward movement continued for 933 feet as the aircraft struck other trees and disintegrated from the impact. All major parts of the aircraft were accounted for. The only part of the aircraft that was not destroyed was the aft passenger compartment, which rolled to a stop at the far end of the debris field. All 14 survivors were seated in this section. There was no post crash fire. The aircraft was later written off as a total loss. Post crash survival The ordeal had just begun for the survivors of Flight 44-2. The 14 survivors spent two days and two nights at the crash site in below freezing temperatures waiting to be rescued. Snow was chest high in the area. Two men tried to walk out to get help on the day after the crash but had to turn back. On the second day, one of the men was able to get to a farm house several miles away and get help. All 14 survivors had injuries of varying severity and were taken to hospital. Accident investigation The crash was investigated by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The investigation found that the crew, the aircraft and the carrier were properly certified and that the aircraft was properly loaded and fueled. They found that there was no malfunction of the aircraft and the engines were operating properly. The investigation also found that the crew filed a VFR flight plan when instrument weather conditions prevailed over the proposed route and that flight was conducted below the prescribed minimum altitude for VFR night operations. The probable cause was determined to be \\"the captain's poor judgement in attempting a flight by visual reference during instrument weather conditions.\\" Implications The accident occurred just as passenger airline service was developing in the United States. To control public perceptions that air travel was unsafe, the CAB Chairman Donald Nyrop visited the crash scene on January 1, 1952 and reassured the public that the crash had not been caused by a mechanical failure of the airplane. The loss of Flight 44-2 also led to new airline safety rules. The CAB issued a draft regulation on March 10, 1952, requiring that night visual flights on passenger planes in large aircraft be conducted only on designated routes and between airports equipped with radio communications.

Data falsification investigation Data fabrication by Das was alleged by a university investigation committee to have begun in 2005, when \\"there was no one in the lab with the expertise to prepare Western blots.\\" Regarding Das' falsification of figures in his published works, in explicitly identifying 145 such cases the investigation committee reported that \\"many figures had more manipulations but, for expediency, the review board only noted the most obvious.\\" The investigation report further stated that \\"given the large number of irregularities discovered, which were done over several years and in several different ways, the review board can only conclude that they were the result of intentional acts of data falsification and fabrication, designed to deceive.\\" The university notified 11 scientific journals that published papers authored by Das, and the U.S. Office of Research Integrity launched an independent investigation of his work. In January 2012, University of Connecticut officials reported that dismissal proceedings were underway against Das. The Health Center terminated all research in Das‚Äôs laboratory and declined federal research grants awarded to him.

The game was released in March 2010 on Steam for Microsoft Windows and on Xbox Live Indie Games for the Xbox 360. Flotilla was designed with Microsoft's XNA tools, and its development was influenced by animals as well as board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror. The game takes the player in an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy. Chung began developing Flotilla immediately after the closure of Pandemic Studios, where he had worked as a designer. The new game used assets imported from Chung's early space combat prototype, Space Pi√±ata. Flotilla incorporates several pieces of classical music in its score, such as Chopin's \\"Raindrop\\" prelude. It received mixed reviews from video game media outlets, scoring 72 out of 100 on review aggregate website Metacritic, and was included in Mike Rose's book 250 Indie Games You Must Play.  Gameplay  Flotilla allows the player and artificially intelligent opponents to issue orders to their ships every 30 seconds, and then watch their orders play out in real time. Flotilla is a three-dimensional simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game set in a randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to their ships, which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion over a period of 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to their ships, which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed. At the beginning of the game, the player is usually given two ships to control, but more become available as the game continues. Ships may be rotated arbitrarily in any direction. The single- player mode is an \\"adventure\\" that can be played an indefinite number of times. These adventures have a duration of around 30 minutes. The character dies at the end of each adventure and the player is given the option to play again. A hardcore mode, which removes the solo mode's standard 30-minute time limit, was later added to the game. Each time the player starts a new adventure, a new galaxy is randomly generated and filled with planets and enemy ships. The player may take a short tutorial before beginning the adventure. Each planet offers a possible quest or challenge to the player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can be harmed only from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter is added to the player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.  Development  Brendon Chung, developer of Flotilla Flotilla was developed by Brendon Chung's video game studio, Blendo Games. Chung, who worked as a level designer for Pandemic Studios, previously contributed to the development of Full Spectrum Warrior (2004) and Lord of the Rings: Conquest (2009). Chung started coding Flotilla in 2009 after Electronic Arts closed Pandemic Studios. He was excited at the time of the studio's closure, and said that \\"there was adrenaline pumping through my veins\\". The game was developed using Microsoft XNA, a set of game development tools created by Microsoft. The concept of Flotilla came from a combination of \\"sci-fi like Star Wars and submarine movies\\". Chung explained that he \\"figured there was enough games about little fighter jets\\", and that what he had in mind was \\"a jumbo battleship floating in space\\". Animals, instead of aliens, are featured as characters in the game. Chung explained that he did so because \\"any fantastical creature design I came up with would pale in comparison to already-existing designs made by other people.\\" Therefore, instead of trying to solve the problem of creating compelling alien characters, he switched to animals: \\"[they] have certain built-in characteristics, they were fairly unique in how they weren't typically associated with space adventures.\\" Novo Staff (April 28, 2014). Gaming Week: Flotilla . Novo Adagio. Retrieved on April 29, 2014. In an interview with SquareGo, Chung revealed that board games such as Axis and Allies and Arkham Horror had an influential role in the game's development process. Before Flotilla, Chung worked on a prototype, a two-dimensional turn-based space action game called Space Pi√±ata, whose gameplay and structure were similar to those of the final version of Flotilla. Chung intentionally limited the solo mode's play time as an \\"experiment in making a short-story generator\\", such that an adventure could begin and end within a half hour. Following a negative response, a patch was deployed to change this limitation. The patch included a new \\"hardcore\\" mode. Flotilla score incorporates several pieces of classical music, such as Chopin's \\"Raindrop\\" prelude. According to Edge magazine, the \\"Raindrop\\" prelude gives the game's battles \\"an emotional undercurrent\\". Chung said the soundtrack was designed to give the game \\"a tragic feel\\" and that he wanted the game to be portrayed as \\"the anti-testosterone-fueled\\" action game. On February 27, 2020, Flotillas 10th release anniversary, Blendo games released the game's source code to the public as open source software.flotilla source release on blendogames.com (2020-02-27)blendo-games-have-open-sourced-their-strategic- space-adventure-flotilla on gamingonlinux.com (2020) The source code is Zlib licensed on GitHub, assets are not included and need to be bought.blendogames/flotilla on github.com  Reception  Flotilla received a mixed response from video game journalists upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 72 based on7 reviews. British magazine Edge included Flotilla in its 2010 list of the Best 20 Indie Games available in the Xbox Live Marketplace, and acknowledged that the game was \\"as exacting as it is quirky, a stiff challenge beneath a sugar coating.\\" Mike Rose included Flotilla in his book 250 Indie Games You Must Play. The American version of PC Gamer commented that Flotilla \\"is a charmingly crafted bite-size portion of tactical fun\\". Meanwhile, the British version of the magazine elaborated that although the game had its share of \\"charm and character,\\" it was nonetheless a random experience. PC Zone UK characterized Flotilla as stylish and funny, but concluded that it was a \\"sadly disposable\\" experience. Edge gave a mixed response to the game, but praised the battles, which they considered \\"engaging despite their simplicity.\\" An editor from the website Charge Shot praised the game's artificial intelligence and overall design, but criticized the multiplayer mode. Joe Martin from Bit-Tech named Flotilla a \\"hilarious and brazenly original\\" game. However, he criticized the interface and navigation gameplay, which he condemned as \\"trying to pilot a radio-controlled helicopter with someone else's feet.\\" He also mentioned the lack of a speed-up feature in battles; he considered such a feature necessary for the game. GameZone Tom Dann also felt frustrated by the ship maneuvering mechanics, though he concluded that they \\"can also be rewarding and entertaining\\". Flotilla was nominated for the 2011 Independent Games Festival Visions Award, but lost to Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It was also listed among the Honorable Mentions for the Excellence in Visual Art and Excellence in Design awards. Sequel Blendo Games announced Flotilla 2 in April 2018, with a then-expected release date of August 1, 2018. The sequel is designed for virtual reality hardward and initially exclusive to the HTC Vive headset; the virtual reality aspect allows players to move around the space environment to plan out their tactics.

Early career Percy Shepherd was born in Romford, Essex on 8 August 1878 but was brought up in the north of England. He attended school at The College, Buxton, Derbyshire from 1891 to 1894, and on leaving school spent a year in the millwright's department of Armstrong Whitworth & Co. of Manchester. He then served a four-year pupilage with Berkeley Deane Wise, Chief Engineer to the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, in Belfast from 1895 until 1899. During his pupilage he was engaged in work for the Belfast and Northern Counties Railway, including the re-arrangement of York Street Station and the erection of the new railway hotel, the Northern Counties Hotel. Then he worked for ten years as an assistant to W.B. Worthington on the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway, before setting up in independent practice in Manchester around 1909 when he around 31 years old. Military career On the outbreak of the First World War he joined the coastal defence company Kent Fortress Royal Engineers as a 2nd Lieutenant. After training, he transferred to the Inland Waterways and Docks company of the Royal Engineers and spent his war years in waterways, docks and harbour works, being promoted through the ranks to Major in 1918. By the end of the war he had been given command of the construction of the National Shipyard at Portbury on the Avon. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1920 for services to National Shipyards. Post-military career He was retained on Government service after the war, when he was sent to Danzig as technical adviser to the High Commissioner who had charge of the apportionment between Danzig and Poland of former German and Prussian property. On his return from Danzig he spent a year with the Office of Works in London before being offered the position of chief engineer to the newly established Northern Ireland Ministry of Finance. Shepherd was appointed as Director of the Board of Works for the Government of Northern Ireland. Two of his most outstanding projects were the Bann drainage Scheme carried out in the 1930s and the Lough Erne drainage scheme carried out in the 1950s. Shepherd formed the Northern Ireland association of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1934 and became its first Chairman. Personal life Percy lived with his wife in Bangor, Northern Ireland in a house built in 1924 and designed by RI Smith and T. F. O. Rippingham, which was controversially demolished in 2008.

It competed at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in February 2012. The film takes its title from the Byzantine monastery complex Met√©ora, in Thessaly, a series of structures built on natural sandstone pillars whose tops often disappear into the clouds. Plot The monastery at Meteora All action takes place at, or near, the Monastery of the Holy Trinity, Meteora. A young Greek monk falls in love with a Russian nun. The story looks at the struggle between religious devotion, temptations of the flesh, the yearning of the human heart, and the role of the individual within the community of believers. The two communicate with each other across the valley using mirrors to flash a morse code signal, with lights dancing on the wall of her cell in the Agios Stefano Convent, also set on a rock pinnacle. The film is set in Central Greece, where medieval monasteries perch on the apex of hugely dramatic sandstone pinnacles, and the main access is to be hauled up in a net tied to a rope. A steep set of steps also access from one side. Views are breath-taking, and often in extreme long-shot, with human figures appearing as small black dots on the screen. The monks and nuns obey the rituals of the Greek Orthodox Church in this austere environment, remote from modern human life in every sense with the strong rhythm of prayer and asceticism. Basic food (bread and milk) is delivered to the monks by the nuns, and winched up using the same net and rope system used for the monks themselves. There is no electricity, and lighting is by means of oil lamps. Music in the monastery is limited to rhythmic hammering on a suspended wooden board and a few bells. The film is interspersed with animation, based on ancient Greek icons. \\"Meteora\\" means \\"lifted into heights\\" or \\"afloat\\", as is the case of the two lovers whose emotions are in such a state - in limbo between their belief and their desire.

The days Monday through Saturday were school days, but Saturday classes involved activities outside of the classroom.\\"Japanese high school to open in U.S.\\" Associated Press at the Bangor Daily News. Tuesday May 9, 1989. 17. Retrieved from Google News (40 of 111) on January 11, 2012. This differs from area American schools, where the school year had 180 days and students went to classes only from Monday through Friday. Each school day at Tennessee Meiji Gakuin was one hour longer than a typical American school day. The school was scheduled to employ 12 people in Sweetwater and the surrounding area. The school had eight full time local employees, including two cooks. Other local employees included custodians and employees in the school's business office. Students who had to travel outside of the school for a period of time were required to check out of their dormitories. Tuition In 1989 the school levied $12,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) for tuition and $2,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) in one- time registration fees. Students living in the dormitories paid $4,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) for annual room and board. The school also levied $1,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) per year for usage of recreational areas and school buildings. In 1992 the tuition was $19,000 ($ when adjusted for inflation) per year. Choong Soon Kim, author of Japanese Industry in the American South, said the tuition was very high and few Japanese middle managers working for Japanese companies in Tennessee were able to afford to send their children to Tennessee Meiji Gakuin. In 1994 the tuition was $13,200 per school year. In addition, the cost of food (board) was $5,000, the one time entrance fee was $3,000, and the facilities fee was $1,500. At the time the school gave a 20% discount to a student from a family not resident in Japan. Curriculum From Monday through Friday, the English language, fine arts, health and physical education, history, the Japanese language, mathematics, religion, and science were taught in seven fifty-minute periods. With the exception of the classes in English as a foreign language, art, and physical education, all classes were conducted in the Japanese language. In 1989, at the school's opening ceremony, the president of the University of Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, argued that the Japanese educational system that would be exhibited at Tennessee Meiji would be superior to that of American schools. He compared and contrasted the Japanese system to Maryville High School in Maryville, a then-well-regarded public school. Alexander said that the same number of courses completed at Tennessee Meiji Gakuin in three years would be completed at Maryville, and that TMG offered more difficult courses than Maryville. Alexander also stated that TMG had a longer school term, and that students were in school for six days instead of the American five days. Also Alexander said that TMG students were to receive three times the amount of homework that Maryville students received at the time. Hiroshi Jo, the school director, stated in 1994 that the school was \\"quite successful\\" in having graduates admitted to major universities in Japan. Faculty The Japanese government required all teachers to be Japanese nationals due to Japanese governmental requirements; this included English teachers. Hiroshi Jo, the school's director, said in 1989 that the requirement was \\"ridiculous.\\" Around 1989 the school planned to have 22 to 23 teachers. Student body The school, as originally planned in 1989, had a capacity of 69 students per grade, with a total capacity of 207. When the school first opened, it had a class of 24 students, including 13 boys and 11 girls. Of them, one had a family living in the United States. In the northern hemisphere spring of 1992, 109 students were enrolled at the school. 70 students, 64% of the student body, were Japanese people who were resident in Japan. They attended the school even though their parents did not work in Japanese company offices in the United States. Of students residing in the U.S., the largest number, 11, lived in New England. The second largest number, 9, lived in the Midwest. 6 students, including 2 students living in Tennessee, were resident in the South. In 1994 about 66% of the students were Japanese nationals resident in Japan while 33% were Japanese nationals resident outside Japan. Of those resident outside Japan, some lived in the United States, with many from Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. Some students had families resident in Canada, Mexico, and South America. In 1997 the graduating class had 194 students. The final graduating class in 2007 had 26 students. Throughout its history, the students resident in Japan were sent to the school to learn about American culture and the English language. Extracurricular activities Students at Meiji Gakuin often took weekend homestays with local families.

Products included several Arduino-based camera triggers, along with Android and iOS apps which interface with cameras using a device that plugs into the headphone socket of the smartphone or tablet. Triggertrap ceased trading on the 31st of January 2017 Background The story of Triggertrap started in July 2011, when Haje Jan Kamps started a Kickstarter campaign aiming to raise support for a new type of camera trigger. The project asked for $25,000, but within a month nearly 900 supporters had pledged more than $77,000 in exchange for more than 950 Triggertrap v1 products - which is nearly three times more than what they wanted for the project. Arduino-based products Triggertrap shield on arduino The Triggertrap v1 is a programmable trigger based on Arduino open- source architecture, and the source-code for the product is downloadable from GitHub. It has a built-in ambient light sensor, laser sensor, and sound sensor. In addition, it has an auxiliary port, which enables Triggertrap v1 to trigger a camera based on anything that generates an electric signal. The Triggertrap v1 is classed as a high-speed device, able to use the ambient light sensor to respond and fire the external flash such that it would correctly sync at shutter speeds down to 1/640th of a second- that's a response time of less than 1.6 milliseconds. By using the Laser sensor, users can use a laser pointer or laser module (both visible and infra-red lasers are supported), pointing it at the laser sensor of the device. The user can then choose to trigger \\"on break\\" (when the laser beam is broken), \\"on make\\" (when the laser beam hits the sensor), or both. The device has a built-in sensor (a microphone with simple amplification circuitry) that can trigger the camera whenever Triggertrap v1 senses sound over a user-adjustable threshold. Triggertrap v1 also has an auxiliary port, to which the user can connect anything as long as the user can find a way to create an electric signal. This can be used to connect the Triggertrap v1 to a number of other devices. Among other things, the product's users have used the Aux sensor to take photos as part of theme-park rides and Halloween haunted house-type projects. The device can control hundreds of cameras via infra-red or wired trigger system (depending upon cameras capability). \\"Part of the excitement about the Triggertrap\\", says its inventor, Haje Jan Kamps, \\"is that I have no idea what people are going to use it for. It's an incredibly versatile piece of photography kit, and because it is so easy to hack, I'm expecting creativity to go off the charts.\\" The open-source nature of the Triggertrap v1 has attracted users to create a series of hacks and amendments to the original design, including 3D printed casings, suction mounts, tripod mounts, multi- camera adaptations, and others. In addition to the Triggertrap v1, the Triggertrap company markets a Triggertrap Shield for Arduino. This is a feature-compatible version of the Triggertrap v1. After a user-configurable change in the config files, it runs on the same source code. The Shield for Arduino is cheaper, and aimed more at the hacking crowd. Triggertrap Mobile In May 2012, Triggertrap introduced Triggertrap Mobile for iOS, followed by a version for Android in September 2012. Triggertrap Mobile utilises the sensors and processing power of a smartphone or tablet running IOS to trigger cameras based on sound, motion, vibration, or location, in addition to timelapse, bulb ramping, and other features. The Android app has more limited functionality, to some users dismay. The apps connect to a camera by connecting a Triggertrap Mobile Dongle to the headphone socket of the smartphone or tablet. The app uses a coded audio signal, which the Mobile Dongle then translates into a signal the camera can use to trigger. The company currently sells nine different connection cables, covering more than 300 different camera models. Triggertrap Ada In November 2013, the Triggertrap Ada was successfully crowd-funded via Kickstarter, raising ¬£290,386 though the original goal was ¬£50,000. On 2 March 2015, Triggertrap announced that they had failed to bring the product into production and that the remaining 20% of the funds from the Kickstarter campaign was going to be returned to the original backers. Triggertrap and CEO Haje Jan Kamps received criticism from backers of the failed Triggertrap Ada project. Some backers have questioned the accuracy of the updates during the course of the campaign. Less than three months before the project was cancelled, Triggertrap announced that the shipping date would be May 2015, exactly 12 months after the original shipping estimate.Shipping Date Announcement! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/triggertrap/triggertrap-redsnap-modular- camera-trigger/posts/1085421 Retrieved 15 April 2015 Others have questioned the allocation of funds by Triggertrap and their interpretation of the Terms of Service that Triggertrap entered into when the project was created.

He began his professional career with SV Sandhausen of the 3. Liga, winning the title in 2012 and again on loan to Karlsruher SC a year later. After one 2. Bundesliga season with Sandhausen, he joined 1. FC N√ºrnberg in 2014 on a free transfer, and almost immediately suffered a six- month knee injury. After losing the play-off for promotion to the Bundesliga against Eintracht Frankfurt in 2016, he joined that team, where he was a DFB- Pokal runner-up in 2017 and winner a year later. Football career SV Sandhausen Born in Frankenthal, Rhineland-Palatinate, Blum was on the books of FC Schalke 04 as a youth and was given his first professional contract at SV Waldhof Mannheim before joining SV Sandhausen months later. He made his professional debut for Sandhausen on 23 March 2010 in the 3. Liga, as a 59th- minute substitute for Daniel Jungwirth in a 3‚Äì0 loss away to VfB Stuttgart II, totalling eight games (three starts) in his first season. The following season he was a regular, playing 30 of 38 games, starting all but four. In 2011‚Äì12, Blum's time was split between the field and the bench as Sandhausen were promoted as champions. He scored three goals for them, the first on 19 November in a 2‚Äì0 home win over SC Preu√üen M√ºnster, eight minutes after coming on for Roberto Pinto. On 5 June 2012, Blum was loaned back into the third tier, joining relegated Karlsruher SC for the season. He was again a league champion despite playing rarely, and scored his one goal on 15 December in a 3‚Äì1 home win against VfB Stuttgart II as a late substitute. In 2013‚Äì14, Blum competed with Sandhausen in the 2. Bundesliga, with the team having stayed up due to MSV Duisburg's administrative relegation. He played 19 games in the second tier and scored four goals, the first to open a 2‚Äì0 home win over FSV Frankfurt on 3 November. 1. FC N√ºrnberg On 23 May 2014, Blum joined fellow 2. Bundesliga team 1. FC N√ºrnberg on a free transfer. In pre-season, he suffered knee cartilage damage that ruled him out for six months, and was given a 50% chance by his doctor of playing professionally again. He finally made his FCN debut on 15 February 2016, replacing Peniel Mlapa for the final 12 minutes of a 2‚Äì0 win over 1. FC Union Berlin at home. A week later, again from the bench, he scored his first goal to give the lead in a 3‚Äì1 win at Fortuna D√ºsseldorf, eventually totalling three in 12 games (four starts). In 2015‚Äì16, N√ºrnberg came third and played a play-off against Eintracht Frankfurt for promotion to the Bundesliga, with Blum a late substitute in both legs of the 2‚Äì1 aggregate defeat. Eintracht Frankfurt Blum with VFL Bochum in September 2019 On 30 June 2016, Blum's contract ended and he joined Frankfurt on a free transfer. He signed a one-year deal with the option of two more. He made his debut on 21 August in the first round of the DFB-Pokal away to 1. FC Magdeburg, coming on in the 83rd minute in place of Branimir Hrgota and scoring in a penalty shootout victory. In the quarter-finals on 28 February 2017, he scored the only goal against Arminia Bielefeld at the Commerzbank Arena, in the sixth minute. On 27 May, he played the last 11 minutes of the final, a 2‚Äì1 loss to Borussia Dortmund at the Berlin Olympiastadion, in place of Marco Fabi√°n. In his first league season with Frankfurt, Blum played rarely. His only goal came in the last minute of the season, to achieve a 2‚Äì2 home draw with RB Leipzig. In 2017‚Äì18, Blum played only 36 minutes over the whole season, but still scored two goals, one in the second round of the cup in a 4‚Äì0 win at 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 on 24 October. Frankfurt won the trophy on 19 May, defeating Bayern Munich 3‚Äì1 in the final, but Blum was not in the matchday squad. On 27 August 2018, Blum moved abroad for the first time in his career, joining Segunda Divisi√≥n side UD Las Palmas on a season-long loan deal. Around the turn of the year, he suffered an injury in his left soleus muscle and was ruled out for six to eight weeks, recuperating back at Frankfurt. He played 24 total matches during his time in the Canary Islands, and scored the only goal of a home win against C√≥rdoba CF on 12 May 2019. VfL Bochum On 21 May 2019, Blum signed a two-year contract with 2. Bundesliga club VfL Bochum. He scored a penalty on his debut on 28 July, a 3‚Äì1 loss at SSV Jahn Regensburg. On 1 March 2020, he scored a hat-trick in a 4‚Äì4 draw against former club Sandhausen, with two in the first eight minutes.

The film competed at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival,Article at Aesthetica where it won the Alfred Bauer Award (Silver Bear for a feature film that opens new perspectives) and The International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) prizes. Tabu at Komplizen Film Plot ;Prologue A narrator, Miguel Gomes himself, reads in voice-over a poetic and philosophical text that invokes a legend in which the Creator orders, but the heart commands: the suicide of an intrepid explorer who, somewhere in Africa, long ago, plunges into a turbid river after a frustrated love affair and is devoured by a crocodile. Many swear they have seen a beautiful woman and a sad crocodile on the riverbank and that the two share a mysterious empathy. ;Part 1‚ÄîParadise Lost Three disparate women dwell in an old building in Lisbon. Aurora, an octogenarian living off her pension, eccentric, talkative and superstitious, seeming more dead than alive, and Santa, her housemaid from Cape Verde, live at the same apartment. Santa is semi-literate, but proficient in the divinatory art of voodoo. Pilar, their neighbor and friend, a Catholic middle-aged woman, and militant social benefactor, involves herself in their psychodramas. Pilar has another friend, a romantic painter in love, a gentleman who insists on offering her tacky pieces of art. But Pilar is more concerned with Aurora: with Aurora's solitude, with her frequent escapes to the casino. She is even more worried about Santa, with her long silences and devil arts. Santa thinks it better to take care of oneself without annoying others, so keeps quiet. Something else concerns the old lady: understanding she will die soon, she feels someone is missing her, someone her friends have never heard about: Gian-Luca Ventura. So she asks Pilar to find him. She succeeds in doing so and the man appears. He is an old colonist, a disturbed man, from Mozambique, a former Portuguese colony. Another story emerges, beginning: \\"Aurora had a farm in Africa at the foothill of Mount Tabu...\\" ;Part 2‚ÄîParadise Flashback: The story of Aurora's life, told by Gian-Luca Ventura in voice over. This part takes place shortly before the Portuguese Colonial War began.Tabu ‚Äì Reference at European Film Awards In 1960s Portuguese Africa, Aurora and her husband live together near the Tabu Mountain. She is a skilled hunter, never missing a shot. She owns a small crocodile, a gift from her husband, which moves around the house as a pet. One day, the animal runs away. The pregnant Aurora finds it in Ventura's house, where they consummate their existing mutual attraction; a passionate and dangerous love affair ensues. Gian-Luca confides in his friend, Mario, about the affair. Mario demands that Gian-Luca end the affair and when he is ignored, the two start fighting. The heavily pregnant Aurora picks up a revolver and shoots and kills Mario. She later gives birth to a girl. Two days later, Gian-Luca leaves Africa for good.

Critical reception Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded Tabu four of five stars, and called the film \\"a gem: gentle, eccentric, possessed of a distinctive sort of innocence‚Äîand also charming and funny.\\" But in his review of Tabu, New York Times critic A. O. Scott faults the director for glossing over the issues of colonialism in the film in favor of simple aestheticism. \\"Unlike other recent European films (like Philippe Falardeau‚Äôs Congorama and Claire Denis‚Äôs White Material), Tabu views colonialism as an aesthetic opportunity rather than a political or moral problem,\\" wrote Scott. \\"It is full of longing‚Äîhedged, self-conscious, but palpable all the same‚Äîfor a vanished way of life, in contrast to which contemporary reality seems drab and numb.\\" This view was not shared by The New Yorker's critic Richard Brody, who wrote, \\"Gomes sees the predatory injustices of colonial life as a sort of Wild West of anarchic self-indulgence and self- reinvention . . . Nothing suggests nostalgia for or ambivalence about Portugal's colonial empire.\\" Brody called Tabu \\"one of the most original and inventive‚Äîas well as trenchantly political and painfully romantic‚Äîmovies of recent years\\". On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a \\"certified fresh\\" approval rating of 87% based on 54 reviews, and an average rating of 7.9/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Education and early life  Bhadeshia was born in Kenya to Indian parents, who were carpenters. During the 19th century, many Indian workers emigrated to Kenya for building bridges, railway tracks, shops etc. Bhadeshia's interest in science started when he visited the battery shop where his father worked. He was educated at the Kongoni Primary School followed by the Highway Secondary School, both in Nairobi. He moved with his family to the United Kingdom in 1970 and joined the British Oxygen Company in Edmonton as a technician in their metallurgical quality control laboratory. This allowed him study part-time at the East Ham College of Technology in London, for the Ordinary National Certificate in Science. He then moved to the quality control laboratory at Murex Welding Processes, and they sponsored him to study at the City of London Polytechnic where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1976. Professor Robert Honeycombe was at the time the External Examiner for the course at the Polytechnic and encouraged him to join his research group at the University of Cambridge. He was admitted to the University of Cambridge to work on the theory and significance of retained austenite in steels and obtained his PhD in 1980 supervised by David V. Edmonds, in Honeycombe's Steel Research Group. The nature of austenite that is retained depends on the preceding phase transformations - as a research student he focused therefore on unravelling the choreography of atoms when austenite undergoes bainitic or martensitic transformation. Career and research Bhadeshia's research is concerned with the theory of solid-state transformations in metals, particularly multicomponent steels, with the goal of creating novel alloys and processes with the minimum use of resources. Following his PhD, he worked as a Science Research Council Research Fellow until 1981 and has been part of the academic staff at the University of Cambridge since then. He is the author or co-author of more than 650 published papers in the field of metallurgy and several books. In the 90s, he worked with British Steel plc on a carbide-free, silicon-rich bainitic steel that was used for rails in the Channel Tunnel and later on a high-performance armour steel for the British Ministry of Defence. In 2006, he was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal by the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining for \\"outstanding services to the Steel Industry\\". In November 2008, he was appointed the first Tata Steel Professor of Metallurgy following a donation by Tata Steel to endow this Chair on a permanent basis at the University of Cambridge and he established and took the lead of the new \\"SKF University Technology Centre\\", between SKF and the University of Cambridge to conduct research in the field of the physical metallurgy of bearing steels, over the period 2009‚Äì2019. During 2005‚Äì2018, as the Founding Director of the Computational Metallurgy Laboratory, he helped create the Graduate Institute for Ferrous Technology at POSTECH in the Republic of Korea.  Teaching  Bhadeshia has developed a wide range of freely accessible teaching materials on metallurgy and associated subjects.Teaching materials The subject matters cover crystallography, metals and alloys, steels in particular, phase transformation theory, thermodynamics, kinetics, mathematical modelling in materials science, information theory, process modelling, thermal analysis, ethics and natural philosophy. The resources include lecture notes, slides, videos, algorithms, review articles, books, cartoons, audio files, experimental data archives, image libraries, seminars, examples classes, question sheets and answers, automated learning (MOOCS), and a diverse range of other electronic resources. A YouTube channel (bhadeshia123) contains about 1300 educational videos.Teaching videos The resources are archived as a permanent record by the British Library in an open access mode.

Fratt (January 25, 1825November 12, 1910) was an American businessman and politician. He was president of the Racine County Bank for fifty years. He also served two years in the Wisconsin State Senate and was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives and Governor of Wisconsin. Biography Nicholas Fratt was born in Watervliet, in Albany County, New York, to Catherine (Miller) and Jacob Fratt. As a young man, he worked for his father in the provision and packing business. At age 18, in 1843, he moved to Racine, in the Wisconsin Territory, and was employed at a packing house. In 1844, he went into business with Charles Herrick and opened a meat market and packing business. Two years later, his brother, Francis, arrived from New York and took the place of Herrick as his partner in the business. The company thrived and was his primary employment for the next fourteen years. In 1853, Fratt was one of the founders of the Racine County Bank, and would serve as President of the bank from 1859 to 1908. The bank became First National Bank & Trust Co. of Racine, and in 1988 was absorbed into Bank One Corporation. In 1855, Fratt bought a farm west of Racine. The land was later incorporated into the City of Racine in the neighborhood known as \\"West Racine\\". Fratt lived on his farm until 1894, when he moved into the city and bought a home on College Avenue. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1858 and served in the 12th and 13th sessions of the Wisconsin Legislature (1859 and 1860). In 1874, he was the Democratic candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Wisconsin's 1st congressional district, losing to incumbent Charles G. Williams. Fratt ran for Governor of Wisconsin twice, in 1881 and 1884. In both elections he was defeated by Republican Jeremiah McLain Rusk. Personal life In 1846, Fratt married Elsie Duffes. Duffes had been born near Aberdeen, Scotland, and immigrated with her parents, in 1835, first to Canada, then to Illinois, and, in 1840, to Racine County. Nicholas and Elsie had eight children with six surviving to adulthood--three sons and three daughters. Elsie died in 1890, leaving Nicholas a widower. Nicholas Fratt died in 1910. He bequeathed land from his farm to the school district, on which the first school in West Racine was built. The school opened in 1916 and continues to operate as Fratt Elementary School in the Racine Unified School District.

He ruled from 1715 to 1769.  Life  Joseph was the eldest son of Prince Meinrad II of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen (1673‚Äì1715) from his marriage to Johanna Katharina von Montfort (1678‚Äì1759), daughter of Count Johann Anton I of Montfort-Tettnang. He was initially raised by his mother. However, due to the turmoil of the War of the Spanish Succession, the family moved to his father's residence in Vienna. Joseph continued to be educated in Vienna after his parents returned to Sigmaringen in 1714. After his father's death in 1715, he succeeded as Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. However, as he was still a minor, he stood under his mother's regency until 1720. Shortly before 1720, Joseph joined the Austrian army, where he held the rank of General of the Cavalry and later Fieldmarshal Lieutenant of the imperial Swabian Circle. Joseph managed to befriend the Electorate of Bavaria and after the election, Emperor Charles VII appointed him as imperial Geheimrat. Joseph was an avid hunter and in 1727, he created the game park Josefslust in Sigmaringen. In 1736, he modernized and remodeled Sigmaringen Castle. He also embellished the local Knight's Hall and added portraits of all his ancestors. In Sigmaringen, he built the St Johann's Church, the St. Joseph Chapel, and the Jagdschloss in Josefslust Park. In Haigerloch, which he preferred as a residence over Sigmaringen, he built the St Anna's Church. He was known as a patron of the arts. He commissioned works by the artist Johann Michael Feuchtmayer, Johann Georg Weckenmann and Andreas Meinrad von Ow. He supported the canonization of the local saint Fidelis of Sigmaringen. He also supported the school and church life.  Marriages and Issue  In Oettingen on 20 May 1722 Joseph married firstly with Maria Franziska Louise (21 May 1703 ‚Äì 29 November 1737), daughter of Prince Franz Albrecht of Oettingen-Spielberg, who brought him a considerable fortune.

It previously served as the chief official residence of Wilhelm, Prince of Albania, and his wife, Princess Sophie of Sch√∂nburg-Waldenburg. It has been used by different Albanian governments for various purposes. History This royal residence had been the seat of the Ottoman prefect (mutasarriflik) of Durr√´s. The three floors of the building with an interior courtyard contained thirty-five rooms. Its facade was ca. 50 metres wide. Prince Wilhelm of Wied arrived in Albania at his capital of Durr√´s on March 7, 1914, along with the Royal Family. Wilhelm, who reigned as 'Vilhelm, Prince of Albania', moved into the building five months later and used it as his palace for his six month reign, when furnishing and a modest bevy of servants were brought from Germany. The palace was raided after the departure of Prince Wilhelm by Muslim rebels and Haxhi Qamili. On October 2, 1918, the palace, along with the entire city of Durr√´s, was bombarded on the orders Admiral Dominique-Marie Gauchet of the French Navy during the Battle of Durr√´s. The order was executed by Admiral The Marchese di Revel of the Regia Marina aboard the Dante Alighieri. Admiral Gauchet had followed the instructions of General Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey, who was serving the Macedonian front on account of the Allies, and according to whom, the Port of Durres, if not destroyed, would have served the evacuation of the Bulgarian and German armies involved in the First World War. The earthquake of 1926 further destroyed the palace and, by 1930, there were no longer any remains.

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 565 U.S. 171 (2012), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the court unanimously ruled that federal discrimination laws do not apply to religious organizations' selection of religious leaders..  Background  In 1999, Cheryl Perich started teaching at Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School, an affiliate of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod in Redford, Michigan. In addition to other duties, Perich led students in prayer and taught a religion class several days a week. In 2004, Perich left on disability and was diagnosed with narcolepsy. In 2005, after being cleared by her doctors to go back to work, the school told her that they already hired someone else. Perich then threatened to file suit, and so the school promptly fired her for \\"insubordination and disruptive behavior\\". Perich sued for unlawful dismissal under the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act.  Opinion of the Court  All nine Supreme Court justices agreed with the decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts that \\"the Establishment Clause prevents the Government from appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with the freedom of religious groups to select their own\\". Moreover, because the respondent in this case was a minister within the meaning of the ministerial exception, the First Amendment requires dismissal of her employment discrimination suit against her religious employer. The decision explicitly left open the question of whether religious organizations could be sued for other reasons: \\"We express no view on whether the exception bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of contract or tortious conduct\\". The Court also developed multiple factors to determine whether an employee qualifies as a minister within the meaning of the ministerial exception. These factors include how the school viewed the employee, the employee's title, and whether the employee's duties included important religious functions. Concurrences Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence, in which he eschewed the use of any specific test for determining who qualifies as a minister, writing that he would like to \\"defer to a religious organization's good-faith understanding of who qualifies as a minister\\". Justice Samuel Alito wrote a concurring opinion, which Elena Kagan joined, stating that the word \\"minister\\" used in the decision should extend to similar titles for other religions such as rabbi for Judaism or imam in Islam. Reaction Support The Family Research Council expressed support for the decision. In a press release, a spokesperson for the organization stated: \\"We are pleased that the Supreme Court rejected the Obama administration's profoundly troubling claim of power over churches, and glad to see that the Supreme Court has stayed out of the Lutheran Church's affairs and allowed its internal rules as a body of believers to stand.\\" (While FRC criticized the \\"Obama Administration\\", President Obama actually made no comment on the case, which was one the government began under the George W. Bush Administration. However, the Obama Administration, namely the Justice department, did in fact file an opposition brief that asserted the ministerial exemption should be severely limited). Five days following the decision, Mitt Romney praised the decision saying, \\"We are very fortunate [to have people] who are willing to stand up for religious tolerance and religious liberty and the First Amendment of this Constitution in this country.\\" Criticism In a January 12, 2012, editorial, the New York Times concluded that the decision gave \\"sweeping deference to churches\\" which \\"does not serve [churches] or society wisely\\": > Although the court does not provide much guidance on how to proceed in > future lawsuits against churches as employers, the ruling has broad sweep. > It abandons the court's longtime practice of balancing the interest in the > free exercise of religion against important government interests, like > protection against workplace bias or retaliation. With a balancing test, > courts consider whether a general law, if applied to a religious > institution, would inhibit its freedom more broadly than justified and, in > those circumstances, courts could exempt the church. In her brief, Ms. > Perich warned that expanding the ministerial exception to include workers > like her would allow a religious organization, for example, to retaliate > against a teacher for reporting sexual abuse of a student to the government. Impact In 2014, the Archdiocese of Cincinnati ordered its 2,000 teachers regardless of religion to sign a \\"detailed morality clause\\" that critics say focuses on \\"pelvic issues.\\" The new contracts forbids teachers from living together, having sex outside of marriage, using in-vitro fertilization or surrogacy, exhibiting a gay \\"lifestyle\\" or any speech expressing support for these things. Two cases originating from the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have challenged the applicability of Hossana-Tabor to teachers at religious schools who have ministerial duties but lack the title or training expected for such a position, leading to the Supreme Court case Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrisey-Berru. The July 2020 ruling on those cases rely on this one to conclude in favor of the schools against the teachers.

Colonel Edmond Petit, then Head of Information of the Air Force service and literary editor of the French Air Force magazine, published numerous articles campaigning in favor of such an institution since the year 1954. He saw it mainly as an academy for French language texts on aeronautics, where the French Academy was \\"completely incompetent\\" and as the place to be able to develop History of aviation.  The establishment of the Academy because of the reputation of Andr√© Turcat  This project could not be completed until 1983, in a broader form. It is the former chief test pilot of the Concorde, Andr√© Turcat, who got the National Academy of Air and Space out of limbo as much through his reputation within French aeronautics as well as with the municipal authorities of Toulouse.Acad√©mie de l‚Äôair et de l‚Äôespace, consult√© sur site www.desetoilesetdesailes.com le 10 janvier 2012 The material support of La Ville Rose allowed the installation of the Academy on the site of the former Jolimont observatory and, for the hundredth anniversary of the first human flight, the thirty five founding members gathered on 21 November 1983, in a plenary assembly. Incorporated under the association law of 1901, declared a public utility in 1987, the Academy has declared its objectives to \\"encourage the development of high quality scientific, technical, cultural and human actions in the realms of Air and Space, promote knowledge in these areas and constitute a focal point for activities.\\"  International Influence  The Academy organizes international conferences and forums, presents exhibitions, gives out awards or medals to people who have made distinguished contributions. It regularly publishes, every two or three months, \\"The Letter of the Academy\\" presenting several pages on a relevant aeronautical subject. Works on a larger scale result in publications by the Academy itself (as papers) or by private publishers (as books). By statute, the Air and Space Academy has sixty French members, thirty foreign associates, honorary members (chosen from amongst the pioneers of aeronautics and space), and correspondents who ensure an ongoing connection to the current activities of the aerospace world. Its members become honorary at the age of 75 or upon their request, while continuing, at their convenience, to take part in the work of the Academy. Members may join different sections according to their speciality. These five areas are: # scientific knowledge of air and space # applied sciences and technology of air and space # human presence and activities of air and space # ethics, law, sociology, and economics of air and space # history, literature, and arts of air and space At the request of one of the tenured or honorary members, committees may be established to deal with current issues.

The first tram route ran from High Street in the city centre to the Docks run by the Cardiff Tramway Company. In 1898, Cardiff County Borough Council obtained Parliamentary powers to take over all the tramways in the area, and to use new electric trams, owning them from 1903. The routes formally opened on 1 May 1902. In 1904, more than 23 million passengers had been carried in that year, up from 18 million the previous year. and when Cardiff became a city in 1905, 131 electric trams were operating on the network, mainly focusing on the busy Cardiff Docks. In 1928, the network peaked at 142 cars and 19.51 miles (31.3 km) route miles.Priestley, Henry B. (1977). \\"Cardiff's Electric Tramways\\". Tramway Review, Vol. 12, No. 91, Autumn 1977. Traffic and receipts were buoyant; during the year ending 31 March 1928 passengers totalled 42,440,000 with receipts of ¬£265,028. Car miles had reached 3,490,000. By 1929, the tram network stretched from Victoria Park in the west, to Grangetown and Cardiff Docks in the south, to Roath and Splott in the east, and to Gabalfa in the north. The city council refused motor buses in 1907 but allowed them in 1910, operating its own from 1920, although 81 tramcars were introduced by Cardiff Corporation Transport to negotiate the city's low railway bridges. By 1939, these vehicles were becoming worn out and it was decided to phase out tramcars. From 1902 until 1943, conductors on each tram collected fares but this was later replaced with a pay-as-you-enter system, with fares costing 1d. Closure The system was closed on 20 January 1950,Western Mail, 20 January 1950. when electric trams were replaced with electric trolleybuses. A short section of tramway, as well as an electrified tram, are kept on Cardiff Model Engineering Society grounds in Heath Park, where visitors can ride the tram.

Morgan, Jacob H. Schiff, August Belmont, Jr. and Cornelius Vanderbilt II. Today, Provident Loan Society of New York provides short-term cash loans to individuals secured by gold and diamond jewelry, fine watches and silverware and is America's last remaining not-for-profit loan society created during the economic crisis of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Caskey, John P. (1996) Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops, and the Poor, New York: Russell Sage Foundation. p.24. __TOC__ The society's former building on Houston St and Essex Street was owned for a time by the artist Jasper Johns, who used it as a studio. It was then turned into a nightclub and lounge, which has since been closed. History The Provident Loan Society of New York was created during the financial panic of 1893. In an uncertain economic environment amid foreclosures and bank failures, people sought cash from unregulated loan sharks and pawnbrokers. As a result, a group of powerful New York bankers and financiers pooled money together, pledging $35,000 each to establish a not-for-profit organization to provide short-term loans at a lower rate than the loan sharks. The organization was modeled on European financial institutions known as mont de pi√©t√© (mount of piety). The contributors included Solomon Loeb, Alfred B. Mason, J. P. Morgan, Gustav Schwab, Jacob H. Schiff, James Speyer, Seth Low and Cornelius Vanderbilt II, among others. The New York State Legislature passed a special act in 1894 incorporating The Provident Loan Society of New York. At its peak in 1962, the Society had seventeen locations around New York. As of 2017, there were five remaining locations.\\"Locations\\" Provident Loan Society website] East 72nd Street Present Today, Provident Loan states that it serves approximately 100,000 people annually. The maximum amount that the institution will loan is $100,000 for a term of six months at an annual interest rate of 26%. New York State laws governing pawnbrokers allow pawn shops to charge up to 48% annually. Provident Loan will not buy merchandise, however, only lend against its value. The Society maintains five locations: two in Manhattan - at its headquarters at 346 Park Avenue South and at 180 East 72nd Street; one in the Fordham section of the Bronx, at 2573 Decatur Avenue; one in Queens, at 136-48 39th Avenue in Flushing, and one in Brooklyn, at 7804 Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge. The San Francisco Provident Loan Association's building at 932 Mission Street in San Francisco Other organizations In 1912, prominent civic, financial and social leaders in San Francisco - the Hellman, Crocker, and Fleishhacker families were represented - founded the San Francisco Remedial Loan Association based on the model of the Provident Loan Society of New York. The organization changed its name to the San Francisco Provident Loan Association, and is still located in its original historic landmark building - also modeled on the New York society's building - at 932 Mission Street on the corner of Mint Street in the South of Market (SoMa) neighborhood of the city. Unlike the New York society, which remains a not-for-profit organization, the San Francisco association is now family-owned and operated. The business was bought by Frank Rusalem in 1954 and sold to Robert Chait in 1965. Since then, three generations of the Chait family have run the concern.

The original Tea Room opened in 1913 and was replaced in 1927. The building installed the first escalator in Iowa, known as the \\"electric stairs\\", in this building in 1939. Younkers closed their downtown Des Moines location on August 12, 2005. Part of the building was destroyed in a fire during the early morning hours of March 29, 2014, that caused the upper floors of the building to collapse. At the time of the fire, the building was undergoing renovation into 120 apartments and retail space. While no cause of the fire has been announced, the ATF had ruled out arson as a possible cause following an investigation shortly after the fire. Demolition of the eastern part of the building began a short time later. In August 2014, the Alexander Company, a Wisconsin-based developer, announced plans to continue with the ongoing renovation and restoration of the western half of the building. The revised plans call for adding 14,000 square feet of commercial space on the first floor of the building, creating 60 apartment units on the remaining floors, and renovating the historic Tea Room, which was spared during the fire.

The Fredericksburg and Northern Railway was a connector line between Fredericksburg, Texas, and the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway. It operated under that name from 1917 until 1942. From 1913 to 1917, it was operated as the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway. History After the Civil War, Fredericksburg wanted to connect to the existing San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway for a speedier method of delivering their products to the San Antonio marketplace. After the disappointment of the SA&AP; building a connector line only as far as Kerrville, businessmen in Fredericksburg began to formulate a plan to raise capital to build a line connecting with the SA&AP.; $30,000 in capital stock was issued. An additional $200,000 cash was raised to pay the contractor to build the line. In 1913, the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway Company was chartered. A tunnel was built through an intervening hill. The first train rolled down the line and through the new tunnel on August 16, 1913. Cain City was originally established as a stop for the new line. The cost of building the rail line sent the new company into receivership in 1914. The railway was deeded over to the newly chartered Fredericksburg and Northern Railway Company by Martin Carle, who had purchased the property December 31, 1917, under a foreclosure sale. The F&N; line continued to operate until World War II, but failed to turn enough profit to pay off the original debt incurred in 1917 for its purchase. On July 25, 1942, the United States War Department approved the application of owner Dr. O. H. Judkins to cease operations of the railway. The track was sold for scrap. The tunnel is now home for up to three million Mexican free-tailed bats and 3,000 cave myotis from May through October. The tunnel and surrounding land is part of Old Tunnel State Park.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. History The painting and its companion, Hunting, were included in Charles Le Brun's inventory in 1683, and in November 1695 they were in the apartments of King Louis XIV's younger brother. It was no doubt for this purpose that they were given two sumptuous gilt frames, each with attributes suited to the subject of the painting - among the finest examples of the art of frame-making in the time of Louis XIV. In 1955, when the varnish was being cleaned, the 19th century gilding covering the original gilding was removed - a task of some magnitude which was carried out by the French firm of Lebrun.H. Loyrette, The Louvre: All the Paintings, Black Dog & Leventhal (2011), s.v. Carracci. This work, together with its companion, date from Carracci's Bolognese period, before he left for Rome in 1595 to paint at the Galleria Farnese. At this time he was extremely interested in landscape, and his experiments are a foreshadowing of Poussin's classical compositions; but in these pictures he is exploring in a different direction, in the tradition of the Bassani, a family of painters whose studios continued to turn out landscapes which were prized all over Europe. His interest was the countryside. Without any religious theme as pretext, he painted two pure landscapes whose true subjects are the forest and the river, motivated by the themes of hunting and fishing. Therefore, Carracci was able to show nature animated with the life of the aristocracy and of ordinary people. The composition follows the visual device of division into compartments.H. Loyrette, ibid., Ch.I, Italian School. Hunting Scene by Annibale Carracci (before 1595), 1.36 m x 2.53 m Together with the Galleria Farnese, the two thematic paintings are Carracci's greatest masterpieces, and have always been much admired by artists.

It has the subtitle \\"The Story of a Simple Man\\" (\\"Roman eines einfachen Mannes\\"). It tells the story of an orthodox Jew whose faith is weakened when he moves from Tsarist Russia to New York City. The story is based on the Book of Job. Reception The book was reviewed in The New York Times in 1931, where the critic compared it to the author's previous works: \\"Roth's development as a novelist has shown a gradual abandonment of problem and political themes such as filled Rechts und Links. Flucht Ohne Ende (Flight Without End) contains evidence of a growing inner life[.] ... Im [sic] Job, finally, he seems to admit that literature must follow upon, not lead, social change; and consequently he has turned his eyes inward upon his spiritual self, and backward upon tradition. He has written a work of the type that literary chroniclers like to call pure.\\" The critic wrote about the book's relation to its source material: \\"It is the old, familiar book of Job, reworked in modern symbols. As with other great legends, the drama is weakened by modernization, but the lyrical quality of the prose and the innate wisdom of the author help us to forget that.\\" The review ended: \\"there seldom has appeared a book in which each word is burdened so heavily with music and meaning. For its tenderness and beauty alone, Job deserves a wide audience.\\" Harriet Porter of The Guardian reviewed the book in 2000: \\"Roth captures essential truths about faith, hope and despair within his reworking of a Biblical story. His writing is rich without being dense, and has a fable-like directness.\\" The composer Erich Zeisl commenced an opera based on the novel, and this was completed by the Polish composer Jan Duszynski and produced as Zeisls Hiob in Munich in 2014.

Chorale words by Thomas Oliphant All Ye Who Music Love (SATB) , Wisconsin Music Educators Association. Oliphant wrote the words to \\"Deck the Hall(s) with Boughs of Holly\\".\\"Welsh Melodies\\" Publisher: Addison, Hollier and Lucas; Lamborn Cock and Co.; J.B. Cramer & Co (London). Vols. 1&2 published in 1862. Vol 3 in 1870 and vol. 4 in 1874 Crystal Palace at Sydenham drawn between 1855 and 1860. The original is in his family's collection. Family Background Thomas was the fifth son of Ebenezer Oliphant, 7th of Condie and Mary, 3rd daughter of Sir William Stirling, Bt. of Ardoch, Perth and Kinross. Thomas was baptised at Forgandenny on Christmas Day in 1799.Burke's Landed Gentry 19th Edition, The Kingdom in ScotlandBurke's Peerage & Baronetage 107th Edition Drawing of Newton of Condie by Thomas Oliphant (circa 1853), his birthplace and ancestral home. Oliphant was closely related to Carolina Oliphant, Lady Nairne. Oliphant had a total of six brothers and sisters. His eldest brother was Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie, Member of Parliament for Perth from 1832 to 1837. Another older brother, Sir Anthony Oliphant, was Chief Justice of Ceylon. A third brother, Lt. Col. James Oliphant, was Chairman of the Honourable East India Company and it is from this brother that the present chiefly line of Oliphants descend. Thomas died unmarried on 9 March 1873 in Great Marlborough Street.Dictionary of National Biography Early life Oliphant was educated at Winchester College but left early. He became a member of the London Stock Exchange but after a short time left to pursue his interest in music and literature. The Madrigal Society In 1830 Oliphant was admitted a member of the Madrigal Society and in 1832 he became the Honorary Secretary of the society, a position which he held for 39 years, eventually becoming first the Vice-President and then a year later President of the Society in 1871. He wrote English words to a considerable number of Italian Madrigals for the Society's use, in some instances his words were translations but in many, they were his own creation. Musical career Like his more famous cousin, Oliphant was primarily a lyricist, writing his own new words or his own interpretations to his \\"translations\\" of existing songs in foreign languages. Oliphant took part in the Great Handel festival in Westminster Abbey in the chorus as the bass vocalist. In 1855, he was asked by the directors of the Philharmonic Society to translate portions of Wagner's opera Lohengrin which were then performed by the Philharmonic Society's (now known as the Royal Philharmonic Society) orchestra and chorus at the Hanover Square Rooms and conducted by Wagner himself. Oliphant wrote the words for the chorale for the wedding of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1863. The music was composed by Prince Albert and when Queen Victoria heard the recital, she was said to have been much affected by the chorale as Prince Albert had died over a year before in 1861. Oliphant was described as the \\"Poet of the Court\\", as he wrote lyrics for Royal events and other important occasions.Arts and sciences: or, Fourth division of \\"The English encyclopedia\\", Volume 2, page 378. Edited by Charles Knight (1866) In Victorian Britain the vogue for translating foreign lyrics into English was popular. It was a pastime at which Oliphant was prodigious. Oliphant's position in the music world has diminished to the point where he is largely unknown but in his lifetime his standing was significant. An illustration of this is a letter in The Musical World dated October 1869, concerning someone else's transgression: \\"We shall next have the musical knowledge of Hogarth called into question or the profundity of Parry; or the orchestral skill of Hullah; or the madrigalian researches of Oliphant; or the genius of Louis Emmanuel; or the modesty of Eliason....\\". In spite of his extensive interpretations of German songs, it would appear that, at one time at least, Oliphant did not speak German. As one of his friends and contemporaries put it: \\"Many a popular drawing-room song of those days bore on its title-page the intimation, ' Words by Thomas Oliphant, Esq.' Tom knew no German, and when he was told of a song in that noble tongue which was likely to suit him commercially, he asked me to give him a bare English prose translation of it, which he then turned into metre..... 'The Standard-Bearer' was one of the most successful of the many prose-skeleton songs of which I thus furnished him.\\" Literary recollections and sketches by Francis Espinasse Given the quantity of \\"translations\\" which Oliphant produced, it is hard to see how he could not have gained some knowledge of German in the process. Oliphant also drew from Welsh, French, Italian and other languages, it is possible that he was not fully conversant in these languages either (nevertheless it is known from his collection of Italian sketches, that he did at some stage travel in Italy), which is probably partly why his English verses are not translations but his own interpretations. \\"Nos Gallen\\" is a notable example, since it is a New Year's Eve song, which Oliphant turned into the Christmas carol \\"Deck the Hall\\" (although he published it as \\"Nos Gallen\\" in 1862 and it has since become known by its first line). Oliphant commissioned eighteen works by John Liptrot Hatton who worked under the pseudonym of 'P.B. Czapek' (alluding to the Hungarian word for a Hat, for 'Hatton'). These compositions were based on the style of German classics.Fuller-Maitland, 'Hatton, John Liptrot', Old D.N.B. Simpson, A Century of Ballads, p. 125. Following Oliphant's death in 1873, his valuable music collection was sold by Messrs. Puttick and Simpson.Alec Hyatt King, Some British Collectors of Music, c. 1600‚Äì1960 (Cambridge University Press 1963), pp. 37‚Äì59 passim, at p. 59.

Other Appointments In 1841 Oliphant was appointed to catalogue MS and printed music at the British Museum by Anthony Panizzi. By 1842 he had completed the first catalogue of the manuscript music. He began the cataloguing of the printed music which he completed by 1849. Oliphant resigned from the British Museum in 1850 as a result of a \\"run-in\\" with Panizzi. In 1852 he became librarian to the Musical Institute of London. In the 1860s he was arranging musical productions at Crystal Palace. He was also an Auditor of the Royal Society of Female Musicians and of the National Opera Company. Oliphant was also Literary Illustrator of the London Glee and Madrigal Union in 1860 and 1861. Art On leaving the British Museum, Oliphant returned to his childhood home in Scotland. Between 1850 and 1860 Oliphant completed three (known) volumes of sketches. The first is a visual record of pencil sketches of landscapes and buildings as he journeyed through Orkney, Shetland, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross-shire, Inverness-shire and Perthshire, 1852. The second volume actually starts in 1850 with drawings of his ancestral home and is a series of sketches of landscapes mainly around Strathearn but also charts his journey to the West Coast of Scotland in 1853, the Isle of Man and his journey back to the South of Englandfamily collection and the last is a collection of sketches of Crystal Palace between 1855 and 1860. What makes the last volume interesting is that John Jones (Talhaiarn) with whom Oliphant collaborated on all four volumes of \\"Welsh Melodies\\" (1862‚Äì1874) was for a while an architect who worked on Crystal Palace under Sir Joseph Paxton. Oliphant returned to Scotland the year after for another purpose. His brother, Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie and 30th Chief of Clan Oliphant, was involved in (what turned into a twenty one year) legal battle to be recognised as heir to his cousin's estate. In a genealogical chart, re-drawn in 1889, are the words: \\"sed Chartum virginum ex variis documentis antiquis Thomas Oliphant A.D. 1854 collegit:-\\"currently in his family's ownership Publications 1834 \\"Comments of a Chorus Singer at the Royal Musical Festival at Westminster Abbey\\" under the pseudonym Saloman Sackbut. 1835 \\"A Brief Account of the Madrigal Society\\". 1836 \\"A Short Account of Madrigals\\". 1837 \\"La Musa Madrigalesca\\".

The deepest point of the basin is the endorheic Lake Turkana, a brackish Soda lake with a very high ecological productivity in the Gregory Rift. A narrower definition for the term Turkana Basin is also in widespread use and means Lake Turkana and its environment within the confines of the Gregory Rift in Kenya and Ethiopia. This includes the lower Omo River valley in Ethiopia. The Basin in the narrower definition is a site of geological subsidence containing one of the most continuous and temporally well controlled fossil records of the Plio- PleistoceneFeibel, C., 2011, \\"A Geological History of the Turkana Basin.\\" Evolutionary Anthropology. with some fossils as old as the Cretaceous. Among the Basin's critical fossiliferous sites are Lothagam, Allia Bay, and Koobi Fora.  Geography  Lake Turkana sits at the center of the Turkana Basin and is flanked by the Chalbi Desert to the east, the Lotakipi Plains to the north, Karasuk to the west and Samburu to the south.\\"Atlas of Kenya,\\" Ed. D. E. Warren, The Survey of Kenya, Nairobi 1962. Included within these regions are desert scrub, desert grass and shrubland, and scattered Acacia or open grasslands. The only true Perennial River is the Omo River in Ethiopia in the northern part of the basin which discharges into the lake on its northern shore and supplies the lake with more than 98% of its annual water inflow. The two Intermittent rivers which almost alone contribute the remaining 2% of water inflow are the Turkwel River and the Kerio River in Kenya in the western part of the basin. Much of the Turkana Basin today can be described as arid scrubland or even desert. The exception is the Omo-Gibe River valley to the north. Important towns within the Turkana Basin include Lokitaung, Kakuma, Lodwar, Lorogumu, Ileret and Kargi. The Turkana people inhabit the west of the Basin, the Samburu and Pokot people inhabit the south, and the Nyangatom, Daasanach and Borana Oromo peoples inhabit the north and east.  Geological setting  Flamingo lake on Central island in Lake Turkana The oldest sedimentary records go back to the Cretaceous, including units previously informally referred to as the Turkana grits like the Lapurr Sandstone and are dominated by eastward flowing fluvial sequences draining into the Indian Ocean; later formations from the Oligocene and Miocene are characterised by similar fluvial regimes that are not however unified under a single geological group or system.Boschetto, H. B., Brown, F. H., McDougall, I., 1992. \\"Stratigraphy of the Lothidok Range, northern Kenya, and K/Ar ages of its Miocene primates.\\" Journal of Human Evolution, vol.22 pp.47‚Äì71.Leakey, M. G., Feibel, C. S., Bernor, R. L., Harris, J. M., Cerling, T. E., Stewart K. M., Storrs, G. W., Walker, A., Werdelin, L., and A. J. Winkler, 1996, \\"Lothagam: A Record of Faunal Change in the Late Miocene of East Africa.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, vol.16 no.3 pp.556‚Äì570. Approximately 4.2 million years ago (Ma) the region experienced widespread and significant volcanism, associated with the Gombe basalts in the Koobi Fora formation to the east and with the Lothagam basalts further south; this event created a lake in the center of the basin and apparently established the modern, continuous depositional system of the Turkana Basin. Deposition in the Turkana Basin overall is driven primarily by subsidence, a result of rifting between the Somali and Nubian plates that has created a series of horst and graben structures, and led to approximately 1 km of sedimentary deposits at the center of the basin every 1 million years. Sedimentary records, which become more sparse and discontinuous at greater distance from the basin center, suggest that the basin has alternated between fluvial and lacustrine regimes throughout the Plio-Pleistocene, primarily as a result of continued volcanic activity first to the east, and later to the south of the basin.Bruhn, R. L., Brown, F. H., Gathogo, P. N., Haileab, B., 2011, \\"Pliocene volcano-tectonics and paleogeography of the Turkana Basin, Kenya and Ethiopia,\\" Journal of African Earth Sciences, vol.59, pp.295‚Äì312.  Evolutionary record  Fossil records in the basin help establish much of what is known about African faunal evolution in the Neogene and Quaternary.Werdelin, L. and W. J. Sanders, Eds., \\"Cenozoic Mammals of Africa.\\" University of California Press: 2010. As in other regions, the end-Miocene Messinian aridification crisis and global cooling trend seem to have influenced fossil assemblages in the Turkana Basin, either through migrations or de novo evolutionary events.Blois, J. L. and Hadly, E. A., 2009. \\"Mammalian response to Cenozoic climate change.\\" Annual Reviews in Earth and Planetary Sciences, vol.37 pp.181‚Äì208. Fossilized leaves characteristic of more mesic landscapes, faunal community compositions, and increase \\"C4\\" or arid-adapted plant contribution to herbivore carbon intake, all suggest that the Miocene world was more lush than the Pliocene.Cerling, T.E., Harris, J.M., MacFadden, B. J., Leakey, M. G., Quade, J., Eisenmann, V. and Ehleringer, J. R., 1997, \\"Global vegetation change through the Miocene/Pliocene boundary.\\" Nature, vol.389 pp.153‚Äì158. Some herbivores, like horses, responded rapidly to the spread of C4 grasslands, while other herbivores evolved more slowly, or developed a number of different responses to an increasingly arid landscape.Uno, Cerling, Harris et al, \\"Late Miocene to Pliocene carbon isotope record of differential diet change among East African herbivores.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol.108 no.16 pp.6509‚Äì6514. Evolutionary studies of the Turkana Basin have found what may be major intervals of faunal turnover after the Miocene as well, most notably in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene,Vrba, E.S., 1995b. \\"The Fossil Record of African Antelopes (Mammalia, Bovidae) in Relation to Human Evolution and Paleoclimate.\\" In ES Vrba, GH Denton, TC Partridge and LH Buckle (eds): Paleoclimate and Evolution with Emphasis on Human Origins.

E., Fleagle, J. G. and Leakey, R. E., Eds., \\"The First Humans ‚Äì Origin and Early Evolution of the Genus Homo,\\" pp.173‚Äì184, Springer, 2009. One cause of focus on the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene is the large literature on hominin fossil remains showing an apparent \\"adaptive radiation\\" across this boundary. While previous hominin species are considered to be part of a single, continuously evolving \\"anagenetic\\" lineage,Kimbel, W. H., C. A.

The earliest putative evidence for stone tool use among human ancestors is found within the Turkana Basin.McPherron, S. P., Alemseged, Z., Marean, C. W., Wynn, J.

Our team performed well, exceeding previous results and achieving what we‚Äôd hoped for, to make the team final for the first time.

The Museum is focused on a specific aspect of Canadian military history: the Citizen Soldier (the Militiaman and Reservist) at peace and at war. The Museum uses vehicles and artifacts to demonstrate how they could be adapted and used by Citizen Soldiers for both military and civilian purposes. For example, a Ram tank from World War II that was modified after the war to serve as a snowplow was a featured display at the Museum for many years. Amongst the artifacts and equipment that the Museum displays is a 1942 Bofors 40mm Light Anti-Aircraft Gun which is maintained as a living monument and memorial for Canadian anti-aircraft gunners.  History The Museum was originally formed in 1987 by Captain (now Major) M.T. Calnan and Captain M.J. Hilash, military history enthusiasts and private collectors of militaria. The two combined their efforts and collections to form the Swords and Ploughshares Museum so that they could display their artifacts and further public knowledge of Canadian military history. Land was purchased south of Kars, Ontario in the late 1980s with construction of a steel building to house the vehicles following in the summer of 1991. Colonel Michael David Calnan, CD served as the Honorary Chairman of the Museum from its founding in 1987 until he passed away in 2018.\\"Obituary - Col. M.D. Calnan\\" Retrieved 25 February 2019  Outreach program  The Museum does not have a large number of fixed displays and prefers to use living history practices to provide interactive displays and demonstrations. This includes participating along with historical re- enactors in special commemorative events such as the 50th Anniversary of D-day Parade held in Ottawa in 1994 and the 64th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain held at the National Aviation Museum in 2004. The Museum regularly coordinates Canada Day parades in nearby communities such as Kemptville and Merrickville as well as in other events such as the Richmond Fair and the Kars Fair.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng1bu72I9gI Historic military vehicle owners from Eastern Ontario volunteer their time and vehicles for the parades.

Frishberg wrote both the lyrics and the music. The song, released in 1969, was distributed by Red Day Division of Doramus, Inc. under CTI Records. It was originally released as a single, but was later incorporated into Frishberg's LP, Oklahoma Toad. Development Van Lingle Mungo in 1940 Frishberg developed the melody first, but couldn't settle on lyrics, rejecting several sets of lyrics he drafted. Frishberg browsed through a copy of a baseball encyclopedia, which lists the names of players in Major League Baseball. In the encyclopedia, he found the name of Van Lingle Mungo, a name he found unusual. He later found himself humming Mungo's name to the melody. From there, Frishberg found more names in the encyclopedia that he found interesting. He proceeded to write song lyrics for the melody that included only the names of major league players and the words \\"and\\" and \\"big\\", attempting to order the names in a rhyming fashion. The song is performed in bossa nova style. The players mentioned in most versions of the song, in addition to Mungo, are: *John Antonelli *Eddie Basinski *Augie Bergamo *Frenchy Bordagaray *Lou Boudreau *Harry Brecheen *Roy Campanella *Phil Cavarretta *Frankie Crosetti *Bobby Estalella *Ferris Fain *Augie Galan *Danny Gardella *Johnny Gee *Frankie Gustine *Stan Hack *Sig Jakucki *Eddie Joost *Whitey Kurowski *Max Lanier *Thornton Lee *Ernie Lombardi * \\"Heeney\\" Hank Majeski *Pinky May *Barney McCosky *George McQuinn *Johnny Mize *Hugh Mulcahy *Claude Passeau *Johnny Pesky *Howard Pollet *Johnny Sain *Hal Trosky *Johnny Vander Meer *Eddie Waitkus *Early Wynn In certain versions of the song, a few names change. On the \\"Retromania: At The Jazz Bakery\\" album which contains a later recording of the song, Frishberg substitutes Art Passarella in place of Roy Campanella.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tvphgpl_K8 On an early recording that coincided with the release of the \\"Oklahoma Toad\\" album, Frishberg replaces the mellifluous Lou Boudreau and Claude Passeau with Virgil Trucks and Johnny Kucks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-R4Frfp0YQ With the death of John Antonelli (usually listed as \\"Johnny\\") on February 28, 2020, Eddie Basinski is the last surviving player mentioned in the song. Reception Jazz critic and author Ira Gitler considers \\"Van Lingle Mungo\\" as \\"one of the best jazz works of the 70s and certainly the best ever done combining jazz and baseball.\\" The song has been entered in the National Baseball Library, a section of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. \\"Van Lingle Mungo\\" was included in Baseball's Greatest Hits, a 1990 compilation of baseball-themed songs. Mungo and his wife reported that they both enjoyed the song.

Ahlfors was awarded one of the two very first Fields Medals for this theory in 1936. It can be considered as a generalization of the basic properties of covering maps to the maps which are \\"almost coverings\\" in some well defined sense. It applies to bordered Riemann surfaces equipped with conformal Riemannian metrics. Preliminaries A bordered Riemann surface X can be defined as a region on a compact Riemann surface whose boundary ‚àÇX consists of finitely many disjoint Jordan curves. In most applications these curves are piecewise analytic, but there is some explicit minimal regularity condition on these curves which is necessary to make the theory work; it is called the Ahlfors regularity. A conformal Riemannian metric is defined by a length element ds which is expressed in conformal local coordinates z as ds = œÅ(z) |dz|, where œÅ is a smooth positive function with isolated zeros. If the zeros are absent, then the metric is called smooth. The length element defines the lengths of rectifiable curves and areas of regions by the formulas : \\\\ell(\\\\gamma)=\\\\int_\\\\gamma \\\\rho(z) \\\\, |dz|,\\\\quad A(D)=\\\\int_D\\\\rho^2(x+iy) \\\\, dx \\\\, dy, \\\\quad z=x+iy. Then the distance between two points is defined as the infimum of the lengths of the curves connecting these points. Setting and notation Let X and Y be two bordered Riemann surfaces, and suppose that Y is equipped with a smooth (including the boundary) conformal metric œÉ(z) dz. Let f be a holomorphic map from X to Y. Then there exists the pull-back metric on X, which is defined by : \\\\rho(z)|dz|=\\\\sigma(f(z))|f^{\\\\prime}(z)||dz|. \\\\, When X is equipped with this metric, f becomes a local isometry, that is the length of a curve equals to the length of its image. All lengths and areas on X and Y are measured with respect to these two metrics. If f sends the boundary of X to the boundary of Y, then f is a ramified covering. In particular, :a) Each point has the same (finite) number of preimages, counting multiplicity. This number is the degree of the covering. :b) The Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula holds, in particular, the Euler characteristic of X is at most the Euler characteristic of Y times the degree. Now suppose that some part of the boundary of X is mapped to the interior of Y. This part is called the relative boundary. Let L be the length of this relative boundary. First main theorem The average covering number is defined by the formula : S=\\\\frac{A(X)}{A(Y)}. This number is a generalization of the degree of a covering. Similarly, for every regular curve Œ≥ and for every regular region D in Y the average covering numbers are defined: : S(D)=\\\\frac{A(f^{-1}(D))}{A(D)},\\\\quad S(\\\\gamma)=\\\\frac{\\\\ell(f^{-1}(\\\\gamma))}{\\\\ell(\\\\gamma)}. The First Main Theorem says that for every regular region and every regular curve, : |S-S(D)|\\\\leq kL,\\\\quad |S-S(\\\\gamma)|\\\\leq kL, where L is the length of the relative boundary, and k is the constant that may depend only on Y, œÉ, D and Œ≥, but is independent of f and X. When L = 0 these inequalities become a weak analog of the property a) of coverings. Second main theorem Let œÅ be the negative of the Euler characteristic (so that œÅ = m ‚àí 2 for the sphere with m holes). Then : \\\\max\\\\\\\\{\\\\rho(X),0\\\\\\\\}\\\\geq S\\\\rho(Y)-kL, \\\\, This is meaningful only when œÅ(Y) > 0, for example when Y is a sphere with three (or more) holes. In this case, the result can be considered as a generalization of the property b) of coverings. Applications Suppose now that Z is an open Riemann surface, for example the complex plane or the unit disc, and let Z be equipped with a conformal metric ds. We say that (Z,ds) is regularly exhaustible if there is an increasing sequence of bordered surfaces Dj contained in Z with their closures, whose union in Z, and such that : \\\\frac{\\\\ell(\\\\partial(D_j))}{A(D_j)}\\\\to 0,\\\\; j\\\\to\\\\infty. Ahlfors proved that the complex plane with arbitrary conformal metric is regularly exhaustible. This fact, together with the two main theorems implies Picard's theorem, and the Second main theorem of Nevanlinna theory. Many other important generalizations of Picard's theorem can be obtained from Ahlfors theory. One especially striking result (conjectured earlier by Andr√© Bloch) is the Five Island theorem. Five-island theorem Let D1,...,D5 be five Jordan regions on the Riemann sphere with disjoint closures. Then there exists a constant c, depending only on these regions, and having the following property: Let f be a meromorphic function in the unit disc such that the spherical derivative satisfies : \\\\frac{|f'(0)|}{1+|f(0)|^2}\\\\geq c. Then there is a simply connected region G contained with its closure in the unit disc, such that f maps G onto one of the regions Dj homeomorphically. This does not hold with four regions. Take, for example f(z) = ‚Ñò(Kz), where K > 0 is arbitrarily large, and ‚Ñò is the Weierstrass elliptic function satisfying the differential equation : (\\\\wp^\\\\prime)^2=4(\\\\wp-e_1)(\\\\wp-e_2)(\\\\wp-e_3). All preimages of the four points e1,e2,e3,‚àû are multiple, so if we take four discs with disjoint closures around these points, there will be no region which is mapped on any of these discs homeomorphically. Remarks Besides Ahlfors' original journal paper, the theory is explained in books. Simplified proofs of the Second Main Theorem can be found in the papers of Toki and de Thelin. A simple proof of the Five Island Theorem, not relying on Ahlfors' theory, was developed by Bergweiler.

Co-citation, like Bibliographic Coupling, is a semantic similarity measure for documents that makes use of citation relationships. Co-citation is defined as the frequency with which two documents are cited together by other documents.Henry Small, 1973 \\"Co-citation in the scientific literature: a new measure of the relationship between two documents\\" . Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 24:265‚Äì269. If at least one other document cites two documents in common these documents are said to be co-cited. The more co- citations two documents receive, the higher their co-citation strength, and the more likely they are semantically related. The figure to the right illustrates the concept of co-citation and a more recent variation of co- citation which accounts for the placement of citations in the full text of documents. The figure's left image shows the Documents A and B, which are both cited by Documents C, D and E; thus Documents A and B have a co-citation strength, or co-citation indexJeppe Nicolaisen, Co-citation , in Birger Hj√∏rland, ed., Core Concepts in Library and Information Science of three. This score is usually established using citation indexes. Documents featuring high numbers of co-citations are regarded as more similar.Henry Small, 1973. \\"Co-citation in the scientific literature: A new measure of the relationship between two documents\\" . Journal of the American Society for Information Science (JASIS), volume 24(4), pp. 265-269. doi = 10.1002/asi.4630240406 The figure's right image shows a citing document which cites the Documents 1, 2 and 3. Both the Documents 1 and 2 and the Documents 2 and 3 have a co-citation strength of one, given that they are cited together by exactly one other document. However, Documents 2 and 3 are cited in much closer proximity to each other in the citing document compared to Document 1. To make co-citation a more meaningful measure in this case, a Co-Citation Proximity Index (CPI) can be introduced to account for the placement of citations relative to each other. Documents co-cited at greater relative distances in the full text receive lower CPI values.Bela Gipp and Joeran Beel, 2009 \\"Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) ‚Äì A new approach for identifying related work based on Co- Citation Analysis\\" in Birger Larsen and Jacqueline Leta, editors, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI‚Äô09), volume 2, pages 571‚Äì575, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), July 2009. Gipp and Beel were the first to propose using modified co-citation weights based on proximity.Kevin W.

In the adjacent diagram, for example, Doc A and Doc B may still be co-cited by future documents, say Doc F and Doc G. This characteristic of co-citation allows for a dynamic document classification system when compared to Bibliographic Coupling. Over the decades, researchers proposed variants or enhancements to the original co-citation concept. Howard White introduced author co-citation analysis in 1981.Howard D. White and Belver C.

Co-citation Proximity Analysis considers the proximity of citations within the full-texts for similarity computation and therefore allows for a more fine-grained assessment of semantic document similarity than pure co-citation.M. Schwarzer, M. Schubotz, N. Meuschke, C. Breitinger, V. Markl, and B. Gipp, \\"Evaluating Link- based Recommendations for Wikipedia\\" in Proceedings of the 16th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), New York, NY, USA, 2016, pp. 191-200. Considerations The motivations of authors for citing literature can vary greatly and occur for a variety of reasons aside from simply referring to academically relevant documents. Cole and Cole expressed this concern based on the observation that scientists tend to cite friends and research colleges more frequently, a partiality known as cronyism.Cole, J. R. & Cole, S., 1973. \\"Social Stratification in Science\\". Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. Additionally, it has been observed that academic works which have already gained much credit and reputation in a field tend to receive even more credit and thus citations in future literature, an observation termed the Matthew effect in science.

It is currently held and exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. History The painting and its companion, Fishing, were included in Charles Le Brun's inventory in 1683, and in November 1695 they were in the apartments of King Louis XIV's younger brother. It was no doubt for this purpose that they were given two sumptuous gilt frames, each with attributes suited to the subject of the painting ‚Äì among the finest examples of the art of frame-making in the time of Louis XIV. In 1955, when the varnish was being cleaned, the 19th century gilding covering the original gilding was removed ‚Äì a task of some magnitude which was carried out by the French firm of Lebrun.H. Loyrette, The Louvre: All the Paintings, Black Dog & Leventhal (2011), s.v. Carracci. This work, together with its companion, date from Carracci's Bolognese period, before he left for Rome in 1595 to paint at the Galleria Farnese. At this time he was extremely interested in landscape, and his experiments are a foreshadowing of Poussin's classical compositions; but in these pictures he is exploring in a different direction, in the tradition of the Bassani, a family of painters whose studios continued to turn out landscapes which were prized all over Europe. His interest was the countryside. Without any religious theme as pretext, he painted two pure landscapes whose true subjects are the forest and the river, motivated by the themes of hunting and fishing. Therefore Carracci was able to show nature animated with the life of the aristocracy and of ordinary people. The composition follows the visual device of division into compartments.H. Loyrette, ibid., Ch.I, Italian School. Fishing Scene by Annibale Carracci (before 1595),1.36 m x 2.53m Along with the Galleria Farnese, these two thematic paintings are among Carracci's masterpieces, and have always been much admired by artists.

The facts Lac Gobeil Water Aerodrome has been conducting a business of air excursions on Lac Gobeil in the municipality of Sacr√©‚ÄëCoeur since 2005. It was licensed under the Aeronautics Act to conduct such a business, and registered its aerodrome pursuant to the Canadian Aviation Regulations. Until 1995, the municipality's zoning by-law did not allow for water aerodromes or aeronautics in general to be conducted on Lac Gobeil. The by-law was amended to allow such activity for part of the lake, but not the part in which the aerodrome in question was operating. The municipality applied for an injunction ordering the company to cease its aviation activities on Lac Gobeil on the ground that operation of the aerodrome and the associated business in that zone violated the by‚Äëlaw. The courts below The Superior Court of Quebec found that the legislation at issue was a valid municipal zoning by‚Äëlaw, with only incidental effects on the federal subject of aeronautics. The Quebec Court of Appeal set aside that decision, concluding that the by‚Äëlaw, though valid, could not apply to the aerodrome because of the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. Judgment of the Supreme Court The appeal was dismissed. The evidence revealed that the real object of the by‚Äëlaw was not related to zoning and did not fall under any provincial head of power. Rather, its essence was to regulate the location of water aerodromes in the municipality, a matter within the exclusive federal jurisdiction over aeronautics. Since the by‚Äëlaw was, in pith and substance, about the regulation of aeronautics, it fell outside provincial jurisdiction. The by‚Äëlaw was not saved by the ancillary powers doctrine. Under that doctrine, a provision which is, in pith and substance, outside the competence of its enacting body will be saved where it is an important part of a broader legislative scheme that is within the competence of the enacting body. * The degree of integration required increases in proportion to the seriousness of the encroachment. * Where the impugned measure encroaches only slightly on the jurisdiction of the other level of government, a rational, functional connection is required. * As the degree of intrusion grows more serious, the required degree of integration tends toward a test of necessity. * The by‚Äëlaw did not constitute a serious intrusion on federal jurisdiction and the rational functional test was applicable. To meet the test, a prima facie invalid measure must complement rather than merely supplement the legislative scheme. It must, both rationally and in its function, further the purposes of the valid legislative scheme of which it is said to be part. The amendment was passed to protect the use of Lac Gobeil and similar areas by vacationers. However, it did not confine its ban on aerodromes to vacation areas. Rather, it banned aerodromes throughout the municipality, which spans a variety of land uses. It did not function as zoning legislation, but rather, as a stand‚Äëalone prohibition. It treated similar parcels differently, and different parcels the same, belying the first principle of zoning legislation. In any event, if the zoning by‚Äëlaw did have the effect of prohibiting water aerodromes, it would be inapplicable to the extent it did so, under the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. A prohibition on aerodromes, even as part of a broad class of land uses, would result in an unacceptable narrowing of Parliament‚Äôs legislative options. This would have the effect of impairing the core of the federal power over aeronautics. Impact This case, together with the concurrent case of Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, has further added to the Court's jurisprudence on Canadian federalism in a significant manner. There has been discussion as to the consistency of these rulings in comparison to previous jurisprudence.

The Workbench, designed for personal computers running MS Windows, is distributed commercially in three packages: GWB Professional, Standard, and Essentials, as well as in the free GWB Student Edition. GWB reads datasets of thermodynamic equilibrium constants (most commonly compiled from 0 to 300 ¬∞C along the steam saturation curve) with which it can calculate chemical equilibria. Thermodynamic datasets from other popular programs like PHREEQC,Parkhurst, D.L., 1995, User's Guide to PHREEQC, a computer model for speciation, reaction-path, advective-transport and inverse geochemical calculations.

Bastrakov, 2005, K2GWB: Utility for generating thermodynamic data files for The Geochemist's Workbench¬Æ at 0‚Äì1000 ¬∞C and 1‚Äì5000 bar from UT2K and the UNITHERM database. Computers & Geosciences 31, 756-767 (log K to GWB) was written to generate thermodynamic data for GWB under pressures and temperatures beyond the limits of the default datasets. The GWB can couple chemical reaction with hydrologic transport to produce simulations known as reactive transport models. GWB can calculate flow fields dynamically, or import flow fields as numeric data or calculated directly from the USGS hydrologic flow code MODFLOW.  Uses in science and industry  Geochemists working in the field, office, lab, or classroom store their analyses, calculate the distribution of chemical mass, create plots and diagrams, evaluate their experiments, and solve real-world problems. The software is used by environmental chemists, engineers, microbiologists, and remediators to gain quantitative understanding of the chemical and microbiological reactions which control the fate and mobility of contaminants in the biosphere. With this knowledge, they can develop predictive models of contaminant fate and transport, and test the effectiveness of costly remediation schemes before implementing them in the field. Within the energy industry, petroleum engineers, mining geologists, environmental geochemists and geothermal energy developers use the software to search for resources, optimize recovery, and manage wastes, all while using safe and environmentally friendly practices. Geoscientists manage the side effects of energy production in carbon sequestration projects and in the design of nuclear waste repositories.  Uses in education  Hundreds of scholarly articles cite or use GWB and several textbooks apply the software to solve common problems in environmental protection and remediation, the petroleum industry, and economic geology.Bethke, C.M., 1996, Geochemical Reaction Modeling, Concepts and Applications. Oxford University Press, 397 pp.Bethke, C.M., 2008, Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp. Geochemistry students can save time performing routine but tedious tasks that are easily accomplished with the software. Instead of balancing chemical reactions and constructing Eh-pH diagrams by hand, for example, students can spend time exploring advanced topics like multi-component equilibrium, kinetic theory, or reactive transport. Students can apply for a free download of The Geochemist's Workbench Student Edition from the developer's website.

Pryor was the middle son of Lt. Col. Walter Marlborough Pryor and his wife Ethne Philippa (n√©e Moore), the daughter of Sir Norman Moore, 1st Baronet. His paternal grandfather was Marlborough Robert Pryor, who was an amateur naturalist \\"well known in Cambridge scientific circles\\". He was educated, per family tradition, at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He worked as a research student under A.D. Imms. Pryor married Sophie Raverat,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art- obituaries/8705200/Sophie-Gurney.html daughter of the late French artist Jacques Raverat and his wife Gwendolen Mary (n√©e Darwin) (a granddaughter of Charles Darwin), in 1940. They had four children: Emily Pryor (1942‚Äì2008), William Marlborough Pryor (born 1945), Lucy (known professionally as \\"Lucy Raverat\\", born 1948) and Amy Eleanor (born 1952, known as Nelly; she married her 3rd cousin, the film and television director Philip Trevelyan). Pryor was elected a Fellow of Trinity College in 1939. Before the war, he published with P.F. Holmes a paper on barnacles in Horsey Mere in Nature. He also published a double paper on the hardening of oothecae and cuticles in insects. During the Second World War, Pryor worked at the Timber and Adhesives Division of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, RAE Farnborough, where he applied his entomological knowledge to the development of aircraft glue, alongside Norman de Bruyne. After the war, de Bruyne continued commercial production of glues, but Pryor returned to Cambridge, where he continued his research. He collaborated on papers with, amongst others, John Tileston Edsall, Laurence Picken and Michael Swann and A.R. Todd, although for the slight majority of his papers he was the only author. Pryor became a tutor at Trinity in 1955, and was later senior tutor until 1964. In 1967 Mark and Sophie Pryor were involved in a road traffic accident, in which she was relatively unharmed but which left him with brain damage in a persistent vegetative state for almost three years until his death, aged 51.

Life and career A graduate of Miss Porter's Schoolhttp://www.porters.org/ftpimages/301/misc/misc_67719.pdf in Farmington, Connecticut, Gutcheon went on to study at Harvard University, earning a bachelor of arts with honors in English. In 1973, Gutcheon published her first book, The Perfect Patchwork Primer; two years later came its sequel, The Quilt Design Workbook,https://www.amazon.com/Quilt-Design-Workbook-Beth- Gutcheon/dp/0892560371 written with then-husband, Jeffrey Gutcheon. Both works are considered classics in their field. In 1978, Gutcheon wrote the narration for a feature-length documentary about the Kirov ballet school in St. Petersburg, Russia, called The Children of Theatre Street, which was nominated for an Academy Award. Other screenplays include The Good Fight (1992), starring Terry O‚ÄôQuinn and Christine Lahti, for Lifetime. Gutcheon's first novel, The New Girls, was published in 1979. The novel drew loosely upon the author's own experience of the cruel and rarified atmosphere of elite boarding schools, and was well received by critics.https://www.harpercollins.com/web- sampler/9780060977023 Her second novel, Still Missing, was translated into 14 languages, and published in a condensed version by Reader's Digest, a large print edition for the vision-impaired, and made into an audio book. Gutcheon used her appearances promoting the novel, whose plot centered on a child abduction, to elevate the subject of missing children to the level of a national issue, raising public awareness and support for Child Find of America.http://www.childfindofamerica.org/ The appearance of Missing Child photos on milk cartons was a direct result of this campaign, as was the creation of National Missing Children's Day. Still Missing was bought for the screen by movie producer Stanley R. Jaffe, who had recently won the Best Picture Oscar for Kramer vs. Kramer. Gutcheon was retained to write the screenplay. The finished film, titled Without A Trace, was released by Twentieth Century Fox in February 1983, starring Kate Nelligan, Judd Hirsch, and Stockard Channing. Because of the similar timing of Still Missing and Without A Trace, some suggested a strained relationship between Gutcheon and the parents of famously missing child Etan Patz. The controversy was corrected in a 1982 letter to the Editor at The New York Times where Stanley K. Patz, Etan's father, said \\"We repeatedly stated that we had no quarrel with Beth Gutcheon and that we liked her.\\" In spring 2010, Still Missing, was re- published in the UK by Persephone Books, a London-based publisher committed to reprinting \\"neglected classics by 20th Century (mostly women) writers.\\"http://www.persephonebooks.co.uk/still-missing.html Gutcheon's other novels include bestsellers Domestic Pleasures (1991)Harper Collins2 published in British, French, German and Swedish editions, Saying Grace (1995),Harper Collins3 Five Fortunes (1998), and More Than You Know (2000) which are all available in German, as well. More Than You Know went on to become a Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year.https://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/03/books/bk-60523/18 Leeway Cottage (2005) became a national bestseller the same year that HarperCollins republished Gutcheon's entire backlist in uniform trade paperback editions. Since then, her entire fiction backlist has been continuously in print. Her 2008 novel Good-bye and Amen was published in hardcover and HarperPerennial trade paper back editions; the audio version was a finalist for an Audie Award for Best Recorded Novel of the Year, 2010.

He continued serving in the army until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Between the two wars, he was made lieutenant in the r√©giment Royal- Carabiniers, then in 1756 - at the start of the Seven Years' War - he was a captain in the r√©giment de cavalerie de Lameth. He received 15 sabre cuts at the battle of Rossbach, including ten to the head, giving rise to the scar or 'balafre' which gave him his nickname. Carried off the battlefield, he won the cross of the order of saint Louis, still aged only 25 (ribbons were much less numerous under the Ancien R√©gime and reserved for older officers with at least 25 years' service as an officer). In 1767, the king made him a captain in the r√©giment Royal-Carabiniers and then capitaine-major.

Flavocoxid has been approved for use as a medical food in the United States since 2004 and is available by prescription for use in chronic osteoarthritis in tablets of 500 mg under the commercial name Limbrel. Flavocoxid has been linked to occasional minor elevations in serum enzyme levels during therapy and to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury.  Hepatotoxicity  In clinical trials, serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in up to 10% of patients on flavocoxid therapy, but elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in only 1% to 2% of recipients. However, there have been several reports of clinically apparent acute liver injury attributed to flavocoxid. Most cases have occurred in women (who are more likely to take flavocoxid). The time to onset has been 1 to 5 months and the pattern of enzyme elevations was usually hepatocellular or mixed. Most cases have been moderate in severity and no instance of acute liver failure or death has been reported. Complete resolution upon stopping flavocoxid has occurred in 2 to 12 weeks. Immunoallergic features have been mild and autoantibodies are not common. At least one instance of recurrence upon rechallenge has been reported.  Mechanism of Injury  Flavocoxid is a proprietary mixture of molecules extracted from plants and it is unclear which component(s) might be responsible for liver injury. The mixture includes extracts from Scutellaria baicalensis (containing the phytochemical baicalin) and Acacia catechu (catechin)), both of which have been implicated in causing idiosyncratic acute liver injury, but the mechanism is unknown.  Outcome and management  No instances of acute liver failure or chronic liver injury have been linked to flavocoxid use and all cases have been self-limited, without subsequent chronic hepatitis or vanishing bile duct syndrome. Recurrence upon re-exposure has been reported and rechallenge should be avoided. There is no information on possible cross sensitivity of hepatic injury with other medications or herbal agents such as skull cap or green tea.

He was a mentor to Jody Samson and made knives for over 60 years. History Cooper began making utility knives and butcher knives in Tremont, Pennsylvania in 1924 while working as a welder. Eventually he moved on to welding in the Virginia shipyards and began making hunting knives, fishing knives and combat knives as a second business. Cooper's knives were made by the stock removal method and he attached his handles using traditional methods such as rivets and pins until 1965 when he retired from welding and relocated to Burbank, California as a full-time knifemaker with his nephew, Greorge Cooper as Cooper Knives. As a full-time knifemaker, he noticed that his traditional methods of knife making could leave gaps between blade, guard, and handle material where water or blood could collect and eventually corrode the knife. He developed a new method of construction which made the knife and handle into a solid, bonded unit by welding, brazing, and using epoxy. He patented these ideas in 1967 (3481038) and 1971 (3595104). A prolific maker who made over 100 knives in a month, Cooper taught his trade to knifemakers, Jody Samson and Vic Anselmo in 1969. He was a charter member of the Knifemakers' Guild. Cooper made push daggers for police officers and FBI agents. Celebrities such as John Wayne, Sammy Davis Jr. and Lee Marvin collected Cooper's knives. Cooper made knives used in film and television such as the Arkansas toothpick in The Sacketts and a Bowie knife for Jeremiah Johnson. In 1978, Cooper opened a new knife shop in Lufkin, Texas where he made 1,000 knives per year until his retirement from knifemaking in 1981. In retirement he made a few knives every year until his death in 1987.

In 1157, Chesney acquired the honour of Blythburgh, and was sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk during the 1150s and 1160s. On Chesney's death in 1174, he left three unmarried daughters as his heirs. Early life Chesney was the son of Robert fitz Walter and Sybil de Chesney, and a younger brother of John de Chesney.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 370 Sybil was the daughter of Ralph de Chesney.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 369 Robert fitz Walter was lord of Horsford in Norfolk, which was originally held by Walter de Caen, Robert's father.

William then inherited the lands. John and William had a sister called Margaret, who was the wife of Haimo de St Clair. Their father married a second time, and had a son named Simon by that marriage. William took his surname from his mother's family, as did his half- brother Simon, who was not related to the Chesney family except by marriage.Brown \\"Introduction\\" Sibton Abbey Cartularies p. 13 Two further children of Robert's, Elias and Peter, are known, but whether they were the children of the first marriage or the second is unclear. Chesney should be distinguished from another William de Chesney, who controlled the town of Oxford and its castle as well as the town of Deddington and its castle in the same time period.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 205 Career Chesney founded Sibton Abbey, and after his brother John's death he confirmed the foundation of that Cistercian monastery,Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants pp. 363‚Äì364 which was the only Cistercian house in Suffolk.Brown \\"Introduction\\" Sibton Abbey Cartularies p. 1 Besides founding that monastery, he also gave lands or other gifts to Colne Priory, Essex, Thetford Priory, Castle Acre Priory, St John's Abbey, Stoke-by-Clare Priory, and Blythburgh Priory.Brown \\"Introduction\\" Sibton Abbey Cartularies p. 16‚Äì17 Chesney acquired the barony of Blythburgh in Suffolk in 1157. These lands were recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being held by the king, and when Chesney was granted them they were assessed at one knight's fee in feudal service.Sanders English Baronies p. 16 Besides Blythburgh, Chesney also acquired lands in Norfolk and Essex which he added to the family lands in Norfolk and Suffolk. In 1153 or 1154, Chesney was the recipient of the lordship of a hundred and a half in Norfolk, possibly in compensation for the loss of the manor of Mileham. Chesney likely lost Mileham to another noble family, the fitzAlans, as part of the settlement resulting from the Treaty of Wallingford which settled the civil war in England.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 276 footnote 76 Both William's father Robert and his elder brother John had held these offices before him.Brown \\"Introduction\\" Sibton Abbey Cartularies pp. 11‚Äì12 Chesney was Sheriff of Norfolk in the late 1140s and the 1150s, being recorded as holding that office in two documents ‚Äì one dated to between 1146 and 1149 and the other dated to between 1146 and 1153.Green English Sheriffs p. 62 The same documents record him as holding the office of Sheriff of Suffolk at concurrent times.Green English Sheriffs p. 77 He held both offices again between 1156 and 1163. Death and legacy Chesney died in 1174, having had three daughters with his wife Gilla. Her ancestry is unknown, and it is possible that William married another time, to Aubrey de Poynings, because a Lewes Priory charter dated to around 1165 names a William de Chesney and Aubrey his wife, but it is not clear whether this charter is referring to William de Chesney the sheriff or to another William.

The device features a 1.5 GHz dual core processor, 1 GB RAM, 32 GB internal storage, a micro-USB connector that also supports USB On-The-Go and a micro HDMI port for viewing pictures and videos from the device on a TV screen. It is also equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled which can be used with Xperia SmartTags, or for low value financial transactions, as NFC becomes more widespread in use, with the appropriate applications from Google Play. The Xperia S also come with a special nano coating that is not just dirt repellent but also UV Active. It is also report that the Xperia S come with a fast charging ability. Charge times will be reduced by half and a 10-minute charge is good enough to keep the phone going for an hour. Software The Xperia S was released with Android 2.3 (\\"Gingerbread\\"), but received an update to Android 4.0.4 (\\"Ice Cream Sandwich\\") on 21 June in some countries or carriers. Sony has announced an update to Android Jelly Bean 4.1 for the Xperia S from the end of May 2013. The update to Android 4.1.2 Jelly Bean began to roll out on 30 May 2013. The update brought new features, such as improved entertainment and camera apps, improved battery life, improved app organisation and new personalisation options. The Xperia S is Facebook integrated and features the Timescape UI. It is also PlayStation Certified which allows users to play PlayStation Suite games, and is connected to the Sony Entertainment Network, allowing users to access Music & Video Unlimited. The Xperia S is also DLNA certified. You can make your device run on KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat by using custom roms Design The front of the Xperia S is almost 90% glass which appears all black when the screen is off and the back is curved slightly for comfort. The antenna is embedded in the transparent strip which cuts through the base of the device, the strip illuminates and indicates where the back, home, and menu buttons are placed. Unlike the competing Samsung Galaxy S3, the Xperia S is equipped with a dedicated physical camera shutter button which can also be used to quick- launch the camera. The buttons themselves are implemented as touch-sensitive regions between the transparent strip and the screen, like on the Sony Xperia P. Under the transparent belt, there is an XPERIA inscribed on top. This design approach is what Sony described as ‚ÄúIconic Identity‚Äù, which is a simple and strong look that's easily recognizable as a Sony Xperia. Reception At launch, the Xperia S was praised for its hardware, its distinctive design, high-definition display, efficient camera and voice clarity but was criticized for its lack of removable storage and battery. Among Android smartphones, it competed with the Galaxy Nexus, HTC One X, LG Optimus 4X HD, and Samsung Galaxy S III. The 2012 June update to the newest Android version, 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich), was well received and added its own improvements. Despite the Xperia S and the iPhone 4S sharing similar Exmor R camera sensors, Natasha Lomas of CNET UK preferred the iPhone 4S camera for its colours, exposure, focus and noise reduction, (some comments on Natasha's article criticised that the test was biased and unfair whilst others felt that the conclusion was justified), but for Basil Kronfli of recombu, the Xperia S was nearly tied with the HTC One X for the best camera, for its physical button and detailed picture quality, ahead of the Nokia N8, itself above the iPhone 4S.

By 1880, her husband and father had been relieved of their jobs with the Canadian Pacific Railway after encountering difficulties with construction around Cross Lake, and Charlotte's father enabled Ross to take over a lumber mill in the area. Ross moved the lumber mill to the Whitemouth River to the location that is now Whitemouth, Manitoba, before sending for his wife and children in 1881.Hacker, Carlotta (1974).

As the only doctor within a 100-mile radius, Charlotte was responsible for a great many people, and would often go above and beyond the call of duty in treating her patients. To get to them, Charlotte would often have to travel great distances without roads, using canoes, ox-teams, horses or sleighs to reach her destinations.Hacker, Carlotta (1974). The Indomitable Lady Doctors. Toronto: Clarke, Irwin and Company Limited. p. 84.

Medical License and Registration  In 1887, despite having practiced medicine for years without a license, Charlotte applied to the Manitoba Legislature for registration as a physician, and upon her refusal she instructed a Winnipeg legal firm to file an application for a private act that would authorize her to practice medicine.Kinnear, Mary (1995). In Subordination: Professional Women, 1879-1970. Montreal: McGill- Queen‚Äôs University Press. p. 55 The license itself was somewhat contentious, as there had been a recent border dispute between Manitoba and Ontario, with Whitemouth being near the border.Hacker, Carlotta (1974). The Indomitable Lady Doctors. Toronto: Clarke, Irwin and Company Limited. p. 86. The act was brought forward in the Legislative Assembly by way of a Private Members Bill in 1888, and was opposed by William Fisher Luxton, arguing on the grounds that women doctors should only treat women and children, that Charlotte ought to be grouped with midwives in terms of her profession and that the matter ought to ultimately be decided by the College of Physicians and Surgeons.Vera K.

They are best known for their Spanish language covers of songs from the 1960s and the 1970s.WhoSampled: Los Mustang Career The young musicians met at San Carlos Club. Three of them (Marco Rossi, Miguel Navarro and Antonio Mercad√©) were members of the group Poble-sec. Los Mustang were inspired by the style of The Shadows. With the inclusion of Santi Carulla (from rival group Los S√≠rex) as lead singer, the group gained fame in Barcelona with an image of professionalism and cover interpretation of international hits. In October 1962, Los Mustang recorded their debut album on EMI-Odeon, featuring cover versions of popular songs like \\"Quinientas Millas\\", Peter, Paul and Mary's \\"500 Miles\\", Johnny Hallyday's \\"Madison Twist\\", and Spanish songs \\"He de saber\\" and \\"No lo ves\\". Their repertoire consisted of many Spanish-interpreted foreign hits, but also included several original Spanish songs. In 1963 they released four EPs, featuring the sound effects instrumental Telstar from The Tornados. They also released successful versions of French hits like \\"Capri se acab√≥\\" (Herv√© Vilard's \\"Capri c'est fini\\"), \\"Mi Vida\\" (cover of Alain Barri√®re hit \\"Ma vie\\"), \\"El Mundo\\" (based on Jimmy Fontana hit \\"Il mondo\\") and many songs from The Beatles. 1964 followed with versions from The Beatles' \\"Please Please Me\\", \\"Conocerte Mejor\\", \\"Nadie Respondi√≥\\", and \\"Un Billete Compro\\". However, their best-known song is a version of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" entitled \\"Submarino Amarillo\\" that sold more than 130,000 copies just in Spain. In 1966, they took the trophy for best band at a music festival. In the 1970s Los Mustang continued to record covers. They released the critically acclaimed Reino Prohibido Del Himalaya (meaning Himalayan Forbidden Kingdom) in 2 parts, in line with the psychedelic trend. It consisted of conceptual songs about earlier advanced civilizations, based on the theories of Hanns H√∂rbiger and Michel Peissel. They also toured in Cuba, but by 1973 their contract with EMI had expired and their output declined. During the 1980s, they experienced a revival with the recording of a new album which once again included versions of oldies and had various performances with arch-rivals Los S√≠rex. In 2000, they released a special album to celebrate 40 years of the band, collaborating with artists Luis Eduardo Aute, Dyango, El D√∫o Din√°mico, Cliff Richard and Jimmy Fontana.

The species was listed in the Top 10 New Species 2013 by the International Institute for Species Exploration for discoveries made during 2012. Discovery The frog species was discovered in August 2009 by Louisiana State University herpetologist Christopher Austin and his PhD student Eric Rittmeyer while on an expedition to explore the biodiversity of Papua New Guinea. The new species was found near Amau village in the Central Province, from which its specific name is derived. The discovery was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PLOS One in January 2012. Because the frogs have calls that resemble those made by insects and are camouflaged among leaves on the forest floor, Paedophryne amauensis were difficult to detect. While recording nocturnal frog calls in the forest, Austin and Rittmeyer used triangulation to identify the source of an unknown animal and discovered the frogs by scooping up handfuls of leaf litter and putting it into plastic bags where they spotted the tiny frog hopping around.

The frog lives on land and its life cycle does not include a tadpole stage. Instead, members of this species hatch as 'hoppers': miniatures of the adults. The skeleton is reduced and there are only seven presacral vertebrae present. They are capable of jumping thirty times their body length. The frog is crepuscular and feeds on small invertebrates. Males call for mates with a series of very high-pitched insect- like peeps at a frequency of 8400‚Äì9400 Hz. Habitat Due to having a high surface to volume ratio, the Paedophryne amauensis are subject to water-loss and dependent on the high-moisture content of leaf litter. Similar to all species of Paedophryne known so far, members of Paedophryne amauensis live in the leaf litter on the floors of tropical forests.

Retrieved: July 4, 2019. American silent romantic drama produced and distributed by Warner Bros. Influenced by the \\"Lindy craze\\", generated by Charles Lindbergh's famous ocean crossing flight, Across the Atlantic was rushed into production. Plot Two brothers, Hugh (Monte Blue) and Dan Clayton (Robert Ober), love their father's secretary, Phyllis Jones (Edna Murphy). She chooses Hugh, and they marry before he goes to war as a pilot. Shot down in France, he loses his memory and becomes a drifter. Eight years later, Phyllis, resigned to her fate, promises to marry Dan after a visit to the place in France where Hugh was last seen. Meanwhile, Hugh, back in America, is working for his father (Burr McIntosh) at the Clayton aircraft company. While he is test-flying an aircraft, his memory returns. He crashes and is taken to an asylum because of his insistence that he is John Clayton's son. Hugh escapes the asylum, steals an experimental trans-Atlantic aircraft, and flies it to Paris to be reunited with his family. Cast * Monte Blue as Hugh Clayton * Edna Murphy as Phyllis Jones * Burr McIntosh as John Clayton * Robert Ober as Dan Clayton * Irene Rich as unknown role Production Aviation historian Michael Paris in From the Wright Brothers to Top Gun: Aviation, Nationalism, and Popular Cinema (1995) described the frenzy of trying to woo Lindbergh to do a film. Hollywood resorted to a spate of aviation-related features including Publicity Madness (1927), Flying Romeos (1928) and A Hero for a Night, even the Walt Disney Studios' Plane Crazy (1928), all comedy spoofs of the Lindbergh transatlantic flight.Paris 1995, p. 58.

One of the measures for safeguarding this right is the use of informed consent for clinical researches. Researchers refer to populations which have low autonomy as \\"vulnerable populations\\"; these are groups which may not be able to fairly decide for themselves whether to participate in clinical trials. Examples of groups which are vulnerable populations include incarcerated persons, children, prisoners, soldiers, people under detention, migrants, persons exhibiting insanity or any other condition which precludes their autonomy, and to a lesser extent, any population for which there is reason to believe that the research study could seem particularly or unfairly persuasive or misleading.

She is also a member of the Family Inequality Network, HCEO,U of Chicago and a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of LaborInstitut zur Zukunft der Arbeit(IZA)(Accessed July 2019) and the CESifo Institute. She is a well- published scholar as well as a founder of two organizations related to household economics: a journal, the Review of Economics of the Household founded in 2001 (she remains its editor in chief) and the Society of Economics of the Household.Grossbard-Shechtman, Shoshana (2003) From the Editor's Desk: REHO and the New Home Economics, Review of Economics of the Household Volume: 1,Issue: 1 p5-7 The Society (SEHO) holds annual meetings since 2017. The main focus of Grossbard's research is household economics, family economics and economics of marriage. A student of Gary Becker and James Heckman at the University of Chicago and of Jacob Mincer, she was one of the first economists to enter this research area. In her theoretical approach she views marriages and cohabitating couples as firms, with spouses possibly hiring each other's work in household production, which she calls \\"Work-In-Household (WiHo)\\". To the extent that husbands employ their wives' WiHo and pay them a low \\"quasi- wage\\" women can be considered as being exploited by their husbands, as claimed by Marxist-feminist economists. As are workers and firms in standard models of labor markets in her models spouses are interacting in a non-cooperative way. Legal ownership of the household is a question related to the analysis of marriages as firms. Robert Ellickson has argued that owners of the household's capital should have more influence on decision-making related to the household than those who work in the household's production. In contrast, Grossbard has proposed that those doing the household's production should have more control over decisions than owners of the household's capital. Grossbard is one of the first social scientists to have analyzed consequences of gender imbalance in sex ratio for intra-household distribution, labor supply, fertility and cohabitation.David M.

It received a Michael L. Printz Honor and a feature film starring Hailee Steinfeld was in the works, and was meant to be released in early 2014. Plot summary Min Green and Ed Slaterton, a high school junior and senior basketball jock, respectively, ended their relationship, which lasted from October 5 to November 12. The story takes the form of a letter, with Min writing to Ed explaining why they had broken up. The letter accompanies a box full of minor objects that narrates the progress of their relationship, and is returned to Ed at the end of the letter. The box includes two bottle caps, a movie ticket, a lobby ticket, a box of matches, a pinhole camera, a folded note, a rubber band, a high school pennant, a toy truck, a recipe book (Real Recipes from Tinseltown), Pensieri, a fictional liquor (and Italian for \\"thoughts\\"), a protractor, a file, a concert ticket, an egg cuber (\\"makes a square egg\\"), a polaroid, a comb from a motel room, a pair of ugly earrings, and several other items collected over the course of their relationship.

Handler interviewed people at Grand Central Station in New York City about their experiences with break-ups. Reception Monica Edinger, a fourth-grade teacher at The Dalton School, praises the book, a \\"silken, bittersweet tale of adolescent heartache\\", in the New York Times, noting his \\"remarkable presentation of an adolescent girl's point of view\\".

Biography He was born in New York City. He was the son of a decorative painter, with whom he served a three years' apprenticeship. He then studied painting in New York with E. M. Ward and Will Hicok Low, and in Munich with Feodor Dietz and Frank Duveneck. His meager resources obligated him to return from Munich back home to New York in 1883, where he again devoted himself to decorative painting. The year of his return, he submitted A Girl in a Snow-Storm to the National Academy of Design's annual exhibition. The following year he submitted Puzzled, and was awarded the First Hallgarten Prize.

In a career that lasted from 1977 to 1979 he ran twenty times and won seven races. Ahonoora was a sprinter who specialised in races over five and six furlongs, with his most important wins coming in the Stewards's Cup at Goodwood and the Group Two William Hill Sprint Championship (now a Group One race) at York. He is primarily notable for his achievements at stud, where his progeny, including Dr Devious, Park Express and Indian Ridge, made him one of the most significant modern representatives of the Byerley Turk sire line. Background The entrance to Wyld Court Stud, where Ahonoora was foaled. Ahonoora was bred in England by the Wyld Court Stud near the village of Hampstead Norreys in Berkshire and sold as a yearling for 7,600 guineas to Essa Alkhalifa. His sire, Lorenzaccio was a high-class racehorse who won the July Stakes and the Prix Jean Prat in his early career, but was principally famous for his defeat of the Triple Crown winner Nijinsky as a five-year-old in the 1970 Champion Stakes. Racing career Ahonoora was sent into training with Brian Swift at Loretta Lodge, Epsom. As a three-year-old, Ahonoora recorded his first major win when he took the Strewards' Cup as a 50/1 outsider. As a four-year-old, Ahonoora moved to the Fitzroy stable of Frankie Durr at Newmarket, Suffolk and made a successful transition from handicaps to Conditions races. In spring he finished second to Double Form in the Temple Stakes at Sandown and in June he was second again to the same horse in the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot. He returned to Goodwood to win the Group Three King George Stakes in July. In August he recorded his most important success when he was awarded the William Hill Sprint Championship at York on the disqualification of Thatching. In September he finished second to Double Form for the third time in the Vernons Sprint Cup at Haydock. Stud career Ahonoora was retired to the Irish National Stud in 1980 at a fee of ¬£2,250. He soon exceeded all expectations, and, despite his racing career as a pure sprinter, he proved capable of siring top class performers at a wide range of distances. Ahonoora proved to be one of the most successful and important representatives of the Byerley Turk line in the modern era. His notable winners include: *Park Appeal (1982)- Cheveley Park Stakes *Park Express (1983)- Irish Champion Stakes *Don't Forget Me (1984)- 2000 Guineas *Indian Ridge (1985)- King's Stand Stakes, leading sire of Compton Place, Domedriver, Indian Haven, Namid, Sleeping Indian, Linngari, Ridgewood Pearl and Indian Ink *Ruby Tiger (1987)- E. P. Taylor Stakes * Dr Devious (1989)- Epsom Derby, sire of Collier Hill and Kinnaird. *Inchinor (1990)- sire of Notnowcato and Orientor He is the damsire of: * New Approach (2005)- Epsom Derby, sire of Dawn Approach * Cape Cross (1994)- sire of Sea The Stars, Ouija Board, Golden Horn and Awtaad. * Azeri (1998)- Breeders' Cup Distaff * Leroidesanimaux (2000)- sire of Animal Kingdom * Acclamation (1999) - sire of Dark Angel, Equiano, Marsha and Harbour Watch In 1989, Ahonoora was bought by the Coolmore Stud. He was shuttled to stand in Australia for the southern hemisphere breeding season. He died after sustaining a broken hind leg in a paddock accident at Segenhoe Stud in the upper Hunter Region, Australia in September 1989.

The Asferg Runestone, listed as DR 121 in the Rundata catalog, is a Viking Age memorial runestone found at Asferg, which is about northeast of Randers, Aarhus County, Region Midtjylland, Denmark. Description The inscription on DR 121, which is about in height and made of granite, consists of runic text in the younger futhark within a band that loops to form three rows of text. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style RAK, which is the classification for the oldest style where the text bands have straight ends without any attached beast or serpent heads. The runestone was discovered in 1795 at a barrow in Asferg, but was still reused as a paving stone near a local mill. Before the historic significance of runestones was understood, they were often reused as materials in the construction of churches, bridges, and roads. The stone was purchased by the Danish Antiquities Commission in 1810 and shipped to Copenhagen in 1825. Today it is displayed at the National Museum of Denmark. The runic text, which is read boustrophedonically from the lower left, states that the stone was raised by a man named √ûorgeirr in memory of his brother M√∫li. The text describes the deceased man M√∫li as being \\"a very good thegn\\" or \\"√æegn\\". The term thegn was used in the late Viking Age in Sweden and Denmark to describe a class of retainer.

History In the final years of the rule of Francisco Franco, there was uncertainty as to the path the country would follow after the caudillo's demise. Many members of the officer corps willingly accepted the prospect of a transition to a new constitutional order, but others, mainly in the army, who still identified with Francoist Spain, regarded democratisation as a betrayal of the nationalist victory in the civil war that ended in 1939.Spain: The Military in Political Life, Country Studies Series of the Federal Research Division of the Library of CongressCampuzano, Francisco. L'√©lite franquiste et la sortie de la dictature (\\"The Francoist elite and the exit from the dictatorship\\"), L'Harmattan, Paris, 1997, (in French) In 1972, a small, secret society of younger army officers was formed around a platform of common objectives: Unifying the three armed-forces ministries; restricting the scope of the military justice system; reducing the length of military service for the population which was, at the time, obligatory; the imposition of restrictions on the military intelligence system; restricting the authority of the captains general of the nine military regions of the country; etc. The group grew relatively quickly, its members numbering between two and three hundred military officers by 1974. Events in Portugal, where, in 25 April 1974, the military forces staged a coup that effectively returned democracy to the country, boosted participation in the secret organisation of Spanish military officers, which adopted the name Uni√≥n Militar Democr√°tica (Democratic Military Union). Reaction of Francoist Spain The existence of the organisation quickly became known to the SECED, the intelligence service of the Spanish state, and nine of its members were arrested in Madrid in July 1975, put on trial and condemned in 1976 to prison sentences of up to eight years. One of the arrested was founding member Major Luis Otero who got the heaviest sentence but was pardoned under the 1977 Amnesty Law. Notably, one of the arrested members of UMD had been born inside the citadel of Alc√°zar during its protracted siege by Republican forces, in the Spanish Civil War. In a 2010 interview to Spanish newspaper El Pa√≠s, one of the founding members said that he and his fellow officers had contacted \\"as many people as possible\\" within the military in order to spread their ideas, concluding \\"We obviously talked to the wrong people because the intelligence services found out about us immediately.\\" Dissolution The organisation declared itself dissolved in June 1977, on the occasion of the first free, democratic elections to be held in Spain since 1935. Legacy Most of the reforms outlined in the political platform of UDM were eventually, though gradually, adopted after Franco's death by the democratic governments. In 2008, Spanish judge Baltasar Garz√≥n opened a far-reaching investigation into the disappearances of Republicans under Francoist Spain, also ordering the opening of alleged mass graves (including one believed to contain the remains of the poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca).\\"Spain: Investigation launched into Franco‚Äôs crimes\\", World Socialist Web Site, 3 November 2008 The investigation caused political turmoil, with people opposed to it claiming that the 1977 amnesty covered all the crimes committed by either side during the Civil War. One of the founding members of UDM, retired colonel Juli√°n Delgado, who, after the transition to democracy, was appointed head of the Guardia Urbana (the city police force) in Barcelona, publicly objected to the investigation, because it would be \\"absurd to stir up pain.\\" Delgado warned that support for the victims of the Civil War and their families should be done \\"without the desire for revenge\\" since this \\"does no good to democracy.\\"\\"Digging up past atrocities\\" , InterPress Service, 9 October 2008 In 2010, Defence Minister Carme Chac√≥n, representing the Spanish government, awarded the Military Merit Cross to 14 members of UMD, three of them posthumously.\\"Former military rebels receive recognition\\", The News, 17 February 2010 See also *Movimento das For√ßas Armadas References Bibliography *Fern√°ndez L√≥pez, Javier.

This medieval order apparently originated in Spain from the Order of Calatrava; another theory reports that it originated in Portugal in the twelfth century under King Afonso Henriques. The chancellery that took care of the records of the Brazilian order belonged to the Ministry of the Empire. Its religious character was deprived by means of Decree of 9 September 1843. It was maintained after the proclamation of the Republic, together with the Imperial Order of the Southern Cross, by determination of Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, by decree no. 227F of 22 of March 1890. Until its definitive extinction, by means of Constitution of 1891, arrived from the Fonseca to distribute the orders of Avis and the Cruise to 724 people. By decree no. 4238 of 15 November 1901, an honorary medal was created that bears his name, reserved to decorate Brazilian soldiers of the three arms. Also, the Order of Military Merit, created by Decree No. 24660 of June 11, 1934, presents the cross flowering in reference to the Imperial Order of Avis. Although, since the deposition in 1889 of the last Brazilian monarch, Emperor Pedro II, the order continues as a house order being awarded by the Heads of the House of Orleans-Braganza, pretenders to the defunct throne of Brazil. The current Brazilian Imperial Family is split into two branches Petr√≥polis and Vassouras, and as a consequence the Grand Mastership of the Order is disputed between those two branches. History The Imperial Order of St. Benedict of Avis was founded by Emperor Pedro I of Brazil upon the independence of the country in 1822. It was regularized only in 1842 by Emperor Pedro II. Unlike the other orders that were abolished by the Provisional Government of the Republic, the Order of St. Benedict of Avis and the Order of the Southern Cross were initially preserved from extinction but were kept restricted to military personnel only, under the Decree of the Provisional Government number 227-F of 22 March 1890. However, all remaining Orders of Knighthood, including the Order of St. Benedict of Avis, and even the newly created Order of Columbus (that had been created by the Provisional Government of the Republic on 6 June 1890), with exception of the Order of the Southern Cross, were declared abolished upon the adoption of the new Republic's first Constitution, on 24 February 1891 (due to a clause in the Constitution that extinguished all titles of nobility and orders of knighthood). However, this constitutional provision was interpreted as prohibiting the granting of new titles and the awarding of new knighthoods, and as abolishing the Orders themselves (as organized entities), but not as prohibiting the use of titles and honours receiving in the past, and therefore people who had been granted noble titles or positions in the Orders of Knighthood before their extinction were allowed the said titles and the insignia of the Order. Accordingly, the Order of St. Benedict of Aviz only effectively died out once all those who had been admitted to it prior to 1981 had died. In spite of the abolition of the Order, Decree No. 4328 of 15 November 1901 created a military medal named after the extinct Order: the Medal of the Military Order of Avis.

Career A child prodigy, Bianca first studied with her mother and then with Frank Sheridan at Mannes Music School and Isabella Vergerova at the Curtis Institute of Music. This led to what is documented as an amazing performance as a nine-year-old of a Mozart piano concerto, played from memory, for the New York Philharmonic - which led to her later appearing with this orchestra as a soloist.Winter Park Topics, Florida, Vol. 22, No. 2, January 14, 1955 Her career, therefore, started before the age of ten, at which time she was a soloist with the Schenectady Symphony Orchestra and performed over CBC Radio in their French division. Later in her career, she performed in Europe with the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hans-Jurgen Walther, the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra conducted by Carl-August B√ºnte and the New Symphony Society Orchestra conducted by Walter Goehr among others. One of her notable American performances was on January 20, 1955, when she was the guest soloist with the Florida Symphony conducted by Frank Miller. The programme included Andre Bloch's \\"Concerto No. 1\\", Liszt's \\"Concerto in E flat\\", Glinka's Overture to \\"Russian and Ludmilla\\", Handel's \\"Water Music\\" and Georges Enesco's \\"Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1\\". Another notable performance was the piece Rhapsody 21 for the Century 21 Exposition, conducted by Paul Whiteman. One of the specialties in her repertoire was George Gershwin's \\"Piano Concerto in F\\". Due to its ban in Nazi Germany it was unpopular in that country for many years. Recent study has shown that she may have been the first to perform the concerto in that country after the end of World War II. After retiring from live performances, she continued teaching other young pianists. Due to her early exit from performing, she is regarded as something of a mystery by modern enthusiasts of her surviving recordings. Pseudonym recordings For reasons unclear, her recordings were released on various budget record labels under a handful of pseudonyms. Some of these names include: Albert Cohen, Karl Bernhard, Frederick Antenelli, David Haines and Suzanne Auber.

Turpentine Jake was performed Aug. 1 ‚Äì 24, 2008, at the Del Rey Theatre, in Los Angeles, CA. It received two NAACP Theatre Award nominations.  Summary  The turpentiners worked fourteen hours a day harvesting pine gum from longleaf pine trees during the period between 1890 and 1960. These men were held under debt peonage, earning less than the cost of food and clothing provided by the company store. Turpentine Jake is on the true story of Hurd's grandfather and oral histories gathered from surviving turpentine workers. The play follows Jake, a legendary storyteller and mentor to those in the camps, as he spins tales and songs that help his fellow workers assert some control over their oppressive environment. A drama with music and original folktales, Turpentine Jake has a total of twenty-one roles. Turpentine Jake's premiere was staged in workshop at Loyola Marymount University's Del Rey Theatre.

They are used to secure the two sides together and are available in a variety of materials for different temperature and chemical environments. Plastic joint clips Plastic joint clips are usually made of polyacetal, and are colored according to joint sizes. Polyacetal melts at a reasonably low temperature (around 175 ¬∞C) and begins to soften around 140 ¬∞C. As glassware temperatures are recommended up to 250 ¬∞C, care needs to be taken that clips made from this material are not being used to hold glass together that will get this hot. Typical problem areas include a flask over the plate (which may drop off the end of the column as it gets hot) and the connection the condenser makes to the still head (which will reach high temperatures and may allow the condenser to fall off). As such, different clips should be used at these points or the glassware should be clamped such that these elements can't slide apart or don't need the clip. Polyacetal clips suffer another problem in that the material is strongly affected by the corrosive gases. This effect can be so dramatic that the clip will fall apart in minutes of exposure to minute quantities leaking through even greased, ground tapers. Importantly, this failure mode is sudden and without warning. PTFE joint clips PTFE joint clips are sometimes used, as its recommended temperature peak matches that of most practical chemistry work. Its highly inert nature also makes it immune to degradation around the corrosive gases. However, it is both expensive and will begin producing hydrogen fluoride if heated to beyond its specified temperature; so care must be taken to avoid this, given the level of risk the result presents. The same is true of using Krytox and chemically resistant Molykote (PTFE thickened, fluoro-based) oils and greases for glassware seals. High grade stainless steel joint clips A high grade stainless steel joint clip is a final option. Naturally, this can withstand the entire temperature spectrum of borosilicate glass and is reasonably inert. Some glassware features barbs (Devil's horns / Viking helmet) sticking out the sides of the tapers. Small stainless steel springs are used on these to hold the joint together. The use of springs is of particular benefit when dealing with positive pressures, as they apply enough force for the glass to operate, but will open the taper if an unexpected excursion occurs. This method is considered quite old fashioned, but is still used on some of the most well known and high end glassware available.

The term jailbait is derived from the fact that engaging in sexual activity with someone who is under the age of consent is classified as statutory rape or by an equivalent term.In the U.S. State of California, there is no such crime of \\"statutory rape,\\" as the term \\"rape\\" is used specifically as penetration by force. The equivalent crime is \\"unlawful sexual intercourse\\" as defined by Sec. 261.5 of the California Penal Code. The minor deemed sexually attractive is thus a temptation to an older person to pursue them for sexual relations at the risk of being sent to jail if caught. Criteria As the legal age of consent varies by country and jurisdiction, the age at which a person can be considered \\"jailbait\\" varies. For example, in the United Kingdom, where the age of consent is 16, the term is used to refer to those younger than 16, whereas in some parts of the United States, where the age of consent is 18, the term would refer to those aged under 18. The frequent use of the term jailbait in popular culture has been linked to a greater understanding of age of consent laws among teenagers.

It is the 65th Oswald cartoon by Walter Lantz Productions and the 117th in the entire series. Plot Oswald and the girl beagle (making her debut in this film) are at the fair, dancing on a wooden platform. All of a sudden, a large oppressive pit bull pulls it right under their feet, much to their surprise. The pit bull pretends to apologize by giving Oswald a handshake but snaps a rat trap at the rabbit's hand instead. When the large dog flirts with the girl beagle, the annoyed Oswald quickly takes her and walks out of the scene. Oswald and his date go to a refreshment stand to order ice cream sodas. Upon receiving their beverages, the pit bull shows up again, takes Oswald's drink, and consumes it. The girl beagle doesn't drink hers but instead pours the stuff in the pit bull's hat without the latter noticing. As the big dog puts on the hat and gets covered in a creamy mess, the two little tourists immediately move to another location. After spending a few moments at the punch pad game which the pit bull got smashed by the machine on his head making the pit bull to feel dazed, Oswald and the girl beagle decide to have a ride. They select a bizarre one operated by a marsupial. The girl beagle is the first to go as the marsupial launches her high in the air where she lands and slides onto a series of animals. In the end, however, she is nabbed by the pit bull. Oswald comes to her assistance by picking up a bow and shooting arrows at the pit bull's back. Due to this, the large dog drops the girl beagle and sets sights on the rabbit. Running from the pit bull, Oswald climbs and crawls through a small hole in the fence. The large dog attempts to get through too, only to get stuck halfway. The rabbit then draws a picture of a rat on the pit bull's rear, attracting a stray cat and then a hound, both of which go in a mauling fashion. Eventually, the pit bull is able to get out of the situation and continues pursuing Oswald. Oswald, still on the run, enters a gate to the backyard of a house. Instead of going in also, the pit bull peeks through one of the windows. While his pursuer is still looking in, Oswald appears in front of the house from a distance and throws a stick at the other window, breaking the glass. The disturbed homeowner opens the door in the blink of an eye, therefore smashing the pit bull between it and the front wall. Oswald writes a \\"welcome\\" message on the flattened dog before placing the latter in front of the door. The girl beagle then shows up in the vicinity, happily calling Oswald. She and the rabbit go to celebrate things with a kiss. Availability The short is available on The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection: Volume 2 DVD box set.

Ethiopian nationalism ( ƒ™tyop'iyawƒ´net) also referred as Ethiopianism or Ethiopianness and Pan-Ethiopian nationalism, asserts that Ethiopians are a nation and promotes the cultural unity and all ethnic groups have equality rights and constitute sovereignty. Ethiopian nationalism is a type of civic nationalism in that it is multi-ethnic and promotes diversity. Ethiopian civic nationalism is in contrast to ethno-nationalist supremacy fueled by ethnic federalist policies. History Painting depicting the Battle of Adwa of 1896 where Ethiopian forces were victorious over invading Italian forces. The victory is cherished as an example of Ethiopia upholding its independence against European colonial powers, and is annually celebrated in Ethiopia in Victory at Adwa Day. The conception of an Ethiopian nation by Ethiopian nationalists is stated to have begun with the Aksumite Kingdom in the 4th century A.D. The Aksumite Kingdom was a predominantly Christian state that at the height of its power controlled what is now the Ethiopian Highlands, Eritrea, and the coastal regions of Southern Arabia. The Aksumite Kingdom was responsible for the development of the religious movement that became the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. However, the expansion of Islam in the 7th century caused the decline of the Aksumite Kingdom, and most of the lowland populations converted to Islam, while the highland people remained Christian. Since the Aksumite people became divided between Christian highlands and Islamic lowlands, religious and tribal tensions and rivalries between the people intensified. The Aksumite society changed into a loose confederation of city-states that maintained the language of Aksum. The establishment of modern Ethiopia was led by the Shawan people, particularly Amhara emperors Tewodros II of Gondar, who governed from 1855 to 1868, Yohannis IV, who was from Tigre governed from 1869 to 1889 and managed to expand his authority into Eritrea, and Menelik II, who governed from 1889 to 1913 and repelled the Italian invasion of 1896. Ethiopia, unlike the rest of Africa, had never been colonized. Ethiopia was accepted as the first independent African-governed state at the League of Nations in 1922. Ethiopia was occupied by Italy after the Second Italo- Abyssinian War, but it was liberated by the Allies during World War II. After the war, Ethiopia annexed Eritrea. However, ethnic tensions surged between the Amhara and the Eritrean, Oromo, Somali, and Tigray peoples, each of whom had formed separatist movements dedicated to leaving Amhara-dominated Ethiopia. After the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy by the Derg military junta, the country became aligned with the Soviet Union and Cuba after the United States failed to support it in its military struggle with Somali separatists in the Ogaden region. After the end of military government in Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea separated from Ethiopia.  Legacy of independence  In March 1896 a definitive battle took place between the forces of colonial Italy, and those of the Ethiopian Empire in a town in northern Ethiopia called Adwa. The battle was short but extremely violent with tens of thousands of deaths. At the time Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia had mobilized the Ethiopian people regardless of class and ethnicities. The mobilization drive would see millions of Ethiopian Citizens march from their towns, villages, and cities into the Northern Highlands for the preservation of their African Empire. This battle would end in a decisive victory for Ethiopia, marking the country with a unique legacy of independence in the face of European Aggression.Jonas, Raymond. The Battle of Adwa: African Victory in the Age of Empire. Harvard University Press, 2011, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt24hjxj. The battle of Adwa is the foundation for Ethiopian Nationalist ideology. For many Ethiopians, the threat of foreign invasion is the rallying cry for patriotic sacrifices and nationalist ideologues. By the time the battle of Adwa took place almost all of Africa was dominated by European forces. Ethiopian independence broke the mold of European superiority & provided a beacon of hope for black nations and peoples around the world. For many Ethiopians this moment represents a transitional moment, in which the nation realized its teleological doctrine. While the first war against Italy was a uniting war, the 1934 invasion by Benito Mussolini was extremely divisive. In Observation on the Ethiopian Nation Charles McClellan argues that the Italo-Abyssinian war of 1934 was in fact \\"as much a civil war as one against foreign aggression.\\"‚ÄúObservations on the Ethiopian Nation, Its Nationalism, and the Italo-Ethiopian War.‚Äù Northeast African Studies, vol. 3, no. 1, 1996, pp. 57‚Äì86. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/41931125. McClellan argues that the political and factional differences which emerged in Ethiopia prior to the war, were not resolved by the Italian invasion but instead were amplified. This in the authors opinion led to an era of bitter factionalism which would \\"define the dynamics of post-war Ethiopian politics.\\"  Era of ethnic federalism  Since 1992 hitherto the appointment of Abiy Ahmed as Prime Minister the TPLF has had almost complete control of the government leveraging its power to concentrate wealth and development into the Tigray Region. The hegemonic rule of the Tigray people in Ethiopia was in many ways a reaction to the singular rule of Amharas for centuries. The hegemonic rule of a single ethnic group has marginalized many groups within Ethiopia and has led to a cycle of violence and retribution. In the early 1990s the TPLF believed that through an ethnic federalist state system, one in which regions were assigned and divided by ethnic population, they could \\"reduc[e] the inter-ethnic conflict that has divided Ethiopian society for centuries; (2) promot[e] equitable material conditions in all areas of the country; and (3) improv[e] the efficiency and effectiveness of public sector performance at the field level. They argued they could use political and administrative devolution to promote these objectives without threatening other important objectives, such as economic growth and political stability.\\"Cohen, John M. ‚Äú‚ÄòEthnic Federalism‚Äô in Ethiopia.‚Äù Northeast African Studies, vol. 2, no. 2, 1995, pp. 157‚Äì188. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41931208. While these region weren't given \\"extensive sub-national control over technical policies, laws, regulations, and tax\\" their creation lent credibility to the different independence and ethnic movements around the country. For Ethiopian Nationalists, this credibility has emboldened different groups, giving them more cohesion, whilst corroding national unity and notions of Ethiopianism. The increased autonomy of these groups contrasted with the increased repression by Tigray elites created a situation in which the ruling class was both empowering groups through greater ethnic cohesion, but transparently stifling their political will. As evidenced by the 2005 elections the TPLF use of violent repression to subdue detractors of the ruling coalition only had the effect of radicalizing ethnic parties and increasing ethnic divisions. Many Ethiopian nationalists view the system of ethnic federalism as having made governing in Ethiopia a zero sum game. To win power in Ethiopia is to deny any other ethnic group significant power. By expelling notions of Ethiopianism from the national political dialogue the TPLF has increased the ethnic cleavages and created a system revolving around ethnic affiliation, void of political ideology. In 2015 \\"after a master plan was unveiled to expand the boundaries of the capital, Addis Ababa\\" into Oromia thousands of Oromo Youth took up to the streets demanding increased political representation, an end to the TPLF sponsored Master Plan, and avenues of dissent.Kestler-D'Amours, Jillian. ‚ÄúEthiopia: Mass Protests 'Rooted in Country's History'.‚Äù GCC News Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera, 20 Feb. 2018, www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/02/ethiopia- mass-protests-rooted-country-history-180219130441837.html. Although the ruling party tried to blunt these protests through physical force they only grew and Amhara \\"angered by an unfulfilled demand to retake control of some of their lands\\" launched protests demanding proportional political representation and influence. After a 10-month state of emergency imposed by the TPLF, which saw the abdication of prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Abiy Amhed was selected by the ruling EPDRF coalition as the next prime minister due to his Oromo ancestry. Since taking power he has taken up major reforms allowing back political dissidents, releasing some political prisoners, and liberalizing the economy.Burke, Jason. ‚Äú'These Changes Are Unprecedented': How Abiy Is Upending Ethiopian Politics.‚Äù The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 8 July 2018, www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/08/abiy-ahmed-upending-ethiopian-politics. While his drive to reform and democratize the nation have garnered him support across the country he still has not addressed the fundamental issues of the Ethnic Federalist system, which in the nationalist opinion is the root cause for ethnic patronage politics and tensions. Ethiopian nationalists believe that Ethnic Federalism must be ended to shift Ethiopian politics from ethnic patronage to ideology, it must be ended to induce national cohesion and blunt sectarian loyalty, and through the blunting of ethnic cohesion induce an era of unity and prosperity.Ethiopia's influential Lion of Judah flag.

Rick Santorum had won the strawpoll at the Legislative Districts caucuses on Super Tuesday with a large margin to Ron Paul in second place and Mitt Romney in third place. The state party's national delegate nominating committee recommended a slate of delegates based on participation in the party. There was no requirement that the delegates personally support any particular candidate. The slate was merely a means for the party's nominating committee to place names into nomination at the convention based on criteria that weighted previous participation in and financial support for the party. Additional names were nominated at the convention itself and the national delegates and alternates were elected by the state convention delegates. State Party rules only required that the national delegates chosen at the state convention caucus before or at the national convention and determine whether or how to reflect the previous strawpoll result. In August, 2012, the national delegation caucused in Tampa, Florida, at the Republican National Convention, and allowed each national delegate to vote their own conscience. According to Santorum and Paul supporters the slate placed into nomination by the party's nominating committee should have lived up to the strawpoll result, but instead gave Romney a large majority of the delegates. This misunderstanding of state party rules and procedures lead former NDGOP Chairman Gary Emineth to call the vote undemocratic and a railroad job.

Oil droplets are found in the eyes of some animals, being located in the photoreceptor cells. They are especially common in the eyes of diurnal (active during the day) reptiles (e.g. lizards, turtles) and birds (see bird vision), though are present in other taxa such as lungfish. They are found in cone cells far more often than in rods, suggesting a role in colour vision. Occurrence in rod cells may imply that they have been modified from a cone cell ancestor. They occasionally occur in double cones/double rods. Some oil droplets are coloured, while others appear colourless. They are located in the cone inner segment, where they intercept and filter light before it can pass through to the cone outer segment where the visual pigment is. The adaptive advantage of oil droplets is not firmly established. Coloured oil droplets have a cost in that they reduce the amount of light available to the visual system. They also reduce the overlap in spectral sensitivity between different types of cone (e.g. short wavelength sensitive, medium wavelength sensitive etc.). This can be a benefit because it increases the number of colours that can be discriminated, and calculations by Vorobyev (2003) support the hypothesis that this is of net benefit.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Constructed in 1913, the Robidoux House is a one-and-a-half-story, cross-gabled brick bungalow and is an excellent example of the Craftsman architectural style. The city of Aurora, Colorado, has very few examples of Craftsman brick bungalows that are left in the area, making this house particularly significant. History Mary Jane Lavina Girard Robidoux, the widow of Albert Robidoux, a successful wheat farmer and rancher from Kansas, commissioned the construction of the house at 1615 Galena Street in 1913. Mrs. Robidoux moved to Aurora, Colorado, following her husband's untimely death in 1912. Mrs. Robidoux had adequate financial resources and invested in the design and construction of one of the finest Craftsman-style brick bungalows in Aurora. It is no surprise Mrs. Robidoux wanted her new home to be located on Aurora's most affluent street: ‚ÄúSilk Stocking Row‚Äù as it was referred. According to the Aurora Democrat dated October 3, 1913, the Robidoux House was ‚Äúfinest house yet erected in Aurora.‚Äù There have only been four families including Mrs. Robidoux, who have resided at 1615 Galena Street and much still remains of the original house. Mrs. Robidoux died in her home in June1 929. She left the house to St. Clara's Orphanage as a memorial to her late husband Albert. The rest of her estate was split up between nieces, nephews, and surviving siblings. St. Clara's Orphanage sold the house to the Cornelius Muldoon family in 1930. The Muldoons lovingly cared for the woodwork for over 60 years (from 1930 to 1996). It was said that the matriarch of the family, Clare Muldoon, never allowed anything other than cheesecloth to be used for dusting. In the 1940s, this house had the highest assessed value of any residence in Aurora. St. Clara's Orphanage sold the house to the Cornelius Muldoon family in 1930. Mr. Muldoon became sick in World War I from mustard gas and sought medical help as a disabled veteran from the Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Aurora. The Muldoons had two young sons who still live in the neighborhood today, Neil and Felix. They tell stories about how their mother was so grateful to have the lovely home that she took great care of it and would not allow them to scuff any of the woodwork. During the Depression, their mother served bread and soup out of the back porch to men passing through from the railway station looking for work. Mrs. Muldoon died in 1984, after which a family member moved in and lived in the house until 1996. The family sold it to non-family members at this time. In 2007, the current owners bought the house and completed some minor restoration of the wood floors and staircase damaged over the years. They also remodeled the kitchen to modernize it, but saved the old sink, which is kept in the basement along with what appears to be the original stove and clothes washing machine. A large kitchen buffet moved to the back porch is still used today.

Their two most recent albums, released through Victory Records and Pure Noise Records, have received critical acclaim from Rock Sound and Exclaim! magazines. They are among the most visible bands within contemporary melodic hardcore, while they are also considered one of the major powers of the metalcore revival wave. History Formation and Prophets (2007-2010) Counterparts formed in Hamilton, Ontario in 2007. Counterparts consisted of vocalist Brendan \\"B\\" Murphy, guitarist Jesse Doreen, guitarist Curtis Washik, bassist Eric Bazinet, and drummer Ryan Juntilla. In 2009, Washik departed from the band, and Alex Re joined the band temporarily as their guitarist before becoming their permanent guitarist. In March 2009 Counterparts toured Canada. In 2010 Shane Told, from the band Silverstein, signed them to his Verona Records label. Lead vocalist Brendan Murphy was featured on the song \\"The Artist\\" on Silverstein's fifth album, Rescue. He also appeared in their music video. The band's debut album Prophets was released 23 February 2010 on label Verona Records. In 2010, Juntilla left the band, and was replaced by Chris Needham. A split EP, featuring Needham on drums was released 21 November 2010 with Hardcore punk band Exalt. The band toured North America in support of the album, which was inspired by Mussy. The Current Will Carry Us (2011‚àí2012) In spring of 2011, the band was signed to Victory Records. The band continued to tour until the summer of 2011, when they announced that they were recording a new album. During this time, Needham left the band to see a speech therapist. A search for their next drummer was started, but ultimately, Juntilla rejoined the band, just in time to start recording for their second album, The Current Will Carry Us. The Current Will Carry Us was released 24 October 2011 on Victory. A music video was released for the song \\"Jumping Ship\\". Music critic Andrew Kelham, of Rock Sound magazine, gave a rating of 8 to the album. He called it \\"brilliant\\" and stated that The Current Will Carry Us \\"is a great first impression for the many who are yet to become acquainted with the Canadian melodic-yet-frenetic hardcore quintet.\\" Kiel Hume of Exclaim! magazine writes that Counterparts have the energy, talent, and attitude to wake up the genre. He states: \\"The Current Will Carry Us basically does that to a genre many people thought was on its last breath.\\" Kyle Brownlee, formerly of Canadian deathcore band Majesty, filled in for Juntilla for the entirety of the band's Canadian headliner tour, later on in summer of 2012, it was announced that Juntilla departed from Counterparts because he no longer wanted to be a part of the band. In the same announcement, the band appointed Kelly Bilan, formerly of I Am Committing a Sin and Dead and Divine, to be his replacement Days after the announcement, bassist Eric Bazinet commented on his Tumblr page that Juntilla had left the band in February and most of the members have not spoken to him since then. He had left to pursue interests in a band he was in during Counterparts. Bazinet added that on their last tour with Juntilla, \\"he was especially uninterested.\\" The Difference Between Hell and Home, Tragedy Will Find Us and Lineup changes (2013‚àí2016) The band's third album The Difference Between Hell and Home was released on 24 July 2013 to positive critical reception. A music video for the track \\"Witness\\" was posted ten days prior to the release of the album. In late 2013, guitarist Alex Re posted on his personal Facebook page that he had left Counterparts and would be playing his last show with the band at their hometown show in December. He was later replaced by Adrian Lee. In 2014, bassist Eric Bazinet announced that after seven years, he was leaving the band to pursue a career, and to spend time with family. After Bazinet's departure, Blake Hardman from Hundredth filled in on bass for the band on the Fuck the Message Tour that was headlined by Stick to Your Guns. Shortly afterwards, the guitarist of Kills and Thrills, Brian Kaczmarczyk, joined on bass, becoming the only non-Canadian member of the band. In the spring of 2015, vocalist Brendan Murphy announced in an interview that their fourth album, Tragedy Will Find Us, is expected to be released in the summer of 2015. On 23 April, the band announced that they have signed to Pure Noise Records, and New Damage Records. Pure Noise will release their upcoming album in the U.S., while New Damage will release it in Canada. The fourth album was released in July 2015. As of 2016, original guitarist Jesse Doreen and long time drummer Kelly Bilan have left the band, leaving Brendan Murphy as the last original member. Blake Hardman returned to the band as permanent member as Doreen's replacement. Likewise, Kyle Brownlee returned to the band as a permanent member as Bilan's replacement. Tyler Williams, a bandmate of Hardman's in Nashville hardcore act on Point, also joined the band during this period. It was announced in March 2017 the band would play the 22nd annual Vans Warped Tour. Counterparts entered the studio in March‚ÄìApril 2017, with Will Putney of Graphic Nature Audio at the production helm once again. Vocalist Brendan Murphy announced that he started a new band with members of Fit For An Autopsy, Misery Signals and Reign Supreme called END. They released an EP called From the Unforgiving Arms of God. You're Not You Anymore (2017‚àípresent) The band's fifth album, You're Not You Anymore, was released on 22 September 2017 via New Damage / Pure Noise Records. They have also shared singles from the album, called Haunt Me, Bouquet, and No Servant of Mine. You're Not You Anymore was the first recorded effort without the participation of Doreen due to his departure from Counterparts. The band did not let lineup changes derail their creativity and spirits. Playing an important role in the modern melodic hardcore scene, their new album is considered to have a different set of influences and a more refined sound. Odyssey states: \\"The rawness of Poison The Well's and Misery Signal's technical but absolutely emotionally devastating take on metalcore are influences they wear on their sleeve, tied together with the tortured poetry of Brendan Murphy‚Äôs lyrics.\\" Members Current(2019), New Damage Records, Counterparts, http://newdamagerecords.com/bands/counterparts, Retrieved, 2019(2019), Deming, Mark, https://www.allmusic.com/artist/counterparts-mn0002785997/biography, Retrieved, 10 April 2019 * Brendan Murphy ‚Äì lead vocals (2007-present) * Alex Re ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, clean vocals (2009-2013; 2019-present) * Kyle Brownlee ‚Äì drums, percussion (2012, 2016, 2017-present) * Blake Hardman ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals (2016-present), bass (2014, 2017) * Tyler Williams ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals (2017-present) Former * Curtis Washik ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2007-2009) * Chris Needham ‚Äì drums, percussion (2010-2011) * Ryan Juntilla ‚Äì drums, percussion (2007-2010; 2011-2012) * Adrian Lee ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2013-2019), bass (2017) * Eric Bazinet ‚Äì bass (2007-2014) * Jesse Doreen ‚Äì lead guitar (2007-2016) * Kelly Bilan ‚Äì drums, percussion (2012-2016) * Brian Kaczmarczyk ‚Äì bass guitar (2014-2017) * Ben Leathem ‚Äì drums, percussion (2016-2017) Timeline Discography Studio albums * Prophets (2010) * The Current Will Carry Us (2011) * The Difference Between Hell and Home (2013) ‚Äì No. 49 US Billboard Indie, No. 7 US Billboard Heatseekers * Tragedy Will Find Us (2015) ‚Äì No. 117 US Billboard 200 * You're Not You Anymore (2017) No. 112 US Billboard 200 * Nothing Left to Love (2019) No. 97 US Billboard 200 EPs * Counterparts - Untitled four-song EP (2008) * Counterparts / Exalt Split (2010) * Counterparts Live on Audiotree (2016) * Private Room (2018) Singles *Selfishly I Sink (2018) *Purer Form of Pain - Nothing Left to Love B-Sides (2020) Music videos * \\"Jumping Ship\\" (2011) * \\"The Disconnect\\" (2012) * \\"Witness\\" (2013) * \\"Burn\\" (2015) * \\"Collapse\\" (2015) * \\"Stranger\\" (2016) * \\"Bouquet\\" (2017) * \\"Swim Beneath My Skin\\" (2017) * \\"You're Not You Anymore\\" (2018) * \\"Paradise and Plague\\" (2019)  References  External links * Counterparts at Victory Records * Counterparts at CBC Radio 3 Category:Melodic hardcore groups Category:Canadian metalcore musical groups Category:Musical groups from Hamilton, Ontario Category:2007 establishments in Ontario Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Victory Records artists Category:Musical quintets Category:Pure Noise Records artists ","title":"Counterparts (band)"},{"id":"34353697","text":"Flag of Austria Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square) in Vienna with the statue of Archduke Charles of Austria in front of Hofburg Palace, Charles was Austria's main military leader who fought against France during the Napoleonic Wars. Austrian nationalism is the nationalism that asserts that Austrians are a nation and promotes the cultural unity of Austrians. Austrian nationalism originally developed as a cultural nationalism that emphasized a Catholic religious identity. This in turn led to its opposition to unification with Protestant-majority Prussia, something that was perceived as a potential threat to the Catholic core of Austrian national identity. Austrian nationalism first arose during the Napoleonic Wars, with Joseph von Hormayr as a prominent Austrian nationalist political leader at the time.Owen Connelly. The French revolution and Napoleonic era. Harcourt College Publishers, 1999. Pp. 254. In the 1930s the Fatherland Front government of Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg rejected current pan-German aspirations to join Austria with a Protestant-dominated Germany, whilst not wholly rejecting a potential union and claiming that any unification of Austria with Germany would require a federal German state where Austria and Austrians were guaranteed privileged status recognizing an Austrian nation within a German Kulturnation.Discursive Construction of National Identity. P. 52. Following the events of World War II and Nazism, Austrians began to reject the German identity, and a broader Austrian identity replaced it. After the war, there were those who went as far as describing Austria as \\"Hitler's first victim\\". In the post-World War II period proponents who recognize an Austrian nation have rejected a German identity of Austrians and have emphasized the non-German heritage among the Austrian population including Celtic, Illyrian, Roman, and Slavic.. Proponents who recognize Austrians as a nation claim that Austrians have Celtic heritage, as Austria is the location of the first characteristically Celtic culture (Halstatt culture) to exist.Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason. Encyclopedia of European Peoples. Infobase Publishing, 2006. P. 42. Contemporary Austrians express pride in having Celtic heritage and Austria possesses one of the largest collections of Celtic artifacts in Europe.Kevin Duffy. Who Were the Celts? Barnes & Noble Publishing, 1996. P. 20. Austrian nationalism has been challenged internally. The main rival nationalism has been German nationalism. Another rival nationalism emerged after the defeat of Austria-Hungary in World War I, Bavarian nationalism which challenged the new Austrian Republic with proposals for Austria to join Bavaria.Suda Lorena Bane, Ralph Haswell Lutz. Organization of American Relief in Europe, 1918-1919: Including Negotiations Leading Up to the Establishment of the Office of Director General of Relief at Paris by the Allied and Associated Powers. Stanford University Press, 1943. P. 119. At this time the Bavarian government held particular interest in incorporating the regions of North Tyrol and Upper Austria into Bavaria.. This was a serious issue in the aftermath of World War I with significant numbers of Austria's North Tyrolese declaring their intention to have North Tyrol join Bavaria.. History Josef von Hormayr, the prominent Austrian nationalist political leader during the Napoleonic Wars. Rally of the Fatherland's Front in 1936. The Napoleonic Wars were the cause of the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, and ultimately the cause for the quest for a German nation state in 19th-century German nationalism. German nationalism began to rise rapidly within the German Confederation, in 1866 the feud between the two most powerful German states Austria and Prussia finally came to a head in the German war in 1866. The Austrians favoured the Greater Germany unification but were not willing to give up any of the non-German- speaking land inside of the Austrian Empire and take second place to Prussia. The Prussians however wanted to unify Germany as Little Germany primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia, whilst excluding Austria. In the final battle of the German war (Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz) the Prussians successfully defeated the Austrians and succeeded in creating the North German Confederation. In 1871, Germany was unified as a nation-state as the German Empire that was Prussian- led and without Austria. Nevertheless, the integration of the Austrians remained a strong desire for many people of both Austria and Germany, especially among the liberals, the social democrats and also the Catholics who were a minority within the Protestant Germany. The idea of uniting all ethnic Germans into one state began to be challenged with the rise of Austrian nationalism within the Christian Social Party that identified Austrians on the basis of their predominantly Catholic religious identity as opposed to the predominantly Protestant religious identity of the Prussians. Following the end of World War I in the rump state of German-Austria, many Austrians desired to be united with Germany. More than 90% of interbellum Austrians identified as Catholic.. With the rise of Engelbert Dollfuss to power in Austria in 1932 and the creation of the Fatherland's Front, the Dolfuss government promoted Austrian nationalism and claimed that Catholic Austria would not accept joining a Protestant Germany or \\"heathen\\" Nazi-led Germany. Dollfuss accepted that Austrians were Germans but rejected the idea of Catholic Austrians submitting themselves to be taken over by a Protestant-dominated Germany, and instead claimed that Austria needed to revive itself and recognize the greatness of its history such as its Habsburg dynasty having been the leading part of the German Holy Roman Empire, and that when Austria restored itself, it would found a federal state of Germany that would recognize Germany as a Kulturnation, but would also recognize Austria as having a privileged place within such a federal state and the existence of an Austrian nation within the German Kulturnation. The Dollfuss/Schnuschnigg government did not deny that Austrians were Germans but opposed annexation into Germany especially under the Nazi regime. An independent survey conducted in early 1938 revealed that 60 percent of Austrians at that time favoured union with Germany, while 40 percent were opposed. After German troops entered Austria in March 1938, the Nazis forced the issue of annexation in a referendum in which under Nazi supervision 99 percent of the Austrian (excluding non-Aryans) voters in the referendum voted in favour of annexation of Austria to Germany, the Anschluss was met with a huge welcome from the Austrian Germans. The relationship between Austrian Catholicism, national identity, and fascism has been a source of controversy.. After the fall of Nazi Germany and the events from this and World War II, Austrians began to develop a more distinct national identity. Unlike earlier in the 20th century, in 1987 only 6 percent of the Austrians identified themselves as \\"Germans\\". In 2008, over 90 percent of the Austrians saw themselves as an independent nation.

Reportedly, he was also involved in negotiating the release of Jetstar executives in Vietnam in the wake of Jetstar Pacific losing $US31 million on disputed fuel-hedging contracts in 2008. Epstein was recruited to BHP Billiton in late 2010 by CEO Marius Kloppers, to a new role as company's Head of Group Public Affairs This was speculated to be part of a response to the failure of $US40 billion bid for Potash Corp following a backlash over foreign ownership from Canadian politicians.

It is a 3-day annual event that celebrates creativity in all its forms. Every year has a guest nation, and an Indian language in focus. The Festival has emerged as an important event in the cultural calendar of the country representing, as it does, the rich and cosmopolitan ethos of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, as well as the vibrant culture of the modern Cyberabad.

Webster argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience and a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Webster endorses Gilbert Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies in The Concept of Mind (1949), and criticizes many other authors for their treatment of Freud and psychoanalysis. The book for which Webster may be best remembered, it has been called \\"brilliant\\" and \\"definitive\\", but has also been criticized for shortcomings of scholarship and argument. It formed part of the \\"Freud wars\\", an ongoing controversy around psychoanalysis. Summary Webster argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a pseudoscience and a disguised continuation of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. He describes psychoanalysis as \\"perhaps the most complex and successful\\" pseudoscience in history, and Freud as an impostor who sought to found a false religion. However, Webster also writes that, \\"My ultimate goal is not to humiliate Freud or to inflict mortal injury either on him or his followers. It is to interpret and illuminate his beliefs and his personality in order that we may better understand our own culture, our own history, and indeed, our own psychology. It is to this constructive attempt to analyse the nature and sources of Freud's mistakes that my title primarily refers.\\" He discusses the influence on Freud of the otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess and the biologist Ernst Haeckel. Webster writes that while Ernest Jones wrote The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1953-1957) with the avowed objective of correcting a \\"mendacious legend\\" about Freud, Jones replaced that negative with a positive legend. Webster maintains that Jones, \\"did not hesitate to retouch reality wherever it seemed to conflict with the portrait which he sought to create.\\" Webster argues that while Peter Gay's Freud: A Life for Our Time (1988) is presented an objective exercise in historical scholarship, and considers the failings of psychoanalysis and Freud's mistakes, Gay nonetheless retains a reverent attitude toward Freud, preserving the myths about him created by previous biographers. Webster called these myths the \\"Freud legend\\". He suggests that the acclaim the book received shows the persistence of the Freud legend, noting that with exceptions such as Peter Swales, many reviewers praised it, especially in Britain. He saw its appeal to supporters of psychoanalysis as being its favorable view of Freudian ideas. He endorses Gilbert Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies in The Concept of Mind (1949), suggesting that they imply that \\"theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature.\\" Webster writes that the philosopher Adolf Gr√ºnbaum's The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) has been criticized by Frank Cioffi, who rejects Gr√ºnbaum's portrayal of Freud as a philosophically astute investigator of human psychology. Webster argues that while the book contains much pertinent criticism of Freud, it has been overvalued by critics of psychoanalysis because of its overly theoretical and abstract style of argument, and has also distracted attention away from issues such as Freud's character. Webster compared the former psychoanalyst Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's The Assault on Truth (1984) to E. M. Thornton's The Freudian Fallacy (1983), finding both authors hostile towards Freud and psychoanalysis. However, he suggested that Masson nevertheless retained a partly positive view of Freud. Webster credited Masson with making some contributions to the history of psychoanalysis, but wrote that his central argument has not convinced either the psychoanalytic establishment or the majority of Freud's critics, as Masson accepted that Freud formulated the seduction theory on the basis of memories of childhood seduction provided by his patients, an account disputed by scholars such as Cioffi, Thornton, Han Isra√´ls, and Morton Schatzman, who have argued that Freud's original account of his therapeutic methods suggests that this is not what occurred. According to Webster, Freud's seduction theory maintained that episodes of childhood seduction would have a pathological effect only if the victim had no conscious recollection of them, and the purpose of his therapeutic sessions was not to listen to freely offered recollections but to encourage his patients to discover or construct scenes of which they had no recollection. Webster blamed Masson for encouraging the spread of the recovered memory movement by implying that most or all serious cases of neurosis are caused by child sexual abuse, that orthodox psychoanalysts were collectively engaged in a massive denial of this fact, and that an equally massive collective effort to retrieve painful memories of incest was required. Webster describes the critic Frederick Crews's The Memory Wars (1995) as one of the most significant contributions to the debate on recovered memory therapy. Webster writes that the psychologist Hans Eysenck's Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) contains many cogent criticisms of Freud, but criticizes Eysenck for uncritically accepting Elizabeth Thornton's argument that Joseph Breuer's patient Anna O. suffered from tuberculous meningitis. Webster writes that some of Thomas Szasz's arguments in The Myth of Mental Illness (1961) are similar to his, but that he disagrees with his view that hysteria was an emotional problem and that Jean- Martin Charcot's patients were not genuinely mentally ill. Webster concludes that no \\"negative critique\\" of psychoanalysis \\"can ever constitute an adequate refutation\\" of Freud's theories, because \\"bad theories can only be driven out by better theories.\\" Publication history Why Freud Was Wrong was first published in 1995 by HarperCollins. In 1996, an edition with an added preface was published. In 2005, an edition with a new postscript was published by The Orwell Press. The work has been translated into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Hungarian. Reception Media commentary Why Freud Was Wrong received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford in Publishers Weekly, the psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey in National Review, and the critic David Lodge in Commonweal, a mixed review from Dennis G. Twiggs in Library Journal, and a negative review from the historian Frank McLynn in New Statesman & Society. The book was also reviewed by Brenda Grazis in Booklist, the biographer Paul Ferris in The Spectator, the psychologist Stuart Sutherland in The Times Higher Education Supplement, R. H. Balsam in Choice, the psychiatrist Bob Johnson in New Scientist, Kate Chisholm in TES, Sarah Boxer in The New York Times Book Review, and discussed by the journalist Bob Woffinden in The Guardian. Stuttaford described the book as \\"a formidable critique of Freud's theories and modern psychoanalytic practice\\". Torrey called the book \\"scholarly and substantive\\". He suggested that Webster was well suited to the task of discussing the Christian roots of Freud's ideas and credited him with providing a detailed discussion of Freud's character that revealed its \\"unpleasant traits\\", though he considered his comment that Freud had a \\"sometimes less than scrupulous attitude toward truth\\" as an understatement. He found his discussion of the recovered memory movement one of the most interesting sections of the book. However, he criticized him for not providing more discussion of the cultural influence of Freudian theories, for failing to address \\"Freud's misogynistic teachings\\" and their effects on the women's movement, and for providing insufficient information about Freud's use of cocaine. Lodge considered the book \\"exceptionally searching, lucid, and well-argued\\", as well as \\"intellectually exciting\\" and \\"challenging\\", and noted that it was \\"linked to an ambitious project for a true science of human nature\\". He wrote that it was impossible to read it \\"without having one's respect for Freud shaken and diminished\\". However, he added that it was possible to \\"learn from it without accepting Webster's thesis that Freud's ideas were totally worthless.\\" He accepted Webster's argument that the growth of the psychoanalytic movement corresponds closely to the historical development of religions, but wrote that this does not necessarily discredit psychoanalysis. Twiggs described the book as readable, and wrote that it presented an effective argument and rivaled the psychiatrist Henri Ellenberger's The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970). However, he criticized Webster for failing to address the point that psychoanalysis added a \\"critical dimension to a growing theory of human behavior and spirituality\\". McLynn described the work as \\"the oddest book to come my way in years\\". He wrote that Webster made \\"the most savage attack ever mounted on Freud and psychoanalysis\\", and offered a confused and eclectic attempt to develop a general theory of human nature. In his view, the book failed to live up to the \\"grandiose claims\\" made by its publishers. He criticized Webster for maintaining that mental illness is misdiagnosed organic disease, for criticizing physicians and psychiatrists despite his lack of medical qualifications, for offering conjectural explanations of cases of hysteria and schizophrenia, for unreasonably insisting \\"that Freud should have acquainted us ... with every stage in his work with patients\\", and for misunderstanding psychoanalysis. He found Webster's criticisms of concepts such as \\"unconscious rage\\" unconvincing, accused him of \\"internal inconsistencies\\", and wrote that he \\"has a disconcerting habit of citing anti-Freudian authorities to bolster an argument and then rounding on them to claim that the rest of their anti- Freudian argument is false.\\" Woffinden suggested that Why Freud Was Wrong may be the book for which Webster is best remembered. Reviews in scientific and academic journals Why Freud Was Wrong received a positive review in the Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, a mixed review from Peter Swales in Nature, and a negative review from Hannah S. Decker in Isis. The book was also reviewed by John S. Callender in BMJ, the psychoanalyst John Lawrence in the Journal of Social Work Practice, and the evolutionary biologist George C. Williams in The Quarterly Review of Biology. The Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences described the book as a \\"a valuable contribution\\" to understanding Freud and credited Webster with \\"a thorough study of Freud‚Äôs life and works as well as of secondary sources\\". Swales wrote that while the book was advertised on its jacket as a comprehensive biography, Webster did not expand \\"factual knowledge of Freud's life and work\\", but rather engaged in a \\"relentless polemic\\" that was \\"flawed in its simplifications\\" but \\"lethal in its total impact.\\" He considered the book an important contribution despite being largely derivative. He considered Webster's evaluation of Freud as a person \\"provocative though tenable\\". He noted that Webster, despite not having a background in medicine, argued that Breuer's patient Anna O. suffered from \\"a severe neurological disorder\\" and that \\"its array of florid symptoms underwent spontaneous remission one after another.\\" He credited Webster with exposing many \\"empirical and logical\\" absurdities in Freud's views, and making a generally strong case against Freud. However, he was less convinced by Webster's attempt to minimize Freud's originality, finding it \\"wearisome\\". He argued that Webster lacked familiarity with the history of ideas in 19th-century Germany and Austria and was too \\"Anglo-centric\\" in his approach, and criticized him for devoting only half a page to Freud's most intellectually formative years, and ignoring published letters by Freud written during that period. He considered Webster, following Frank Sulloway, correct to emphasize that the development of Freud's theories after 1896 was mainly inspired by assumptions drawn from contemporary biology. However, he maintained that Webster was \\"oblivious to Freud's background in biology\\" and wrongly concluded that it was Fliess, rather than Haeckel, who led Freud to accept the view that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. He criticized Webster for failing to consider sources of Freudian theory such as Thomas Carlyle. He considered Webster's efforts to create a \\"new psychology\\", based on neo-Darwinism, unconvincing and wrote that Webster failed to explain what it would consist of. Decker wrote that Webster showed \\"a commendable command of the secondary literature\\", but described his book as \\"a work of total nihilism\\" and wrote that it contained \\"many factual errors\\" and was difficult to take seriously. Decker accepted that some of Webster's objections to Freud \\"had some substance\\", but in her view he destroyed the validity of these points by taking them to extremes. She gave as an example the way Webster moved from correctly noting that Freud \\"did hound some of his patients to give him the evidence he was looking for\\", to incorrectly concluding that all of his patients' accounts of seductions and fantasies were Freud's reconstructions, thereby undermining a sound observation. She agreed with Webster that not all dreams are wish fulfillments, but criticized him for not acknowledging that psychoanalysts have long abandoned the belief that they are. She considered Webster naive or ignorant to deny that \\"emotions can produce bodily phenomena\\", and criticized his discussion of Breuer's treatment of his patient Anna O. Other evaluations Why Freud Was Wrong was described as \\"brilliant\\" by the psychiatrist Anthony Storr and the biographer Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy, and \\"definitive\\" by the philosopher Raymond Tallis, but was criticized for shortcomings of scholarship and argument by the critic Elaine Showalter. In a preface to the 1998 edition of The Assault on Truth, first published in 1984, Masson wrote that Why Freud Was Wrong had received acclaim. However, he criticized Webster for blaming him for the current interest in recovered memories, writing that his interest in writing The Assault on Truth had nothing to do with the recovery of memories, and that he did not discuss the topic in any depth. Masson argued that Webster was incorrect to claim that there is no evidence that any of Freud's patients had been sexually abused. He also criticized Webster's views on recovered memory, writing that they ignored relevant evidence. The psychologist Louis Breger saw some of Webster's points as valuable, but concluded that Webster, like some other critics of Freud, too frequently jumps \\"from valid criticisms of some part of Freud's work to a condemnation of the whole.\\" The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani wrote that Why Freud Was Wrong was made possible by new scholarship on Freud, and formed part of the \\"Freud Wars\\", an ongoing controversy around psychoanalysis.

Webster critiques the freedom to blaspheme, and argues against The Crime of Blasphemy (which advocated the abolition of Britain's blasphemy laws \\"without replacement\\"). Summary Webster notes that he named the book after the fourth section of The Crime of Blasphemy, a pamphlet issued by the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie and his Publishers, and that his work is influenced by Karen Armstrong's Holy War (1988) and Norman Cohn's books The Pursuit of the Millennium (1957), Warrant for Genocide (1967), and Europe's Inner Demons (1975). He also approvingly cites Muslim writer Shabbir Akhtar's Be Careful With Muhammad! (1989).Webster 1990. pp. 14, 15, 39. Webster describes A Brief History of Blasphemy as \\"an attempt to show, without ever aspiring to completeness or comprehensiveness, that the picture of blasphemy which is presented by the authors of the International Committee's document is incomplete, and in some respects, seriously misleading.\\"Webster 1990. pp. 14, 39. Webster gives the controversy surrounding Monty Python's film The Life of Brian (1979), which he calls \\"a rather slight production\\" as a satire on religion, as an example of the way in which blasphemy has been restrained not by force of law but by internalised censorship.Webster 1990. p. 27. Publication history A Brief History of Blasphemy was first published in 1990 by The Orwell Press.Webster 1990. p. iv. Reception According to the journalist Bob Woffinden, A Brief History of Blasphemy was widely praised in the immediate aftermath of the controversy over The Satanic Verses.Woffinden 2011. Some reviewers suggested that Webster shows that liberal support for unrestricted freedom of speech is inconsistent with other liberal values, and demonstrates the religious origins of belief in freedom of expression. The book has been described as \\"thoughtful\\" and \\"closely argued\\" by the journalist Tim Radford,Radford 1990. and \\"energetic and ingenious\\" by academic Lorna Sage,Sage 1990. and Webster has been credited with explaining how \\"we have internalised puritan iconoclasm to the point where we mistake it for a secular universal truth\\", and with showing that the western liberal concept of \\"inner conscience\\" upon which the secularist arguments of The Crime of Blasphemy were founded is a secular transformation of Puritanism.McGuigan 1992. pp. 202-203. Commentators have interpreted A Brief History of Blasphemy as a broadly liberal critique of liberalism, or an attempt to criticize the liberal establishment on its own terms. Webster shows, in Petersson's view, that Rushdie combines a potentially violent and offensive code with the holiest Islamic traditions, and that the language in The Satanic Verses has a charge that he was too careless with.Petersson 1996. pp. 41, 204-205. According to Ruvani Ranashina, Webster shows that a civilised society should have constraints on the freedom to act in ways that have adverse effects on others, and that freedom without responsibility is dangerous, especially if offensive and damaging to a community. She believes his critique of the freedom to blaspheme implicitly supports the group of Muslims who unsuccessfully sought to invoke British blasphemy laws that applied only to Christianity against The Satanic Verses in 1989.Ranashina 2007. pp. 49-50. Webster has been credited by the novelist J. M. Coetzee with showing that \\"Rushdie has been made to stand for an entire intellectual establishment\\" that compounded the outrage The Satanic Verses caused to Muslims by celebrating it.Coetzee 1996. p. 234. His criticism of The Crime of Blasphemy (which advocated the abolition of Britain's blasphemy laws \\"without replacement\\") is seen as convincing by academic Jim McGuigan. French author Patrice Dartevielle described Webster's work as \\"anti-liberal\\" and condemned support for \\"repressive legislation\\" (i.e. new or renewed blasphemy laws), while also acknowledging that Webster's concern about Muslims was \\"noble\\".Dartevielle 2011. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the James Callaghan Memorial lecture \\"Religious Hatred and Religious Offence\\" delivered in January 2008, called the book \\"immensely intelligent\\", stating that Webster shows that absolute freedom of speech is neither desirable nor possible. Williams said that Webster \\"offers some extraordinary examples of 'liberal' aggression and ignorant bigotry\\" during the controversy over The Satanic Verses in 1989 and 1990, and that he approved of his argument that writers and dramatists who defend the right to offend religion show a lack of imagination, in that they fail to understand the possibility that offending religion may cause real mental suffering.Williams 2011.

Prog. Polym. Sci., 2013, 38, 63‚Äì235 It is a type of reversible- deactivation radical polymerization. A chain growth step in a nitroxide mediated polymerization process.  Alkoxyamine Initiators  The initiating materials for nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization (NMP) are a family of compounds referred to as alkoxyamines. An alkoxyamine can essentially be viewed as an alcohol bound to a secondary amine by an N-O single bond. The utility of this functional group is that under certain conditions, homolysis of the C-O bond can occur, yielding a stable radical in the form of a 2-center 3-electron N-O system and a carbon radical which serves as an initiator for radical polymerization.Moad, G., Rizzardo, E. Macromolecules, 1995, 28, 8722‚Äì8728. For the purposes of NMP, the R groups attached to the nitrogen are always bulky, sterically hindering groups and the R group in the O- position forms a stable radical, generally is benzylic for polymerization to occur successfully. NMP allows for excellent control of chain length and structure, as well as a relative lack of true termination that allows polymerization to continue as long as there is available monomer. Because of this it is said to be ‚Äúliving\\".  Persistent radical effect  The living nature of NMP is due to the persistent radical effect (PRE).Bertin, D., et al. Chem. Soc. Rev., 2011, 40, 2189‚Äì2198 The PRE is a phenomenon observable in some radical systems which leads to the highly favored formation of one product to the near exclusion of other radical couplings due to one of the radical species being particularly stable, existing in greater and greater concentrations as the reaction progresses while the other one is transient, reacting quickly with either itself in a termination step or with the persistent radical to form a desired product. As time goes on, a higher concentration of the persistent radical is present, which couples reversibly with itself, meaning that any of the transient radical still present tends to couple with the persistent radical rather than itself due to greater availability. This leads to a greater proportion of cross-coupling than self-coupling in radical species.Fischer, Hanns. Chem. Rev., 2001, 101 (12), 3581‚Äì3610. In the case of a nitroxide-mediated polymerization reaction, the persistent radical is the nitroxide species and the transient radical is always the carbon radical. This leads to repeated coupling of the nitroxide to the growing end of the polymer chain, which would ordinarily be considered a termination step, but is in this case reversible. Because of the high rate of coupling of the nitroxide to the growing chain end, there is little coupling of two active growing chains, which would be an irreversible terminating step limiting the chain length. The nitroxide binds and unbinds to the growing chain, protecting it from termination steps. This ensures that any available monomer can be easily scavenged by active chains. Because this polymerization process does not naturally self-terminate, this polymerization process is described as ‚Äúliving,‚Äù as the chains continue to grow under suitable reaction conditions whenever there is reactive monomer to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù them. Because of the PRE, it can be assumed that at any given time, almost all of the growing chains are ‚Äúcapped‚Äù by a mediating nitroxide, meaning that they dissociate and grow at very similar rates, creating a largely uniform chain length and structure.Hawker, C.J., Barclay, G.G., Dao, J.J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118 (46), 11467‚Äì11471. Nitroxide stability As stated above, nitroxide radicals are effective mediators of well-controlled radical polymerization because they are quite stable, allowing them to act as persistent radicals in a reaction mixture. This stability is a result of their unique structure. In most diagrams, the radical is depicted on the oxygen, but another resonance structure exists which is more helpful in explaining their stability in which the radical is on the nitrogen, which has a double bond to the oxygen. In addition to this resonance stability, nitroxides used in NMRP always contain bulky, sterically hindering groups in the R1 and R2 positions. The significant steric bulk of these substituents entirely prevents radical coupling in the N-centered resonance form while significantly reducing it in the O-centered form. These bulky groups contribute stability, but only if there is no resonance provided by allyl or aromatic groups Œ± to the N. These result in decreased stability of the nitroxide, presumably because they offer less sterically hindered sites for radical coupling to take place.Volodarsky, L.B., Reznikov, V.A., Ovcharenko, V.I. Synthetic Chemistry of Stable Nitroxides. CRC Press, 1994. The resulting inactivity of the radical makes hemolytic cleavage of the alkoxyamine quite fast in more sterically hindered species.Bertin, D., et al. Chem. Soc. Rev., 2011, 40, 2189‚Äì2198  Nitroxide choice  The choice of a specific nitroxide species to use has a large effect on the efficacy of an attempted polymerization. An effective polymerization (fast rate of chain growth, consistent chain length) results from a nitroxide with a fast C-O homolysis and relatively few side reactions. A more polar solvent lends itself better to C-O homolysis, so polar solvents which cannot bind to a labile nitroxide are the most effective for NMP. It is generally agreed that the structural factor that has the greatest effect on the ability of a nitroxide to mediate a radical polymerization is steric bulk. Generally speaking, greater steric bulk on the nitroxide leads to greater strain on the alkoxyamine, leading to the most easily broken bond, the C-O single bond, cleaving homolytically.  Ring size  In the case of cyclic nitroxides, five-membered ring systems have been shown to cleave more slowly than six- membered rings and acyclic nitroxides with t-butyl moieties as their R groups cleaved fastest of all. This difference in the rate of cleavage was determined to result not from a difference in C-O bond lengths, but in the difference of C-O-N bond angle in the alkoxyamine. The smaller the bond angle the greater the steric interaction between the nitroxide and the alkyl fragment and the more easily the initiator species broke apart.Moad, G., Rizzardo, E. Macromolecules, 1995, 28, 8722‚Äì8728.  Steric bulk  The efficiency of polymerization increases more and more with increased steric bulk of the nitroxide up to a point. TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) is capable of inducing the polymerization of styrene and styrene derivatives fairly easily, but is not sufficiently labile to induce polymerization of butyl acrylate under most conditions. TEMPO derivatives with even bulkier groups at the positions Œ± to N have a rate of homolysis great enough to induce NMP of butyl acrylate, and the bulkier the Œ± groups, the faster polymerization occurs. This indicates that the steric bulk of the nitroxide fragment can be a good indicator of the strength of an alkoxyamine initiator, at least up to a point. The equilibrium of its homolysis and reformation favors the radical form to the extent that recombination to reform an alkoxyamine over the course of NMP occurs too slowly to maintain control of chain length.Siegenthaler, K.O., Studer, A. Macromolecules, 2006, 39(4), 1347‚Äì1352.  Preparation methods  Because TEMPO, which is commercially available, is a sufficient nitroxide mediator for the synthesis of polystyrene derivatives, the preparation of alkoxyamine initiators for NMP of copolymers is in many cases a matter of attaching a nitroxide group (TEMPO) to a specifically synthesized alkyl fragment. Several methods have been reported to achieve this transformation. Jacobsen's catalyst Jacobsen's catalyst is a manganese- based catalyst commonly used for the stereoselective epoxidation of alkenes. This epoxidation proceeds by a radical addition mechanism, which can be taken advantage of by introducing the radical TEMPO group into the reaction mixture. After treatment with a mild reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, this yields the product of a Markovnikov addition of nitroxide to the alkene. Jacobsen‚Äôs catalyst is fairly mild, and a wide variety of functionalities on the alkene substrate can be tolerated. Practical yields are not necessarily as high as those reported by Dao et al., however. Dao, J., Benoit, D., Hawker, C.J.J. Poly. Sci., 1998, 36, 2161‚Äì2167. Hydrazine An alternative method is to react a substrate with a C-Br bond at the desired location of the nitroxide with hydrazine, generating an alkyl substituted hydrazine which is then exposed to a nitroxide radical and a mild oxidating agent such as lead dioxide. This generates a carbon-centered radical which couples with the nitroxide to generate the desired alkoxyamine. This method has the disadvantage of being relatively inefficient for some species, as well as the inherent danger of having to work with extremely toxic hydrazine and the inconvenience of having to run reactions in inert atmosphere.Braslo, R., et al. Macromolecules, 1997, 30, 6445‚Äì6450. Treatment of aldehydes with hydrogen peroxide Yet another published alkoxyamine synthesis involves treatment of aldehydes with hydrogen peroxide, which adds to the carbonyl group. The resulting species rearranges in situ in the presence of CuCl forming formic acid and the desired alkyl radical, which couples with tempo to produce the target alkoxyamine. The reaction appears to give fairly good yields and tolerates a variety of functional groups in the alkyl chain. Schoening, K.U., et al. J. Org. Chem. 2009, 74, 1567‚Äì1573. Electrophilic bromination and nucleophilic attack A synthesis has been described by Moon and Kang consisting of a one-electron reduction of a nitroxide radical in metallic sodium to yield a nucleophilic nitroxide. The nitroxide nucleophile is then added to an appropriate alkyl bromide, yielding the alkoxyamine by a simple SN2 reaction. This technique has the advantage of requiring only the appropriate alkyl bromide to be synthesized without requiring inconvenient reaction conditions and extremely hazardous reagents like Braso et al.‚Äôs method.Moon, B., Minjyuk, K. Macromol. Res., 2005, 13(3), 229‚Äì235.

It is based on many of the packages from Arch Linux and Arch Linux ARM,Parabola GNU/Linux-libre supports ARMv7 but distinguishes from the former by offering only free software. It includes the GNU operating system components common to many Linux distributions and the Linux-libre kernel instead of the generic Linux kernel. Parabola is listed by the Free Software Foundation as a completely free operating system, true to their Free System Distribution Guidelines. Parabola uses a rolling release model like Arch, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest software. Development focuses on system simplicity, community involvement and use of the latest free software packages.  History  Parabola was originally proposed by members of the gNewSense IRC channel in 2009. Members of different Arch Linux communities, especially Spanish-speaking members, started the development and maintenance of the project software and documentation. On May 20, 2011, the Parabola distribution was recognized as a completely free project by GNU, making it part of the FSF list of free distributions. In February 2012 Dmitrij D. Czarkoff reviewed Parabola for OSNews. Czarkoff reported that on his test computer a number of hardware problems surfaced, due to lack of free firmware. He said \\"That effectively means that many devices are not supported in Parabola. Eg., after installing it on my Acer Aspire One 531h netbook I couldn't use my Broadcom bluetooth module and Intel's WiFi/WiMax Link 5150 adapter. (I still could use my HTC Magic with a custom Gingerbread ROM as a USB 3G/WiFi modem, though having something always connected to USB port is pretty annoying on laptop and specifically on netbook.)\\" Czarkoff also criticized the lack of documentation available for Parabola. He concluded \\"The overall impression of the Parabola GNU/Linux user experience exactly matches the one of Arch: a system with easy and flexible installation and configuration process and good choice of free software packages. Though the lack of documentation spoils the user experience, the Arch Linux resources can be used to further configure and extend the distribution. If my hardware would allow, I would probably stick with Parabola.\\" Parabola used to have a mips64el port to provide support for the Chinese Loongson processor used in the Lemote Yeeloong laptop. It was discontinued due to a lack of resources and interest, and the final activity was seen in July 2014. Robert Rijkhoff reviewed Parabola GNU/Linux for DistroWatch in September 2017.DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 729, 11 September 2017  Differences from Arch and Arch ARM  Parabola GNU/Linux-libre running the MATE desktop environment The project uses only 100% free software from the official Arch repositories for the i686 and x86-64 architectures and official Arch ARM repositories (except [alarm] and [aur]) for the ARMv7. It uses free replacements when possible, such as the Linux-libre kernel instead of the generic Linux kernel. The filtering process removes around 700 software packages from the repositories that do not meet the requirements of the Free Software Definition for each architecture. Social contract Parabola has established a Social Contract. The Parabola Social Contract commits the project to the free software community (viewing itself as only competing against nonfree systems), free culture, democracy, and to follow Arch's philosophy. Under the covenant are included the GNU Free System Distribution Guidelines. Installation There are two ways to install Parabola, either from scratch using installable ISO images, or by migrating from an existing Arch-based system. The latter process is almost as simple as switching to the Parabola repositories list. TalkingParabola TalkingParabola is a derivative install CD based on TalkingArch. It is a respin of the Parabola ISO modified to include speech and braille output for blind and visually impaired users. TalkingParabola retains all the features of the Parabola live image, but adds speech and braille packages to make it possible for blind and visually impaired users to install Parabola eyes-free.  Mascots  The Parabola community has created a number of cartoon characters for the project. The characters are a gnu and a cat named \\"Bola\\", who is conceived after Parabola's main characteristics: \\"elegant, minimalist and lightweight\\".

The letter spoke about the adverse social and economic circumstances in which Croatian Serbs had lived. Content of the letter The letter was a result of extensive studies about respect for minority rights in Croatia, which were initiated by the Serb Democratic Forum and other partner NGOs of the Forum, like UNHCR, University of Zagreb and other Serbian NGOs. The study drew attention to problems such as long-term trials, verbal insults, physical attacks, and the devastation of buildings and religious objects belonging to the Serbian minority. Some media, such as Jutarnji list, published criticisms of the implementation of the Erdut Agreement. The study found that Nova TV and Veƒçernji list are at the forefront of hate speech in the media. The study also addressed the phenomenon of nationalist singer Marko Perkoviƒá. According to the study, Serbs in Croatia are marginalized, their ethnic identity is stigmatized, and the blame is placed on them for the 1991-95 war. It highlighted that the regions where Serbs have lived for centuries have been devastated and economically neglected. The letter said that there have been some developments in human and minority rights, but it warned of a lack of implementation of good legislation. The letter noted that Serbs in Croatia still do not have equal opportunities for socialization or the same level of human rights, ethnic or professional recognition, particularly in areas where they have returned to live recently. The letter stated that for positive change to occur it would be necessary for the majority population to perceive the minority population as having a richness of living environment and not as presenting a threat to society. Reactions The Serb Democratic Forum did not invite the Independent Democratic Serb Party to sign the open letter, taking the view that, as part of the government, they hold some responsibility for the marginalization of the Serbian minority. This subsequently led to clashes between the Serb Democratic Forum, the Independent Democratic Serb Party and the Party of Danube Serbs.

B. Charcot\\" - From his book 15,000 Miles in a Ketch. Raymond Rallier du Baty (30 August 1881 ‚Äì 7 May 1978) was a French sailor and explorer, from Lorient in Brittany, who carried out surveys of the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean in the early 20th century. Rallier du Baty took part in the 1904-1907 Third French Antarctic Expedition led by Jean-Baptiste Charcot. From September 1907 to July 1909 Captain Raymond Rallier du Baty sailed from Boulogne to Melbourne in a French fishing ketch, known as the J. B. Charcot. The J. B. Charcot weighed forty- eight tons and completed this trip in 15,000 miles. The reason for this voyage was primarily to chart the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands. Du Baty and his brother Henri du Baty funded this expedition by harvesting the oil of the southern elephant seals in the area. Raymond Rallier du Baty wrote a book detailing his experience on the J. B. Charcot, entitled 15,000 Miles in a Ketch. They returned again in 1913-1914 in La Curieuse to carry out further surveys. These efforts led to the publication of the first full map of the archipelago in 1922. Rallier du Baty is commemorated in several geographic features, including P√©ninsule Rallier du Baty in the Kerguelen Archipelago, and Rallier Island and Rallier Channel in the Wilhelm Archipelago of the Antarctic Peninsula.
